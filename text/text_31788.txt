BACKGROUND
archaea are the least well-characterized members among the extant three domains of life, and recent genome sequencing efforts have facilitated our understanding of these unusual microbes  <cit> . the phylum euryarchaeota contains a diverse array of archaea currently classified under eight named classes  and ten orders  <cit> . members of the euryarchaeota, particularly those of halobacteria, have received attention because of their ecological and evolutionary importance. halophilic archaea are physiologically and phylogenetically diverse and occur in a wide variety of environments  <cit> . most halophilic archaea thrive in hypersaline environments . to survive in such extreme conditions, these organisms have evolved strategies to cope with not only osmotic stress and desiccation, but also oxygen limitation and the damaging effects of uv light  <cit> . the haloalkaliphiles constitute a distinct group of microorganisms since they survive in two extremes: high ph and hypersalinity  <cit> . in addition, haloalkaliphilic archaea have an asymmetric c <dig> c <dig> diether isoprenoid core lipid that is uncommon among neutrophilic halophilic archaea  <cit> .

the genus natrialba within halobacteria is a heterogeneous group of halophiles including those that thrive in neutral as well as alkaline environments  <cit> . the type species natrialba asiatica, which was isolated from a beach in japan, is non-alkaliphilic and requires a ph of  <dig>  to  <dig>  for optimum growth  <cit> . natrialba magadii  is an obligately haloalkaliphilic archaeon that requires 20%  nacl, ph  <dig> , and  <dig> to 40°c for optimum growth  <cit> . in contrast to the white-yellow color of nab. asiaticanab. magadii is red-orange colored due to the presence of carotenoid pigments in the cell membrane  <cit> . furthermore, nab. magadii lacks glycolipids, whereas nab. asiatica contains bis-sulfated glycolipid s2-dgd { <dig>  3-diphytanyl- or phytanyl-sesterterpenyl-1--sn-glycerol}  <cit> . previous work has demonstrated that nab. magadii synthesizes and accumulates 2-sulfotrahalose as an osmolyte under hypersaline conditions  <cit> . the biochemical features of the flagellar apparatus, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, a leucine dehydrogenase, and an extracellular serine protease of nab. magadi have also been characterized since its discovery  <cit> .

although knowledge on the biology of halophilic archaea has greatly advanced during the last decade, attempts to understand the physiology and genetics of the haloalkaliphilic archaea are scarce  <cit> . the study of haloalkaliphilic archaea is interesting from several perspectives because these are among the most alkaliphilic microorganisms reported to date  <cit> . of the halophilic archaea related to nab. magadii, a low pass genomic sequence of nab. asiatica strain atcc  <dig> has been reported  <cit> . the genome of haloterrigena turkmenica strain dsm  <dig>  a halophilic archaeon isolated from sulfate saline soil in turkmenistan, is complete and contains  <dig>  protein coding genes  <cit> . furthermore, the complete genome of natronomonas pharaonis dsm  <dig>  a haloalkaliphilic archaeon isolated from a soda lake in egypt, contains  <dig>  protein coding genes  <cit> . in addition, a detailed analysis of the metabolic pathways of halophilic archaea has been described  <cit> . the goal of the current study was to explore the physiology of nab. magadii at the whole genome level and perform comparative genomic studies with other halophilic as well as haloalkaliphilic archaea. an exploration of the pathways of coenzyme biosynthesis and proteolysis within nab. magadii was also envisaged.

methods
nab. magadii was grown at 37°c aerobically in liquid medium containing  <dig> g/l yeast extract using the method of tindall et al.  <cit> , and genomic dna was extracted from the pelleted cells using the procedure described by ng et al. for halobacterium halobium   <cit> . genomic library construction, sequencing, and finishing were performed at the joint genome institute  facilities at walnut creek and the genome science facilities at los alamos national laboratory. briefly, the draft genome of nab. magadii was sequenced using a combination of both sanger and  <dig> technologies. a sanger whole genome shotgun library, which produced  <dig>  reads with an average insert size of  <dig>  kb, and a  <dig> flx standard library, which generated  <dig>  mbp of data, were constructed for this genome. all general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the jgi can be found at http://www.jgi.doe.gov/. the phred/phrap/consed software package  was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment. after the shotgun stage, reads were assembled with parallel phrap . possible mis-assemblies were corrected with dupfinisher or transposon bombing of bridging clones . gaps between contigs were closed by editing in consed, custom primer walk, or pcr amplification . a total of  <dig> additional custom primer reactions were necessary to close all gaps and raise the quality of the finished sequence. the estimated error rate for the completed genome of nab. magadii was less than  <dig> in  <dig> . the final assembly was based on  <dig>  mbp of sanger draft data, which provided  <dig> x coverage of the genome, and  <dig>  mbp of  <dig> draft data, which provided  <dig> x coverage of the genome.

preliminary automated annotation, prediction of the number of subsystems, and pairwise blast comparisons of protein sets within different strains were performed using the rapid annotation using subsystems technology , which is a fully automated, prokaryotic genome annotation service  <cit> . subsequently, a detailed manual curation was performed to ensure consistency with the annotation of other halophilic archaea. annotation of genes involved in coenzyme biosynthesis was based on the information available in recent literature and/or their relatedness to functionally characterized homologs present in other organisms. these annotation details are provided at the web site http://wiki.rzg.mpg.de/haloferaxwiki. proteins deemed to be specific to nab. magadii were compared against the ncbi non-redundant protein database to determine whether they were hypothetical or conserved hypothetical. if there was no adequate alignment with any protein , the translated orf was named a hypothetical protein.

multiple genome comparisons were performed using the ‘progressive alignment’ option available in the program mauve version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . default scoring and parameters were used for generating the alignment. prior to the alignment, the nab. magadii genome sequence was rearranged to facilitate visual comparison. this was accomplished using the artemis comparison tool to identify a coordinate where the sequence was shifted relative to that of htg. turkmenica. the coordinate was located at  <dig> bp and the nab. magadii sequence was cut starting at this coordinate until the end of the sequence and placed at the beginning of the fasta file so that the genome start was near the major origin of replication.

a synteny plot was generated using the program nucmer, which uses exact matching, clustering, and alignment extension strategies to create a dot plot based on the number of identical alignments between two genomes  <cit> . nucmer was used with the maxmatch argument and, to be consistent with the mauve comparison, the rearranged nab. magadii sequence was aligned with that of htg. turkmenica. the nab. magadii genome project is deposited in the genomes online database  and the complete genome sequence is available from genbank/embl/ddbj with accession numbers cp <dig>  cp <dig>  cp <dig>  and cp <dig>  the genome of nab. magadii is also accessible through halolex  and the ucsc archaeal genome browser .

RESULTS
nab. magadii genome features and comparison with the genomes of other halophilic archaea
the complete genome sequence of nab. magadii consisted of four replicons . three of these elements had a gc content of ~61% whereas pnmag <dig> had a gc content of  <dig> %. a comparison of some of the relevant features of these four elements is shown in table  <dig>  a blastn analysis of pnmag <dig> on the ncbi database revealed 99% identity to halovirus φch <dig> , a bacteriophage-like element isolated from nab. magadii. since halovirus φch <dig> has already been described elsewhere  <cit> , the analysis of pnmag <dig> was excluded from the scope of the current work. the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained two genes encoding putative replication factor c-like proteins . the large chromosome, pnmag <dig>  and pnmag <dig> were predicted to replicate using a conserved archaeal mechanism  <cit> , since each of these replicons contained at least one gene encoding an orc1/cdc <dig> family replication initiation protein. for the large chromosome, the major replication origin was predicted to be at ca  <dig>  mb, located between orc <dig>  on the forward strand and a three-gene operon on the reverse strand . this set of four highly conserved genes was found adjacent to the replication origin in almost all halophilic archaea.

archaeal genomes can contain a large number of transposable elements and the variety of archaeal insertion sequences is thought to approximate that of bacteria  <cit> . however, most archaeal genomes lack prophage elements  <cit> . manual curation indicated that the genome of nab. magadii contained ~ <dig> full-length or truncated genes encoding putative transposases. these insertion sequence elements were scattered throughout the chromosomes and about  <dig> of these belong to the is <dig> orfb family. the is <dig> orfb transposase  genes were highly diverse, as is typical of halophilic archaea  <cit> . a single is <dig> orfa  was identified in the genome. other transposase genes in nab. magadii include  <dig> of the broad category is <dig> , a single is240-type, and  <dig> related to issod <dig>  the small number of transposase genes and their heterogeneity may indicate that nab. magadii is only minimally affected by these elements. the genome also contained several genes related to bacteriophage elements  and a vgr-like gene related to recombination hot spot elements. in addition, there were  <dig> genes encoding integrase/recombinase-like proteins .

archaeal genomes generally have 1– <dig> rrna operons consisting of the  <dig> s,  <dig> s, and  <dig> s rrna genes with a trnaala gene located in the internal transcribed spacer  <cit> . the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained two copies of  <dig> s rrna-trnaala- <dig> s rrna- <dig> s rrna sequences, one each on the plus and minus strands, as well as two genes encoding components of the rna guide machinery  with fibrillarin-like rna methyltransferase as the catalytic component. the small chromosome pnmag <dig> contained a copy of  <dig> s rrna-trnaala- <dig> s rrna- <dig> s rrna sequence on the minus strand and a copy of  <dig> s rrna- <dig> s rrna sequence on the plus strand. the three  <dig> s rrna-trnaala- <dig> s rrna- <dig> s rrna sequences of nab. magadii had 99% nucleotide identity to each other. the small chromosome pnmag <dig> also contained an orphan  <dig> s rrna sequence that had 89% nucleotide identity to the other four  <dig> s rrna genes of nab. magadii. since pnmag <dig> lacked rrna operons and had a lesser gc content than the large and small chromosomes, this self replicating element could be considered a large plasmid. the heterogeneity of the rrna operons within nab. magadii is not a unique feature and the occurrence of such rrna operons among halobacterial genomes is thought to be due to recombination between rrna genes of different strains or species  <cit> . the  <dig> s rrna genes of nab. magadii were closely related to those of nab. asiatica , htg. turkmenica , and nmn. pharaonis . furthermore, the genome of nab. magadii was compared to  <dig> complete haloarchaeal genomes available in the public databases . based on this analysis, htg. turkmenica contained the highest number of orthologs , followed by halopiger xanaduensis strain sh- <dig> . there were lesser number of orthologs  in nmn. pharaonis, which has a relatively smaller genome. however, when the data for the percentage of proteins having a bidirectional best blast hit in nab. magadii was computed , nmn. pharaonis was the top , followed by hpg. xanaduensis  and htg. turkmenica . results from nmn. pharaonis and htg. turkmenica are emphasized in this paper since the former was the only other haloalkaliphilic archaeon with a complete genome sequence and the latter contained the highest number of orthologs.

the combined size of the complete genome of nab. magadii was  <dig>  mb larger than the complete genome of nmn. pharaonis, which consists of three replicons . however, nab. magadii genome was  <dig> mb smaller than the complete genome of htg. turkmenica, which consists of seven replicons . the gc content  of the large chromosome of nab. magadii was slightly lesser than that of the large chromosomes of htg. turkmenica  and nmn. pharaonis . alignment of the large chromosome of nmn. pharaonis  with that of nab. magadii using mauve showed the presence of very few short syntenic regions , whereas a similar alignment using the large chromosome of htg. turkmenica  showed the presence of numerous short syntenic regions . to further dissect this co-linearity, a blastn comparison of the large chromosomes of nab. magadii and htg. turkmenica was performed. this analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> homologous regions  with an average nucleic acid identity of 89% . the plus and minus strand matches among the chromosomes of htg. turkmenica and nab. magadii generated by nucmer are shown in figure 1b.

a three-way comparison of all predicted protein-coding genes of nab. magadii using the taxplot tool of ncbi revealed that htg. turkmenica contained  <dig> orthologs, whereas nmn. pharaonis contained only  <dig> orthologs . these analyses further confirmed that nab. magadii was more closely related to htg. turkmenica than to nmn. pharaonis. in nab. magadii,  <dig> genes could not be assigned a function based on blast analysis and were annotated as encoding hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins. the isoelectric point  of most of the predicted proteins of nab. magadii was in the 3– <dig> range, indicating that the general proteome is acidic, which is typical of most halophilic archaea. a two-way comparison of the large chromosomes revealed that nab. magadii contained ~ <dig> putative protein-coding genes that had no homologs in htg. turkmenica. a vast majority  of these nab. magadii-specific genes encoded hypothetical proteins. other genome-specific genes in nab. magadii encoded abc-type transporters, atpases, kinases, phosphatases, proteases, and oxidoreductases. the genome of nab. magadii also contained a variety of simple sequence repeats encoding characteristic peptide repeat patterns.

general adaptive features
in addition to maintaining an acidic proteome and a cell wall composed of acidic glycoproteins, haloalkaliphilic species appear to have evolved several other mechanisms of adaptation to their niche  <cit> . these include, but are not limited to, intracellular accumulation of inorganic cations and/or neutral organic compounds  <cit> . halophilic archaea maintain the necessary water balance and osmotic pressure even when the extracellular na+ concentration exceeds  <dig> m by pumping na+ out and k+ into the cell using a variety of cation/proton antiporters  <cit> . the genome of nab. magadii contained an operon of nine genes encoding a putative ph adaptation k+ efflux system . genes related to this operon were present in several halophilic archaea, indicating that they may not encode a specialized system involved in stress response to alkaline growth conditions. apart from this operon, the genome contained three other genes encoding putative cation/proton antiporters and a gene encoding a putative osmc family protein .

low molecular weight organic compounds such as amino acids, polyols, and sugars facilitate cellular adaptation to high-osmolarity and are referred to as osmoprotectants or compatible solutes  <cit> . halophilic species also accumulate neutral organic compounds as a means of adaptation to their niche  <cit> . the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained a locus encoding a putative trehalose-phosphate synthase and a trehalose-phosphatase, which may be involved in the biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant 2-sulfotrehalose. the orthologs of these genes were found in few other halophilic archaea and the osmolyte has been detected by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis in nab. magadii <cit> . nab. magadii also contained genes encoding the biosynthesis of spermine as well as transporters for the uptake of choline/carnitine/betaine and spermidine/putrescine, which may also provide protection at high-osmolarity . therefore, it appeared that nab. magadii had multiple mechanisms  for osmotic adaptation.

the scarcity of molecular oxygen in a hypersaline milieu could be a growth-limiting factor for aerobic chemoorganotrophic prokaryotes  <cit> . it has been proposed that some archaeal species accumulate intracellular gas vesicles that help them float on the surface and perform oxidative respiration in their native saturated saltwater habitats  <cit> . the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained a cluster of  <dig> genes encoding putative gas vesicle synthesis family proteins, which were related to the gas vesicle family proteins of hbt. salinarum. however, nab. magadii lacked genes related to those encoding the minor gas vesicle protein  and the regulators . the gas vesicle gene clusters of nab. magadii and htg. turkmenica were highly similar to each other and appeared to contain a distant homolog of the hbt. salinarum gvpi gene . nevertheless, these genes encode putative proteins with an n-terminal extension of more than  <dig> residues not found in gvpi of hbt. salinarum. furthermore, the gas vesicle clusters of nab. magadii and htg. turkmenica contained an additional gene  that was absent in hbt. salinarum. nab. magadii also contained a gene encoding a hemat-type aerotactic transducer with a putative globin-coupled sensor protein comprising of a globin fold domain and a methyl-accepting chemotaxis transducer domain . these traits, in addition to the osmotic adaptation mechanisms discussed above, may play a role in the survival of nab. magadii in its natural environment.

other features likely to facilitate the adaptation of nab. magadii to its niche included genes encoding putative mechanosensitive ion channels  that afford protection against hypoosmotic shock, chaperone proteins dnaj and dnak, a thermosome, and heat shock proteins that may participate in protein quality control and cellular response to stress. nab. magadii also contained  <dig> genes  encoding putative proteins of various sizes with a universal stress protein  domain. one of these genes  appeared to form an operon with a gene encoding a putative gcn5-related n-acetyltransferase , and a similar gene pair was found in htg. turkmenica  and nmn. pharaonis . it is possible that the gnat is involved in the acetylation of the linked universal stress protein in these species. in addition, the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained genes encoding a superoxide dismutase , two catalases , two alkyl-hydroperoxidase-like proteins, a carbonic anhydrase, and methionine sulfoxide reductases . it is possible that these enzymes have a role in the adaptation of this haloarchaeon to various oxidative stresses associated with energy metabolism.

furthermore, nab. magadii contained genes encoding metal transport proteins and a putative copper resistance protein. nab. magadii copper resistance protein appears to contain fused copc-copd domains and a distant homolog of this protein occurs in nmn. pharaonis , but not in other archaea. these genes may be involved in metal homeostasis in the hypersaline environment that nab. magadii inhabits. nab. magadii also encoded dna methylases, dna damage repair excinuclease abc subunits, dna mismatch repair proteins, and dna repair/recombination proteins rada and radb . homologs of these genes are found in several other archaea and they are predicted to be involved in stress response and maintaining genetic integrity.

proteases, peptidases, protease inhibitors, and protein translocation
at least  <dig> genes encoding various types of peptidases/proteases were identified in the genome of nab. magadii by manual curation . interestingly, nab. magadii appears to encode a larger set of proteolytic enzymes compared to most halophilic archaea, including nmn. pharaonis, hfx. volcanii and hbt. salinarum. this suggests that the natural environment inhabited by nab. magadii contains an ample supply of protein debris, which could be used as a major carbon and nitrogen source. the closest homologs of the vast majority of nab. magadii genes  encoding putative peptidases/proteases were found in htg. turkmenica . most of the nab. magadii predicted proteases belong to the catalytic type of metallo- and serine proteases. other proteases include various amino- and carboxypeptidases, oligopeptidases, signal peptidases, atp-dependent proteases, and intramembrane cleaving proteases .

subtilases  are a large superfamily of functionally diverse endo- and exo-peptidases that occur in prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . nab. magadii contained nine genes encoding putative s <dig> and s <dig> subtilisin kexin sedolisins . although the predicted subtilisins of nab. magadii had diverse sizes , the amino acid motifs containing the catalytic triad  were conserved in all of them. six of the predicted subtilisins  of nab. magadii contained putative targeting signals for translocation through the twin-arginine transport  pathway, suggesting that these proteases are most likely exported out of the cell. within this group, nmag_ <dig> has been biochemically characterized and designated as the natrialba extracellular protease   <cit> . nep was demonstrated to be alkali-resistant, a feature that correlates with the conditions that predominate in the natural environment of nab. magadii <cit> . interestingly, the c-terminal domain of nep contains an acidic patch composed of  <dig> amino acid residues that is absent in the subtilases of neutrophilic organisms  <cit> . this distinctive feature of nep may be involved in its stability at high salt and/or high ph. in addition, pnmag <dig> contained a gene encoding a putative microcystin lr degradation protein . mlrc peptidases, initially isolated from the bacterium sphingomonas, are a specialized group of metalloproteases assigned to m <dig> family and they participate in the last step of the degradation pathway of microcystin lr  <cit> . these enzymes rarely occur in the archaeal domain and the homologs of nmag_ <dig> were not found in nmn. pharaonis and htg. turkmenica .

all archaeal genomes studied to date are predicted to encode self-compartmentalized proteases  likely to function in energy-dependent proteolysis and an ubiquitin-type mechanism for targeting proteins to proteasomes termed sampylation  <cit> . in archaea,  <dig> s proteasomes of α- and β-type subunits are thought to function with aaa-atpases such as the proteasome-activating nucleotidase  in degrading folded proteins  <cit> . in addition, ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifier proteins  appear to be conjugated to protein targets by an e1-like enzyme termed ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme of archaea or ubaa . the genome of nab. magadii contained an operon encoding putative  <dig> s proteasome α and β subunits . apart from this operon, the genome contained separate genes encoding  <dig> s proteasome α and β subunit homologs . nab. magadii was also predicted to encode homologs of pan  and ubiquitin-like small archaeal modifier proteins . the genome of nab. magadi contained two genes encoding putative ubiquitin-like activating enzymes of archaea . furthermore, it also encoded a distant homolog of ubaa  containing a c-terminal jab1/mpn/mov <dig> metalloenzyme  domain that was predicted to remove samps from target proteins. in contrast, hfx. volcanii encodes only a single ubaa-type protein that functions in both protein conjugation  and sulfur mobilization  <cit> . nab. magadii also encoded an archaeal-type lonb protease , which was demonstrated in its cell membranes  <cit> . while lonb homologs are conserved and likely act as key energy-dependent proteases in archaea, the physiological significance of these enzymes has not been addressed.

the tetrahedral aminopeptidase  is an energy-independent protein complex  that was isolated from the neutrophilic haloarchaeon har. marismortui <cit> . it has been suggested that tet degrades oligopeptides released by atp-dependent proteases such as the proteasome and lonb. nab. magadii encodes a homolog of tet , which, in combination with the energy-dependent proteases, may participate in the intracellular protein turnover in this extremophile. furthermore, similar to the majority of haloarchaea, nab. magadii appears to encode homologs of the three families of membrane-embedded regulatory proteases denoted as i-clips. these include sppa-type signal peptide peptidases , site- <dig> protease class of zinc metalloproteases that cleave transmembrane domains , and rhomboids . furthermore, nab. magadii contained genes encoding type i signal peptidases  and a type iv prepilin peptidase . the type i signal peptidases and the type iv prepilin peptidase are predicted to be involved in the processing of n-terminal signal peptides of exported proteins and flagellin precursors, respectively.

cellular protease activity is frequently controlled by endogenous protease inhibitors  <cit> . genes encoding putative homologs of protease inhibitors of the serpin  and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein  types were present in nab. magadii. a subtilisin protease inhibitor from this archaeon, denoted nsi, was previously purified and biochemically characterized  <cit> . this protease inhibitor remains to be investigated at the molecular level and the availability of its gene sequence could facilitate cloning and expression of the recombinant protein for further analysis. a representation of the major proteolytic systems  of nab. magadii is presented in figure  <dig>  although this depiction assumes that the proteolytic systems of nab. magadii are independent of each other, their synergistic action in vivo cannot be ruled out.

protein translocation across the cell membrane in prokaryotes is facilitated by at least three mechanisms including the general secretion  system, the specialized tat system, and the highly ornate, substrate-specific secretion systems for delivering effector proteins to target sites  <cit> . nab. magadii contained genes that encoded putative components of the sec system  and of the sec-independent tat protein translocase complex . while the tat pathway is commonly used for a small subset of exported proteins in bacteria, it is a dominant export route in halophilic archaea. many of the exported proteins are subsequently attached to the cell membrane by a lipid anchor and nab. magadii has  <dig> genes encoding lipid-modified tat target proteins, as detected by tatlipo analysis  <cit> . furthermore, nab. magadii contained genes encoding putative components of a type ii secretion system  and an archaeosortase  for which  <dig> targets with pgf_cterm motif were identified  <cit> .

n-glycosylation, glycosyltransferases, and polysaccharide biosynthesis
n-glycosylation in archaea and eukaryotes uses dolichol phosphate as the lipid base for the assembly of oligosaccharides  <cit> . glycosyltransferases  are key components of n-glycosylation in all three domains of life, and the genome of nab. magadii contained  <dig> genes encoding putative gts. based on blastp analysis on the ncbi database and the presence of conserved domains, these genes were assigned into the gta  and gtb  superfamilies. one of these genes  is in an operon with nmag_ <dig> , nmag_ <dig> , nmag_ <dig> , and nmag_ <dig> . nab. magadii also contained genes encoding a putative oligosaccharyltransferase subunit  and a dolichol kinase-like protein . therefore, nab. magadii appears to have the genetic potential for n-glycosylation.

several species of halophilic archaea are known to produce copious amounts of extracellular polysaccharides  <cit> . although transmission electron microscopic  images show the presence of an exopolysaccharide-like material around nab. magadii cells , purification and biochemical analyses of this material are yet to be accomplished. nab. magadii contained six genes encoding putative polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins . other genes in the genome that encoded putative enzymes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis included six polysaccharide deacetylases , two polyprenyl glycosyl-phosphotransferases , an o-antigen polymerase , two udp-n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases , an acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase , an o-acetyltransferase , a n-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase , and two capsule synthesis proteins . it is possible that some of these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of nab. magadii exopolysaccharide- or capsule-like material identified in the tem images.

coenzyme biosynthesis
archaeal metabolic pathways are unique and diverse, in comparison to those of eubacteria  <cit> . however, the biosynthesis of several coenzymes involved in archaeal metabolism has only been partially understood. recent advances in this area include the discovery of a new heme biosynthetic pathway  <cit> , further understanding of the pathway of cobalamin biosynthesis, and the reconstruction of a complete pathway for coenzyme f <dig> biosynthesis in haloarchaea. analyses of genes putatively involved in coenzyme biosynthesis in nab. magadii was performed in light of these new discoveries. this section describes the genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamine, riboflavin, nad, coenzyme f <dig>  folate, heme, and cobalamin.

vitamin b <dig>  is involved in several microbial metabolic functions  <cit> . prokaryotes have evolved elaborate mechanisms to either synthesize this important co-factor de novo or acquire it from their niche  <cit> . thiamine biosynthetic pathways among prokaryotes are very diverse  <cit> . thiamine biosynthesis is accomplished by joining two intermediate molecules that are synthesized separately. one of these molecules is hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophospate , which is made from aminoimidazole ribotide  using thic and thid. the other molecule is hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate , which in bacteria is generated by thigh and teni and involves the sulfur carrier this. the sulfur carrier is activated for thiolylation via c-terminal adenylation catalyzed by the n-terminal e1-like domain of thii. nab. magadii contained a gene  encoding a putative thii and several ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold proteins . however, β-grasp fold proteins have multiple functions in halophilic archaea, being involved in sulfur chemistry as well as ubiquitin-like protein modification by sampylation  <cit> . the specific β-grasp fold protein likely to participate in thiamine biosynthesis in nab. magadii remains unidentified.

furthermore, nab. magadii lacked homologs of thig, thih, and teni involved in het-p biosynthesis in bacteria. interestingly, nab. magadii encoded a homolog of the yeast het-p synthase thi <dig> . however, nmag_ <dig> is currently annotated as ribose- <dig> -bisphosphate isomerase based on the functional characterization of the ortholog mj <dig> from methanocaldococcus jannaschii. in contrast, the ortholog of nmag_ <dig> in pyrococcus kodokaraensis  does not have ribose- <dig> -bisphosphate isomerase activity  <cit> . biochemical characterization is required to ascertain the potential role of nmag_ <dig> in thiamine biosynthesis. the genome of nab. magadii contained purm  and thic  homologs, which were predicted to be involved in air and hmp biosynthesis, respectively .

two distinct proteins, thie and thin, are known to join hmp-pp and het-p to generate thiamine phosphate. nab. magadii and other halophilic archaea contain both enzymes. whereas thie  is a monofunctional protein, thin  exists as a c-terminal domain in a thidn fusion protein. at the last step, thiamine phosphate is predicted to be further phosphorylated to thiamine pyrophosphate by thil . therefore, the conversion of air to hmp-pp in nab. magadii appears to be similar to the bacterial pathway and may involve thic and thid, whereas het-p biosynthesis in this haloarchaeon appears to be similar to the eukaryotic pathway and may involve nmag_ <dig>  in addition, nab. magadii contained genes encoding a het kinase  and a thiamine transporter .

vitamin b <dig>  is the precursor of coenzymes flavin mononucleotide  and flavin adenine dinucleotide , which are cofactors for several biochemical reactions  <cit> . most bacteria, fungi, and plants can synthesize riboflavin de novo using one molecule of gtp and two molecules of ribulose 5-phosphate as substrates  <cit> . riboflavin biosynthesis has been described in m jannaschii <cit> . in general, reduction precedes deamination in the archaeal riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, which appears to be similar to the fungal pathway. in m. jannaschii, gtp cyclohydrolase iii, the first enzyme of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, produces an archaeal-specific formylated intermediate that requires a subsequent deformylation step  <cit> . however, the haloarchaeal homolog of gtp cyclohydrolase iii has not been identified thus far. furthermore, riboflavin kinases of halophilic archaea are homologous to those of bacteria, but are unrelated to m. jannaschii riboflavin kinase. conversely, riboflavin synthases of halophilic archaea are related to those of m. jannaschii, but are unrelated to bacterial riboflavin synthases. overall, six genes encoding putative enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway were identified in nab. magadii and only two of these  were clustered together .

vitamin b <dig>  is the central component of coenzymes nad and nadp, which are essential redox cofactors in metabolism. like most bacteria, halophilic archaea synthesize nad from aspartate via quinolinate. nab. magadii contained  <dig> genes  that were predicted to be involved in nad biosynthesis.

coenzyme f <dig> is involved in methanogenesis  <cit>  and other metabolic pathways  that require hydride transfer from the low-potential reduced deazaflavin f <dig> to substrates with electron-deficient ring systems. furthermore, 5-amino-6-uracil is an intermediate of coenzyme f <dig> and riboflavin biosynthesis pathways  <cit> . although coenyzme f <dig> has been detected in some halophilic archaea  <cit> , and coenyzme f <dig> biosynthesis genes have been identified among the methanogens  <cit> , its precise function in halophilic archaea is unknown. nab. magadii and other halophilic archaea contained several genes encoding putative enzymes of the coenyzme f <dig> biosynthesis pathway. these genes were identified based on the presence of their homologs among the methanogens. furthermore, using simbal analysis  <cit> , coenyzme f <dig> dependent enzymes have been predicted in halophilic archaea . nab. magadii predicted proteins with an assigned f420-related tigrfam are shown in table  <dig>  a possible function of coenzyme f <dig> in the respiratory chain of nab. magadii is discussed later in this paper.

tetrahydrofolate participates in a number of biochemical reactions and reduced folate cofactors are required for the biosynthesis of a variety of molecules in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . the production of folate involves several enzymes catalyzing the pterin and para-aminobenzoic acid branches of the pathway  <cit> . nab. magadii genes putatively involved in folate biosynthesis were generally similar to those described in nmn. pharaonis, including the archaeal-type gtp cyclohydrolase . nab. magadii contained a pababc operon  and the homologs of these genes were predicted to be involved in para-aminobenzoate biosynthesis in nmn, pharaonis <cit> . nab. magadii also contained genes encoding a dihydropteroate synthase, a fused dihydropteroate-dihydrofolate synthase, a dihydrofolate reductase, and a methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase . the latter enzyme is predicted to participate in the conversion of the c <dig> metabolite attached to tetrahydrofolate. however, none of the other genes encoding c1-converting enzymes identified in haloquadratum or haloarcula were found in nab. magadii and nmn. pharaonis. furthermore, nab. magadii contained three genes encoding putative enzymes of the later stages of the folate biosynthesis pathway . nevertheless, genes encoding the bacterial homologs of folqbk, the atypical folq described in desulfovibrio, or the alternative pathway bypassing folqb  were absent in nab. magadii and nmn. pharaonis. therefore, precise mechanisms of folate biosynthesis in these species remain to be discovered.

environmental bacteria utilize a variety of redox molecules such as porphyrins and other modified tetrapyrroles like heme, siroheme, and adenosylcobalamin for catalysis, energy transfer, and signal transduction  <cit> . these tetrapyrroles are synthesized de novo using a branched pathway and aminolevulinic acid as the precursor  <cit> . in most prokaryotes, the conversion of glutamate to aminolevulinic acid is catalyzed by glutamyl-trna synthetase, glutamyl-trna reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. two molecules of aminolevulinic acid are condensed by the action porphobilinogen synthase to form porphobilinogen. four molecules of porphobilinogen are polymerized by the action of the porphobilinogen deaminase to form the tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane. uroporphyrinogen iii methyltransferase cyclizes hydroxymethylbilane to produce uroporphyrinogen iii. uroporphyrinogen iii is converted to precorrin- <dig> in the biosynthetic pathway of adenosylcobalamin and siroheme, which was recently found to be an intermediate of heme biosynthesis .

the complete pathway for the biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin from precorrin- <dig> involves two major branches and several enzymes  <cit> , some of which are archaea-specific   <cit> . halophilic archaea  use the “anaerobic” branch, which is characterized by an oxygen-independent ring contraction process   <cit> . however, it has been shown that halobacterium synthesizes cobalamin de novo under aerobic conditions  <cit> . the “anaerobic” branch is also characterized by early cobalt insertion and nmn. pharaonis has homologs of the atp-independent early cobalt chelatase  from bacillus halodurans and archaeoglobus fulgidus <cit> . in the “anaerobic” branch, seven archaeal enzymes are known to be involved in the conversion of precorrin- <dig> into cobyrinic acid , but two pathway gaps  still remain. a set of  <dig> genes is known to be involved in conversion of cobyrinic acid into adenosylcobalamin .

based on genome analyses, it appeared that nab. magadii was incapable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis since it lacked the genes encoding enzymes for conversion of precorrin- <dig> into cobyrinic acid. this is in contrast to htg. turkmenica, which was predicted to be capable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis since it contained the corresponding genes. however, nab. magadii was predicted to be capable of corrinoid salvage since it contained a gene encoding a putative corrinoid transporter. nab. magadii also contained a set of genes that were predicted to be involved in the conversion of cobyrinic acid into adenosylcobalamin, including a gene  that is specific to the archaeal corrinoid salvage pathway .

the heme biosynthesis pathway in archaea involving uroporphyrinogen iii, precorrin- <dig>  and siroheme appears to be similar to that of desulfovibrio <cit> . conversion of uroporphyrinogen iii into siroheme requires three functions . the enzyme catalyzing iron chelation is unknown since the haloarchaeal precorrin- <dig> dehydrogenase might be monofunctional  or might also be a ferrochelatase . from comparison of nab. magadii with other halophilic archaea, another possibility emerges: iron chelation may be performed by one of the proteins annotated as cbix-type cobalt chelatase. nmn. pharaonis has three cbix paralogs , two of which have closely related orthologs in nearly all other halophilic archaea. htg. turkmenika, probably capable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis, has orthologs of both cbix <dig> and cbix <dig>  however, nab. magadii, which is predicted to be incapable of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis, and therefore expected to lack these proposed early cobalt chelatases, surprisingly contained a cbix <dig> ortholog . it is possible that cbix <dig> functions as a ferrochelatase during siroheme/heme biosynthesis rather than as a cobaltochelatase during de novo cobalamin biosynthesis.

didecarboxysiroheme, a common intermediate of heme and heme d <dig> biosynthesis, is generated by the decarboxylation of siroheme on the c <dig> and c <dig> acetyl groups  <cit> . siroheme decarboxylase activity is attributed to the nirdlgh gene set, which is represented by a pair of two-domain proteins in halophilic archaea . heme d <dig> is a coenzyme of dissimilatory nitrite reductase  and is not required by organisms lacking this enzyme. the last steps of heme biosynthesis include the removal of acetyl side chains of fe-coproporphyrin by ahbc  and the oxidative decarboxylation of heme by ahbd   <cit>  [gene assignments: m. warren, personal communication, including the information that supplemental figure  <dig> shows the sequence of ahbc and not ahbd. orthologs encoding ahbc and ahbd were present in nmn. pharaonis  and htg. turkmenica , but not in nab. magadii. the presence of ahbc and ahbd in some halophilic archaea but not in others is believed to be due to metabolic heterogeneity rather than incomplete heme biosynthesis. conversion of heme  into heme a in nab. magadii was predicted to be catalyzed by ctaa and ctab homologs .

vitamin h, commonly known as biotin, acts as a coenzyme in several enzyme-catalyzed carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions  <cit> . most bacteria can synthesize biotin de novo using pimelic acid as a precursor, and some others have evolved mechanisms for importing this essential cofactor from their natural environments  <cit> . whereas nab. magadii is a biotin auxotroph, nmn. pharaonis is a biotin prototroph and the genome of this haloalkaliphilic archaeon has been shown to contain at least three genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of biotin  <cit> . the absence of genes for the biosynthesis of biotin in nab. magadii was apparent from the analyses of its genome sequence. however, the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained a locus encoding a putative biotin transporter , which may facilitate the uptake of biotin from the environment.

metabolic and co-factor competency
nutritional requirements of halophilic archaea in the laboratory are as diverse as their observed phenotypes, suggesting that the metabolic pathways in these organisms are quite intricate  <cit> . the analysis of the genome sequence provided an unprecedented opportunity to comprehend the metabolic versatility of nab. magadii. additional file 4: table s <dig> contains a comprehensive list of genes predicted to be involved in a diverse array of functions. furthermore, genes encoding putative enzymes for archaeal modified pathways of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis as well as those of ribose metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were present in nab. magadii. genes that encoded putative enzymes for glycerol utilization, aromatic amino acid catabolism, ureagenesis, and urea degradation were also identified in nab. magadii. other putative metabolic features of nab. magadii included xylose isomerases, an alpha amylase, a methylglyoxal synthase, sulfatases, a chlorite dismutase, sarcosine oxidases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases .

molybdenum cofactor  is essential for the functioning of molybdoenzymes such as dimethylsulfoxide and trimethylamine-n-oxide reductases, formate dehydrogenases, and nitrate reductases  <cit> . molybdopterin is the dithiolene-containing tricyclic moiety found within moco of all molybdoenzymes except nitrogenases  <cit> . in bacteria, genes of the moa, mob, mod, moe, and mog loci have been implicated in the biosynthesis of moco using gtp as the substrate  <cit> . the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained  <dig> genes encoding moco biosynthesis functions . it is uncertain if this subset of genes is sufficient for moco biosynthesis in nab. magadii and biochemical studies are required to test whether this haloarchaeon is molybdenum-dependent.

the haloarchaeon haloarcula marismortui converts acetyl-coa to glyoxylate via the key intermediate methylaspartate  <cit> . glyoxylate is condensed with a second molecule of acetyl-coa to form malate, which is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. malate can subsequently be converted to oxaloacetate, which is used by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase for gluconeogenesis. in nab. magadii, activities of the enzymes of the methylaspartate cycle, but not those of the key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, were detected  <cit> . an operon  encoding putative homologs of the methylaspartate cycle and a gene encoding a putative phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  were present in nab. magadii. the square archaeon haloquadratum walsbyi contains a gene  encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system  that is predicted to be involved in the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone  <cit> . homologs of hq2709a and genes encoding additional pts components were present in htg. turkmenicahfx. volcanii, and several other haloarchaeal genomes. however, nab. magadii and nmn. pharaonis lacked homologs of these genes encoding pts components.

respiratory chain and atp synthesis
running a proton-driven, energy-conserving atp synthase at high extracellular ph is an obvious challenge. energy coupling of sodium ions instead of protons was proposed to be an adaptation to alkaliphilic growth conditions and an atp synthase driven by na+ is the hallmark of such an adaptation. nab. magadii had a cluster of eight genes that form the atphikecfab operon encoding putative atp synthase subunits  and an unlinked atpd homolog . similar gene clusters were found in several halophilic archaea. ion specificity of the atp synthase is determined by the c-ring, which is encoded by the atpk gene  for a-type atp synthases. nab. magadii may have a proton-driven atp synthase since its predicted atpk lacks the sequence signature of na+-dependent atp synthases  <cit> . instead, within the ion-determining region of atpk, the sequence  is identical to that of the proton-driven atp synthases from hfx. volcanii <cit> , hbt. salinarum <cit> , and nmn. pharaonis <cit> .

reduction of oxygen and the associated proton-coupled electron transfer  is the primary source of energy among aerobic organisms. respiratory complexes, which include a variety of cytochromes and terminal oxidases, are essential components of this process. biochemical and comparative genomic analyses of the electron transport chain of nmn. pharaonis have revealed several novel features, including a gene encoding a type ii nadh dehydrogenase   <cit> . a homolog of np3508a in acidianus ambivalens was proposed to be involved in nadh reoxidation, feeding into the lipid-soluble quinone pool  <cit> . a homolog of np3508a was also present in nab. magadii  and several other halophilic archaea. nab. magadii also contained genes encoding a putative nuo complex , which was similar to the mitochrondrial nadh dehydrogenase . although  <dig> nuo cluster subunits were conserved among halophilic archaea and e. coli, the nuoefg subcomplex, which is involved in accepting nadh, was missing in halophilic archaea  <cit> . furthermore, involvement of a type i complex in nadh reoxidation has been ruled out in hbt. salinarum <cit> . it is speculated that reduced coenzyme f <dig>  which is similar to nadh in its redox potential, may interact with the nuo complex in halophilic archaea. in addition to the nadh dehydrogenases, nab. magadii and other halophilic archaea are predicted to encode a succinate dehydrogenase that may oxidize succinate and reduce the quinone pool of the electron transport chain.

a number of cytochromes involved in respiratory electron transport have been characterized among the archaea  <cit> . terminal oxidases, also known as oxygen reductases, can accept electrons from a variety of donors and reduce dioxygen to water. the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained loci encoding putative cytochrome c-type terminal oxidase subunits i and ii  and cytochrome ubiquinol oxidase subunits i and ii . furthermore, pnmag <dig> contained an operon encoding putative cytochrome ubiquinol oxidase subunits i and ii  that were related to the proteins encoded by nmag_1036- <dig> . the homologs of nmag_0263- <dig> and nmag_1036- <dig> were present in htg. turkmenica , but not in nmn. pharaonis. two cbadbac operons  encoding putative cytochrome ba <dig> terminal oxidase complexes were identified in pnmag <dig> , and these operons appeared to be related to each other . the homologs of these orfs were present in htg. turkmenica  and nmn. pharaonis , the latter of which have been functionally characterized  <cit> . halocyanins are predicted to act as one-electron carriers to the terminal oxidases in halophilic archaea  <cit> . this prediction is supported by the observation that cbad is fused to halocyanin in hbt. salinarum and har. marismortui <cit> . nab. magadii contained several genes encoding putative halocyanin-like proteins . halocyanins are coupled to the reduced quinone pool by the cytochrome bc <dig> complex. although genes encoding a cytochrome bc <dig> complex are present in hbt. salinarumhfx. volcanii, and several other halophilic archaea, they were absent in htg. turkmenicanmn. pharaonis, and nab. magadii. the electron transfer from the reduced lipid-soluble quinone pool to halocyanin remains unresolved in species that lack a cytochrome bc <dig> complex. based on genome comparisons, it appeared that the respiratory chain of nab. magadii was more similar to that of htg. turkmenica than to nmn. pharaonis.

other genes encoding putative cytochrome-related proteins in the large chromosome of nab. magadii included nmag_ <dig> , nmag_ <dig> , and nmag_ <dig> . the small chromosome pnmag <dig> contained a gene encoding a putative cytochrome c biogenesis protein  that had 64% identity to the protein encoded by nmag_ <dig>  nab. magadii also contained genes  encoding a putative sulfur utilization factor  system, which was shown to be important for fe-s cluster biogenesis during stress in e. coli <cit> . other genes predicted to participate in bioenergetic conversion in nab. magadii include those encoding electron transfer flavoprotein subunits , sco1/senc electron transport proteins , and a redoxin domain protein .

signal transduction, motility, and transcriptional regulation
two-component signal transduction systems consisting of a histidine kinase  and a response regulator  constitute one of the most frequently encountered bacterial and archaeal communication circuits  <cit> . nab. magadii contained a pair of genes  encoding putative hk-rr proteins. nab. magadii also contained two pairs of genes  encoding putative hk-rr proteins with an additional rr domain in the n-terminus of the predicted hk protein. furthermore, another set of genes  encoding a hk-like protein, which was distantly related to chea of nmn. pharaonis, and a putative protein containing a rr domain was also predicted in nab. magadii. interestingly, nab. magadii also contained  <dig> genes encoding putative hk proteins without a cognate rr gene  and  <dig> genes encoding putative rr proteins without a cognate hk gene .

halobacterial perception of and response to physical stimulus such as light  is mediated by photoreceptors  <cit> . the genome of nab. magadii contained a single rhodopsin gene . nab. magadii also contained  <dig> genes  encoding distant homologs of rhodopsins that were related to each other . they were also related to np1758a from nmn. pharaonis  and predicted to encode distant rhodopsin homologs that lack the lys residue involved in covalent retinal attachment. whether these rhodopsin homologs interact with retinal noncovalently, or if they interact with retinal at all, is unknown. two of the three genes encoding retinal homologs in nab. magadii  were located adjacent to genes  encoding putative methyl-accepting chemotactic transducer proteins. in nmn. pharaonis, np1758a and np3132a, which are homologs of nmag_ <dig> and  <dig>  were also found adjacent to genes  encoding putative methyl-accepting chemotactic transducer proteins  <cit> . therefore, this group of distant rhodopsin homologs may be involved in perception of external stimuli, although it remains to be determined if they are involved in light perception. although htg. turkmenica lacked genes encoding bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin, it contained a single gene  that appeared to be a distant homolog of nmag_ <dig> and  <dig>  furthermore, similar to nmn. pharaonisnab. magadii lacked a gene encoding a proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. however, nab. magadii contained a locus encoding putative phytoene desaturase, ubia prenyltransferase, carotene biosynthesis protein, and phytoene synthase  as well as a gene encoding a putative squalene/phytoene synthase .

two unrelated enzyme families are used for the cleavage of β-carotene into retinal in halophilic archaea. distant paralogs, which belong to one of these β-carotenase enzyme families, have been identified in hbt. salinarum and designated brp and blh  <cit> . although homologs of brp and blh were present in nmn. pharaonis , they were absent in nab. magadii. however, nab. magadii contained a homolog  of hqr. walsbyi hq2020a, which was predicted to encode a distinct β-carotenase unrelated to those mentioned above  <cit> . interestingly, htg. turkmenica lacked homologs of brp and blh as well as hq2020a, which is consistent with the absence of all canonical rhodopsins in this organism.

microbial response to chemical stimulus  is mediated by chemoreceptors  <cit> . the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained two loci encoding putative motility and signal transduction functions. one of them contained exclusively “che genes” in a cheybaccdr operon , which is preceded by two divergently transcribed and distantly related chew genes . the cheybaccdr operon encodes a very long signal transduction histidine kinase , a response regulator receiver protein , a cher-type mcp methyltransferase, and a response regulator receiver-modulated methylesterase . while ched has been reported to function as glutamine deamidase in some organisms or as methylesterase in others, cheb functions as both  <cit> . a similar locus was also present in htg. turkmenica  and based on predicted protein homology, it appeared that the two loci were evolutionarily very closely linked. highly similar gene clusters were also found in the genomes of halopiger xanaduensisnatrinema pellirubrum, and natronobacterium gregoryi. the second locus  contained “che genes” along with “fla genes” encoding flagellin biosynthesis and assembly functions . the “che genes” in this locus encode putative chea, chey, cher, cheb, ched, a two-domain chec, and two chew proteins. nab. magadii contained two chef genes within this locus and homologs of these genes were shown to be involved in chemotaxis in halobacterium <cit> . this gene cluster also encoded three methyl-accepting chemotaxis sensory transducers , two of which were adjacent to genes encoding distant rhodopsin homologs . other genes encoding putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis sensory transducers in nab. magadii include nmag_ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 3856). among these, two  were adjacent to genes encoding periplasmic ligand-binding proteins.

archaeal flagella are very different in composition and assembly in comparison to bacterial flagella  <cit> . in contrast to the bacterial flagellar motor, which is driven by an ion gradient, the archaeal flagellar motor is driven by atp, as shown in hbt. salinarum <cit> . within the second motility and signal transduction gene cluster  of nab. magadii is a region  with  <dig> predicted orfs encoding putative flagellin biosynthesis and assembly proteins . except nmag_ <dig>  which encoded a protein of unknown function, all other orfs were located on the plus strand. this region contains  <dig> flagellin genes , which encode the flagella proteins previously identified  <cit>  and characterized  <cit> . furthermore, nab. magadii contained homologs of flaf , flag , flah , flai , and flaj . the latter two genes  encode putative proteins homologous to the type ii secretion system proteins e and f, respectively. in several archaea, flai has been shown to be involved in flagellin assembly  <cit> , and was recently proposed as a motor component  <cit> . the motility gene clusters of halophilic archaea are generally polymorphic, probably due to divergence of genome organization and deletion/duplication of the accessory genes  <cit> . nevertheless, flahflai, and flaj represent a core set of highly conserved genes presumably crucial for archaeal motility.

since previous electron microscopic analyses have demonstrated that nab. magadii contains distinctive flagella  <cit> , and structures resembling flagella are also visible in the tem images in figure  <dig>  it is likely that the fla locus  of nab. magadii was involved in flagellin biosynthesis and motility. in addition, the large chromosome of nab. magadii contained genes encoding a putative full-length pilt protein  and a prepilin peptidase , whose homologs were found in nmn. pharaonis  and htg. turkmenica .

archaeal basal transcription machinery has many similarities to the eukaryotic rna polymerase ii apparatus. however, the mechanisms of transcription regulation and the transcriptional regulators among archaea are distinct from those of eukaryotes  <cit> . nab. magadii contained  <dig> genes  encoding putative transcriptional regulators . blastp analyses indicated that most of these predicted proteins were related to bacterial trs. these trs were categorized into the following families based on their helix-turn-helix  motifs : asnc , iclr , padr , arsr/gntr/fur , xre , trmb , abrb , tetr , marr , copg/arc/metj/nikr , hxlr , tena , mode , and unassigned . apart from these trs, nab. magadii also contained  <dig> genes encoding trs with an hth- <dig> domain, which was also found in bacterio-opsin activators . in addition, nab. magadii encoded a two-domain archaeal histone , a single tata-binding transcription initiation factor , a single transcription initiation factor tfe , and a set of seven transcription initiation factors tfb .

CONCLUSIONS
this report describes the genome sequence of nab. magadii, a haloalkaliphilic archaeon that belongs to a physiologically distinct subgroup of halophilic archaea. although nab. magadii appears to have developed strategies similar to nmn. pharaonis to optimally thrive in low water activity and high ph habitats, the genetic architecture of nab. magadii is more similar to that of htg. turkmenica than to nmn. pharaonis. the presence of genes encoding the biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant 2-sulfotrehalose is an uncommon feature among halophilic archaea and this may have contributed to the evolution of nab. magadii in its natural environment. nab. magadii has genes encoding a number of cation/proton antiporters as well as pathways for the biosynthesis and/or transport of various cofactors and vitamins. the occurrence of genes encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycerol utilization suggests that nab. magadii is metabolically versatile and can use different carbon and energy sources to sustain growth. furthermore, the large repertoire of genes encoding putative proteases/peptidases and peptide transport systems is indicative of the protein/peptide catabolic potential of nab. magadii. it also appears that nab. magadii can perceive and process physical and chemical stimuli, and respond appropriately by moving toward or away from those stimuli using the flagellar apparatus. the information obtained from this comparative genomic analysis contributes to our overall understanding of the biology and diversity of halophilic archaea. in particular, it will guide current and future research on the genetics and physiology of nab. magadii. such studies are expected to facilitate the manipulation of this archaeon as a model for haloalkalphilic metabolism and its optimization for biotechnological applications.
