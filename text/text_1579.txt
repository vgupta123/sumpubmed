BACKGROUND
copper is widely distributed in nature and it is often found in the earth’s crust. cu is an essential trace element for living organism, playing a role in an important number of biological processes  <cit> . the properties of the metallic form of copper, such as its electricity and heat conductivity, resistance to corrosion, malleability and ductility, have been useful for a wide variety of applications. elevated levels of cu from natural and industrial sources have been reported in several cu-producing countries such as chile, china, indonesia, russia, zambia, and australia  <cit> . the mining activities and the use of pesticides to control plant diseases have increased the cu levels in agricultural soils. cu could bind to soil components  leading a significant accumulation in the soil surface  <cit> . soil bacteria are responsible for diverse ecological processes, such as biochemical cycling of the elements, plant growth, decomposition of organic matter, maintenance of soil structure, detoxification and pest control  <cit> . cu accumulation could induce harmful effects on soil bacteria damaging the biological processes and the soil quality  <cit> .

culture independent molecular techniques such as dgge have been used to study microbial communities. dgge is based on an amplification step with specific primers to amplify a specific gene  and a denaturing gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. studies of soil bacterial community by dgge revealed that heavy metal contamination in agricultural soils close to copper and zinc smelters may provoke changes in the composition of soil bacterial community and a decrease of the bacterial diversity  <cit> . however, changes in the soil bacterial community exposed to heavy metal may vary depending of soil properties, heavy metal bioavailability and the indigenous microbial groups in soil  <cit> .

the genes conferring copper resistance in bacteria are often present in plasmids and organized in an operon  <cit> . the copper resistance is encoded by the cop genes  in cupriavidus metallidurans ch <dig>  pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato pt <dig>  xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria e3c <dig> and pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig> and by the pco genes  in escherichia coli strain rj <dig>  <cit> . the copa gene encoding a multi-copper oxidase  is one of the main genetic determinants involved in cu-resistance in gram-negative bacteria. it encodes the multi-copper oxidase that oxidase cu to the less toxic chemical form of cu  <cit> . a different copa gene that encodes a cu-transporting p-type atpase involved in cu homeostasis has been described in e. coli and other bacteria  <cit> . the copa gene encoding a multi-copper oxidase is widely present in cu-resistant bacterial strains and may represent a relevant marker to study the cu-resistance in bacteria  <cit> . the aims of this study were to investigate the effect of long-term cu pollution on the bacterial community and the characterization of cu-resistant bacteria from agricultural sites located close to copper smelters from the aconcagua valley, central chile.

RESULTS
the bacterial communities of three cu-polluted agricultural soils and one non-polluted soil from valparaíso region, central chile, were characterized. the three polluted agricultural sites from aconcagua valley are located close to an active or an abandoned cu smelter. an agricultural soil located far away from mining activities in casablanca valley was selected as a non-polluted site. soils from aconcagua valley  and from casablanca valley  were neutral. soils from south chagres and Ñilhue showed higher organic matter content  than soils from north chagres and la vinilla . the total cu concentrations of the aconcagua valley soils ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> mg kg- <dig>  whereas the total cu concentration in the la vinilla soil was only  <dig> mg kg- <dig>  the exchangeable cu concentration of the north and south chagres soils was  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg kg- <dig>  respectively, and  <dig>  mg kg- <dig> for the Ñilhue soil. the exchangeable cu concentration observed in the la vinilla soil was below the detection limit . the total concentrations of zn , pb  and cr  in cu-polluted soils from aconcagua valley were high, whereas in la vinilla soil heavy metals were present at low concentration.

bacterial community profiling in agricultural soils by dgge
dgge from the four soils showed complex profiles suggesting a high diversity of the bacterial community in cu-polluted and non-polluted soils . upgma analysis of banding patterns from bacterial dgge profiles of the four agricultural sites were grouped into four clusters . replicates from each agricultural soil showed a very high similarity . soils from south chagres, Ñilhue and north chagres showed a high similarity . the non-polluted la vinilla soil showed a similarity of 73% with the cu-polluted soils . the values of shannon index obtained for each soil were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for north chagres,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for south chagres,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for Ñilhue and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for la vinilla. the richness values  obtained for each soil were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for north chagres,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for south chagres,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for Ñilhue and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for la vinilla .

pcr detection of cu-resistance genes in metagenomic dna from agricultural soils
the presence of the copa gene in the metagenomic dna from the four agricultural soils was studied. the copa gene was detected by pcr in the three cu-polluted soils from aconcagua valley . in contrast, the copa gene was not detected in the non-polluted soil from casablanca valley.

copper tolerance of bacterial community
the cu-tolerance of the bacterial community of the agricultural soils was determined. the cultivable heterotrophic bacteria ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu g-1d.w.s in cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. the cu-tolerant culti-vable bacteria ranged from  <dig> to 23%  of the total cultivable heterotrophic bacteria in cu-polluted agricultural soils from aconcagua valley. in the non-polluted soil from la vinilla, the cu-tolerant bacteria were  <dig> % . the number of cu-tolerant cultivable bacteria was significantly larger in cu-polluted soils than in non-polluted soil . the highest frequency of cu-tolerant bacteria was found in the cu-polluted soil of south chagres, which is the soil with the highest cu content, while the lowest rate was found in the non-polluted soil from la vinilla. these results revealed that cu-tolerant cultivable bacteria in cu-polluted soils were approximately  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher than in the non-polluted soil .

characterization of cu-resistant bacterial isolates
cu-resistant bacteria were isolated from the three cu-polluted soils from the aconcagua valley. a representative collection of  <dig> bacterial strains  were isolated by enrichment in r2a medium containing cu2+ . the soil bacteria isolated were challenged with successive cu2+ concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm in lptms medium. a marked decrease in the cells number was observed in the medium containing cu2+ . eleven bacteria that were capable of growing in the presence of cu2+  were selected from the  <dig> isolates for further studies. two bacterial strains isolated from Ñilhue were capable of tolerate  <dig>  mm of cu2+. three isolates from south chagres tolerate  <dig>  mm of cu2+. six strains from north chagres were capable of tolerate  <dig>  mm of cu2+. the cu-resistant isolates were challenged to heavy metals for the determination of the mic values. five of the eleven cu-resistant strains isolated  showed also tolerance to co2+, ni2+, zn2+, hg2+ and cro42- . these five broad-range heavy metal resistant bacteria should possess diverse mechanisms for heavy metal resistance. therefore, these isolates were selected for further characterization. strains that were capable to grow in presence of  <dig>  mm of cu2+, co2+, ni2+, zn2+ or cro42- and  <dig>  mm of hg2+ were recorded as tolerant. strain o <dig> showed a high mic to cu2+ , co2+ , ni2+ , zn2+  and hg2+ . strain a <dig> and a <dig> showed a high mic to cu2+ , co2+ , ni2+ , zn2+  and hg2+ . strain o <dig> showed a high mic to cu2+ , cro42- , co2+ , and ni2+ . strain c <dig> showed a high mic to cu2+ , cro42-  and co2+ . all the strains had a low mic to cd2+ , indicating that these strains were not resistant to this heavy metal.

identification of cu-resistant isolates
for bacterial identification, comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analyses of the bacterial isolates were used. the results indicated that isolates o <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> belong to the sphingomonas genus, showing a high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity  to sphingomonas paucimobilis. isolate c <dig> was identified as a stenotrophomonas strain, showing a high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity  to stenotrophomonas maltophilia. isolate o <dig> was identified as an arthrobacter strain, with high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity  to arthrobacter oxydans. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the isolates and other bacteria including strains from stenotrophomonas, sphingomonas and arthrobacter genera were used to build a phylogenetic tree . strains o <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are closely related to sphingomonas paucimobilis strain os- <dig> a. strain c <dig> is closely related with stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains hr <dig> and d <dig>  strain o <dig> is closely related with the gram-positive bacteria arthrobacter oxydans wa4- <dig> and arthrobacter oxydans ea6- <dig> .

pcr detection of heavy metal determinants in genomic dna from bacterial isolates
the presence of the copa gene encoding a multi-copper oxidase in the bacterial isolates was studied by pcr using the coprun primers. the bacterial strains o <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and o <dig> possess the copa genes. the pcr products varied between 1000– <dig> bp. the copa protein sequences were aligned with copa sequences belonging to cu-resistant bacteria and were used to construct a phylogenetic tree . sequence analyses indicate that the copa genes of the isolates encode multi-copper oxidases that are involved in cu resistance but that are not associated to degradation of phenolic compounds or polymers. the copa protein of sphingomonas sp. strains o <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are closely related to copa of other α-proteobacteria, sharing high similarity  with copa from sphingomonas sp. s <dig>  the copa from stenotrophomonas sp. strain c <dig> belongs to the stenotrophomonas and xanthomonas copa branch of the γ-proteobacteria and is closely related to copa from stenotrophomonas maltophilia r551- <dig> . the copa of strain arthrobacter sp. o <dig> is closely related to the copa of actinobacteria and possess a 68% similarity with copa from arthrobacter sp. strain fb <dig> 

other heavy metal determinants were studied by pcr using specific primers for mera , merb  and chrb  genes based on c. metallidurans ch <dig> sequences. using these specific primers, the mera, merb and chrb genes were not detected in the five cu-resistant bacterial strains.

sphingomonas sp. strain o <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig> and stenotrophomonas sp. strain c <dig> possessed plasmids . plasmids were no detected in arthrobacter sp. strain o <dig>  the plasmids of these four bacterial isolates contained the copa gene encoding a multi-copper oxidase .

discussion
in this report, the bacterial communities in long-term cu-polluted agricultural soils from aconcagua valley, central chile, were studied and compared with the bacterial community of a non-polluted agricultural soil. the bacterial dgge profiles showed high similarity  among cu-contaminated soils suggesting a low variation in the dominant bacterial groups in these soils. a similar number of bands and banding pattern was observed by dgge fingerprints in polluted and non-polluted soils. despite of the difference in the cu content in soils, dgge studies presented a similar shannon diversity index  and richness suggesting that the presence of high copper concentration and differences in other soil properties did not affect the diversity of the dominant groups of the bacterial communities detected by dgge. these results are in agreement with a previous report of soils from abandoned cu mines from south australia that show a low impact of cu on the dominant microbial diversity  <cit> . probably, bacterial communities from long-term cu-polluted soils are well adapted to the high cu content. short-term cu pollution in soil induces significant modifications in bacterial community structure, but these changes were resilient after a few weeks or months  <cit> . our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that cu, pb and zn did not change significantly the bacterial diversity after long-term contamination  <cit> .

the copa gene that encodes for the multi-copper oxidase is one of the main genetic determinants involved in cu-resistance  <cit> . in this report, the presence of copa gene was studied in metagenomic dna from agricultural soils. the copa gene was detected in the three cu-polluted soils. in contrast, the copa gene was not detected in metagenomic dna from soils with low cu content. the number of heterotrophic cultivable bacteria was constant in all agricultural soils, whereas, the number of cu-resistant heterotrophic bacteria was significantly higher in cu-polluted soils than in the non-polluted soil. these results suggest that the presence of high levels of cu in aconcagua valley soils is exerting a selective pressure on the bacterial communities, which favors the selection of cu-tolerant bacteria.

cu-tolerant bacteria were isolated from the cu-polluted agricultural soils. most of bacterial isolates were not capable to grow in lptms medium supplemented with cu2+ . our results are consistent with a previous study that indicates that the number of resistant bacteria decreased at higher cu2+ concentration  <cit> . five isolates, sphingomonas sp. strain o <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  stenotrophomonas sp. strain c <dig> and arthrobacter sp. strain o <dig>  were resistant to high cu2+ concentration  and other heavy metals. bacteria that tolerate cu concentrations higher than  <dig> mm should possess an effective resistance system for cu detoxification. the isolates sphingomonas sp. strain o <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig> and sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  showed a high mic to cu2+ , co2+ , ni2+ , zn2+  and hg2+  . the mic of the heavy metal resistant bacterium c. metallidurans strain msr <dig> to cu2+, co2+, ni2+, zn2+ and hg2+ is  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  mm, respectively. stenotrophomonas sp. strain c <dig> and arthrobacter sp. strain o <dig> showed a high mic to cu2+  and cro42- . c. metallidurans strain msr <dig> has a mic to cro42- of  <dig>  mm. these high levels of heavy metal resistances may be useful for surviving and adapting to acute heavy metal contamination events in the soil. the mechanisms involved in heavy metal resistance of the strains isolated should be studied. sphingomonas macrogoltabidus strain s1n isolated from rhizosphere of alyssum murale, showed a high mic to cu2+  and ni2+   <cit> . stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain sm <dig> isolated from a contaminated culture, showed high mic to cu2+ , ni2+ , zn2+ , and hg2+   <cit> . arthrobacter sp. strain e <dig> isolated from a battery-manufacturing contaminated site, showed a high mic to cu2+ , co2+ , zn2+  and hg2+   <cit> . arthrobacter sp. strain s <dig> isolated from rhizosphere of alyssum murale, showed a high mic to cu2+ , co2+ , ni2+ , zn2+  and hg2+   <cit> .

the high level of heavy metal resistance of sphingomonas sp. strain o <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  stenotrophomonas sp. strain c <dig> and arthrobacter sp. strain o <dig> suggests that these strains possess diverse heavy metal determinants. the use of specific primers based on heavy metal determinants from c. metallidurans strain msr <dig> did not yield amplicons. in future studies, the presence of heavy metal resistance genes will be studied using more general primers.

in this study, the presence of multi-copper oxidase gene was evaluated in the five isolates using degenerated primers designed for copa sequences from proteobacteria. the presence of multi-copper oxidase copa genes in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria was determined. the presence of copa gene in both bacterial groups suggests that the cop system involved in cu-resistance could be widespread in soil probably through horizontal genes transfer among soil bacteria. the sequence analysis indicates that the copa proteins from sphingomonas isolates , stenotrophomonas strain  and arthrobacter strain  are closely related to copa from sphingomonas, stenotrophomonas and arthrobacter strains, respectively. the copa genes of the fives isolates encode multi-copper oxidases that oxidize cu to cu but not phenolic compounds or polymers as other multi-copper oxidases reported  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences indicate that the isolates belong to sphingomonas, stenotrophomonas and arthrobacter genera. the phylogenetic tree obtained from the sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene was similar to those results predicted from the sequence analysis of copa protein , showing a high concordance between structural and functional genes.

mobile genetic elements  could be involved in the spreading of cu resistance determinants, facilitating the adaptation of bacterial communities to copper  <cit> . bacteria exposed to copper for a long period of time may acquire mge such as plasmids carrying copper determinants and, therefore, they become copper-resistant bacteria  <cit> . in agreement with this hypothesis, this study showed the presence of the copa gene in metagenomic dna from the three cu-polluted soils and the absence of copa gene in metagenomic dna from the non-polluted soil. this study demonstrates that gram-negative cu-resistant strains isolated from long-term cu-contaminated soils carried plasmid with cu-resistance determinants. the presence of plasmids encoding copa genes in sphingomonas sp. strain o <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig>  sphingomonas sp. strain a <dig> and stenotrophomonas sp. c <dig>  confirm that mge are involved in copper resistance in these isolates. the copa  genes encoding multi-copper oxidases have been characterized in plasmids such as ppt23d, prj <dig> and pmol <dig> from escherichia coli rj <dig>  pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato pt <dig> and cupriavidus metallidurans ch <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the multi-copper oxidase copa gene was present in the genome of the gram-positive bacterium arthrobacter sp. o <dig>  but plasmids were not detected in this strain. the copa protein sequence from arthrobacter sp. o <dig> possesses a high similarity  with the multi-copper oxidase gene of arthrobacter sp. fb <dig>  which is located in a plasmid  <cit> . as plasmid isolation in some bacterial strains is difficult, the presence of the copa gene from arthrobacter sp. o <dig> in a plasmid could not be excluded.

CONCLUSIONS
this study have shown that the bacterial community diversity of agricultural soil of central chile analyzed by dgge was similar in cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. the copa gene encoding multi-copper oxidase was detected only in metagenomic dna of cu-polluted soils suggesting that copa genes are widely spread in contaminated environments. cu-resistant bacteria were isolated from these long-term polluted soils. the mic studies on bacterial isolates indicated that cu-resistant bacteria were also resistant to other heavy metal such as ni2+, hg2+ and cro42-. the copa gene was detected in the cu-resistant sphingomonas, stenotrophomonas and arthrobacter strains isolated from the polluted agricultural soils. the multi-copper oxidase copa gene is located in plasmids in the four sphingomonas and stenotrophomonas strains suggesting that mges may spread cu-resistance determinants in these soils. this study contributes to the understanding of the effect of long-term cu-pollution on the bacterial community of agricultural soils and to the characterization of novel cu-resistant bacterial isolates from agricultural soils from the aconcagua valley.
