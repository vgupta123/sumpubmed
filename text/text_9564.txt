BACKGROUND
in japan, the asiatic black bear  is classified as the subspecies . the japanese black bear currently inhabits two main islands in japan, honshu and shikoku. historically, these bears were also distributed in kyushu, but no native bears have been captured there for several decades  <cit> . however, there have been several reports of sightings of an animal believed to be a black bear in kyushu  <cit> . research on the genetic diversity in the black bear has begun in recent years and has been developed with the use of genetic markers such as mitochondrial dna  sequences and microsatellites  <cit> . using mtdna markers we have found that the japanese black bear is genetically quite distinct from other asiatic black bears  <cit> . sequences of the mtdna control region indicated that the japanese black bear could be divided genetically into three groups: western, eastern, and shikoku/kii-hanto populations  <cit> . analyses of mtdna and microsatellite markers  <cit>  revealed lower genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation in the western population than in the other populations. in fact, in most of the management units in western japan the species has been designated as “endangered” in the red data book of japan  <cit>  because of the fragmentation and isolation of their habitats.

the major histocompatibility complex  genes play an important role in the resistance to various pathogens, especially in wild animals. if mhc polymorphism declines, resistance to infectious diseases will decrease  <cit> . the mhc genes are thought to influence the survival of species or populations against pathogens. therefore, mhc genetic variability in local populations is regarded as a potentially important index in conservation genetics.

in the human genome, the mhc region is located on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> at 6p <dig>  and covers roughly  <dig> mbp comprising  <dig> genes  <cit> . the human mhc region encodes at least three functionally and structurally different types of molecules, class i, class ii, and class iii. the mhc class ii region is composed of five sub-regions . each sub-region contains at least one set of a and b genes, and these encode two polypeptide chains, α and β chains, respectively, which make up a heterodimeric molecule. for example, in a dq molecule, the dqa gene encodes the α-chain, while dqb encodes the β-chain. the dp, dq, and dr molecules are primarily important for the presentation of peptides and they are classified as classical class ii molecules.

for the last three decades, studies of mhc allele variations have been performed not only in humans and laboratory animals but also in populations of wild mammals. many such studies of wild mammals have demonstrated a relationship between low levels of mhc diversity and decreases in species population fitness . mhc diversity was examined in pinniped species, which are believed to be closely related phylogenetically to ursine species  <cit> . hoelzel and colleagues  <cit>  reported that genetic variation at the dqb locus in the southern elephant seal  did not appear to be low, whereas the northern elephant seal , which was thought to have experienced a severe population bottleneck, exhibited much less variation at this locus. lento et al.  <cit>  and weber et al.  <cit>  demonstrated low genetic diversities at the mhc loci in the new zealand sea lion , and the northern elephant seal. the census sizes of these pinniped species have also diminished in the recent past probably due to human activity. in the case of non-carnivore mammals, heterozygosity of the drb gene in a population of the striped mouse , has been shown to influence infection status  <cit> . a low level of diversity at the dab locus  in the western barred bandicoot  may influence its vulnerability against novel pathogens  <cit> .

many studies have revealed a correlation between mhc diversity and resistance against infectious disease; however, others have demonstrated that this is not the case universally. for example, genetic variation in dq and dr sequences in california sea lions , which is a thriving species, is lower than that in several other mammalian species  <cit> . the tasmanian devil , which is an endangered species, has low mhc diversity, but individuals with restricted mhc repertoires  may be resistant to the devil facial tumor disease  <cit> . however, their mhc variants were not assigned to loci because of a lack of genomic information. thereafter, the research group has shown that there is no direct evidence that mhc genetic difference between tumor-free and infected animals is associated with the resistance against the infection although certain genotypes at two mhc-linked microsatellite markers seem to be more frequently detected from healthy animals  <cit> . the drb locus in the mountain goat  exhibited low genetic diversity, but this does not appear to have affected the resistance to infectious diseases in this species  <cit> .

for ursidae, studies of mhc diversity are somewhat limited. in the giant panda , mhc studies are relatively advanced and have been used to propose some possible implications for captive management  <cit> . low genetic diversity at the aimedrb and aimedqa loci has been observed in the giant panda  <cit> . wan et al.  <cit>  attempted to understand the genomic structure and evolutionary history of aime-mhc genes. the study has showed that the giant panda possesses a single dyb-like pseudogene . chen et al.  <cit>  examined genetic diversity at seven aime-mhc class ii genes from  <dig> individuals and showed the presence of two monomorphic and five polymorphic loci. in brown bears  three dqa variants and  <dig> drb variants were identified in  <dig> and  <dig> bears, respectively, although loci have not been assigned  <cit> . kuduk and colleagues reported the expression of three mhc class i, two drb, two dqb and one dqa loci in the brown bear  <cit> . other than these studies on the giant panda and brown bear, there have been no published reports on the mhc genetic diversity in the ursidae.

although the direct contribution of mhc genes to the immunological fitness of animals is still unclear, the relatively high genetic diversity of the mhc reflects the abundance in repertoire of binding peptides, derived from pathogens. we thus believe that mhc diversity potentially contributes to resistance against environmental pathogens and species survival, indicating that study of these loci is essential for designing a plan for conservation management of animals. because of large variability of mhc, the examination of mhc diversity is also useful for the management of endangered wild-animal populations that show no variation in genetic markers such as microsatellite loci  <cit> . in our previous study, we reported a functional dqb sequence  in the japanese black bear, identified using the rapid amplification of cdna ends method  <cit> . here, we investigated polymorphism in exon  <dig> of dqb that contains the hypervariable region involved in binding antigens for the japanese black bear to consider the potential implications for resistance against pathogens and estimate the status of local populations on the basis of their mhc variation.

RESULTS
features of the dqb exon  <dig> variants in the japanese black bear
the entire exon  <dig> region of the dqb locus  was determined for the japanese black bear. the amplified region corresponded to amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of the β chain of the human dr molecule  <cit> . the frequency of variant typing success was lowest for tooth samples , and was highest for blood . this result probably reflects the difference in the amount of gdna in each sample type. from  <dig> bear samples in  <dig> of  <dig> conservation and management units designed by yoneda  <cit>  , we detected  <dig> dqb variants. however, the application of criteria for genotyping used in this study  reduced the number to  <dig> variants  and to  <dig> bear samples . in the present study, no more than two different variants per individual were detected from the clones of the pcr products.

thirty-one distinct amino acid sequences  were translated from nucleotide sequences of the  <dig> variants  . because one variant examined  included a premature stop codon in the sequence, it was recognized as a pseudogene . this urth-dqb* <dig> was detected from one individual which was heterozygous with this variant and urth-dqb* <dig>  an ncbi blast search showed that sequence similarities between bear urth-dqb and panda aime-dqb variants were 84% to 91% and 93% to 96% similarity at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively  <cit> . of all the variants, urth-dqb* <dig>  * <dig>  * <dig>  * <dig>  and * <dig> correspond to the urth-dqb*a to urth-dqb*e variants detected in our previous study  <cit> , at the dna level. thus, in the present study we additionally identified  <dig> novel variants at the dna level in  <dig> samples. the nucleotide sequence of urth-dqb* <dig> was identical to that found in exon  <dig> of a cdna sequence derived from mrna of a bear sample in our previous study  <cit> . this suggests the amplification of a functional dqb locus in the present study, although there is no evidence of protein translation. deletions and insertions were not detected among the sequences. there were  <dig> segregating sites among the  <dig> different nucleotide sequences . amino acid substitutions were observed at  <dig> sites among the  <dig> allotypes . while  <dig> of these substituted sites were located in the putative peptide-binding residues   <cit> ,  <dig> corresponded to non-pbr positions. the presence of more substitution sites in the non-pbrs appears to suggest a loss of the open reading frame in the bear dqb gene. however, there were no frameshift or nonsense mutations in urth-dqb sequences with the exception of the urth-dqb* <dig> although our study was limited to exon  <dig> . in addition, amino acids at  <dig> of  <dig> pbr codons that showed a monomorphic pattern were also conserved in the human dqb <dig> locus, and most of the segregating sites at the non-pbrs among bear dqb variants were singletons. although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that pseudogenes are present in our data set, the fact that our results show more substitution sites in the non-pbrs than pbrs indicates that it is unlikely that we amplified pseudogenes. therefore, we defined all bear dqb variants as the putative functional dqb molecule with the exception of urth-dqb* <dig>  thirty-one dqb allotypes could be classified into  <dig> types of pbr . in  <dig> bears ,  <dig> of  <dig> heterozygotes possessed a combination of different types of pbr sequences.

on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the black bear dqb variants, we performed a search for intragenic recombination by using the geneconv program  <cit> . permutation testing indicated the possibility of recombination between some pairs of variants . however, the bonferroni-corrected blast-like test in geneconv indicated no significant values  for recombination events. in addition, not only the method described by satta  <cit>  but also the rdp <dig> program  <cit>  indicated no significant signals for recombination or gene conversion. thus, we used all the dqb variants of the japanese black bear for further analyses.

gene tree based on exon  <dig> sequences of ursine mhc class ii genes
a maximum likelihood  tree based on amino acid sequences of partial dqb and drb exon  <dig> from the ursidae species was constructed . in this ml tree, the dqb sequences formed a clearly separated cluster from the drb sequences, in agreement with yasukochi et al.  <cit> . these trees showed that the  <dig> sequences from the japanese black bear formed a monophyletic group with the dqbs of the giant panda. the bayesian and neighbor-joining   <cit>  trees also showed a monophyletic clade of the black bear dqbs and panda dqbs .

in the ml tree, drbs of some ursine species were mixed with each other although the orthology of their sequences was unclear, indicating a possible trans-specific mode in the drbs of ursine species. in the black bear/panda dqb clade, twenty black bear dqb allotypes  appear to cluster more closely with panda rather than other black bear dqbs, suggesting the trans-species polymorphism. however, the bootstrap value is low , and the pairwise distance among the twenty bears and other bear dqb variants showed closer relationships than those between black bear and panda dqbs. for example, the pairwise distances between the urth-dqb* <dig> and other black bear dqbs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , while those between the urth-dqb* <dig> and panda dqbs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . in addition, the bayesian tree showed that dqb sequences of japanese black bear formed a distinct clade from those of giant panda . therefore, the allelic lineage of twenty black bear dqbs and panda dqbs may be different even though the ml tree appears to show the pattern of trans-species evolution.

selection of the dqb exon  <dig> region
we estimated the mean numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions within the 267-bp region of dqb exon  <dig> variants in the japanese black bear by using a modified nei–gojobori method  <cit>  . for the black bear, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions  was approximately  <dig>  in the pbrs,  <dig>  in the non-pbrs, and  <dig>  in the entire exon  <dig> region. although three statistical tests did not indicate recombination among all the dqb variants, according to the blast-like test without the bonferroni-correction in geneconv program ,  <dig> variants were shown to have possibly undergone recombination or gene conversion. recombination would change the dn/ds value, however, even if these possible recombinants were removed, ratios of dn/ds showed slightly higher values:  <dig>  in the pbrs,  <dig>  in the non-pbrs, and  <dig>  in the entire exon  <dig> region. this shows that inclusion of the possible recombinants does not affect the result. to evaluate the dn/ds of the black bear, we compared them with those of other mammalian dqb or drb loci . in the family ursidae, the dn/ds ratio within the pbrs of dqb in the black bear was higher than that of the giant panda dqbs, while it was lower than that of brown bear drbs . compared with other mammals, the dn/ds value of the black bear did not appear to be low. in addition, by using the paml program with models that describe various selection pressures   <cit> , ratios of ω were estimated for black bears . values of ω in the black bear were significantly higher than unity  under m2a and m <dig> models that allow for balancing selection . the likelihood ratio test of hypotheses  showed statistically significant values , suggesting a balancing selection model is a better fit to the data compared to other models. thus, the present results indicate that exon  <dig> of dqb in the black bear has been a target of balancing selection. the bayesian analysis also showed that five codons were potentially under balancing selection. the mean value of ω, estimated with bayesian inference by using the omegamap program  <cit> , was also larger than unity . this analysis also suggested that  <dig> codons were probably under balancing selection. of these  <dig> codons, five were estimated by both the paml and the omegamap programs. a majority of the selected sites  were located in the predicted pbrs .

estimation of the divergence time of dqb variants in the japanese black bear
to estimate the divergence time of dqb variants in the japanese black bear, we calculated the maximum genetic distance at synonymous sites that corresponded to the time to most recent common ancestor . the resulting value was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and, by assuming  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per site per year as the average synonymous substitution rate for mammalian nuclear dna  <cit> , the divergence time of the bear dqb variants was estimated to be about  <dig> million years ago . even if the possible recombinants described above were removed, the result did not change.

geographical distribution and genetic variation in the mhc exon  <dig> variants in the conservation and management units
five dqb allotypes  were shared among the management units . in particular, urth-dqb* <dig> was observed throughout all the management units. this allotype, urth-dqb* <dig>  corresponds to six nucleotide dqb variants . the variant urth-dqb* <dig> was detected in a particularly large number  of bears. this suggests that urth-dqb* <dig> may have been dominantly maintained in the black bear population in recent times. this is probably because of its important immune role against pathogens or for demographic reasons.

on the basis of the variant frequency in each of the six management units from which more than  <dig> individuals were sampled, the expected heterozygosity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   . values of observed heterozygosity  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , which were lower than the he for all six units. this suggests non-random mating and/or population subdivision in each unit or the existence of null alleles. among the six units, he and ho were the highest in the north-central alps  unit  and the echigo-mikuni  unit , respectively, while those of western chugoku  were the lowest . in the nca unit, the ho value  was significantly low  compared with the highest he value . the observed and expected heterozygosities of bears in western japan  were lower than that of bears in eastern japan . nucleotide diversity  based on synonymous substitutions within a unit ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among the six units, and the overall value for black bears was  <dig> . the πs value of the wc unit  was the lowest among the six units.

we calculated four statistics of genetic differentiation  for pairs of management units by using the nucleotide sequences of dqb variants . among the six management units, most kst and fst values indicated statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation, including those between the wc and other units , and the gassan-asahi iide  and other units . with respect to hedrick’s g’st and jost’s d, these values trended to be high between the wc and other units. the high values of g’st and d  and significant values of kst and fst were observed only between the wc and em/nca/hakusan-okumino  units . we calculated average values for each of four statistics between management unit pairs in western and eastern japan. the results indicated that the values for western japan  were higher than those for eastern japan .

discussion
estimations of trans-species polymorphism in the dqb variants of the japanese black bear
in this study, we detected  <dig> dqb variants in  <dig> japanese black bears. these  <dig> nucleotide variants translated to give  <dig> allotypes and one putative, and the  <dig> allotypes were used to construct an ml tree to examine relationships among mhc class ii sequences of ursine species . the tree showed that the dqb sequences of the japanese black bear formed a monophyletic group with those of the giant panda. in our previous study, we reported that black bear dqb sequences cluster with dqb sequences of various mammalian species  <cit> . these results suggest that all mhc sequences of black bears are likely to have been derived from the dqb gene.

the ml tree suggested a pattern of drb trans-species evolution among ursine species, in agreement with the goda et al.  <cit>  . the estimated divergence time of black bear dqb variants was approximately  <dig> ±  <dig>  mya. previous studies have estimated that a rapid radiation of the genus ursus has occurred at around  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> . therefore, even if our estimate overestimated divergence time because of the limited number of synonymous sites, it is possible that the dqb allelic lineage of the japanese black bear was shared with other species in the genus ursus. in fact, urth-dqb* <dig> has been detected in the asiatic black bear in russia , although the pcr amplification indicating this was performed with the primer pair used in our previous study  <cit> . fossil records suggest that the ancestral japanese black bear migrated to the japanese archipelago during the middle pleistocene   <cit> . therefore, in the asiatic black bear, including the japanese black bear, the urth-dqb* <dig> lineage may have been maintained for at least  <dig>  million years .

if sequences of other ursine species are obtained in the future, it will be important to carefully distinguish orthologous genes from paralogous ones. it is possible that variants of paralogous genes can aberrantly reflect the trans-specific pattern of alleles in orthologous genes.

selective pressure on the dqb gene of the japanese black bear
to estimate whether balancing selection have acted on the dqb gene of black bears, we calculated dn/ds  ratios by using three methods: the modified nei–gojobori model, ml, and bayesian inferences. all three methods indicated that the dn/ds values were significantly higher than unity, supporting the influence of balancing selection on the dqb locus of the japanese black bear. according to the modified nei–gojobori method, the dn/ds value in the pbr was  <dig> . this value is relatively higher than those of some other mammalian species . the values of the giant panda dqb , the namibian cheetah drb , and the european mink drb  are all lower than that of the black bear. in addition, the number of mhc variants in the black bear is considerably higher than that of the three species even though the variants of the namibian cheetah may be derived from multiple loci . since these mammalian species are all designated as an endangered species in the international union for conservation of nature  red list  <cit> , the effective population sizes of these species are expected to be quite small. in theory, the effect of selective pressure decreases with diminishing the effective population size, due to a larger effect of random genetic drift  <cit> . thus, since the census population size of the japanese black bear is relatively large, , the black bear may show the higher dn/ds value, compared with other endangered species.

peptide-binding repertoires of the dqb molecules in the japanese black bear
the amino acids in the pbrs for the japanese black bear dqbs can be divided into  <dig> different types . theoretically, the average number of nonsynonymous changes within the pbrs should be equal to the number of functionally different alleles that segregate in a population  <cit> . these groups might correspond to so-called “super-types”  <cit> . a super-type is a group of alleles with a similar repertoire of peptide binding. the mean number of nonsynonymous substitution in the pbrs  of the black bear dqb was  <dig> , and this translated to an expected number of allelic lineages of approximately ten. this is slightly inconsistent with the number of different types in the pbrs in figure  <dig>  this suggests that some pbrs may be functionally similar . alternatively, since the length of dqb sequences is limited to exon  <dig> only, the resolution of the kb estimate may be lower.

effects of demographic events on the japanese black bear population
we compared results obtained from analyses of the mtdna  <cit>  and dqb genetic markers to estimate demographic events that have occurred in japanese black bear populations. mhc alleles are maintained for long periods by balancing selection  <cit> , while the coalescence times of mtdna are short because of its maternal inheritance mode and ploidy level. due to this characteristic, mtdna has a higher susceptibility to the effect of recent demographic factors. therefore, the time scales in evolutionary history represented by these two types of genetic markers are different.

the extent of sharing dqb allotypes among japanese black bear management units was higher than that of mtdna haplotypes . in particular, urth-dqb* <dig>  was frequently found throughout japan. this observation could reflect the difference in coalescence time between the two systems and a time-dependent difference in the degree of population fragmentation. alternatively, if the same dominant pathogen affects different populations , a dqb allotype that confers resistance to this pathogen is expected to be shared by different populations. on the other hand, the management unit-specific allotypes were found from most of the units. this suggests that rare allotypes also have been maintained in the japanese black bear population, possibly due to negative frequency-dependent selection  <cit> .

values of observed heterozygosity  were lower than the he for all six units. some management units showed a significant departure from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  . the excess of he appeared not to be associated with the quality of dna samples as there was no correlation between the number of homozygotes and the quality of dna samples . in addition, to examine the possibility of null alleles, we determined nucleotide sequences of the primer target region in  <dig> samples . while all individuals showed only one degenerated site in the reverse primer-annealing region,  <dig> individuals possessed seven degenerated sites in the forward primer region. in the forward primer region of the  <dig> individuals, there were two sets of nucleotide sequences that differed by less than  <dig> bp. the seven degenerated sites are derived from these two nucleotide sequences. however, the forward primer used in the present study  is designed to specifically anneal to only one particular sequence  in the primer region. therefore, the seven degenerated sites are unlikely to be the cause of null allele. this suggests that the excess of he is not caused by technical problems. since cross-locus amplification potentially decreases the possibility of the he excess , the he excess suggests that our designed primer amplifies a single dqb locus. although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of null alleles, the he excess is more likely caused by demographic events such as non-random mating and/or population subdivision in a local population.

in our previous study  <cit> , fst values for mtdna haplotypes among the management unit pairs in western japan were larger than those among the pairs in eastern japan. since mtdna haplotype distributions reflect recent demographic events, the large fst in western japan indicates a more infrequent gene flow within western japanese populations. the level of genetic differentiation at dqb among the units in western japan was also high. this increase may be due to non-random mating and genetic drift in western japan in recent history. non-random mating and genetic drift may be caused by fragmentation and isolation of habitat.

the genealogical structure of mhc alleles under strong symmetric balancing selection is similar to that of neutral genes, with the exception of a difference in time scales  <cit> . to estimate the effect of population subdivision in the japanese black bear in the distant past, we calculated the ratio of the largest genetic distance  to the mean distance  in bear dqb variants. at neutral genes, dtmrca is expected to be twice the value of d <cit> . the ratio of dtmrca to ds in the dqb variants was approximately  <dig> , suggesting an effect of population fragmentation. thus, the japanese black bear population might have been isolated and fragmented not only in the recent past but also in the relatively distant past.

genetic degradation of black bears in the wc unit
for the wc unit in western japan, values of genetic diversity, for not only the mhc dqbs  but also mtdna , were significantly lower than those for the other management units . in addition, both fst and kst values calculated between the wc unit and other units were significantly high, and also hedrick’s g’st and jost’d tended to be higher than those among the other units. this suggests that genetic drift and/or non-random mating also influence mhc diversity in the wc unit, and it implies that black bears in the wc unit might be gradually diminishing in their potential to adapt to environmental adversity, such as the presence of various pathogens. thus, even if bears in the wc unit currently have resistance against infectious disease, we need to design a conservation plan to maintain mhc diversity in the bears in this unit. the habitat area of the eastern chugoku , kii hanto , and shikoku  units in western japan are smaller than that of the wc unit. since previous studies that examined genetic diversities of black bears by using mtdna and microsatellite markers have suggested a lower level of genetic diversities in the populations of western japan  <cit> , mhc variation in these management units might be lower than that in the wc unit. therefore, it is essential to investigate mhc variation in these units further by using an increased number of samples.

the effects of natural selection and genetic drift on patterns of mhc variation
we observed significant he excess and genetic differentiation among the management units due to population fragmentation. ohnishi et al.  <cit>  examined genetic diversity of japanese black bears by using  <dig> microsatellite makers. in the previous study, the deviation of ho from he was not statistically significant in all examined local populations by using the hwe test. however, microsatellite markers that were not used in the study of ohnishi et al.  <cit>  showed such a deviation in the eastern chugoku  and wc units in western japan  <cit> . in addition, the genetic diversities within these units were similar to that of the isolated population of the brown bear  <cit> . sutton et al.  <cit>  proposed that negative frequency-dependent selection may be predominant in pre-bottlenecked populations and that greater loss of mhc diversity compared to neutral genetic diversity is accelerated because of uneven allele distributions. such skewed mhc allele frequencies can occur under negative frequency-dependent selection or joint action of this selection  <cit> . indeed, numerous mhc rare variants of the japanese black bear were observed in the present study. therefore, japanese black bears might have lost some dqb rare variants due to a bottleneck event in their evolutionary history.

comparison of two criteria for mhc genotyping
due to the possibility of pcr artifacts, criteria for mhc genotyping on the basis of partial sequences  remain a matter of debate. for instance, previous studies have identified mhc variants according to more conservative criteria: if a rare sequence is detected in one individual alone  and the sequence differs by less than  <dig> bp from a known sequence of the same pcr product, the sequence is considered to be an artifact introduced by pcr error  <cit> . although we attempted to carefully identify dqb variants, the methods might not be definitive. therefore, we compared the results of analyses between the two criteria. according to our criteria, we detected  <dig> variants from  <dig> bears. application of more conservative criteria reduced the number to  <dig> variants and to  <dig> bear samples. nevertheless, results of analyses such as estimates of dn/ds ratio, genetic differentiation among units and deviation from the hwe did not largely change even though the number of variants was different between two criteria. this suggests that our conclusion is not affected by the differences between criteria.

future studies
in this study, we detected a maximum of  <dig> variants including one putative . however, there is a possibility that some of these variants are pseudogenized , although we confirmed that the nucleotide sequence of exon  <dig> in a near full-length cdna sequence was identical to that of the urth-dqb* <dig>  <cit> . since a majority of our samples was collected from tooth, the size of amplified dna fragments was limited to the  <dig> bp of exon  <dig>  in addition, the sample size of our study was not sufficient to investigate mhc diversity in each management unit. to evaluate our results precisely, further analysis based on the sequences of the entire coding region of dqb should be performed by using more samples.

we designed two pairs of primers to amplify the bear dqb exon  <dig>  when one of these pairs  was used, three different sequences were detected from an individual by ta cloning, suggesting that at least two dqb loci were amplified. wan et al.  <cit>  have reported that the giant panda genome has three dqb loci, two functional and one non-functional. kuduk et al.  <cit>  have also confirmed expression of two dqb genes in the brown bear. the pcr results of our study suggest that the japanese black bear may also possess at least two dqb loci in the genome . it will be desirable to determine the genomic sequence across the wider mhc region in order to assure the specificity of each mhc locus in the bear genome.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we detected  <dig> mhc variants from  <dig> japanese black bears. the phylogenetic analysis suggests that their sequences are derived from the dqb loci. the value of dn/ds ratio indicates that the bear dqb variants have been maintained by balancing selection. the estimation of tmrca among their variants suggests that the dqb lineages arose before the origin of genus ursus. at least, the urth-dqb* <dig> variant has been shared between japanese and continental black bears for  <dig>  my . however, dqb genotyping for the japanese black bear showed considerably lower ho values than he values in each local population. one may hypothesize that skewed allelic distribution due to negative frequency-dependent selection and the bottleneck or population fragmentation in each management unit might accelerate loss of dqb rare variants. therefore, the results of our study imply that mhc variation in japanese black bears might have declined due to demographic events such as habitat fragmentation and isolation at the population or species level. nevertheless, dqb genetic diversity in japanese black bears appears to be relatively high compared to some other endangered mammalian species. this result suggests that for the present the japanese black bears appear to retain more potential resistance against pathogens than other endangered mammalian species. to prevent further decline of potential resistance against pathogens, a conservation policy for the japanese black bear should be designed to maintain mhc rare variants in each of management units. to achieve this objective, it is important to stop further fragmentation and isolation of bear habitats.
