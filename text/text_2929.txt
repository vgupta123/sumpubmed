BACKGROUND
among the cereal crops, barley is the species that presents the highest adaptability to a wide range of environments. it is cultivated from arctic latitudes to tropical areas, and it is grown at the highest altitudes. in tibet, nepal, ethiopia and the andes, farmers cultivate barley on mountain slopes at altitudes higher than any other cereals  <cit> .

ethiopia is probably the region of barley cultivation that presents the highest variability for climatic and edaphic conditions. it is cultivated from  <dig>  m above sea level  to over  <dig>  m a.s.l., and it has adapted to specific sets of agro-ecological and microclimatic regimes throughout the country  <cit> . landraces represent over 90% of the barley cultivated in ethiopia. in contrast to the genetic uniformity of modern cultivars, landraces show variation both between and within populations. this within-population diversity of these barley landraces might allow them to cope with environmental stresses, which is very important for achieving yield stability  <cit> . for this reason, landraces represent a very interesting model to study the processes of adaptation and for identification of genes and genomic regions that have adaptive roles in a crop species, through association mapping  <cit>  and through scanning for signatures of selection at the molecular level  <cit> .

knowledge of the population structure of ethiopian barley landraces, together with a deeper understanding of the nature and extent of their variation, is an important prerequisite for efficient conservation and use of the existing plant materials. several studies have reported a high level of genetic diversity in barley populations from ethiopia, such as those based on morphological traits  <cit> , and on biochemical data  <cit> . moreover, ethiopian barley is a precious source of genes that control important agronomic traits, such as resistance to disease  and to insect attack  <cit> , high lysine, and protein quality and content  <cit> , and malting and brewing quality  <cit> . furthermore, the great variability of environmental conditions in ethiopia that promote adaptive divergence, and the cultivation of barley in two growing seasons per year  <cit> , have probably driven the structure of variation of these landraces.

numerous studies on ethiopian barley have detected correlations between altitude and the frequency of morphological  <cit> , agronomic  <cit>  and biochemical  <cit>  traits, including pathogen resistance  <cit> . altitudinal gradients provide substantial changes in numerous environmental variables, which also include atmospheric pressure, temperature, clear-sky turbidity, uv-b radiation, and humidity. furthermore, the combined environmental changes across altitudes can influence various biological processes in plants, and can thus result in adaptive changes and constraints on the genetic diversity of plant populations. association between environmental variables and allele frequencies can be maintained by a balance between selection and gene flow  <cit> . however, in contrast to latitudinal clines, altitudinal gradients involve dramatic ecological transitions over relatively short linear distances, and so they require especially strong selection to counterbalance the homogenising effects of gene flow  <cit> . nevertheless, the interactions between drift and spatially restricted gene flow or historical patterns of colonisation  might also explain clinal variation.

the present study is based on a large collection of ethiopian barley landraces  that was established in  <dig> in the north shewa zone , from farmers who have used their own seed for generations  <cit> . the collection was obtained through visiting the same three districts  in both the meher and belg growing seasons  <cit>  . here, we have analysed the molecular diversity and genetic structure of this collection, using simple sequence repeats , while taking into account not only the environmental adaptation , but also, for the first time, the two growing seasons per year.

RESULTS
level of polymorphism
seven mapped nuclear ssrs were used to examine the levels and patterns of genetic variation of the barley landraces collected in north shewa, in the central highlands of ethiopia  <cit> . table  <dig> provides a summary of the statistics computed considering each of the two seasons , the three districts  and the three altitude classes . the same statistics were also computed for each locus, and are given in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> alleles were detected, with the number of alleles per locus  ranging from four  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig>  alleles per locus.

s, sample size; na, number of observed alleles; no, average number of observed alleles per locus; ne, effective number of alleles per locus; he, unbiased expected heterozygosity; ho, observed heterozygosity; rs, allelic richness.

the variation between seasons was not significant across any of the statistics considered , while the only significant difference among the districts  was for the allelic richness between the ankober  and tarmaber districts . for the altitude classes, more marked differences were seen . the number of alleles  and the allelic richness  of the low altitude class  were lower than those of the intermediate altitude class  and of the high altitude class . the genetic diversity  of the intermediate altitude class  was significantly higher  than that of the high altitude class .

considering the pattern of private alleles, the two seasons did not share  <dig>  out of the  <dig> ssr alleles, with each of these showing a frequency lower than 5%. the three districts showed a total of  <dig> private alleles , three of which had a frequency higher than 5%. finally, compared to seasons and districts, the altitude classes had a higher number of private alleles , four of which  had a frequency higher than 5%. moreover, the average frequency of private alleles that showed a frequency higher than 5% was  <dig>  for seasons,  <dig>  for districts, and  <dig>  for altitude classes.

the overall level of observed heterozygosity was very low . only three individuals, all located at high altitude, showed one or two heterozygous loci. overall, the average genetic diversity  in the ethiopian barley landraces was  <dig> % of the diversity found in the syrian and jordanian barley landraces . this difference was significant . a significant gap  was also seen for the number of alleles, na .

 <dig> total number of alleles and average diversity across loci  are calculated excluding the hvm <dig> locus, to allow direct comparisons with the nepalese landraces and with the modern varieties.

although it is important to consider the differences in the sample sizes, the ethiopian barley landraces showed a higher number of alleles  than seen for both the nepalese barley landraces   <cit>  and the modern varieties   <cit>  .

the divergence  estimates between the seasons, districts, and altitude classes are given in table  <dig>  the genetic differentiation between the two seasons was low for both fst  and rst , even if in contrast to rst, the fst was significantly different from zero . a slightly higher level of differentiation was seen for districts . among the altitude classes, the levels of differentiation were higher compared to seasons and districts, both for fst  and rst . the divergence  estimates between seasons, districts and altitude classes for each of the ssr loci analysed are given in additional file  <dig>  the individual ssr loci divergence  between seasons was significant for four loci , even if the values were low, and varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the bmag <dig> locus was the only one for which the divergence was higher between seasons  than among districts or altitude classes . a similar trend was seen for districts, with three low significance values ranking from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . for the altitude classes, the situation was different; indeed, all of the ssr loci were significantly differentiated among the altitude classes, with values varying from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

population structure and altitude cline of genetic variation
recently, various studies  have questioned the reliability of the structure results in cases of complex genetic structures. in particular, this debate has considered whether bayesian clustering algorithms are appropriate tools for studying genetic structures in populations with continuous variation of allele frequencies. to address this problem, the population structure analysis of our collection was carried out using two different methods: the first was the pritchard et al.  <cit>  non-spatial bayesian clustering method implemented in the structure software, version  <dig>   <cit> , and the second was based on a bayesian clustering algorithm that incorporates spatial information when identifying clusters of individuals, and was implemented in the tess software, version  <dig>   <cit> .

the plot of the average ln likelihood values over  <dig> runs for k values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> shows that the ln likelihood estimates increase progressively as k increases. thus, we used the evanno et al.  <cit>  method to provide a better estimate of the 'true' number of clusters  that characterised our sample. the highest Δk value was found at k =  <dig>  although high values of Δk were found also for k =  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  to minimise the effects of outlier runs, we also computed the Δk value considering five random re-samplings of  <dig> of the  <dig> runs for each k value. in all cases, the highest Δk corresponded to k =  <dig>  thus, hereafter, we will refer to cluster s <dig> and cluster s <dig> for the k =  <dig> populations identified by structure.

the percentages of membership , or inferred group ancestries, of the individuals in each of the two clusters were computed. one hundred and ninety-seven individuals  had a q higher than  <dig> , in  <dig> individuals , q was higher than  <dig> , and in  <dig> , it was higher than  <dig> . considering the threshold for membership of q ≥  <dig> , cluster s <dig> included  <dig> individuals, and cluster s <dig>   <dig> individuals.

when the individuals were sorted according to altitude, the structure analysis revealed a well-defined cline of variation; indeed, at low altitudes, cluster s <dig> was mainly seen, and this tended to be substituted by cluster s <dig> at high altitudes. the relationships between altitude and q for cluster s <dig> were assessed using a simple linear regression model. this regression was significant , and it was consistent within the meher  and the belg  seasons , and within the three districts  .

the second approach used for the population structure analysis was the algorithm implemented in the tess software that allows for prior spatial information when identifying clusters of individuals. this tess software allows the testing of different values of the spatial dependent parameter ; this parameter weights the relative importance given to spatial connectivities. we tested three different Ψ:  <dig>  , and  <dig>  and  <dig>  . for each Ψ value considered, we performed  <dig> runs for k from  <dig> to  <dig>  then the dic values of the  <dig> runs with the smallest dic were averaged. in plotting the average dic values versus k , we obtained an inflection point at k =  <dig>  this was the same for all of the different interaction parameter  values considered. thus the best model was obtained for k =  <dig> and the lowest dic value corresponded to Ψ =  <dig> , indicating a moderate spatial correlation between individuals. the average over  <dig> runs with the smallest dic value q was computed. we defined the six tess clusters as t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  one hundred and twenty-five individuals  were assigned to one of the six clusters with a q higher than  <dig> , with  <dig>  higher than  <dig> , and  <dig>  higher than  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the assignment results for all of the individuals when ordered according to altitude. averaging the q for the six tess clusters for the three altitude classes, we observed that the previous cline of variation along altitude identified by the structure assignment was also maintained for tess; indeed, at low altitudes, the t <dig> and t <dig> clusters were mainly present, and these tended to be substituted by the t <dig> and t <dig> clusters at high altitudes . the t <dig> cluster was mostly present at intermediate and high altitudes, while t <dig> was present in all of the altitude classes . however, the genotype assignment for t <dig> is more scattered at intermediate and high altitudes than at low altitudes . indeed, at low altitudes, this genotype assignment for t <dig> is characteristic of two populations collected during the meher season. it is important to note that the percentage of individuals that had a q to one of the six tess clusters higher than  <dig>  is highest  at low altitudes , and decreases at intermediate  and high  altitudes.

the correlation analysis using spearman's rho  for non-parametric tests showed that cluster s <dig> identified by structure was significantly correlated with tess clusters t <dig> and t <dig>  and cluster s <dig> with t <dig> and t <dig> . the step-wise multiple regression analysis showed that mainly tess clusters t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> provide a better prediction for cluster s <dig> , and t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> are the major contributors for cluster s <dig>  ; tess cluster t <dig> contributes to both of the s <dig> and s <dig> clusters identified by structure. these results are consistent with the relationships between the altitude and the q for the tess groups, which was tested by performing a simple regression analysis; indeed this relationship was highly significant  for the tess clusters t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> , significant  for t <dig>  but not significant for t <dig> .

the anova analysis revealed significant correlations between all of the loci considered and the altitude .

considering the morphological data, 82% of the character states considered and studied by tanto hadado et al.  <cit>  were significantly correlated with altitude , 79% of which had a probability lower than  <dig> ; moreover, at least one character state for each of the morphological traits considered was significantly correlated with altitude at p <  <dig>  .

morphological data from tanto hadado et al.  <cit> .

 <dig> character states with frequencies lower than  <dig>  and higher than  <dig>  are not included in the analysis.

association between morphological and molecular characterisations
to investigate the correspondence between the morphological and molecular characterisations, a contingency analysis was performed. the genetic groups defined by tess analysis were considered, and only the genotypes that were assigned to one of the groups with a q higher than  <dig>  were included in the analysis . no inference was carried out for tess cluster t <dig> because no genotypes were assigned to this group according to this threshold. the analysis was conducted considering the seven morphological traits: kernel-row number, spike density, lemma awn barbs, glume colour, lemma type, length of rachilla hair, and lemma colour  <cit> .

the results show that all of the traits except lemma awn barbs , were significantly associated with the tess genetic clusters. the association was higher for length of rachilla hairs, glume colour and spike density , followed by lemma colour , row number  and lemma type . the proportion of variance of each morphological trait explained by genetic groups  varied from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , with an average of  <dig> %. the types and frequencies of each of these seven qualitative traits in each of the tess clusters  are given in additional file  <dig> 

the relationships between the genetic groups according to morphological characterisation were assessed using a non-parametric correlation analysis  . the clusters t <dig> and t <dig>  showed the highest morphological differentiation. t <dig> included mainly six-rowed  and irregular  types, and was the only group that included two-rowed types , and it showed the highest frequency among all of the groups for the two-rowed deficient types . both the regular and deficient two-rowed types were absent in t <dig>  which included mainly irregular types . t <dig> was characterised by a high frequency of dense spike types , while t <dig> was characterised by lax types , and both of these groups showed high frequencies of intermediate spike density types . t <dig> was monomorphic for the lemma awn barbs  and glume colour  traits; in contrast, t <dig> also showed intermediate lemma awn barb types , and brown  and black  glume colour types. all of the individuals of t <dig> had short rachilla hairs, while those of t <dig> had both short  and long  rachilla hair types. finally, differences were seen also for the lemma colour trait: t <dig> was mostly represented by white types , while t <dig> was mostly represented by black types .

spatial structure and landscape analysis
mantel tests between the genetic and geographical distance matrices were significant . however, the correlation between molecular and geographical distance was about 2-fold lower than that between the molecular distances and differences in altitude , and also lower than that between geography and altitude .

the same pattern was seen for the spatial autocorrelation analysis, which showed that within a distance class of  <dig> km, positive and significant moran's i values were detected. this indicates that the proximal individuals  were more genetically similar  than expected from a random distribution . in this class, the individuals at similar altitudes within each district were compared. the degrees of correlation, however, rapidly decreased, and there were already negative moran's i values for the 10-km distance class. in this class, individuals from relatively different altitudes were mostly compared, mainly within each district. a similar situation was seen in the 20-km and 30-km distance classes. the degrees of correlation, however, tended to increase, and interestingly, positive and significant moran's i values were found for the 40-km and 50-km distance classes: when individuals of different districts but at similar altitudes  were compared, they tended to be genetically more similar than for a random distribution . this is particularly evident considering the relationships between the genetic and altitude distances; indeed, the individuals that were collected at similar altitudes showed higher similarities than those collected at different altitudes .

finally, it is important to note that based on the distribution of the collection sites, when individuals from similar altitudes were compared, they also tended to be geographically more distant. in contrast, the individuals from different altitudes were geographically closer .

spatial autocorrelation between geographical and genetic distances was also performed separately for the three altitude classes , which confirmed the previous trends seen, showing at low altitudes  a clear geographical effect , while at high altitudes , this effect disappeared, as all of the similarity values were not significantly different from random values, and thus no geographical structure was evident. a non-significant, intermediate  trend was seen at moderate altitudes .

sliding-window analysis
to test the significance of the trends seen, we grouped the individuals into different and non-overlapping altitude ranges: three for belg: b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> , and four for meher: m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> . the significance was tested between adjacent altitude ranges, using the wilcoxon signed-paired rank test and the bonferroni correction. the choice of the altitude ranges was designed to have the average altitudes more uniform between the belg  and the corresponding meher  classes . the number of individuals per altitude range varied from  <dig> to  <dig> for belg, and from  <dig> to  <dig> for meher.

considering the meher season, the diversity  showed a significant increase according to altitude, to about  <dig>  m a.s.l.. indeed, m <dig> showed a higher level of diversity than m <dig> ; although no other comparisons were significant in the meher season, a reduction at high altitudes was seen. a significant reduction of he at high altitudes was seen for the belg season  .

the allelic richness, rs, showed a marked increase from low to intermediate altitudes in the meher season , and reached a plateau at intermediate and high altitudes  . for the belg season, the trend of allelic richness resulted in a slight increase at intermediate altitudes  and a decrease at high altitudes .

the multilocus ld among our unlinked loci  decreased with altitude for the season, and interestingly, only that for the belg season reached non-significant levels in the interval between  <dig>  and  <dig>  m a.s.l. .

discussion
several studies have analysed the diversity of ethiopian barley landraces. however, along with our previous study on the same barley landrace collection that was based on morphological data  <cit> , for the first time the present study has considered an ad-hoc collection of barley landraces from ethiopia that was obtained on a single-plant basis, and that also included the two main growing seasons.

level of polymorphism in ethiopian barley landraces from north shewa
in this study, we analysed a collection of barley landraces from an area of about  <dig>  km <dig> in the central highlands of ethiopia, in north shewa. all of the seven microsatellites used for the analyses are in common with the study of russel et al.  <cit>  which included barley landraces from several different agro-ecological areas of syria and jordan, and six are also shared with the studies of both pandey et al.  <cit> , which analysed barley landraces from the highlands of nepal, and macaulay et al.  <cit> , which analysed a sample of modern barley varieties. interestingly, as the different barley samples were analysed with the same microsatellites, this has allowed us to make comparisons between the results of the present study and those obtained in these other studies. we have shown here a relevant level of genetic diversity in the ethiopian barley landrace collection, which was higher than both the nepalese barley landraces and the sample of modern varieties. the substantial amount of genetic variation detected in the present study was also in agreement with the high level of morphological diversity seen in the same sample of landrace populations by tanto hadado et al.  <cit> .

the ethiopian landraces from north shewa showed a lower genetic variation than those of the syrian and jordanian landraces. however, it is important to consider that russel et al.  <cit>  worked at a country level , with their study of barley landraces collected from several different agro-ecological areas of syria and jordan. for this reason, the level of diversity found in the much smaller area in our survey in the present study is undoubtedly remarkable.

population structure
overall, the population structure appears to be very low between seasons and geographical districts, while it is highly associated with altitude differences. indeed, we show significant, but very low, divergence  with no private alleles  between the two different planting seasons. moreover, the two seasons show very similar levels of diversity. these data are very consistent to those for the morphological traits on the same populations  <cit> , and they confirm that seed flow occurs between seasons, as was also suggested by 5% of the farmers' fields during the collection, where a sequential cultivation of barley was seen in the two seasons. in other words, barley is often planted in one season using the seeds obtained from the harvest in the previous season. a slightly higher divergence was seen between districts, with ankober having a higher diversity compared to the other two districts.

in contrast, the divergence estimators show strong effects due to altitude. in the present study, we used two different bayesian approaches  to make inferences on the population structure of our sample. structure identified two main clusters: rather than a subdivision among seasons or districts, these two clusters highlighted a clear altitudinal cline, and this tendency was maintained both within seasons and districts. even though the analysis conducted with tess identified more genetic groups , these were in line with the structure results. indeed, five tess clusters were highly associated to the two clusters identified by structure, with only one exception: tess cluster t <dig>  this indicates that the data obtained with the two different approaches are not completely redundant, with a more detailed and refined picture being provided by tess. however, independent of a clear or a less clear definition of the "real" numbers of the populations that characterised our sample of genotypes, it is important to stress that both of these tools were very useful and that they were in agreement in the defining of the major aspects of the genetic structure of these barley landrace populations. for instance, as for the structure clusters, the tess groups reflect the altitudinal cline of variation, with five of them significantly correlated with altitude. the same effect of altitude was also seen for all of the ssr loci used in the present study. moreover, most  of the character-state frequencies obtained from tanto hadado et al.  <cit>   were found to be significantly associated with altitude. thus, in line with other published works cited in the introduction, the present study has identified a strong association between altitude and genetic composition of barley landraces from ethiopia, with a clear altitudinal cline shown.

two possible evolutionary scenarios can be considered to explain the altitudinal cline of variation that we have detected here: a clinal variation might have originated by various patterns of migration, or by different selections along the geographical or environmental gradients  <cit> . the results in the present study for the spatial autocorrelation between altitude and genetic distances reflects a continuous and constant reduction in the moran i index, from positive to negative values; such a trend is characteristic of a typical strong selection gradient  <cit> . however, when there is a large difference between the immigrant and the resident gene frequencies, this trend can also be generated by a specific case of unidirectional migration  <cit> . the hypothesis of unidirectional migration in our case would be in a vertical direction, from low to high altitudes, although even if this is theoretically possible, under our conditions it is not realistic. this appears evident from the geographical structure of the collection area, with the three districts. moreover, when we analysed the correlogram related to the comparison between geographical and genetic distances, for the first distance class , there were positive moran i values that became significantly negative just between the genotypes with a distance of  <dig> km to  <dig> km, where the differences in altitude are already substantial . furthermore, the moran i values became positive only at high geographical distances, when comparisons were mainly made between genotypes at similar altitudes, but in different districts. these data confirm the hypothesis that selection for adaptation at different altitudes is the main factor that determines the clinal variation seen. this divergence between different districts but within the same altitude class is consistent with the selection hypothesis, and it is suggestive of different selection intensities at low and high altitudes. indeed, when we compared individuals at low altitude across the three districts, there was a significant and relatively high fst , while there were very low and non-significant fst values between individuals at intermediate  and high  altitudes from different districts. these data are confirmed by a separate spatial autocorrelation at different altitude classes, which shows a correlation between geographical distances and genetic distances only at low altitudes. this suggests that the homogeneous selection for adaptation to high altitudes is the major factor that explains these data, along with isolation by distance  at low altitudes. alternatively, we should consider the hypothesis of different migration patterns at low vs high altitudes: a higher level of seed flow between districts at high altitudes than at low altitudes.

in support of the role of adaptive selection in shaping the allele frequencies of our collection, we found that the two morphological traits analysed that relate to colour  are significantly associated with altitude. with their colour linked to the presence of anthocyanins, the coloured types in particular were positively related to altitude, while the white types showed a negative relationship with altitude. these anthocyanins are a subgroup of the flavonoids, for which an important role is well documented in responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses . thus, the higher presence of coloured types at high as opposed to low altitudes might be an adaptive response to the increased uv-b radiation characteristics at high altitudes.

however, even though there is a large amount of coherent evidence that suggests that selection is a crucial factor in shaping the diversity of ethiopian barley landrace populations, particularly at high elevations, selection alone is not enough to explain the diversity patterns seen. indeed, the diversity significantly increases from low to moderate altitudes , both in its richness and its expected heterozygosity. this occurred only for the meher season, because barley is grown in the belg season mainly at higher altitudes. this pattern can be explained by the increasing number of populations  and by the higher population sizes , as shown by tanto hadado et al.  <cit> . at low altitudes, the environmental conditions are more favourable on average, and many crops can be grown easily; thus the farmers tend to grow many different crops , and in general, barley tends to be cultivated in smaller plots, as compared to at higher elevations. thus, the increased diversity might be related to the greater population size of the barley landraces, which is not only related to the barley plot size increase, but also to the two seasons of barley growth per year at intermediate and high altitudes; thus, the effective number of generations per year is higher than one  <cit> . the maximum diversity is seen at moderate altitude , where due to the spring rains, the barley is grown in both seasons. when the altitude further increases, for both seasons, the diversity measured as expected heterozygosity decreases significantly with altitude, while the richness remains almost constant, even if at very high altitudes a small but significant reduction is seen. this trend is in agreement with the hypothesis of an increasing selection intensity for adaptation at high altitudes. selection is expected to increase the frequency of favourable alleles, which would reduce the expected heterozygosity, while the richness is less affected by selection, compared to the expected heterozygosity; this would be favoured by the greater population size. however, at very high altitudes, a reduction in the number of alleles is seen. thus, we explain the diversity pattern seen by the combined effects of selection and population size. while the plot  sizes constantly increase with altitude in a linear fashion, the number of fields increases up to  <dig> - <dig>  m. a.s.l., followed by a reduction at higher altitudes  <cit> . thus, the overall population size increases exponentially according to altitudes up to  <dig> - <dig>  m a.s.l., with a reduction at higher altitudes.

our interpretation is further supported by the reduction in the multilocus ld that was seen from low to high altitudes, which was even non-significant in the belg season, while at the extreme altitudes, the multilocus ld increased slightly. the reduction in the ld might also be explained by both the greater population size, which would increase the effective recombinations, and the selection, which will favour recombination that will produce novel multilocus genotypes.

the level of observed heterozygosity was very low , in agreement with the strict selfing nature of barley where the level of outcrossing is lower than 1-2%  <cit> . only three individuals, all located at high altitude, showed one or two heterozygous loci. clearly, our study does not have the power to discriminate between different altitudes for the level of heterozygosity. however, a higher level of heterozygosity at high altitude might partially explain the pattern of ld in our study, because of a higher effective recombination rate at high altitude. to test this hypothesis a further study should be conducted using a larger sampling.

CONCLUSIONS
landraces are a key component of agro-biodiversity, and they represent a crucial reservoir of genetic diversity for plant breeding. moreover, in-situ conservation of landraces can provide a number of advantages, including the potential for adaptation to environmental changes because of an ongoing evolutionary process. nevertheless, few studies have described the population structures of landraces or have analysed the roles of different evolutionary forces in the shaping of their genetic diversity. here, we show that barley landraces from ethiopia have highly variable local populations  with large within-population diversity. these landraces also appear to be locally adapted, and the major driving force that has shaped their population structure is selection for adaptation along an altitudinal gradient. moreover, our data suggest that the two-season system  and its effects on landrace population size have important roles in counterbalancing the homogenising effects of selection. our study highlights the potential of barley landraces from ethiopia as a source of useful alleles. they are also an ideal system to study the processes of adaptation and for identification of genes and genomic regions that have adaptive roles in a crop species, which can be achieved through association mapping and scanning for signatures of selection for molecular-diversity structure.
