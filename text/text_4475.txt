BACKGROUND
glutathione  is the most abundant thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells. it reacts directly with reactive oxygen species , or functions as a cofactor of antioxidant enzymes such as the glutathione peroxidases . in addition, gsh keeps sulfhydryl groups of cytosolic proteins in reduced form by maintaining thiol redox potential in cells  <cit> , and regulates cell signaling pathway in apoptosis  <cit> . the requirement for gsh and total antioxidant capacity is particularly high in brain.

brain consumes 20% of total oxygen in the body, and thus undergoes high levels of oxidative challenge. cumulative oxidative damage has been strongly implicated in neurodegeneration and neurological diseases, such as parkinson's disease , alzheimer's disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . the importance of gsh in particular has been indicated in the case of pd. among the progressive oxidative stresses that occur in the pathogenesis of pd, an characteristic is the decrease in total gsh concentrations in the substantia nigra in preclinical stages, when other biochemical changes are still undetectable  <cit> .

investigation of the consequences of intracellular gsh depletion in neuronal cell lines has relied predominantly on one of three methods. these are:  treatment with homocysteic acid  or glutamate to block the uptake of cystine, a substrate for gsh synthesis  <cit> ;  treatment with bso  <cit>  to inactivate γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate limiting enzyme in gsh synthesis, and  treatment with ethacrynic acid  <cit>  or diethyl maleate  <cit>  to react with the thiol group of gsh. the oxidative stress caused by gsh depletion further affects the status of other antioxidants. the concept of total antioxidant capacity  has been developed to assess the general antioxidant activity in biological samples without distinguishing the contribution from each individual component. measurements of tac have been intensively developed in the past  <dig> years. the principle of these methods is to evaluate the total effect of all contributing compounds in the system by one criterion, such as free radical scavenging, electron donation or protection against the oxidative damage to lipids, proteins or dna. but considering the fact that different categories of antioxidant work through different mechanisms and need specified conditions for maximal function, it is impossible to cover the activities of all antioxidants in one assay. thus multi-dimensional measurements on tac have been suggested  <cit> .

in this study, gsh was depleted by bso in ht <dig>  a neuronal cell line derived from mouse hippocampus. gsh level, tac, antioxidant enzyme activity, cell viability and gene expression were assessed.

RESULTS
intracellular total gsh level vs. cell density in culture
before depleting gsh from cells, total gsh levels in ht <dig> were monitored from pre-log phase to the end of log phase of cell growth . intracellular gsh levels decreased as cell density increased, with this effect being more dramatic as the cells entered log phase growth.

whether the decrease of gsh with cell growth is due to limited nutrient supply or to programmed regulation is not known. it has been reported that the gsh content of brain cells depends strongly on the availability of precursors for gsh  <cit> . it was also noticed that as ht <dig> cells grow denser in culture, the intracellular ros level decreased , as apparently balances with the decreased gsh concentration.

dose responses
intracellular gsh
the dose responses of ht <dig> to bso were analyzed by varying bso concentration from  <dig>  to  <dig> mm in a 15-hr treatment, and the changes of intracellular gsh level and tac were measured . treatment with  <dig>  mm bso resulted in a dramatic decrease of total gsh level to 35% of the control level. increasing the bso concentration to  <dig> mm further decreased the gsh level to 22% of control, representing an additional drop of only 13%. in comparison to  <dig>  mm of bso, increasing the concentration to  <dig> mm or higher caused significant decreases in gsh levels . this result suggests there are two pools of gsh in the cell, one easily depleted by bso, and the other more resistant to depletion. a previous study by seyfried et al.  <cit>  showed that bso treatment of pc <dig> cells was more efficient at depleting cytosolic gsh than mitochondrial gsh, indicating that the bso-sensitive and bso-resistant gsh pools in ht <dig> might localize to cytosol and mitochondria, respectively.

after  <dig> mm bso treatment for  <dig> hrs, the predominant form of glutathione was the reduced form ; only about 5% of the total glutathione was found in the oxidized form . after  <dig> hrs bso treatment, malondialdehyde  assay showed the increases of abs at  <dig> nm caused by mda formation were: control =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ;  <dig> mm bso =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ;  <dig> mm bso =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; and  <dig> mm bso =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , no increase in lipid peroxidation after the treatments was observed, indicating gsh depletion at these levels was not yet destructive to the cells.

total antioxidant capacity
three methods were employed in this study to investigate antioxidant status following bso treatment of ht <dig> cells. the cu2+-reducing ability assay  and fe3+-reducing ability assay  both measure the activity of metal ion-reducing antioxidants, but the frap assay is characterized by its low ph , thus excluding the antioxidant function of thiols. figure  <dig> shows that from  <dig>  to  <dig> mm bso treatment, the frap value had a sharp decrease from  <dig> to 32% of the control, indicating that some non-thiol antioxidants were expended to preserve the bso-resistant gsh or to cope with oxidative stress caused by the depletion of bso-sensitive gsh. in comparison to frap, the aop value showed a gradual decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> % of control through the range of bso concentrations, and this lesser decrease may be partially maintained by the bso-resistant gsh pool in the cells.

in contrast to frap and aop, the abts free radical scavenging ability  of the cells maintained at about 80% of the control level at all bso concentrations. cao et al.  <cit>  previously showed that gsh is highly reactive to abts radical. unlike the frap and aop assays, the abts assay appears to be less sensitive to the metal ion-reducing antioxidants that were consumed by gsh depletion.

cell viabilities and bioreduction activity
cell viabilities
effects of gsh depletion on cell viability were assayed using the mtt -based cell viability assay, an indicator of mitochondrial activity . ht <dig> cells at higher density  were more resistant to gsh depletion, and in spite of the change in bso concentration, the decrease in cell viability remained at about 10% of control. lower cell density  rendered higher sensitivity; as bso concentration increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> mm, the viability dropped from  <dig> to 50% of control. at  <dig> and  <dig> mm bso concentrations, the differences caused by cell density are significant . these results show that the mitochondrial activity of cells is influenced by gsh depletion, and that this effect is sensitive to the density of cells in culture. the reason behind the cell density factor is not clear. either proliferation status or communication between cells may contribute. in neurodegenerative diseases, the effect of cell death, thus the decrease of cell density, on the susceptibility of neurons to gsh depletion will be worth investigating. wither sever cell death can accelerate gsh loss is not known.

no changes in cell viability in response to bso treatment were detected by trypan blue staining, which distinguishes dead cells from live ones. cell viabilities were  <dig> %  for untreated cells, and  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % , after  <dig> hrs treatment with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mm bso, respectively. the oxidative stress produced in these treatments is not sufficient to be lethal to the cells, in accordance with the mda assay, which shows no increase in lipid peroxidation.

bioreduction activity
time course
the responses of ht <dig> cells to  <dig>  mm bso treatment were tested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs, and results are expressed as percentage of  <dig> hr . for total gsh, frap and abts, 4-hr treatment induced significant decreases , while aop value did not change significantly. from  <dig> hrs to  <dig> hrs, all of the assays showed significant decreases . whereas from  <dig> through  <dig> hrs, no significant change was seen. the data suggests that for  <dig>  mm bso treatment, the majority of the gsh depletion occurred in the first  <dig> hrs, and that the depletion of other antioxidants were dynamically parallel to gsh depletion. cell death was visible under microscopy after  <dig> hrs of  <dig>  or  <dig> mm bso treatments.

seyfried et al.  <cit>  found that pc <dig> cells treated with  <dig>  mm bso maintained  <dig> % of mitochondrial gsh in the first  <dig> hrs, while cytosolic gsh was completely depleted. extending the treatment from  <dig> hrs to  <dig> hrs resulted in  <dig> % depletion of mitochondrial gsh. these data are in agreement with the significant decreases of total gsh level from  <dig> to  <dig> hrs, and from  <dig> hrs to  <dig> hrs in this study, although the differences in cell line and dosage of bso in the two studies should be kept in mind while comparing the results.

antioxidant enzyme activities
glutathione peroxidase
glutathione peroxidases  are selenium-containing antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide to water, or lipid peroxides to ethanols, with gsh as reducing cofactor. five isoforms of the gpx family are commonly known. in this study, the major activity detected by the assay is cellular gpx . figure  <dig> shows the change of gpx activity in response to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm bso treatments for  <dig> hrs. treatment with  <dig> mm bso significantly increased the gpx activity to 127% of control . treatment with  <dig> or  <dig> mm bso decreased the activity by about 20% of control. this treatment was not significant compared to control, but is significant when compared to  <dig> mm bso treatment . the results show that the regulation of gpx activity is dependent on the level of gsh depletion, and that the reserve pool of gsh may have critical function, since slight depletion caused significant changes.

glutathione reductase
glutathione reductase  reduces gssg to gsh using nadph as cofactor. when ht <dig> cells were subjected to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm bso treatment for  <dig> hrs, the gr activity in the cells dropped to 97%, 95% and 94% of control, respectively . at  <dig> mm bso concentration, the decrease is significant  in comparison to the control level. however, the toxicology cdna expression array study in section  <dig> did not show significant changes in the mrna level of gr. the activity decrease of this enzyme may be due to enzyme inactivation caused by oxidative stress.

superoxide dismutase
superoxide dismutase  converts superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide, which can be further detoxified by gpx <dig> or catalase. two isoforms of sod are found in mammalian cells, known as cu/zn-sod and mn-sod, and localized in cytosol and mitochondria, respectively. incubating ht <dig> cells with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mm bso for  <dig> hrs increased the cu/zn-sod activity to 104%, 112%, and 152%  of the control level . the toxicology cdna expression array study found a 2-fold increase of cu/zn-sod mrna level in response to treatment with  <dig> mm bso treatment. in contrast to gpx, sod responds more to severe gsh depletion or higher level of oxidative stress.

toxicology cdna expression array
cdna expression arrays are powerful tools for studying gene expression under various circumstances. in this study, we employed the atlas rat toxicology array ii  to monitor the changes in gene expression after  <dig> hrs treatment with  <dig> mm bso. out of a total of  <dig> genes in the array, mrna level of  <dig> genes were significantly decreased, and  <dig> significantly increased . the increased mrna level of heat shock protein  and eukaryotic peptide chain release factor  <dig>  indicate the stress caused by bso treatment affected proteins at translational and structural levels. the increased mrna level of antioxidant enzymes cu/zn-sod and thioredoxin peroxidase  <dig>  suggests these enzymes have important functions in coping with the oxidative stress caused by gsh depletion. furthermore, both of these enzymes have been shown to protect cells from different inducers of apoptosis  <cit> , indicating that they may have contributed to maintaining high cell viability after bso treatment in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
inhibition of glutamylcysteine synthetase in ht <dig> cells by bso revealed two pools of gsh in the cells, one susceptible to depletion by low concentration of bso, and the other more resistant to depletion. tac values measured by frap, aop and abts methods showed parallel time courses to gsh depletion, but different dose-responses. the gsh depletion studied did not result in increases in gsh/gssg ratio, lipid peroxidation, or cell death, but affected mtt-based cell viability. the antioxidant enzyme activities of gpx, gr and cu/zn-sod were affected by the gsh depletion. the mrna levels of hsp90-beta, erf <dig>  cu/zn-sod and tpx ii were significantly increased after  <dig> mm bso- <dig> hr treatment.
