BACKGROUND
fatty acids are chief components of all living organisms, participating in various metabolic processes such as energy storage and as structural elements of biological membranes. they are the components of a wide variety of lipids including oils, waxes, phospholipids and others. fatty acids occur in saturated and unsaturated forms, a fundamental feature of their physical properties. diet provides a relevant source of fatty acids. monounsaturated fatty acid  de novo synthesis from acyl-coa involves a series of elongations followed by a final desaturation step. desaturation and elongation alternating steps, are also key physiological processes in the generation of long chain or very long chain fatty acids . desaturases comprise a group of membrane-bound enzymes able to activate oxygen and use this reagent to modify c-h bonds at saturated carbons, in diverse substrates such as alkyl groups, acyl residues in thio-, amide- or oxygen-ester linkages, carotenoids, sphingolipids aldehydes and sterols  <cit> . their classification into delta- <dig>  delta- <dig> and delta- <dig> types reflects the position at which a double bond is introduced counting from the methyl end. in the biosynthetic pathway of mufas, a critical committed step is the introduction of the cis- double bound in the delta- <dig> position. this process is catalysed by the steroyl-coa desaturase   <cit> , a rate-limiting enzyme localised to the endoplasmic reticulum and composed of four transmembrane domains . scds introduce a double bond at the delta- <dig> position of saturated fatty acyl-coas such as palmitic and stearic acyl-coa, which are converted to palmitoleoyl-coa and oleoyl-coa, respectively . these in turn represent key substrates for the construction of complex lipid molecules such as phospholipids, triglycerides , wax esters, cholesterol esters , and alkyl- <dig> -diacylglycerols  <cit> . over the years, the accumulated data suggests that scd expression impacts fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, tg and ce, thus changing lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, affecting obesity and membrane fluidity  <cit> . in fact, fatty acid unsaturation is of paramount importance for the physical properties of membrane lipids. in poikilotherms there is a cold induced increase of membrane lipid unsaturation related to a compensatory increase in the fluidity and conservation of membrane physical properties and functions . the ratio of oleic and stearic acid is crucial to the fluidity of membranes and cell-cell interaction  <cit> .

the regulatory setting governing scds is largely derived from data of the four tandem linked genes in the mouse. scd <dig> is highly expressed in liver and adipose tissue  and has a clear upward trend in high carbohydrate diet fed animals  <cit> . a downward expression tendency is observed during starvation and with polyunsaturated fatty acid  rich diets, with an inhibition of the liver scd, which is also observed in humans  <cit> . significantly, scd <dig> knockout mice have an attenuation of the obese phenotype when on a high fat diet  <cit> . there are also some naturally occurring scd <dig> deficient mice strains , which, amongst other traits have impaired triglyceride biosynthesis  <cit> . in fishes, the impact of dietary lipid contents and temperature has also been reported  <cit> . in the common carp, the genome specific duplication has generated two isoforms expressed in the liver  <cit> . a decrease in ambient temperature causes a transient upregulation in one isoform, while dietary fatty acid composition modulates the expression of a second isoform  <cit> . overall, regulation of scd gene expression underscores responses to dietary, thermal and hormonal treatment  <cit> .

the delta- <dig> genes are universally present in living organisms. surprisingly, we find remarkable variability in the gene complement of scds in vertebrate species. the rodent reported gene number varies between four isoforms  in mus musculus  and three in mesocricetus auratus   <cit> , though the absence of full genome information in the later precludes conclusions regarding the absence of a forth gene. in humans two genes have been characterised , scd <dig> being co-orthologous to the four mice genes  <cit> . scd <dig> was initially thought to be primate exclusive, but has now been found in other mammals  and birds  <cit> . scd <dig> is mostly expressed in the brain and pancreas, in both mammals and chicken  <cit> . teleost genes are clearly scd1-type with no report so far on the presence of scd <dig>  <cit> . on the whole, the current distribution of scd genes in the various vertebrate species provides no clear evolutionary scenario for the origin of scd <dig> and scd <dig> . two rounds of genome duplication  in vertebrate ancestry have now been firmly demonstrated with the sequencing of the branchiostoma floridae  genome  <cit> . as a consequence, numerous gene families have specifically expanded up to four copies in the vertebrate lineage. an extra genome duplication in teleosts   <cit>  contributed further to gene number increase. with respect to the scd gene family, while the two scd <dig> teleost isoforms have clearly resulted from 3r  <cit> , the duplication origin of scd <dig> and scd <dig> is unclear. in fact, whereas scd <dig> is present in both actinopterygii and sarcopterygii, scd <dig> has only been reported in amniotes. thus, it is uncertain whether these genes are ancient paralogues, with their origin coinciding with the appearance of vertebrates; or if they result from a more recent event of gene duplication in the amniote lineage. phylogenetics, comparative genomics and examination of evolutionarily informative species should clarify these issues.

the integration of the reported gene diversity with the functional physiological impacts requires the clarification of the scd evolutionary path. here, we provide a clear insight into scd genes in vertebrate history by means of comparative genomics, phylogenetics and gene expression. we determine the timing of the duplication event which gave rise to scd <dig> and scd <dig> paralogues and propose a scenario for the evolution of gene function in the scd gene family.

RESULTS
human scd <dig> and scd <dig> map to the nk-linked paralogon
the first human scd gene to be described, scd <dig>  localizes to the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  importantly, this chromosome region is part of the so-called nk homeobox gene paralogon  <cit> . paralogons are formed by paralogy regions, which in vertebrates largely comprise of a series of unrelated linked genes on one chromosome, which have linked paralogues on three other chromosome regions  due to the 2r events in early vertebrate evolution. the designation of the nk-linked paralogon results from the widespread presence of numerous nk homeobox genes throughout a four composite arrangement, involving chromosomal segments in human chromosomes 2/ <dig> , human chromosome  <dig> , human chromosome  <dig> , and human chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . scd <dig> maps in the proximity of a nk cluster gene pair  at hsa <dig>  <cit> . a second scd gene, named scd <dig>  was recently isolated and characterized in humans  <cit> . it maps to the q arm of hsa <dig>  a location which is also part of the nk gene cluster paralogon, and close to an nk homeobox gene nkx <dig>  . taken together, both sites are highly indicative of a potential involvement of 2r genome duplications in the origin of these two genes. if correct, this would imply that scd <dig> and scd <dig> are old paralogues having emerged in vertebrate ancestry as a consequence of 2r.

we analysed in detail the gene family content in the immediate proximity of scd <dig> and scd <dig> genes in the human genome ), to determine their duplication and mapping patterns. we find twelve and nine open reading frames surrounding scd <dig> and scd <dig>  respectively, within a  <dig> mb interval ). of the various gene families, the majority are single copies. of those which are multi-copy, we find that their duplicate paralogues typically localize to regions of the genome included in the nk-linked paralogon ). this is the case for wnt8b , which has a second member localising to hsa <dig>   <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of this gene family shows a clear pattern of pre-teleost/tetrapod duplication, in agreement with 2r . likewise, in the mapping region of scd <dig> we also find gene families with duplicated members in expected regions of the nk-paralogon. the hnrnpd/hnrpdl pair has a paralogue mapping to hsa <dig> at  <dig> mb from the nk-like homeobox gene msx <dig>  however, the most striking case is represented by the sec <dig> gene family, which is composed of two members: sec31a and sec31b. sec31a maps next to scd <dig> in hsa <dig>  while sec31b is in close proximity to scd <dig> at hsa <dig>  the phylogenetic tree also indicates that, as expected for gene families duplicated from 2r, 31a and 31b genes have duplicated at least before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods . overall, the gene families within the scd genomic regions have a duplication history expected under the 2r genome duplications .

the localization of the human scd gene isoforms in a 2r-generated paralogon implies two testable predictions. unless independent gene expansions have taken place, invertebrate chordates should have a single scd gene equally related to their vertebrate counterparts. second, invertebrate scd genes should be flanked by gene families that have their human orthologues/paralogues localising to regions of scd paralogy , even if conserved micro-synteny  is not observed. to test these predictions, we have analysed the genomic locus of the scd gene in the invertebrate chordate b. floridae. although we expected to find a single scd isoform, our search retrieved three distinct scd-like genes. nevertheless, these represent an independent gene expansion in the amphioxus lineage , since they group together outside of the vertebrate scd1/scd <dig> clade . we name these genes bfscda, bfscdb and bfscdc. with the exception of bfscdc, we find the amphioxus scd's flanked by gene families which have their human homologues mapping to regions of scd paralogy  ). for example, close to bfscdb a single tet1/ <dig> gene is found with the human paralogues tet <dig> and tet <dig> mapping to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively ). a similar situation is found close to bfscda where a grid1/ <dig> gene is found. human grid <dig> and grid <dig> localise to hsa <dig> and hsa <dig> as expected, under the scenario that these regions represent an amphioxus-specific partitioning of the 2r unduplicated genomic locus. thus, although a conserved proximal synteny is not observed, the amphioxus data clearly supports the hypothesis that vertebrate scd <dig> and scd <dig> expanded in the vertebrate lineage as part of 2r genome duplications.

upon its initial characterization, scd <dig> was proposed to be primate specific  <cit> , while scd <dig> had a more widespread presence in vertebrate genomes. however, the more recent identification of scd <dig> orthologues in bovines  <cit> , and chicken  <cit>  suggested that the original scd1/scd <dig> duplication pre-dated the timing of the bird/reptile-mammal divergence. our analysis shows that the genomic location of scd1/scd <dig> and the phylogenetics of flanking gene families indeed supports an older age for the duplication event that gave rise to the scd <dig> and scd <dig> paralogues. the reported scenario strongly hints that scd <dig> and scd <dig> are the remaining two duplicates of the four that originated from an ancestral invertebrate scd gene as a result of 2r. alternatively, after 1r, one of the duplicated scd genes was lost leaving one remaining for duplication during 2r, producing scd <dig> and scd <dig> 

gene loss and tandem duplications illustrate the tetrapod scd repertoire
the evolutionary setting emerging from the paralogy analysis creates some important repercussions. for example, the phylogenetic distribution of both scd isoforms is potentially broader than previously found. also, the absence of scd genes  in vertebrate classes would mean gene loss and not a different timing of the scd1/scd <dig> gene duplication.

to elucidate these matters, we started by analysing tetrapod species using two strategies. firstly, by determining the duplication timing through phylogenetics, and secondly by investigating the scd gene loci in available tetrapod genomes representing various lineages. the information on gene complement and loci organization was collected from homo sapiens , m. musculus , ornithorhynchus anatinus , monodelphis domestica , gallus gallus , anolis carolinensis  and x. tropicalis . the analysis was expanded to include oryctolagus cuniculus  given the surprising number of scd <dig> genes.

the orthology of the designated tetrapod scd <dig> and scd <dig> genes was assessed by the phylogenetic analysis . although some nodes are poorly supported in the scd <dig> branches, in general we find good statistical support for the separation of these two gene lineages, scd <dig> and scd <dig>  in tetrapod species. within the scd <dig> mammalian clade, we find that scd1-type gene expansion is not restricted to the muridae family represented here by m. musculus and rattus norvegicus , though in the later only three scd genes are found. this increase is extended to the entire rodentia order for which genome data  is available . another mammalian species, o. cuniculus, was also found to have an expansion of the scd1-type sequences. the common ancestry between rodents and lagomorphs probably indicates that the expansion of scd <dig> genes took place in the ancestor of both lineages at  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, we find the four rabbit genes to cluster strongly together and not with the previously reported m. musculus genes . though this could imply two separate duplication events, we find gene conversion in the rabbit scd gene cluster a more plausible alternative. as more scd sequences become available in these groups, a detailed analysis should clarify the origin and functional consequences of the reported phylogenetic pattern.

scd <dig> internal nodes are more robustly supported. within tetrapods we find no scd5-like sequence in the amphibian x. tropicalis. in contrast to mice, cavia porcellus  and o. cuniculus have scd <dig> orthologues .

the unsupported position of the amphibian and bird scd <dig> genes raises some questions regarding their orthology. thus, we next inspected the loci gene content as a means to determine a common evolutionary origin. the scd <dig> gene locus is organised in a highly conserved arrangement ). notwithstanding some gene order variation, we find pkd2l <dig> to outflank scd <dig> in most of the analysed species, while wnt8b is typically downstream of scd <dig> ). we confirm that the mouse scd <dig> repertoire is expanded to four members organized in tandem in agreement with previous reports ), and similar to what is found in o. cuniculus ).

next, we examined the scd <dig> genomic locus in the various tetrapod species ). in contrast to scd <dig>  no evidence of gene tandem expansion was observed. scd <dig> retains a single copy status in a highly conserved arrangement across species ). no orthologue was found in x. tropicalis or o. anatinus. as previously noted scd <dig> is absent from m. musculus and r. norvegicus  <cit> . however, we find scd <dig> orthologues in another rodentia species , which indicates that the loss of scd <dig> is secondary and probably restricted to the muridae family . in o. anatinus and x. tropicalis, no scd <dig> was identified. however, we suspect that the low coverage of the genome sequence in the case of the platypus is the likely cause for this absence since we were also unable to find other neighbouring genes. in the case of x. tropicalis, we find that the genes typically flanking scd <dig> in other tetrapod species are present but in different scaffolds ). we find the sec31a gene located at the end of scaffold_ <dig>  a possible indication of a sequence gap in the genome assembly. to investigate whether a potential scd <dig> sequence was present but not assembled, we searched the trace sequence genome archives. no sequence reads with similarity to scd <dig> were found.

an alternate hypothesis, which opposes the paralogy findings, postulates that scd1/scd <dig> isoforms emerged after the divergence of amphibians in the amniote clade. in that case, the amphibian scd gene should out-branch the mammalian, bird and reptile scd1/scd <dig> genes in phylogenetic trees. however, we find that the xenopus gene groups with the described scd <dig> genes , though the bootstrap value is relatively low , when more basal vertebrate lineages are included). documenting gene loss is a challenging task in the presence of incomplete genomes. thus, verifying if scd <dig> absence is a true biological reality in a second amphibian should address both the technical and general implications of this preliminary finding.

teleosts have lost scd <dig> and scd1a/scd1b are 3r paralogues
the scd gene complement is unexpectedly variable in tetrapods. thus, we next inspected various teleost species. these included species with full genomes available such as danio rerio , gasterosteus aculeatus , tetraodon nigroviridis , takifugu rubripes  and oryzias latipes . typically, two scd <dig> genes have been described in this group  <cit> . here, we use a distinct nomenclature for the fish isoforms, scd1a/scd1b in contrast to scd1/scd <dig>  respectively  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis shows that both isoforms are scd <dig> and specifically duplicated in the teleost lineage with two strongly supported groups: 1a and 1b   <cit> . the d. rerio sequences introduced a different topology, in a pattern previously noted  <cit> , and were left out of the phylogenetic analysis. however, the synteny analysis clearly supports that the d. rerio genes are also of the 1a/1b type.

the teleost genome has experienced an extra genome duplication , to the two rounds that initially occurred in stem vertebrate evolution  <cit> . thus, it has already been shown that the scd1a/1b duplicates are the result of the 3r  <cit> . the analysis of the regions harbouring scd1a/scd1b in the five species with fully sequenced genomes confirms this pattern )  <cit> . we find the gene families in the immediate proximity of scd1a to have duplicate members in the scaffold or chromosome where scd1b resides ). for example, dnajb12b maps a few kb away from scd1a, while dnajb12a is immediately localized downstream of scd1b ).

to demonstrate further that the 1a/1b duplication resulted from the 3r genome duplication, we decided to investigate the basal ray-finned fish, polypterus senegalus . this basal actinopterygii diverged pre-3r  <cit> . our degenerate pcr approach isolated a single partial sequence . the inclusion of the bichir sequence in the phylogenetic analysis shows that the p. senegalus scd <dig> outgroups the 1a and 1b teleost genes , adding further support to the proposal that indeed the scd1a/1b duplication resulted from 3r.

no scd <dig> gene sequence has been so far described in teleosts. furthermore, in available full genome teleost sequences no scd <dig> annotation is found. to test whether the absence of scd <dig> orthologues was due to genome incompleteness or absence of gene description, we examined the location of the tetrapod scd5-flanking genes in the available teleost genomes ). the similarity in gene arrangement between the fish group and scd <dig> tetrapod loci is remarkable, and suggests that scd <dig> was a targeted deletion in teleosts. we were unable to confirm if this loss event post or pre dates 3r, since our attempts to isolate scd <dig> from polypterus were unsuccessful. thus, it is unclear if the gene complement in p. senegalus is restricted to scd <dig>  in summary, despite the absence of scd <dig>  we find that teleosts retain an scd gene complement similar to most tetrapods due to the specific duplication of scd <dig> genes.

scd <dig> and scd <dig> orthologues are present in the cartilaginous fish scyliorhinus canicula
one of the predictions emanating from the paralogy analysis is that clear scd <dig> and scd <dig> orthologues should be found in extant vertebrate classes, unless loss events have taken place. scd <dig> genes were found in reptiles and birds so far, but not in teleosts with strong evidence for gene loss. to determine whether scd <dig> and scd <dig> have been preserved in the oldest group of jawed vertebrates, we searched the emerging genome sequence of the elephant shark callorhinchus milii  <cit> . also, using a degenerate pcr strategy we aimed at isolating orthologues of the scd gene family from the lesser spotted dogfish, s. canicula. we found partial sequences with similarity to either scd <dig> or scd <dig> in the elephant shark, but too small to provide solid confirmation . in the case of s. canicula, our approach yielded two distinct sequences with similarity to either scd <dig> or scd <dig>  sequence extension was achieved with various pcr strategies, resulting in two sequences coding for proteins with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids when finally isolated.

to provide a clear confirmation, we have examined the phylogenetic relationships of the s. canicula sequences . we find that these sequences group consistently; scscd <dig> with the scd <dig> clade , and scscd <dig> with scd <dig> genes .

scd tissue expression suggests the conservation of an ancestral function
we next addressed the expression location of newly isolated scd shark genes, as a proxy for functional appraisal. scd <dig> genes are ubiquitously expressed in the various species analysed so far, with high expression being observed in the liver and adipose tissue  <cit> . in contrast, available data on scd <dig> shows that in birds and mammals, a distinct localised expression is observed, with emphasis in the brain and the pancreas  <cit> . in accordance, we find scscd <dig> expressed at variable levels in all the tested tissues , while scscd <dig> has a clear expression in the brain, and a minor expression in the testis and salt secreting rectal gland . a second site of conserved expression between birds and mammals is the pancreas. however, we did not examine the pancreatic expression in s. canicula.

at the start of this investigation, we found that paralogy studies suggested a much earlier date for scd1/scd <dig> duplication, probably to the stem of vertebrate evolution. the finding of clear of scd <dig> and scd <dig> orthologues in a basal jawed vertebrate confirms this hypothesis. the overall phylogenetic analysis also provides insight into a more revealing evolutionary pattern . we note that scd <dig> is retained in all lineages examined, with occasional gene expansion either through tandem duplications or as a result of genome duplications. in rodents and lagomorphs tandem duplications have increased the gene number up to three/four members, while in teleosts the 3r genome duplication is accountable for the presence of two scd <dig> genes. scd <dig> has a more scattered phylogenetic distribution. it has been lost in teleosts and the mammalian muridae family, with its absence in x. tropicalis being impossible to confirm unequivocally at this stage. we conclude that clear scd <dig> and scd <dig> orthologues were present in basal jawed vertebrate, and loss and duplication events took place during vertebrate evolution .

the parallel expression profile between amniote  and chondrichthyes scd orthologues, is a remarkable finding in lineages that have been separated for more than  <dig> million years. it supports some important propositions namely  that they represent an ancestraly conserved trait acquired in vertebrates following 2r  and  that a selective force must be operating to maintain the proteins with similar roles in these distinct lineages. paradoxically, we find an evolutionary pattern of clear scd <dig> gene loss in at least two groups, which at face value contradict the relevance of the conserved function of scd <dig> and scd <dig> . for example, we find loss of scd <dig> in teleosts and some rodents . this opposes the specific scd <dig> localised brain expression as being evolutionarily relevant, unless particular adaptations have taken place. in support, we find some observations to explain partially this apparent contradiction. in mice although having lost scd <dig>  the scd <dig> complement expanded to four genes. the expression profile of the murine scd1/2/3/ <dig> genes shows a compartmented profile: scd <dig> is highly expressed in the liver, scd <dig> is exclusively found in the heart, scd <dig> is unique to the skin, and scd <dig> is almost entirely restricted to the brain  <cit> . thus, having lost scd <dig> and its localized expression in the brain, an apparent functional recruitment of the murine scd <dig> has taken place. as for teleosts a more complex outline emerges. while no scd <dig> orthologue exists, scd1b was found to be expressed almost uniquely in the d. rerio brain   <cit> . this observation also suggests that a selective pressure is present for the maintenance of a scd "brain function" in zebrafish. this is a noteworthy pattern of apparent functional interchange between 2r and 3r paralogues and echoes the functional swapping between 2r paralogues  <cit> . the case of the scd <dig> in teleosts mimics that of the cdx transcription factor gene family. the cdx gene complement is composed of three genes in vertebrate classes . however, in teleosts cdx <dig> has been lost, while cdx <dig> has duplicated as a result of 3r  <cit> . the characterization of cdx1a/cdx1b in zebrafish shows that cdx1b replaced the role of mammalian cdx <dig> in gut development  <cit> , in a functionally equivalence process.

to infer whether the teleost scd1a/b expression profile corresponds to a transversal pattern retained in teleost species needs clarification. currently, with the exception of zebrafish no other complete dataset involving the expression of both isoforms is available. thus, we analysed the 1a/1b profile in the stickleback. surprisingly, in g. aculeatus, scd1a and scd1b are found ubiquitously , in sharp contrast to the zebrafish. scd regulation parallels other gene involved in teleost lipid metabolism. elov <dig>  an enzyme essential for the elongation of lc-pufas, is present in freshwater ostariophysan species , while absent in the acanthopterygii order   <cit> . it has been proposed that the retention of elov <dig> is related with the poor-lc-pufas in freshwater habitats, when compared to marine ecosystems which are fuelled with phytoplankton  <cit> . in the context of the delta- <dig> desaturation, a distinct regulation of scd expression in zebrafish and stickleback could be related with distinct availabilities of fatty acids  in their habitat or differences in feeding strategies. also, in the common carp two scd <dig> genes are expressed exclusively in the liver and subjected to distinct regulation, one of which is independent of dietary inputs  <cit> . however, these are not directly comparable since they are carp genome specific scd1a duplicates  <cit> . we note also that in the grass carp  scd1a is expressed strongly in the liver with vestigial signs in the brain  <cit> , but so far no orthologue of scd1b has been described. determining the expression of scd1a and scd1b genes in a larger panel of teleost species should prove clarifying.

whereas the function and regulation of scd <dig> is widely studied, scd5's particular function is largely unknown. however, in humans, both genes shown similar subcellular localization  <cit> . surprisingly, they also show similar desaturase activities in vitro, both producing oleic acid  <cit> . where they differ distinctly is in their expression pattern, an aspect which we now conclude dates back to the origin of gnathostomes. the brain scd <dig> profile is most suggestive. oleic acid, one of the outputs of the scd enzymatic action, is a relevant component of the brain, in particular of myelin  <cit> . lengi and corl  <cit>  have put forward that the maintenance of optimum levels of oleic acid in the brain might signal the potential role of scd <dig>  in fact, in rats the levels and origin of oleic acid in the brain appear to be independent of the diet  <cit> . in this context and in contrast to scd <dig>  scd <dig> regulation  would be independent  of low dietary intake. in agreement, the mouse scd <dig> regulation  is not influenced in the adult irrespective of the dietary intake of pufas  <cit> . thus, we propose that a major distinction between scd <dig> and scd <dig> would be at the regulatory level, with scd <dig> being unresponsive to external inputs  in its action in the brain . in this context, the acquisition of this novel setup would allow the maintenance of optimal oleic acid levels in brain cell membranes , irrespective of environmental availability of lipid food sources. in support, we find that one of the common carp scd <dig> specific duplicates behaves independently of dietary variation in the response to cold induction  <cit> .

scd <dig> has also been shown to be highly expressed in the pancreas, in birds and mammals  <cit> , a tissue we have not examined in s. canicula. elevated levels of saturated fatty acids have been linked with beta cell death in vitro  <cit> . scd activity was recently shown to be involved in a cytoprotective mechanism by transferring saturated fatty acids into mufas which are then incorporated into lipids  <cit> . the contribution of scd <dig> to this role has not yet been elucidated, as well as its expression pattern under different dietary conditions. to understand if this is also conserved between the various vertebrate species remains a challenge.

overall, two alternate possibilities can explain the phylogenetics and genomics data reported here. either, an ancestral scd gene gave rise to four genes as a result of 2r, with two genes being lost; or after 1r, one scd gene was deleted with the remaining scd duplicating during 2r. both proposed scenarios resulted in the retention of scd <dig> and scd <dig> in most lineages. we suggest that these genes have diverged functionally, with scd <dig> gaining a distinct regulatory program from that of scd <dig>  probably independent of external dietary lipid inputs.

CONCLUSIONS
we find that the duplication which gave origin to the scd1/scd <dig> paralogues dates back to the 2r genome duplications. concomitantly, we find scd <dig> and scd <dig> in a basal jawed vertebrate, the cartilaginous fish. we argue that a regulatory divergence between scd <dig> and scd <dig>  accounts for their functional differentiation in the aftermath of 2r. thus, a tissue specific expression  emerged in vertebrate ancestry allocated to the scd <dig> isoform, which has been selectively kept in most lineages. however, exceptions have survived the loss of scd <dig>  a "brain" specific expression is still retained, albeit through the use of diverse strategies. in muridae, a scd1-type gene  has fulfilled the function. in the teleost d. rerio, a 3r scd <dig> gene also has a localised expression in the brain. we consider that the interplay of gene regulatory setups in a selective environment was at play in the scd evolution, and was probably involved in the emergence of a scd gene expression independent of dietary intakes. overall, we provide a clear framework of the evolutionary history of scd genes in vertebrates that should prove instrumental for the functional analysis that may follow.
