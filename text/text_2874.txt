BACKGROUND
transcriptional regulation of gene expression is the one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in plants. transcription factors mediate transcriptional regulation in response to developmental and environmental changes. generally, transcription factors can be grouped into specific families on the basis of their shared structural characteristics. gras proteins belong to a plant family of transcription factors and are named for the three founding members: gibberellic acid insensitive , repressor of ga <dig> , and scarecrow   <cit> . recently, gras proteins were also identified in bacterial  <cit> . typically, gras proteins are 400– <dig> amino acids in length. they share a variable n-terminus and a highly conserved c-terminus that contains five recognizable motifs, found in the following order: leucine heptad repeat i , vhiid, leucine heptad repeat ii , pfyre, and saw  <cit> . among these, the pfyre motif consists of three units: p, fy, and re and the saw motif is characterized by three pairs of conserved residues: r-e, w-g, and w-w  <cit> . significantly, the vhiid, pfyre, and saw domains act as repression domains in slr <dig> protein  <cit> . the distinguishing domains of gras proteins are two leucine-rich areas flanking a vhiid motif, which may act as a dna-binding domain, analogous to the bzip protein–dna interaction domain  <cit> . moreover, most gras proteins are nuclear localized except the pat <dig> and scl <dig>  which are dual-localized to cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> .

as transcription factors, gras proteins have been shown to play critical roles in many specific biological processes related to gibberellin signal transduction  <cit> , axillary meristem initiation  <cit> , shoot meristem maintenance  <cit> , root radial pattering  <cit> , phytochrome a signal transduction  <cit> , and male gametogenesis  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis, five della proteins—gai, rga, rgl <dig>  rgl <dig>  and rgl3—act as repressors of gibberellin-responsive plant growth. in rice, osmoci has been demonstrated to control tillering  <cit> . in petunia, phham is essential for maintaining the shoot apical meristem  <cit> . recently, thanks to the development of bioinformatics and novel molecular biology techniques, comprehensive expression analyses have been carried out by reverse transcription-pcr , cdna or oligo microarray, and cdna real-time pcr at the genome-wide level. these analyses contribute to our understanding of the function of the gras family  <cit> .

after the first member of gras protein, scarecrow, being isolated from arabidopsis  <cit> , gras proteins in different taxonomic groups have been identified, including tomato, petunia, lily, rice, grape, pine, maize, and barley. a great diversity of gras genes exists, depending on the species. so far, various in silico analysis have predicted  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gras genes in arabidopsis, rice, and chinese cabbage  <cit> , respectively. meanwhile, the rapid development of large-scale genome sequencing and comparative genomics would likely lead to the discovery of gras proteins in other plants. although great diversity exists among species in terms of genome size, ploidy level and chromosome numbers, attempts have been made to reveal the existing synteny and colinearity on the basis of comparative genomics.

the recently completed sequencing and assembly work provide an opportunity to better understand the evolution of the gras superfamily at the whole-genome level. in present work, we identified gras gene families in six plant species: arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens. then we constructed a phylogenetic tree to evaluate evolutionary relationships among the gras genes in the six plant species and calculated the synonymous substitution rates  to date the duplication events. then, we analyzed the expression profiles of gras genes in different tissues, which indicated broad functional divergence within this family. to examine the driving force for the evolution of function, we further analyzed functional divergence and adaptive evolution at the amino acid level. our systematic analysis provided a solid foundation for further functional dissection and molecular evolution of gras genes in plants.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of gras gene family
in silico analyses have predicted that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gras genes exist in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens, respectively . the names of the gras genes, the locus gene, the chromosome and location, the length of the amino acid sequence, the isoelectric point , and the molecular weight  were supplied in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  most of the deduced gras amino acid sequence lengths varied from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, while more than half of proteins from p. patens contained more than  <dig> amino acids. the pi of the majority of gras proteins varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and a minority of gras proteins were alkalescent. of all the gras proteins, those from arabidopsis and p. patens were all faintly acid, whereas the highest pi of the gras proteins,  <dig> , was found in b. distachyon. the mw of all gras proteins ranged from  <dig>  kd to  <dig>  kd. these results implied that the amino acid sequence length and physicochemical properties of gras proteins may have changed to meet different functions.

all gras proteins were mapped onto the corresponding chromosomes except s. moellendorffii and p. patens . in arabidopsis, the predicted  <dig> atgras  genes were distributed among the five chromosomes. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> had a maximum of nine and seven atgras genes, respectively, whereas six atgras genes were found on each of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  in b. distachyon, the predicted  <dig> bdgras  genes were also distributed among the five chromosomes. chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> had a maximum of  <dig> and  <dig> bdgras genes, respectively, while chromosome  <dig> had a minimum of two bdgras genes. in rice, the putative  <dig> osgras  genes were organized on  <dig> out of the  <dig> chromosomes. chromosome  <dig> had a maximum of nine osgras genes, while chromosome  <dig> had a minimum of two osgras genes. chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained five osgras genes each, and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contained four osgras genes each. in soybean, the  <dig> gmgras  genes were dispersed on the  <dig> chromosomes, with  <dig> members, the highest density of gmgras genes, on chromosome  <dig>  five gmgras genes were found on each of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  four each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and three each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

phylogenetic relationships among gras proteins
comparison of conserved motifs among members of the gras family implied that they can be divided into different groups and subgroups. to better separate the groups and investigate the evolutionary relationships among gras proteins in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens, an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed from  <dig> full-length amino acid sequences using the neighbor-joining  algorithm . to confirm the tree topologies, a ml  phylogenetic tree was also constructed, and it showed similar topology to the nj tree with only minor modifications . a me  phylogenetic tree was also constructed, which showed the same topology to the nj tree . although the nj tree was usually the same as the me tree, when the number of taxa was small the difference between the nj and me trees can be substantial  <cit> . in this case if a long dna or amino acid sequence was used, the me tree was preferable. when the number of nucleotides or amino acids used was relatively small, the nj method generated the correct topology more often than did the me method  <cit> . in this study, the average amino acid-length of  <dig> gras proteins was ~ <dig>  so the me tree was credible. taken together, the nj phylogenetic tree was adopted for further analysis. based on the information from previous analyses and from the topology of the tree and position of conserved motifs, we grouped all the gras genes into seven major clusters, group i–vii  <cit> . group v was further divided into two subgroups, va and vb. the numbers of gras proteins in different groups were shown in additional file  <dig>  among the groups, group ii constituted the largest clade. it contained  <dig> members and accounted for  <dig> % of the total gras genes. meanwhile, the number of group ii genes from angiosperm also reached the maximum in comparison with the other subgroups, which strongly indicates that these gras genes were more likely to be retained in group ii. on the contrary, the members of s. moellendorffii and p. patens more gathered in group v. moreover, the identified della proteins: gai, rga, rgl <dig>  rgl <dig>  rgl <dig>  and slr <dig>  were all present in group iv  <cit> . we also deduced twelve della proteins  on the basis of the feature that della proteins contain conserved della and vhynp motifs in their n-terminal regions and belong to group iv. moreover, the tree  also showed many putative orthologs  supported by the high bootstrap values.figure  <dig>

the comparative analyses of the complete amino acid sequences of the gras proteins were in agreement with the presented phylogenetic analysis, and showed that several family- and subfamily-specific conserved motifs could be determined for each of the defined groups. gras proteins share a highly conserved c-terminal region containing the vhiid motif flanked by two leucine heptad repeats , then the pfyre motif, and finally the saw motif. the feature of five motifs has been reported many times in previous studies  <cit> . for example, lhr i and lhr ii appear to consist of two repeat units . the vhiid motif is readily recognizable in all members because of its p-n-h-d-q-l residues. significantly, our results were quite similar to their statements, and the multiple sequence alignment of the six plant species’ gras domains were listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  in short, a large number of c-terminal homologies exist between gras proteins, suggesting that these conserved residues were required to enable the activity of the gras gene products. in addition, a meme search for conserved protein motifs outside the gras domain was conducted to determine possible mechanisms for the structural evolution of gars genes. as a few smgras  and ppgras  genes shared the same motif with the four other species, only the motif data of angiosperms were presented in additional file  <dig>  among them, five motif components  were only detected in group ii. interestingly, motif  <dig> was found only in monocots , suggesting that these genes diverged after the monocot–dicot split. della proteins shared the same two motif components  in group iv, which was significantly different from the other groups. most of the members in group i contained motif  <dig>  a schematic diagram of the gras protein motifs was shown in additional file  <dig>  in short, the differences of motif distribution in different groups or subgroups of gras genes revealed that the function of the gras genes may have diverged in the evolution.

the intron distribution can also provide important evidence to support phylogenetic relationships within a gene family. to identify the gene structure evolution of gras proteins, gene structure display server analysis was applied to  <dig> gras genes. the putative gene structure of the predicted gras gene family was shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of the  <dig> gras genes,  <dig> had introns and  <dig> had no introns. among these, loc_os10g <dig> seemed to have a complex gene structure with nine introns. in short, a majority of gras genes from angiosperm and s. moellendorffii  either lacked introns or had only a single intron, which suggests that these gras genes were conserved. however, the gras genes from p. patens were quite different from those of other species,  <dig> %  genes had more than one intron, including three ppgras genes with six introns, one ppgras gene with five introns, seven ppgras genes with four introns, and three ppgras genes with three introns. these results revealed that the intron evolution of gras genes may have a higher variability in p. patens. in addition,  <dig> %  ppgras genes had one or zero intron, which was similar to that of angiosperm and s. moellendorffii. this phenomenon indicated that the ancient ppgras genes may have multiple introns but gradually lose some introns in evolution. finally, most ppgras genes lost all introns or only retained a single intron.

together, these results showed that gras proteins can be classified into seven large groups , and this classification was supported by the position of conserved motifs. most gras proteins had a similar exon–intron structure except p. patens, indicating that these conserved intron structures were something like necessary for the regulation of gras gene expression.

duplication events in the gras gene family
it is well known that gene duplication provides the raw material for function diversification. gene families can arise through tandem amplification, resulting in a clustered occurrence, or through segmental duplication of chromosomal regions, resulting in a scattered occurrence of family members. in this analysis, we focused on the tandem and segmental duplication modes. to identify the amplification patterns of the gras gene family, we first identified the existence of tandem duplications. of the  <dig> gras genes,  <dig>  were clustered together, with a maximum of  <dig> extra genes between them, and may be considered tandemly duplicated genes  <cit> . the members of tandemly duplicated genes in the six plant species were listed in table  <dig>  including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 2genes in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens respectively. intriguingly, all the putative tandemly duplicated genes were found in group ii except loc_os02g <dig> and loc_os02g <dig>  suggesting that tandem duplication may contribute more to the expansion of the gras genes family in group ii than in other groups. an effective and efficient way to detect segmental duplication events is to identify additional paralogous protein pairs in the neighborhood of each of the gras genes  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> pairs  of paralogous genes were detected, supported by the high bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree and the similar exon–intron structures, which suggests that segmental duplication has contributed to the expansion of the gras gene family. more intriguingly, segmental duplication events appeared to be rare in the gras gene family except in soybean , with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> pairs in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens respectively. about 79%  of gmgras genes included segmental duplications, indicating that segmental duplication events were mainly found in the soybean genome. in short, segmental and tandem duplication events were involved in the expansion of the gras superfamily in all species except s. moellendorffii. among these, tandem duplication greatly amplified group ii, and segmental duplication were the dominant pattern in the evolution of gmgras genes. however, in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens, no single expansion pattern exhibited dominance, indicating that gras genes from these species might have been subjected to a more complex evolutionary mechanism.table  <dig>

previous studies have reported several rounds of whole-genome duplication  in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, and p. patens. thus, the approximate dates of the segmental duplication events were estimated using ks. the mean ks values, standard deviations, and estimated dates for all segmental duplication events corresponding to gras genes were listed in table  <dig>  in arabidopsis, six pairs of atgras paralogous genes originated around  <dig>  mya  to  <dig>  mya, which was consistent with the date of the recent large-scale duplications which occurred at 24– <dig> mya  <cit> . in b. distachyon, three pairs of bdgras paralogous genes corresponded to a wgd event that is thought to have occurred around 56– <dig> mya  <cit> . the other two pairs likely resulted from a single duplication event which occurred at about  <dig> mya. in rice, nine pairs of osgras paralogous genes appeared to be derived from a wgd which occurred at 40– <dig> mya  <cit> . one pair  of segmental duplicates were estimated to originate around  <dig> mya, which was compatible with a segmental duplication that occurred on the ends of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  estimated to have been separated in evolution for 5– <dig> mya  <cit> . in soybean, schmutz et al. have found that two large-scale duplication events occurred at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mya, respectively  <cit> . our results focused on two periods, 9– <dig> mya and 40– <dig> mya, which were roughly consistent with the age of the two duplication events. in the previous study, du et al.  <cit>  have identified genes which originate from wgd duplication and independent duplication in soybean genome. to further verify the results, we compared the  <dig> segmentally duplicated gmgras genes identified in our study with the results of du et al.  <cit> . we concluded that  <dig> of  <dig>  gmgras genes were originated from wgds, whereas  <dig> of  <dig>  gmgras genes were derived from independent duplication events . in p. patens, rensing et al. found an ancient genome duplication event that was thought to have occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> . later, they reported that the ks distribution plot  among paralogs showed a clear peak at around  <dig>  to  <dig>  in  <dig>  which suggests that a large-scale duplication, possibly involving the whole genome, has occurred  <cit> . our results showed that the ks value of four pairs of ppgras paralogous genes range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which was compatible with the previous study. in s. moellendorffii, no segmental and tandem duplication events were detected, and this result may have some connection with the fact that the selaginella genome lacks evidence of an ancient whole-genome duplication or polyploidy  <cit> . in addition, these results were consistent with the analyses of edger et al. that transcription factors were preferentially retained following wgds  <cit> . we also submitted all deduced tandemly duplicated genes to the plant genome duplication database to obtain tandemly duplicated pairs in six species. however, no homologous genes were found among species, indicating that those tandemly duplicated genes were retained after speciation of six species we studied.

in short, tandem duplication events played an important role in the expansion of group ii. segmental duplication was predominant among gras genes in soybean. moreover, a great majority of the genes involved in segmental duplication were retained after wgds.

functional divergence analysis of gras family
two types  of functional divergence between gene clusters of the gras subfamily were inferred by posterior analysis using diverge <dig>  which estimates significant changes in the site-specific shift of evolutionary rate  or the site-specific shift of amino acid properties  after the emergence of two paralogous sequences  <cit> . the advantage of these methods is that they use amino acid sequences and therefore are not sensitive to the saturation of synonymous sites  <cit> . the estimation was based on the gras protein nj tree, in which eight major subfamilies were clearly presented with highly significant support from bootstrap values. the result showed that the coefficient of type i functional divergence  between any two relevant clusters was significantly greater than  <dig> , which indicates a highly different site-specific altered selective constraint between them. the coefficients of type ii functional divergence  were only significant  between i/iii, iii/iv, and iii/v, particularly iii/v. the coefficient of type ii functional divergence  between other groups was smaller than  <dig>  while the standard errors were relatively high. these results revealed that the functional evolution of subfamilies of the gras gene family might adopt type i and type ii functional divergence in different degrees.table  <dig>

to identify the critical amino acid sites  that may be responsible for functional divergence between gras subgroups, the posterior probability  of divergence was identified using functional divergence-related residues  <cit> . a large qk value indicates a high possibility that the functional constraint or amino acid physiochemical property of a site differ between two clusters. in this study, qk >  <dig>  was used as the cutoff to identify caass between gene clusters. our results showed distinct differences in the number of sites for which functional divergence was predicted within each pair. a total of  <dig> caass  were predicted by type i functional divergence analysis. of these,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> type i-related caass were identified for the i/vii, ii/iv, i/ii, and i/iii pairs, respectively, which suggests that these sites might act as a major evolutionary force driving the divergence of i/vii, ii/iv, i/ii, and i/iii. meanwhile,  <dig> type ii-related caass were identified for i/ii, i/v, i/vi, i/vii, iii/iv, and iii/vii pairs. compared with only three caass for the type i functional divergence between i/va, there were  <dig> predicted sites for type ii functional divergence, indicating that the rapid change in amino acid physiochemical properties was mainly attributed to the functional divergence between the two groups of genes, and secondarily attributed to the shift in evolution rate. the case was similar for i/ii and i/vii pairs. however, most of the pairs did not follow the above model, indicating that site-specific shifts in evolutionary rate and changes in amino acid property do not uniformly act on the gras subfamily members over evolutionary time. finally,  <dig> amino acids were identified as co-occurring amino acids for both type i and type ii functional divergence , suggesting that these sites were important for the subgroup-specific functional evolution of the gras gene.

positive selection in the gras gene family
positive selection is one of the major forces in the emergence of new motifs and functions in proteins after gene duplication. in this study, likelihood ratio tests were implemented in the paml v <dig>  software package  <cit>  to test the hypothesis of positive selection in the gras gene family using a site-specific model. first, we performed independent analyses of positive selection using full-length protein gras sequences from six different species. the results  showed that none caass for positive selection were identified in arabidopsis, rice, or soybean, b. distachyon, s. moellendorfii, while  <dig>  positive selection sites were identified in p. patens based on the bayes empirical bayes  estimation method. these results implied that ppgras genes were under higher positive selection pressure, while the other five species appeared to be more conservative. analysis of the combined six species was also performed, and the parameter estimates and log-likelihood values for each model are provided in table  <dig>  the lrt statistic for m <dig> vs. m <dig> comparison was 2∆ℓ =  <dig> , much greater than critical values from aχ2distribution with d.f. =  <dig>  indicating that one category of ω was insufficient to describe the variability in selection pressure across amino acid sites. however, when m7/m <dig> was compared, none caass were identified as positively selected sites. this result suggested that gras gene superfamily was relatively conserved during evolution. in short, gras genes were subject to different levels of positive selection pressure, regardless of whether the genes were intraspecific or interspecific.table  <dig>

to study the adaptive evolution of the gras subfamilies, we further analyzed the branch-site model. on the gras gene tree , seven branches  were independently defined as the foreground branch. table  <dig> listed parameter estimates and log-likelihood values under the branch-site models. none or a few remarkably significant sites were found under the x <dig> test  in groups ii, iii, iv, vi, and vii. however, significant positive selection was detected when group i and v were defined as the foreground branch. among them,  <dig> sites were identified as positively selected sites when branch i was considered to be the foreground branch and four of them  were significant according to the x <dig> test .  <dig> sites were identified as positively selected sites when branch v was considered the foreground branch. of these sites, one positive selection site  was at the  <dig>  significance level, while ten sites  were at the  <dig>  significance level. these results suggested that groups i and v were confronted with strong positive selection pressure, as many highly significant positive sites were present, whereas the other groups were likely experiencing strong purifying or neutral selection pressure.table  <dig>

finally, we observed relationships between amino acid sites under positive selection and functional divergence,  <dig> critical amino acid sites were under positive selection as well as type i and type ii functional divergence . we located them on the three-dimensional gras structure and performed multiple sequence alignment to further investigate their function. as the displayed sequence produced incompetence by cphmodels  <cit> , only  <dig> sites were labeled on the three-dimensional structure, and other amino acid sites were labeled in multiple sequence alignment . among these, two amino acids  was located on the lhri motif, three amino acids  were located on the vhiid motif, and four amino acids  were located on the lhrii motif, and five amino acids  were located on the pfyre motif. in short, most of the amino acids were located on the α - helix. these results revealed that these amino acids may act as a major evolutionary force driving the divergence of gras-conserved motifs and may further affect the divergence of gras subgroup functions. more experimental evidence is needed to understand the functional importance of the identified caass. in addition, zhang et al. recovered significant hits to several rossmann fold methyltransferase domains in bacterial gras proteins  <cit> . surprisingly, we also found the rossmann fold  in our protein . these results also showed that the structure of gras proteins was conserved in lower and higher organisms.figure  <dig>

expression analysis of gras genes
to investigate the expression patterns of homologous gras genes in subgroups involved in plant growth and development, we constructed a heat map using the gene pattern program. as the microarray data and rna-seq atlas of b. distachyon was incomplete, we focused on the three other species  studied in this paper. in arabidopsis, the probeset id of at2g <dig> cannot be found in the ath <dig> data source. thus, only  <dig> atgras genes were considered in our analysis of differential expression. in rice, eight genes  cannot be found in their corresponding probeset. a total of  <dig> probesets corresponding to  <dig> out of  <dig>  unigenes were found. in soybean, the expression values of glyma02g <dig>  glyma03g <dig>  glyma10g <dig>  glyma11g <dig>  glyma12g <dig>  glyma15g <dig>  glyma17g <dig>  glyma19g <dig>  and glyma20g <dig> were zero, indicating that these  <dig> genes were expressed in some special tissues or organs were stress induced . moreover, glyma01g <dig> lacked expression information in soybase. consequently, distinct transcript abundance patterns for only  <dig> gmgras genes were readily identifiable in the rna-seq atlas dataset.

according to the expression profiles in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  broadly, our results showed that most grass had different expression levels in different tissues or organs. further, some of the gras genes were obviously expressed in the vegetative growth stage and reproductive growth stages, suggesting that these gras genes may regulate specific functions corresponding to different stages in plant growth and development. meanwhile, the same tissues and organs were regulated by multiple genes and the levels of expression differed in different gras genes, suggesting that multiple gras genes were involved in regulating the growth and development of the same tissues or organs. the gras genes showed different preferential expression in different species, and most gras genes exhibited expression profiles with marked peaks in only a single tissue type. in particular, there were many tissue-specific genes in soybean . for example, five genes were expressed only in the root, and two genes were expressed only in the seed. these results indicated that those gras proteins function as tissue-specific regulators or were limited to a single organ or cell type. moreover, lee et al. have described the expression analysis of some gras genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . although the processing time was different, our results showed that many atgras genes had the similar level of expression. for example, scl <dig> showed higher levels of expression in the leaves, flowers, and seeds than in the roots, which confirmed the previous view that scl <dig> played a role in the aerial parts. many of the other scl genes showed expression in the root, including scl <dig>  scl <dig>  scl <dig>  scl <dig>  scl <dig>  scl <dig>  and so on. in addition, there were subgroups of genes that exhibited similar expression profiles in the same species but were relatively phylogenetically distinct. however, several phylogenetic clades shared the same transcript abundance profile to a large extent. in group iii, a phylogenetic clade included nine gras genes from three species  that were preferentially expressed in the root. evidently, the expression patterns of homologous gene subgroups are conserved at different degrees among the three species we studied.figure  <dig>

it is well known that gene duplication increases expression diversity and enables tissue or developmental specialization to evolve. the ohno’s classic model  <cit>  concerning the fate of duplicated genes and the duplication–degeneration–complementation  model, predict for each one of the duplicates the gain of a new function , its loss  or the development of overlapping redundant functions and expression patterns   <cit> . to trace expression diversification and functionality of gras duplicated genes, arabidopsis represents a model system for which both genome structure and gene expression patterns have been extensively studied. as shown in addition file  <dig>  one pair of duplicated genes  had a same expression patterns. however, at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  which exhibited the most redundant expression, develop opposite regulatory actions as they promote/repress, respectively, germination in response to leaves and roots. this effect would be more related to a case of neofunctionalization. the similar cases were found in the remaining duplicated genes. in addition, a pseudogenization process might be occurring in another pair of duplicated genes . the former seems to have a noticeably weaker expression than the latter in seeds. however, the fact that at1g <dig> has a certain level of expression in the seeds could mean that the pseudogenization has not been completed.

in short, the expression profiles of the members of the gras subgroups were different in various organs and species, indicating that gras genes were differentially expressed in different groups and species, and the regulatory regions of gras genes may have diverged. significantly, the results also demonstrated the expression divergence of the gras duplicated genes in the evolution.

in this study, we identified  <dig> gras genes from six plant species and constructed a phylogenetic tree  that classified all the gras genes into seven major clusters, groups i–vii supported by the positions of conserved motifs. there was considerable bootstrapping value support for many of the defined groups and subgroups in the tree, but poor supporting values remained for several clusters. this was an expected consequence of performing a study like the present one with an average about  <dig> amino acid-length sequences, a constraint imposed by a large number of substitutable residues among gras-conserved motifs. it is worth mentioning that the definitions of most of the groups were supported by the presence of common protein motifs outside the gras domain. in each group, the number of gras genes in soybean was two or three times as high as the number of gras genes in other species, and there were many more tandem and segmental duplication events in soybean than in other species. the main reason may be that soybean has a highly duplicated genome  with more duplications than arabidopsis   <cit> , b. distachyon   <cit> , rice   <cit> , s. moellendorffii   <cit>  or p. patens   <cit>  and nearly 75% of the genes present showed multiple copies  <cit> .

on the other hand, most of the closely related members in the phylogenetic tree had common motif compositions, suggesting that there were functional similarities among the gras proteins within the same subfamily, so phylogenetic analysis will also facilitate functional genomics studies. for instance, the deduced twelve della proteins clustered well with the determined six della proteins , which mediate the regulation of gene expression by gibberellins  <cit> . in the tree , one cluster of two gmgras proteins  was clustered well with pat <dig>  which functions in the response to far-red light and appears to act early in the phytochrome a signaling pathway. thus, the mechanism of action of these two gmgras proteins may be similar to that of the pat <dig> protein. similar cases were found in clusters consisting of shr /glyma01g40180/glyma11g05110/glyma05g22460/glyma17g <dig>  scl <dig> /glyma17g01150/glyma07g39650/glyma09g01440/glyma15g <dig>  scl <dig> /glyma01g43620/glyma11g01850/glyma11g10170/glyma12g <dig>  and scr /glyma18g45220/glyma09g40620/loc_os11g03110/loc_os12g <dig>  among these, shr is involved in the radial organization of the root and shoot axial organs  <cit> , scl <dig> is a positive regulator of phytochrome-dependent red-light signaling  <cit> , scl <dig> promotes gibberellin signaling by antagonizing master growth repressor della in arabidopsis  <cit> , and the scr gene regulates an asymmetric cell division  <cit> .

intron evolution is an important part of genomic evolution, as well as being an adaptive process for speciation. our results showed that most gras proteins had few introns , and only a few gras genes had two introns. the similar gene structure of highly conserved introns was important to the molecular evolution of the gras family. however, most gras genes from p. patens had a different number of introns, and almost half of them had a longer sequence outside the gras domain than other species, suggesting that the evolution of introns in ppgras genes was a diverse and complex process.

expansion pattern of the gras gene family
edger et al.  <cit>  stated that dosage-sensitive genes, including transcription factors, were preferentially retained following wgds. recently, it was verified that some transcription factor families, such as wrky and dof, expanded through segmental duplication events, and most of them were retained after wgds  <cit> . some large multiprotein complexes also follow the same pattern. for example, zhu et al. demonstrated that most of the segmentally duplicated soybean expansin genes have been retained from wgds  <cit> . the present study showed that most identified segmentally duplicated genes in six species were also retained by wgd, which supported the results of edger et al. on the other hand, in terms of groups, group ii  was the largest clade within the total group of gras genes, and most of the deduced tandemly duplicated genes were found in that group. this result demonstrated that tandem duplication greatly promoted the expansion of group ii. however, the reasons for this result were unclear, and further research was needed. in terms of species, soybean had the most gras genes members in the six species we studied, and several factors may account for this. one reason is that soybean is an ancient polyploid with a larger genome than many other species. another reason is two large-scale wgds, which occurred at approximately  <dig> and  <dig> mya resulted in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in multiple copies, and most genes involved in segmental duplication were retained after wgds . specially, segmental duplication is the predominant expansion pattern for gras genes in soybean. among these, four pairs of gmgras genes  were detected in both tandem and segmental duplication events, demonstrating that four pairs of gmgras genes experienced two different types of expansions. however, the estimated dates of these genes originated from segmental duplication events were obviously different, revealing that these gmgras genes first underwent tandem duplication and secondly segmental duplication. in short, the gras genes family showed different preferential the expansion patterns in different species. these different evolutionary patterns of the gras gene family in different species will help to facilitate further gene function analysis.

as table  <dig> shown, the estimated dates of all deduced paralogous gene pairs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya, and all deduced tandemly duplicated genes may have originated after the speciation of their respective species. taken together, the results clearly indicated that these gras duplicated genes, including 42% , 32% , 47% , 89% , and 26%  genes in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, and p. patens respectively, postdate the monocot–dicot split by approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, the presence of some p. patens sequences in the seven subfamilies suggests that gras gene family was formed before the divergence of mosses and the seed plant ancestors. engstrom  found that major gras protein subfamilies are ancient, which is consistent with results of nishiyama et al. that the gras gene family arose before the appearance of land plants, over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the above analysis revealed that the gras gene family may originate from a common ancestor, followed by lineage-specific expansion and divergence in each lineage and species during its evolution. moreover, the change of number of introns also revealed the evolution of introns of gras gene family. most gras genes from angiosperm and s. moellendorffii either lacked introns or had only a single intron, while  <dig> % ppgras genes had multiple introns, which suggests that gras gene family may initially contain multiple introns then lost all introns or only retained a single intron in evolution. in addition, tian et al. deduced that there were two pairs of osgras ancient duplicates, on the basis of the juxtaposition of loc_os05g42130/loc_os07g <dig> with at3g <dig> and loc_os03g31880/loc_os07g <dig> with at4g <dig> in the phylogenetic tree, and at3g <dig> and at4g <dig> were ancient duplicates that appeared to be derived from a genome duplication event predating the monocot–dicot divergence  <cit> . the same method was used in this study, and we deduced that there were three ancient bdgras genes, bradi1g <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  and bradi1g <dig>  furthermore, all the deduced ancient gras genes were from group iii and contained no segmental or tandem duplication events, implying that these ancient gras genes from three species, over the course of evolution, experienced little or no amplification.

analysis of positive selection and functional divergence
in a gene family, new genes produced by duplication either evolve a new function and are retained because of positive selection or are lost during the course of evolution  <cit> . usually, in the early stages of the evolution of duplicated genes, the genes are not subject to selection pressure  or display traits that subject them to positive selection . in specific functional evolution, every gene has a fixed function, and selection pressure tends to purify selection   <cit> . therefore, it is difficult to observe positive selection pressure when a duplicated gene is very old. in this study, whether the site-specific model or branch-site model was used, no or few significant sites were found in gras subfamilies except group i and group v . it is possible that some ancient gras proteins subject to purifying selection are the dominant evolutionary type, which would partially explain the above result. nevertheless, we detected several caass that were under positive selection pressure. by contrast, ppgras genes experienced a relatively higher positive selection pressure, as they  <dig> positive selection sites, whereas the other five species studied appeared to be more conservative and no positive selection sites were detected. in addition, p. patens had a variety of exon–intron structures and longer sequence outside the gras domain than other species, which strongly supported this view. on the other hand, we detected  <dig> significant sites in group i, suggesting that these amino acid sites may act as a major evolutionary force in group i. moreover, the analysis of functional divergence also supported this hypothesis. the caass were always identified when group i was compared with other groups in type i , strongly suggesting that group i-specific functional evolution of the gras gene is occurring or has occurred. meanwhile,  <dig> caass were detected in group v. it is rather remarkable that the number of group v genes from s. moellendorffii and p. patens reached the maximum in comparison with the other subgroups. furthermore, compared with only three caass for the type i functional divergence, there were  <dig> and  <dig> type ii-related caass were identified for the i/va and i/vb pairs, respectively, which strongly indicated that the physiochemical properties of some ancient amino acids may have changed in evolution, further driving the functional divergence of group i and group v. in addition, we identified twelve sites which were responsible for both functional divergence and positive selection. typically, an amino acid residue is highly conserved in one duplicate gene, but highly variable in the other one  <cit> . so these caass partly reflect the coding regions of gras gene family may have diverged, and these caass may act as a major evolutionary force driving the functional divergence of gras gene family. on the other hand, functional divergence might reflect the existence of long-term selective pressures. especially, significant differences in type-i functional divergence between subfamily pairs indicated that different site-specific shifts in evolutionary rate may have occurred. in short, duplicated genes through long-term selection result in altered functional constraints between the gene clusters of gras gene family.

expression analysis of della proteins
della proteins constitute a subgroup of the gras family of plant-specific proteins. in this paper, we predicted the existence of  <dig> della proteins that mediate the regulation of gene expression by gibberellins, which are involved in the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth  <cit> . previous studies showed that they promote seed germination, leaf expansion, flowering, stem elongation, and flower development. in our expression profiles, rgl <dig>  rgl <dig>  rga, gai were preferentially expressed in flowers, which agrees with results from cao et al. that gibberellin mobilizes distinct della-dependent transcriptomes to regulate floral development in arabidopsis  <cit> . meanwhile, other della proteins  from rice and soybean also showed a high expression level in flower . furthermore, rgl <dig> was preferentially expressed in seed, as were glyma10g <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  glyma04g <dig>  and glyma18g <dig>  however, glyma11g <dig> was preferentially expressed in nodules. these results indicated that the functions of della proteins were relatively conserved, but functional divergence still existed to meet special requirements in different species. gallego-bartolome et al. reported that functional diversification of different della proteins in arabidopsis is the result of subfunctionalization, probably due to changes in the proteins’ regulatory sequences  <cit> . more experiments are needed to reveal different mechanisms of transcription by della proteins in different species.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comparative genomic analysis of the gras gene family in arabidopsis, b. distachyon, rice, soybean, s. moellendorffii, and p. patens, assigning the gras genes to seven major clusters. the results of differential expression of the duplicated gras genes indicated that the proteins’ functions may have diverged to meet the special requirements of different species. the gras family of genes showed different expansion patterns in different species and groups. segmental duplication was the predominant expansion pattern of the gras gene family in soybean, while tandem duplication events played an important role in the expansion of genes in group ii. all putative duplicated genes were identified postdate the monocot–dicot split. furthermore, these genes from group i and group v were under a higher positive selection pressure, which was revealed by the branch-site model. in addition, the site-specific model showed that gras genes experienced a higher positive selection pressure in p. patens than in the other five more conservative species. analyses of functional divergence showed that the caass were always identified when group i was compared with other groups in type i, strongly suggesting that the shifted evolutionary rate may mainly attributed to group i-specific functional evolution. finally, although the predicted  <dig> della proteins were relatively conserved, their functions are diverging according to the expression profiles of the gras family. in short, our analysis provides a solid foundation for further functional dissection of gras genes in plants.
