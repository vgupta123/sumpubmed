BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium frequently associated with nosocomial and community-acquired infections  <cit> . over the past decade, healthcare practitioners have observed the rapid evolution of antimicrobial resistance among k. pneumoniae clinical isolates worldwide. the emergence and subsequent global spread of strains producing klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase  represents a significant threat to public health  <cit> . the gene encoding this β-lactam resistance factor is frequently carried along with genes conferring resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobial agents. as a result, the therapeutic options to treat infections caused by kpc-producing k. pneumoniae are generally scarce and in some instances limited to polymyxins  <cit> .

the development of an effective response against k. pneumoniae infections depends on the integrity of the immune system. indeed, many authors have provided evidence that activation of the inflammatory response is required to clear such infections  <cit> . unfortunately, most patients infected by multidrug-resistant k. pneumoniae have serious underlying conditions and/or a compromised immune status  <cit> . capsule production is believed to be one of the most important virulence factors for this species. the polysaccharide matrix found on its cell surface may prevent desiccation, confer adherence to host cells and protect it against both non-specific and specific host immunity  <cit> . however, there are differences in the degree of virulence conferred by different klebsiella capsule types, possibly depending on the mannose and/or rhamnose content of the cps  <cit> . the k. pneumoniae capsule is generally composed of acidic polysaccharides, including uronic acid repeats and, in several instances, mannose, rhamnose, galactose, pyruvate and fucose residues  <cit> . the genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport and assembly of k. pneumoniae and e. coli group  <dig> capsules are found at a locus called cps, which is organized similarly in the two species  <cit> . the biosynthetic process of both types of capsules is also related between the two bacteria. briefly, cps synthesis initially takes place on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane with the assembly of individual sugar repeat residues which are linked by the sequential activities of specific glycosyltransferases   <cit> . these are then flipped across the inner membrane by the action of the wzx protein and undergo polymerization by the wzy protein  <cit> . polymerization control and translocation of the nascent polymer to the cell surface occurs with the coordinated action of wza, wzb and wzc proteins  <cit> .

to date, a variety of cps gene clusters have been characterized in klebsiella spp., mostly from isolates recovered in the usa, asia and europe  <cit> . to our knowledge, there have been no studies on the cps organization of k. pneumoniae isolates from brazil, kpc-producing or otherwise. here, we report the unique cps organization of a kpc-producing k. pneumoniae isolate showing multidrug resistance. this bacterium was responsible for a large nosocomial outbreak in a teaching hospital located in southern brazil .

RESULTS
general features of the cpskp <dig> gene cluster
the cpskp <dig> gene cluster is  <dig>  kbp in length and contains  <dig> open reading frames  from galf to wzy . the average gc content of these genes is 42%, which is lower than the average gc content of the entire kp <dig> genome . comparable gc content has been reported for twelve other k. pneumoniae cps clusters  <cit> .

the cpskp <dig> has a genomic organization similar to other k. pneumoniae cps clusters, and it can be divided into three regions as shown in figure  <dig>  the 5’ end or region  <dig>  contains conserved genes responsible for polymer assembly and translocation  <cit> . the central region or region  <dig> contains genes encoding serotype-specific gts and gnd. the 3’ end or region  <dig> is more variable among different capsular types, with some containing the mancb operon that encodes gdp-d-mannose, like serotypes k <dig> and k <dig>  <cit> . similarly to serotypes k <dig> and k <dig>  the 3’ end of the cpskp <dig> gene cluster contains the rmlbadc operon for the synthesis of dtdp-l-rhamnose instead of the mancb operon  <cit> . the genes wzx and wzy are also found in the 3’ region of the kp <dig> cps cluster. this region is succeeded by defective is elements and a prophage fragment . the discussed conservation of region  <dig> and variability of region  <dig> can be readily observable on a comparison of the cps loci of different k-types deposited in ncbi .

the cpskp <dig> monosaccharide biosynthesis pathways: udp-d-glucuronate, udp-d-galacturonate and l-rhamnose
as in other bacteria that produce group- <dig> capsules, galf delimits the 5’ region of cpskp <dig>  this gene shows 100% identity to the galf sequence present in k. pneumoniae nk <dig> , which codes for a utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . this enzyme belongs to the nucleotidyltransferase family and catalyzes the reaction utp + α-d-glucose 1-phosphate ↔ diphosphate + udp-d-glucose. this enzyme is important because udp-d-glucose serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and capsular polysaccharides. it is also possible that the galf product interacts with the product of galu, thus elevating udp-d-glucose concentration in the cell and providing more material for the synthesis of capsular polysaccharides  <cit> . in fact, a galu homolog found in kp <dig> outside the cps region  shows 94% identity  to galu from shigella flexneri . immediately downstream of the rmlbadc operon, the gene ugd is found . it encodes a udp-glucose 6-dehydrogenase . as depicted in figure  <dig>  this enzyme converts udp-d-glucose to udp-d-glucuronate, a common constituent of bacterial capsules  <cit> . as with other sequences located in the 3’ region of the cpskp <dig> gene cluster, this coding sequence exhibits remarkable amino acid conservation. it is 100% identical to ugd from k. pneumoniae strains nk <dig>  and vgh <dig> serotype k <dig>  , both studied by shu et al.  <cit> . uge catalyzes the conversion of udp-d-glucuronate to udp-d-galacturonate , which is also present in both bacterial capsules and lps. in fact, kp <dig> has two copies of this gene, uge- <dig>  and uge- <dig> . a nad-dependent epimerase domain  is predicted to occupy amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> in both uge sequences. two copies of uge are also found in the genome of k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis , one in the cps cluster and an inverted adjacent copy in the cluster for lps synthesis  <cit> . as the k <dig> cps contains d-galacturonate in its composition, uge was considered the last gene of its cps cluster  <cit>  instead of ugd as usually regarded  <cit> . in kp <dig> uge- <dig> should also be considered within the cps since the genes necessary to the flippase and polymerase activities, wzx and wzy respectively, are located downstream ; therefore, d-galacturonate could also form the kp <dig> cps composition. the effects of a uge null mutation on colonization and virulence were studied in k. pneumoniae  <dig>  which is a highly virulent strain able to colonize different surfaces  <cit> . a uge deletion reduced colonization and rendered the strain completely avirulent in an experimental model of pneumonia  <cit> . this suggests that the uge- <dig> and/or uge- <dig> mutation in kp <dig> could have important, measurable effects on colonization and virulence.

in the cpskp <dig> cluster, genes encoding enzymes that participate on the synthesis of dtdp-l-rhamnose from glucose 1-phosphate are found immediately downstream of the gnd gene . the rmlbadc genes were found in three capsular serotypes studied by shu et al.  <cit> : k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig>  in serotypes k <dig> and k <dig>  these genes are also found downstream of gnd. the lengths of the products encoded by rmla, rmlb, rmlc and rmld are shown in table  <dig>  along with the best blast hits for these genes. the gene rmla codes for a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase , which catalyzes the first reaction of l-rhamnose synthesis: dttp + α-d-glucose 1-phosphate → diphosphate + dtdp-d-glucose . the second reaction is performed by dtdp-d-glucose  <dig> -dehydratase , the product of rmlb, which catalyzes the dehydration of dtdp-d-glucose to dtdp-4-keto 6-deoxy-d-glucose. epimerization at the c3’ and c5’ positions of this molecule is performed by dtdp-4-dehydrorhamnose  <dig> -epimerase , producing dtdp-4-oxo-l-rhamnose. finally, dtdp-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase , encoded by rmld, catalyzes the reduction of dtdp-4-oxo-l-rhamnose to dtdp-l-rhamnose, which can be subsequently linked to the capsular polymer by a specific rhamnosyltransferase. all three conserved regions  discussed by giraud and naismith  <cit>  are present in kp13’s rmld.

whereas the chemical composition of the kp <dig> capsule remains to be determined, the pyrosequencing-based genomic analysis of cpskp <dig> allowed the identification of sugar metabolic pathways. genes encoding enzymes for the biosynthesis of sugar nucleotide precursors in the kp <dig> capsule, such as udp-d-glucose, udp-d-glucuronate, udp-d-galacturonate and dtdp-l-rhamnose, are found in the cps cluster. thus, the capsule of kp <dig> may contain any of these sugar nucleotide precursors. in particular, the presence of two genes in the cps cluster encoding possible rhamnosyltransferases suggests that l-rhamnose makes up part of the kp <dig> capsule . on the other hand, gale  was identified outside the cps region, and it encodes a udp-glucose 4-epimerase with roles in the amino sugar and nucleotide sugar pathways producing udp-d-galactose from udp-d-glucose . the presence of this gene suggests that the capsule composition of kp <dig> could also include udp-d-galactose derivatives. neither the mana, manb and manc genes of the cps cluster nor other genes of the mannose and fucose biosynthesis pathways were identified in the kp <dig> genome. this suggests that the cps of kp <dig> does not contain gdp-d-mannose or gdp-l-fucose derivatives.

proteins involved in translocation, surface assembly and polymerization: wzi, wza, wzb, wzc, wzx and wzy
the deduced amino acid sequences of the wzi and wza genes found in cpskp <dig> show 98% and 97% identity, respectively, with homologs from k. pneumoniae vgh <dig> , and both proteins were predicted to localize in the outer membrane . moreover, a signal peptide was predicted for the wzi gene product. analysis of the secondary structure of the kp <dig> wzi protein using psipred showed that it is rich in β-sheet regions , an observation that has been experimentally confirmed for a wzi homolog in e. coli   <cit>  which shares 98% identity with that of kp <dig>  also, rahn et al.  <cit>  established the importance of the wzi outer membrane protein for capsule synthesis by showing that wzi mutants have lower amounts of cell-associated capsular polysaccharide.

the wza product of kp <dig> has 92% identity with wza from e. coli , which has been shown to be an integral lipoprotein with exposed regions on the cell surface. the e. coli protein forms a ring-like structure responsible for polymer translocation through the outer membrane  <cit> . wzc and wzb are a tyrosine autokinase and its cognate acid phosphatase, respectively, and they are ubiquitously found in group  <dig> capsule clusters  <cit> . the kp <dig> wzc protein was predicted to have two transmembrane regions, like its counterpart in the k. pneumoniae strain chedid, with which it shares 72% amino acid identity . the inner membrane is the probable location of kp13’ wzc , in agreement with its role in capsule synthesis. wzc is involved in the translocation of capsular polysaccharide from the periplasm to the cellular surface through formation of a complex with wza  <cit> . wzc undergoes autophosphorylation of its tyrosine-rich c-terminal residues  potentially modulating the opening and closing of the translocation channel  <cit> . the wzb protein  of kp <dig> is probably located in the cytoplasm . wzb catalyzes the removal of a phosphate group from phosphorylated wzc and is necessary for continued polymerization of the repeat units  <cit> . sequence conservation of the wzy and wzx proteins is usually low  <cit> . the localization of wzx and wzy in kp <dig> is different from that observed in various k-serotypes by shu et al.  <cit> , in which the genes usually mapped upstream of gnd. in kp <dig>  both genes are located downstream of gnd, in region  <dig> of the cps cluster, and wzy is transcribed in the opposite direction relative to other cps genes. wzx is an inner membrane protein that transfers the polysaccharide units, assembled in the cytoplasm, into the periplasm, thus acting as a flippase  <cit> . the wzx protein from cpskp <dig> has  <dig> predicted transmembrane segments and is  <dig> aa long, which is in agreement with a previous study of this protein in e. coli that predicted 10– <dig> transmembrane segments  <cit> . blastp against the ncbi database shows that the best hit  is a putative wzx protein from e. coli ta <dig> . a polysaccharide biosynthesis domain , common to wzx proteins, was found spanning amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> of kp <dig> wzx.

wzy from kp <dig> is  <dig> aa long and also had  <dig> predicted transmembrane segments, similar to the wzy proteins of other enterobacteriaceae that have 10– <dig> transmembrane segments  <cit> . this protein is believed to be a polysaccharide polymerase, although experimental evidence for this activity has not yet been reported due to the technical difficulty of working with wzy in vitro  <cit> . ncbi blastp searches show that the best hit  for wzy is a conserved protein from thermoanaerobacter wiegelii  .

it is remarkable that the wzy gene from isolate kp <dig> is transcribed in the opposite direction compared to other genes of the cps cluster, a characteristic that to our knowledge has not been reported for previously studied cps clusters, as can be observed in figure  <dig>  where the position of wzy within different k. pneumoniae cps loci is highlighted.

downstream wzy, we have identified an 862-bp region showing 70% identity to an is element of the is <dig> family . no terminal inverted repeats or target site duplications were found in this element. although three orfs identified within this putative is showed significant identity to distinct transposases, these structures do not seem to encode functional enzymes. the occurrence of mutations leading to premature stop codons and/or frameshifts might have rendered this transposase non-functional. alternatively, this chimeric structure could have resulted from homologous recombination events with other transposase-encoding genes. upstream wzy, there is a 1539-bp orf whose deduced amino acid sequence shows 31% identity to a defective tail fiber protein of a mu-like prophage identified in dickeya dadantii . notably, other prophage genes were absent. the location of wzy between two defective mobile genetic elements suggests that this gene may have been incorporated into kp13’s cps via an ancient horizontal gene transfer event. subsequently, these mobile genetic elements may have been truncated in order to assure that wzy would be permanently present in the cpskp <dig> region, which is desirable because capsule assembly is a wzy-dependent process.

the conserved gene gnd, found in the central region of cpskp <dig>  encodes a  <dig> aa protein  that catalyzes the conversion of 6-phospho-d-gluconate to d-ribulose 5-phosphate during the third step of the pentose phosphate pathway. this gene was found in all of the cps gene clusters studied by shu et al.  <cit>  and shows a high degree of conservation among them, which would be expected from an evolutionary standpoint due to the central role of this metabolic pathway. at the protein sequence level, the best hit  for kp13’s gnd product is an ortholog from strain vgh <dig>  serotype k <dig>  .

kp13’s cps gene cluster has five gts: wbap, orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf19
the products of wbap, orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig> are gts, enzymes specialized on the polymerization of sugar molecules into existing molecules, which can be carbohydrates, lipids or proteins. because of the variety of modifications catalyzed by gts it is difficult, based on sequence analysis alone, to define the exact outcome of each reaction  <cit> , even though they may play an important part on the diversity of capsular structures encountered in k. pneumoniae. the number of gts in k. pneumoniae’s cps cluster is variable, ranging from three  to six as reported by shu et al.  <cit> . kp <dig> has a total of five gts, four of these located contiguously  and one of them found on the 3’ end of the cluster . all the gts found on kp13’s cps gene cluster have been predicted to belong to the family  <dig> gts, comprising enzymes that use an inverting catalytic mechanism which modifies the anomeric configuration of the transferred sugar  <cit> . wbap  is the first gt on kp13’s cps gene cluster and encodes a  <dig> aa long udp-gal::undecaprenolphosphate gal-1-p transferase, which catalyzes the initial transfer of galactose-1-phosphate to an undecaprenol phosphate acceptor, thus initiating the capsule polymer synthesis. this protein was predicted to be located in the cytoplasmic membrane  and may contain five transmembrane-spanning regions. a conserved wbap phosphotransferase domain  is also found ranging from amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  ncbi blastp searches showed identity of up to 80% with wbap from other k. pneumoniae and e. coli. the protein presents two conserved dxd motifs, which are widespread in gts and are thought to be involved in metal/nucleotide binding and catalysis  <cit> : ded, ranging from amino acids 356– <dig> and dvd, 442– <dig> aa. the latter has been found in all but one of  <dig> different capsular serotypes studied by shu et al.  <cit> . orf <dig>  encodes a  <dig> aa uncharacterized gt whose amino acid sequence shows 67% identity  with putative rhamnosyltransferases from k. pneumoniae strain a <dig> showing a unique capsular serotype   <cit> . the gt encoded by orf <dig>  is predicted to be  <dig> aa long, with a best hit on ncbi blastp with a putative dtdp-rhamnosyltransferase from d. dadantii  . d. dadantii is a distantly related plant pathogen of the enterobacteriaceae family. interestingly, there is little similarity between orf <dig> and other k. pneumoniae sequences. the highest identity match  is with a putative rhamnosyltransferase from strain vgh <dig> . the presence of the rmlbadc genes  together with the possible rhamnosyltransferases provides appealing evidence that l-rhamnose makes part of kp13’s capsular structure. orf <dig>  the third gene encoding a putative gt located in region  <dig> of the kp <dig> cps cluster, is predicted to code for a  <dig> aa long protein with a conserved domain of unknown function spanning amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> . as with orf <dig>  the best hit  is also with a sequence encoding a putative gt from d. dadantii . there was no similarity between the orf <dig>  product and other published klebsiella sequences.

finally, the last gt from cpskp <dig>  termed orf <dig>  is located on the 3’ end of the cps cluster and encodes a predicted  <dig> aa product. this protein has similarity with several uncharacterized gts family  <dig> from different enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli ta <dig>  , d. dadantii   and cronobacter sakazakii  . only a general domain of the gts family  <dig> was found in this protein, spanning amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> .

in silico serotyping
using molecular serotyping for the cps cluster, brisse et al.  <cit>  showed that very distinct pcr-rflp patterns  were obtained for most of the k serotypes, indicating that differences in antigenic specificity among serotypes are due to differences in cps gene content. thus, we have also applied in silico molecular serotyping to determine the capsular serotype of isolate kp <dig>  for this approach, the sequence between the primers published by brisse et al.  <cit>  was used to search in silico for restriction sites of the hincii endonuclease. this sequence spanned  <dig>  bp from wzi to gnd, and the in silico restriction analysis identified  <dig> restriction sites, corresponding to  <dig> restriction fragments . the fragments, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, were selected for analysis as suggested by brisse et al.  <cit>  . the cpskp <dig> rflp pattern was compared to  <dig> previously published c patterns  <cit> . none of the reference patterns matched the one displayed by kp <dig> . the similarity score for kp <dig> was greater than  <dig>  , thus providing additional evidence that kp <dig> k-type is a new serotype.

* fragments used for this analysis are underlined.

in vitro k-serotyping
kp <dig> showed a weak positive reaction with both k <dig> and k <dig> antisera that could not be resolved by modifying antiserum dilution or quellung reaction. this result is not surprising since cross-reactions with the type-specific antisera is commonly observed among k. pneumoniae clinical isolates due to the activity of common genetic elements among distinct cps clusters  <cit> . in fact, the rmlbadc genes are also present in the cps cluster displayed by serotype k <dig>  <cit> , and its cps is composed of d-glucuronate, d-galactose and l-rhamnose residues  <cit> . given the gene content of cpskp <dig> and the presence of gale on the kp <dig> genome, these residues could all be synthesized by this isolate, hence cross-reactions were not unexpected. from the comparison of cpskp <dig> and cpsvgh <dig>  it is clear that they have common genes, but the kp <dig> cps also has distinguishing features like its repertoire of gts, the presence of uge- <dig> and a different cluster organization . in the same line of evidence, the cps of serotype k <dig> is composed of l-rhamnose, d-glucose and d-galacturonate residues  <cit> , all of which also potentially present in the kp <dig> cps as discussed earlier, and d-galacturonate being produced by the epimerase activity from the uge- <dig> product. no cps sequences from k <dig> isolates were found on public databases. nevertheless, our results indicate that kp <dig> possess a unique serotype since it showed a distinct rflp pattern compared to those  <dig> patterns, including representatives of serotypes k <dig> and k <dig>  previously described  <cit> . it has also been observed that cps-pcr genotyping seems to be a more sensitive and specific way for detecting novel serotypes  <cit> , and our pyrosequencing-based approach together with the careful scrutinization of each cds in the cluster and the in vitro results supports the finding that kp <dig> synthesizes a novel cps.

regulation of cps gene expression in kp13
the transcriptional regulation of cps genes is thought to be under the control of three promoters, p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  which are located upstream of galf, wzi and rmlb, respectively  <cit> . as previously shown for other strains by shu et al.  <cit> , in the cpskp <dig> cluster the transcripts driven by p <dig> and p <dig> should consist of galf/orf <dig> and wzi to gnd, respectively . regulatory elements have been identified within the promoters p <dig> and p <dig> of the cpskp <dig> cluster. promoter p <dig> contains the regulatory rcsab box operator  that is essential for the induction of rcs-regulated promoters by way of its interaction with the regulators rcsb and rcsa  <cit> . predicted rcsb and rcsa genes are present in the kp <dig> genome, encoded, respectively, by predicted coding sequences kp <dig> and kp <dig> 

the jumpstart element was found within promoter p <dig> . this element was identified upstream of a number of bacterial cps clusters  <cit> . the 8-bp ops element  is located within jumpstart and has been reported to function as a binding site for the rfah activator protein  <cit> . indeed, rfah is found elsewhere in the kp <dig> genome , and its deduced amino acid sequence displays 80% identity with an ortholog from e. coli k <dig> . a possible stem-loop structure  related to the rho-independent transcription attenuator is located in the intergenic region between wzc and wbap of the cpskp <dig> cluster, as predicted by the arnold web server  <cit>  with a calculated free energy of − <dig>  kcal/mol. similar features have also been identified in other cps clusters from k. pneumoniae <cit> . additionally, a second putative stem-loop structure  was predicted downstream of orf <dig> . further studies are necessary to confirm the implications of this finding; a stem-loop in this position has not been previously described. the transcription of cpskp <dig> region  <dig> may occur from different promoters. for instance, the p <dig> promoter upstream rmlb may transcribe a polycistronic mrna from this gene up to orf <dig> or, alternatively, each individual promoter predicted in this region may drive the transcription of a limited number of genes .

notably, wzy is located between defective mobile elements and is transcribed in the opposite direction of other genes in the cps cluster . thus, it should have its own promoter . a putative − <dig> box was found, separated by 15 bp from its − <dig> counterpart, but no obvious rbs could be identified. this observation raises the question of how kp <dig> coordinates expression of wzy, since this protein is also essential for the formation of cps.

deviations from the − <dig> and − <dig> consensus sequences significantly modify the strength of each promoter  <cit> , so the number of promoters could in fact be different from that proposed here. still, their roles in cps cluster regulation deserve further experimental study, and our sequence-based bioinformatic approach provides candidates for follow-up.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report a unique cps cluster organization in kp <dig>  a multidrug-resistant, kpc-producing k. pneumoniae strain that caused a large outbreak in a brazilian teaching hospital. the kp <dig> cps cluster contains all of the genes necessary for capsule biosynthesis. based on the sugar metabolic pathways identified in cpskp <dig> and in other genomic regions, we have predicted that the capsule composition of kp <dig> may include d-glucose, d-glucuronate, d-galacturonate, d-galactose and l-rhamnose residues.
