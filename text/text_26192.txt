BACKGROUND
metabolic bone disorders are often a cause of bone fragility and increased risk of fracture. a common example of a bone metabolic disorder in humans is osteoporosis; a late-onset disease characterized by low bone mineral density, structural deterioration of bone tissue and an elevated risk of fracture in affected individuals. bone fragility has an estimated heritability of 16-54%  <cit>  in humans, depending on fracture site and type, and several genes associated with bone mineral density and fracture risk have been identified in both humans and other species  <cit> , although the genes underlying each of these traits appear to be different  <cit> .

bone fractures with non-traumatic origin occur in thoroughbred racehorses, with the majority of fractures occurring in the distal limbs; bones subject to high impact and load during exercise and racing. fracture is the main reason for euthanasia of horses on the racecourse  <cit> , with an average of  <dig> horses per year suffering a fatal distal limb fracture during racing in the uk   <cit> . the prevalence of all fatal and non-fatal fractures occurring during training is between 10-20%  <cit> . studies of the pathology of equine fracture indicate evidence of stress-related damage to the bone prior to fracture, which may be related to metabolic disturbances in bone re-modelling  <cit> .

fracture risk has been demonstrated to be heritable in several species but its heritability in the horse has not been previously investigated. in this study, we have identified candidate genome regions associated with fracture risk in the thoroughbred horse by carrying out a genome-wide association study  with  <dig>  snps genotyped on  <dig> fracture cases and  <dig> controls. we have also demonstrated that there is significant genetic variation for fracture risk in the thoroughbred horse, distributed among several chromosomes.

methods
data
fracture cases were horses that sustained catastrophic distal limb fractures while racing on uk racecourses, which necessitated euthanasia. a total of  <dig> fracture case samples were obtained from an archive of bone and tissue collected during a previous study between february  <dig> and may  <dig>  <cit> . the exact fracture site and type were identified by post-mortem examination. the frequency of fracture locations is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  all fracture sites were in bones below and including the knee and hock. no cases with fractures in other bones, for example, the pelvis, neck or skull, were included in the study. the phenotype can, therefore, be regarded as a sub-set of fracture types involving only the distal limbs. control samples  came from a mixture of uninjured horses originally selected from the same race as the case  and uninjured horses sampled as part of a previous study . control horses were over 4 years of age, were racing during the same time period as the cases, and had no history of fracture at the time the study was carried out. after genotyping quality control  <dig> horses remained in the analysis. horses were bred for both flat and national hunt  jump racing: of the cases  <dig> were flat-bred,  <dig> nh-bred and  <dig> of unknown status, of the controls  <dig> were flat-bred,  <dig> nh-bred and  <dig> of unknown status . horse identities were anonymised, and no pedigree information was available.

the numbers of cases and controls shown are for samples which passed genotyping quality control.

dna extraction and quantification
samples consisted of either tissue or bone marrow biopsies  or blood samples collected in edta . dna was extracted using nucleon bacc dna extraction kits by gen-probe life sciences ltd. dna samples were quantified in duplicate using quant_it picogreen dsdna kits  and 10% of the samples were run on a 1% agarose gel to check for the presence of high molecular weight dna. dna aliquots were adjusted to a concentration of 70 ng/ul for genotyping.

snp genotyping and quality control
samples were genotyped with the equine snp <dig> beadchip  by cambridge genomic services . the equine snp <dig> beadchip contains  <dig>  snp assays  selected from the database of over one million snps generated during the sequencing of the horse genome . the initial association results indicated a genome-wide significant region on eca  <dig>  in order to try to refine the position  the location of the associated gene, an additional  <dig> snps located on eca  <dig> between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb , and not present on the beadchip, were genotyped using a goldengate assay  by gen-probe life sciences ltd.

the genotyping data were analysed with genomestudio software . a cluster file was generated directly from the fracture dataset  together with an additional  <dig> thoroughbred samples genotyped at the same time. all genotyping data were clustered de novo for the  <dig>  samples. the average snp call frequency was  <dig> %, with  <dig> snps not called. nineteen samples  had a call rate less than 95% and these were discarded. the remaining samples were then re-clustered. the average snp call frequency had increased to  <dig> %, with only  <dig> snps  not called from the  <dig>  on the equinesnp <dig> beadchip.

all snps were then subjected to a number of editing steps with genomestudio software, during which thresholds were applied for a number of metrics following the chip manufacturer’s guidelines. this resulted in the removal of  <dig> snps with low intensity data ,  <dig>  snps with inadequately defined clusters ,  <dig>  snps with call rates less than 98%,  <dig> snps where the heterozygote cluster was not well separated from the homozygote clusters ,  <dig> snps where genotypes differ significantly from hardy-weinberg equilibrium and  <dig> snps where x chromosome snps were heterozygous in males. a total of  <dig>  snps were removed. the mean call frequency in the remaining snps was  <dig> %. markers with a minor allele frequency  less than 2% were excluded from the analysis , as were markers that failed the hardy-weinberg equilibrium test  , and markers with more than 10% of genotypes missing :  <dig>  snps remained in the analysis.

further quality control procedures on the samples, such as estimation of sample gender based on x chromosome genotypes and identification of duplicated samples based on genotype identity, resulted in  <dig> samples out of  <dig>  being discarded. from the fracture study samples  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls passed the quality control procedures and  <dig> cases and  <dig> control samples failed.

statistical analyses
population stratification
possible population stratification was assessed by calculating identity-by-state  sharing among all pairs of individuals. a permutation test for between group ibs differences  showed a significant  degree of similarity  between cases and controls. there was also significant ibs between flat-bred and national hunt-bred horses , with evidence for more similarity within the flat-bred and national hunt-bred groups than between the groups . these results suggest that both the cases and controls are drawn from genetically related populations. similarly flat-bred and national hunt-bred horses are from related populations, although there is some clustering  within the flat and national hunt populations. additional file 3: figure s <dig> shows multi-dimensional scaling plots based on ibs sharing between cases and controls, and flat-bred and national hunt-bred horses. cases and controls are evenly distributed through both the flat and national hunt-bred populations.

whole genome cochran-mantel-haenszel  association
the cochran-mantel-haenszel  association test  in plink v <dig>   <cit>  was used in order to correct for the potential confounding of population stratification . the cmh association test allows for comparison of cases and controls while controlling for clusters within the data, where the clusters are defined by ibs sharing among individuals . the cmh analysis tests each single snp independently. empirical p-values were calculated using  <dig>  permutations with the adaptive permutation option in plink v <dig>   <cit> .

haplotype logistic regression analysis of eca 18
haplotype blocks in the region of interest on eca  <dig> were identified based on the value of r <dig> and visualized using haploview  <cit> . blocks containing significant snps were further analysed using haplotype logistic regression with plink v <dig> , with sex and background  fitted as co-variates. corrected p-values for the logistic regressions were obtained with  <dig>  permutations. haplotype frequencies within case and control groups were also determined.

estimation of the genetic variance due to snps
estimates of the genetic variance explained by all snps and by snps on individual chromosomes were obtained with restricted maximum likelihood  analysis using the gcta program  <cit> . gcta allows the proportion of variance explained by snps to be estimated for a complex disease based on case-control genome-wide association study  data  <cit> . the method takes account of the binary  nature of case-control data and estimates the genetic variance on the, more interpretable, underlying liability scale. it also takes account of the bias in ascertainment, due to the proportion of cases being larger than the disease prevalence in the population.

a genetic relationship matrix was derived with gcta  <cit>  from the  <dig>  genotyped snps. sex was fitted as a fixed effect, as it had previously been determined to be a significant effect with an anova analysis. gcta accounts for relationships among individuals through the genetic relationship matrix, but also permits principal component analysis  eigenvectors to be included as covariates to capture variance due to population structure. in this analysis the first  <dig> eigenvectors were included as co-variates, in order to account for the structure of the flat and national hunt-bred populations.

RESULTS
population stratification
ibs sharing among individuals indicated there was some genetic differentiation between the flat and national hunt-bred horses, with clustering of families within the groups . pedigree analysis of  <dig> leading  flat and nh sires in the uk in  <dig> showed the mean coancestry among the sires was  <dig> , minimum  <dig>  and maximum  <dig> . this confirms the existence of gene flow or shared ancestry between the groups. a multidimensional scaling plot derived from the pedigree-based coancestry  shows a similar pattern to the dna-based ibs sharing; there is family clustering within nh or flat-bred groups, but also evidence for some differentiation between the family lines used to produce flat or nh horses. in addition to genetic differences between the populations there are also differences in the environmental risks experienced. the risk of fracture depends on the type of racing: flat turf racing is the safest  whilst national hunt racing is associated with the highest risk   <cit> . the increase in environmental risk for national hunt racehorses could make the ascertainment of genetically susceptible horses from this population more difficult, potentially decreasing the power of a genetic study.

prior to correction for population stratification the genomic inflation factor  for the genome-wide association study was  <dig> , and after correction with the cmh test λ was  <dig> . additional file 4: figure s <dig> shows the quantile-quantile  plot obtained after the cmh analysis. the reduction in λ suggests the cmh analysis is effectively accounting for population structure within the data. inclusion of background  into a genome-wide logistic regression model gave a genomic inflation factor  of  <dig> , also suggesting this classification of horses and its inclusion as a co-variate in the analysis corrects sufficiently for population stratification. classification of background  as a fixed effect in the logistic model is simpler than including pca eigenvectors or cmh clusters where there are many levels , and thus permits large numbers of permutations to be computed in a reasonable time-frame.

genome-wide association study
three snps on eca  <dig> and one on eca  <dig>  reached genome-wide significance after correction for multiple testing  table  <dig>  eca  <dig> showed evidence for more than one snp associated with distal limb fracture. a number of supporting snps are seen, with the peak localizing to around 62 mb. there is also evidence of suggestive signals seen on eca  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> although they do not reach genome-wide significance level. figure  <dig> shows manhattan plots of  the raw p-values from the genome-wide association  scan for distal limb fracture  empirical p-values, calculated after  <dig> permutations  empirical p-values for eca  <dig>  the additional  <dig> snps on eca  <dig>  genotyped for fine mapping purposes, showed no significant associations with fracture risk and did not explain any more of the genetic variation in the heritability analysis than the snps included on the equine snp <dig> beadchip.

linkage disequilibrium and haplotype-block analysis
examination of the linkage disequilibrium  among snps showed that the most significant snps on eca  <dig> fall into an ld block containing  <dig> snps in total and spanning 140 kb . all snps within the block are in high ld with each other with pair-wise r <dig> of at least  <dig> . the haplotype ggaggctaaa is at higher frequency in the controls and has a protective effect, with logistic regression  showing that controls are  <dig>  times at less risk of fracture than cases . tggaattaag, a risk haplotype, is at low frequency in the cases and, at least in this data set, absent from the controls. cases with this haplotype are at  <dig>  times higher risk of fracture than controls .

background of horse  and sex were fitted as covariates in the haplotype logistic regression option in plink, p-values were derived using  <dig>  permutations.

there is low ld  between adjacent haplotype blocks in the eca  <dig> region. haplotype block  <dig> contains  <dig>  kb of the zinc finger protein 804a gene  and the two most significant snps in the gwas are located in this haplotype block,  <dig>  kb from the end of the gene. znf804a has been reported to have a variant associated with schizophrenia in humans  <cit> , and regulates expression of genes such as the catechol o-methyl transferase gene   <cit>  which has been associated with increased fracture risk in males  <cit> . an elevated risk of fracture has been noted in schizophrenics  <cit> , but no genes directly associated with fracture risk in schizophrenics have previously been reported.

other candidate genes in eca  <dig> haplotype block  <dig> are integrin alpha-v , a receptor binding to a variety of extracellular matrix proteins including osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, the calcitonin receptor-like gene , collagen type iii alpha  <dig> , collagen type iii alpha  <dig> , and collagen type v alpha  <dig> . ld between eca  <dig> haplotype blocks  <dig> and  <dig> is generally low , apart from snps biec2- <dig> and biec2- <dig> which are in moderate ld  with snps in block  <dig>  the ld observed may have arisen due to a combination of selected alleles at different genes in this region. for example, there is evidence that racing performance and optimal racing distance in the thoroughbred horse is influenced by the nearby myostatin  locus  <cit>  and the extent of ld observed in this region may be the result of a selective sweep  <cit> .

genetic variance explained by snps
genetic variance explained by snps for fracture risk was estimated to be  <dig>  . a log-likelihood of  <dig>  for the full model compared with a log-likelihood of  <dig>  for the null model  and likelihood ratio test  of  <dig>   confirms the variance is significantly different from zero. genetic variance estimates for each individual chromosome showed significant variance on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> accounted for the largest genetic variance, around  <dig> , followed by chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  together these chromosomes account for  <dig> % of the total estimated genetic variance.

the highest individual chromosome genetic variance estimates correspond with some, but not all, of the chromosomes identified as showing significant association with fracture risk in the genome-wide association study . reml analysis to estimate the genetic variances accounts for both genetic relatedness among individuals, through the snp-based genetic relationship matrix, and population structure  <cit> . in contrast, association methods rely on individuals being unrelated and where there is cryptic relatedness among individuals this can result in an inflation of type i errors or false positives. we have used both approaches in this study, giving increased confidence in chromosomes where the results are concordant. gwas methods are conservative in their approach, as stringent significance thresholds must be reached before a result is declared significant. large sample sizes are generally required  before these significance thresholds are reached. snps that do not reach the significance threshold for a gwas may, nevertheless, still have genetic effects on the disease. whether or not they reach the significance threshold depends on the size of the allele effect, the allele frequencies and the degree of linkage disequilibrium between the snps and the causal mutations.

CONCLUSIONS
significant genetic variation for fracture risk in the thoroughbred horse was detected on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> using reml analysis. in a related genome-wide association study snps on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> reached genome-wide significance. several plausible candidate genes involved in bone development are located in these regions. however, the identification of further candidate regions for fracture risk is likely to require larger sample sizes. this study has demonstrated that fracture risk in the horse is heritable and that there is the potential to develop snp-based estimators for genetic risk of fracture in the thoroughbred racehorse.
