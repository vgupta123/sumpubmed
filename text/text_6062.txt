BACKGROUND
microarrays  <cit>  are routinely used for the quantitative measurement of gene expression levels on a genome-wide scale. microarray experiments are complicated multiple step procedures and variability can be introduced in every step, so that the resulting data are often very noisy, especially for weakly expressed genes. appropriate statistical analysis of this noisy data is very important in order to obtain meaningful biological information  <cit> . the analysis of microarray data is usually performed in multiple stages, including probe-level analysis, normalisation and higher level analyses. the aim of the probe-level analysis is to obtain reliable gene expression measurements from the image data. various higher level analyses, such as detecting differential gene expression or clustering, can then be carried out depending on the biological aims of the experiment.

unsupervised clustering is the most frequently used approach for exploring gene function. by clustering, a huge number of genes can be organised into a much smaller number of categories according to their shared expression patterns. it is hoped that these shared patterns reflect similar function or common transcriptional regulation. exploring and studying the obtained gene clusters is an important way to infer the function of uncharacterised genes from other known genes in the same cluster. there are many unsupervised algorithms which have been used to cluster gene expression data, including the most popular hierarchical clustering  <cit>  and k-means  <cit> , which are based on similarity measures, and self-organising maps  <cit> . most of these conventional algorithms are largely heuristically motivated. they are easily implemented and their application is usually computationally efficient. however, these methods lack the capability to deal in a principled way with the experimental variability in the gene expression data. furthermore, there is no formal way to determine the number of clusters with these algorithms. it is hard to say which one is generally better than the others  <cit> . probabilistic models provide a principled alternative to these conventional methods. in particular, model-based approaches have been proposed as useful methods for clustering gene expression data in a probabilistic way  <cit> . by using a probabilistic model, the experimental noise can be included explicitly in the model and estimated from the data, making this approach more robust to noise. there are also useful and principled model selection methods that can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters. the advantages of model-based probabilistic approaches over heuristic methods are already well established  <cit> .

affymetrix arrays contain multiple probes for each target gene and this internal replication can be used to obtain an estimate of the technical measurement error associated with each gene expression measurement  <cit> . this source of error is especially significant for weakly expressed genes. the recently developed model, multi-mgmos  <cit> , provides accurate gene expression measurements along with the associated uncertainty in this measurement. it has been shown that the probe-level measurement error obtained from multi-mgmos can be propagated through a downstream probabilistic analysis, thereby improving the performance of the analysis  <cit> . existing model-based clustering methods do not consider this probe-level measurement error and they therefore discard this rich source of information about variability. although standard model-based clustering methods are relatively robust to noise, very noisy measurements can still have a detrimental effect on these clustering methods, resulting in poor performance and many biologically irrelevant clusters. in this paper, we aim to include information about probe-level measurement error into the standard gaussian mixture model in order to improve performance compared to standard model-based clustering. our augmented gaussian mixture clustering model is called puma-clust  and has been implemented in the r-package pumaclust which is available from  <cit> .

RESULTS
we examine the performance of the extended gaussian mixture model on two simulated datasets and a real-world mouse time-course dataset  <cit> . the simulated datasets are generated to reflect the noise commonly seen in real microarray experiments. the extended mixture model is compared with the standard gaussian mixture models implemented in mclust  <cit> , which includes all variants of standard gaussian mixture models in terms of the representation of the covariance matrix. however, these models do not take the probe-level measurement error into consideration.

the performance of different clustering methods on datasets with known structures can be evaluated by using the adjusted rand index  <cit> . the adjusted rand index measures the similarity of two clusterings on a dataset and it is widely used by the clustering research community  <cit> . the adjusted rand index lies between  <dig> and  <dig>  and is calculated based on whether pairs are placed in the same or different clusters in two partitions with a higher value meaning better agreement between two clusterings. for the simulated datasets, since the true structure of the data is known, we use the adjusted rand index to evaluate the different partitioning ability of the extended mixture model which incorporates the probe-level measurement error and the standard mixture model. for the real mouse time-course dataset, gene ontology  enrichment analysis is used to compare the performance of the two clustering methods.

clustering on simulated data sets
simulated periodic data
periodic patterns are often observed in real-world time-course microarray data  <cit> . however, the true structure of the real datasets is unavailable. we generate simulated periodic data and include noise with magnitude estimated from real microarray data. similar to the methods used by  <cit>  and  <cit> , the simulated data is generated by the following four steps.

at the first step, the logged gene expression within each known group is generated. there are six groups and  <dig> genes in the dataset. each group has  <dig> genes. the first four groups have a periodic sine pattern. the expression of gene i in group q, q =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  is generated by

xqij = ai sin + s,     

where j =  <dig>   <dig> ..., j and j is the number of conditions or time points. ai is a random scaling factor which is sampled from u, where u represents the uniform distribution. s is a shifting factor which is set as  <dig>  this assignment of ai and s is to make the gene expression level lie between  <dig> and  <dig> which is the normal range of the logged gene expression level from real affymetrix datasets. the gene expression levels of group  <dig> and group  <dig> are generated by linear functions

xqij = jaqi/j and xqij = -jaqi/j + s,     

respectively, where aqi is sampled from u  and s =  <dig> when q =  <dig> so as to ensure that the simulated expression level lies within the accepted logged expression range.

the simulated data from the first step follows perfectly the same sine wave within the same group except for a different magnitude. however, in practice there is biological and technical noise in the experiment distorting the true sine wave. at the second step, the real mouse dataset  is used to obtain an estimate of the combined noise from biological and technical sources which is related to the variance of observed gene expression level from replicated experiments. the mouse dataset has three or four replicates for each condition. using the gene expression summaries from mas  <dig>   <cit>  which is the standard software provided by affymetrix, an estimate of the combined technical and biological noise can be obtained from cyber-t  <cit> . cyber-t is a bayesian hierarchical model which calculates the variance between replicates using point estimates of gene expression level from each replicate. since the variance has a dependence on gene expression level, the combined noise, σqij2

at the third step, in order to show the clustering improvement by including probe-level measurement error, we sample the corresponding probe-level variance of the simulated expression level from the real mouse dataset processed by multi-mgmos. similar to the second step, since the measurement error has a dependence on the gene expression level, the standard deviation for each simulated expression value, σ^

since the true partition of the simulated dataset is known, the agreement of the clustering results from different methods with the true partition can be assessed by the adjusted rand index. the true number of groups, six, is selected for both mclust and puma-clust. three sets of datasets are generated to evaluate the different performance of puma-clust and mclust with number of conditions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for each set,  <dig> random simulated datasets are generated. the average adjusted rand index from puma-clust and mclust are shown in the first column of figure  <dig>  for the three sets of simulated datasets, puma-clust results in markedly better performance compared with mclust and the p-values of a paired t-test, shown in table  <dig>  indicate that the difference in performance is highly significant.

including a noise group
in a real-world microarray dataset, there are usually a certain fraction of genes whose expression levels are indistinguishable from random noise. these genes do not belong to any pattern group in the dataset  <cit> .

to assess the performance of puma-clust on this kind of dataset, we add a group of random noise genes into the previously simulated datasets. the first generating step of the gene expression level for group seven is

xqij = aqi,     

where aqi is sampled from u. the following steps of the simulation are the same as those for the former six groups. three sets of simulated datasets with  <dig> randomly generated datasets for each set are also sampled and the average adjusted rand index for three cases with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> conditions are shown in the second column of figure  <dig>  the number of groups for both mclust and puma-clust is assigned to seven. from the three plots it can be seen that the performance of the clustering from both puma-clust and mclust decreases with the inclusion of the noise group, but puma-clust still outperforms mclust over all three noise levels with the three different data dimensions. the p-values in table  <dig> indicate that the improvement is statistically significant.

testing the robustness to misspecified technical variance
the probe-level variance in the simulated datasets generated above is sampled from multi-mgmos results from the real mouse dataset. when applying puma-clust it was assumed that the level of noise is known, but in practice it would be estimated using multi-mgmos. we would like to test robustness to errors in estimating the measurement error variance. we therefore add some noise to the sampled standard deviation, σ^

clustering on a real mouse time-course dataset
the improved performance of the new model, puma-clust, over the standard gaussian mixture model on simulated datasets was shown in the previous section. here, we evaluate the performance of puma-clust on a real mouse dataset showing periodic behavior  <cit>  by comparing with the results of the standard mixture model implemented in mclust.

this time-course dataset profiles the gene expression changes during the hair growth cycle, which is synchronised for the first two cycles following birth. after two cycles the hair growth cycle becomes progressively unsynchronised. lin et al. use affymetrix mg-u74av <dig> microarray chips to profile mrna expression in mouse back skin from eight representative time points in order to discover regulators in hair-follicle morphogenesis and cycling  <cit> . the microarray dataset utilised a total of  <dig> chips with each time point consisting of three or four replicates. the first five time points  cover the first synchronised cycle and the last three time points  belong to the asynchronous cycles. they identified  <dig>  potential hair cycle-associated genes using a f test comparing synchronous and asynchronous time points. this dataset is available at  <cit> .

we apply both puma-clust and mclust clustering over the first five time points which belong to the synchronised cycle and includes  <dig> chips. for mclust the raw mouse dataset is processed using the popular probe-level method gcrma  <cit> . for puma-clust the raw data is processed by multi-mgmos. we also applied mclust to mas <dig>  and multi-mgmos gene expression measurements and the performance was found to be similar to the results presented here using gcrma.

the clustering is performed on the  <dig>  potential hair cycle-associated genes. the obtained expression level for each probe-set from both probe-level methods are normalised to have zero mean and standard deviation one. the bayesian information criterion  is used to determine the number of clusters. the calculated bic for various numbers of clusters is shown in figure  <dig>  it can be seen that the optimal bic for puma-clust is obtained at k =  <dig> and the optimal bic for mclust is obtained at k =  <dig>  in both cases, mclust converges to the model having the same full rank covariance matrix for each component . in order to make the different clustering methods comparable, the number of clusters for each method should be the same. therefore, the 22-cluster and the 30-cluster cases are compared separately. the  <dig> clusters obtained from puma-clust and mclust are shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> respectively, and the  <dig> clusters obtained are shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  respectively. for visualisation, the average expression level at each time point over replicates is shown for both the gene profile and the cluster center.

to assess whether biologically relevant clusters are created using the two methods, we systematically performed go annotation enrichment analysis for the individual clusters using david  <dig> . the go enrichment analysis allows the direct assessment of the biological significance for gene clusters found based on the enrichment of genes belonging to a specific go functional category. the enrichment calculation performed in david is a modified fisher exact test. the resulting p-value shows the biological significance for gene clusters. based on our experience, go biological process term level  <dig> gives more precise category definitions which are useful in further biological interpretations. therefore, a meaningful go enrichment analysis is to examine enriched categories of go biological process at term level  <dig> and to select an enrichment cutoff at a conventional p-value of  <dig> .

we found that for the 22-cluster results from the two methods puma-clust produced more clusters  with at least one enriched go category in comparison to mclust , as shown in figure  <dig>  a visual inspection of these mclust clusters without an enriched go category indicates that four out of five of these clusters  contain heterogeneous temporal expression profiles . since the number of enriched go categories found varies greatly among clusters ), the average number  of enriched categories among the  <dig> puma-clust clusters is only slightly greater than the average among the mclust clusters . a more meaningful indicator of the distribution differences is the median number of enriched categories in puma-clust clusters  and mclust clusters . the same enrichment analysis method was repeated using the  <dig> clusters for both methods, and the results still clearly indicate that the puma-clust method results in more biologically meaningful clusters than the mclust method. using  <dig> clusters, all clusters generated by puma-clust have at least one enriched go category, in comparison to only  <dig> out of  <dig> clusters created by mclust as shown in figure  <dig>  the median number of enriched categories for puma-clust and mclust are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, as shown in figure  <dig>  based on these go enrichment analyses, it is evident that puma-clust generated more biologically relevant clusters than mclust.

for further validation of the performance of puma-clust, we also applied mclust on multi-mgmos measurements so that we can compare puma-clust with mclust using exactly the same probe-level summary method. mas  <dig>  is another popular probe-level method and therefore we also applied mclust to mas  <dig>  processed data for comparison. enrichment analyses on the 22-cluster results for all four approaches  show that mclust on multi-mgmos processed data performed similarly to mclust on gcrma processed data. both have five clusters without any enriched category, but mclust with gcrma had slightly higher median value for the number of enriched categories . although mclust with mas <dig>  only had two clusters without any enriched category, its median value for the number of enriched categories is notably less than that of puma-clust with multi-mgmos . thus, puma-clust with multi-mgmos still performs best in comparison to mclust using the three different expression summary methods. for 30-cluster results and for results with other numbers of clusters we found similar results. in particular, when the same probe-level method, multi-mgmos, is used, puma-clust always outperforms mclust. the improved performance is due to the inclusion of the probe-level measurement error which down-weights the effect of the noisy low expressed genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of the measurement error in model-based clustering of gene expression data. a standard gaussian mixture model with an unequal volume spherical covariance matrix is augmented to incorporate probe-level measurement error obtained from affymetrix microarrays. results from simulated datasets and a real mouse time-course dataset show that the inclusion of probe-level measurement error results in improved and more biologically meaningful clustering of gene expression data. the augmented clustering model has been implemented in an r package, pumaclust, for public use of the method.

the improved performance of the augmented model has been shown in this paper. it is possible that further improvement can also be made by considering the replicate information where repeated measurements are available for time points. clustering on repeated measurements has been considered by  <cit> , but all of these approaches do not include the probe-level measurement error. including both probe-level noise and replicate information in the clustering would be a useful extension of our work.
