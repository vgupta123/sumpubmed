BACKGROUND
a phenotype, characterized by juvenile hairlessness, thin skin and age dependent lung emphysema, has been encountered in a danish pig herd. all piglets showing the trait are descendants of a specific boar and the trait shows autosomal co-dominant inheritance. at the age of six months hair growth is increased but not fully restored. a similar phenotype has been described in knock-out mice deficient of the itgb <dig> gene  encoding the integrin β6-subunit. these mice display juvenile hairlessness mainly on their neck, head and inner thighs, macrophage infiltration of the dermis and lymphocyte infiltration of the conductive airways of the lung. at the age of puberty, hair growth is resumed  <cit>  and later, age dependent lung emphysema appears  <cit> .

integrins are a family of cell surface heterodimers, each consisting of an α- and a β-subunit. the integrin molecules are anchored in the cell membrane where they mediate a wide range of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions  <cit> . the β6-subunit pairs only with the αv-subunit constituting integrin αvβ <dig>  <cit> . the αv-subunit, however, pairs with five different β-subunits  <cit>  and plays a central role with respect to normal embryonic development and survival. ablation of itgav in mice causes malformations and embryonic or postnatal death  <cit> .

the expression of αvβ <dig> is restricted to epithelia and seems predominant in various developing organs of the embryo/fetus  <cit> . besides, various patho-biological events induce a neo-expression of this integrin, e.g. tumor genesis  <cit> , wound healing  <cit> , and general cases of clinical or subclinical inflammation  <cit> .

the resemblance between the phenotype detected in the pigs and the phenotype of the itgb6-/- mice suggests itgb <dig> as a candidate gene for the mutated pig phenotype. however, since the itgb <dig> polypeptide dimerizes with itgav the gene encoding itgav is also considered a possible candidate.

in this paper the mutated pig phenotype is characterized macroscopically and histologically. furthermore, taking the outset in linkage studies, sequencing and functional studies, itgav and itgb <dig> are evaluated as candidates for the phenotype.

RESULTS
phenotype 0– <dig> months
based on the founder boar and his offspring an experimental population  was established. a clear difference in amount of hair was observed in the pedigree, i.e. animals could be scored as normal , heterozygous  and homozygous  according to these observations. hh pigs displayed hairless areas primarily on the back and rear, whereas hh pigs were almost entirely hairless. the degree of hairlessness varied somewhat within each genotype group. the skin appeared thin and reddish, mainly in the hh pigs but also in the hh pigs .

shoulder and thigh skin samples from nine two months old pigs  were evaluated histologically. the thickness of the dermis was measured and the hair follicles were counted. no lesions were observed apart from a few small areas with erosions and mild hyperkeratosis, which are normally present in the skin of piglets. however, in skin sections from both shoulder and thigh the dermis was significantly thinner in the hh and hh groups compared to the hh group . there was no significant difference between the hh and hh groups. the hh group had significantly fewer hairs/hair follicles than the hh group , and the hh group had significantly fewer hairs/hair follicles than the hh group .

musculi arrectores pili were totally absent in skin from hh animals and only rarely detected in skin from hh animals. another morphologic difference was the tissue surrounding the sweat glands in the skin. in all skin sections these glands were found within the dermis close to the subcutis, but in hh skin they were embedded in connective tissue and in hh skin they were surrounded by fat tissue .

histological examination of lung tissue samples from the same nine pigs showed signs of interstitial pneumonia to a variable extend characterized by thickening of the alveolar walls due to septal infiltrates of mononuclear cells and hyperplasia of type ii pneumocytes. within some of the interstitial infiltrates syncytial cells were seen. also hyperplasia of the bronchial associated lymphoid tissue  was present to a variable extend in all animals.

phenotype of adults
around the age of six months, hair growth was resumed but even in adult hh pigs the hair coat was very thin and frizzy. hh animals grew slightly more hair; however they did not recover normal hair growth. the skin of both hh and hh adults became very scaly and histological examination of skin sections revealed noticeable hyperkeratotic epidermis. musculi arrectores pili were still absent and the sweat glands were also surrounded by connective tissue in the skin of adult hh animals.

lung tissue of the hh animals  and older hh animals  also showed interstitial pneumonia as well as areas with alveolar enlargement  .

lung tissues from one yonger adult hh animal  and the hh animals  showed normal, diffusely distended alveolar lumina. some septal enlargement was observed in the lung tissue from the hh and one hh.

candidate region
itgb <dig> and itgav have been shown to be mapped to mmu <dig> at positions  <dig> and  <dig> cm respectively and to the orthologous region on hsap <dig> at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb respectively  <cit> . based on a human-porcine comparative map the itgb <dig> and itgav candidate region was identified on ssc <dig>  <cit> .

radiation hybrid  mapping
the porcine itgb <dig> and itgav genes were mapped by rh mapping. itgb <dig> was mapped to the interval between the markers cl <dig> and cl <dig>  <cit>  on ssc <dig> corresponding to an approximate position of  <dig> cm  <cit> . itgav was mapped to the interval between the markers cl <dig> and cl <dig> corresponding to an approximate position of  <dig> cm on ssc <dig>  <cit> . these results are in agreement with the orthologous positions of the human itgb <dig> and itgav.

linkage study
a linkage study was performed with seven microsatellite markers selected from the candidate region on ssc <dig>  the locus underlying the mutated phenotype was linked to four of the seven microsatellites: s <dig>  sw <dig>  ks <dig> and sw <dig>  <cit>  with lod scores from  <dig>  to <dig> . the mutated locus could be genetically mapped between markers s <dig> and sw <dig>  with high confidence , however finer mapping with sw <dig> and ks <dig> could not be supported by a lod score higher than  <dig>  keeping the linear order of the markers from the published linkage map  <cit>  the result can be illustrated as shown in figure  <dig> 

itgb <dig> coding sequence
itgb <dig> specific pcr amplification from skin cdna samples gave either little or no pcr products, whereas the transcript was easily amplified in lung cdna. pcr products covering the whole itgb <dig> transcript were cloned and sequenced. the porcine itgb <dig> coding sequence  consists of  <dig> nucleotides covering  <dig> exons. a short 3'utr of only  <dig> nucleotides precedes the polya tail. the amino acid sequence  has a similarity of  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively to the human  and mouse  itgb <dig> amino acid sequences. it contains β <dig> specific features like the  <dig> arg-gly-asp  sequences in the extracellular part and the  <dig> amino acid extension of the carboxyl terminus  <cit> .

as observed for many other integrins  <cit>  sequence analysis revealed alternative splice forms of the pre-mrna. the following alternative splicing events were observed: skipping of exon  <dig> leading to frameshift and generation of a stop codon in exon 3; skipping of exon  <dig> ; skipping of exon  <dig> through  <dig> with the concomitant inclusion of an additional sequence  that does not show homology to any of the splice variants reported in other species. in addition, there was evidence of concomitant skipping of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  all splice forms of itgb <dig> were detected in both hh and hh pigs. alignment of the hh and hh itgb <dig> coding sequences revealed one synonymous snp but no allelic variants of this snp showed cosegregation with the phenotype.

itgav coding sequence
the porcine itgav coding sequence was generated by sequencing itgav specific pcr products amplified in lung cdna. the porcine itgav coding sequence  consists of  <dig> nucleotides and the 3' utr consists of  <dig> nucleotides. the amino acid sequence  has a similarity of  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively to the human  and mouse  itgav amino acid sequences. no snp's were detected in the alignment of the hh and hh itgav sequences.

quantitative pcr
real time quantitative pcr  was used to study expression of itgb <dig> and itgav in animals with the hh and hh genotype respectively. in itgb <dig>  two different target sequences were included: one within exon  <dig> and one spanning exon  <dig> to  <dig>  these exons seem to be present in all detected splice variants and the two target sequences provide an opportunity to compare the expression of two different parts of the transcript. in itgav the target sequence was spanning exon  <dig> to  <dig>  the expression of itgb <dig> and itgav was analyzed using rest  <cit>  and the pair wise fixed reallocation randomisation test included in the programme. all three target sequences showed a slight upregulation in the hh group but the differences did not reach the significance level  .

qpcr data for the two itgb <dig> target sequences ex9- <dig> and ex <dig> and the three reference genes rpl <dig>  ywhaz and hprt and the itgav target sequence ex1- <dig> and the three reference genes rpl <dig>  tbp and hprt. the hh group serves as control group for the hh group. all three p-values >  <dig>  indicating not significantly different expression levels in the hh and hh groups.

western blot
lung protein samples from one mouse  and three pigs representing the genotypes hh, hh and hh were included in the western blot analysis. the detection was performed using an anti-mouse integrin β <dig> antibody. we observed a band of approximately  <dig> kda in each of the pigs. these bands had an equal intensity and were comparable with the control mouse band of approximately  <dig> kda .

flow cytometry
the integrin αvβ <dig> expression on kidney cells was compared between the hh  and hh  genotypes by flow cytometry. this experiment was included to study the expression in a non-lung tissue. for the two hh pigs, approximately 85% of the kidney cells were integrin αvβ <dig> positive. for the hh pigs, the proportion of positive cells was lower, i.e. about 69%, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the mean fluorescence intensity of positive cell populations, however, was at the same level for individual pigs , showing a comparable integrin αvβ <dig> expression of the two genotypes.

immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemistry was performed with goat anti-mouse integrin β <dig> antibody on lung tissue from seven pigs representing young and adult animals of the three genotypes . lung tissues from all three genotypes stained with the antibody and the immunoreaction was localized to the alveolar, bronchiolar, bronchial and glandular epithelial cells .

discussion
the mutated pig phenotype was originally detected in a boar and among his offspring. it is most probably caused by a spontaneous mutation in the founder boar and the corresponding phenotype has resemblance to that of the itgb6-/- knockout mice. the only not coinciding features are the distribution of the hairlessness and the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltrations observed in the skin and lungs respectively of the knock-out mice. the interstitial pneumonia detected in the lungs of both young and adult pigs is most likely due to infection with porcine circovirus- <dig>  which is widespread within the danish population of pigs  <cit>  including our experimental population.

the fact that the hairlessness of the heterozygous pigs is intermediate indicates, that one functional copy of the gene in question is not enough to maintain a normal skin phenotype . the mutation seems to affect secondary structures of the skin in general. we have observed aplasia not only of hair follicles but also of musculi arrectores pili. furthermore, the sweat glands are embedded directly in the connective tissue without any surrounding fat tissue. also, the thickness of the dermis is affected.

both heterozygous and homozygous pigs develop age dependent lung emphysema. our animal material has not been sufficient to provide an "age of onset" of emphysema within the two genotype groups but our data suggest that emphysema appears around the age of puberty in homozygous animals and that the heterozygous pigs maintain a normal lung phenotype longer than the homozygous pigs.

although the candidate region on ssc <dig> was confirmed, our results so far have not supported itgb <dig> as a candidate gene. first, we did not detect any non-synonymous mutations in the coding region of the itgb <dig> gene in the hh animals. a difference in the expression level of itgb <dig> in the two genotype groups could have pointed towards a mutation in the regulatory region of this gene. even if the itgb <dig> expression was upregulated in the hh group, the difference was not significant. a reason for the upregulation could be the interstitial pneumonia observed in the hh group, as itgb <dig> is known to be upregulated in response to inflammation  <cit> . in the hh group we observed interstitial pneumonia in only one pig. the western blot showed an apparently equal expression of the itgb <dig> protein in the three groups.

the porcine gene encoding the integrin αv subunit  was mapped to a position on ssc <dig> within the candidate region. a mutation in itgav would be expected to have far more severe consequences, as the αv subunit pairs with five different β subunits  <cit> . in mice, for instance, the ablation of itgav causes embryonic or postnatal death  <cit> . still, a mutation in itgav could not be entirely excluded as such a mutation might reside in a region interacting specifically with the β <dig> subunit. sequencing of the itgav hh and hh coding sequences, however, did not reveal any potential causative mutation, and also, quantitative pcr results revealed an equal itgav expression in hh and hh pigs.

these observations were supported by the flow cytometric demonstration of high levels of the αvβ <dig> receptor on kidney cells from hh animals and immunohistochemical detection of the receptor in hh lung sections. the presence of the receptor in hh pigs was furthermore confirmed by immunocytochemical staining of monolayer hh pig kidney cells .

the pathogenesis underlying the hairlessness in the knockout mice is so far unknown. huang et al.  <cit>  observe fewer hair follicles and numerous degenerating hair follicles surrounded by mononuclear cells in the hairless dermis of the itgb6-/- mice, indicating an inflammatory response. it has been demonstrated that the expression of itgb <dig> is upregulated in response to injury and/or inflammation and that integrin αvβ <dig> exerts a modulating effect on the inflammatory response  <cit> . huang et al.  <cit>  argue that the lack of integrin αvβ <dig> in itgb6-/- mice allows for minor skin irritations to cause an escalated inflammatory response resulting in hairlessness, for instance in the neck skin where the mother lifts her pups. hair loss due to skin irritation can however, be excluded in the pig since the phenotype is inborn and without any sign of inflammatory response. interestingly, our more detailed histological characterization of the skin show that hair follicles are present at a low frequency, however, without presence of musculi arrectores pili. this indicates that the mechanism underlying the phenotype has a subtle influence on cell migration/cellular development during embryonal development.

in contrast to the hairlessness the pathogenesis regarding the lung emphysema is well described in the itgb6-/- mice. the condition is caused by an elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> , a macrophage expressed protease that degrades elastin causing a loss of lung elasticity and enlargement of alveolar airspaces. the elevated mmp <dig> level, again, is caused by a lack of active transforming growth factor beta- <dig> , which has a regulatory effect on the expression of mmp <dig>  <cit> . it has been shown that integrin αvβ <dig> is central in activating tgf-β <dig>  tgf-β <dig> is secreted in an inactive form bound to a latency associated peptide , but binding of αvβ <dig> to the lap part of the lap-tgf-β <dig> complex, allows tgf-β <dig> to interact with its receptor  <cit> . morris et al.  <cit>  report a 200-fold increase in the mmp <dig> expression in itgb <dig> knockout mice compared to wild-type mice.

our results have supported neither itgb <dig> nor itgav as candidate genes for juvenile hairlessness and age dependent emphysema in pigs. however, the resemblance with the itgb6-/- knockout phenotype in mice is striking and it is obvious to expect the causative mutation in the pig to affect a pathway analogous to the murine integrin αvβ <dig> – tgf-β <dig> – mmp <dig> – pathway. this pathway is, however, complex and elaborately regulated  <cit>  and involves several indispensable key elements in terms of maintaining full functionality. according to the database pigqtldb  <cit>  the region between s <dig> and ks <dig> on pig chromosome  <dig> is syntenic to human chromosome  <dig> in the region from approximately  <dig> mb to  <dig> mb. according to ensembl release  <dig>  march  <dig>  this region comprises  <dig> protein coding genes many of which are poorly annotated. thus, it will be necessary to narrow down the candidate region further, before good predictions of candidate genes possibly involved in the biochemical pathway leading to the phenotype in question can be made. it is, however, also important to keep in mind that we can not yet completely rule out that the integrin αvβ <dig> is implicated in the phenotype since for instance a mutation in the promoter region or in a transcription factor/transcription factor target site could influence expression of either of the genes temporally or spatially.

CONCLUSIONS
a mutated phenotype has been detected in the pig. the phenotype is characterized by hairlessness until puberty, thin skin with few hair follicles and absence of musculi arrectores pili and development of localized areas of emphysema in the lungs from the age of puberty. linkage studies have unequivocally pointed out the region harbouring the mutation responsible for the phenotype. however, sequencing and functional studies of the most obvious candidate genes, itgb <dig> and itgav have so far not supported either of them as the causative gene behind juvenile hairlessness and age dependent lung emphysema in pigs. future work will therefore be directed at narrowing down the candidate region through linkage analysis in an extended experimental family. we are in the process of breeding additional animals for this purpose. once the candidate region spans only a few megabases, re-sequencing will be performed in hh and hh animals with the purpose of identifying the mutation explaining the phenotype in question. further characterization of the mutated gene or locus and the effect of the mutation will provide novel information about the biochemical pathway involved in the development of lung emphysema.
