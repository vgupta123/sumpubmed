BACKGROUND
pigeonpea , also known as tuar or arhar, is an economically important legume crop with an annual production of  <dig>  mt. cultivation of pigeonpea occurs on ~ <dig> million hectares, primarily in asia and countries of eastern and southern africa, and to a lesser extent in countries of latin america and the caribbean. as a member of the sub tribe cajaninae, pigeonpea is contained in an early diverging lineage of tribe phaseoleae, a monophyletic group of legumes that contains several of the world's most important food legumes including soybean, common bean, cowpea and mung bean. similar to most other phaseoleae species, pigeonpea contains  <dig> pairs of chromosomes  and has a moderately sized genome in the range of  <dig>  pg or  <dig> mbp  <cit> .

india is the world's largest producer of pigeonpea and the presumed center of origin  <cit> . relative to most other crop legumes pigeonpea is highly drought tolerant, being able to retain productivity with less than  <dig> mm annual rainfall. owing to its capacity for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, pigeonpea seeds have high levels of protein and they specifically enriched for amino acids that are often limiting in the human diet, including methionine, lysine, and tryptophan. in resource poor areas of the world, pigeonpea serves as an important forage and cover crop, while the stems provide wood for tool making and fuel, and thatch for roofing. these factors, especially the ability to withstand elevated temperatures and limited water availability, add to pigeonpea's importance as a crop in semi-arid tropical  regions of the world, especially in the sat of india where approximately 77% of global production occurs. despite its importance in the sat regions, little concerted research effort has been directed at either improvement or technology transfer in this crop. thus, the pigeonpea production has remained static  <cit>  and a range of biotic and abiotic stresses continue reduce yields by 50% or greater  <cit> . among the most important limiting factors are fusarium wilt, sterility mosaic disease, pod borer, soil salinity and water logging. very recently, hybrid breeding technology based on the cytoplasmic-nuclear male-sterility  system has been implemented in the pigeonpea breeding programme at icrisat  <cit> , and this technology holds great potential to increase pigeonpea productivity.

various advances in plant biotechnology and especially genomics together with traditional plant breeding technologies have led to the development of new improved varieties in a number of crop species with greater tolerance/resistance and higher yield  <cit> . in this context, molecular markers play a very important role as these are used for estimating diversity in germplasm, trait mapping, molecular breeding, genetic purity assessment of hybrid seeds, etc. among a range of molecular markers starting with isozymes, rflp , rapd , aflp , ssr , dart , and most recently snp , that have become available during last two decades  <cit> , ssr markers have emerged as the current markers of choice for plant genetics and breeding applications  <cit> . while snp markers have a promising future in plant breeding applications, and may augment or displace ssr based marker systems, snp based markers and associated technologies are in their infancy in most crops, including pigeonpea, while ssr marker technologies are better established for wide spread use in molecular breeding.

in case of pigeonpea, at present, only a few hundred ssr markers are available  <cit> , a situation that is further hampered by low levels of genetic diversity within cultivated germplasm demands development of ssr markers at large scale.

traditionally, three approaches are used for identification and development of ssr markers:  construction of ssr-enriched library followed by sequencing of ssr positive clones  <cit> ,  mining of est  transcript sequence generated by sanger sequencing  <cit>  or short transcript sequences generated by next generation sequencing technologies  <cit> ,  mining the bac - end sequences   <cit> . so far, the first two approaches have been used for developing ssr markers in pigeonpea with some success despite the labour-intensive and time consuming nature of the ssr enrichment and very low polymorphism levels of ssrs identified from the mining of transcript sequences. the development of ssr markers from bess circumvents the limitations of the first two approaches, as a large number of ssrs can be rapidly identified and such genomic ssrs tend to display higher level of polymorphism relative to transcript associated ssrs. in addition, bes-ssr markers serve a useful resource for integrating genetic and physical maps  <cit> .

the present study was undertaken with following objectives:  construction of two bac libraries and sequencing of bac-ends,  comprehensive analysis of bac-end sequences  for gaining insights in pigeonpea genome,  mining the bess for development of large scale ssr markers,  characterization of newly developed bes-ssr markers on a panel of parental genotypes,  development of the first ssr-based genetic map for pigeonpea, and  identification of an informative set of ssr markers suitable for purity assessment of two leading hybrids, icph  <dig> and icph  <dig> to facilitate efficient hybrid seed production.

RESULTS
bac-end sequence analysis
two bac libraries were developed from pigeonpea cultivar "asha", based on partial digestion with hindiii and bamhi restriction enzymes. bac clones were sequenced from both insert ends to yield  <dig>  dna sequences with an average read length of  <dig> bp.

as a prelude to the comprehensive analysis of bac-end sequences, we analyzed bess for redundancy between clones and for sequence content as well as for removal of cytoplasmic organellar sequences using the annotation pipeline shown in figure  <dig>  sequences were clustered using criteria of ≥95% identity and ≥ <dig> bp overlap, producing a set of  <dig>  singleton sequences and  <dig>  sequence clusters. this non-redundant sequence set was filtered for rrna, chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences using blast'n' against datasets of the corresponding sequence types, yielding a set of  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  non-redundant bess that were presumed to derive from the nuclear genome. in total this non-redundant nuclear genome dataset surveys  <dig> mb or ~ <dig> % of the pigeonpea genome.

a series of parallel analyses were performed to annotate the features of singletons and clustered bess. similarity to transcribed sequences or known proteins was assessed by blast'n' and blast'x' of sequences against the tigr plant transcript assemblies http://plantta.jcvi.org/ and the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant protein database, respectively, using an e-value cut-off of < <dig> e- <dig>  further evidence of protein coding regions, as well as standardized nomenclature, was obtained by queries against the interpro and geneontology molecular function databases. similarity to known plant repeat sequences was assessed by blast'n' and tblast'x' against a database of plant repeat sequences .

based on the compiled information, bess were subdivided into five primary categories:  non-annotated,  gene-containing,  retroelement-containing,  transposable element-containing, and  organelle- or ribosomal rrna-containing, as shown in table  <dig>  most sequence annotations were supported by multiple lines of evidence and a fraction of sequences were predicted to include both genes and either retroelements or transposable elements. non-annotated sequences accounted for the majority of bac ends, representing 53% of all non-redundant singletons and clusters, while nearly equal proportions of bess were annotated as genes  or retroelements . it is likely that the retroelement category is an underestimate, because many of the most abundant interpro descriptors within the "gene" category, such as "dna/rna polymerase", are equally consistent with either "gene" or "retroelement". in the absence of additional annotation supporting classification as a retroelement, such sequences were classified as "gene".


atotal unique clusters represent the total number of sequence clusters plus the number of singleton  sequences.

btotal unique sequence represents the sum of the nucleotide length of all unique sequence clusters.

cthree polymorphic markers are from bac ends annotated as "chloroplast" and are not listed in this table.

d <dig>  ssr markers were derived from  <dig>  bess, with some bess containing multiple ssrs

clustering of sequences as singletons or contigs provides a relative measure of sequence copy number . as shown in figure 2a and 2b, greater than 80% of sequences annotated as either gene or non-annotated were associated with clusters of depth < <dig>  and their relative prevalence declined rapidly with cluster depth > <dig> . by contrast, nearly 50% of all retroelement-containing sequences and 33% of all transponson-containing sequences were associated with clusters of depth > <dig>  and they accounted for the vast majority of clusters with depth > <dig> sequences. thus, sequence cluster depth supports the truism that mobile elements  are often members of repetitive sequence families, while genes and intergenic regions  typically reside in less repetitive regions of the genome.

identification of bes-ssrs
with the goal of increasing genetic marker repertoire in pigeonpea, bess  were surveyed for the presence of ssrs by means of the microsatellite  search module  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  ssrs were identified, with mononucleotide  and di-nucleotide  repeats predominating. excluding mono-nucleotide repeats, which were almost exclusively poly-a motifs, a/t-rich repeats accounted for 63% of all ssrs. the frequency of at-rich repeats increased in rank order as motif length increased, from a low of 57% in di-nucleotide repeats to a high of 95% in penta-nucleotide repeats; this situation was absent only in the case of hexa-nucleotide repeats, where motifs with ≥50% gc content accounted for 53% of all repeats.

ssrs were either perfect ssrs  or compound ssrs . perfect ssrs were further subdivided according to the length of ssr tracts  <cit> : class i ssrs  and class ii ssrs . class i ssrs were enriched for di-nucleotide  and tri-nucleotide repeats , while class ii repeats were enriched in mono-nucleotide repeats , with a less frequent occurrence of di-  and tri-nucleotide  repeats.

correlation between bac end annotation and ssr occurrence
after excluding all mono-nucleotide repeat ssrs and ssrs with length < <dig> bp, the remaining  <dig>  ssrs were selected for further analysis. these  <dig>  ssrs were derived from  <dig>  non-redundant bac ends ,  <dig> of which were annotated as organelle .

the remaining  <dig>  non-redundant bess were divided among the four annotation categories, as shown in table  <dig>  eighty-nine percent of these ssr-containing bess  were either non-annotated or gene-containing, while  <dig> % were retroelement-containing . the rate of ssr occurrence per  <dig> kb also differs considerably between annotation categories, consistent with the uneven discovery of ssrs between annotation categories. thus, ssrs are twice as frequent per  <dig> kb in gene-containing  and non-annotated  sequences compared to retroelement-containing  sequences . consistent with the likely pressure of purifying selection, bac ends containing tri-nucleotide repeats were more likely to be annotated as genes , compared to the remaining ssr-containing bac sequences .

for purposes of developing a uniform analysis of known pigeonpea ssrs, we obtained  <dig> ssrs submitted to ncbi genbank by researchers at the university of bonn  and previously developed by our group . both of these publicly available ssr sets were generated using pcr-based microsatellite enrichment strategies. as shown in the table  <dig>  the relative distribution of ssrs between genome fractions differs substantially for ssrs obtained by means of genome enrichment compared to random bac end sequencing. in particular, genome-enrichment methodologies produced approximately three times the rate of retroelement-associated ssrs and an ~100-fold increase in the rate of ssrs derived from organelle or rrna sequences, most of which were chloropast derived .

development of novel ssr genetic markers
primer pairs were designed and synthesized for a total of  <dig>  non-redundant bac-end sequence ssrs . we refer to these ssr markers as ccm  .

all  <dig>  primer pairs were screened for amplification of dna from two pigeonpea genotypes, i.e., icp  <dig> and the popular variety "asha", icpl  <dig>  this analysis identified a set of  <dig>  markers  with scorable amplicons . these  <dig>  ssrs correspond to  <dig>  bess , because some bess contain multiple ssrs. screening of these  <dig>  markers on  <dig> pigeonpea genotypes, including  <dig> cultivated and one wild type , further defined a subset of  <dig> polymorphic markers . among these polymorphic ssrs, allele count ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the germplasm surveyed.  <dig> of the  <dig> polymorphic ssrs were polymorphic exclusively in wild species. allelic data obtained from  <dig> genotypes were used to calculate the polymorphism information content  value of each ccm marker, and thus infer the discriminatory power of these ccm markers. pic values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  .

amd: medium duration, bsd: short duration, cdm: days to maturation, ddf: days to flowering, b: brown, p: purple, c: cream

as shown in table  <dig>  class i ssrs were on average more polymorphic  than class ii ssrs , with mean pic values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  , respectively. within this set of perfect ssrs, di-nucleotide repeats accounted for the largest number of polymorphic loci i.e.  <dig> % for class i and  <dig> % for class ii). ssrs derived from compound repeats had an average polymorphism rate of  <dig> %, similar to class i ssrs. the average genotype pair was distinguished by  <dig> polymorphic ssrs . as expected, however, polymorphism rates varied considerably depending on the genotype pair under comparison, from a low of  <dig> polymorphic ssrs  to a high of  <dig> polymorphic ssrs .

construction of an ssr-based genetic map
an inter-specific f <dig> population derived from icp  <dig>  × icpw  <dig>  was selected for the construction of a reference genetic map. consistent with a wide genetic cross, this pairwise comparison had the highest number of polymorphic ssrs . the mapping population was genotyped with all polymorphic markers and marker segregation data were analyzed by the goodness of fit test for a 1:2: <dig> segregation ratio. only  <dig>  markers showed good agreement with the expected segregation ratio 1:2: <dig> . among the  <dig> markers with deviation from mendelian ratios we observed instances of complete absence or very low occurence of one parental allele, and instances of excess heterozygosity.

the genetic linkage map was constructed in a stepwise manner, beginning with the  <dig> normally segregating markers at lod  <dig> and a minimum recombination fraction of  <dig> . subsequently, the  <dig> distorted markers were tested for integration with the help of joinmap  <dig>  software. the combined  <dig> markers yielded a genetic map of  <dig>  cm  , with an average of  <dig> markers per linkage groups and an average between marker distance of  <dig>  cm. a total of  <dig> linkage group could be assigned, and these are presumed to correspond to the haploid chromosome set of c. cajan .

identification of informative ssr markers for hybrid purity assessment
in pigeonpea, there is a need for genetic markers to assess hybrid seed purity. among the genotypes surveyed for ssr polymorphism , four genotypes  have been used for the development of two hybrids: icph  <dig>  and icph  <dig>   <cit> . for each hybrid,  <dig> polymorphic markers were selected that distinguished the parental lines and which gave high quality amplification in prior analyses. to assess the reliability of these ssr markers,  <dig> seeds of icph  <dig> and  <dig> seeds of icph  <dig> were obtained from the icrisat germplasm and analyzed together with seeds of parental lines. based on this analysis, both icph  <dig> and icph  <dig> seed stocks had high rates of purity . however, the frequency with which tested hybrids showed banding patterns typical of both parental alleles was dependent upon the markers under analysis. accordingly the marker wise hybrid purity index varied between markers, ranging from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  for icph  <dig> and from  <dig> %  to 100%  for icph  <dig>  a total of  <dig> markers for icph  <dig> and  <dig> markers for icph  <dig> could detect purity between  <dig> - 100% . the frequency of heterozygosity for the hybrid in icph  <dig> ranged from a minimum of  <dig> %  to a maximum of 100% . in case of icph  <dig> heterozygosity for a hybrid ranged from minimum  <dig> %  to a maximum of  <dig> % .

with the objective of reducing the cost and time of pcr assays for purity assessment, we identified sets of ssrs with allele sizes that were sufficiently different to permit multiplex analysis of hybrid seeds. in the case of icph  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> multiplex groups . figure  <dig> shows the example of multiplexing the  <dig> icph  <dig> mg  <dig> markers. similarly for icph  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> marker groups. a single multiplex of four markers  produced well resolved polymorphisms on both icph  <dig> and icph  <dig> 

hybrid/marker 


aout of  <dig> informative markers identified for icph  <dig>  only  <dig> primers could be grouped in different multiplexes and the marker ccm <dig> could not be multiplexed in any marker group.

discussion
the narrow genetic base of pigeonpea has hindered the wide use of molecular marker technology for crop improvement  <cit> . in the present study, two bac libraries were developed with an estimated ~11× genome coverage of pigeonpea. sequencing of  <dig>  bac clones from both insert ends provided  <dig>  bess. removal of cytoplasmic orgeneller bess and cluster analysis facilitated the maximum possible recovery of nuclear genomic sequences comprising  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  non-redundant contigs. with an objective to understand the constitution of ssr containing bac clones, bess were run through an annotation pipeline. major proportion of the sequences remained non-annotated which may be considered as 'novel' c. cajan sequences. the overall repetitive fraction, resulting from bes analysis was found to be intermediate  when compared with the percentage of repetitive elements in bess of other legumes such as trifolium , soybean , and common bean   <cit> . bes annotation analysis has shown a considerable variability in the amount of repetitive fraction in different crop species such as tomato   <cit> , papaya   <cit> , banana   <cit>  and citrus   <cit> . this variation in the amount of repetitive elements in bess is an indicative feature of presence of repetitive elements in the genome of a species. a varying level of annotations in different species may also be responsible for difference in repetitive elements. proportion of annotated genic fraction was found more or less similar as observed in the bess analysis of other crop species such as phaseolus   <cit> , apple   <cit> , banana   <cit> , brassica   <cit>  and papaya   <cit> .

bess have been very useful to develop ssr markers in several plant species including legumes like soybean  <cit> , common bean  <cit>  and medicago  <cit> . in terms of ssrs abundance, overall density of  <dig> ssr per  <dig>  kb seems to be in good congruency with the earlier reports in plant genomes  <cit> . similar results showing ssr frequencies of  <dig> ssr per  <dig> to  <dig> kb were achieved in different plant species like medicago, soybean, lotus, arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . this discrepancy observed in different studies may be accounted to  amount of sequence data analyzed,  criteria for ssr identification, and  different sources of derived sequences. it is also important to note that after excluding non-annotated bess, majority  of ssrs belong to be associated with genes. these observations are in agreement of the comprehensive study in plant genomes where ssrs were found associated mainly with genes  <cit> .

in terms of distribution of ssrs, unlike the common occurrence of 'cg' motif in monocot species, 'cg' motifs were the least abundant in pigeonpea genome, as previously observed in other legume species . such low abundance of "cg" di-nucleotide repeats may be attributed to their tendency of forming secondary structures , leading to a selective pressure against 'cg' accumulation in genomes  <cit> .

while converting identified ssrs into genetic markers, though  <dig>  ssr primer pairs were synthesized; of these  <dig>   primers yielded scorable amplicons. this rate of successful amplification is quite higher than earlier reported in pigeonpea  <cit> . all the repeat classes showed more than 98% amplification except di-nucleotide repeats which had comparatively lower rate of amplification .

all the successfully amplified primer pairs were screened for polymorphism on a set of  <dig> diverse pigeonpea genotypes representing parents of  <dig> mapping populations segregating for various traits. these mapping populations represented the best cross combinations based on diversity revealed through morphological attributes and available marker data  <cit> . the overall frequency of length polymorphism was found to be  <dig> % which is lower than reported in earlier studies i.e. 50%  <cit> ,  <dig> %  <cit>  and 95%  <cit> . this can be attributed to use of only one wild species genotype in this study unlike earlier studies. occurrence of a very low level of dna polymorphism among pigeonpea cultivars is not unexpected as several studies have documented such results  <cit> .

as expected degree of marker polymorphism was lower in intra-specific populations than in inter-specific mapping population . the frequency of marker polymorphism increased dramatically with ssr locus longer than  <dig> bp. pic values for ssr markers were also analyzed in relation to repeat length and unit type. in terms of repeat length, class i ssrs were more polymorphic as compared to the class ii ssrs which may be accounted to the hyper-variable nature of class i ssrs  <cit>  among different type of repeat unit classes, tetra-nucleotide repeats, in general, showed the higher average pic value  followed by di-nucleotide repeats . it was also observed that among tri-nucleotide repeat class, the 'taa' repeat motifs, displayed higher polymorphism . similarly, 'ta' repeat motifs in di-nucleotide repeat class had a higher average pic value  compared to the others. similar trends were also observed in other legumes such as chickpea  <cit> ,  <cit>  and  <cit>  where the ssr markers with repeat motifs 'taa' or 'ta' exhibited extensive abundance and polymorphism as well. higher average pic value of compound ssrs  can be attributed to the fact that the markers with compound ssrs have more than one ssr motif, which increases their chance to be polymorphic  <cit> .

this study provides a list of polymorphic markers for different mapping populations that segregate for a number of important traits like fusarium wilt , sterlity mosaic disease , fertility restorer  etc. that are important for pigeonpea improvement  <cit> . genotyping of these mapping populations with identified polymorphic markers together with phenotyping data should provide the markers associated with qtls /gene for trait of interest that can be used for enhancing the breeding efficiency through marker-assisted selection.

to develop a reference genetic map, an inter-specific cross was used so that a larger number of segregating loci can be integrated into the genetic map. usually ssr markers are co-dominant and follow mendelian inheritance  <cit> . however deviation from the expected segregation ratio for ssr markers is not an uncommon feature in inter-specific crosses and especially f <dig> population. significant distortion observed in the marker data may be attributed to several possible reasons such as the abortion of male or female gametes or the selective exclusion of a particular gametic genotype from fertilization, owing to incompatibility, incongruity, certation, or zygote selection  <cit> . percentage distortion observed in the present study is comparable with previously reported studies performed on inter-specific crosses  <cit> .

in the present study, the genetic map derived from an inter-specific cross icp  <dig> × icpw  <dig> included eleven discrete linkage groups corresponding to the basic chromosome number of the genus . initial construction of a skeletal map with un-skewed markers and followed by integration of distorted markers helped in minimizing the possibility for spurious assignments of markers  <cit> . the final map comprised of  <dig> marker loci with a total map length of  <dig>  cm having average spacing of  <dig>  cm between two marker loci. this is the first report on the construction of ssr-based genetic map in pigeonpea. therefore this map should serve as a 'reference map' for other future genetic maps of pigeonpea. moreover as the ssr markers are derived from the bac-end sequences, these markers and the map should be very useful resource for linking the genetic map with a 'future' physical map of pigeonpea  <cit> .

developed set of large number of ssr markers should be very useful for applied aspects of genetics and breeding in pigeonpea, especially when the cultivated gene pool has a narrow genetic diversity. in case of pigeonpea, cms- hybrid technology is becoming popular to tackle the low crop productivity  <cit> . for assessing the genetic purity of hybrids, in general, grow out test  based on morphological criteria is used. however, got is limited by the accuracy, time and labour cost  <cit> . in this context, for each of two hybrids , a set of  <dig> markers has been identified that can be used for purity assessment of hybrid seeds. ssr markers have been found very effective for determining hybrid purity in many species like rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> . in fact in case of icph  <dig> hybrid, two diagnostic ssr markers were identified for purity assessment in an earlier study also  <cit> . although some studies report suitability of even one marker for hybrid purity assessment test  <cit> . this study increases the diagnostic markers in large number for icph  <dig> and also identifies a set of diagnostic markers for another pigeonpea hybrid icph  <dig>  moreover identification of different marker groups, especially the group of common markers  for both hybrids, for undertaking multiplex assays provides an added value to enhance their utility for hybrid purity assessment.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary this study reports a large-scale development of ssr markers and construction of ssr based genetic map in pigeonpea for the first time. in addition, a large number of informative ssr markers that can be used in multiplexes for assessing the seed purity of two hybrids. it is anticipated that ssr markers and the genetic map reported in this study should provide a reference resource for construction and comparison of genetic maps for new mapping populations, finger printing and cultivar identification, assessment of genetic diversity and gene flow among cajanus species. new genetic maps, to be devloped based on polymorphic markers identified in this study, will facilitate trait mapping and marker assisted selection. furthermore, genomic ssr markers identified from bess and integrated into genetic maps provide a valuable resource for anchoring future physical map or whole genome sequence to the genetic map.
