BACKGROUND
pichia pastoris  is a methylotrophic yeast that is widely used for the production of heterologous proteins and metabolites; it is also used as a model organism for the study of peroxisome biosynthesis and degradation, as well as for the analysis of protein secretion . its ability to use methanol as a carbon and energy source, its non-fermentative utilization of glucose and its efficient growth on glycerol are key metabolic features that make it attractive for bioprocess development.

recently, liang et al.  <cit>  comprehensively annotated the p. pastoris transcriptome and identified novel untranslated regions , alternative splicing sites , internal ribosome entry sites , upstream atgs  and upstream orfs . transcriptional profiling of a recombinant strain harboring rhizomucor miehei lipase  under the control of the methanol-driven paox <dig> promoter revealed that cells grown on methanol induce genes involved in protein production and energy metabolism more than cells grown on glycerol. methanol utilization takes place in peroxisomes; genes such as the alcohol oxidases , formaldehyde dehydrogenase , dihydroxyacetone synthase  and peroxisomal genes  were all found to be induced on methanol.

the specific growth rate of a culture, which was kept constant in the study by liang et al.  <cit> , is also known to play a fundamental role in gene regulation and consequently in protein production. high growth rates were previously suggested to be beneficial for protein production in p. pastoris due to the up-regulation of genes related to gene expression and translation, while catabolic processes , were shown to correlate negatively with increasing growth rate  <cit> .

less is known about the specific regulation of carbon substrate utilization, with the notable exception of saccharomyces cerevisiae. most studies in s. cerevisiae have been performed on glucose-grown cells under respiro-fermentative or fermentative growth conditions  <cit>  or on non-fermentable carbon-sources such as glycerol or galactose. the shift from glucose to glycerol leads to extensive transcriptomic remodelling  <cit> , a global translational down-regulation  <cit>  and reduced growth rates. in contrast, the crabtree-negative yeast, p. pastoris, maintains its respiratory metabolism even under conditions of excess glucose  and exhibits similar growth rates and substrate uptake kinetics when grown on either glucose or glycerol  <cit> . shifts from glycerol to methanol, which is metabolized even more slowly with lower maximal specific growth rates, are often used in bioprocesses that employ p. pastoris.

transcriptional regulators involved in glucose repression have been identified and studied in the methylotrophic yeasts p. pastoris and hansenula polymorpha, and in the lactose-utilizing yeast kluyveromyces lactis  <cit> . glucose repression of methanol utilization genes is established as a feature of methylotrophic yeasts such as candida boidinii, h. polymorpha, pichia methanolica, and p. pastoris  <cit> , but the degree of repression/de-repression by different carbon sources is species-dependent. for example, different modes of regulation have been described for key enzymes of methanol metabolism pathways such as alcohol oxidase, dihydroxyacetone synthase and formaldehyde dehydrogenase . understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning the unique carbon substrate utilization properties of p. pastoris is now required in order to more fully understand this valuable host organism.

the regulation of gene expression is often analyzed at the level of transcription, although it is well established that altered transcript levels are not necessarily reflected by the corresponding protein levels  <cit> . for example, the protein level of more than 70% of s. cerevisiae protein-coding genes is transcriptionally regulated, but this drops to only about 50% in e. coli  <cit>  and is even lower in humans  <cit> . in order to obtain a more complete view of the regulation of gene expression in p. pastoris, we analyzed both transcriptional and translational responses of cells grown in glucose-, glycerol- or methanol-containing media. microarray analysis was done on the total mrna pool as well as on mrnas that had been fractionated based upon ribosome occupancy. we adapted published methods for polysome profiling  <cit> : translationally quiescent mrnas were defined as being associated with single ribosomes ; actively-translated mrnas with multiple ribosomes   <cit> . the hybridization of a microarray with these mrna fractions as well as the total mrna population provided insight into how efficiently individual mrna translation and global transcriptional responses are affected by carbon source utilization.

RESULTS
p. pastoris strain x- <dig> was cultivated in shake flasks under four different bioprocess conditions : excess glycerol or glucose ; limiting glucose ; and periodic methanol addition . cells grown in excess glucose or glycerol or those grown in methanol had growth rates close to μmax:  <dig>  h− <dig> for the former and  <dig>  h− <dig> for the latter conditions. cells in limiting glucose conditions grew at μ =  <dig>  h− <dig> table  <dig>

cultures with different biomass densities were fed with appropriate amounts of carbon substrate in order that the cells could be harvested at a similar od <dig> . growth rates   were recorded; the values were highly reproducible and reflect growth of typical bioprocess phases, as shown.



for polysome fractionation, cells were treated with cycloheximide, harvested and quickly chilled for sample preparation. isolates were used for polysome profiling to obtain the profile data and to collect mono- and polysome fraction samples for mrna extraction. mrna was isolated from the fractionated and unfractionated isolates for microarray analysis; for each condition three biological replicates were analyzed.

the excess glucose condition, which is often used as a control for studies in s. cerevisae, was used as a control in our experiments.

global transcript profiles are very similar for excess glucose or glycerol grown p. pastoris cells, while extensive transcriptional regulation is observed for cells grown on methanol or limiting glucose concentrations
differentially expressed genes were identified from fold changes between total rna samples . samples from the excess glucose condition were the control for all these experiments . transcriptional fold changes for all genes are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the data in figure  <dig> show that cells cultured in excess glycerol  or glucose  have a very similar transcriptome with just  <dig> genes differentially regulated; in contrast  <dig> genes are differentially regulated in methanol-grown cells  and  <dig>  are differentially regulated in glucose-limited cells  . the corresponding gene ontology  terms are listed in additional file  <dig>  a high correlation between the two excess carbon source condition transcriptomes  was also observed by principal component analysis , which showed a good correlation of the biological replicates of each condition . the methanol-grown and glucose-limited cells were also found to share many differentially-regulated genes and hence seem to be more similar to each other than to the two excess conditions .figure  <dig>

further analysis  revealed that only a small sub-set of genes are differently expressed in response to glycerol as carbon source , while most of the regulated genes are shared either with both  or at least one  of the two other conditions . we defined genes that are differentially regulated in excess glycerol conditions plus at least one other condition  to be subject to “glucose repression”. genes that are differentially regulated in response to methanol induction or limiting glucose conditions, but are not differentially regulated between the two excess conditions were defined as being subject to “carbon substrate repression”.

polysome-mrna association is lowest in glucose-limited cells and highest in methanol-grown cells
isolates of cells subject to the different growth conditions in table  <dig> were analyzed by polysome profiling, which characterizes the translational status of a cell according to the distribution of ribosomes across the mrna pool. profile curves showing the proportion of ribosomes that appear as individual sub-units , monosomes or polysomes  are shown in figure  <dig>  the ratios of the polysome to monosome peak areas  in the profiles  are presented in figure 3b: mrnas that are associated with polysomes are more highly-translated than mrnas associated with monosomes  <cit> . the p:m ratio is therefore established as a relative measure of translational activity at a cellular level  <cit> . in our experiments, triplicate cultures gave reproducible values for each of the different growth conditions.figure  <dig>

grown in different conditions.  representative polysome profiles and  a bar chart presenting p:m ratios  of the four different cultivation conditions . corresponding peaks  are indicated in the first  polysome profile. p:m ratios were calculated from areas beneath the profile curve using imagej.



due to their similar transcript profiles, the two fastest growing conditions  were anticipated to have similar p:m ratios. however, the excess glycerol condition had a higher p:m ratio  suggesting higher translational activity compared to cells grown under conditions of excess glucose. the p:m ratio was highest in cells grown on methanol, although the specific growth rate was significantly lower  compared to the excess glycerol and excess glucose conditions. the condition with the lowest specific growth rate  had the lowest p:m ratio.

the transcription of translation-related genes in p. pastoris was previously shown to be tightly connected to growth rate in glucose-limited chemostat cultivations  <cit> . we found that this was also true when we analyzed the total rna of unfractionated, slow-growing cells cultivated under limiting glucose conditions . under these conditions, most ribosomal and translation-related genes were found to be expressed at a lower level . strikingly, we found that those genes were equally expressed in slow-growing methanol fed cells  compared to excess glucose and glycerol , suggesting that the whole translation machinery is up-regulated despite the slow growth rate on methanol. the methanol induction-, excess glucose- and excess glycerol- conditions operated near μmax for their respective condition, which means that they possess a similar μ/μmax ratio. hence, the expression of growth-associated genes might respond to the ratio of μ/μmax, rather than an absolute value of the specific growth rate .

despite the general transcriptional down-regulation of translation-related genes in p. pastoris cells grown in limiting glucose, the transcription of certain genes is induced
certain genes required for ribosome biogenesis and its regulation, rna processing and translationally silent messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes  were highly expressed in p. pastoris cells grown in limiting glucose, as determined by the analysis of total mrna : rps22a  ribosomal subunit, homologous to mammalian ribosomal protein s15a and bacterial s <dig>  also up-regulated in methanol-fed cells); genes linked to ribosome association, interaction or biogenesis ; negative regulation of rna polymerase iii transcription and tor signaling ; rrpe -binding and glucose-induced transition from quiescence to growth ; rrna biogenesis  and mitochondrial ribosome recycling . poly-binding protein is also translation-associated, and the two genes are differently expressed  in p. pastoris cells grown in limiting glucose. the gene encoding the translational activator gis <dig> that was also up-regulated in limiting glucose, plays an important role as activator of mrnas with internal ribosome entry sites  <cit> . it binds to a specific subset of mrnas, associates with polysomes and localizes to rna processing bodies  and to stress granules. the role of cap-independent translation in physiological adaptation to stress in s. cerevisiae has been reported previously  <cit> . p bodies are used to store translationally silent mrnps  <cit> , and glucose-limited p. pastoris cells were found to differentially express related genes. dhh <dig>  was up-regulated, but pat <dig> and edc <dig>  with a similar function, were down-regulated in glucose-limited cells. hence, although limiting glucose decreases global translation, certain transcripts may be translated as a part of specific stress responses.

growth conditions have a minimal influence on transcript-specific translational regulation
we next examined the fractionated mrnas by microarray analysis. we normalized the abundance of each transcript in the polysome fraction to that of the total rna, which we termed the “translational state”. in order to confirm the integrity of the rna fractions, microarray signal intensities of the monosome, polysome and total rna samples from the limiting glucose condition were compared as previously described  <cit> . the log <dig> intensity values of total rna correlated with log <dig> of the sums of intensities in the monosome- and polysome-bound mrna with a correlation coefficient of r2 =  <dig>  . translational states of individual transcripts for the excess glycerol, limiting glucose and methanol induction conditions were normalized to the excess glucose condition in order to identify transcripts with changed translational states . this identified an increased or decreased abundance of transcripts that are actively translated in the polysome fraction. translational states of individual genes ranged from  <dig> -fold  to  <dig> -fold . no transcripts were totally excluded from the polysome fractions, which is in agreement with a study published by arava et al.  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
translationally-enriched and depleted genes. bar chart representing the number of translationally enriched and depleted genes in excess glycerol, limiting glucose and methanol conditions related to the excess glucose condition .



only  <dig> transcripts had different translational states  in response to excess glycerol compared to the excess glucose condition, while more differences were found for the glucose-limited and methanol-grown cells. in excess glycerol-grown cells, rpl2a, tef <dig>  rps4b, eno <dig>  fba1- <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl11b and tdh <dig> had decreased translational states compared to cells grown in excess glucose. these genes are annotated with go terms “biosynthetic/metabolic process” and “translation”. both, the transcript level and the translational state was found to be decreased for transcripts of the glycolytic fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and phosphopyruvate hydratase  in excess glycerol. this suggests that specific translational down-regulation reinforces the transcriptional down-regulation of these genes in response to excess glycerol.

in methanol-grown cells, genes required for methanol utilization , were strongly up-regulated at the transcriptional level, but had a decreased translational state compared to excess glucose. hence translational regulation appears to counteract the strong transcriptional up-regulation of most of these genes. such "post-transcriptional buffering" has also been observed in two saccharomyces species  <cit> . neither significantly enriched go terms nor other patterns could be found in the other gene groups with altered translational states.

translational states are linked to orf length and transcript abundance
we analyzed the translation states of individual transcripts compared to total mrna for all growth conditions. enriched gene groups were initially identified ; closer inspection revealed that the groups had closely correlated open reading frame  lengths, which has been reported previously for other organisms  <cit> . liang et al.  <cit>  identified p. pastoris gene orfs, uorfs, utrs and introns by sequencing, and found orf lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, with an average of 1444 ± sd =  <dig> bp . we used this information to define three gene groups according to orf length : long and short genes, comprising the upper and lower quartile of all genes, and the remaining 50% of medium-length genes. translation efficiency is also known to be affected by codon usage, so we included synonymous codon usage order , which was obtained from the codono platform  <cit> ; higher values indicate more codon bias, meaning less random codon use in a gene’s coding region. the three gene groups significantly differ in transcript level, translational states, codon usage bias  and 5´utr frequency: short genes are highly transcribed  and translated , rarely possess a 5´utr and have an enhanced codon usage bias .table  <dig>

based on the information published by liang et al.  <cit> , all p. pastoris genes were split into  <dig> groups comprising the 25% longest , the 25% shortest  and the remaining  medium length genes. gene groups are not exactly the same size because they were split by length cut-off . 5′utr information was also taken from liang et al.  <cit> . expression intensities were obtained from our total rna microarray data which were normalized as described in the methods section. synonymous codon usage order  was obtained from the codono platform  <cit> .



statistical tests  were used to verify these relationships. orf length was shown to have a negative correlation with transcript abundance  and codon usage bias, so short genes are more highly transcribed than longer ones  and more codon biased . the correlation of orf length with translational states and 5′utr length was found to be significantly positive . hence, short genes are more-highly translated and rarely have a 5′utr, while longer genes are less-highly translated and often possess a 5′utr .figure  <dig>

genes. in contrast to genes with long coding sequences, shorter genes are more highly expressed, more efficiently translated, possess utr’s less frequently and are more codon biased than longer genes.



transcriptional regulation responding to different carbon sources correlates with expression of corresponding transcription factors
as mentioned above, excess glucose was used as a calibrator to calculate the transcriptional regulation in the other conditions . concerning global transcriptional control systems, we could identify p. pastoris gene expression responding to glucose repression, carbon catabolite repression elicited by excess glucose and glycerol, as well as control by methanol availability. limiting glucose triggers extensive transcriptional responses due to carbon limitation and low growth rate, which correlate well with the regulation patterns described by rebnegger et al.  <cit>  recently. corresponding to the important role of glycogen metabolism in slow growing conditions  <cit> , we found genes encoding glycogen synthase , phosphoglucomutase  and other glycogen metabolism genes  up-regulated in limiting glucose.

glucose repression signalling is mainly mediated through the central kinase snf <dig>  which controls the expression of important transcription factors such as mig <dig>  sip <dig>  rds <dig>  cat <dig> and adr <dig>  <cit> , thereby playing an important role in the utilization of non-fermentable carbon sources in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . we found the transcripts of many genes involved in catabolite repression to be induced in limiting glucose, especially cat8- <dig>  which is about 39-fold up-regulated compared to excess glucose . in addition, almost all genes that are reported to be controlled by cat <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  are also up-regulated.

interestingly,  <dig> homologs of mig <dig> are found in the p. pastoris genome, one of which is about 9-fold up-regulated in response to methanol and limiting glucose , while the second one is down-regulated on all other tested carbon sources compared to glucose ; it is possible that it acts as a carbon catabolite or glucose repressor similar to cre <dig> in trichoderma reesei  <cit>  or crea in aspergillus nidulans  <cit> .

the homologue of s. cerevisiae activator of ferrous transport, aft <dig>  was found to have induced expression levels in excess glycerol, methanol and limiting glucose conditions and has been reported to play a role in the regulation of carbon repressed genes in p. pastoris recently  <cit> . the transcription factors pas_chr4_ <dig>  cth <dig>  pas_chr1-1_ <dig>  pas_chr3_ <dig>  pas_chr1-1_ <dig> were related to excess conditions.

among the most strongly-induced genes in methanol and limiting glucose conditions, several transcription factors are present . of these, the zn2cys <dig> zinc cluster protein pas_chr3_ <dig>  which has an 80-fold higher transcript level on methanol and 120-fold higher transcript level under limiting glucose compared to excess glucose, has significant sequence homology to h. polymorpha mpp <dig>  <cit> . mpp <dig> was suggested to be the master regulator of methanol-responsive genes in h. polymorpha  <cit> . since pas_chr3_ <dig> is also located in a similar chromosomal arrangement  to h. polymorpha, we propose that it is the p. pastoris homologue of hpmpp <dig>  ppmxr <dig> encoding a transcription factor that is necessary for the activation of many genes in response to methanol  <cit>  is induced in all three conditions compared to excess glucose. we suggest that ppmxr <dig>  similar to its s. cerevisiae homolog adr <dig>  is needed for the activation  of genes for alternative carbon sources including the mut genes that are repressed in the presence of excess glucose and glycerol, but that mpp <dig> is the transcriptional activator of peroxisomal import and matrix proteins required for methanol utilization in p. pastoris. this awaits experimental verification in future.table  <dig>

we found glycolytic p. pastoris genes involved in upper and lower glycolysis to have lower expression levels in all three conditions compared to excess glucose. glycolytic genes are known to be weakly regulated at the level of transcription in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , but transcriptional regulation has been previously described for crabtree-negative yeasts such as p. pastoris and k. lactis, and was assumed to coincide with their limited glucose uptake  <cit> . as expected, the genes encoding the key gluconeogenic enzymes fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  and pep carboxykinase  are less expressed in excess glucose . the transition between those two pathways is associated with gid2/rmd5-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome linked elimination of the key enzyme fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  <cit> . vid24/gid <dig>  encodes a previously-identified key regulator of gid2/rmd <dig> that is strongly up-regulated in methanol fed cells. a hypothetical gene , also strongly induced on methanol and limiting glucose, could encode the homolog of rmd5: it contains a c3hc <dig> ring finger domain.

in s. cerevisiae, fermentative glucose- or catabolite-repressed growth is described for cells grown on excess glucose  <cit> . upon glucose depletion or in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources, such as glycerol or ethanol, extensive reprogramming of gene expression allows s. cerevisiae to take up alternative carbon sources and enhances activity of the glyoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylic acid  cycle and gluconeogenesis  <cit> . we found several p. pastoris genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of alternative carbon sources to be less expressed during growth on glycerol, methanol and/or limiting glucose . among them, the non-annotated orfs pas_chr4_ <dig>  pas_chr4_ <dig> and pas_chr4_ <dig> could be identified to be homologs of lra <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the encoded enzymes are part of the alternative pathway of l-rhamnose catabolism present in pichia  stipitis  <cit>  and most probably allow p. pastoris to utilize rhamnose as sole carbon source  <cit> . interestingly, pplra <dig> and  <dig> flank an uncharacterized fungal-specific zn2/cys <dig> transcription factor , which is up-regulated in response to methanol and limiting glucose . increased transcript levels in comparison to excess glucose can also be seen for many tca cycle genes, isocitrate lyase  involved in the glyoxylate cycle  and genes involved in channeling alternative carbon sources into the tca cycle . interestingly, some genes encoding proteins present as isoenzymes such as aco1/ <dig>  ipd1/ <dig> and acs1/ <dig> are oppositely regulated in all the de-repressed conditions.

respiration is repressed in excess glucose conditions during fermentative growth in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , thus respiration-associated functions such as oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial electron transport and atp generation are induced upon glucose depletion. unlike s. cerevisiae, crabtree-negative yeasts are dependent on respiratory processes even in excess glucose. consequently, the expression of mitochondrial genes is not induced in the presence of non-fermentable carbon-sources in p. pastoris . however, several subunits of respiratory complex i  <cit> , which is not present in s. cerevisiae, appear to be de-repressed.

methanol utilization and peroxisomal genes are subject to carbon substrate repression
unexpectedly, the transcript levels of most genes involved in methanol utilization  are not only highly induced in methanol-grown cells but also in glucose-limited cells . the transcript level of aox <dig> is almost equally high in both conditions. this observation correlates well with pre-induction expression from the aox <dig> promoter in the glycerol-fed batch prior to methanol addition  <cit> , and high aox <dig> protein levels in glucose-limited chemostats  <cit> . repression of aox <dig> expression was previously determined in p. pastoris grown on glucose, glycerol, ethanol and acetate  <cit> , with glycerol repression being specific for p. pastoris aox1/ <dig>  but not for alcohol oxidase genes in related yeasts such as h. polymorpha or c. boidinii  <cit> .table  <dig>

although it was assumed that some mut genes might also be regulated by catabolite de-repression  <cit> , the extent of this regulatory pathway has not been shown experimentally in p. pastoris. early observations reported that the mrna levels of aox <dig> upon de-repression was only 1-2% of the methanol-induced mrna levels  <cit> , while fld expression was assumed not to be under glucose repression control  <cit> . on the contrary we see a high level of de-repression in cells grown on limiting glucose . this contradiction might be explained by the fact that in our set up, the cells are actively growing, while previous experiments employed glucose-exhausted stationary-phase cells for studies of de-repression. upon  methanol addition e.g. in fed batch or chemostat, mut gene transcript levels are on average 55-fold higher compared to glucose-limited growth conditions . however, our data highlight that different degrees of carbon catabolite repression are acting on individual mut genes; for example das1/ <dig> are less de-repressed than aox1/ <dig>  this strongly points towards – yet unidentified –transcriptional regulators being involved in induction/repression of the individual mut genes in addition to the global methanol regulator ppmxr <dig> . induction of peroxisomal protein synthesis was observed in s. cerevisiae grown on glycerol as sole carbon source  <cit> , which appears to be different from the situation in p. pastoris. in the present study, up-regulation of peroxisomal gene transcript levels occurs in glucose-limited and methanol-grown cells but not in excess glycerol , which may also be associated with the specific repression exerted by glycerol on mut gene expression; it might be speculated that the zinc cluster protein cat8- <dig>  is the responsible transcription factor for this.

peroxisomal processes such as methanol utilization and beta-oxidation are associated with the formation of h2o <dig>  requiring the action of antioxidants. yap <dig>  the oxidative stress response transcription factor, and many of its target genes  <cit>  were found to be significantly up-regulated in methanol-grown cells and/or more pronounced in limiting glucose. while it was previously shown that yap <dig> is required for ros detoxification and sufficient growth on methanol  <cit> , the strong up-regulation of yap <dig> in glucose-limited conditions was unexpected. interestingly, starvation is linked to the expression of genes encoding oxidative stress functions in bacteria and yeast  <cit> . the protective effect of antioxidants is proposed to have a beneficial effect in cells with nutrient limitation.

the expression of fatty acid β-oxidation genes is up-regulated in p. pastoris cells responding to limiting glucose
peroxisomal protein expression and fatty acid oxidation were previously reported to be regulated by snf <dig> kinase through adr <dig> action  <cit> . at least three other transcription factors act in concert with adr <dig> in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , but two of them – oaf <dig> and pip <dig> – cannot be found in p. pastoris. instead, the putative fungal specific transcription factor pas_chr1-3_ <dig>  represents a homolog to fara/b, the transcriptional activators of fatty acid utilization in aspergillus spp., and c. albicans and y. lipolytica ctf <dig>  <cit> . the elevated transcript levels of pas_chr1-3_ <dig> in limiting glucose are reflected by the strong induction of fatty acid utilization genes . a similar regulation pattern was also observed for the non-annotated genes pas_chr2-1_ <dig>  pas_fragb_ <dig>  pas_chr2-2_ <dig> and pas_chr1-1_ <dig>  indicating a possible involvement in beta-oxidation. indeed, pas_fragb_ <dig>  pas_chr2-1_ <dig> and pas_chr1-1_ <dig> contain predicted pts <dig> targeting signals  <cit> , the latter having strong sequence homology to the peroxisome-targeted non-specific lipid transfer protein pox <dig> present in candida tropicalis and candida maltosa  <cit> . additionally, many genes connected to synthesis and degradation of triacylglycerol  are regulated mainly in response to limiting glucose, which probably leads to the accumulation of free fatty acids which can then be degraded by beta-oxidation. genes encoding fatty acid synthases  needed for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis are only up-regulated in methanol-grown cells, while all sterol biosynthesis genes with the exception of erg <dig>  which encodes the first step of the pathway , are down-regulated in limiting glucose. potential interaction partners which are also strongly induced in glucose-limited and methanol-grown cells could be the putative transcription factor sut <dig>  and mpp <dig>  which was previously described to regulate peroxisomal matrix proteins and peroxins in hansenula polymorpha  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our current knowledge of translational regulation comes from studies on s. cerevisiae cells  <cit> , where stress conditions have been found to induce a global translational down-regulation that is mediated by translation initiation factors . the specific regulation of defined mrnas is dependent on regulatory utr- binding protein complexes and mirnas  <cit> . a significant finding emerging from this work is that the response of p. pastoris to different carbon sources  is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. furthermore, we found translational regulation to be global rather than transcript-specific in the analyzed conditions.

strikingly, cells grown on excess glycerol or glucose have a very similar transcriptome in contrast to the situation in s. cerevisiae, which undergoes extensive changes when shifting between those two catabolites  <cit> . we have also identified genes that are subject to glucose repression in p. pastoris. global gene regulation patterns in glucose-limited cells differ strongly from cells grown in excess glycerol, which is a de-repressing carbon source. while this may be partly associated with the reduced growth rate of glucose-limited cells, transcriptional de-repression of genes of the methanol utilization pathway, peroxisome biogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation is specific to glucose-limited growth . the transcription factor responsible for this regulatory function remain to be identified.

finally, we have shown that translational regulation is global rather than transcript-specific for p. pastoris cells in different growth conditions. cells growing on methanol exhibited the highest p:m ratio – which might also account for the superior protein production capacities observed in this condition. despite the lower growth rate, transcription of genes encoding ribosomal constituents and parts of the translational machinery is not affected on methanol, indicating an increased global translation which is also reflected in the degree of polysome-associated mrnas in the polysome profiles. the high abundance of methanol utilization enzymes  <cit>  in combination with peroxisome proliferation  <cit>  increases the burden on the translation machinery in methanol-grown cells. indeed, p. pastoris has increased cellular protein content during methylotrophic growth .
