BACKGROUND
tuberculosis is still one of the leading causes of mortality throughout the world. the hiv/aids pandemic, the deterioration of public health systems in developing countries, and the emergence of multi-drug resistance of untreatable forms of tuberculosis have further contributed to that spread. infection by the causative agent of tuberculosis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, is achieved by strategies involving uptake and replication of the bacterium in host macrophages and the weakening or modification of the host immune response  <cit> . in recent years, there has been a considerable advance in the understanding of the molecular bases of pathogenicity, virulence and persistence of mycobacteria. one significant contribution to this knowledge has been the identification of essential proteins for mycobacterial virulence. the mce  proteins are a group of secreted or surface-exposed proteins encoded by mce genes. these genes are situated in operons, comprising eight genes, organized in exactly the same manner. m. tuberculosis has four mce loci: mce <dig>  mce <dig>  mce <dig> and mce <dig>  the name of these proteins is derived from the function firstly assigned to mce <dig>  related to the ability of mycobacteria to enter mammalian cells and survive inside macrophages  <cit> . mce operons with an identical structure have been identified in all mycobacterium species examined, as well as in other species of actinomycetales  <cit> . a considerable number of studies have demonstrated that mce proteins are related to the virulence of each member of the m. tuberculosis complex. flesselles et al.  <cit>  have reported that a bcg strain mutated in mce <dig> exhibits a reduced ability to invade the non-phagocytic epithelial cell line hela. sassetti and rubin  <cit>  have then found that mce <dig> disruption causes attenuation of m. tuberculosis. further studies have shown that a strain knockout in mce <dig> has reduced ability to multiply when inoculated by the intratracheal route in mice. however, the same mce <dig> mutant strain is hypervirulent when inoculated intraperitoneally in mice. moreover, shimono et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that a strain of m. tuberculosis mutant in the mce <dig> operon can kill mice more rapidly than the wild type strain after intravenous inoculation. variations in the level of virulence depending on the route of bacterial inoculation have also been observed in mutants of the mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons when assessed in mice  <cit> , suggesting that m. tuberculosis regulates the expression of mce proteins to adapt to the variety of environmental host conditions. consistently with this presumption, regulatory proteins that control the transcription of mce <dig>  mce <dig> and mce <dig> have been identified in m. tuberculosis.

in a previous study, we have demonstrated that mce2r , the first open reading frame of the mce <dig> operon, encodes for a mce2-specific gntr transcriptional repressor  <cit> . this regulator poorly controls the expression of mce <dig> proteins during the in vitro growth of m. tuberculosis in rich media  <cit> , suggesting that mce2r control the expression of mce <dig> when the bacteria encounter a particular growth-restricted environment. in order to test this possibility, in this study we compared the replication of m. tuberculosis in mice in the absence and in the presence of mce2r. the genes regulated by mce2r and the role of this regulator in the maturation of the m. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes in macrophages was also investigated.

RESULTS
deletion of mce2r in m. tuberculosis
the mce2r gene  of m. tuberculosis h37rv was knocked out by replacing bases  <dig> to  <dig> of the gene with a hygromycin-resistance cassette. the integrity of the resulting mce2r mutant strain was then confirmed by polymerase chain reaction . figure 1a shows that no amplification product was detected in the mutant strain, with primers that hybridise within the deleted region of mce2r, and that a product of approximately 300 bp, corresponding to the central region of mce2r, was amplified in the wild-type strain. using primers that hybridise 980 bp from the 5′ end of mce2r and inside the hygromycin resistance genes, an amplicon of expected size  was detected only in the mtΔmce2r mutant strain. in order to evaluate the effect of the deletion in mce2r on the expression of mce <dig> operon, changes in mrna levels were monitored by quantitative real time pcr  in the wild type and in the mtΔmce2r mutant strains. results showed a significant increase in the level of transcription of yrbe2a and mce2a  in the mtΔmce2r mutant strain compared to the wild type during in vitro culture , thus confirming that mce2r acts as a transcriptional repressor of the mce <dig> operon. importantly, the reintroduction of mce2r significantly decreased the transcription of the mce <dig> genes in the mutant strain . since our earlier work had shown that mce2r and the mce <dig> operon are co-transcribed  <cit> , the decreased transcription of the mce <dig> genes in the complemented strain further indicates that the upregulation of the mce <dig> gene in the knockout mutant was not the result of a polar effect of the disruption of mce2r but rather the consequence of a loss of repression by the regulator.

*values were not statistically different between strains.

the values indicate the average ratios of mtΔmce2r/m. tuberculosis h37rv or mtΔmce2r comp/m. tuberculosis h37rv for four independent biological replicates.

the growth profiles of the wild type, mutant and complemented strains under in vitro standard culture conditions showed similar doubling times. thus, the mutation of the mce2r gene does not appear to compromise the in vitro growth of m. tuberculosis .

overexpression of mce2r reduces m. tuberculosis replication in a mouse model of infection
in order to examine the infection and survival pattern of the mtΔmce2r mutant in vivo, we used the intratracheal route to infect balb/c mice  <cit> , and determined lung colonization by counting bacterial colony forming units . at  <dig> and 35 days post-infection, the number of cfus in lungs of animals inoculated with the mtΔmce2r mutant was equivalent than that of the animals inoculated with the parental strain . however, the introduction of a constitutively expressed mce2r gene into the mtΔmce2r mutant  significantly reduced the replication of m. tuberculosis in lungs at  <dig> and 35 days post-infection . this result led us to hypothesize that the expression of the mce <dig> operon was over-repressed in the complemented strain due to the overexpression of mce2r. to test this possibility, we assessed the in vitro expression of mce2r and yrbe2a in the complemented and the wild type strains at both the early and late exponential phases of bacterial growth. the level of transcription of mce2r in the complemented strain was higher than in the wild type strain  at the exponential and stationary growth phases . at the early exponential phase, the differences in the amount of yrbe2a mrna between both strains were not statistically significant whereas at the late exponential phase there was a significant reduction in yrbe2a mrna  in the complemented strain as compared with that in the wild type strain .

the lack of mce2r only affects the expression of mce <dig> operon during the in vitro culture of m. tuberculosis
to define the mce2r regulon we performed a whole-genome in vitro expression profiling on the mutant and wild-type parental h37rv strains. the analysis of gene expression data showed that about  <dig> % of all genes showed fold changes equal or greater than  <dig>   , indicating that most of the genes were similarly expressed in the mutant and the wild type strains. we found only  <dig> genes that were overexpressed in mtΔmce2r with fold changes > <dig> .

a subset of those genes that were upregulated in the mtΔmce2r mutant strain in the microarray experiments was assessed by rt-qpcr. only the mce <dig> genes were significantly upregulated in the mutant strain . the other genes that were overexpressed in the microarray experiment showed even lower and/or non-significant fold changes in the rt-qpcr assays , with the exception of rv <dig> that was downregulated in both the microarray and rt-qpcr experiments . altogether, these results indicate that in standard in vitro culture conditions mce2r mainly regulates the expression of the mce <dig> operon.

overexpression of mce2r reduces the arrest of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes
we next evaluated the maturation stage of mycobacterial phagosomes using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. m. tuberculosis strains were used to infect j <dig> macrophages for 1 hour of uptake and two hours of chase as described in material and methods and processed for microscopy.

in three of four independent experiments, the fraction of lysosomal-associated membrane protein  <dig> -positive phagosomes was slightly, but significantly , lower in cells infected with mtΔmce2r, as compared to the wild-type strain . consistently with the in vivo replication experiments, overexpression of mce2r in the complemented strain significantly increases the maturation of m. tuberculosis-containing phagosome . these results suggest that mce2r regulon participates in the phagosomal arrest induced by intracellular m. tuberculosis to survive and replicate inside macrophages  <cit> . in order to know the contribution of mce <dig> operon to the phagosome arresting we evaluated the association of lamp- <dig> marker with phagosomes containing a m. tuberculosis mce2-knockout . in two independent experiments the number of lamp-2-positive phagosomes were higher  in cells infected with mtΔmce <dig> than in those infected with the wild-type strain , indicating that mce <dig> operon encodes proteins with a role in phagosome arresting.

discussion
in the present study we demonstrated that the knockout of the transcriptional repressor mce2r does not affect the replication of m. tuberculosis in mouse lungs. this finding suggests that similarly to that observed for the in vitro growth of m. tuberculosis, mce2r weakly represses the in vivo expression of the mce <dig> virulence operon, likely due to the fact that this repressor negatively regulates its own expression. remarkably, when the transcription of mce2r was conducted by a strong and desregulated promoter, the resulting complemented strain expressed higher levels of mce2r mrna than the wild type strain, and was significantly more attenuated than the mutant m. tuberculosis strain, in terms of bacterial replication in lungs. thus, these observations may indicate that, during the in vivo infection, the expression of the mce <dig> operon is more effectively repressed in the complemented strain than in the wild type strain. in in vitro growth conditions, the expression of yrbe2a was significantly repressed in the complemented strain only at the stationary growth phase, suggesting that mce2r could effectively repress the transcription of the mce <dig> operon when a substantial level of this repressor is accumulated. this in vitro mce <dig> expression profile supports the hypothesis that increasing bacterial attenuation along the infection is a consequence of an increasing reduction of the expression of the mce <dig> operon. importantly, the results of this study are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that a mutation in the mce <dig> operon impairs either the replication or the lethality of m. tuberculosis in mouse models  <cit> .

we also defined the in vitro mce2r regulon by whole genome microarray analysis and determined that the genes whose expressions were significantly affected by the transcriptional regulator were confined to those belonging to the mce <dig> operon. surprisingly, the expression of the end gene, which has been suggested to be regulated by mce2r  <cit> , showed no changes in expression in the mutant strain compared to the wild type. this difference is probably a reflection of the different experimental setups in each study. while in the present study the conditions used to study gene expression were based on the absence or presence of mce2r, our previous study investigated the effect of modulating the expression of mce2r. the expression rv <dig>  which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator, was slightly reduced in the mutant strain, suggesting that the lack of mce2r indirectly affects the expression of rv <dig>  however, the low fold change detected for this gene in both experimental strategies places in doubt the biological significance of this differential expression. the type of exclusive in vitro regulation of mce2r over the mce <dig> operon contrasts to that described for mce3r, the transcriptional repressor of the mce <dig> operon  <cit> . whereas during the in vitro growth of m. tuberculosis, mce3r negatively regulates the expression of two transcriptional units likely to be involved in lipid or isoprenoid modifications  <cit> , mce2r seems to regulate exclusively the transcription of mce <dig>  our findings thus suggest that the higher virulence of the mutant mtΔmce2r strain  is, at least in part, a consequence of the overexpression of the mce <dig> operon.

one of the main mechanisms elicited by intracellular mycobacteria to survive and replicate inside the host cells is to arrest the normal process of phagosome maturation, which enables bacterial survival in a non-acidified intracellular compartment  <cit> . proteins involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall lipids, such as phop  <cit>  and ag85a  <cit> , have shown to have a role in the phagosome arresting exerted by m. tuberculosis. likely, these proteins are not direct modulators of phagosome trafficking, instead they would participate in the synthesis of compounds that are actually implicated in this cellular process. for instance, the synthesis of cell wall trehalose dimycolate and the sulfolipids is regulated by the two-component system phop/phor and these lipids have been described as implicated in blocking phagosome/lysosome fusion induced by m. tuberculosis <cit> . however, a recent report has suggested the opposite, showing that overproduction of the sulfoglycolipids , ac3sgl and ac4sgl in the m. tuberculosis rv1503c::tn and rv1506c::tn strains increases the intracellular trafficking to lysosomes of these mutant strains. in connection with this last finding, previous reports have suggested a role of the proteins encoded in the mce <dig> operon in the sulpholipid metabolism/transport. firstly, marjanovic et al. have shown that a m. tuberculosis deleted in mce <dig> operon accumulates more sulpholipids  than it parental h37rv strain, proposing that the mce <dig> operon encodes proteins involved in the metabolism/transport of sls  <cit> . secondly, the finding that sigma factor l seems to regulate the expression of mce <dig> genes and genes encoding enzymes implicated in sl synthesis and the fact that the mce <dig> operon is absent in mycobacterium smegmatis <cit> , which does not produce sl- <dig>  <cit> , also support a role of mce <dig> proteins in the transport of sls. based on these previous observations and the results of this study, we can speculate that lack of mce <dig> proteins  increases the accumulation of sls in the bacteria, disfavouring the arrest of phagosome maturation and in turn the survival of both the mutant mtΔmce <dig>  <cit>  and the complemented mtΔmce2comp in mouse lungs. however, the higher maturation of phagosomes containing the over-repressed strain  as compared to that of phagosomes containing mtΔmce <dig>  may indicate that other in vivo mce2r-regulated genes can also participate in the phagosome arresting induced by intracellular m. tuberculosis. whether the mutation of mce2r affects the accumulation of sls in m. tuberculosis will require further investigation and is beyond the scope of the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study demonstrate that, in standard conditions of in vitro culture, mce2r mainly regulates the expression of the mce <dig> operon and support a role of the proteins regulated by this transcriptional repressor in the virulence of m. tuberculosis. in addition, we showed that this role in the virulence for mce2r regulon takes place in part through interfering with the normal maturation of phagosomes. however, further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of regulation exerted by mce2r and the role of mce2r regulon in the survival of m. tuberculosis inside the host.
