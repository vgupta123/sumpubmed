BACKGROUND
actinomycetes are especially important in producing various bioactive secondary metabolites, including well-known antibiotics such as chloramphenicol  <cit>  and anticancer molecules such as rebeccamycin  <cit> . actinomycetes isolated from terrestrial environments have been well studied, which results in frequent rediscovery of known natural products  <cit> . in contrast, marine actinomycetes from the deep ocean or the polar regions are mostly untapped resources  <cit> . currently, new actinomycetes have been described from the arctic and antarctica, using cultivation-dependent and -independent approaches . an increasing number of natural products have been reported from marine actinomycetes as well  <cit> .

to meet the urgent medical needs of drug candidates, advanced approaches are required to improve the efficiency of natural product discovery . generally, similar secondary metabolites are biosynthesized by gene clusters that contain certain homologous genes  <cit> . the presence of marker genes, such as polyketide synthase , non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  genes and tailoring enzyme genes, may indicate production of certain secondary metabolites. therefore, pcr-based marker gene screening is an efficient way to find promising natural products from the environment  <cit> .

halogenation catalyzed by halogenases is an important tailoring step for bioactivities of many natural products  <cit> . halogenated natural products span from simple halogenated indoles, terpenes and phenols to complex oligopeptides and polyketides. halogenated compounds are important sources for new drugs, due to their high diversity in structure and activity. more than  <dig>  halogenated compounds have been reported, showing diverse biological activities and structures  <cit> . some of them have been used for decades as pharmaceuticals. for example, the well-known antibiotic chloramphenicol  <cit> , the antitumor agent rebeccamycin  <cit>  and the antifugal antibiotic pyrrolnitrin  <cit>  have been used widely in clinic or currently under clinical trials. therefore, exploration of halometabolites is an important and promising approach to discover new drugs. in addition to potential biotechnological applications, antibiotics including halometabolites are considered to be bacterial weapons for fighting competitors in the indigenous ecosystems or signals regulating the homeostasis of the microbial communities  <cit> . therefore, they may also have important ecological functions. halogenase is a key tailoring enzyme in producing halometabolites in nature and can be used to explore halometabolites. currently, halogenases can be divided into two types  <cit> . one type is highly substrate-specific, including flavin adenine dinucleotide -dependent halogenases , non-heme feii/α-ketoglutarate halogenases and sam-dependent halogenases. the other type is haloperoxidases that generally lack of substrate specificity. fdhs are the major type of halogenases involved in biosynthesis of halometabolites, and are usually indicative of halometabolite types . one group of well-studied fdhs is tryptophan halogenases  that regioselectively halogenate tryptophan .

halogenases from the polar regions and deep sea have been much less investigated than from terrestrial environments and coasts. pcr-based screening of fdhs has been conducted to study marine sponge-associated microbial consortia  <cit>  and actinomycetes from various terrestrial and other environments  <cit> . fadh2-dependent halogenases have been studied in detail from marine and soil actinomycetes, such as amycolatopsis  <cit>  and streptomyces  <cit> , in the context of related gene clusters. however, fdhs from the polar regions are poorly investigated. the arctic attracts increasing attention due to its unique environmental conditions and strategic importance. bioprospecting has been carried out in the arctic for microorganisms in biotechnology  <cit> . however, few reports have been involved in halogenases. previously, we detected halogenase genes from arctic actinomycetes without gene cloning and sequencing  <cit> . in this study, we screened fdhs from actinomycetes isolated from marine sediments of the high arctic, and sequenced them for the first time. novel fdh genes were further cloned to obtain the full coding sequences for analysis. in addition, genome sequencing was performed to discover a cryptic gene cluster predicted to produce an unknown halometabolite. our study showed that halogenase genes are helpful in bioprospecting arctic actinomycetes. great genetic potential of halometabolite production can be expected from the arctic actinomycetes.

RESULTS
bioprospecting for halogenase-containing actinomycetes
pcr-based screening was very efficient for bioprospecting of halogenase-containing actinomycetes. nine out of  <dig> strains were discovered to contain halogenase genes. the  <dig> investigated actinomycetes strains were mostly streptomyces, with a few exceptions belonging to nocardiopsis, pseudonocardia and brevibacterium . moderate frequency of occurrence of halogenases was observed in arctic actinomycetes, compared with actinomycetes from other environments  <cit> . the nine strains were distributed at various water depths in the arctic ocean , ranging from shallow  to deep  marine sediments. they grew well at 15 °c in ispii medium , with the optimum temperature around  <dig> to 25 °c. no correlation between phylogenetic distances and geographic distribution was observed . the nine halogenase-containing strains were grouped into two genera, streptomyces  and nocardiopsis  . it agreed with previous studies that streptomyces was the major genus containing halogenases and also one of the most important producers of halometabolites  <cit> . nocardiopsis is less commonly found containing halogenases. indeed, no halometabolites have been reported from nocardiopsis to the best of our knowledge. however, higher occurrence of halogenases was observed in nocardiopsis  than in streptomyces  in our study , even though the sample size was not large enough to show statistical significance. in addition, the two nocardiopsis strains were isolated from deep-sea sediments of the arctic ocean. hence, the detection of two halogenase-containing nocardiopsis strains is of interest and worthy of further investigation.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of 16s rrna genes of halogenase-positive strains and their closest type strains



the closest type cultures of the nine strains are shown in the phylogenetic tree , sharing  <dig> to 100 % 16s rrna gene identities. the seven streptomyces strains could be clustered into three subgroups in the phylogenetic tree based on 16s rrna genes . to identify whether halogenase genes are present in the closely related strains, we searched the ncbi databases for genome and halogenase sequences of them. only one genome of closely related strains was sequenced, i.e., nocardiopsis lucentensis dsm  <dig>  however, no halogenase genes were found in the draft genome of nocardiopsis lucentensis dsm  <dig> . in addition, no halogenase genes were reported from the remaining closely related strains.

analysis of putative halogenase partial sequences
the nine partial putative halogenase genes were amplified by different degenerative primer pairs , with five genes amplified by sz002/sz003/sz <dig>  three genes amplified by halo-b4-fw/halo-b7-rv, and one gene amplified by trp-rw/trp-rv . it seems that different primer pairs have unequal efficiency, probably related to primer sequences and the conserved domains targeted. hence, it suggests that more primers used for screening can improve the opportunity of finding halogenases. in addition, false positives occurred more frequently using the primer pairs halo-b4-fw/halo-b7-rv and sz002/sz003/sz <dig> than using the primer pairs trp-rw/trp-rv designed in this study. screening of halogenase genes only based on electrophoresis of pcr products is not reliable. further cloning and sequencing are required to confirm the presence of halogenase genes.table  <dig> degenerative primers used for screening of halogenase genes

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of partial halogenase genes based on dna sequences



the nine partially sequenced fdhs could be clustered into two groups based on dna sequences, trp-halogenases  and non-trp-halogenases  . high homology was shared by halogenase genes from strains with different phylogenetic affiliation. for example, streptomyces sp. 514 f shared almost identical partial halogenase gene  with nocardiopsis sp. 531 f . streptomyces strains 551 f, 545 f and 543 f had nearly identical halogenase partial sequences . in addition, streptomyces strains 620 f and 604 f contained 99 % identical partial halogenase sequences . therefore, halogenases may have complex evolutionary history.

representative halogenase partial genes were compared against the ncbi genbank database to search for homologs. the partial halogenase of streptomyces sp. 531 f  shared 96 % nucleotide identity and 98 % amino acid identity with trp-halogenase from sphingomonas melonis . the closest relative of the partial halogenase from streptomyces sp. 623 f  was trp-halogenases from brevundimonas sp. ds <dig>  . interestingly, the closest relatives of phal <dig> and phal <dig> are halogenases from alphaproteobacteria rather than actinomycetes. in addition, these alphaproteobacterial halogenases were either partially cloned or predicted by genome sequencing. moreover, the alphaproteobacterial halogenases were not located in any potential biosynthetic gene clusters. it raises the question of roles played by halogenases in non-actinomycetes, such as alphaproteobacteria that are not perceived commonly as a natural product-producing group. whether halogenases in alphaproteobacteria are involved in halometabolite production is still unknown. the closest biochemically characterized halogenases of phal <dig> and phal <dig> were halogenase rebh from lechevalieria aerocolonigenes atcc  <dig>   <cit>  and halogenase thal from streptomyces albogriseolus   <cit> , sharing less than 40 % nucleotide and amino acid identities. hence, phal <dig> and phal <dig> showed some novelty in sequence and probably in physiological roles as well.

phal <dig>  representative of phal <dig> and phal <dig>  had highest homology  with three tryptophan 6-halogenases of streptomyces from mangrove soil. these closest strains are streptomyces fungicidicus strains mgr <dig>  and mgr <dig> , and streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus strain mgr <dig> . however, neither genomes of these mangrove strains were sequenced, nor further studies on their halogenases were published. therefore, no information of potential gene clusters or products could be obtained from these highly identical halogenases. nevertheless, phal <dig> showed significant identities with halogenases known to be involved in biosynthesis of identified halometabolites. for example, phal <dig> had 71 % nucleotide identity and 70 % amino acid identity with thal from streptomyces albogriseolus . it also showed 75 % nucleotide identity and 70 % amino acid identity with rebh from lechevalieria aerocolonigenes atcc  <dig> . therefore, phal <dig> may resemble the characterized trp-halogenases, indicating that similar biosynthesis could occur in strain 551 f.

the three non-trp-halogenases shared high identities with putative halogenases from actinomycetes but low identities with halogenases catalyzing recognized halometabolites. the partial halogenase of nocardiopsis sp. 597 f  shared 98 % nucleotide identity and 97 % amino acid identity with putative halogenases from streptomyces sp. nrrl f- <dig>  and streptomyces griseus . however, phal <dig> shared only 54 % nucleotide identity and 56 % amino acid identity with the halogenase  characterized from actinosynnema pretiosum  <cit> . phal <dig> and phal <dig> shared 99 % nucleotide and amino acid identities with halogenase of streptomyces sp. l <dig> , but were distinct from halogenases involved in biosynthesis of known halometabolites.

analysis and implication of the full-length halogenase genes
since the partial halogenases showed promising novelty and diversity, representatives were chosen to clone full coding sequences. four full-length halogenase genes were cloned based on genome walking of partial sequences from streptomyces strains 604 f and 551 f, as well as nocardiopsis strains 597 f and 531 f. both nocardiopsis strains and streptomyces sp. 551 f were isolated from deep-sea sediments from the high arctic, while streptomyces sp. 604 f was obtained at a shallower depth. halogenases were reported to usually occur in gene clusters for biosynthesis of related secondary metabolites. thus, a phylogenetic tree was built for the four complete halogenases and the previously identified halogenases from known biosynthetic gene clusters .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the full-length halogenases and previous halogenases identified in halometabolite biosynthesis. phylogenetic tree was built using amino acid sequences. protein symbols/names, the producing strains, genbank accession numbers in parentheses, and the corresponding halometabolites underlined were given in order



the complete halogenase gene  of streptomyces sp. 551 f was similar to trp-halogenases involved in biosynthesis of well-known halometabolites. the hal <dig> gene contained  <dig>  bp encoding  <dig> amino acids. it shared 85 % amino acid identity with multiple putative trp-halogenases from genome sequencing of streptomyces and 71 % amino acid identity with thal from streptomyces albogriseolus   <cit> . thal was a 6-trp-halogenase that regioselectively catalyzed chlorination or bromination at the 6-position of tryptophan to produce thienodolin, a growth-regulating factor in plants  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree showed that hal <dig> was phylogenetically related to rebh  from lechevalieria aerocolonigenes atcc  <dig>   <cit> . rebh was a trp-halogenase selectively catalyzing the halogenation of 7-position of tryptophan during the biosynthesis of rebeccamycin. in addition, hal <dig> clustered with other known trp-halogenases, which regioselectively acted on the  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> position of tryptophan. therefore, hal <dig> is predicted to regioselectively catalyze tryptophan to produce final halometabolites.

hal <dig> was probably a new kind of trp-halogenase. it lay outside of the identified trp-halogenases and hal <dig> in the phylogenetic tree, but was not related to non-trp-halogenases. the complete gene still had highest identity with halogenases from alphaproteobacteria, but remotely related to actinobacterial halogenases as shown in the tree . it indicates that hal <dig> likely represents an ancestral form of trp-halogenases that originated from non-actinomycetes such as alphaproteobacteria. however, this hypothesis requires further investigation. since the function of these closely related halogenases in alphaproteobacteria is unknown, it is of interest to examine the roles of hal <dig> in nocardiopsis sp. 531 f.

hal <dig> was a non-trp-halogenase that implied the potential of halometabolite biosynthesis of strain 597 f. the complete gene consisted of  <dig>  bp encoding  <dig> amino acids. hal <dig> had highest amino acid identity  with two putative halogenases in the draft genomes of streptomyces sp. nrrl f- <dig>  and streptomyces griseus nrrl f- <dig> . the two streptomyces genomes were highly similar, especially the two contigs  containing the halogenases. however, no information on the two streptomyces genomes as well as the halogenases has been published in the literature. in addition to the unidentified putative halogenases, hal <dig> shared 54 % amino acid identity with the halogenase  from actinosynnema pretiosum subsp. auranticum atcc  <dig>  asm <dig> was identified in the biosynthetic gene cluster of the maytansinoid antitumor agent ansamitocin  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree also showed that hal <dig> clustered with asm <dig> with 100 % bootstrap support. ansamitocin was 19-membered macrocyclic lactams, with chlorine at position c- <dig> of an aromatic ring. the biosynthetic gene cluster of ansamitocin was split into two parts, which is uncommon. further investigation of hal <dig> in the context of genome would provide more information on its possible gene cluster and potential products.

hal <dig> was predicted to be related to peptide-like halometabolite biosynthesis. the complete gene was  <dig>  bp in length encoding  <dig> amino acids, highly similar with the halogenase gene previously cloned from this strain in our lab  <cit> . hal <dig> shared 99 % amino acid identity with two putative halogenases in genomes of streptomyces sp. gba 94– <dig>  and streptomyces sp. pva 94– <dig>  isolated from a sponge. the two draft genomes were highly similar and contained almost identical halogenases as well as same flanking genes. the halogenases were located in putative gene clusters which probably produce glycopeptide-like secondary metabolites, as analyzed in antismash  <cit> . in addition, hal <dig> had 58 % amino acid identity with two halogenases of actinoplanes sp. atcc  <dig>  which were identified in the biosynthesis of the sulfated glycopeptide uk- <dig>   <cit> . moreover, hal <dig> clustered with halogenases involved in biosynthesis of vancomycin  <cit> , balhimycin  <cit> , teicoplanin  <cit> , a <dig>  <cit>  and complestatin  <cit> , with 100 % bootstrap support in the tree. these products were all built from peptides and modified by halogenation and glycosylation, except complestatin that was a heptapeptide without glycosylation. in addition, halogenation occurred on the benzene rings derived from amino acids of the above peptide-like macrocyclic compounds. taken together, hal <dig> was expected to function in a similar way in the biosynthesis of peptide-like macrocyclic compounds. since peptide-like macrocyclic natural products are promising in antibacterial activity and other bioactivities, streptomyces sp. 604 f is worthy of further investigation of natural products and the potential gene clusters. however, no halometabolites were detected under the regular conditions using hplc-tof ms  analysis . in addition, qrt-pcr failed to detect the expression of hal <dig> under the same conditions . therefore, the hplc-tof ms and qrt-pcr data suggested that hal <dig> was probably silent under the examined conditions.

genome mining for target gene cluster
the failure in detection of predicted halometabolites and expression of hal <dig> requires further genomic investigation to detect potential halogenase-containing gene cluster in strain 604 f. genome was sequenced using illumina platform. the gap closure and manual correction of the draft genome are still in progress. as expected, a potential gene cluster containing hal <dig> was predicted by using the antismash program. the gene cluster was annotated as in table  <dig>  containing pks, modular nrps genes and genes encoding modification enzymes such as halogenase hal <dig>  the predicted product of the hal604-containing gene cluster was a peptide-derived molecule, corresponding to the prediction based on hal <dig> alone. further investigations of the hal604-containing gene cluster are planned to identify the potential halometabolite and its biosynthesis. as an example, it demonstrated that bioprospecting based on halogenase and genomic data mining is promising to discover strains with halometabolite biosynthesis potential. it is especially powerful to discover hidden products usually missed in traditional chemical isolation, since most encoding gene clusters are silent under normal conditions. in addition, halogenases identified in this study could be used in combinatorial biosynthesis to produce new compounds with halogen modification. this was demonstrated previously in pyrh and thal that halogenate at  <dig> and  <dig> positions of tryptophan respectively. co-expression of pyrh and thal with rebeccamycin biosynthetic genes produced new derivatives with novel halogenation  <cit> .table  <dig> annotation of the potential halogenase-containing biosynthetic gene cluster



CONCLUSIONS
new halogenases with indications of potential halometabolite production were discovered from arctic marine actinomycetes. it showed that halogenase gene-based bioprospecting allowed rapid discovery of microbial strains with potential in halometabolite production. in addition, it could increase the robustness of halometabolite discovery from cryptic or silent gene clusters. furthermore, it suggested that arctic marine actinomycetes were promising targets for discovering new halogenases and halometabolites. it encourages further investigation of halometabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and their products from the almost untapped polar microorganisms.
