BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is a facultative intracellular pathogen responsible for melioidosis, an infectious disease of humans prevalent in southeast asia and northern australia  <cit> . infections in humans may result in a wide range of clinical symptoms and manifestations  <cit>  and in some individuals the bacterium is able to persist with symptoms not shown until several years after exposure  <cit> .

b. pseudomallei has been shown to have a broad host range with disease reported in animals ranging from kangaroos to dolphins  <cit> . however, in the laboratory, the mouse is the most commonly used infection model  <cit> . different strains of b. pseudomallei vary markedly in their virulence in murine models of disease. when given by the intraperitoneal  route, the most virulent isolates have an infectious dose of less than  <dig> colony forming units , whereas in the least virulent isolates the infectious dose is over  <dig>  cfu  <cit> . it is not clear whether these differences in virulence in mice are associated with the various clinical outcomes observed in humans.

whilst murine models of infection are valuable for understanding mechanisms of virulence, the behaviour of b. pseudomallei in cell culture systems has been used to characterise the intracellular lifestyle of the bacterium. b. pseudomallei has been shown to be taken up by professional phagocytes including mouse macrophage-like cell lines such as j <dig> and raw <dig>  <cit>  and non-phagocytic cells including hela and a <dig> cells  <cit> .

more recently, other members of the burkholderia genus including b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis have been described as being closely related to b. pseudomallei  <cit> . indeed, until recently, b. thailandensis isolates were classified as b. pseudomallei  <cit> . there is extensive chromosomal synteny between b. thailandensis and b. pseudomallei, although some virulence-associated genes which are present in b. pseudomallei are absent in b. thailandensis  <cit> . both b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis are able to invade and grow in a range of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, forming plaques or multinucleated giant cells  <cit> . however, there is also evidence that the behaviour of b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis differs in different cell lines. in a <dig> and human dendritic cells, b. pseudomallei has been shown to be more invasive than b. thailandensis, but there were no reported differences in the growth rate within cells. in contrast, in human macrophages, differences in intracellular growth rates have been reported  <cit> . collectively, these findings have suggested that b. thailandensis could be used as a model to study certain aspects of the intracellular lifestyle of b. pseudomallei in cell culture systems  <cit> . the behaviour of b. oklahomensis in cell culture models is not known.

the value of whole animal or plant infection models, which use b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis in place of b. pseudomallei, is much less clear. isolates of b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis that have been tested are considered to be highly attenuated or avirulent in balb/c mice, with lethal doses for most isolates in excess of  <dig> cfu by the i.p. route  <cit> . however, using intranasal challenge models, doses of greater than  <dig> cfu of b. thailandensis are reportedly able to kill mice and replicate b. pseudomallei disease phenotypes, although even in this model it is clear that b. thailandensis is much less virulent than b. pseudomallei  <cit> .

there has been significant interest in the development of alternative infection models which avoid the use of mammals but also reflect the differences in virulence of species and isolates seen in mice. the caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  or tomato plant  <cit>  infection models were not able to distinguish between b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis, and in c. elegans, b. thailandensis was the most virulent  <cit> . galleria mellonella  larvae have previously been reported as susceptible to infection with b. pseudomallei, and a single b. thailandensis strain tested was reportedly less virulent  <cit> . this finding suggests that g. mellonella larvae may be a suitable host species for discerning differences in virulence.

our aim was to determine whether differences in the virulence of b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis isolates could be reliably determined in macrophage and g. mellonella larvae infection models.

RESULTS
b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis are internalised with similar efficiencies into j774a. <dig> macrophages
for this study we have selected a range of b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis isolates of known ancestry. the properties of these isolates and their virulence in murine models of disease is summarised in table  <dig>  the intracellular replication profiles for each isolate were initially determined in a cell culture model using murine macrophages. this was performed using a modified intracellular replication assay where  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin was used to kill extracellular bacteria, as validated below. initially, the minimum inhibitory concentration  of kanamycin for each strain was determined and found to be 16- <dig> μg/ml . all of the strains tested were unable to grow in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin in broth. similarly, supernatants of j774a. <dig> cell cultures containing  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin and infected with any of the strains did not contain viable bacteria when samples were plated onto agar. to test for harmful effects of kanamycin on eukaryotic cell lines, cell toxicity assays  were carried out on culture supernatants from uninfected j774a. <dig> cells that had been cultured in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin. there was no significant difference between the ldh levels of these culture supernatants compared to control supernatants from j774a. <dig> cells cultured in the absence of kanamycin .

description of the burkholderia strains used in this study, their susceptibility to kanamycin as described by the minimum inhibitory concentration  and a summary of published data on virulence of these isolates in mice described as the median lethal dose  in colony forming units or as number of survivors.

the first parameter that was assessed in the macrophage model was internalisation efficiencies of the burkholderia strains. bacteria released from j774a. <dig> macrophages lysed  <dig> hrs post infection were enumerated on agar plates and compared to the input number. there was no significant difference between the degree of internalisation of b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis into murine macrophages .

high virulence isolates of b. pseudomallei grow more rapidly in j774a. <dig> macrophages than low virulence isolates, b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis
next, intracellular replication was measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs post infection. there was a significant difference between the numbers of intracellular b. pseudomallei strains  <dig> and k <dig> at  <dig> hrs post infection  and both were significantly higher than numbers of intracellular b. pseudomallei strain 708a and any of the b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis strains tested . bacterial numbers were over 10-fold lower with any of the b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis strains tested . to test whether the low numbers of intracellular bacteria observed with b. pseudomallei 708a, which is more sensitive to kanamycin, was a consequence of low levels of antibiotic crossing the eukaryotic cell membrane, j774a. <dig> cells were infected with b. thailandensis dw <dig>  and intracellular bacterial numbers were compared to its parental strain e <dig>  the numbers of bacteria isolated at each time point were not significantly different between strains e <dig> and dw <dig> .

our results also showed variance between the patterns of growth in macrophages of different isolates of b. thailandensis. the b. thailandensis strains previously isolated from cases of human disease, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig>  showed increased numbers at  <dig> hrs post infection relative to b. thailandensis e <dig>  and the two b. oklahomensis strains c <dig> and e <dig> , but not b. thailandensis strain phuket . to show that these differences in bacterial numbers were due to differences in intracellular replication and survival rather than a difference in bacterial fitness, growth rates of bacteria in antibiotic free media were compared. there was no significant difference between any of the strains tested .

cellular damage assessed by ldh release correlates with virulence
the ability to cause cellular damage is often used as an indicator of bacterial virulence. cellular damage can be measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase  from dead or dying cells. j774a. <dig> macrophages were challenged with bacteria and ldh levels in supernatants were measured at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs post infection. at  <dig> hrs, ldh levels were relatively low and there was no significant difference in the levels of ldh released from cells infected with any of the bacteria tested . however, at  <dig> hrs, the levels of ldh in the supernatants of cells infected with b. pseudomallei strains  <dig> or k <dig> was higher than the ldh levels in cell supernatants infected with other burkholderia strains . supernatants from cells infected with b. thailandensis strains cdc <dig>  cdc <dig> and phuket contained elevated levels of ldh relative to uninfected controls, but supernatants from cells infected with b. pseudomallei 708a, b. thailandensis e <dig> or either b. oklahomensis strain contained negligible levels of ldh.

b. thailandensis but not b. oklahomensis is able to cause multinucleated giant cell formation
b. pseudomallei has previously been shown to form multinucleated giant cells  upon invasion of macrophages  <cit> . here, b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis strains were tested for their ability to form mngcs after infecting j774a. <dig> macrophages. a cell was considered to be a mngc if there were  <dig> or more nuclei present. b. thailandensis was able to induce mngc formation in a strain dependent manner. b. thailandensis strains cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> were most effective at causing mngc formation . in contrast, b. thailandensis strain e <dig> was poor at causing the formation of mngcs and the b. oklahomensis strains tested did not appear to induce mngc formation beyond uninfected background levels. a representative confocal microscopy image of a mngc formed by b. thailandensis is shown in figure 3b.

b. thailandensis but not b. oklahomensis exhibits actin-based motility in j774a. <dig> macrophages
actin-based motility on infection of eukaryotic cells has previously been demonstrated for b. pseudomallei  <cit>  and b. thailandensis strain e <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether other b. thailandensis strains and b. oklahomensis are also able to migrate using actin-based motility, j774a. <dig> macrophages were infected with strains that expressed red fluorescent protein from plasmid pbhr4-gros-rfp. in preliminary studies, we showed that the presence of the plasmid did not affect the growth of the bacteria in lb broth or inside macrophages, and the plasmid was stably maintained for the course of the intracellular replication assay. at different time points post infection, macrophages were stained with phalloidin conjugated to fitc and analysed by confocal microscopy. both b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis were visualised in the cells. actin tails were visible and associated with b. thailandensis  but were not visible in b. oklahomensis infected cells .

infection of galleria mellonella larvae with burkholderia
galleria mellonella  larvae were challenged with approximately  <dig> cfu of b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis and survival was recorded at  <dig> hrs post-challenge. b. pseudomallei strains  <dig> or k <dig> caused 100% mortality, but no deaths were observed after challenge with b. pseudomallei 708a . challenge with b. oklahomensis strains c <dig> or e <dig> also did not result in death of the larvae at  <dig> hrs post infection. the b. thailandensis strains showed different degrees of virulence in this model. 100% mortality was recorded after challenge with b. thailandensis cdc <dig> or cdc <dig>  challenge with b. thailandensis phuket or e <dig> resulted in mortality of approximately 80% and 50% of larvae, respectively . at  <dig> hrs post challenge, just prior to the onset of paralysis and death, larvae were sacrificed and the number of bacteria in the haemocoel was enumerated. for all of the strains tested, the bacterial numbers at  <dig> hrs post infection were higher than the input number . similar to the cell culture model, b. pseudomallei strains  <dig> and k <dig> and b. thailandensis strains cdc <dig>  cdc <dig> and phuket showed increased bacterial numbers relative to b. pseudomallei 708a, b. thailandensis e <dig> and both b. oklahomensis strains. to show that live bacteria are needed for killing of g. mellonella, b. thailandensis cdc <dig> or cdc <dig> were inactivated by heating to 80°c for  <dig> hour and then injected into g. mellonella larvae at the same concentration as live bacteria. after  <dig> hrs, all larvae infected with heat killed bacteria were still alive, whereas those infected with live bacteria had all died .

at higher challenge doses of  <dig>  cfu bacteria, all of the strains caused 100% mortality of the cohort of larvae at  <dig> hrs post injection, except b. pseudomallei 708a, b. thailandensis dw <dig> and b. oklahomensis e <dig>  at lower inocula of  <dig> cfu bacteria, all of the b. pseudomallei strains were able to kill g. mellonella by  <dig> hrs post challenge, but no dead larvae were recorded up to  <dig> days after challenge with b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis.

discussion
in this study, we set out to identify inexpensive alternative infection models that would reflect the virulence of b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis or b. oklahomensis in mice and the association of these isolates with human disease. we have chosen b. pseudomallei isolates with different degree of virulence in mice, with strain  <dig> representing one of the most virulent isolates tested to date, and 708a one of the least  <cit> . b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis are not normally considered to be human pathogens. however, occasional cases of disease do occur. we have included clinical isolates of b. thailandensis in our study alongside b. thailandensis isolates that have not been associated with disease , as well as clinical isolates of b. oklahomensis.

in general, our results confirm that cell culture or galleria infection models can be used to discriminate b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis isolates and these results parallel those found in mice. with the exception of strain 708a and compared with b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis isolates, the b. pseudomallei isolates we tested grew more rapidly in macrophages, caused a greater degree of cellular damage and caused greater mortality of g. mellonella larvae. the b. oklahomensis isolates we tested were the least virulent in all of these models. our finding that we are able to distinguish between b. pseudomallei and b. thailandensis isolates on the basis of their virulence in g. mellonella indicates that this model has a greater utility for the identification of virulence factors than the c. elegans  <cit>  or tomato plant  <cit>  infection models.

there were some important differences in the relative virulence of isolates within each species in our models which are not reflected in mouse virulence data. in our macrophage and g. mellonella models, b. pseudomallei 708a was highly attenuated, to a level similar to that of the least virulent b. thailandensis isolates and both of the b. oklahomensis isolates. however, b. pseudomallei 708a is reported to be significantly more virulent than any b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis isolates in mice  <cit> . b. pseudomallei 708a is a naturally occurring gentamicin sensitive isolate that, when compared to b. pseudomallei k <dig>  contains a 131-kb deletion within chromosome i  <cit> . this deletion removes the amrab-opra operon providing aminoglycoside resistance, which explains the low mic of kanamycin for this strain . the deletion also results in loss of genes coding for the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway, clusters encoding cobalamin and malleobactin iron uptake systems, and a putative type- <dig> fimbrial gene cluster  <cit> . transcriptome data obtained from b. pseudomallei k <dig> at day three after intranasal infection of balb/c mice showed that genes involved in iron acquisition, including the malleobactin operon, were induced in vivo compared to bacteria grown in vitro in lb broth . the same genes are also upregulated under low iron conditions  <cit> , which suggests that b. pseudomallei encounters iron limited conditions in the mouse model of infection. the absence of these siderophore systems in strain 708a might also partly explain the observed intracellular replication defect in macrophages . overall, and bearing in mind the genome plasticity of b. pseudomallei  <cit> , we cannot be certain that the b. pseudomallei 708a isolate we have used in our study was genetically similar to the isolate previously tested in mice. it would therefore be valuable to re-test the b. pseudomallei 708a isolate we have used for virulence in mice.

we also identified differences in the virulence of b. thailandensis isolates, which were consistent between our macrophage growth, macrophage killing and g. mellonella models, but not with previously reported data on virulence in mice or hamsters. in our models, cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> were the most virulent isolates, whereas cdc <dig>  e <dig> and phuket were most virulent in mouse and hamster infection models  <cit> . a recent study revealed that both cdc strains belong to the same sequence type and are part of a distinct phylogenetic subgroup of b. thailandensis isolates that is separate from strains isolated in thailand  <cit> . moreover, a strain belonging to the same subgroup as the cdc strains was shown to have an increased ability to replicate in macrophages compared to strain e <dig>  in agreement with our data presented in figure 1c. the same study  <cit>  revealed that cdc <dig> encodes a gene cluster with 94% nucleotide similarity to the capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis cluster of b. pseudomallei, which has been shown to play a role in virulence in mice and in hamsters  <cit> . however, our observation that strain cdc <dig>  which does not express the bp-like capsular polysaccharide, is as virulent as strain cdc <dig> in the g. mellonella model suggests that the capsular polysaccharide cluster is not required for virulence in insects. overall, our results show that human clinical isolates of b. thailandensis are more virulent in macrophage and g. mellonella models, and the proposal that clinical b. thailandensis isolates from the usa are less virulent than se asian isolates  <cit>  is not borne out by our data. at this time it is not clear whether murine, hamster, macrophage or g. mellonella models reflect virulence of these isolates in humans.

our finding that the b. oklahomensis isolates have low virulence in macrophage or g. mellonella models is consistent with the report that these isolates exhibit low virulence in murine or hamster models  <cit> . our work also identifies some possible reasons for this. although we were able to visualise rfp-labelled b. oklahomensis cells in macrophages, we did not observe actin tail formation, suggesting that the bacteria would not be able to spread from cell to cell in the same way as b. thailandensis or b. pseudomallei  <cit> . mngcs also failed to form in cells infected with b. oklahomensis, though this may simply reflect the inability of the bacteria to grow in j774a. <dig> macrophages. actin-based motility in b. pseudomallei is dependent on bima, which nucleates actin polymerisation  <cit> . our analysis of the b. oklahomensis shotgun genome sequences  indicated the presence of a bima-like protein with 46% overall identity to its orthologue in b. thailandensis e <dig> , and 40% identity to the b. pseudomallei k <dig> protein . the last  <dig> amino acids of the bima orthologues were found to be highly conserved between all species, whereas the n-terminus exhibited considerable variation. the b. oklahomensis bima proteins contain b. mallei-like signal peptide and proline-rich domains and a b. thailandensis-like central acid domain, but seem to lack a wasp homology domain- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it is not clear if b. oklahomensis bima is functional in promoting actin polymerisation. intracellular replication and endosomal escape of b. pseudomallei depends on the type iii secretion system ttss- <dig>  <cit> , which is also present in b. thailandensis  <cit> . our analysis of the b. oklahomensis genomes revealed the presence of a ttss <dig> gene cluster, with homologies of the encoded proteins ranging from 45% to 98% compared to the b. pseudomallei k <dig> orthologues. however, two genes, bpss <dig>  and bpss <dig> , which have recently been identified as toxr and toxs-like regulators encoded directly downstream of the ttss in b. pseudomallei  <cit> , are also found in b. thailandensis but are absent in the b. oklahomensis strains. bprp activates the expression of ttss genes, and a bprp mutant in b. pseudomallei does not secrete ttss effector proteins and is unable to kill macrophages  <cit> . the absence of this activator in b. oklahomensis might therefore explain the low virulence of this species.

in this study we have not tested burkholderia mallei, another species closely related to b. pseudomallei, for virulence in cell culture or galleria models. it is known that b. mallei is able to infect and grow in macrophages  <cit>  and to kill g. mellonella larvae  <cit> . however, the pathogenesis of b. mallei infection in g. mellonella may be quite different from the pathogenesis of b. thailandensis or b. pseudomallei infection we report here. whereas we recorded larval death by  <dig> hrs post challenge with typical b. pseudomallei isolates, larval deaths occurred over the period  <dig> -  <dig> hrs post challenge with b. mallei  <cit> . this might be explained by the restricted host range of the obligate intracellular bacterium b. mallei compared to b. pseudomallei with its much more versatile genome  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that murine macrophage cell culture or galleria infection models can be used to discriminate b. pseudomallei, b. thailandensis and b. oklahomensis isolates on the basis of their virulence. in general, our results support the proposal that the virulence of isolates in these models reflects virulence in murine models of disease. however, some important exceptions merit further investigation which is not within the scope of this study. our finding that virulence of three b. pseudomallei isolates with high, intermediate and low virulence in mice is reflected in their virulence in cell culture or galleria infection models indicates the potential value of these models for the identification of virulence-associated genes. our findings support the proposal that b. oklahomensis isolates are of low virulence and indicate that these isolates are defective in growth in macrophages and in actin-based motility within cells.
