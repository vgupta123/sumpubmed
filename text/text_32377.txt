BACKGROUND
the mammalian target of rapamycin  is a serine-threonine kinase and a member of the phosphoinositide kinase related-kinase family , which is evolutionary conserved from yeast to humans. mtor acts as a sensor kinase that coordinates cellular response to growth factors, nutrients and energy availability in mammalian cells  <cit> . natural product rapamycin, in complex with immunophilin fkbp <dig>  binds the fkbp12-rapamycin binding  domain of mtor and inhibits phosphorylation of downstream substrates 4e-bp <dig> and s6k <dig>  <cit> . one of the established roles of mtor within the "rapamycin-sensitive" mtorc <dig> complex is to enhance translation rates though the direct phosphorylation of s6k <dig> and 4e-bp <dig> in response to mitogen and nutrient stimulation. another, functionally distinct "rapamycin-insensitive" mtorc <dig> complex phosphorylates akt and regulates cytoskeletal organization in yet understood fashion.  <cit> . to date, it is clear that mtor signaling controls cell cycle progression, cell growth and proliferation by fine-tuning multiple metabolic circuits at the cell autonomous or organismal level. in many human cancers, deregulation of mtor signaling, which is caused by the loss of critical tumor suppressors , somatic mutations or gene amplifications of pi3ca  or activating mutations in akt, ultimately leads to increased cell growth, cell survival, and suppression of autophagy  <cit> .

previous studies of the in vivo functions of mtor in adult metazoans were hampered by the early embryonic lethality or developmental arrest of tor loss-of-function mutants.  <cit> . on the other hand, blocking mtor with rapamycin, an agent that exhibits potent immunosuppressive efficacy in animal models and in clinics, provided important clues for the current understanding of mtor function in immune responses. for example, rapamycin suppresses t cell proliferation in part through its inhibitory effects on cytokine production, cytokine signaling, and on t cell receptor/cd <dig> mediated lymphocyte activation  <cit> . the above effects are linked to the integral role of mtor in control of g1- to s- phase of cell cycle. while the exact molecular mechanisms by which mtor controls t cell division remain unknown, mtor is responsible for activation of cdk <dig> and cdc <dig> kinases, downregulation of p27kip <dig> and the induction of d-cyclins  <cit> . more recent study has demonstrated a direct physical association between mtor, aurora b, s6k and 4e-bp <dig> that determines g1-s checkpoint in t cells  <cit> . specifically, aurora b and mtor cross-regulate each other: rapamycin reduces aurora b kinase activity and aurora b – mediated events, such as rb phosphorylation, induction of cyclin a and activation of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> in primed t cells, whereas expression of aurora b enhances phosphorylation of s6k <dig> and 4e-bp <dig>  <cit> . another report described a novel action of mtor as a regulator of t cell migration during immune activation, where mtor uniquely restricts the expression of l-selectin cd62l, chemokine receptor ccr <dig> and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor type  <dig> , presumably through the downregulation of the transcription factor klf <dig> in activated t cells  <cit> . in addition to t cells, rapamycin can also interfere with b cell activation, proliferation and development, as well as with the function of mast cells  <cit> .

although mtor is a downstream player of pi3k-akt signaling pathway in numerous cell types, it can also respond to pi3k-independent signals, such as levels of amino acids or energy status. indeed, cooperation between mtor and pi3k signaling is important for proper regulation of lymphocyte size, metabolic activity, and cell cycle progression. rapamycin and ly <dig>  a pi3k inhibitor, can target parallel pathways; combining ly <dig> and rapamycin in human peripheral blood lymphocytes  stimulated by tcr or in human kit <dig> cells induced by il- <dig> leads to a synergystic suppression of proliferation. this correlates with differential effect of each drug on cyclin d <dig> and cyclin d <dig> expression  <cit> . another example of where mtor kinase can be stimulated in a pi3k-independent fashion is transformed b cell lines, in which induction of mtor signaling, but not of pi3k or mek, is sensitive to the withdrawal of nutrients  <cit> .

blocking mtor signaling with rapamycin is largely explained by the inhibitory effect of the drug on mtorc <dig> complex. in this context, rapamycin acts as an allosteric mtor inhibitor that does not bind the atp binding pocket of mtor kinase. however, the exact mechanism of how rapamycin inhibits mtor signaling is not fully understood. one of the possibilities is that it blocks kinase-independent functions of mtor by disrupting interactions between mtor and its binding partners. indeed, rapamycin is known to dissociate raptor-mtor interactions resulting in attenuated recognition of substrates by mtor  <cit>  or to abolish phosphatidic acid binding to mtor  <cit> . additional, kinase-independent mechanism of rapamycin action is known in yeast, where rapamycin activates protein phosphotase 2a  <cit> . this and the emergence of mtorc <dig>  a complex that is insensitive to acute rapamycin treatment, suggests a presence of previously unrecognized, mtor kinase-dependent biological responses that are not blocked by rapamycin.

to understand the functional relevance of mtor enzymatic activity in mouse development and in immune responses in vivo, we generated kinase-dead knock-in mutant mice. this strategy allowed us to avoid "secondary" effects that could be caused by conventional gene disruption and to ensure appropriate relative stoichiometry between mtor and other components of mtorc <dig> and mtorc <dig> complexes. our results reveal a critical role for mtor kinase catalytic activity for the early embryonic development. because of the lethality of homozygous mtor knock-in embryos, we analyzed the lymphocyte development, proliferative responses and lymphocyte sensitivity to rapamycin in vitro in heterozygous animals.

RESULTS
generation of mtor d2338a knock-in mice
to understand the in vivo role of the mtor kinase catalytic activity, we set out to generate knock-in mice with a targeted replacement of the wild type mtor allele with a mutant version in which asp  <dig> was changed to ala  . this d2338a substitution  is well known to eliminate phosphotransferase activity in vitro and suppress mtor signaling in cell cultures or in vivo  <cit> . correctly targeted es clones harboring a mutant mtor allele with pgk-neo cassette were identified by southern blotting with an appropriate probe . genotyping of the heterozygous mtor kinase-dead  mice was achieved by pcr analysis of genomic dna. as expected, approximately 332-bp and 405-bp fragments were obtained from the wild-type and kinase-dead mutant alleles, respectively . presence of d2338a mutation in the offspring mice was further confirmed by conventional sequencing of the amplified fragments or by pyrosequencing .

embryonic lethality of mtor homozygous kinase-dead knock-in mice
intercrossing of heterozygous animals followed by pcr genotyping of the offspring revealed that no homozygous pups can be recovered at birth. wild-type and heterozygous mice however, were born at the expected 1: <dig> ratio , indicating that mtor kinase-dead mutation is recessive embryonic lethal. next, to determine the time of embryonic lethality, embryos were collected at different stages of gestation. strikingly, no homozygous mtor kd/kd embryos were detected at embryonic day  <dig>  ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig>  . these findings demonstrate that mtor kinase-dead embryos die within e <dig>  stage and are consistent with a role of mtor in early embryonic development.

genotyping of embryos was performed by pcr as in fig. 2b. number of embryos with corresponding genotypes is shown.

general phenotype of mice heterozygous for the mtor knock-in allele
heterozygous mtor kinase-dead mice were fertile and healthy. it was previously reported that heterozygous pi3k/p110α kinase-dead knock-in mice and s6k <dig> knock-out mice exhibit reduction in body weight  <cit> . therefore, we compared body weights among mtor+/+ and mtor+/kd mice during postnatal growth. there was no significant difference in body weights or pattern of growth, organ size, gross appearance or behavior observed between wild type and heterozygous mice at least up to  <dig> months of age . although heterozygous male mice were slightly smaller during weeks 4– <dig>  the average body weights were not statistically different from those of wild type males .

mtor mrna and protein expression in mtor heterozygous kinase-dead knock-in mice
rt-pcr was used to determine the transcript levels of mtor in heterozygous mtor kinase-dead vs. wild-type mice. mtor mrna expression was analyzed in the heart tissues from two pairs of mtor+/+ and mtor+/kd animals using two different primer sets. similar levels of mtor mrna were detected in both wild-type and heterozygous kinase-dead mice , indicating that the presence of point mutation and of the remaining loxp site in the downstream intron does not affect mtor mrna expression in the heterozygous mice. we also compared mtor protein expression in the heart tissues of mtor+/+ and mtor+/kd mice by westtern immunoblot. quantification of mtor protein expression levels from two pairs of mtor+/+ and mtor+/kd mice did not reveal any significant difference between two genotypes . these results indicate that mtor heterozygous kinase-dead animals express full-length mtor protein at normal levels and are consistent with our rt-pcr data.

immunological phenotype of mtor kinase-dead heterozygous mice
given the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on t- and b-cell mediated immune responses, we analyzed relative distribution of immune cell subsets in thymus, spleen, and bone marrow of mtor+/+ and mtor+/kd littermates. flow cytometric analysis revealed no differences between mtor+/+ and mtor+/kd mice in the percentages of double negative, double positive and single positive cd <dig> and cd <dig> expressing cells in the thymus . in the periphery, the proportions of splenic cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells were also comparable. moreover, we did not observe significant changes in the number of t cells detected with cd <dig> antibody in thymi and spleens of mtor+/kd mice . collectively, these findings indicate that t cell maturation in thymus or periphery is not perturbed in mtor+/kd mice. we also investigated b cell development in mtor heterozygous mutant mice. the levels of more mature igm+ b220+ and igm+ cd19+ b cells in the bone marrow were comparable in mtor+/+ and tor+/kd littermates . however, the bone marrow of mtor+/kd mice had slightly reduced fraction of igm- b220+ and igm- cd19+ b cells. finally, our analysis revealed no difference in the proportions of b-lymphocyte populations in the spleens of wild-type and mtor+/kd mice . these results show that presence of a single functional mtor allele is sufficient to support the t- and b-cell development in mice.

mature t cell proliferation
previous reports have demonstrated that rapamycin suppresses il-2- and tcr/cd28-driven cell proliferation and g1- to s-phase progression of t-cells. furthermore, lowering tor levels with sirna or genetically is known to cause hypersensitivity to rapamycin in model organisms and in vitro  <cit> . specifically, growth of drosophila larvae that are heterozygous for dtor was more profoundly delayed in the presence of rapamycin compared to the wild-type controls  <cit> . therefore, we first investigated proliferative responses of lymphocytes from mtor+/kd mice to various t cell stimuli. proliferation of splenic t cells in response to il- <dig> stimulation, anti-cd <dig> stimulation alone or anti-cd <dig> antibody in combination with il- <dig> or with anti-cd <dig> was not impaired in mtor+/kd compared to wild-type mice . as expected, treatment with  <dig> nm rapamycin potently inhibited il-2-driven proliferation of wild-type splenocytes . similar sensitivity to rapamycin was also observed for the lymphocytes from mtor+/kd mice. next, inhibitory effects of rapamycin on anti-cd3-induced proliferation of wild-type and heterozygous cells were compared using purified t cells grown in the presence or absence of different concentrations of the drug. the proliferative response of t cells to anti-cd <dig> stimulation was equally well inhibited by rapamycin with ic <dig> values of ~ <dig> nm for cells of both genotypes . these results indicate that t cell proliferation is normal in mtor+/kd mouse and that a heterozygousity for a kinase-dead mtor does not sensitize t cells to rapamycin in vitro.

mtor kinase activity is normal in mtor+/kd mice
because only one catalytically active mtor allele is present in all tissues from the kinase-dead heterozygous animals, we expected to observe nearly 50% loss in total mtor kinase activity. immunoprecipitation of the mtor from heart and liver lysates of mtor+/kd mice showed no change in kinase activity, as measured by phosphorylation of exogenously added 4e-bp <dig> and by auto-phoshorylation of the mtor itself . this finding suggests that there may be a compensatory up-regulation of mtor activity in mtor+/kd mice, as the total expression of mtor remains unchanged .

discussion
current understanding of the in vivo role of mtor in the immune responses stems from the use of pharmacological inhibitors of the pi3-kinase signaling and nutrient-sensing mtor pathway. the mtor signaling inhibitor rapamycin is a widely used immunosuppressive drug that interferes with the lymphocyte function at multiple levels. it acts in part, by inhibiting t- and b-cell proliferation, t lymphocyte migration, or by promoting treg cell differentiation  <cit> . cancer biology has generated significant body of evidence indicating that rapamycin's effects on mtor kinase activity are incomplete or are at times even different from the direct inactivation of kinase activity by mutations  <cit> . furthermore, the deletion of mtor gene in mice results in more pronounced phenotypes than those induced by rapamycin  <cit> . to avoid "secondary" effects caused by gene disruption we attempted to generate mtor kinase-dead knock-in mice that will reflect the action of small molecule inhibitors more accurately. unexpectedly, we found that a single site mutation in the mtor kinase domain, a replacement of aspartic acid at position  <dig> with alanine is essential for the early development of homozygous mouse embryos. as demonstrated in multiple studies, d2338a change renders mtor kinase catalytically inactive, suggesting that observed embryonic lethality is a direct consequence of the loss of the mtor kinase activity in vivo.

similar to our report, early embryonic lethality was described for mtor null mice with complete or partial  disruption of the mtor gene  <cit> . lethality of homozygous mtor null embryos in these studies was linked to the defect in inner cell mass  and trophoblast proliferation of the blastocysts. although we have not determined the exact reason and the timing of embryonic lethality in mtor kd/kd mice, the fact that no homozygous embryos can be recovered at e <dig>  in our study agrees well with developmental arrest of homozygous mtor null embryos at e <dig>   <cit> . the reason why mtor kd/kd mutant embryos cannot be detected at the same stage when homozygous mtor null embryos are still present , could be explained by the possible contamination of the mtor kd/kd embryos with maternal tissue during the dissection procedure. another example underscoring the role of mtor in embryonic development is the ethylnitrosourea-induced "flat-top" mutation in the intron of mtor  <cit> . the homozygous flat-top mouse mutant embryos obtained during the above study, however, survive to the much later stage  than mtor kd/kd mice, presumably due to the residual expression of the wild-type mtor protein sufficient to support the embryonic development at earlier stages. in addition, profound defects in forebrain development in both flat-top embryos and rapamycin-induced phenocopy  <cit>  were not observed in mtor+/kd mice in our study.

mtor+/kd knock-in mice showed no gross morphological or behavioral changes. this result is consistent with the phenotypes of homozygous mtor null mice, showing no obvious anatomical defects. furthermore, mtor+/kd pups exhibited normal body weights, which is also in agreement with unaltered body sizes of heterozygous mtor null mice. the ability of mtor+/kd knock-in mice to progress through embryonic development and postnatal growth without obvious abnormalities suggests that a single remaining wild-type mtor allele is sufficient to support normal mouse development. interestingly, this is in contrast to the phenotypes of mice heterozygous for the kinase-dead knock-in mutation in pi3k p110α, which show growth retardation linked to the decrease in skeletal muscle mass  <cit> .

generation of the mtor kinase-dead knock-in mice ensured appropriate relative stoichiometry between mtor and other components of mtorc <dig> and mtorc <dig> complexes. for example, complete elimination of mtor expression in homozygous mtor null mice leads to more severe phenotype compared to the partial reduction in the functional mtor protein in the flat-top mutants. because mtor+/kd mice contain one copy of wild-type allele and one copy of kinase-dead d2338a allele, they are expected to express normal levels of mtor mrna or a "full-length" mtor protein. while we were not able to distinguish the product of the mutant allele from the wild type mtor, our knock-in procedure did not interfere with either mtor mrna level or the total amount of mtor protein in tissues from mtor+/kd mice. thus, an indispensable role of mtor in early embryogenesis is likely due to the loss of its catalytic activity, rather than a disruption of mtor containing protein complexes or a scaffolding function of the mtor, both of which cannot be ruled out from the studies involving mtor null or flat-top mutants. given the established effects of rapamycin in t and b cell development, we examined the role of mtor in the immune system in mice heterozygous for the kinase-dead mutation of mtor. surprisingly, facs analysis of lymphoid compartments did not reveal any significant changes in t cell development in thymus or in generation and maintenance of mature t cells in the periphery of mtor+/kd mice. while we have observed somewhat decreased frequency of igm-b220+ and igm-cd19+ subsets in the bone marrow, the precise stage of b cell development at which this reduction occurs awaits further investigation. furthermore, the frequency of the more mature b cell subsets in the bone marrow and spleen was comparable between +/kd mice and their wild type littermates, suggesting that the development and maintenance of mature b cells were largely unperturbed in mtor+/kd mice. multiple studies utilizing rapamycin have also demonstrated a critical role for mtor in the response of t cells to tcr/cd <dig> initiated stimuli or il- <dig> driven cell expansion. in the present report, however, we found that il- <dig> or cd3-mediated proliferative responses of t cells were not compromised in mtor+/kd mice.

reduction of tor gene dosage in other organisms is known to cause hypersensitivity to rapamycin. for example, heterozygous drosophila dtor larvae are much more sensitive to rapamycin than wild type controls  <cit> . combination of mtor sirna and rapamycin had also synergistic effect at inhibiting growth of several human cancer cell lines  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that proliferation of t cells isolated from mtor+/kd animals could be more sensitive to the effects of the drug. our finding that wild type t cell proliferation in response to anti-cd <dig> was inhibited by rapamycin in a dose-dependent manner with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . notably, proliferation of t cells of both genotypes was similarly inhibited by the drug at all doses when stimulated with cd <dig> anitbody or by  <dig> nm rapamycin when il- <dig> was present in the medium. in addition to comparable proliferative responses between +/kd and wild type t cells, we found no significant alterations in the cell cycle profile of +/kd thymocytes . thus, our data suggest that eliminating one functional allele of mtor does no affect immune system function in mice.

there are two possible explanations of why mtor+/kd mice did not show significant phenotypes compared to with wild type littermates. first, is that expected 50% reduction in total mtor kinase activity is not sufficient to disrupt mtor-related functions in mtor+/kd mice. second, it is possible that there could be a compensatory increase in catalytic activity of the protein generated from the wild type allele to account for the loss of kinase activity by the kinase-dead protein. our data show that mtor+/kd mice exhibit normal overall mtor kinase activity in at least heart and liver tissues. while more accurate measurements of the total mtor kinase activity and phosphorylation of the downstream mtor effectors 4e-bp <dig> and s6k <dig> may be necessary, we think that compensatory upregulation of the mtor kinase activity in a heterozygous setting is a possibility in at least some tissues. although no previous knock-out studies addressed a role for the mtor in the immune system function, mice heterozygous for mtor did not exhibit any obvious alterations in morphology or growth, which is consistent with our findings. interestingly, drosphila larvae heterozygous for dtor also grow at a similar rate as wild type controls  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, generation of mtor kinase-dead knock-in mice demonstrated a critical role for mtor catalytic activity in normal embryonic development. since mtor+/kd mice are indistinguishable from wild type in phenotypes, further studies involving conditional tissue-specific inactivation of mtor will be necessary to clarify the role of mtor in immune system and in diseases such as cancer.
