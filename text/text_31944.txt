BACKGROUND
the early region 1a  of adenoviruses encodes two main proteins  which are translated from alternatively spliced mrnas . the two proteins have identical n- and c-terminal regions but the larger one  has an additional domain  located in the central part of the protein. four regions that are conserved between several human adenoviruses were named cr <dig>  cr <dig>  cr <dig> and cr <dig>  in adenovirus  <dig>  cr <dig> almost coincides with the  <dig> aa-long additional domain present in the e1a-13s isoform. the e1a-12s and e1a-13s proteins are required to activate the transcription of other viral genes. in addition, these proteins interact with multiple cellular proteins to reprogram the expression of many cellular genes in infected cells . this is necessary for the virus to replicate its dna and complete a productive cycle. the e1a proteins were also found to be oncogenic in primary rodent cells. this is a consequence of their ability to interact with key cellular factors, including regulators of the cell cycle such as the pocket proteins , the related p <dig> and cbp coactivators of transcription or the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21cip1/waf <dig> and p27kip <dig>  among the other cellular factors known to interact with e1a are the trrap, p <dig> and ctbp <dig> proteins. ctbp <dig> is a transcriptional corepressor. several transcriptional repressors recruit ctbp <dig> to promoters through a conserved pxdls motif. ctbp <dig> represses transcription either directly or by subsequent recruitment of histone deacetylases   <cit> . e1a proteins interact with ctbp <dig> by a pldls motif located at the c-terminus of the viral proteins  <cit> . a pldls motif is also present in the binding site of the cellular ctip protein, another interacting partner of ctbp <dig>  <cit> . the function of ctip in the cell is unknown but it was found to interact with the brct repeats of the brca <dig> tumor suppressor protein  <cit> . ctip binds to brca <dig> through a site distinct from the pldls motif  <cit> . thus, ctip can act as an adapter protein between brca <dig> and ctbp <dig> 

we are interested in the mechanisms involved in transcriptional deregulation of gene expression in the cells of the sw613-s cell line derived from a human colon carcinoma  <cit> . analysis of cellular clones isolated from this cell line indicated that it is heterogeneous and composed of a mixture of two main cell types . t-type cells have a high level of amplification and expression of the c-myc gene, whose additional copies are located on extrachromosomal elements . nt-type cells present a low level of amplification of the oncogene and the supernumerary copies are integrated into chromosomal dna  <cit> . t and nt cells markedly differ by several phenotypic traits such as their tumorigenic potential in nude mice, capability to grow in serum-free medium, sensitivity to the induction of apoptosis and cellular morphology  <cit> . genes overexpressed in t cells, as compared to nt cells, have been identified  <cit> . among them, we chose the keratin  <dig>  gene to investigate the mechanism responsible for its overexpression in t-type cells. we previously reported that this high level of expression is mainly due to an increase in transcriptional rate  <cit>  and that, in transient expression assays, the k <dig> promoter is much more active in t cells than in nt cells  <cit> . the mechanism responsible for this higher activity is acting on the minimal k <dig> promoter  and does not involve the binding of a factor to a specific site on the dna  <cit> . we also found that an acetylation mechanism acting on a non-histone substrate is driving the high activity of the promoter in t cells  <cit> . in order to get further insight into this mechanism, we now investigated the effect of the adenovirus e1a protein on the activity of the k <dig> promoter, both in t and nt cells. this protein has been widely used as a powerful tool to identify and/or study important cellular regulatory proteins, in particular factors involved in acetylation mechanisms   <cit> . using a series of e1a mutant proteins, we uncovered a role for the ctbp <dig> and brca <dig> proteins in the functioning of the k <dig> promoter in sw613-s cells.

RESULTS
wild type e1a and e1a mutants differentially inhibit or stimulate the minimal k <dig> promoter
we previously found that the adenoviral e1a-12s protein has an inhibitory effect on the k <dig> promoter, specifically in t-type cells of the sw613-s cell line. in contrast, a mutant form of the protein, lacking the cr <dig> domain , has lost this inhibitory effect but gained a stimulatory activity on the k <dig> promoter, specifically in nt cells  <cit> . all the e1a mutants that we planned to use in this work were derived from the e1a-13s isoform. therefore, the effect of the e1a-13s protein and of the e1a-d30- <dig> mutant protein  on the activity of the k <dig> promoter  was assayed. as shown in figure 1a, the e1a-13s protein has also a strong inhibitory effect on the promoter activity in t cells whereas it has no significant effect in nt cells. in contrast, the e1a-d30- <dig> mutant behaves like the e1a-12s-Δcr <dig> protein and stimulates the activity of the promoter, specifically in nt cells.

the promoter of the k <dig> gene comprises a tata box and an initiation site  flanked by an sp <dig> binding site . the minimal k <dig> promoter  has a low but differential activity between t and nt cells. the flanking sp <dig> binding site is essential for a high activity of the promoter but not for its differential behavior  <cit> . the effect of the e1a-13s protein and of the e1a-d30- <dig> mutant was also assayed on the minimal k <dig> promoter . the former inhibits the activity of the minimal promoter, specifically in t cells, and the latter stimulates it only in nt cells, indicating that the sp <dig> binding site is not essential for these effects. by mutational analysis of the k <dig> minimal promoter, we have previously shown that the factor responsible for its differential activity between t and nt cells does not bind to a specific dna sequence  <cit> . using the same mutant constructs of the k <dig> promoter , we investigated whether the inhibitory or stimulatory effects of the e1a-13s and e1a-d30- <dig> proteins were also sequence-independent. as shown in figure 2a–d, all the promoter constructs are inhibited by e1a-13s, specifically in t cells, and are stimulated by the e1a-d30- <dig> mutant, only in nt cells. these results suggest that, as for the differential activity of the promoter, the effect of these viral proteins is not mediated by a factor which binds to a specific site on the promoter but rather through alterations of protein-protein interactions within the preinitiation complex.

an n-terminal domain of e1a is involved in the inhibitory effect on the k <dig> promoter
in order to identify the region of the e1a protein involved in the inhibition of the k <dig> promoter in t-type cells, we first used a series of n- or c-terminal deletion mutants . all the c-terminal deletion mutants have a comparable inhibitory effect on the activity of the k <dig> promoter in t-type cells . mutant e1a-c <dig>  which comprises only the n-terminal  <dig> aa, seems less efficient at inhibiting the promoter. further careful comparative analysis indicated that the inhibitory potency of this mutant is about 60% of that of the e1a-13s protein . some of the mutants also acquired an inhibitory potential in nt cells but this point was not explored further. none of the c-terminal deletion mutants display a stimulatory effect on the promoter in nt cells. the localization of the inhibitory domain in the first  <dig> aa of e1a was confirmed by the analysis of n-terminal deletion mutants . mutant e1a-n <dig>  deleted of the first  <dig> amino acids, has lost the inhibitory potential in t cells but has acquired the ability to stimulate the promoter in nt cells. this was also the case for all the other n-terminal deletion mutants. the expression level of the constructs coding for the e1a deletion mutants was checked by western blotting .

the results obtained with the n- and c-terminal deletion mutants, assigning a role to the first  <dig> aa in the inhibitory effect of e1a on the k <dig> promoter, were apparently contradictory to those obtained with deletion mutants e1a-12s-Δcr <dig> and e1a-d30- <dig> . to solve this issue, a series of small deletion mutants was constructed, spanning the region of aa  <dig> to  <dig> . with the exception of mutant e1a-d12- <dig>  which has lost the inhibitory potential in t cells , all the other deletions in this region of the protein have no influence on the inhibitory effect of e1a and are unable to confer a stimulatory potential . in particular, mutants e1a-d26- <dig>  -d30- <dig>  -d40- <dig> and -d60- <dig>  whose deletions span the region deleted in mutant e1a-12s-Δcr <dig> and e1a-d30- <dig>  have the same properties as wild type e1a with respect to the k <dig> promoter. the expression level of the e1a constructs used in the above-described experiments was checked by western blotting . from all these results, we concluded that region 12– <dig> of e1a is involved in its inhibitory effect on the k <dig> promoter in t-type cells. the large deletion carried by mutants e1a-d30- <dig> and e1a-12s-Δcr <dig> is adjacent to the 12– <dig> domain. a possible explanation for the results obtained with these mutants is that such large deletions may perturb the conformational structure of the molecule and functionally inactivates the 12– <dig> domain. it has been reported  <cit>  that e1a mutants with deletions between residues 30– <dig> may not enter the nucleus, despite the presence of an unaltered nuclear localization signal at their c-terminus.

a c-terminal domain of e1a is involved in the stimulatory effect on the k <dig> promoter
as mentioned above, all the n-terminal deletion mutants tested possess an activator effect on the k <dig> promoter, specifically in nt cells . mutant e1a-n <dig> comprises only the last  <dig> aa of e1a-13s. on the other hand, none of the c-terminal mutants tested has acquired a stimulatory activity on the promoter in nt cells . from these results, we concluded that the region of e1a responsible for the stimulatory effect is located in the c-terminal part of the protein. the ctbp <dig> protein is known to interact with the pldls motif present in this c-terminal region of e1a  <cit> . to investigate a role for ctbp <dig> in the stimulatory effect of this region on the k <dig> promoter in nt cells, we used a previously characterized mutant of the pldls domain  <cit> . a two aa change  destroys the capacity of binding to ctbp <dig> but does not affect the nuclear localization signal which is located nearby. we constructed the e1a-n190-mut281- <dig> mutant which is mutated on aa  <dig>  and  <dig> . the binding of ctbp <dig> to e1a-n <dig> and the loss of interaction with e1a-n190-mut281- <dig> were confirmed by gst pull down assays and western blotting . in transient expression assays , the e1a-n190-mut281- <dig> mutant cannot stimulate the k <dig> promoter in the nt cells. this result indicates that the binding to ctbp <dig> plays a role in the stimulatory effect of the c-terminal region of e1a on the activity of the k <dig> promoter in nt cells. this was confirmed by the observation that an excess of ctbp <dig> protein can abolish the stimulatory effect of e1a-n <dig> on the k <dig> promoter in nt cells , although ctbp <dig> by itself has no effect on the activity of the promoter . the expression level of the e1a-n <dig> and ctbp <dig> vectors was controlled by western blot analysis . a likely explanation for these results is that, in nt cells, the k <dig> promoter is repressed by a mechanism involving the binding of ctbp <dig> to the pldls motif of a partner protein. stimulatory mutants such as e1a-n <dig> disrupt this interaction and relieve the repressed state of the promoter.

the differential activity of the k <dig> promoter and the inhibitory or stimulatory effect of various e1a mutant proteins are mediated by the minimal promoter . no specific sequence of the promoter seems necessary for these effects  which likely result from alterations in protein interactions in the preinitiation complex. it was reported that the ctbp <dig> protein is a corepressor which is recruited to promoters by dna-bound transcription factors  <cit> . therefore, our observations raise the question of how this protein is recruited to the preinitiation complex on the minimal k <dig> promoter. ctbp <dig> interacts with the carboxy-terminal interacting protein   <cit> , which is a known partner of the rb, lmo <dig> and brca <dig> proteins. a complex comprising lmo <dig>  brca <dig> and ctip was demonstrated in vivo  <cit> . the direct recruitment of the rb protein to the transcription machinery has not been described to date but the presence of the brca <dig> protein in the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme has been reported  <cit> . this observation raises the possibility of a direct association of the brca <dig> protein with the preinitiation complex. the c-terminal brct repeats of brca <dig> are responsible for the interaction of this protein with ctip  <cit> . the nonsense y1853→stop mutation identified in some familial breast cancers results in a 10-aa truncation of the second brct repeat and prevents the interaction of the mutant protein with ctip. the possible effect of the wild type brca <dig> protein, of the brca <dig> mutant and of a c-terminal fragment of the brca <dig> protein comprising only the brct repeats  on the activity of the k <dig> promoter was tested . if the brca <dig> mutant has retained the capacity to be incorporated into the preinitiation complex, it should behave as a dominant negative mutant and stimulate the activity of the promoter, specifically in nt cells, since it is unable to recruit the ctip-ctbp <dig> complex. if the brct fragment has lost the capacity to be incorporated into the preinitiation complex, it should also behave as a dominant negative mutant and stimulate the activity of the promoter, specifically in nt cells, since it should sequester the ctip-ctbp <dig> complex away from the preinitiation complex. wild type brca <dig> has no effect on the activity of the promoter in transient expression assays. the brca <dig> mutant and the brct fragment do have a stimulatory effect on the activity of the k <dig> promoter, specifically in nt cells. the expression level of the brca <dig> constructs used in these experiments was assessed by western blotting . the apparent dominant negative effect of the two brca <dig> mutants indicates that the interaction of brca <dig> with ctip plays an important role in maintaining the repressed state of the k <dig> promoter in nt cells. altogether, our results strongly suggest that the ctip protein acts as an adapter molecule between brca <dig> and ctbp <dig>  allowing the recruitment of ctbp <dig> to the preinitiation complex and the repression of the k <dig> promoter in nt cells.

discussion
differential activity of the k <dig> promoter and opposite effects of e1a mutants
we report here that the e1a protein isoforms  and derivatives of e1a-13s that retain the n-terminal first  <dig> aa inhibit the activity of the k <dig> promoter, specifically in t-type cells of the sw613-s colon carcinoma cell line. in contrast, derivatives of the viral protein which have lost the inhibitory region but retain the c-terminal region of e1a stimulate the activity of the k <dig> promoter, specifically in nt cells. the two phenomena appear to be exclusive: among more than  <dig> e1a mutants studied , none was found that could both repress the activity of the promoter in t cells and stimulate it in nt cells. this observation suggests that the two phenomena are related and could result from interference with the same and single mechanism. this is further supported by the observation that the stimulatory effect of mutant e1a-n <dig> is abolished in the presence of the wild-type e1a protein . we have previously found that the differential activity of the k <dig> promoter between t and nt cells is a property of the minimal promoter )  <cit> . the mechanism responsible for this difference in activity does not involve the binding of a factor to a specific sequence of the promoter  <cit>  but probably results from alterations of protein-protein interactions within the preinitiation complex. the same conclusion was reached here for the stimulatory or inhibitory effects of the various e1a derivatives on the activity of the k <dig> promoter. these effects were observed with the minimal promoter and with all the mutated versions of the k <dig> promoter tested. altogether, these results strongly suggest that both inhibitory and stimulatory mutants of e1a exert their effect by interfering with the very mechanism responsible for the differential activity of the k <dig> promoter.

a functional domain of the e1a protein located in the 12– <dig> region
we have found that a unique region of e1a, located between aa  <dig> and  <dig>  is involved in its inhibitory effect on the activity of the k <dig> promoter. we previously reported results which suggested that e1a is acting on the p <dig> or cbp protein to inhibit the activity of the k <dig> promoter in t-type cells  <cit> . two regions of the e1a protein, the n-terminal 1– <dig> region and the cr <dig> region, are known to be involved in the interaction of the viral protein with p300/cbp  <cit> . within the cr <dig> region, the p300/cbp interacting domain is most probably located between aa  <dig> and  <dig>  in the n-terminal region, two p300/cbp interacting domains have been identified. the first one spans residues 2– <dig> of e1a and the second domain is located between aa 19– <dig>  it was shown  <cit>  that aa 11– <dig> are not essential for the binding of e1a to p300/cbp. thus, the 12– <dig> region involved in the inhibition of the k <dig> promoter appears to be different from the regions of interaction with the p300/cbp proteins. furthermore, we have found that mutants e1a-arg <dig> , e1a-d2- <dig> and e1a-d61- <dig> which can no longer bind to p300/cbp, still efficiently inhibit the activity of the k <dig> promoter in t-type cells. altogether, our results lead us to conclude that, contrary to what we suggested previously, inactivation of the p300/cbp proteins is most probably not involved in this inhibitory effect. it was reported that aa 1– <dig> and 55– <dig> of e1a are involved in its interaction with the pcaf factor  <cit> . the 1– <dig> region has not been further investigated so far to determine precisely the aa residues responsible for binding to pcaf. however, since the e1a-d40- <dig> mutant retains an inhibitory potential on the activity of the k <dig> promoter, this inhibition probably does not involve the pcaf protein. within the first n-terminal  <dig> aa of e1a, the 12– <dig> region has the highest score for the probability of forming an α-helix and this property is conserved through five adenovirus serotypes  <cit> . the rap <dig> subunit of tfiif and the tata-box binding protein  were shown to interact in vitro with aa 1– <dig> of e1a  <cit> . severino et al  <cit>  reported that aa 1– <dig> of e1a are responsible for the interaction with the rack <dig> protein. we have screened a cdna library by the yeast two-hybrid system using aa 12– <dig> of e1a as a bait. clones corresponding to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , the ureb <dig> and the mycbp proteins have been isolated . experiments are in progress to determine if one of these factors is involved in the regulation of the k <dig> promoter in sw613-s cells.

a role for ctbp <dig> and brca <dig> in the regulation of the k <dig> promoter
e1a mutants that have lost the 12– <dig> inhibitory region, acquired a stimulatory potential on the activity of the k <dig> promoter, specifically in nt cells, provided that they retain the c-terminal region of the viral protein. within this region, aa 281– <dig>  which are part of the ctbp <dig> binding site, are essential to the stimulatory effect and an excess of ctbp <dig> protein abolishes this effect. the ctbp <dig> protein is a corepressor, which represses promoters by hdac-dependent or hdac-independent mechanisms. we have previously shown  <cit>  that the activity of the k <dig> promoter is stimulated by hdac inhibitors , specifically in nt cells. we also made the observation that the k <dig> promoter could be stimulated in nt cells by forced recruitment to the promoter of a gal <dig> fusion protein containing the histone acetyl-transferase  domain of cbp or of an acidic activator  known to interact with hat complexes. mutations of aa residues involved in the hat activity of cbp or in the interaction of vp <dig> with hat complexes strongly reduced the stimulation. we conclude that the activity of the k <dig> promoter is repressed in nt cells by a mechanism involving the ctbp <dig> and hdac proteins. ctbp <dig> is most probably acting through an hdac-dependent mechanism because  we have reported  <cit>  that the stimulatory effects by sodium butyrate and by the e1a-Δcr <dig> mutant are not additive;  forced recruitment of a gal4-ctbp <dig> fusion protein on a k <dig> promoter engineered with gal <dig> binding sites strongly inhibits the activity in both t and nt cells and this inhibition cannot be reversed by sodium butyrate . these last results indicate that ctbp <dig> can inhibit the k <dig> promoter by an hdac-independent mechanism but in this case, inhibition is not cell type specific. stimulation of the activity of the k <dig> promoter by some e1a mutants in nt cells is most likely due to a relief of the repressive mechanism operating in these cells. the fact that these mutants have no stimulatory effect in t-type cells suggests that the high activity of the promoter reflects a reversal of the same repression mechanism, possibly through the expression of some constitutively high histone/factor acetyl-transferase  activity in these cells . our results are in agreement with those obtained by others. grooteclaes et al.  <cit>  reported that the k <dig> gene is derepressed in embryo fibroblasts from mice with homozygous compound knockout of the ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> genes. in addition, the k <dig> gene is repressed in knockout cells infected with a ctbp <dig> retroviral vector. schuierer et al.  <cit>  found that the e1a protein activates the expression of the ap2α gene by interfering with ctbp <dig>  sundqvist et al.  <cit>  have reported that the ctbp <dig> interacting region of e1a relieves the hdac-dependent repression of transcription by ctbp <dig> 

we propose that ctbp <dig> and associated hdac could be recruited to the preinitiation complex by a brca1/ctip complex. such a role for brca <dig> was not reported previously although it is known that brca <dig> is associated with the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme. some examples of transcriptional repression by brca <dig> were reported. it represses c-myc-mediated stimulation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter  <cit> . brca <dig> functions as a corepressor for the transcriptional repressor zbrk <dig>  <cit> . experiments using dna microarrays have indicated that the brca <dig>  ctbp <dig>  ctbp <dig> and ctip genes are expressed at comparable levels in t and nt cells of the sw613-s cell line . this was also the case for genes coding for hdac- <dig> to - <dig> and hdac- <dig> to - <dig>  the hdac- <dig> gene was found to be overexpressed  <dig>  fold in nt cells, as compared to t cells, and this was confirmed by western blot analysis. however, in transient expression assays, the activity of the k <dig> promoter was unaffected by overproducing the hdac- <dig> protein, both in t and nt cells , indicating that the low level of accumulation of hdac- <dig> in t-type cells is not responsible for the high activity of the promoter in these cells. it could be argue that a gene coding for one of these factors is specifically mutated in t cells. this seems highly unlikely since the k <dig> promoter is also deregulated in stable transfectants obtained from nt cells using a c-myc expression vector and which acquired all the phenotypic properties of t-type cells .

a model for the differential activity of the k <dig> promoter
to summarize the observations we made on the differential regulation of the k <dig> promoter between t and nt cells of the sw613-s cell line, we propose the model presented in figure  <dig>  several aspects are still speculative but it is compatible with all the results we have obtained so far. the expression level of the k <dig> gene in nt cells is comparable to that observed in normal epithelial cells of human colon  <cit> . our results indicate that, in nt cells, the k <dig> promoter is in fact subjected to a repression mechanism involving the ctbp <dig> protein and hdacs, probably in order to keep in check the expression level of the k <dig> gene. the data presented suggest that ctbp <dig> and associated hdacs could be recruited to the preinitiation complex by a brca1/ctip complex . in our model, the target of hdacs is a factor , whose acetylation level is controlled by a balance between hdac and hat/fat activities. the activity of the k <dig> promoter would be dependent on the acetylation level of s. we have reported previously that the acetylation state of histones h <dig> and h <dig>  as well as the structure of the chromatin, are the same in t and nt cells in the region of the k <dig> promoter  <cit> . in addition, the mechanism responsible for the differential activity is acting on the minimal promoter and no specific sequence is required. therefore, we propose that s is a non-histone protein which is a component of the preinitiation complex and is acetylated by a fat activity.

in t-type cells, the fat activity recruited to the preinitiation complex would be higher, because the enzyme is overproduced or more active in these cells. the high fat activity would shift the balance toward an hyperacetylated state of s. we propose that this protein with fat activity  is the target of the 12– <dig> domain of e1a . the viral protein, or its mutant forms retaining a functional 12– <dig> domain, would inhibit the fat activity. this would result in the inhibition of the promoter. it is very likely that the factor with fat activity is not the p300/cbp or pcaf proteins because we identified e1a mutants disabled in their capacity to bind to these factors but that are still able to efficiently inhibit the activity of the promoter in t-type cells. in the context of our model and as a novel candidate fat activities, it is interesting to note recent reports describing the autoacetylation of the general transcription factor tfiib  <cit>  and of the rap <dig> subunit of tfiif  <cit> .

e1a mutants with no functional 12– <dig> domain but retaining the c-terminal pldls motif would prevent by competition the recruitment of ctbp <dig> and hdacs to the preinitiation complex . in nt cells, this would shift the balance towards hyperacetylation of s despite the low fat activity of the f protein, resulting in a stimulation of the promoter. such mutants are not expected to have an effect in t-type cells since the high fat activity in these cells already supersede that of hdacs. finally, the proposed model offers an explanation to the observation that inhibition of the promoter in t cells and stimulation in nt cells are apparently exclusive phenomena. indeed, according to the model, no e1a mutant is expected to have both capabilities.

CONCLUSIONS
the promoter of the keratin  <dig> gene is deregulated in cells of the human colon carcinoma cell line sw613-s by an unusual mechanism that is acting on the minimal promoter and involves alteration of an acetylation mechanism acting on a non-histone substrate. we report here that the adenoviral e1a protein and some of its mutants specifically interfere with this mechanism through two regions of the protein: the c-terminal ctbp <dig> binding domain and a domain spanning aa 12– <dig>  our results lead us to conclude that, in colon epithelial cells, the expression level of the k <dig> gene is kept in check by a repression mechanism involving the ctbp <dig>  hdac and brca <dig> proteins. this mechanism is altered in sw613-s colon carcinoma cells that overexpress the k <dig> gene. since it is acting at the level of the preinitiation complex, its alteration most probably participates in the deregulated expression of many genes in these tumor cells.
