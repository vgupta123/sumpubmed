BACKGROUND
the “peyote” is a small, fleshy cactus without spines that grows wild in the mexican highlands and in the arid regions of south-western united states  <cit> . peyote belongs to the genus lophophora, which includes two species, l. williamsii and l. diffusa  <cit> . this plant is capable of producing large amounts of alkaloids with psychotropic activity, such as β-phenylethylamine  or tetrahydroisoquinoline , which are derived from the amino acid tyrosine  <cit> . the function of most alkaloids in plants is unclear and their importance in metabolism is highly controversial.

since the identification of morphine in  <dig>  contained in opium poppy , more than ten thousand alkaloids with different properties and a variety of biological activities have been isolated from plants. alkaloids are heterocyclic compounds that contain a nitrogen atom. the position of the nitrogen atom in the hydrocarbon ring varies among different alkaloids and different plant families. the levels of alkaloids in plants also vary from trace amounts to up to 10 % of dry weight, and a single plant species might contain over one hundred of different types. most alkaloids are highly toxic and therefore have the potential to function in the chemical defense arsenal of plants against attack by herbivores and microorganisms. for example, nicotine  inhibits the growth of tobacco hornworm larvae, and the purified compound can also be applied as an effective insecticide in greenhouses. in addition, alkaloids have been suggested to serve as a storage form of nitrogen or as protectants against damage by ultraviolet light  <cit> . alkaloids have traditionally been of great interest to humans because of their pronounced physiological and medical properties  . peyote mescaline  is a class i hallucinogenic alkaloid, and although it is chemically unrelated to lysergic acid diethyl amide , the hallucinogenic effects of mescaline are similar to those of lsd, albeit longer lasting  <cit> . for centuries, north american indigenous peoples have used mescaline as a medicine, and as a part of hallucinogenic religious sacrament  <cit> . the ceremonial use of peyote alkaloids has masked and mythologized the potential use of peyote in modern medicine. for example, some of the illnesses treated with peyote by mexican natives are tuberculosis, pneumonia, scarlet fever, intestinal ills, diabetes, rheumatic pains, colds, grippe, fevers, and venereal diseases, which is why peyote is officially listed in the mexican pharmacopoeia  <cit> .

although l. williamsii is morphologically similar to l. diffusa, these two species differ in stem color, the presence or absence of ribs and furrows across stems, and the color of flowers. while l. williamsii has blue-green or sometimes reddish-green stems with ribs and furrows and the flower is usually pink, l. diffusa shows yellowish-green stems without ribs and the flower is usually white. additionally, it has been proposed that l. williamsii specimens can be classified into two groups according to:  differences in button morphology, such as size of protuberances on the epidermis of stem,  levels of mescaline, and  differences between their chloroplast trnl/trnf regions  <cit> .

next-generation sequencing technologies, such gs-flx  and pgm  pyrosequencing, have the potential to dramatically increase the availability of sequence data in non-model plants that lack complete genome sequence information. in order to identify genes with potential relevance in mescaline biosynthetic pathways, we sequenced and assembled  <dig>  mpb of l. williamsii transcriptome data using both the gs-flx and pgm pyrosequencing platforms. additionally, using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis , we provide evidence that some alkaloids present in peyote are confined to specific organs; for example, mescaline was only detected in the peyote buttons  but not in roots. this work provides one of the first catalogs of genes present in a medicinally relevant member of the cactaceae family, a horticulturally important group of plants.

RESULTS
mescaline content analysis
in order to perform transcriptome analysis of mescaline-producing cacti, we collected samples in cuatro cienegas, coahuila, mexico. to confirm the identity of the collected samples, the intergenic spacer region trnl/trnf sequence was amplified using previously reported primers  <cit>  and sequenced . the sequence obtained was 879 bp, corresponding to the typical size reported for group  <dig> of l. williamsii species, which contain mescaline  <cit>  . to explore the content of alkaloids present in l. williamsii, a standard alkaloid extraction procedure  was carried out for the roots and buttons  from one of the peyote plants collected. the extracts were then analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry . several compounds were then reliably identified by comparison against internal library spectra . some of the detected compounds include hordenine, n-methylmescaline, n-acetylmescaline, pellotine, anhalonine, anhalidine, anhalonidine, o-methylanhalonidine, and lophophorine. not all of these substances exhibit psychopharmacological activity when administered singly, but in combination, they apparently potentiate the effects of the mescaline and definitely alter some characteristics for the experience. alkaloids such as lophophorine can be detected in extracts derived from both button and roots while some others like hordenine, which possess antibacterial properties, presumably because of their phenolic function  <cit> , were detected only in roots . mescaline, with retention time ≈  <dig> , was detected in buttons, but barely present in root extracts, to levels of  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively. these results show that mescaline accumulation is almost totally confined to peyote buttons.

sequencing and de novo assembly of the l. williamsii transcriptome
in order to explore the peyote transcriptome, we synthesized cdna from pooled rnas isolated from both roots and buttons. the cdnas were used to construct sequencing libraries for two  <dig> genome sequencer platforms , generating a total of  <dig>  sequence reads  with an overall average read length of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively . in order to identify genes with preferential expression in either roots or buttons, an additional two sequencing runs were performed using a pgm™ sequencer , for which each organ  was distinguished by using ion barcode adapters. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads was generated with the pgm sequencer . 454-reads were masked using the seqclean software in order to eliminate sequence regions that could cause incorrect assembly. targets for masking included poly a/t tails, ends rich in undetermined bases, and low complexity sequences. for the ion-reads, we first used the fastx tool kit  to separate reads according to the specific barcodes, whereafter the barcodes were trimmed and the remaining sequences were filtered. only high quality ion-reads ranging from  <dig> to 150 bp, for which a maximum of  <dig> bases with a quality phred score below  <dig> were allowed, were used in this study. in total,  <dig>  masked 454-reads and  <dig> , <dig> high quality ion-reads , were considered to obtain de novo assembly of the peyote transcriptome. an overview of the sequencing dataset is presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  the sequenced reads were assembled using mira  <cit> , which is an assembler that can integrate various platform data and perform true hybrid assemblies specially for de novo transcriptomes  <cit> . this assembly resulted in a total of  <dig>  transcripts  that were used in a second assembly step using cap <dig>  <cit>  to eliminate redundant sequences and increase transcript length. this assembly resulted in  <dig>  contigs with lengths ranging from  <dig>  to ~ <dig>  kbp. only contigs larger than 200 bp , for which the mean length was  <dig>  bp, were considered as unigenes for further analysis .

sequence annotation
the  <dig>  l. williamsii unigenes were annotated by sequence similarity blastx searches against arabidopsis thaliana  and reference plant proteins  datasets. a total of  <dig>   unigenes showed significant similarity  to arabidopsis or the refseq databases . the high percentage of l. williamsii unigenes obtained in this study that did not match the refseq protein database  indicates that there is potential for the discovery of as-yet undescribed and novel plant genes in peyote, although many of these unigenes may represent non-coding rnas or untranslated regions . in addition, the significance of a blast search depends on the length of the query sequence; therefore, short sequences are rarely matched to known genes  <cit> , or these sequences may represent rapidly evolving parts of genes that have diverged substantially from their homologs  <cit> . based on the arabidopsis top hits, we obtained the gene ontology annotations  for  <dig>  l. williamsii unigenes . using the wego software  <cit>  unigenes with arabidopsis hits were assigned to gene ontology classes with  <dig>  functional terms. biological processes comprised the majority of the functional terms , followed by cellular components  and molecular functions  . in addition, using the kegg automatic annotation server  from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> , enzyme commission  numbers  <cit>  and kegg orthology  codes were also associated to each annotated l. williamsii unigene.  <dig>  unigenes having ko codes were assigned to metabolic, genetic and environmental information processing pathways . kegg metabolic pathways that are well-represented by l. williamsii unigenes belong to carbohydrate, amino acid, energy and lipid metabolism . in the subclass secondary metabolism, the greatest number of unique sequences was mapped to phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways, for which tyrosine is the initial precursor . this result was expected considering that l. williamsii classes i and ii alkaloids are also derived from this amino acid.fig.  <dig> pathway assignment based on kegg. a major categories based on molecular interaction and reaction networks. b subclasses and gene distribution in the ‘biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites’ category



in order to explore if the l. williamsii unigene database comprised a deep representation of the complex metabolic pathways that characterize plant genomes, some well-known metabolic pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, and carbon fixation during photosynthetic process  were reconstructed . with only a few exceptions, the proteins involved in these metabolic pathways were found in the peyote transcriptome. in most cases, more than one transcript sequence was found to encode the same enzyme. such unique sequences may represent different fragments of a single transcript or different members of a gene family. these results indicate that the l. williamsii unigene database comprises a good representation of the peyote transcriptome, permitting its use as a source to discover candidate genes responsible for mescaline biosynthesis.

detection of preferentially expressed unigenes
given that mescaline accumulates only in the peyote buttons, it is tempting to think that genes involved in mescaline biosynthesis are also preferentially expressed in these organs. considering that independent samples of mrna from l. williamsii isolated from button and roots were used to construct the pgm libraries, an rna-seq approach was used to analyze the expression profile of obtained unigenes. all of  <dig> , <dig> high quality ion-reads  were mapped independently to the l. williamsii transcriptome, and an expression profile matrix containing the unigenes  and the number of mapped reads in each normalized organ-specific transcriptome , was created .

it has been argued that a high number of reads  are required to perform gene expression analysis  <cit> . considering the number of sequences generated in the present study, we used relative frequency values  to make reads counts comparable among samples. this method has been previously used for the efficient detection of differentially expressed genes  <cit>  . the significance of differential gene expression between buttons and roots was determined using the likelihood ratios  method described by stekel et al.  <cit> . this approach is based on a single statistical test that can be used to describe the extent to which a gene is differentially expressed between libraries. briefly, all unigenes  were used to calculate a log likelihood ratio that trends asymptotically to a χ <dig> distribution in which r values ≥  <dig> can be considered significantly preferentially expressed genes. additionally, a fold change of at least 2-fold  was also considered. a total of  <dig> unigenes was identified as preferentially expressed,  <dig> in buttons and  <dig> in roots . interestingly, theorgan-enriched, differentially expressed genes reflect known organ-specific biological activities. sixty unigenes  selected as preferentially expressed in buttons are involved in energy metabolism . considering these results we suggest that the gene expression profiles found for each library can be used for the identification of genes involved in specific metabolic pathways.

crassulacean acid metabolism
crassulacean acid metabolism, which often operates in species subjected to low-water conditions, is a key adaptation in flowering plants. this metabolism increases the efficiency of photosynthesis by increasing co <dig> and carbon capture in plant tissues, where temporal separation of the photosynthetic stages prevents water loss due to transpiration. this mechanism is mediated mainly by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase , malate dehydrogenase , nadp-dependent malate dehydrogenase , and pyruvate phosphate dikinase   <cit> . at the end, co <dig> is available as a substrate for rubisco in the calvin cycle. besides these enzymes, a set of sugar transporters, na+/h+ antiporters and aquaporins are needed to maintain favorable conditions for cam  <cit> .

available genetic and genomic resources in cam plants, including ananas comosus l, agave deserti, agave tequilana, opuntia ficus-indica,and mesembryanthemum crystallinum, have revealed cam genetic determinants , some of which have been proposed to encode homologs of candidate regulatory proteins such as toc <dig>  cca <dig>  rpp <dig>  and ztl . toc <dig> binds to the g-box and ee-motif promoter regions of genes involved in both the morning and evening transcription-translation feedback loops that drive the plant circadian clock; these genes include prr <dig> and cca <dig> in the morning feedback loop. discrete induction of toc <dig> gene expression results in reduced cca <dig> and prr <dig> expression, indicating that toc <dig> plays a repressive rather than stimulatory role in regulating circadian gene expression  <cit> . the dark-dependent degradation of toc <dig> protein requires expression of ztl, and is prevented by inhibiting the proteosome pathway; therefore, the toc1-ztl interaction is important in the control of toc <dig> and is responsible for the regulation of circadian period  <cit> . furthermore, recent work in orchidaceae demonstrated that cam has evolved at least  <dig> times independently in different families including both monocots and eudicots  <cit> . a full understanding of cam biology requires the identification and analysis of the genes that code for enzymes and regulators of this mechanism. sequencing efforts in the present work have captured most of the putative orthologous genes of cam metabolism in l. williamsii. additional file 2: figure s <dig> shows the enzymes involved in cam whose genes are identified in our unigene dataset, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase , malate dehydrogenase   , malate dehydrogenase . also, several sequences in the unigene dataset were annotated as sugar transporters, antiporters or aquaporins .

among the annotated unigenes, un <dig> and un <dig> were highly similar to arabidopsis ztl  and cca <dig>  respectively . these unigenes are unique sequences matching known circadian clock regulators related with cam. it remains to be determined whether these sequences indeed represent the orthologs of arabidopsis ztl and cca <dig>  and whether they play a role in the circadian regulation of cam in peyote.

identification of lophophora williamsii unigenes with potential relevance to the biosynthetic pathway of mescaline
the in vivo pathway for the synthesis of mescaline was first proposed by paul et al.,  <cit>  . starting from tyrosine , the main intermediates are dopa , dopamine , and  <dig> ,5-trihydroxy-β-phenyethylamine , resulting in mescaline . these reactions include hydroxylation of  to , decarboxylation to , hydroxylation to  and methylation to . all enzymes required for the formation of tyrosine from glucose are represented in the l. williamsii unigene database . enzymes selected as candidates for involvement in mescaline biosynthesis were postulated based on the high sequence similarity of homologous genes and their expression profiles.fig.  <dig> biosynthetic pathway of mescaline in lophophora williamsii. the main intermediates in the pathway are tyrosine , dopa  dopamine   <dig> ,5-trihydroxy-β-phenyethylamine , and mescaline . this figure was modified from  <cit> 



tyrosine/dopa decarboxylation
opium poppy  is the source of several pharmaceutical benzylisoquinoline alkaloids including morphine, codeine and sanguinarine. the biosynthesis of these alkaloids starts with the condensation of two tyrosine derivatives, dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. the formation of dopamine involves the decarboxylation of tyrosine  and/or dihydrophenylalanine  by tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase   <cit> . the members of the tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase  gene family in opium poppy can be categorized into two subgroups according to their sequence homology. representative members of each subgroup  share 73 % amino acid identity, and both encoded enzymes exhibit l-dopa and l-tyrosine decarboxylase activities  <cit> . three different l. williamsii unigenes  were annotated as homologous to arabidopsis aromatic aldehyde synthase . this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine and  <dig> -dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine to phenylacetaldehyde and dopaldehyde, respectively  <cit> . according to the best blast hits annotation derived from the refseq-plant database, these unigenes are homologs of tyrosine decarboxylase , a predicted protein in populus trichocarpa,and a tyrosine/dopa decarboxylase in glycine max. part of the distinctive pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase conserved domain  was identified in both un <dig> and un <dig> peyote unigenes by motif/domain search against the pfam database . in contrast, the coding region represented in unigene un <dig> is homologous only to the carboxy-terminal portion of the ataas protein. using the seaview program  <cit> , the protein-coding nucleotide sequences were aligned based on their corresponding amino acid translations . a phylogenetic tree of peyote unigenes based on their pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylase domain sequence, including the tdyc <dig>  tdyc <dig> and ataas proteins, was generated . un <dig> was grouped with opium poppy tdyc sequences while the un <dig> unigene was grouped in the same clade with ataas. these data suggest that at least an ortholog to the p.somniferumtycd  is present in l. williamsii, which could be responsible for tyrosine conversion to dopamine in this species. interestingly, according to the relative frequency values obtained, these peyote unigenes showed higher levels of transcripts in buttons than in roots .fig.  <dig>

hydroxylation of aromatic compounds
considering that during mescaline biosynthesis, dopamine is hydroxylated to form  <dig> ,5-trihydroxy-β-phenyethylamine, the l. williamsii transcriptome was surveyed in order to identify homologs of some biochemically characterized plant enzymes capable of introducing the hydroxyl group  into aromatic compounds , especially those whose substrate is an aromatic amino acid that contains a single benzene ring.

polyphenol oxidases  catalyze the o-hydroxylation of monophenols  to o-diphenols . they can also further catalyze the oxidation of o-diphenols to produce o-quinones  <cit> . tyrosinases are bifunctional ppos that catalyze the o-hydroxylation of monophenols and subsequent oxidation of o-diphenols to quinines  <cit> . thus, tyrosinases accept both mono- and di-phenols as substrates. the hydroxylation ability of the enzyme is also referred to as cresolase or monophenolase activity , and the oxidation ability as catecholase or diphenolase activity . the monophenolase activity of tyrosinases is known to be the initial rate-determining reaction  <cit> . in tyrosinase-catalyzed reactions, molecular oxygen is used as an electron acceptor that is reduced to water. tyrosinases and their corresponding genes have been characterized from various sources, including bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals  <cit> . a sequence comparison of recently published tyrosinases reveals high heterogeneity concerning their length and overall identity. however, highly conserved regions among all tyrosinases can be found in the active site domain  <cit> . the peyote unigene un <dig> was annotated as a homolog of glycine max ppo . a motif/domain search revealed that a kfdv-containg ppo <dig> c-terminal domain  can be identified in the translated sequence corresponding to this peyote unigene . this domain family is found in association with the common central domain of tyrosinase , and is typically between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in length. even though the functional significance of these domains is not known, many members of this family are plant or plastid polyphenol oxidases with the highly conserved sequence motif kfdv, from which the name derives  <cit> .

an in-depth blast search, for which the coding sequence of the pop <dig> kfdv domain was used as reference , revealed that no additional ppos could be identified in the peyote unigene dataset. although unigene un <dig> could be considered as an interesting candidate to participate in mescaline biosynthesis, in contrast to unigene un <dig> , its transcript levels indicate that un <dig> is preferentially expressed in roots rather than buttons .

folate- or tetrahydropterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases  are an additional group of enzymes localized in chloroplasts capable of catalizing the o-hydroxylation of the benzene ring of aromatic amino acids . however, homologs of this family, which comprise phenylalanine , tyrosine , and tryptophan  hydroxylases  <cit> , are not present in our l. williamsii unigene dataset. this was expected considering that thus far, such genes have been identified only in non-flowering plants  <cit> .

α-keto acid dependent enzymes catalyze dealkylations, epimerizations and halogenations, hydroxylation, and a variety of oxidations  <cit> . fe2+/α-keto acid-dependent oxygenases represent a group of dioxygenases  that use α-ketoglutarate  as substrate, incorporating two oxygen atoms from o <dig> into two different substrates where one atom is transferred to the actual substrate, and the second one to the α-kg acting as the co-substrate . a large variety of compounds such as flavonoids and alkaloids may be synthesized by fe2+/α-kg-dependent dioxygenases in plants . other types of enzymes such as 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  have no relationship in sequence but do show a similar reaction mechanism to fe2+/α-kg hydroxylases, and these enzymes also contain ferrous iron  in the active site, but the α-keto acid that is decaoxylated is part of the substrate and the hydroxylation is associated with an ‘nih’ shift . 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, which catalyzes the formation of  <dig> -dihydroxyphenylacetate , has been found in all aerobic forms of life where it is involved in tyrosine metabolism  <cit> .

through a blast search based on the distinctive 2og-feii-oxy domain  of the fe2+/α-kg oxygenases, a total of  <dig> peyote unigenes were identified as members of this family. these unigenes were aligned against their plant homologs, identified in the annotation process as the top blast hits against the refseq database. to identify the coding sequences in their correct open reading frames, we used the known plant homologs as references and protein-coding nucleotide sequences were aligned based on their corresponding amino acid translations using the seaview program . among  <dig> peyote unigenes, complete  coding sequences  ranging between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp were identified. additionally, a highly conserved non-heme dioxygenase n-terminal domanin , commonly associated with 2-oxoglutarate/fe-dependent dioxygenase proteins, was identified in the peyote unigene set . the phylogenetic relationships among peyote fe2+/α-kg oxygenases, and their expression profiles, were analyzed . six of these unigenes showed highest expression levels in buttons, and four of them had two-fold or greater transcription in roots .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships, primary protein structures and expression patterns of l. williamsii fe2+/α-keto acid-dependent oxygenases. a ml un-rooted phylogenetic tree. b schematic representation of domain structure along the length of protein. diox-n  and 2og-feii-oxy  domains are represented by green and orange boxes, respectively. c expression analysis of l. williamsii unigenes in buttons and roots performed by rnaseq



with regard to hppd proteins , a similar approach was used to identify putative homologs. using the glyoxalase domain , a single putative l. williamsii hppd cds was identified . the predicted protein showed around  <dig>  % amino acid identity compared with the published medicago truncatula hppd. the relative abundance values indicate that the transcripts of this hppd are almost 200-fold higher in roots than in the peyote buttons .

considering the results described above, it is proposed that one of the fe2+/α-kg oxygenases expressed preferentially in buttons is a prime candidate for involvement in the hydroxylation of dopamine during mescaline biosynthesis.

o-methyltransferases of l. williamsii
enzymatic o-methylation consists of the transfer of the methyl group of a common co-substrate such as s-adenosyl-l-methionine  to the hydroxyl group of an acceptor molecule. this process is catalyzed by an o-methyltransferase  , a group of enzymes that methylate a wide range of compounds with a high degree of selectivity  <cit> . these enzymes are present in diverse organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and mammals. however, a few omts have been shown to be multifunctional enzymes that catalyze the methylation of structurally related compounds such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids . in plants, o-methyltransferases constitute a large family of enzymes. novel omt-like gene sequences have been reported using a framework phylogenetic tree encompassing  <dig> biochemically characterized plant omt protein sequences for improved prediction of their putative function  <cit> . in order to identify omt-like sequences, these proteins were used as reference in a blast similarity search  against the l. williamsii unigene dataset. a total of eleven omt-like sequences , in which the cds for the o-methyltransferase conserved domain  was present, were found in the peyote transcriptome database. to identify the coding sequences in their correct open reading frames, these peyote unigenes were aligned based on their corresponding amino acid translations against their best-blast-hits homologs . with only two exceptions , these unigenes contain complete  coding sequences. a phylogenetic tree was generated in which the proteins derived from these peyote cds and their homologs were included .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of omt peyote unigenes and the phylogenetic relationships of their deduced proteins with those from various other plant species. a phylogenetic relationship of plant omts. b expression profile of omts genes in buttons and roots of l. williamsii plants



the phylogenetic structure of the l. williamsii omt gene family was similar to that previously reported by lam et al.  <cit> . two distinct monophyletic lineages were recognized , one of which , includes three sister clades . with only one exception , the remaining clades contain at least one putative omt identified in the peyote transcriptome . clade a contains plant omts with s-adenosyl-l-methionine  dependent methyltransferase activity, which acts on a diverse group of metabolites including salicylic acid, benzoic acid and indole-3-acetic acid   .

clade bi contains six different peyote unigenes  grouped with only two different plant omts: one lignin bispecific caffeic acid/5-hydroxy ferulic acid omt   <cit>  and one flavonoids/caffeoyl-coa omt   <cit> . clade bii contains two peyote unigenes  that were grouped with two plant caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferases   <cit> . finally, clade biii, which contained no peyote unigenes, includes some flavonoid omts .

mescaline biosynthesis in peyote plants requires the triple-methylation of  <dig> ,5-trihydroxy-β-phenyethylamine  to ). considering the chemical structure of substrates such caffeoyl-coa, 5-hydroxy ferulic and/or caffeic acid, and that plant omts may have specific or promiscuous activities, we propose that  <dig> ,5-trihydroxy-β-phenyethylamine could serve as the methyl acceptor  for one or more l. williamsii omts classified in the bi and/or bii monophyletic lineages, especially those whose transcript levels are more abundant in buttons than in peyote roots . interestingly, only three peyote omts showed increased levels of transcripts in buttons compared to roots.

un <dig> was resolved as a member of clade a , and even though the abundance of the transcript was calculated to be  <dig> -fold higher in buttons than in roots, transcripts related to this omt were detected in both organs. this was expected since metabolites such as salicylic acid, benzoic acid, and jasmonic acid play crucial roles in numerous pathways, controlling the way in which plants grow and develop  <cit> . with respect to unigenes un <dig> and un <dig>  which were grouped in clade bi as two closely related omts, their transcript levels were quite low in roots and 20-fold higher in buttons. based on these results, we propose that un <dig>  un <dig>  or both unigenes could be considered as primary candidates to belong to the mescaline biosynthesis pathway.

real-time quantitative pcr verification
transcriptional regulation revealed by rna-seq data was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription pcr . a total of seven peyote unigenes was selected as primary candidate genes involved in mescaline biosynthesis . a linear regression analysis showed an overall correlation coefficient of r =  <dig> , which indicates a good correlation between transcript abundance assayed by real-time pcr and transcription profiles revealed by rna-seq data .

CONCLUSIONS
the l. williamsii transcriptome provides a detailed genomic window on metabolic processes that are carried out in a cactus plant capable of accumulating high levels of alkaloids. the transcriptome of buttons  and roots of peyote vary significantly in terms of the genes that can be identified in each and their consequent expression profiles. these variations could be responsible, at least in part, for the identities of the organs but also could explain differences in terms of the metabolites that are accumulated. most genes involved in cam metabolism, typical of slow-growing cacti in desert regions, were identified and can be used as starting points to study the regulation of genes that allow co <dig> fixation and stomatal aperture during nighttime, as opposed to c <dig> and c <dig> plants that carry out this process during the day. genes putatively involved in the biogenesis of mescaline were identified in this work by comparing their expression levels in button and roots. this report provides a catalogue of specific candidate genes that can be further expressed in heterologous systems in order to confirm their putative roles in mescaline biosynthesis.
