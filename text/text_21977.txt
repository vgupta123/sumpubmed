BACKGROUND
in the past, we applied inductive reasoning  <cit>  to identify immunologic signatures associated with tumor rejection, clearance of pathogen, acute allograft rejection or autoimmunity. this exercise leads to the formulation of the "immunologic constant of rejection"  hypothesis: "immune-mediated tissue specific destruction  follows a common final pathway independent of the originating cause and the disease context"  <cit> .  <dig> axioms were proposed at the basis of the icr: i) tsd does not necessarily occur because of non-self recognition but also occurs against self or quasi-self; ii) the requirements for the induction of a cognate immune response differ from those necessary for the activation of an effector one; iii) although the prompts leading to tsd vary in distinct pathologic states, the effector immune response converges into a single mechanism; and iv) adaptive immunity participates as a tissue-specific trigger, but it is not always sufficient or necessary. here, we applied deductive reasoning to test whether immunologic markers of icr could be predictably observed in a controllable experimental model. we selected a promising pre-clinical endeavor where the systemic administration of oncolytic vacv induces xenograft regression in immune deficient mice through an, at least in part, immunologically-mediated mechanism. in addition, we tested the validity of the fourth axiom, which postulates, in concordance with others' observations, that tumor rejection does not require adaptive immunity  <cit> .

systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses leads to their specific localization to established tumors and to viral replication followed by oncolysis  <cit> . vacv, in particular, possesses strong antitumor properties  <cit>  while its history as vaccine against smallpox proves it safe in humans. further attenuation by disruption of non essential viral genes such as j2r   <cit>  and a56r   <cit>  increased the therapeutic potential of vacv as an oncolytic agent. in addition, the same construct could be used for tumor-specific delivery of light-emitting proteins for real-time imaging  <cit>  or therapeutic proteins such as tumor suppressors  <cit> , anti-angiogenesis factors  <cit>  or immune modulators  <cit> . the design of a vacv construct, glv-1h <dig>  derived from livp wild-type strain by insertion of  <dig> expression cassettes encoding renilla luciferase-aequorea green fluorescent fusion protein , β-galactosidase and β-glucoronidase  <cit>  lead to a highly attenuated oncolytic virus capable of targeting established human xenografts. the ability to replicate specifically within tumors and to leave non malignant tissues virus-free makes glv-1h <dig> systemic administration a promising pre-clinical tool capable of safely eradicating pancreatic cancer  <cit> , malignant pleural mesothelioma  <cit> , breast carcinoma gi-101a xenografts  <cit>  and anaplastic thyroid cancer  <cit> .

eradication of established human breast cancer gi-101a xenografts can be reproducibly induced in nude mice injected intravenously with  <dig> ×  <dig> plaque forming units  of glv-1h <dig>  tumor eradication occurs in 95% of treated animals within  <dig> days from injection and it is associated with pristine tropism of glv-1h <dig> for the xenograft and lack of systemic toxicity or mortality. because glv-1h <dig> encodes a luciferase reporter, it is possible to estimate kinetically virus titers in tumor xenografts and correlate this parameter with treatment outcome  <cit> .

experimental observations demonstrated a tight relationship between virus replication within the tumor xenograft and response to oncolytic treatment. however, the mechanisms leading to tumor regression by oncolytic virus remain unknown  <cit> . while it is possible that a direct oncolytic activity may be responsible for tumor regression, it is also possible that tumor eradication is the result of a complex interplay among virus, cancer cells and the host  <cit> . expression profiling of xenografts responding to treatment with glv-1h <dig> based on a mouse-specific platform and hence representative of the host's response to the glv-1h68-infected human xenograft suggested that their eradication is associated with the over-expression of signatures consistent with innate immune defense activation. these signatures are inclusive of interferon-stimulated genes  such as stat- <dig> and irf- <dig>  chemokines , chemokine receptors , interleukins  and innate immune effector functions   <cit> . the participation of immune cells was supported by immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated active peri-tumoral and intra-tumoral infiltration of monocytes in treated samples  <cit> ; however, the specificity of the association between xenograft eradication and immune activation could not be determined since non-responding xenografts were not included in the previous analysis.

we hypothesized that in this model the eradication of responding xenografts is, at least in part, mediated through innate immune mechanisms and, as a consequence, this model could provide important insights about the role played by innate immunity in mediating tissue rejection in the immune incompetent host  <cit> . recent animal studies suggest that immune-mediated eradication of syngeneic tumors is independent of adaptive immune responses  <cit> , and the involvement of cytotoxic t cells may provide primarily help for the in situ targeting and/or activation of innate immune effector cells  <cit> . therefore, progression of events leading to xenograft rejection in a mouse model deprived of adoptive immune function may simplify the identification of the requirements for tumor rejection and, more broadly, those necessary for tsd  <cit> .

to determine which innate responses and virus replication characteristics specifically correlated with oncolytic glv-1h68-mediated tumor rejection, we tested human cancer cell lines of different tissue derivation for their in vitro permissivity to glv-1h <dig> replication, their in vivo colonization and their susceptibility to vacv-mediated eradication. in addition, we used  <dig> array platforms to characterize vacv, human  and mouse  gene expression in glv-1h68-infected xenografts in vivo. the results demonstrated that tumor rejection is associated with activation of innate immune mechanisms in the host that recapitulate faithfully the biological pathways observed in association with immune-mediated tsd in humans  <cit> . thus, this model suggests that immune rejection does not depend upon adaptive immunity as long as the initiating mechanism  is specific to a particular tissue. the demonstration that immune deficient mice can reject human xenograft following a pathway common to other human immune pathologies suggests that the icr is a universal phenomenon across species and may represent a target for immune modulation in the context of various diseases.

RESULTS
variability of xenograft responses to the systemic administration of glv-1h68
a panel of human cancer cell lines of different histological derivation was tested for their sensitivity to the oncolytic activity of intra-venously injected glv-1h <dig>  <cit> .  <dig> characteristic patterns were identified: some cell lines progressively continued their growth independent of therapy , while others followed  <dig> growth phases: first, a slightly faster growth of infected compared to control tumors, then a period of no or minimal growth, and finally, complete regression   <cit>  . tumor growth or regression patterns were cell line-specific, highly reproducible, and independent of number of cancer cells administered or dose of glv-1h <dig> injected  <cit> . a therapeutic index  was calculated to provide a single parameter descriptive of each cell line's responsiveness to vacv therapy by integrating the areas between the median growth of control and treated xenografts  . the same cell lines were subjected to an in vitro assay in which their permissivity to glv-1h <dig> replication was tested . we observed that  <dig> of  <dig> cell lines that resisted replication during the first  <dig> hours following infection  uniformly produced xenografts partially or non-responding to vacv therapy in vivo. however,  <dig> of  <dig> cell lines that allowed viral replication in the first  <dig> hours yielded xenografts responsive in vivo to vacv treatment while  <dig>  yielded xenografts that did not respond. the relationship between the permissivity of a given cell line to in vitro replication of glv-1h <dig> and the in vivo responsiveness of the corresponding xenograft was significant  but not absolute.

of particular interest was a pair of cell lines: the colorectal carcinoma ht- <dig>  and the breast adenocarcinoma gi-101a  cell lines  <cit>  that displayed in vitro a similar degree of permissivity to vacv replication. since the distinct behavior of the  <dig> cell lines could have been due to their diverse ontogeny  <cit> , we tested a pair of autologous melanoma cell lines, 888-mel and 1936-mel derived from the same progenitor cell clone though established from  <dig> metachronous metastases  <cit> ; 888-mel was generated in  <dig> during the earlier stage of disease at a time when the patient underwent a complete remission following adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; 1936-mel was expanded  <dig> years later from a metastasis excised at a time when the patient was rapidly progressing and did not respond to further therapy  <cit> . the cell lines displayed the same degree of permissivity in vitro to glv-1h <dig> replication, but yielded xenografts with disparate sensitivity to vacv treatment in vivo . these data suggest that even in autologous systems responsiveness is related to biological characteristics of the tumors that are independent of their ontogeny, and are more likely related to evolving phenotypes during the natural history of the disease.

we then analyzed vacv replication in vivo in a responding , a non-responding  and another presently less characterized  line. twenty-one days post glv-1h <dig> administration; viral titers were lower in non-responding xenografts . the difference was less pronounced after  <dig> days, suggesting that the lack of responsiveness to oncolytic therapy may be associated with delayed but not completely absent vacv replication.

transcriptional profiling of vacv/tumor/host interactions
to gain better insights on the mechanisms governing xenograft rejection, we compared simultaneously the transcriptional patterns of vacv, human cancer cells and mouse host cells in responding and non-responding xenografts excised at time points associated with tumor and viral growth  or at the plateau phases preceding tumor rejection . this was achieved by the adoption of organism-specific platforms.

transcriptional differences between xenografts responding or non-responding to systemic glv-1h <dig> administration: the vacv signatures
vacv-gene expression was assessed by a custom-made vacv array platform to compare the expression of vacv transcripts in vivo in the responding gi-101a and the non-responding ht- <dig>  xenografts. vacv transcriptional patterns correlated perfectly with viral titers. moreover, in all cell lines there was a perfect correlation between ruc-gfp expression and overall expression of vacv genes  suggesting that this reporter gene accurately represents glv-1h <dig> replication . variation in vacv gene expression was observed among cell lines or among xenografts derived from the same cell line. furthermore, a clear dichotomy was observed in transcriptional patterns: vacv transcripts were either all up regulated or completely silent suggesting that the transition from early to late vacv gene expression occurred in rapid succession that could not be discriminated by the time points examined. most gi-101a xenografts demonstrated early in vivo replication with  <dig> out of  <dig> expressing vacv genes at day  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig> at day  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, ht- <dig> suffered delayed replication in vivo with only a proportion displaying full vacv gene expression at day  <dig> . after  <dig> days the expression of vacv genes was turned on only in  <dig> of  <dig> ht- <dig> xenografts. vacv gene expression analysis confirmed lack of differences in vacv transcriptional patterns in vitro between ht- <dig> and gi-101a with  <dig> out of  <dig> cell cultures demonstrating active viral replication in either case in the first  <dig> hours after infection .

subsequently, comparisons were made between infected and non-infected gi-101a and ht- <dig> xenografts. even though there might have been better responder/non-responder pairs to choose from we selected ht- <dig> tumors among non-responding cell lines because of its similar in vitro permissivity to glv-1h <dig> that corresponded to a different behavior in vivo and previous characterizations in our laboratory. a high-stringency  student t test comparing the number of vacv genes differentially expressed at day  <dig> or  <dig> from infected animals with those from uninfected ones identified significant differences  only in gi-101a xenografts at day  <dig> and day  <dig> . as previously discussed, the number of genes differentially expressed in xenografts with replicating vacv reflected completely the number of vacv-specific annotations present in the vacv-array platform demonstrating that glv-1h <dig> replication is either absent or complete in xenografts at this time point. as to be expected, an almost complete overlap of vacv probes or genes expressed at day  <dig> and  <dig> was observed in the gi-101a xenografts . notably, a reverse behavior was observed in the pattern of expression of human house keeping genes represented in the vacv array platform. the expression of these genes was profoundly down-regulated in permissive cell lines suggesting a shut off of cellular metabolism in infected cells that correlated inversely with viral transcription as described by others  <cit> . it is noteworthy that, although ht- <dig> did not display significant up regulation of vacv genes using the high stringency parameters adopted here, it displayed a similar trend in gene expression with mild up-regulation of vacv genes and expression of gfp messenger rna in some but not all xenografts .

transcriptional differences between xenografts responding or non-responding to systemic glv-1h <dig> administration: the human cancer signatures
a time course analysis evaluating the in vivo effects of viral replication on the permissive gi-101a human xenografts was performed using a custom-made  <dig>  k human cdna array platform  <cit> .  <dig> experimental groups of  <dig> mice each received systemic glv-1h <dig> administration  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days before xenograft excision . the transcriptional profile of infected gi-101a tumors was altered significantly by  <dig> days and increasingly so at  <dig> days after glv-1h <dig> administration. since the time course demonstrated that even in permissive xenografts significant changes occurred only at  <dig> and  <dig> days, we limited the subsequent analysis to these time points.

to better characterize the transcriptional program of vacv-infected cancer cell lines, we compared responding  and non-responding  xenografts using a  <dig> k whole genome, human oligo array platform at day  <dig> and  <dig>  multiple dimensional scaling based on the complete data set demonstrated that infected gi-101a xenografts  segregated completely in euclidian space from non-infected xenografts  while ht- <dig> xenografts intermingled whether they were from infected or non-infected animals .

to test overall differences between xenografts from infected and non-infected animals, we applied a student t test  comparing infected to non-infected gi-101a and ht- <dig> xenografts. comparison of gi-101a identified  <dig>  genes differentially expressed between infected and non-infected xenografts . on the contrary, only  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed by ht- <dig> xenografts from infected compared to non-infected animals . among genes differentially expressed in the gi-101a xenografts from glv-1h <dig> infected animals, the large majority were down-regulated, particularly, in xenografts excised at day  <dig> suggesting that viral replication depresses cellular metabolism  consistent with the down-regulation of house keeping genes observed in the vacv-chip. ingenuity pathway analysis  demonstrated that, among the canonical pathways, the top  <dig> categories of down-regulated genes represented depressed cellular function including alterations in oxidative pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruption of purine, pyrimidine and amino acid metabolism . interestingly, a smaller cluster of genes was over-expressed in gi-101a xenografts from infected animals . among these genes, allograft inflammatory factor- <dig> , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase  <dig>  and the il- <dig> receptor common γ chain were up regulated. moreover, a multivariate analysis  based on the oligo arrays comparing the  <dig> groups at day  <dig> and  <dig>  identified respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  clones differentially expressed among the  <dig> groups. analysis with the  <dig> k cdna arrays similarly identified  <dig>  cdna clones representative of the  <dig> categories at day  <dig>  in both platforms, most of the differences in expression pattern involved tumor cell specific genes and both platforms segregated the ht- <dig> xenografts from gi-101a xenografts independent of glv-1h <dig> administration according to their different ontogeny; a phenomenon we have previously described  <cit> ; however, a subgroup of genes was observed to be specific for gi-101a infected xenografts. the glv-1h <dig> infection-specific signatures were enriched for up regulated genes associated with immune function with a significantly higher than expected frequency  according to geneontology assignment. among the genes up-regulated in the gi-101a xenografts excised from glv-1h <dig> infected mice, several were associated with activation of innate immune mechanisms including the toll-like receptor - <dig>  the interferon regulatory factor - <dig>  signal transducer and activator of t cell - <dig> and tumor necrosis factor -α. this enrichment was not observed in oligo-based arrays suggesting that these signatures could be potentially attributed to host infiltrating immune cells whose genes could cross-hybridize to the less stringent cdna array probes; this could occur in spite of the intensity filter adjustment for sequences with high mouse to human similarity. sequence verification, demonstrated that only stat- <dig> and irf- <dig> were indeed expressed by human cells while the other genes were mouse transcripts cross hybridizing to the cdna probes but not to the more stringent oligo-probes .

in summary, analysis of human transcripts demonstrated that differences among xenografts from infected and non-infected mice are non-existent in non-responding tumors and limited to a small set of up-regulated genes in responding tumors several of them representing over-expression of host's genes cross hybridizing to the human platform. most transcriptional differences in responding tumors were instead due to the shut down of cellular metabolisms induced by active viral infection while little evidence of apoptotic or necrotic induction by the oncolytic process could be identified at this early time point suggesting that at day  <dig> cells are starting to be strongly altered in their metabolism but are still alive; this finding correlates with the presence of viable cancer cells observed by histopathological examination  <cit> .

transcriptional differences between xenografts responding or non-responding to systemic glv-1h <dig> administration: the mouse host's signatures
to define the host's involvement in the early phases of the oncolytic process when tumor cells are still present and alive  <cit> , we analyzed ht- <dig> and gi-101a xenografts using a custom-made, whole genome  <dig> k mouse array platform. in this case, all  <dig> gi-101a xenografts excised at day  <dig> from infected mice could be utilized while only  <dig> of  <dig> could be utilized for the human arrays because of degradation of human mrna in one of the regressing xenografts. gene expression was affected significantly only in gi-101a xenografts . a statistical overview of gene expression modulation of gi-101a xenografts from glv-1h <dig> infected grafts gave a completely opposite picture compared to the human arrays in which a predominant down-regulation of cellular metabolism was observed. in particular, most mouse genes were up regulated in xenografts excised from infected animals suggesting that, while the metabolism of cancer cell was declining , the host response was enhanced . an f test was performed for a global comparison of all experimental groups; at day  <dig>   <dig>  genes demarcated the differences among the  <dig> experimental groups. this number increased to  <dig>  by day  <dig> .

at day  <dig>  ipa reveled that the  <dig> canonical pathways predominantly affected in gi-101a xenografts from vacv-infected mice reflected chemokine and ifn signaling . at day  <dig>  additional canonical pathways became affected including those associated with cellular stress . there was significant overlap among the  <dig> time points when only genes associated with immune function were compared , while most differences between the  <dig> time points were observed among genes associated with cellular stress and altered metabolism. since this manuscript focuses on the immune aspects of oncolytic therapy, we will restrict the discussion to immunologic signatures from now on.

in general, immunologic differences between the early  and the later  time points were quantitative rather than qualitative, therefore, although some transcripts from vacv infections were significantly up regulated at day  <dig> a similar trend could be observed at day  <dig> though it did not reach the same level of statistical significance . additionally, in the majority of cases, the host's transcription was enhanced at the later time point when tumor growth reached a plateau and the rejection process was presumed to start.

among interleukins, il- <dig> and the il- <dig> binding protein played a prominent role early in the course of infection, while later il- <dig> became increasingly up regulated . ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> ligand chemokines played a predominant role at day  <dig> while cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> ligand chemokines up-regulation became more prominent later. among the cxcl chemokines, cxcl-12/sdf- <dig> was previously associated with the rejection of metastatic melanoma during il- <dig> therapy  <cit>  and together with cxcl- <dig> through - <dig> chemokines in association with the rejection of basal cell carcinomas  treated with tlr <dig> agonists  <cit> . isgs and other genes associated with the ifn signaling were among the most up-regulated at either time point studied; these included ifn-γ induced gtpase, whose expression was increased 48-fold at day  <dig> in gi-101a tumors from glv-1h68-infected animals compared to controls. ipa suggested that the majority of up-regulated genes reflected predominantly ifn-γ stimulation, a phenomenon we have observed in bccs regression upon treatment with tlr- <dig> agonists  <cit>  and, more generally, in association with tsd  <cit> ; among them, stat- <dig> and irf- <dig> were previously described in association with tsd  <cit>  and play a central role in the signaling of ifn-γ and other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> .

macrophage presence/function also played an important role  and was associated with over-expression of major histocompatiblity class ii genes supporting the presence of activated macrophages in infected gi-101a xenografts. furthermore, this prominent and specific infiltration could be substantiated by immunohistochemical analyses that demonstrated a strong peri- and intra-tumoral infiltration of mhc class ii-expressing host's cells surrounding virally-infected cancer cells .

although there was only partial overlap between genes up-regulated at day  <dig> and  <dig>  most overlap was due to genes related to immune function. applying a stringent student t test  comparing infected to non-infected gi-101a xenografts at the  <dig> time points, similar results were observed; although less genes were significantly up-regulated at day  <dig>  a good proportion overlapped with day  <dig> and those overlapping genes were exclusively related to immune function . we then re-directed genes with immune function significantly up-regulated in infected gi-101a xenografts into self-organizing biological pathways using ipa; this analysis identified those genes most tightly associated with the immunological network leading to tsd during rejection of gi-101a xenografts; while at day  <dig>  ccl chemokines and stat- <dig> played a central role, at day  <dig>  il- <dig>  stat- <dig> and irf- <dig> played a central role . interestingly, il- <dig>  which was identified as playing a central role in this immune-deficient mouse model; was not previously observed as a component of the icr in immune competent human tissues affected by immune-pathology. finally, as expected no genes associated with b or t cell signaling or function in the grafts were significantly up-regulated at this phase of the immune-response against infected gi-101a xenografts, in accordance with the biology of the host's model system. this data suggest that at least in this model, adaptive immunity is not necessary for tsd.

based on geneontology annotations, we then compiled a database of genes associated to tsd in various immune pathologies in accordance to the icr hypothesis  <cit> . these genes have been described as highly associated with tsd in the context of acute allograft rejection, pathogen clearance during acute infection and tumor rejection during immunotherapy  <cit> . we displayed these a priori and arbitrarily selected genes as a self organizing heat map based on the data from the present study . all were specifically expressed in infected responding tumors compared with non-infected gi-101a and the infected or non-infected ht- <dig> xenografts. this display represents a prospective validation of a universal mechanism leading to tsd in mice as well as in humans.

discussion
immune-mediated tsd is the ultimate manifestation of the effector phase of the immune response and, as we recently argued, may follow a common final pathway independent of the pathological circumstances leading to its occurrence  <cit> . thus, although the mechanisms originating acute allograft rejection, clearance of pathogens during acute infection, flares of autoimmunity or cancer regression may be different, in the end, they all converge into a cascade of immunologic steps capable of turning a chronic and lingering inflammatory process into an acute and destructive one. we argued that, among the  <dig> axioms upon which the icr is founded, adaptive immune responses are neither necessary nor sufficient to induce tissue-specific rejection but rather start a tissue-specific reaction in cases in which such specificity is not determined by other factors. indeed, others have shown that tumor rejection can be determined by innate immune mechanisms  <cit>  and adaptive t cell responses play a role as helpers to stimulate more powerful innate immune effector mechanisms  <cit> . thus, in conditions in which a switch from a chronic to an acute inflammatory process can be induced by other factors like the immune-stimulation induced by the presence of a virus in the target tissue, adaptive immune responses may not be necessary and immune-mediate rejection can occur without the assistance of t or b cells.

this hypothesis is suggested by some human observations. the rejection of skin cancers by the local application of tlr- <dig> agonists occurs without direct evidence of adaptive immune responses  <cit> . also renal cell carcinomas are as sensitive to systemic administration of il- <dig> as metastatic melanoma yet, while in the latter adaptive immune responses are easily demonstrable, in the former, they have been quite elusive, and most likely of secondary significance  <cit> .

xenografts growing in primarily t cell-depleted and secondarily b cell-deficient animals provide the best evidence that in the absence of non-self discrimination, allograft rejection does not occur. in this model, although xenografts by themselves do not provide sufficient pro-inflammatory signals to induce acute inflammation, the presence of viral replication provides the "tissue-specific trigger" that activates the immune response. according to our hypothesis, the icr is activated when chronic inflammation is switched into an acute one. a critical step in this process is the expression of ifn-γ dependent pathways probably by activated mononuclear cells; this is clearly demonstrable in most cases in which tsd has been studied in humans by the requirement for the expression of irf- <dig>  <cit> ; a transcription factor closely related to ifn-γ signaling. ifn-α and ifn-γ regulate directly or indirectly the production of cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> ligands among which the cxcl- <dig> through - <dig> chemokines , ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  appear to play a prominent role  <cit> . indeed, this expression pattern has been consistently observed in most cases in which tsd was studied in the involved tissue by transcriptional profiling  <cit>  including animal rejection models  <cit> . this study provides experimental evidence that such signatures are associated with tsd and, potentially, immune-mediate rejection independent of the presence of adaptive immunity. moreover, this model provides evidence that non-self discrimination plays at best a partial role in a host that cannot eliminate xenografts unless appropriate danger signals are provided by a pathogen  <cit> . contrary to acute allograft rejection occurring in humans  <cit> , no b lymphocyte signatures  could be observed clearly demonstrating that reconstitution of a potential b cell response could not have been responsible for the inflammatory switch and the production of cxcl and ccl chemokines  <cit> . furthermore, contrary to a similar rejection model that we presently analyzed in a syngeneic mouse system  <cit> , no involvement of t or b cell signatures participated in the rejection of gi-101a xenografts. furthermore, contrary to the syngeneic model of her-2/neu-expressing mammary tumor rejection  <cit>  where clear up-regulation of type i and type ii ifns could be documented, in this model isg expression was not directly accompanied with the over expression of ifn-α, ifn-β or ifn-γ suggesting that, as recently demonstrated in a cytomegalovirus model  <cit> , stimulation of interferon response genes could occur independently of de novo synthesis of ifns through a direct interaction of viral proteins with cellular transcription factors.

although most differences in the transcriptional pattern of human cancer cells were associated with arrested or dampened metabolism  a handful of genes were up-regulated specifically in infected gi-101a xenografts. among those, only irf- <dig> and stat- <dig> could be proven to be specifically expressed by human cells . the expression of irf- <dig> is not surprising considering the presence of replicating vacv in those cells compared with control xenografts from non-infected animals  <cit> , while the expression of stat- <dig> in the absence of over-expression of stat- <dig> contrasts with the analysis of host's transcripts in which stat- <dig> over-expression dominated . as irf- <dig> and stat- <dig> were also expressed by host cells, it could be hypothesized that transfer of vacv from cancer cells to host cells infiltrating the xenografts reproduced patterns observed in human cancer cells, while host's immune cells followed the classical up-regulation of pro-inflammatory pathways through stat- <dig>  irf- <dig> signaling  <cit> .

the over-expression of il- <dig> and the il-18-binding protein in this model is of particular interest. il- <dig>  originally called ifn-γ inducing factor, has not been previously observed by us or others as consistently associated with tsd  <cit> . it is possible, that il- <dig> over expression is a specific causative mechanism in this model as vacv particles have been described as inducers of this cytokine by direct monocyte activation through tlr signaling  <cit>  a finding that needs to be corroborated by future studies. contrary to il- <dig>  il- <dig> is the most consistently observed cytokine in association with tsd  <cit> . generally, we have observed this in association with the expression of il- <dig> and, it is of interest that, in this t cell-depleted model only this monocyte produced cytokine is present. il- <dig> is critical not only in expansion of memory cd8+ t cells in mice but also to maintain cytotoxic t cell effector functions. in fact, vacv clearance is delayed in il- <dig> -/- mice due to a rapid loss of cytolytic function  <cit>  most likely by natural killer cells  <cit> . thus, the role that il- <dig> may play in this immune-deficient model will need to be further investigated.

in practical terms, it would be important to understand why some tumors could be eliminated through viral oncolysis and/or a secondary immune rejection, while others are resistant. it appears that the degree of viral replication in vivo is a key determinant; however, it remains unclear the weight that direct viral oncolysis plays compared to immune-mediated rejection in this model. it appears that transcriptional changes associated with viral replication precede tumor destruction by a substantial amount of time and they are paralleled by the activation of immune signatures in the host, long before tissue destruction occurs. for instance, viral replication was quite active at day  <dig> in gi-101a xenografts; at the same time significant shut down of cancer cell metabolism  and simultaneous activation of immune functions could be observed at that early time point . yet, tumors continued their growth at least till day  <dig> when their growth started to plateau. ht- <dig> allowed vacv replication in vitro similarly to gi-101a, but in vivo viral replication was substantially reduced in most though not all ht- <dig> xenografts . this suggests that although the baseline biological phenotype of individual cell lines can influence viral replication, in vivo other factors may interfere with viral replication, and need to be further studied. this is suggested by the significant yet imperfect correlation between in vitro and in vivo replication data and, most importantly, by the individual variation among xenografts originated from the same cell line that can be permissive or non-permissive to viral replication in vivo . to clarify such subtleties, it will be necessary to investigate a larger panel of cell lines, and assess the growth patterns of individual xenografts. this could be achieved by the utilization of non-invasive strategies such as fine needle aspirations that allow direct linkage of the experimental results obtained by transcriptional profiling to the natural or therapy-induced history of each individual xenograft left in place  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although xenograft infection by oncolytic vacv offers a promising therapy of established cancer, it needs to be taken into account that the presence of adaptive immunity might change what is expected, perhaps inducing suppressive t cell responses that could abrogate the therapeutic effect of the virus in natural conditions.

the rejection of gi-101a tumors seems to be mediated by infiltrating leukocytes; thus, cancer cells not greatly affected by the viral infection in vitro may show resistance to in vivo oncolytic therapy. future studies utilizing a broader panel of cell lines will be necessary to evaluate whether a correlation exists between in vitro replication pattern and in vivo regression following vacv infection. alternatively, other factors related to the host response within the tumor microenvironment besides the in vitro permissiveness of cell lines may affect their in vivo permissiveness to vacv and/or their pattern of growth. indeed, the nature of the tumor microenvironment might predict the success of the vacv therapy even though the treatment outcome seems to be mainly correlated with the ability of the infected tumor cells to provide the "tissue-specific signal" to activate the immune response and attract specific leukocytes.

in summary, this study provides the first prospective validation of a universal mechanism associated with tsd. this information may lead to the identification of principles that could refine the treatment of cancer and chronic infection by immune stimulation or autoimmunity and allograft rejection through immune regulation.
