BACKGROUND
soil salinity is becoming a severe environmental stress all over the world. currently, over  <dig> million hectares of the world’s arable land are adversely affected by salinity  <cit> . the major toxic cation present in saline soils is na+, so under saline conditions, plants must minimize their cytosolic na+ concentration to withstand the stress  <cit> . three strategies have evolved to avoid the build-up of na+ in the plant shoot: the first restricts the movement of the ion from the soil into the root, the second sequesters na+ in the vacuole, and the third actively pumps na+ out of the cytoplasm into the soil . various ion transporters are involved in these processes, but a particularly prominent class is represented by the na+/h+ antiporters. so far, two types of na+/h+ antiporter nhe/nhx <dig> and nha/sos <dig> have been well characterized  <cit> .

atsos <dig> is the first plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter gene cloned from higher plant, primarily expression of atsos <dig> in epidermal cells at the root tip and in parenchyma at the xylem-symplast boundary of roots, stems and leaves, implying a role of this transporter in extruding na+ to the growth medium and controlling long-distance na+ transport in plants. furthmore, under moderate salinity, sos <dig> mutant accumulated less na+ in its shoots than wt  plants, also indicating that sos <dig> participates in loading of na+ into the xylem  <cit> . recently, several similar studies indicated this critical function in tomato  <cit>  and in thellungiella salsuginea  <cit> . sos <dig> might also be involved in k+ nutrition in plants and under salt stress it is more vital for the plant to keep a high k+/na+ ratio  <cit> . the sos <dig> mutant showed significantly reduced high affinity k+ uptake and k+ content  <cit> , while higher k+ efflux from sos <dig> root than that in wt plants  <cit> . qi and spalding  demonstrated that sos <dig> was required for protecting k+ uptake through akt <dig> and compromised k+ nutrition during salt stress  <cit> . in addition, zxsos <dig> controls long distance transport and spatial distribution of na+ and k+ and maintains na+, k+ homeostasis in the xerophyte zygophyllum xanthoxylum  <cit> . together, sos <dig> is essential for plant to cope with salt stress by maintaining ions homeostasis and controlling long-distance na+ transport via the xylem  <cit> .

the recognition of atsos <dig> has facilitated the isolation of homologs from a growing number of plant species. some of these have been tested by their heterologous expression in either yeast or bacterial hosts which lack their own na+ transport system . loss-of-function mutants of atsos <dig> is salinity hypersensitive  <cit> , while constitutive expression of sos <dig> in both a. thaliana itself as well as in other plant species, including chrysanthemum, improves the level of salinity tolerance .

the leading ornamental species chrysanthemum does not readily tolerate salinity stress, although some of its many related species do. the current level of understanding the mechanisms of salinity tolerance in this botanical group is still limited  <cit> . here, the morphological effects of salinity stress, along with the extent of na+ and k+ accumulation in chrysanthemum and its three more tolerant related species  have been explored. the sos <dig> homologs present in each of the four species has been isolated and their contribution to salinity tolerance assessed by heterologously expressing them in a yeast mutant ant <dig>  and in transgenic chrysanthemum and a. thaliana. furthermore, some important amino acid polymorphism for effective ion transport activity and salinity tolerance was also identified by mutagenesis.

RESULTS
variation for salinity tolerance in the chrysanthemum complex
most of the leaves of c. morifolium plants became wilted and chlorotic following a ten day exposure to the salinity stress, and their lower leaves were largely necrotic c. crassum plants were less severely affected by the treatment, while there was no evidence of any damage to either c. chinense or a. japonica plants, the leaves of which stayed green, with the plants maintaining a near-normal level of growth for up to 14 days . under the non-stressed growing conditions, there was no variation in tissue na+ concent between the four test species. however, when the plants were exposed to salinity, the tissue na+ content throughout the plant was increased in all four species. the mean increase was notably lower for c. chinense and a. japonica: in these two species, the na+ content in the roots  rose by only  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % respectively, while for c. crassum and c. morifolium plants, the increase was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % . the leaves behaved similarly, with the na+ content rising more markedly in c. morifolium than in others. the na+ content in the leaves of c. morifolium was  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % that present in c. crassum, c. chinense and a. japonica plants exposed to the nacl stress respectively . moreover, the na+ content in the stems behaved in a consistent way, it was highest in c. morifolium, moderate in c. crassum and low in both a. japonica and c. chinense .fig.  <dig> the phenotypic response of chrysanthemum and its three close relatives to a ten day exposure to 200 mm nacl. a-h side view; i-p vertical view from above; a-d and i-l plants grown in the absence of stress; e-h and m-p plants exposed to nacl. a, e, i, m

k+ concent in the roots of c. chinense, a. japonica and c. crassum plants show nearly unchanged between control and salt stress except that of c. morifolium plants, whose k+ contents were significantly decreased . k+ level in both a. japonica and c. chinense stems was also unchanged, on the contrary, k+ content in the stems of c. crassum and c. morifolium was distinctly reduced by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively . while k+ content in the leaves of all the plants tended to decrease, the reduction was far more significant in c. morifolium, i.e.,  <dig>  % . relative to normal condition, salinity appreciably decreased the k+/na+ ratio throughout the plants. c. chinense and a. japonica exhibited the highest k+/na+ ratio of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in comparison, c. morifolium showed a minimum value in this ratio , while c. crassum showed an intermediate ratio of  <dig>  . overall, k+/na+ ratio of the salt-sensitive plants was much lower than that of the salt-tolerant plants, indicating that salt-tolerant plants excluded na+ and imported k+ more effectively than salt-sensitive plants did.

sos <dig> transcription profiling
in the roots, the abundance of ajsos <dig> transcript increased gradually of salinity stressed plants, reaching a level of  <dig>  fold above the base level after a 24 h exposure to 200 mm nacl. cmsos <dig> expression level increased only slowly over the first four hours of the treatment, peaking by 12 h, then decreased slightly, while the transcripts of crcsos <dig> and ccsos <dig> maintained relatively constant . in the stems, all four sos1s were up-regulated by the stress, their transcripts were greatest after 12 h . in the leaves, the level of transcription of both crcsos <dig> and cmsos <dig> was highest at 24 h; that of ajsos <dig> rosed most sharply between 4 h and 12 h, thereafter declined; and that of ccsos <dig> remained relatively constant, with a two fold up-regulation occurring at 4 h . in essence, all four sos1s were up-regulated by exposure to salinity, and the abundance of sos <dig> transcript was greater in the more salinity tolerant plants.fig.  <dig> qpcr based transcription profiling of the four sos <dig> genes in response to salinity stress. relative transcript abundances in the root , stem  and leaf . the relative expression in all tissues and time points was first compared to the reference genein each species and then calculated using the expression value at the initial time  in the root of cmsos <dig>  data are presented as mean ± se . actin was used as reference gene



complementation of the yeast mutant with four sos1s
all the yeast cells grew freely on ypda in the absence of nacl and one of the four related sos1s transformed ant <dig> cells grew much better on ap nacl-containing medium than the control strain . a comparison of the ability of four sos1s transformants to grow in the presence of salt especially at 70 mm nacl showed that the inclusion of ajsos <dig> was the most beneficial, followed by that of crcsos1; the strain carrying ccsos <dig> was better than cmsos <dig>  but was worse than crcsos <dig>  while the inclusion of cmsos <dig> was the least salinity tolerant of the transformed cells . furthermore, qpcr  analysis of the sos <dig> expression levels were almost the same between yeast transformants for four sos1s . the data demonstrated that na+/h+ antiporter activity of four sos1s was essential and ajsos <dig>  crcsos <dig> and ccsos <dig> were fully able to exclude na+ when expressed in yeast.fig.  <dig> functional characterization of four sos1s in the salinity sensitive yeast mutant ant <dig>  and expression analysis of sos <dig> gene in four sos1s yeast transformants. ant <dig> were transformed with plasmid containing four sos1s , g <dig>  and ant <dig>  were transformed with the empty vector. g <dig>  cells were used as a positive control. transformants were brought to a density  <dig> x  <dig> per ml, of which 5 μl  were spotted onto ypda medium containing 0 mm nacl  and ap medium containing  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm nacl. plates were incubated at 30 °c for 2– <dig> days. e qpcr analysis of sos <dig> expression in four sos1s yeast transformants. the actin gene was employed as an internal control



overexpression of four sos1s enhances salinity tolerance in transgenic chrysanthemum and arabidopsis plants
transgenic chrysanthemum lines overexpressing four sos1s were successfully generated. qpcr analysis showed that compare with wide type , sos <dig> transcript abundance was not very high in the eight transgenic lines under control conditions but increased greatly upon 200 mm nacl treatment . when exposure to saline hydroponics, most of the apex and edge of the lower leaves of all plants showing signs of yellowing and necrotic after 1 day treatment, while after 3 days, the leaves of sm became severely necrotic and most plants died, the survival ratio of which was only 18 %. in the transgenic plants, symptoms of damage in leaves were much less evident in s <dig> and s <dig> than sm plants, but were worse than that of other transgenic plants, most of their upper leaves still remained green, and with less affected by salinity stress, which showed the transgenic plants maintained higher chlorophyll contents. the chlorophyll content is often used as index of salt tolerance in plants under salt stress, such as in arabidopsis  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> . the percentage survival of s <dig> and s <dig> plants was 33 % and 36 %, respectively, whereas that of other transgenic plants was 49 %-68 % . furthermore, each of two transgenic a. thaliana lines overexpressing four sos1s were selected for further study. for example no expression of exogenous sos <dig> was detected in a. thaliana wide type gl <dig> but in these transgenic lines m- <dig>  m- <dig>  f- <dig>  f- <dig>  d- <dig>  d- <dig> s- <dig> and s- <dig>  which showed a high expression level of sos <dig> . on 1/ <dig> ms medium containing  <dig> or 75 mm nacl, the seed germination rates, root length and fresh weight of transgenic a. thaliana wild type or sos1- <dig> lines were higher than those of the corresponding, and in the transgenic lines, the above index value in gs- <dig>  gs- <dig>  ss- <dig> and ss- <dig> were also notably lower than that of other lines . these results indicated that the differences between the sos <dig> transcription level in the transgenic lines did not very important effect in their tolerance to salinity, and over expression of four sos1s enhanced the salinity tolerance of transgenic plants and the overexpressing plants of sos1s from salt tolerant plants were more tolerant than sos1s from salt sensitive plants.fig.  <dig> salinity tolerance of wide type ‘jinba’ and transgenic chrysanthemum plants overexpressing four sos1s. a expression levels of sos <dig> in wide type ‘jinba’ and transgenic chrysanthemum lines overpressing four sos1s. sm, wide type ‘jinba’ plant; m <dig> and m <dig>  transgenic chrysanthemum lines of ajsos1; f <dig> and f <dig>  transgenic chrysanthemum lines of crcsos1; d <dig> and d <dig>  transgenic chrysanthemum lines of ccsos1; s <dig> and s <dig>  transgenic chrysanthemum lines of cmsos <dig>  b phenotypic response of saline hydroponics with 200 mm nacl for 3 days. c plant survival measured at 4 day in the presence of saline hydroponics with 200 mm nacl



site-directed mutagenesis functional analysis in yeast
the site-directed mutagenesis applied to ajsos <dig> produced a set of  <dig> residue polymorphisms and additional one site-directed mutagenesis applied to ccsos <dig> . the hypothesis was that mutations a critical residue in ajsos <dig> or ccsos <dig> would generate a loss of salinity tolerance, as assayed by the yeast complementation test. the mutated forms were introduced into ant <dig>  and the drop test was conducted on ap medium containing 70 mm nacl and 1 mm kcl. as depicted in fig.  <dig>  mutants g13e, t26s, f143i, v238l, y463h, e512g, y549h, s639l, a919t, yg927hs, g982v, a1027v, n1109k and g1127a failed to complement the growth defect of yeast cells, which suggested that these mutations couldn’t mediate na+ efflux in yeast and may be important for transport activity and salt tolerance of ajsos <dig>  the other ajsos1-mutants supported more cell growth than either empty vector transformed ant <dig> cells or those transformed with cmsos <dig>  indicating that these mutants were null mutations.fig.  <dig> the salinity tolerance of ant <dig> cells expressing altered forms of ajsos <dig>  the yeast cells were cultured overnight and a 5 μl aliquot  was spotted onto either a ypda medium containing no nacl  or an ap medium containing 70 mm nacl . plates were incubated at 30 °c for 2– <dig> days



discussion
at the phenotypic level, c. chinense and a. japonica both appeared to tolerate salinity stress rather better than either c. crassum or c. morifolium , this finding consistent with the division of  <dig> chrysanthemum-related taxa into four clusters based on their morphological response to the stress  <cit> . the primary effect of salinity stress is a disturbance of cellular ion homeostasis, followed by the ingress of toxic levels of na+ into the cytoplasm. patterns of ion accumulation have been exploited with some success as a means of discriminating between tolerant and sensitive species/cultivars  <cit> . the present data showed that exposure to 200 mm nacl induced a smaller increase in tissue na+ content and a less reduction in tissue k+ content and k+/na+ ratio in c. chinense and a. japonica than in c. crassum and c. morifolium , consistent with the ranking based on the species’ morphological response. the main conclusion was that the variation in salt tolerance displayed by the four species most likely reflected genetic variation for their ability to exclude the ingress of na+, most probably thanks to have a more selective ion transport system. similar conclusions have been drawn from the study of a range of other plant species . na+ transporters are an important class of protein employed by a. thaliana to maintain ion homeostasis during an episode of salinity stress. the activity of atsos <dig> is central to the exclusion of na+, as well as to its loading and retrieval into and out of the xylem  <cit> . the existence of an efficient sos pathway would therefore make a major contribution to the superior salinity stress tolerance of c. chinense and a. japonica.

the sos <dig> genes isolated from the four chrysanthemum and its related species all belong to the a. thaliana cpa <dig>  family  <cit> . they all harbored three conserved functional domains nhap, inhibd and s2p , a characteristic of sos <dig> encoded proteins, and thought to be critical for their functionality  <cit> . in the absence of salinity stress, the abundance of sos <dig> transcript in both the root and stem was higher in the more salinity tolerant a. japonica and c. chinense than in either c. crassum or c. morifolium, whereas in the leaf, the sos <dig> transcript abundance in the four species differed little. the sos <dig> genes were all up-regulated throughout the plant when salinity stress was imposed, inducing much higher transcript levels in the root than in either the stem or the leaf . moreover, the transcripts of reference gene actin in four tested plants after salt treatment were relatively constant . the behavior of sos <dig> genes in a range of glycophytes is quite similar  <cit> , although in other species, salinity stress has been found to significantly up-regulate sos <dig> in the leaf but not in root  <cit> . in the former case, the assumption is that the sos <dig> protein acts to remove na+ from the root cell, while in the latter, they have been suggested to function as maintainers of a low cytosolic na+ concentration in the leaf to protect photosynthesis. notably, the abundance of ajsos <dig> and crcsos <dig> transcript in salinity-stressed plants was greater than that of ccsos <dig> and cmsos <dig>  which concords with the differences in ion accumulation and salinity tolerance displayed by the four species. similarly, in a contrast between the salinity tolerant populus euphratica and the more sensitive populus popularis, the former was seen to accumulate a higher transcript abundance of genes related to na+/h+ antiporter activity  <cit> . likewise, in a comparison of four brassica spp. accessions, the more salinity tolerant entries displayed the highest level of sos <dig> transcription  <cit> , while in bread wheat ‘kharchia 65’, a cultivar known to be an efficient na+ exporter also showed high levels of sos <dig> transcription  <cit> . finally, in a. thaliana, the level of sos <dig> transcription in the root has been shown to be inversely proportional to the accumulation of na+ in the plant  <cit> . thus the evidence is very strong to support the notion that sos <dig> proteins make an important contribution to salinity tolerance in the chrysanthemum species complex.

heterologous expression in yeast has been exploited by a number of researchers aiming to functionally characterize plant sos <dig> genes . the ant3-based system effectively discriminated between the efficacy of the chrysanthemum and its related species sos1s in terms of their ability to counteract salinity stress. in particular, the assay showed that the ajsos <dig> and crcsos <dig> products were able to compensate for the yeast host’s lack of na+-pumping atpase ena1- <dig> and plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter nha <dig> activity and the sos <dig> expression levels of yeast transformants for four sos1s were almost the same . the implication is that these proteins mediate na+ efflux at the plasma membrane of yeast. since ajsos <dig>  crcsos <dig> and ccsos <dig> were much more effective than cmsos <dig>  it seems probable that these proteins are key determinants of the contrasting ionic homeostasis and levels of salinity tolerance of the four species. similar conclusions have been drawn by contrasting the effectiveness of an sos <dig> gene isolated from the salinity tolerant species thellungiella salsuginea with that of atsos <dig>  <cit> , and that of the sos <dig> genes from the two halophytes eutrema salsugineum and schrenkiella parvula  <cit> . takahashi et al.  have shown that yeast cells heterologously expressing a phanha <dig> allele  isolated from a salinity tolerant reed plants grew better than those harboring an allele  isolated from a salinity sensitive accession  <cit> .

several researchs have been shown that transgenic plants over-expression sos <dig> improved salt tolerance . in this study, we demonstrated that over expression of four sos1s also enhanced the salinity tolerance of transgenic chrysanthemum and a. thaliana wild type or sos1- <dig>  and the overexpressing plants of sos1s from salt tolerant plants were more tolerant than that from salt sensitive plants . these results were consist with the above functional analysis in the yeast mutant. to understand the reason for the different activities at sos1s, a multiple alignment of four sos1s proteins was analyzed and found that the ajsos <dig> and crcsos <dig> sequences differed from ccsos <dig> and cmsos <dig> with respect to eighteen residues, and additional one residues in which cmsos <dig> encode amino acid relative to the same ones of the other three sos1s, and of which six were located in the membrane-spanning region and the other thirteen in the hydrophilic tail .

when site-directed mutagenesis was carried out, it was found that a number of the altered polypeptides had no deleterious effect on the ability to complement the lesion in the ant <dig> cell line, showing that these residues were not determinants of the protein’s functionality. however, some of the altered polypeptides  did reduce the level of the yeast’s salinity tolerance, implying that these were essential for endowing ajsos <dig> with the capacity to compensate for the host’s defective na+-pumping atpase and plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporter activity . g13e and t26s lie at the 5′ end of tmd <dig>  f143i and v238l in the tmd <dig> and tmd <dig> respectively, while the remaining sites map to the c terminal hydropholic tail. transmembrane regions in plant nhas are thought to be important for na+ and h+ exchange. the presence of a cytoplasmic tail indicates that the transporter is probably regulated by an external signal: under either salinity or oxidative stress, the atsos <dig> cytoplasmic tail interacts with rcd <dig>  a regulator of the oxidative stress response  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the differential activity of the four sos1s reflects a dissimilar interaction between their cytoplasmic tail and a signaling protein such as rcd <dig>  some of the mutations to ajsos <dig> are likely to have induced alterations to the protein’s secondary structure , thereby potentially affecting its regulation and functionality. in a. thaliana, the salinity sensitive mutations sos1- <dig>  sos1- <dig>  sos1- <dig> and sos1- <dig> each comprise a single residue substitution in atsos <dig>  <cit> , while the substitution e1044v in the putative auto inhibitory domain of e. salsugineum essos <dig> is necessary, but not sufficient to facilitate the growth of axt3k  yeast cells cultured on a saline medium  <cit> . in triticum durum, the mutation of tdsos <dig> alleles s1126a and s1128a  have been associated with a reduced phosphorylation ability by the a. thaliana sos <dig> kinase t/dsos2Δ <dig>  thereby preventing its activation of tdsos <dig>  <cit> . furthermore the alleles atsos <dig> s1136a and s1138a both interfere with phosphorylation by sos <dig>  while the g777d variant  is not activated by sos <dig>  <cit> . further investigations will be needed to provide much more evidences for contribution of the four sos1s homologs in salt tolerance and to understand the basis of the observed variation in the activity of the ajsos <dig> alleles.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, in the four chrysanthemum and its related species, c. chinense, a. japonica and c. crassum were better tolerate than c. morifolium. they also had a superior capacity to prevent the accumulation of na+ and the reduction of k+ in planta and their level of sos <dig> transcription was higher. moreover sos <dig> sequence polymorphisms may be responsible for the higher efficacy of the ajsos <dig> encoded protein. taken together, ajsos <dig>  crcsos <dig> and ccsos <dig> might be potential genes for enhancing salinity tolerance through transgenic strategies.
