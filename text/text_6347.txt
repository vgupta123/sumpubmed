BACKGROUND
mammary tumours are the most common neoplasms that affect female dogs , constituting half of all tumours in female dogs. from these approximately half are considered malignant  <cit> . in both women and dogs, the incidence of mammary tumour increases with age, rarely occurring before  <dig> and 5 years of age, respectively  <cit>  and is hormone dependent  <cit> . canine mammary carcinomas have epidemiologic, clinical, morphologic and prognostic features similar to those of human breast cancer and therefore represent a comparative model to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis and impacts of the tumour microenvironment in both species  <cit> .

tumour-associated macrophages  are major orchestrators of the tumour microenvironment by: sustaining the proliferation of both cancer and stromal cells; facilitating angiogenesis; suppressing the anti-tumoural functions of t-lymphocytes; and enhancing the survival of cancer stem cells . it has subsequently been shown that macrophage depletion improves outcome in several cancer models  <cit>  and validates tams as potential therapeutic targets.

macrophages are immune cells found in essentially all tissues of the body, where they engulf apoptotic cells and pathogens and produce immune effector molecules. these cells are remarkably plastic and can change their functional phenotype depending on the environmental cues they receive: macrophages can increase inflammation and stimulate the immune system, and in contrast, also play an important anti-inflammatory role and decrease immune reactions through the release of cytokines. macrophages that are pro-inflammation are called m <dig> macrophages, whereas those that decrease inflammation and encourage tissue repair are called m <dig> macrophages. tams have an m <dig> phenotype and are predominately activated by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and csf- <dig> secreted by the tumour, whereas m <dig> macrophages are classically activated by lipopolysaccharide  and ifnγ and driven to phagocytosis  <cit> . recent work has highlighted the plasticity of macrophages and indicates that transition forms of m1/m <dig> macrophages coexist during tumour progression  <cit> . for example, an intermediary form of macrophages has recently been identified as regulatory macrophages, presenting elevated il- <dig> and low il- <dig> secretion  <cit> . during the m1-to-m <dig> transition of macrophages the molecular changes occurring can have profound effect on breast cancer cell behaviour; notably, the levels of the cytokines csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> are elevated during this transition  <cit> . csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> are known modulators of the fate of macrophages, both driving the production of m <dig> cells and being correlated to poor prognosis in cancer  <cit> .

our understanding of the interaction between tams and cancer cells is still evolving  <cit> , as is the very classification of m1/m <dig> macrophages  <cit> . much is still debated with regards to the origin, the variety of phenotypes, and the actual roles of macrophages within tumours. while the predominating view is that the tumour provides an environment that promotes an m <dig> phenotype, consensus is shifting towards the idea that each individual macrophage is a distinct unit that differs from its counterparts  <cit> . for example, there is evidence that while capable of inducing tumour invasion and expressing m <dig> markers, tams also retain the ability to kill cancer cells when mediated by anti-cancer antibodies  <cit> .

in this study we aim to further understand the mutual effects between cancer cells and macrophages by investigating the role of csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> stimulation on this interaction and promotion of an m <dig> phenotype within the context of canine mammary carcinoma. we found that while csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> drive the onset of m <dig> characteristics, we propose that these cytokines also mediate activation of macrophages to a state that is not fully polarized.

RESULTS
macrophage activation can be inhibited by mammary carcinoma cells
macrophages are activated by lps, a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. here, lps-induced macrophage activation was measured by increased expression of mhc ii and enhanced granularity, as demonstrated by an increase in side scatter  on flow cytometry. the enhanced side scatter may indicate accumulation of enzyme-containing granules and cellular activation  <cit> . to determine the interplay between cancer cells and macrophages, we co-cultured a macrophage cell line  with either canine mammary carcinoma cells , human mammary carcinoma cells  or non-cancerous control cells . the presence of either rem <dig> or mcf- <dig> cells significantly reduced lps-induced activation of raw macrophages as measured by both granularity ) and expression of mhc ii  and ). the presence of non-cancerous hek293t cells had only a minor effect on macrophage activation . co-culture of macrophages and rem <dig> cells was also able to inhibit the expression of m <dig> macrophage marker cd <dig> in response to lps-induced activation, contrary to what would be expected; this cell surface marker was anticipated to be increased with cancer cell-stimulation of the macrophages . these results demonstrate that both canine and human mammary cancer cells can condition macrophages into a reduced activation state in the presence of lps, characteristic of m <dig> macrophages, but independent of the m <dig> marker cd <dig> fig.  <dig> cancer cells inhibit lps induced activation of macrophages. macrophages  were co-cultured with either canine mammary carcinoma , human mammary cancer cells  or non-cancerous cells , stimulated with 1 μg/ml lps for 48 h. lps-induced activation of macrophages was measured by changes in granularity ), percentage of mhc ii+ cells ) or mean fluorescence intensity of mhc ii ), and expression of the m <dig> marker, cd <dig> . macrophages were distinguished from cancer cells in flow cytometry by csfe staining. all experiments are replicates of  <dig>  asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in relation to lps-treated cells, where p <  <dig>   by kruskal-wallis test; “ns” indicates non-significant differences



lps-induced activation of macrophages is ccr <dig> dependent
the cytokine ccl <dig> is important for macrophage recruitment and driving the m <dig> to m <dig> transition  <cit> . here, we utilised the specific small molecule inhibitor of the ccl <dig> receptor . macrophages were pre-incubated with either the inhibitor alone or the inhibitor and exogenous ccl <dig> prior to treatment with lps. we found that inhibition of ccr <dig> had dual effects: significantly inhibiting the activation of macrophages as measured by the amount of high granularity cells , and simultaneously increasing the expression of mhc ii before ) and after ) lps-stimulation. the high granularity cells were separated by facs and were confirmed not to be doublets . interestingly, the basal expression level of cd <dig> was induced by ccl <dig> but compared to control cells was unaffected by the presence of the ccr <dig> inhibitor . therefore, while mhc ii and cd <dig> expression levels indicate that ccl <dig> signalling leads to m <dig> characteristics, the cellular granularity indicates that inhibiting ccr <dig> actually can decrease this parameter of activation. overall, these results indicate that ccr <dig> signalling is important for the formation of alternatively activated macrophages, but blocking ccr <dig> also decreases the population of naturally highly granular cells within the macrophage cell line.fig.  <dig> m1/m <dig> polarization of macrophages involves ccr <dig> signalling. raw cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 10 μm rs <dig> hydrochloride, a small molecule inhibitor of ccr <dig>  prior to stimulation with 1 μg/ml lps for 48 h. an equivalent volume of dmso was used as a vehicle control. lps-induced activation of macrophages was measured by changes in the percentage of high granularity cells ) before ) and after lps-treatment ), expression of mhc ii before ) or after lps stimulation ), and expression of the m <dig> marker, cd <dig> . all experiments are replicates of  <dig>  asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in relation to the ccr2i treated cells, where p <  <dig>  by kruskal-wallis  or anova ; “ns” indicates non-significant differences



effects of mammary carcinoma cells on macrophages is csf <dig> dependent
colony stimulating factor- <dig>  is associated with m <dig> activation of macrophages in cancer  <cit> . to investigate the role of csf- <dig> in the interaction between cancer cells and macrophages, we utilised soluble recombinant canine csf- <dig> receptor  to competitively inhibit free csf- <dig>  <cit>  in co-culture experiments with raw cells and rem <dig> cells. the ability of the soluble recombinant receptor to bind csf- <dig> was determined by elisa . the presence of canine mammary carcinoma cells decreased the lps-induced activation of macrophages as determined by granularity  and expression of mhcii . this effect was rescued and enhanced by inhibition of csf- <dig>  whereby lps-induced activation of macrophages – as determined by granularity  and expression of mhcii  – was elevated  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold respectively. this implies that cancer cell mediated effects on macrophages are at least partially dependent on csf- <dig> fig.  <dig> cancer cell effects on macrophages are csf- <dig> dependent. canine recombinant csf-1r binds to csf- <dig> as detected by elisa. bsa was used as a control protein for coating the plate . rem <dig> cells, raw cells and soluble canine recombinant csf1r  were co-cultured for 3 days prior to lps-induced activation of macrophages. activation of macrophages was measured by granularity  and expression of mhc ii . all experiments are replicates of  <dig>  asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in relation to the lps treated cells, where p <  <dig>  by anova; “ns” indicates non-significant differences



effects of macrophages on mammary carcinoma cells involves csf <dig> and ccl2
we have shown that ccl <dig> is required for driving lps-induced activation of macrophages, and that csf- <dig>  secreted from cancer cells, induces polarisation of macrophages. we next assessed the effect of these cytokines on canine cancer cells. both macrophages ) and rem <dig> ) cells were incubated independently with increasing concentrations of csf- <dig>  and showed a dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation. interestingly, rem <dig> cells incubated with increasing doses of ccl <dig> showed marginal effects on cell proliferation –  <dig> -fold increase in proliferation at the highest doses used – which was not dose-dependent at the stated doses ). as an alternative method to assess the effect of ccl <dig> on rem <dig> cells, we cultured macrophages with increasing doses of ccl <dig> and then harvested the media, termed macrophage conditioned media. this was subsequently used to treat rem <dig> cells, and induced a ccl <dig> dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation ). this data suggests that cancer cell proliferation can be stimulated in a dose-dependent manner directly by csf- <dig> and indirectly via ccl <dig>  furthermore, addition of macrophage conditioned media to mammary cancer cells seemed to induce the expression of the receptors required for the signalling of csf- <dig>  ) and ccl <dig>  ).fig.  <dig> csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> contribute to cancer cell proliferation and activity. macrophages ) and rem <dig> ) cells were incubated with increasing doses of csf- <dig>  cellular proliferation was measured after 48 h. pbs +  <dig>  % bsa was used a vehicle control at 0 ng/ml. rem <dig> cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ccl <dig> ) or conditioned media  from ccl <dig> treated macrophages ). cellular proliferation was measured after 48 h. pbs +  <dig>  % bsa was used a vehicle control at 0 ng/ml. experiments are replicates of  <dig>  statistical analysis considered each group against the control group. expression of csf-1r was assayed in lilly cancer cells, after exposure to macrophage conditioned media, by immunofluorescence ). expression of ccr <dig> was measured in rem <dig> cells, after exposure to macrophage-conditioned media, by qrt-pcr ). cellular activity was measured by glucose uptake. rem <dig> cells were pre-incubated with macrophage-conditioned media for 72 h prior to analysis. ethanol was used as a vehicle control . cells were incubated at 4 °c as a negative control . figures b and c are replicates of  <dig>  statistical analysis considered each group against the rem group. asterisks or horizontal bars indicate statistically significant differences to the 0 ng/ml or rem group, where p <  <dig>  by kruskal-wallis  or mann–whitney ; “ns” indicates non-significant differences



we also analysed the cellular activity of rem <dig> cells after treatment with macrophage-conditioned media by assaying for glucose uptake. here rem <dig> cells treated with macrophage-conditioned media showed a higher level of glucose uptake compared to untreated cells . glucose uptake of rem <dig> cells was also measured at 4 °c as a negative control and with the addition of ethanol as a vehicle control . these results indicate that cancer cells respond to factors secreted by macrophages by upregulating: expression of key signalling receptors; cellular proliferation; and cellular activity.

proliferation of canine mammary carcinoma cell lines is dependent on csf-1r
to determine the effect of inhibition of csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> signalling on cancer cells we utilised the small molecule inhibitors of csf-1r  and ccr <dig> . as a control we used the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, toceranib. toceranib  inhibits phosphorylation of c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase and cell proliferation of rem <dig> cells in a dose dependent manner . here we show that rem <dig> cell proliferation is inhibited in a dose dependent manner by inhibition of ccr <dig> ), ckit ), and csf-1r ). to determine if these effects are consistent in canine mammary carcinoma cell lines, we utilised the inflammatory mammary carcinoma cell line, lilly . lilly cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in proliferation when treated with gw <dig> ), but not with the inhibitor of ccr <dig> ), or toceranib ), highlighting cell line dependent responses to treatment. however these results show that the proliferation potential of both canine mammary carcinoma cell lines tested are dependent on csf-1r signalling.fig.  <dig> proliferation of canine mammary carcinoma cells is csf-1r dependent. canine mammary carcinoma cell lines, rem <dig> and lilly were treated with increasing doses of either ccr <dig> small-molecule inhibitor , toceranib , or csf-1r inhibitor   for 48 h before assaying for cell viability. all experiments are replicates of  <dig>  asterisks indicate statistically significant differences to the dmso group, where p <  <dig>  by anova



dual role of csf- <dig> in stimulation of macrophages
csf- <dig> is an important mediator of the interaction between macrophages and cancer cells. here we investigate the effect of recombinant csf- <dig> on macrophages. macrophages were grown in media containing increasing amounts of recombinant csf- <dig> for 48 h and then analysed for expression of the m <dig> marker, mhc ii. basal mhc ii expression levels increased in a dose dependent manner in response to recombinant csf- <dig> ). in contrast, exposing macrophages to media containing increasing concentrations of ccl <dig> had no significant effect on basal mhc ii levels ). to understand the effect of csf- <dig> in driving pro or anti-inflammatory properties, we studied two markers of these characteristics by western blot. exposure of macrophages to recombinant csf- <dig> increased the expression of the inflammation marker, cox- <dig> and decreased expression of the anti-inflammatory marker, twist- <dig> , indicating that csf- <dig> conditioning of macrophages leads to an inflammatory phenotype.fig.  <dig> the dual role of csf- <dig> in macrophage activation. macrophages were incubated with media containing increasing concentrations of either recombinant csf- <dig> ) or recombinant ccl <dig> ) for 2 days prior to analysis of mhc ii expression by flow cytometry. protein expression levels of cox- <dig> and twist were determined by western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. 20 μg protein loaded . macrophages were incubated with media containing increasing concentrations of either recombinant csf- <dig> ) or recombinant ccl <dig> ) for 2 days prior lps-induced activation . mhc ii expression levels were determined by flow cytometry. figures  are replicates of  <dig>  figures  are replicates of  <dig>  asterisks indicate statistically significant differences to the raw or raw + lps group, where p <  <dig>  by kruskal-wallis  and c) or anova, unless where indicated; “ns” indicates non-significant differences



lps-induced activation of macrophages in the indicated media showed that both csf- <dig> ), and ccl <dig> ) mediate a dose-dependent decrease in mhc ii levels in response to lps activation, indicating that csf- <dig> plays a dual role in macrophage activation.

reduced expression of twist- <dig> mimics the effect of csf- <dig> stimulation
to determine if the effect of csf- <dig> on macrophages is mediated via the transcription factor twist- <dig>  we reduced the levels of twist- <dig> protein in macrophages using sirna to twist- <dig> . this resulted in a significant increase in basal mhc ii levels compared to mock transfected cells ). however lps-activation of macrophages showed no change in mhc ii levels and this was unaffected by twist- <dig> expression levels. granularity was again used as a measure of macrophage activation. reduction of twist- <dig> levels increased basal granularity marginally but with statistical significance, and significantly decreased lps-induced activation of macrophages ).as a measure of cellular function we assayed the effect of twist- <dig> knock down on phagocytosis, and identified a similar pattern to granularity. reduction of twist- <dig> levels slightly increased basal levels of phagocytosis compared to control, but upon activation of macrophages by lps there was significantly decreased phagocytosis . these results indicate that reduction in twist- <dig> levels mimics the effects of treating macrophages with recombinant csf- <dig> and suggests that csf- <dig> acts upstream of twist- <dig> to mediate macrophage polarisation.fig.  <dig> csf- <dig> and twist- <dig> are key mediators of macrophage activation. twist- <dig> protein levels were depleted by treating with sirna against twist- <dig> for 24 h. immunofluorescence was carried out using anti-twist- <dig> antibody . the effects of the reduction of twist- <dig> levels on lps-induced activation of macrophages were assayed by expression of mhc ii ); granularity ); and phagocytosis . all experiments are replicates of  <dig>  horizontal bars indicate statistically significant differences on a student t-test, where p <  <dig> , unless where indicated; “ns” indicates non-significant differences



discussion
distinct macrophage subsets have been linked with either protective or pathogenic roles in cancer. a protective role has been described for m <dig> macrophages, which activate tumour-killing mechanisms and antagonise the suppressive activity of tams. in contrast, tams suppress adaptive tumour-specific immune responses and promote tumour growth, invasion, metastasis, stroma remodelling and angiogenesis. tams have a suppressive m2-like phenotype. accumulating evidence from many tumour models suggests that macrophages contribute to tumour progression, with increasing numbers of tams correlating with poor outcomes. here we investigated the interplay between canine mammary carcinoma cells and macrophages. we have shown that cancer cells and macrophages have mutual effects on each other, and that the cytokines csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> are important mediators of this interaction. furthermore, we have identified that csf- <dig> is likely to signal via the transcription factor twist- <dig> to exert its effects on macrophage activation.

our data corroborates previous studies. wasserman et al.  demonstrated the capacity of several canine cancer cells to inhibit macrophage mhc ii expression, therefore driving tams into the alternative m2-activation pathway  <cit> . król et al.   <cit>  showed that lps-induced activation of macrophages was inhibited by co-culturing macrophages with canine mammary cancer cells. here we utilised canine mammary carcinoma cells and showed by cellular granularity and mhc ii expression of macrophages that rem <dig> cells can inhibit lps-induced activation of macrophages.

there is currently controversy regarding the dogma of classic and alternative macrophage activation, termed m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively. as research into macrophage biology has evolved, so has the growing amount of information regarding recognition receptors, cytokines, and the signalling and genetic programs behind them that control an increasing number of functions of macrophages. therefore there is a need to recognise a broader functional repertoire of macrophages that may not fit into the distinct m <dig> and m <dig> classifications  <cit> . furthermore, tumour microenvironments, compared to a healthy tissue, are haphazard and may contain areas of hypoxia, higher lactate, extracellular acidosis and glucose starvation  <cit> . within a tumour multiple and different m <dig> and m <dig> stimuli may act on macrophages, and in this context, macrophages may not form distinct activation subsets nor clonally expand, leading to a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes. as a marker of m2-activation we used cd <dig>  in contrast to the granularity and mhc ii expression data, expression of cd <dig> increased after lps-activation but was unaffected by the presence of cancer cells, indicating that, in these culture conditions, macrophages under the influence of cancer cells are in an activation state between the extremes of the m <dig> or m <dig> spectrum.

csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> have well-characterised roles in macrophage activation including inducing macrophage survival and recruitment  <cit> . expression of both csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> have been independently correlated with cancer progression in several tumour types  <cit> . our studies show that blocking the receptor of ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  with a small molecule inhibitor could increase macrophage activation, and this supports previous studies where raw <dig>  macrophages are able to produce this cytokine  <cit>  and, by blocking this autocrine signalling, induce cellular activation. this may be mediated through activin a, which can simultaneously alter the expression of ccr <dig> and ccl <dig> in macrophages, depending on their previous activation state  <cit> . blocking ccr <dig> signalling is expected to induce the expression of activin a, which is known to drive mhc ii expression in macrophages, as well as phagocytosis and other m <dig> characteristics  <cit> . we showed that in the presence of lps the effects of blocking ccr <dig> were more pronounced. here, blocking ccr <dig> in macrophages allowed for a marked increase in cellular activation. the addition of rhccl <dig> could not reverse this effect, demonstrating that blockade of the receptor was complete. interestingly, it has been shown that lps treatment alone can induce ccl <dig> expression in raw <dig>  macrophages as a negative feedback, since its expression is controlled by stat- <dig>  an immune regulator  <cit> . the effect of ccl <dig> on macrophages was confirmed by cd <dig> expression. adding recombinant ccl <dig> increased expression of this marker. overall, the results with ccl <dig> indicate a shift towards an m <dig> activation phenotype in the presence of ccl2/ccr <dig> signalling. another work found that co-culture of macrophages and canine cancer cells reduced the relative expression of ccl <dig> by the macrophages, but at the same time induced its expression by cancer cells  <cit> , therefore supporting the hypothesis that macrophages will be directed towards an m <dig> phenotype in the presence of cancer cells. however, ccr <dig> blockade also had the opposite effect of reducing the percentage of highly-granular macrophages. these highly-granular cells represent only a small fraction of the total macrophage population, but are likely to represent an activated subset of the cellular population  <cit> . therefore, the reduction in the highly-granular subgroup of macrophages in the absence of ccr <dig> signalling points away from the more accepted role of ccr <dig> inducing m <dig> polarization of tams.

as with ccl <dig>  csf- <dig> had a negative impact on lps-induced macrophage activation. while adding recombinant csf- <dig> reduced macrophage expression of mhc ii following lps activation, blocking it with a soluble recombinant csf-1r allowed a marked activation of these cells. this indicates that by blocking csf-1r signalling, an inflammatory phenotype can be obtained, even in the presence of cancer cells.

both macrophages and canine mammary cancer cells are able to proliferate in the presence of rhcsf- <dig>  while ccl <dig> itself induces some cancer cell proliferation, ccl <dig> conditioning of the macrophages increases the effect that these cells have on cancer cell proliferation. macrophage conditioned media is also capable of inducing expression of csf-1r and ccr <dig> by mammary carcinoma cells, indicating that there is a cycle whereby cancer cells induce macrophage proliferation and phenotypic change, and the presence of macrophages leads to cancer cell growth, with both processes occurring, at least partially, through csf-1r/ccr <dig> signalling . csf-1r expressed by cancer cells does not have any mutations compared to the native receptor , indicating that it must depend on either autocrine or paracrine signalling to support cancer expansion. csf-1r has been associated with mammary cancer aggressiveness in dogs  <cit> , and the expression of the receptor has been shown to be increased in canine mammary adenocarcinoma cells in co-cultures with macrophages  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the molecular interactions following macrophage and cancer cell activation. arrows indicate that the pathway is increased; blunt-ended lines represent a negative effect on another receptor/pathway



the effect of macrophage conditioned media on the cancer cells is biologically relevant since it increases cancer cell metabolism, as measured by cellular glucose uptake and cellular proliferation. increased expression of ccl <dig> can induce insulin resistance  <cit> , which is usually associated with hyperinsulinemia  <cit>  and increased glucose uptake by cancer cells. lactic acid production by tumour cells, generated as a consequence of glucose metabolism, has been shown to be central for the signalling that induces m2-macrophages  and vascular endothelial growth factor expression  <cit> . therefore, when in contact with macrophages, cancer cells will consume more glucose, thereby reinforcing an m <dig> phenotypic state on the macrophages.

csf-1r signalling is relevant both for macrophages and cancer cells. however the role of ccl <dig> produced by the cancer cells, as described previously  <cit> , appears to be confined to altering the macrophage phenotype, as cancer cells themselves were unaffected by inhibition of ccr <dig>  the proliferative response of cancer cells to ccl2-treated macrophage cm is probably due to activation of other receptors in the cancer cells by soluble factors secreted from macrophages. this highlights the complexity of the tumour microenvironment and the importance of the secretome in the interplay between cancer cells and tams.

twist- <dig> is a transcription factor that has been associated with macrophage activation and function and in the interaction between tyrosine kinase receptors  and toll-like receptors   <cit> . to assess the importance of twist- <dig> signalling in the m1-to-m <dig> transition, expression of twist- <dig> was depleted in macrophages. a decrease in twist- <dig> protein levels lead to increased macrophage activation, as measured by phagocytosis capacity, cell granularity and mhc ii expression. however, when lps was added, twist- <dig> knock down only partially impeded macrophage activation by lps. therefore, depletion of twist- <dig> had similar effects to treating macrophages with recombinant csf- <dig>  indicating that csf- <dig> may signal through twist- <dig> to mediate the m1-to-m <dig> transition.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we have characterised the interplay between cancer cells and macrophages. we have shown that there is a cycle mediated by the cytokines csf- <dig> and ccl <dig>  whereby cancer cells induce macrophage proliferation and phenotypic changes, and macrophages stimulate cancer cell proliferation. we have also highlighted the importance of the transcription factor twist- <dig> in macrophage activation and that cancer-related changes in glucose metabolism reinforce the m <dig> phenotypic state of macrophages. the tumour microenvironment is highly complex and we have shown dual roles for the cytokine, csf- <dig> and ccl <dig> in the context of macrophage activation, suggesting a spectrum of macrophage activation states. future single-cell analysis of tumours will provide further insight into the complexity of macrophage activation, which will have ramifications for both veterinary and human cancer treatment programs.
