BACKGROUND
as its name implies, plant lipid transfer protein  were termed because of their functions that transfer phospholipids and fatty acids between membranes in vitro  <cit> . they were also named non-specific ltps  due to the character of non-specific binding to different lipids. plant nsltps are small, basic proteins, usually about  <dig>  ~  <dig>  kda in size, characterized by an eight cysteine motif  backbone with the general form c-xn-c-xn-cc-cxc-xn-c-xn-c  <cit> . almost all nsltps carry an n-terminal signal peptide in their nascent polypeptides. thus, these proteins are likely secreted to the cell exterior for functioning. many nsltps also possess a sequence for the post-translational addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchor, which attaches the protein to the exterior side of the plasma membrane  <cit> . the conserved features of plant nsltps include four defined disulfide bonds formed by eight cys residues. furthermore, the crystal structures of plant nltps were comprised of four or five alpha helices , with a central hydrophobic cavity where the lipid binding takes place  <cit> .

based on the molecular weight  of the mature proteins, plant nsltps can be classified into two main types, nsltp <dig>  and nsltp <dig>   <cit> . according to the sequence similarity, boutrot et al. classified  <dig> out of the  <dig> rice nsltps and  <dig> out of the  <dig> arabidopsis nsltps into nine types   <cit> . recently, nsltps have been categorized into four major and several minor types by sequence similarity, intron position and spacing between the cysteine residues, as well as a potential glycophosphatidylinositol modification site within their encoded proteins  <cit> . in vitro studies showed that plant nsltps have the ability to facilitate the inter-membrane exchange and transfer of various amphiphilic molecules including phospholipids, glycolipids, steroids, acyl-coas and fatty acids. several structures of plant nsltps have been resolved by x-ray and nmr spectroscopic techniques  <cit> . the typical fold of nsltp <dig> is characterized by four to five α-helices connected by four disulfide bridges, partly wrapped by a long c-terminal segment. the overall structure delimits a large central hydrophobic cavity, where the alkyl moiety of lipids is inserted into. the backbone folds of nsltp <dig> and nsltp <dig> show structural similarities, however, drastic changes in their central hydrophobic cavity. compared with these two earliest nsltp types, the three-dimensional model of arabidopsis dir <dig>  follows the general nsltps fold with five α-helices stabilized by four disulfide bonds around a central tunnel-shaped cavity. it was reported that most of the putative functions of nsltps are related to their ability to bind lipids in their hydrophobic cavity .

in the ensuing years, some members of nsltps have been functionally identified in plant species, including the involvement of cuticular waxes and cutin syntheses  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that ltpg <dig>  a type g nsltp from arabidopsis, contribute either directly or indirectly to cuticular lipid accumulation  <cit> . in addition, nsltps are expressed in diverse organs and cells, including callus, germinating and maturing seeds, leaves, roots, stems, ovaries, anthers, and pollens  <cit> . the localization of nsltp transcripts in anthers has been well reported in arabidopsis and rice, and abundant type iii nsltps  were expressed specifically in the anther tapetum, with levels peaking at the developmental stage of maximal pollen-wall exine synthesis  <cit> . a lipid transfer protein, osc <dig>  is widely distributed in anther tissues such as the tapetal cytoplasm, required for postmeiotic anther development in rice  <cit> . with respect to plant defense, nsltps are also recognized to be pathogenesis-related proteins and constitute the pr- <dig> family  <cit> . some of them were demonstrated to share structural similarities with oomycetous elicitins and act as competitors with elicitins for specific receptors on membrane  <cit> . in addition, nsltps participate in long-distance signaling during pathogen defense  <cit> . studies on purified nsltps confirmed their roles in abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . transcript levels of nsltps increased in response to drought, salt and cold stresses in many cases  <cit> . stabilization of membranes, cuticle deposition and/or changes in cell wall organization have been claimed as their putative roles in the responses to these stress factors. in tobacco, nsltp genes up-regulated during drought-induced cuticular wax deposition  <cit> . overexpression of the pepper caltp <dig> gene in arabidopsis increased its tolerance to nacl and drought stresses at various vegetative growth stages  <cit> . arabidopsis ltp <dig> act as a target of myb <dig> to be involved in plant tolerance to freezing and drought stresses  <cit> .

in previous studies, only a small portion of nsltps from maize have been well characterized. these include, mzm3- <dig>  which is expressed specifically in the tapetum during male gametogenesis  <cit> ; zm-ltp , which binds to calmodulin  in a ca2+-independent manner  <cit> ; zmltp <dig> , which is induced by mannitol, salt and sa treatments  <cit> ; betl- <dig> , which is transcribed in the outer surface of the developing endosperm  <cit> . as the genome of inbred line b <dig> has been sequenced completely, it is the time to initiate functional annotation and to perform more comprehensive analysises of maize nsltp gene family. to date, genome-wide overview of the maize nsltp gene family was yet to be reported. therefore, as the first step to elucidate the functions of zmltps, a genome-wide study for this gene family is necessary. in this study, we identified  <dig> genes encoding  <dig> putative nsltps in the maize genome that can be classified into five types. detailed analyses including primary sequence, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure, chromosome location, gene duplication and divergence, three-dimensional structure, gene ontology, promoter and expression profilings were performed. based on microarray, rna-sequencing and real-time quantitative pcr , we analyzed the expression patterns of zmltp genes in different tissues and developmental stages, and took a further step towards understanding plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. our analysis provides novel insights on zmltp gene family to support further functional research on nsltp gene family in plants, particularly the proteins that may have important functions in response to biotic and abiotic stresses.

RESULTS
identification of nsltp members in maize and sorghum
in order to identify the complete and non-redundant nsltps in maize, an accurate scan of the maize proteome was performed. initially,  <dig> potential zmltps were identified in the maize genome following the removal of those sequences with an incomplete 8cm domain. then, each of the deduced protein sequences was manually assessed through the analysis of the cysteine residue patterns. subsequently,  <dig> proline-rich or hybrid proline-rich proteins, which were characterized by a high proportion of proline, histidine and glycine residues in the sequence comprised between the signal peptide and the 8cm, were removed . next, two α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors, three prolamin storage proteins and three 2s albumin storage proteins were also discarded. additionally, five transcript forms lacking the gpi-anchor signal peptide  were not taken into consideration. as a result,  <dig> proteins were confirmed as maize nsltps which were encoded by  <dig> nsltp genes . additionally, the same approach was used to identify nsltps in sorghum, which resulted in the identification of  <dig> nsltp genes .

sequence analysis and classification of putative maize nsltps
previously, edstam et al. have proposed that the plant nsltps can be divided into four major and several minor types according to sequence similarity, intron position and spacing between the cysteine residues  <cit> . in one of the major types, type g, the transcripts encode a c-terminal signal sequence in addition to the n-terminal one, leading to a post-translational modification where a gpi-anchor is added to the protein. the classification of the identified type g zmltps was based on the presence of a gpi modification site, as well.. in the second round of classification, the remaining sequences were grouped according to the identity matrix calculated from the multiple sequence alignments. when compared with the classification proposed by edstam et al., we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> zmltps could be classified into five types . among the nsltps that were present in four flowering plants , the variation in the number of nsltps across types and species was detected . in type g,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nsltps were found in maize, sorghum, rice and arabidopsis, respectively. whereas, only  <dig> nsltp genes were distributed to type e in arabidopsis. noticeably, a similar number of nsltp genes were found in type  <dig> and type  <dig>  it is thus conceivable that this difference may be due to gene duplication and loss. the main characteristic of plant nsltps is the presence of eight cysteine residues in a highly conserved region . in order to establish a specific 8cm consensus for each obtained nsltp type, we conducted a multiple sequence alignment using the 8cms from the  <dig> zmltps . the amino acid sequence alignment of the 8cms of zmltps reveals a variable number of inter-cysteine amino acid residues .table  <dig>

character “x” represents any amino acid, and the arabic numeral following “x” stands for the numbers of amino acid esidues.



in this study, all the characteristics of the  <dig> zmltps were summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig>  96% of the nsltp precursors were initially synthesized with a signal peptide of 16- <dig> amino acids. the putative subcellular targeting of the  <dig> zmltp pre-protein sequences was analyzed. as expected, most of the proteins are predicted to be secreted except for zmltpg <dig>  which have been predicted to be cytoplasm protein . at the pre-protein level, the zmltpd <dig> and zmltpd <dig> deduced proteins are identical, as are the zmltpd <dig> and zmltpd <dig> deduced proteins. after cleavage of their signal peptide, the zmltpg <dig>  and zmltpg <dig>  mature proteins are identical. therefore, before potential post-translational modifications, the  <dig> zmltp genes encode  <dig> different mature proteins.  <dig> zmltps were found to have one or more phosphorylation sites and most of the phosphorylated sites were located on serine residues at the c-terminal . to clearly understand the sequence characteristics of zmltps, we further analyzed the pi  values, mw values, and cxc motifs of all available zmltps. as shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  maize nsltps are small and their molecular masses usually range from  <dig>  da to  <dig>  da except for type g. type  <dig> and type d nsltps were mostly 9 kda proteins and type  <dig> and type c nsltps were 7 kda proteins. the mw value of type g nsltps was much higher than that of other types due to the presence of supernumerary amino acid residues located at the c-terminal of the deduced mature proteins. judging from the pi value, type  <dig>   <dig>  c and d nsltps are mostly alkaline proteins. the majority of type g nsltps are weakly alkaline or acidic . the average molecular mass and the theoretical pi are  <dig>  da and  <dig>  pi, respectively. as for the cxc motif, most residues at the x position in type  <dig> nsltps are hydrophilic, while in type  <dig>  c, d and g, the x position is usually occupied by a hydrophobic residue . these conserved hydrophobic or hydrophilic residues may play significant roles in the biological functions of zmltps  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of the maize, sorghum, rice and arabidopsis nsltps
to analyze the phylogenetic relationship of the nsltps among maize, sorghum, rice and arabidopsis,  <dig> nsltps from these four species were analyzed . we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the 8cm domain sequences from maize, sorghum, rice and arabidopsis and then generated a phylogenetic tree by the neighbor-joining method. previously, edstam et al. has divided the plant nsltps into ten types  <cit> . on the basis of the comparison between the previous dataset and ours, the six groups classified here were in agreement with the type  <dig>   <dig>  c, d, e and g of nsltps. as shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  members in type  <dig> and  <dig> formed specific clades, indicating that the genes in these major nsltp types share a common ancestor. the sequences from the minor type c and e also formed separated clades. since relatively high bootstrap values were observed in the internal branches of type  <dig> and type c, it clearly showed the derivation of statistically reliable pairs of possible homologous proteins sharing similar origin from a common ancestor. it was also worth noting that type e nsltps seem to be monophyletic, and this may mean that the monocotyledon plants discarded these genes during the evolutionary divergence between monocots and dicots.

intron-exon structure of the maize nsltp gene family
as a kind of evolutionary relic, the intron-exon arrangement carries the imprint of the evolution of a gene family. investigation of zmltp gene structures revealed low diverse distribution of intronic regions amid the exonic sequences, and  <dig> zmltp genes  were predicted to be interrupted by 1- <dig> introns positioned  <dig> to 67 bp downstream of the codon encoding the eighth cysteine in the 8cm . alternative splicing forms of the same gene usually had similar intron–exon structures, indicating that the distinct proteins from a single transcript may share similar functions. additionally, it is interesting to find a similar exon/intron pattern in each group. for instance, the nsltp genes in type  <dig>   <dig> and c lacked an intron, while all members in type g contained 1- <dig> introns. except for zmltpd <dig>  zmltpd <dig>  zmltpd <dig> and zmltpd <dig>  no intron was detected in the coding regions of type d genes. our comparative analysis with the gene structures of atltps and osltps indicated that the exon/intron structures of zmltps are similar to those of arabidopsis and rice .

chromosomal localization and gene duplication of zmltp genes
in silico mapping of the gene loci showed that  <dig> zmltps were unevenly assigned to maize ten chromosomes . chromosome  <dig> contained the maximum number of zmltps , while the minimum number  were presented on chromosome  <dig>  however, several chromosomes lacked zmltps in some regions, such as the long arm of chromosome  <dig> as well as the short arms of chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the exact position  of each nsltp on maize chromosome is given in additional file 2: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

gene duplication is generally believed to be a major driving force in evolutionary innovation, giving rise to genomic complexity. maize originated from an ancient allotetraploid and has undergone several rounds of whole-genome duplication events during its gene evolution  <cit> . segmental and tandem duplications are known to be the main causes leading to gene family expansions. in this study, a total of seven tandem repeats  were identified in the maize genome. one significant cluster of three type g genes was found on chromosome  <dig>  what’s more, six direct repeat tandems were identified on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  genes in the same cluster were closely related to one another. for instance, zmltpd <dig> and zmltpd <dig> protein sequences shared 95% similarity and the two genes were physically located next to each other in the same chromosomal region. in addition, five sister pairs  appeared to be generated from segmental duplication events due to their positions on the same duplicated gene blocks . furthermore, we analyzed the evolution of nsltp genes among maize, sorghum and rice .  <dig> out of  <dig> maize nsltp genes had collinear genes in rice, while  <dig> had syntenic members in sorghum. according to this analysis, two paired nsltp genes  were located in genomic regions with synteny between the maize and rice genomes. seven paired nsltp genes  were located in genomic regions with synteny between the maize and sorghum genomes, indicating that these genes may be derived from a common ancestor. interestingly, one of the sister pairs  had a unique, syntenic nsltps in sorghum, which indicated that they might be generated from segmental duplication after the divergence of maize and sorghum.

divergence rate of the maize nsltp genes
the ratio  of nonsynonymous substitution rate  versus synonymous substitution rate  is widely used as an indicator of selective pressure  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the ka/ks ratios of  <dig> duplicated gene pairs were less than  <dig>  indicating that they seemed to be under purifying selection; however, the ka/ks ratios of  <dig> duplicated gene pairs were more than  <dig>  suggesting that they subjected to positive selection. positive selection was thought to be one of the major forces for the emergency of new motifs/functions in protein after gene duplication, and the divergence of the duplicated genes was driven by positive selection  <cit> . based on the substitution rates analysis, we found that  <dig> % of the duplicated gene pairs had strong positive selection pressure, implying that positive selection contributed to further gene diversification in the zmltp family. in addition, the divergent times between the duplicated gene pairs were analyzed . the duplication events for the  <dig> segmental duplications were estimated to have occurred approximately between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago , while the duplication events for the  <dig> tandem duplications occurred approximately between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya. fossil data along with the phylogenetic studies estimated that the different grass families diverged from a common ancestor  <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit> . the divergence times on the nodes of the tree were estimated with the non-parametric rate smoothing method of sanderson, assuming that maize and rice diverged  <dig> mya  <cit> . duplication events for one tandem duplicated gene pair  occurred around  <dig>  mya, after origin of grasses and before divergence of rice and maize . the ancestor of maize and sorghum diverged about  <dig> mya and subsequently a whole genome triplication  event occurred in the maize approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . duplication events for  <dig> gene pairs  occurred within last  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years, after divergence of rice and maize, but before maize and sorghum were separated from each other. duplication events for the other two gene pairs  occurred around last  <dig> million years, after maize and sorghum were separated, and before a whole genome duplication  event occurred in the maize. therefore, evolutionary origin of the maize nsltp genes might undertake three evolutionary stages.table  <dig>

the features of the three-dimensional structures of major nsltps
in order to better understand the non-specific binding between the hydrophobic ligands and zmltps, zmltp <dig> , zmltp <dig>  and zmltpd <dig> were selected as representative sequences of type  <dig>   <dig>  and d for structural modeling . the crystal structures of maize zmltp <dig>    <cit> , wheat nsltp <dig>   <cit> , atdir <dig>   <cit>  were selected as templates for structural modeling based on searches against the pdb using the basic local alignment search tool  at ncbi  with the target type  <dig>   <dig> and d protein sequences as baits.

based on the zmltp <dig> , nsltp <dig> and atdir <dig> structures, the amino acids 29- <dig> of zmltp <dig> , 32- <dig> of zmltp <dig> , and 37- <dig> of zmltpd <dig> could be modeled with the sequence identities of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. our structural analysis showed that zmltp <dig>  and zmltp <dig>  have typical features of plant nsltps, including two conserved pentapeptides, t-t/a-a-d-r  and p-y-t-i-s . it has been reported that these two consensus pentapeptides  were important in catalysis or binding  <cit> . zmltpd <dig> and atdir <dig> contain high proline content  that is not highlighted in nsltp <dig> and zmltp <dig> . it is noteworthy that proline-rich regions are involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . as aforementioned, x is a hydrophilic residue in the cxc motif of type  <dig> nsltps. however, a hydrophobic residue was found at the x position in type  <dig> and type d nsltps. as illustrated in figure 2a, in the cxc motif, asparagines between the two cysteines in zmltp <dig>  and zmltp <dig>  are replaced by a hydrophobic amino acid, phenylalanine, in zmltp <dig>  and nsltp <dig>  whereas in zmltpd <dig> and atdir <dig>  the x position are occupied by a hydrophobic residue, leucine. the hydrophobic residues in the cxc motif of zmltp <dig> , nsltp <dig>  zmltpd <dig> and atdir <dig> are buried inside the molecule, whereas the hydrophilic residue of zmltp <dig>  and zmltp <dig>  are at the surface . in the template protein zmltp <dig> , the cys residues 1- <dig>  2- <dig>  4- <dig>  and 5- <dig> are paired, whereas the cys residues 1- <dig>  2- <dig>  4- <dig>  and 6- <dig> are paired in the template protein atdir <dig>  similarly to the type  <dig> nsltps. these observations suggested that the central residue of the cxc motif may govern the cysteine pairing and influence the overall fold of the protein. the crystal structure homology models were validated in terms of stereochemical quality by ramachandran plot and the errat prediction .figure  <dig>

from the superposition structure, we find that zmltp <dig>  and zmltp <dig>  share a common structural fold stabilized by four disulfide bonds, and the four prominent α-helices are packed against a flexible c-terminal arm formed by a series of turns, which forms a cap over the hydrophobic cavity . the three-dimensional structure of zmltp <dig>  showed that two adjacent hydrophobic cavities seem able to expand the hydrophobic cavity to accommodate the alkyl ligand . the structure of zmltpd <dig> is in accordance with atdir in the aspects of the order and orientation. their α-helix topology is well conserved and the four cysteine bridges superimpose well, showing high similarity in the three-dimensional structure . interestingly, the arabidopsis mutant defective  was compromised in the production or transmission of an essential mobile signal to promote long-distance signaling  <cit> . whether other type d nsltps have the functions related to systemic resistance signalling remain to be further investigated.

gene ontology analysis of the maize nsltps
in order to comprehend the unique aspects of maize nsltps, gene ontology  enrichment analysis of the functional significance was performed. out of  <dig> zmltp proteins, annotation could not be performed for  <dig> proteins. besides,  <dig> zmltps were defined in  <dig> significant go terms . the analysis showed that  <dig> zmltps were separated into two main categories , which included  <dig> and  <dig> significant go terms, respectively . for the enriched biological processes, the common categories are “response to stimulus” followed by “response to abiotic stimulus” and “response to stress”, “multicellular organismal process”, “biological regulation” and “establishment of localization”. noteworthy, about  <dig> zmltps were shown to participate in “lipid transport” , which is concordance with the molecular role of nsltp in transporting hydrophobic molecules in vitro, suggesting that zmltps play an important role in carrying membrane components to the growing site of elongating cells. the enriched go terms also include the parent term “response to abiotic stimulus” with enriched children term “response to cold”, and  <dig> %  zmltps were exhibited to participate in “response to stress stimulus” . this highlights the putative association of nsltp proteins in stress tolerance behavior of maize. in case of molecular functions, about  <dig> %  zmltps were shown to participate in “lipid binding” . one of the interesting observations was that some significantly enriched terms are involved in “water binding” and “ice binding”. to summarize, the go analysis indicated that zmltps may be involved in diverse biological processes.figure  <dig>

key cis-elements within the promoter regions of zmltp genes
in-silico analysis of 1 kb upstream region  of  <dig> maize nsltp genes revealed the presence of various regulatory elements, which are associated with development, abiotic or biotic stress signaling, and hormone signaling . to avoid the biases in analysis, only cis-elements identified in at least ten different genes were considered. as shown in figure 3b, except for tata-box and caat-box, g-box is the most frequently found type of cis-elements, and the regulatory element involving light responsiveness seems to be enriched in zmltps. nearly 80% of zmltps contained skn-1_motifs which might account for endosperm expression. stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements identified in this study included fungal elicitor responsive element , defense and stress responsive element , heat stress responsive element , low temperature responsive element , anaerobic-response element , myb binding site  involving in drought-inducibility and phytohormone-responsive elements, like auxin responsive element , methyl jasmonate responsive element , salicylic acid responsive element , abscisic acid responsive element  and gibberellic acid-responsive element . with a few exceptions, zmltps contained circadian elements, which may be responsible for its distinct diurnal expression pattern. other regulatory elements, such as o2-site , dre , cat-box  and ccgtcc-box  were also presented. especially, the promoters of  <dig> zmltps contained mbs elements ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> copies , indicating the important role of myb transcription factors in regulating zmltps. some recent reports have shown that nsltp can act as targets of myb to regulate plant tolerance to freezing and drought stresses  <cit> , suggested that the zmltp members participate in some abiotic stress signaling.

the diverse roles of nsltps in maize development
as for multigene family, the analysis of gene expression patterns often provides useful clues to decide genes function. to investigate the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the nsltp genes in the maize life cycle, hierarchical clustering was performed to visualize a global transcription profile of the zmltp genes across the  <dig> organs during diverse developmental stages. as depicted in figure  <dig>  the heatmap can be apparently divided into three clusters. cluster i contains  <dig> members . cluster ii has  <dig> members, and  <dig> members belong to cluster iii. genes in cluster i obviously have relatively high expression levels, with the mean log-signal values of each gene ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . conversely, cluster iii contains those genes with relatively low expression levels and the average log-signal value range is between  <dig>  and  <dig> . in cluster ii, genes are expressed at a moderate level with the mean log-signal values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . to elucidate putative differentially expressed genes in specific organs or stages, the coefficient of variation  of each gene in the three clusters was calculated . a house keeping gene in maize, which encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme , was used as internal reference in our expression analysis  <cit> . the results showed a huge variation among all the genes with the cv values ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. cluster i has the least expression variability from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, indicating a most stable expression pattern relative to other zmltp genes. zmltp <dig> , the most changeable genes in cluster i, whose homolog in rice, photoperiod-sensitive dwarf  <dig> , was previous demonstrated to encode a lipid transfer protein that may participate in regulation of plant cell division and elongation  <cit> . one gene , which can bind to calmodulin in a ca2+-independent manner  <cit> , displayed high expression levels at nearly all of the maize organs and/or stages of development analyzed except for root, immature cob and endosperm. a total of  <dig> nsltp protein-encoding genes were found to be highly expressed in anthers.  <dig> zmltps were found to be highly expressed in leaf at different developmental stages, whereas,  <dig> zmltps specially accumulated at v5_base of stage- <dig> leaf, v7_base of stage- <dig> leaf, v9_immature leaves, v9_eleventh leaf and v9_thirteenth leaf. cluster ii showed the highest expression variability, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. there are  <dig> genes with cv values more than 15% in cluster ii, among which  <dig> genes  have cv values more than 45% and display transcript accumulation at late seed developmental stages  and endosperm. it has been reported that betl <dig>  has its expression restricted to the endosperm transfer cells, which share their position as entrance gates to the developing seed for nutrients coming from the maternal tissues  <cit> . there is an increasing evidence that this protein might be involved in the defense of the developing seed against mother plant-borne pathogens  <cit> . genes in cluster iii showed an apparent fluctuation, with the cv values ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. in this context, cluster iii can be further divided into two subclusters, with genes in the first subcluster having higher signal intensity values than those in the second subcluster. in the first subcluster, four zmltps  displayed high expression levels during root development and this finding suggested that zmltps may participate in maize root development. the organ-specific expression dynamics revealed the distinct expression patterns of zmltp genes throughout the entire life cycle in maize. for example, two zmltp genes, zmltpg <dig> and zmltp <dig> , were specifically expressed in the anthers and coleoptile, respectively. there are  <dig> genes , with cv values among  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the second subcluster, distinctly increasing their expression levels in meiotic tassel. among them, zmltpc <dig> is highly homologous to mzm3- <dig>  which is expressed specifically in the tapetum during male gametogenesis of maize  <cit> . furthermore, four nsltp genes  were reported to be expressed in rice anther, which are putatively related to exine synthesis in sporophytic anthers of progressive developmental stages  <cit> . interestingly, these four rice nsltps were the homologs of zmltpc <dig>  zmltp <dig> , zmltp <dig>  and zmltpc <dig>  respectively. synthesis of lipidic components in anthers, including the pollen exine, is essential for plant male reproductive development. therefore, this finding further suggested that nsltps play significance roles in male reproductive development.figure  <dig>

pathogen responses of zmltps to the fungal infection
plant nsltps are capable of inhibiting bacterial and fungal pathogens and are, therefore, thought to play an important role in plant defense  <cit> . to discover the zmltp genes involved in maize pathogen response, microarray data collected after the treatments of  <dig>  24 hours,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , 8 days of ustilago maydis  infection were analyzed. u. maydis is a ubiquitous pathogen of maize which depends on living tissue for proliferation and development. a total of  <dig> probe sets found on the maize 18 k genechip could be assigned to  <dig> different zmltp genes . the log <dig> ratio values  were illustrated by a heatmap, showing the fold change in expression of each zmltp. as shown in additional file 16: figure s <dig>  most of the zmltps exhibited a delayed expression pattern after the infection of u. maydis.  <dig> zmltps distinctly increased their expression levels and accumulated mostly on the  <dig> and 8 days post infection, especially of zmltpg <dig>  zmltp <dig>  and zmltp <dig> , suggesting that these genes might participate in the pathogen response. interestingly, some zmltp genes show up-regulated expression levels over time, especially of zmltp <dig> , demonstrating a similar response pattern to this kind of fungus infection. besides, the expression levels of zmltpd <dig> and zmltp <dig>  show a rapid increase after infection, suggesting their high sensitivity to u. maydis infection. one nsltp from arabidopsis  has been suggested to be involved in long-distance signaling during pathogen defense  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to find a transcript accumulation of the zmltpd <dig>  a atdir <dig> homologue from maize, after the infection of u. maydis. in addition to the genes up-regulated after u. maydis infection, there are also some zmltp genes show a decline of expression levels as time goes by, such as zmltpg <dig> and zmltpd <dig>  these genes might function in other biological processes or respond to other kinds of pathogen attacks. taken together, these results presented here indicated that many genes in this family might participate in the pathogen response.

transcriptional responses of maize nsltp genes against abiotic stresses
apart from their inducibilities upon pathogen infection, nsltp genes are also responsive to abiotic stresses like drought, cold and salt  <cit> . to investigate the possible role of zmltps under drought stress, the microarrary data of two inbred lines, drought-tolerant line han <dig> and drought-sensitive line ye <dig>  under different drought treatments were used  <cit> . following whole-chip data processing,  <dig> %  zmltp genes, about  <dig> probes  in the microarray, were extracted for analysis . using fold change > <dig> and p value < <dig> , zmltp genes with changeable expression profiles in at least one conditions were regarded as differentially expressed genes . the result showed that  <dig> and  <dig> zmltps were differentially regulated by drought and/or re-watering treatment in han <dig> and ye <dig> maize inbred lines, respectively. interestingly, some zmltps appeared to be up-regulated in han <dig> under drought stress, suggesting that they may have a role in drought stress response in maize. for example, the transcript levels of zmltp <dig> , zmltp <dig>  and zmltp <dig> , were significantly up-regulated under moderate and severe drought stresses . furthermore, zmltp <dig>  and zmltpd <dig> showed high-abundance transcript levels under moderate drought condition compared to untreated samples. to verify the expression patterns of these predicted genes under drought stress,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis and the primers used in this assay are listed in additional file 17: table s <dig>  as shown in figure 5c, zmltp <dig> , zmltp <dig> , zmltp  <dig>  and zmltpd <dig> were obviously up-regulated in water deficient, whereas zmltpd <dig>  zmltpd <dig>  zmltpg <dig> and zmltpg <dig> were down-regulated under drought stress. taken together, qrt-pcr-based expression profiling for these selected genes confirmed the outcome of microarray analysis.figure  <dig>

in addition to dna microarray analysis, rna-seq analysis was performed to investigate the functions of zmltps involved in the differential drought sensitivity of maize reproductive  and vegetative tissues  under both drought and well-watered conditions  <cit> . nearly  <dig> %  of zmltps were reliably detected by rna-seq data . out of  <dig> expressed genes,  <dig> genes  were distinctly upregulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the drought-stressed ovary tissue, while  <dig>  were significantly up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated in the drought-stressed leaf meristem, suggesting that these zmltp genes may exhibit tissue-specific expression under drought stress.

many nsltps in plants have been reported to be closely related to drought stress. plants have a cuticle on the surface of their leaves that provides a protective barrier against the environmental adversities, such as drought stress. in arabidopsis, atltpg <dig>  which have close phylogenetic relationship with zmltpg <dig> in maize, play a role in wax and/or cutin monomer transport  <cit> . in our study, the expression level of zmltpg <dig> was increased in drought-stressed ovary tissue, implying a possible role in drought resistance. zmltp <dig> , which was reported as the target of calmodulin, was significantly down-regulated in drought-stressed ovary tissue but up-regulated in drought-stressed leaf meristem. as expected, a stresses-response gene, zmltp <dig> , also increases its expression level in the drought-stressed leaf meristem, whereas it was down-regulated in the drought-stressed ovary tissue. in any case, the analysis of the expression profiles based on both microarray and rna-seq methods proved that zmltps may play important roles in maize tolerance to drought stress. while further work is required for understanding how zmltps are mechanistically linked to drought stress responses in maize.

apart from understanding the effect of drought stress on the transcript levels of various maize nsltp genes, it is also important to conceive about the expression level of these genes under the salt stress. root is the first organ directly exposed to salt stress. to better understand the roles of zmltp genes in salt stress responses, rna-seq analysis was performed to explore the expression profiles of zmltps in three root types of maize  under salt stress. nearly  <dig> %  of zmltps were detected by rna-seq. as shown in additional file 19: figure s <dig>   <dig> zmltp genes  and  <dig> genes  were found to be at least two-fold up-regulated in the pr and sr under salt stress, respectively. under salt stress,  <dig> zmltp genes  significantly increased their expression levels in cr. it can be concluded that the gene expression profiles of zmltps are more variable in the cr than those in pr and sr under salt stress. one zmltp gene, zmltpd <dig>  was highly induced by salt stress in pr, sr and cr, suggesting that it may play an important role in salt stress response in maize. in addition, zmltp <dig>  was specifically expressed in cr, which is accordance with previous report that zmltp <dig>  may participate in salt resistance  <cit> .

it is well-known that plants are constantly exposed to a variety of environmental stresses. among them, the low temperature constitutes a key factor that can influence plant growth, development and crop productivity. the accumulation of soluble sugar and proline are important to protect plants against cold stress  <cit> . in previous research, the expression of rice cold-inducible nsltp gene in transgenic phalaenopsis amabilis improved its adaptive responses to cold stress. the examination of transgenic plants showed the increased accumulation of several compatible solutes such as total soluble sugars and proline  <cit> . to further dissect the biological function of zmltps in cold tolerance, we investigate the possible roles of zmltps under cold stress condition in two inbred maize lines, chilling-sensitive eth-dl <dig> and chilling-tolerant eth-dh <dig>  <cit> . following whole-chip data processing, 54%  zmltps have corresponding probe sets in the microarray, and a total of  <dig> probe sets on the maize 58 k nsf array  were extracted for analysis . three zmltps  were defined as differentially expressed genes in response to cold stress . surprisingly, all of the three differentially expressed genes were up-regulated under severe cold stress. among them, zmltpd <dig> and zmltpg <dig> were differentially expressed under the severe cold stress conditions in eth-dh <dig>  and zmltp <dig>  and zmltpd <dig> was up-regulated under severe cold stress conditions in eth-dl <dig> 

our results revealed effects of drought, salt and cold stress on transcript abundance of several members of maize nsltp gene family, indicative of their important roles in abiotic stresses. moreover, the promoters for most of zmltps were found to contain one or more important cis-regulatory elements such as abre, mbs, tc-rich repeat and c-repeat/dre , which might be involved in regulation of expression of zmltps under these stress conditions. thus, expression profiling against abiotic stresses provided novel insights into specific and/or overlapping expression patterns of nsltp genes. these analyses will contribute to the studies for unraveling the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction, stress response, and developmental processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> nsltp genes in maize genome, and the members in this family can be divided into five types . comprehensive study of zmltps provided some important features of this gene family such as gene structure, duplicated event, and three-dimensional structure. additionally, gene ontology analysis was performed to obtain clues about biological function of the zmltps. the analyses of putative upstream regulatory elements further indicated that zmltps may be involved in diverse biological processes and provided new insights into the shared and different transcriptional regulation machineries of zmltps. the expression profiles of zmltps across the different developmental stages showed that some members of this family exhibit tissue-specific expression, indicative of their important roles in performing diverse developmental and physiological functions during the maize life cycle. further, we focused on the roles of maize nsltps in stress responses. the result indicated that some zmltps exhibited a delayed expression pattern after the infection of ustilago maydis and differentially expressed under drought, salt and cold stress, which may be used in further studies for improving stress tolerance in maize. in a word, our results are significant contributions to maize molecular breeding with enhanced quality traits.
