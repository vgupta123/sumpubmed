BACKGROUND
recent syntheses have highlighted geological evidence for the occurrence of fire since the triassic, particularly over the last 65− <dig> million years 
 <cit> , suggesting that fire may have had a major role in the evolution of angiosperms
 <cit> . however, fire as an important agent of natural selection has received little attention because fireprone floras are usually thought to have appeared only after the global climate became more arid and seasonal < <dig> million years ago  making their fire-related traits ‘exaptations’ at best
 <cit> . recent trait-assignment studies have shown that fireprone floras likely existed in australia
 <cit>  and the cape of south africa
 <cit>  earlier than that  coinciding with the appearance of fire-adapted traits. however, estimates of the time of origin of ancestral fire-related traits and fireproneness of the habitat occupied by the root of the clade may still have been constrained by the a) insufficient age of the clade, or b) inability of the dna in extant organisms to adequately reflect the fossil record because of lineage  loss. that is, the estimated time of origin of fire-related traits or fireprone habitats may be limited by the estimated age of the clade not necessarily by the inauguration of recurrent fires .

by way of example, trait-assignment analysis of dryandra  records fire in southwestern australia from  <dig>  ma as it originated then but its co-occurring parent group, banksia ss, records fire in southwestern australia  much earlier from  <dig> ma . equally, fire might have been present in australia earlier but  <dig> ma is the limit of the age of the banksia clade so cannot be used to detect it any earlier. the same constraint applies to disa when inferring age of fire in the cape
 <cit> . in addition, molecular analysis shows that fire-adapted banksias were in eastern australia from  <dig>  ma
 <cit> , yet pollen and leaf fossils are known from there  since at least  <dig> ma
 <cit> , figure 
1b. this suggests that waves of extinction/migration have occurred in eastern australia, such dynamics being missed by a simple molecular analysis because the relevant lineages have been lost.

thus, inferring the time of origin of fireprone floras using individual genera within a family can be artificially constrained by extinction of certain lineages or age of the clade itself, ignoring the possibility that it was a change in the fire regime that stimulated the evolution of the clade in the first place. however, the family proteaceae can be traced to  <dig> ma 
 <cit>  and holds promise as a demonstration of unconstrained evolutionary responses to fire as it is considered to have rainforest-climate  origins and its extant fire-adapted traits in fireprone floras are well known. seeds stored on the plant  and released via fire heat
 <cit> , or transferred to the soil via wind or ants
 <cit>  and cued to germinate by fire heat or smoke
 <cit> , figure 
1c−i, are critical functional traits in fireprone environments
 <cit> , as they enable seeds to germinate in response to fire when recruitment conditions are optimal . hence, we may view the various types of seed storage/release/germination as fire-adapted traits, in the sense of increasing fitness in the presence of fire
 <cit> . seed storage/germination type is a conserved generic trait so that we were able to superimpose the three major syndromes of seed storage/germination  onto a recently produced proteaceae chronogram . critically from an adaptation perspective , we sought to test whether the three types of seed storage have evolved synchronously with the onset of fireprone habitats occupied by this family. if this were so it would be the first evidence of fire-adapted traits occurring among flowering plants as far back as the cretaceous, a time of high flammability and escalating species diversification rates
 <cit> .

we chose seed storage/release/germination traits as these are well documented for the entire family and are invariably diagnostic for each genus, and difficult to interpret as other than fire-adapted
 <cit> . other putative fire-related traits that also have been examined in proteaceous genera, such as dead leaf retention, fire-stimulated flowering and resprouting
 <cit> , have the disadvantages that they are poorly documented by comparison , are not clearly ancestral within the genus or definitely derived
 <cit> , and/or not yet convincingly shown to have greatest fitness in the presence of recurrent fire. much more research at the level of documenting occurrence of these traits and demonstrating superior fitness at the species level is required before their evolutionary history can be considered further.

RESULTS
analysing the entire family proteaceae confirmed that it was able to provide an unconstrained estimate of the time fire-related traits and fireprone floras originated . our ancestral state reconstructions, using both range expansion and fireprone trait allocation approaches , were the same, showing that the origin of fireprone proteaceous floras can be traced to  <dig>  ma, at the root of the indehiscent clades  and  <dig> million years  younger than the origin of the family clade
 <cit> . this time coincided with the migration of shrubby, fine-leaved ancestors from closed forest to fireprone habitats . thus, the first  <dig> my existence of the proteaceae clade was confined to closed forest, but not until the indehiscent-fruited ancestors of the proteoideae colonized fireprone sclerophyll woodland/forest  did its genera and species proliferate . this difference in the pattern of speciation between fireprone and non-fireprone habitats was not the same for the dehiscent-fruited clade  at the generic level but it was at the species diversification level within genera. for the entire family we identify five dispersal events from rainforest to fireprone environments that usually led to explosive speciation among their lineages, on average  <dig>  times the rate in closed forest . there appear to be six genera showing migration events in the reverse direction although four retained species or populations in fireprone habitats, two remained monotypic and dilobeia has only three species .

during the coniacian−campanian stages of the upper cretaceous , fireprone clades appear with a wide array of seed storage/ release/germination responses to fire, especially in the proteoideae. if seed storage as a trait is substituted for soil or canopy storage  then there is a minimum  <dig>  probability of some form of storage at  <dig> ma to certainty at  <dig> ma . the assignments indicate that the 70− <dig> ma period was a time of much initiation, proliferation and extinction of traits among the early clades. by  <dig>  ma, the stem of the petrophile−aulax clade suggests that serotiny may have arisen in the australian region of eastern gondwana
 <cit>  while banksia is the oldest extant serotinous genus there at  <dig>  ma. serotiny appeared last in the archetype sclerophyll genus, hakea, arising independently from rainforest ancestors  <dig> ma . the stem of the cape proteeae  arose from australian ancestors
 <cit> , so it is less clear for how long the cape flora has been fireprone. the habitat type of the stem of proteafaurea is fireprone because of the fireprone status of the surrounding lineages  but it is non-serotinous  and lacks storage. at  <dig>  ma, aulax is the oldest extant genus in fireprone habitats of the cape.

the franklandia–mimetes clade  originating  <dig>  ma is the oldest with soil storage . this is followed almost immediately, and independently, by the stirlingia−conospermum−synaphea clade  originating  <dig>  ma. adenanthos−leucadendron to mimetes is the only clade in the proteoideae with an aril  attached to the single-seeded fruit as an aid to dispersal and burial by ants . the stem of this elaborate dispersal/storage/germination response to fire is dated from  <dig>   ma for adenanthos in swa and the leucadendron to mimetes subclade in the cape . these are among some of the earliest elaiosome-bearing lineages known and correspond to the advent of ants as reliable dispersal agents
 <cit> . in contrast, the highly speciose genus, grevillea, was the only grevilleoid to develop ant dispersal traits and this appeared very late . overall, each of the three seed storage syndromes evolved closely and synchronously with fireprone habitats in this family ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , p <  <dig> ,
 <cit> ).

discussion
flowering plants had small beginnings in gondwana during the mid-cretaceous  but the proteaceae was abundant in antarctic temperate rainforests by the campanian 
 <cit> . however, our analysis shows that recurrent fire must already have been influencing the path of evolution among proteaceae by the mid-upper cretaceous  and has continued as a strong agent of selection ever since, based on the continual appearance of fire-tolerant clades . the chronogram and trait assignment analysis indicate that ancestors to the dry indehiscent-fruited section of the family, the subfamilies proteoideae and symphionematoideae, were already present in fireprone habitats by that time.

did these clades actually exist by then? the fossil record supports the existence of pollen with affinities to at least two extant genera in the proteoideae, and  <dig> pollen types whose proteaceae affinities are less prescribed, in eastern gondwana  during the santonian-campanian 
 <cit> . dettmann and jarzen
 <cit>  concluded that the southern australian/antarctic vegetation in this period must have been a mosaic of rainforest  and sclerophyll communities, with the proteaceae prominent in the latter .

did suitable habitats exist by then? by 90− <dig> ma most of the current australian portion of eastern gondwana had emerged due to sedimentation  and general elevation of the continent
 <cit> , including the otway, eromanga and murray basins. the sedimentary basins: eucla, officer and surat, were already exposed by 100− <dig> ma. in addition, various metasediments were uplifted/downwarped in the lower-mid-cretaceous . heavy leaching due to the high but seasonal rainfall during the upper cretaceous created oligotrophic sands and ferricretes
 <cit> . there has even been the suggestion that the proteaceae was a  driver in this process
 <cit> . thus, well-drained, nutrient-poor substrates  of variable elevation and suitable for colonization by the evolving sclerophyll element were already widespread.

were these habitats also fireprone? not only were carbon dioxide levels and mean temperatures much higher than currently 
 <cit>  but calculated oxygen levels 80− <dig> ma were 25% higher , all greatly enhancing flammability. bond and scott
 <cit>  note in addition strong seasonality, frequent lightning and charcoalified fossils peaking at 65– <dig> ma, though these values are biased towards the northern hemisphere. the presence of indehiscent-fruited proteaceae in fireprone habitats for the first time at  <dig> ma coincides with the peak or just postpeak atmospheric levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature and burn probability in the presence of an ignition source over the last  <dig> my , bearing in mind that crown angiosperms appeared about  <dig> ma
 <cit> . the nutrient-impoverished substrates where sclerophyllous proteaceae are favoured would have supported dense, shrubby evergreen vegetation with highly flammable foliage particularly vulnerable to lightning ignition at this time. the proteoideae itself would have contributed to this flammability: small, acicular or highly divided isolateral leaves, finely divided foliage, highly sclerophyllous, long-lived leaves with low nutrient content and poorly decomposable litter
 <cit> .

 <cit> .

is there direct evidence of fire at that time? abundant charcoal is recorded in the eromanga basin, sw queensland, at 100– <dig> ma
 <cit> . charcoal was noted among pollen samples in zealandia at 94– <dig> ma
 <cit> , together with other evidence “suggesting a generally broad occurrence of fire in the mid-cretaceous across middle to high latitudes in the southern hemisphere” that the authors attributed in part to the high atmospheric oxygen. charcoalified fragments  made up 40% of the microsamples that contained pollen of >  <dig> proteaceae species  in zealandian sandstones at 88– <dig> ma
 <cit>  indicating that “wildfires were part of the late cretaceous ecosystem”. eklund et al.
 <cit>  studied 83-my-old charcoalified mesofossils of angiosperms between antarctica and australia that they attributed to fires caused by volcanism near the collection site.

was there selection against the fire-sensitive ancestors that might have biased the assignments? figure 
 <dig> shows that net lineage proliferation at the generic level has continued steadily and in parallel for both fireprone and non-fireprone groups. this means that fire-sensitive clades did not become extinct at the expense of fire-tolerant clades that might have distorted the analysis – this is consistent with both being accommodated in different vegetation types through time preventing their extinction
 <cit> . if extinction was recent it would have to be on a massive scale to delete all trace of the non-fire-tolerant lineage. it seems that even during the last glacial maximum, rainforest species in eastern australia, including proteaceae, were able to survive in moister lowland refugia
 <cit> . further, if  extinction of fire-sensitive taxa had occurred along basal stems of clades that our analysis currently assigns as in fireprone habitats, this would not alter the assignment as this  infers that the surviving lineage was fire-tolerant at that point in time. the only requirement then is to show that the lineage actually existed at that time via fossil evidence. in this regard it is noteworthy that  <dig> of the  <dig> pollen/leaf types assessed by sauquet et al.
 <cit>  were allocated to the base of extant rainforest clades or sediments arising >  <dig> ma, i.e. prior to the oldest time that our analysis identifies fireprone habitats for the proteaceae. in addition, five are associated with younger rainforest clades, ten with fireprone habitats, and all  <dig> can be traced to extant genera , i.e. none necessarily implies an extinct lineage.

a related problem with the purported origin of the three extant fire-tolerant proteaceae lineages in the upper cretaceous  is the possible exterminatory effect of the subsequent early eocene , one of the wettest periods known. indeed, fire-derived inertinite in coal dropped markedly in northern hemisphere mires after  <dig> ma
 <cit> . while the climate was especially wet and aseasonal throughout eastern gondwana during the eocene, it remained warm  and much of the central-west zones of the australian portion of gondwana had moderate and strongly seasonal rainfall
 <cit> . atmospheric oxygen levels were up to 15% higher than currently and burn probability was the highest for the last  <dig> my . further, deeply weathered sands or siliceous/lateritic rocks, often in open, well-drained parts of the landscape, were widespread and would have provided ideal refugia for the sclerophylls, especially proteaceae, in their own communities
 <cit> . indeed, the proteaceae  at lake lefroy, swa in the mid-eocene accounted for 34% of all pollen , with species richness values comparable with those in swa scrub-heath today
 <cit> . interestingly, where fire did occur around the eastern otway basin, it not only led to a severe reduction in nothofagus but also in proteaceae and myrtaceae
 <cit> , implying that the species there were more vulnerable to fire than their western counterparts
 <cit> .

we therefore suggest that much of the fire-dependent, sclerophyll element contracted west during the eocene. some of these returned/expanded in a second wave of migration during the oligocene-miocene  but usually remained poorly represented , others did not return , while others only arose then but never reached eastern australia . in support, figure 
 <dig> shows no increase in proliferation rates of non-fireprone-habitat lineages at the expense of fireprone lineages in the 40– <dig> my period; if anything the reverse is true. in addition, we point to the exacerbated bias against increasingly isolated pockets of sclerophyll vegetation in the fossil record from lake sediments during particularly wet periods, and note that strongly fire-adapted pinus in the nh  and nuytsia in swa  have also been recorded from the mid-eocene
 <cit> .

finally, the two seed storage mechanisms that facilitate postfire germination and seedling recruitment were already appearing 88− <dig> ma according to our analysis, though neither type prevailed in any clade, indicating that much diversification and extinction along the major stems must have been occurring. by  <dig> ma, seed storage was firmly established in one basal clade. by  <dig> ma, clades in fire-prone habitats were characterized by either soil or on-plant fruit storage . note that the two rainforest genera in proteoideae, eidotheia and delobeia, did not speciate to any extent , while two remained monotypic  or had limited speciation  in genera with populations or species respectively largely remaining in rainforest today. in particular, only beauprea among the seven genera occupying mixed habitats has the capacity for seed storage, though it would be of interest to know why this once-widespread genus became extinct in australia. the only genera lacking strong speciation once in fireprone habitats are beaupreopsis, with a small soil-stored pyrene, that occurs in scrub-heath of new caledonia and is monotypic , and symphionema with two species in scrub-heath of nsw and possesses a thin-walled achene “expected to show some form of dormancy”
 <cit> . comparing speciation rates overall between fireprone-habitat and non-fireprone sister clades , the pivotal role of seed storage for successful occupation of fireprone habitats is supported  and the two are highly correlated through time  confirming their classification as true fire adaptations.

the mechanism of seed storage on the plant is different between the grevilleoideae and proteoideae: in the former, woody fruits protect and support the seeds and dehisce in response to heat and desiccation while, in the latter, bracts  protect and support the fruits and spread to release the single-seeded fruits in response to heat and desiccation. this has arisen four times independently in the grevilleoideae, and four times in the proteoideae . while they were treated as the one trait for purposes of the analysis this did not create origin artefacts as the two subfamilies remained independent with respect to the evolution of serotiny in the family.

all soil-stored seeds are actually one-seeded fruits in the proteaceae , comprising a thin pericarp , exotesta  and crystalliferous endotesta
 <cit> . the succulent-fruited persoonieae  had an independent origin from the dry-fruited proteoideae/symphionematoideae that appeared independently five times . leucadendron has a possible sixth independent origin where our informal analysis of a cladogram for  <dig> of its  <dig> taxa
 <cit>  indicates that the ancestral state is serotiny with winged fruits followed by dormant nutlets and soil-stored achenes, followed much later by a few species with elaiosome-bearing achenes – this requires more detailed research, especially the need for smoke-stimulated germination throughout the genus. this is the only genus that had to be assigned mixed traits – in all others the assigned trait was part of the circumscription of the genus or shown to be the ancestral condition . the separate origins of soil-storage in the stirlingia–synaphea  and franklandia–mimetes  clades do not merge in the analysis . grevillea, with its exotesta modified into a brittle wing or aril attractive to ants, is unique among the dehiscent proteaceae and had no effect on the outcomes for ancestral assignments of soil-storage.

CONCLUSIONS
fireproneness among gondwanan floras can now be traced back to the fiery cretaceous and trait assignment affirms serotiny and soil seed storage, and later ant dispersal, as ancient adaptations to fire among flowering plants. most species in over  <dig> extant flowering-plant families of the sclerophyll vegetation in australia have some form of seed storage, and up to  <dig>  seeds from many families are stored per m <dig> of soil in fireprone sclerophyll communities throughout the world
 <cit> . this means that other clades and floras should now be examined to see if they have a similarly ancient relationship with fire as a vital agent of natural selection favouring seed storage. since proteaceae is among the oldest of the eudicot families and only monocots  migrated into fireprone habitats among older clades
 <cit> , it will be interesting to see if dates older than  <dig> ma for fire-related traits can be identified among flowering plants. he et al.
 <cit>  have shown recently that fire-related traits appeared among pines  up to  <dig> ma, but especially from  <dig> ma when canopy seed storage originated in association with more intense, crown fires. the similarity of these two dates , with one family confined to the northern hemisphere and the other to the southern, is remarkable. however, other flowering plant orders/families well known for their fire-tolerant traits also arose around this time  and this raises the prospect that we may have identified a time of great significance in the fire history of seed plants generally.
