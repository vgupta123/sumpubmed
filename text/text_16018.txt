BACKGROUND
because plants lack the ability of locomotion, they are exposed to various environmental stresses. temperature stress is the most common type of stress to which plants are subjected. temperature-related stress can occur at  temperatures below freezing,  low temperatures above freezing, and  high temperatures  <cit> . stressful temperature conditions can damage the enzymes needed for photosynthesis, respiration, and protein synthesis and so affect the growth and development of plants  <cit> . consequently, plants have evolved mechanisms to monitor their environments and to respond with cellular, physiological, and developmental changes to optimize growth and reproductive success.

intertidal seaweeds inhabit an inherently stressful environment with rapidly changing physical conditions. seaweed in this zone undergoes extreme environmental changes that include desiccation, osmotic shock, exposure to intense sunlight, and high and freezing temperatures. a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in abiotic stress tolerance in seaweeds could help elucidate their successful survival, reproduction, and distribution in the intertidal region. transcriptome analysis is an efficient way of achieving this goal. a transcriptome is a complete set of the transcripts in a cell that becomes active at a specific developmental stage or under certain physiological conditions. transcriptomes provide information that can be used to identify the functional elements of the genome and the molecular constituents of cells and tissues  <cit> . digital gene expression , which is based on the sequencing of genome-wide expression profiles, is an efficient method that can be used to analyze transcriptome data and so identify, quantify, and annotate expressed genes at the genome level even without prior sequence knowledge. this allows for higher confidence in target discovery and pathway studies. currently, this technique is widely used in higher plant research. in the chinese bayberry , it has been used to examine gene expression in developing bayberry fruit. results showed energy-related metabolism to be enhanced and all genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis to be up-regulated during the fruit ripening processes  <cit> . in lycoris sprengeri, dge was performed to evaluate differential gene expression between bulbs and bulblets and determine the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying bulb development  <cit> . in vitis vinifera, it was used to describe how plant transcriptomes change during three developmental stages, post setting, veraison, and ripening  <cit> .

pyropia yezoensis , m.s. hwang & h.g. choi, one of the most economically important marine crops, is widely cultivated in china, japan, and korea, with an annual harvest of more than  <dig> million tons  and a value of over u.s. $ <dig>  billion per year . p. yezoensis is naturally distributed in the intertidal zone of the temperate region in the northern hemisphere. in this region, the temperature may change dramatically between seawater and air, especially in the changeover seasons between autumn and winter as well as winter and spring. the thallus of p. yezoensis is totally submerged in the water during high tide but exposed to air during low tide. consequently, the thallus may suffer from the stress of high or low temperature and abrupt temperature changes. this makes this alga an ideal research model for investigations of the mechanisms underlying temperature stress tolerance in intertidal seaweed.

the effect of temperature on algae has been studied. in chondrus crispus it has been reported that plants subjected to high natural stress have more differentially expressed genes and more potential marker genes, and express more antioxidative genes and hsps. many of these up-regulated genes are stress genes  <cit> . gracilaria cornea showed photosynthetic and respiratory responses adapted to oceanic salinities and subtropical to tropical water temperatures  <cit> . studies of pyropia have been conducted at the physiological, genomic, and proteomic level. for example, kayama et al. reported that water temperature can affect the fatty acid composition of pyropia  <cit> . choi et al. reported that most of the transcripts produced by pyropia tenera under high-temperature conditions were from the heat shock protein family  <cit> ; xu et al. conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of pyropia haitanensis in response to high-temperature stress using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy and database searching, indicating that the algal blades resisted high-temperature stress by inhibiting photosynthesis and other nonessential metabolic processes  <cit> .

in this paper, gene expression and regulation in response to temperature stresses were examined by performing genome-wide high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing for p. yezoensis. in view of the unique intertidal environment, four treatments were used: high-temperature stress, chilling stress, freezing stress and normal temperature. the dge approach was used to comparatively analyze the expression patterns and characterize the genes that influenced physiological, developmental, and biochemical processes on a genome-wide basis when p. yezoensis was subjected to extreme temperature fluctuations. this sequencing dataset and analysis may serve as a valuable resource for identifying the key genes and pathways involved in responses to temperature stresses in p. yezoensis. this will lay the foundation for identifying the mechanisms underlying extreme temperature tolerance and may provide information needed for the genetic breeding of high- and low-temperature tolerant varieties.

RESULTS
global transcriptome assembly and annotation
a global transcriptome was generated using samples from different developmental phases and treatments to obtain as many functional gene transcripts as possible. a total of  <dig>  ×  <dig> quality paired-end reads were obtained after filtering out low-quality data . the gc content of the transcriptome was  <dig> %. after assembly and annotation, a total of  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> value of  <dig> bp were obtained. unigenes with lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> bp were overrepresented, comprising approximately  <dig> % of the total number of unigenes; the next most abundant size class was 500– <dig> bp, constituting approximately  <dig> % of the total unigenes. there were fewer unigenes with lengths of 1– <dig> kbp and more than  <dig> kbp, i.e., approximately  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total, respectively. the longest unigene was  <dig> bp .figure  <dig> size distribution of the assembled unigenes.

global analysis of the unigenes in the four temperature treatment groups
deseq analysis was performed to identify the genes that had been differentially expressed between the different temperature treatment groups. a total of  <dig>  expressed unigenes were obtained, of which  <dig>  were found in all samples . the comparison showed  <dig> unigenes to be unique to the high-temperature treatment group,  <dig> to the chilling group, and  <dig> to the freezing group.figure  <dig> venn diagram showing the number of expressed unigenes in the nt, ht, cs, and fs treatments. this venn diagram was drawn using the number of genes expressed  in the four treatments .



a hierarchical cluster was used to determine the profiles of the differentially expressed unigenes among the four temperature stress treatments . hierarchical clustering showed that the differentially expressed unigenes could be divided into  <dig> subclusters based on the modulation of their expression, representing  <dig> different expression models . unigenes with the same or similar expression patterns were gathered in the same cluster. the overall pattern of transcript changes in the freezing temperature treatment at −8°c and the chilling temperature at 0°c were similar to that of the normal temperature at 8°c. the pattern under the high temperature treatment at 24°c was markedly different from that of the other three treatment groups . the results clearly indicate that p. yezoensis used different mechanisms in response to high- and low-temperature stresses, but it used similar mechanisms in response to the chilling and freezing treatments.figure  <dig> clustering analyses of degs in the four temperature treatments. clusters were obtained using the hierarchical-means method based on the  <dig> degs .  heatmap of hierarchical clustering. each column represents a treatment, and each row represents a unigene. differences in expression were shown in different colors. negative numbers indicate down-regulated and positive number means up-regulated.  hierarchical clustering figure of differentially expressed genes. the “x” axis represents the treatments. the “y” axis represents the value of the relative expression level ). in the subcluster, the gray line represents the value of the relative expression levels, the blue line represents the mean value of the relative expression level, and the red line is the reference. the subclusters in figure b represent the models in figure a from the top down.



in subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes were found to be closely related to translation of genetic information. these included genes related to the pathway of ribosome and rna transport. in subcluster  <dig>  the pathway associated with carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism were significantly enriched, including genes for the pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. in subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes related to the synthesis and decomposition of carbohydrates were affected in a manner similar to those in subcluster  <dig>  except that there were more unigenes related to amino acid metabolism. in subcluster  <dig>  subcluster  <dig>  and subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes were not concentrated but rather related to many processes . in subcluster  <dig>  the unigenes were up-regulated in response to high-temperature stress, and the pathway associated with replication and repair of dna were significantly enriched, showing the same expression trends as in subcluster  <dig>  these unigenes were closely related to protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.

number of differential expression unigenes
differentially expressed unigenes with a q-value ≤  <dig>   <cit>  between pairwise combinations of the treatments were identified. a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> significantly altered unigenes were detected between nt and ht, nt and cs, and nt and fs, respectively. a total of  <dig> unigenes showed expression different from nt in all three treatment groups .figure  <dig> venn diagram of degs under the control and temperature-stressed conditions. this venn diagram was drawn using the number of different expression genes in the three stress treatments  relative to the control group .



gene ontology functional analysis of degs
gene ontology functional analysis of degs was performed to describe the properties of genes and their products in p. yezoensis subjected to different temperature stresses. for the biological process category, the two mostly highly represented terms among the  <dig> level- <dig> categories were cellular process and metabolic process; for the cellular component category, the mostly highly represented terms among the  <dig> level- <dig> categories were cell, cell part, macromolecular complex and organelle; for the molecular function category, the two mostly highly represented terms among the  <dig> level- <dig> categories were binding and catalytic activity .figure  <dig> comparative distribution of the go terms in the four treatment groups.



degs in response to chilling treatment
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were identified in cs, relative to nt. these included  <dig> up-regulated unigenes and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes . the top  <dig> down- and up-regulated genes are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  based on kegg analysis, the up-regulated unigenes were highly enriched in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. the down-regulated unigenes were highly enriched in aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis and porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism. go enrichment showed there to be  <dig> and  <dig> significantly enriched go terms in the up- and down-regulated unigenes, respectively .figure  <dig> number of degs in the different temperature stress groups.



in higher plants, increased synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids  occurs in response to chilling stress. deg analysis revealed  <dig> fatty acid desaturase  unigenes among the  <dig> up-regulated unigenes, but no fad unigenes were found among the down-regulated unigenes. among the  <dig> degs, unigenes encoding glutathione s-transferase, oxidoreductase, and thioredoxin were found. these promote chilling tolerance by maintaining cell redox homeostasis. two categories of degs functioning as temperature sensors were analyzed, both histone deacetylase complex and transcription factor. results showed an up-regulated unigene encoding the histone acetyltransferase complex and a down-regulated unigene encoding the histone deacetylase complex.  <dig> unigenes encoding transcription factor that included basic leucine zipper , upstream activation factor , and myeloblastosis oncogene were differentially regulated.

degs in response to freezing treatment
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were found in fs, relative to nt;  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated and  <dig> unigenes were down-regulated . the top  <dig> down- and up-regulated genes are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  there were fewer degs in fs than in cs and ht. it can be inferred that, under freezing conditions, many physiological functions are suspended and the expression levels of the unigenes were maintained at a normal level. among the up-regulated unigenes, there were  <dig> fad unigenes and one unigene encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. there were also many unigenes encoding glutathione s-transferase, oxidoreductase, thioredoxin, and the histone acetyltransferase complex, which promote chilling tolerance, like the unigenes found in cs. as noted in the global analysis of the gene expression component, fs has a pattern of expression similar to that of cs. go enrichment analysis showed there to be  <dig> significantly enriched go terms among the up-regulated unigenes and  <dig> significantly enriched go terms among the down-regulated unigenes .

degs in response to heat treatment
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were identified in ht, relative to nt;  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated and  <dig> unigenes were down-regulated . the top  <dig> down- and up-regulated genes are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  kegg analysis showed that the up-regulated degs were highly enriched in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and the down-regulated unigenes were enriched in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, one carbon pool by folate, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, and rna transport. go enrichment analysis showed that  <dig> go terms were significantly enriched in the down-regulated unigenes, but among the up-regulated unigenes, no go terms were enriched .

in this study, three categories of degs functioning as temperature sensors were found, including heat shock proteins , h2a, and transcription factors. among the up-regulated unigene pools, there were  <dig> well-characterized hsps . in addition,  <dig> up-regulated unigenes encoding h2a, which is believed to be a temperature sensor, were found. an additional  <dig> transcription factor  unigenes were differentially regulated in ht and nt, including bzip, c-repeat binding factor , tfiib, and uaf. a multiprotein bridging factor  <dig>  was up-regulated. among the top  <dig> down-regulated unigenes,  <dig> were chloroplast genes. four unigenes encoding metacaspase were found to be up-regulated under high temperature stress which was consider to play an important role in programmed cell death.

validation of rna-seq-based gene expression
to validate the expression profiles obtained by rna-seq, rt-pcr was performed on seven genes selected at random with high or low expression levels. expression comparisons were performed between ht and nt, cs and nt, and fs and nt by rt-pcr. for all of the genes, the trend in rt-pcr expression was in agreement with the rna-seq data except for comp8549_c <dig> .figure  <dig> rt-pcr analysis of  <dig> randomly selected unigenes.  gene expression data for dge analysis. the fold changes of the genes were calculated as the log <dig> vaule of ht/nt, cs/nt and fs/nt and shown on the y-axis.  the qrt-pcr analysis of gene expression data. expression ratios of these genes in ht, cs and fs were compared to nt, respectively).



discussion
role of unsaturated fatty acids under low temperature stress conditions
in general, plants regulate the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to change membrane fluidity in response to temperature stress. in both yeast and cyanobacteria, it has been hypothesized that temperature-mediated alterations of membrane fluidity may themselves be the primary temperature sensing event. it has been speculated that the same might be true in higher plants  <cit> . in this study, a total of  <dig> unigenes encoding fatty acid desaturases were found, in which  <dig> unigenes belonging to  <dig> diverse types were differentially expressed . in higher plants, it has been reported that cold tolerance is closely correlated to the level of unsaturated fatty acids in phosphatidylglycerol from the chloroplast membrane, especially in the sn- <dig> position  <cit> . plants synthesize 18: <dig> n- <dig> and 18: <dig> n- <dig> from saturated fatty acid 18:0; these are catalyzed by soluble delta- <dig> acyl-acp, membrane-bound delta- <dig> fatty acid and ω <dig> desaturases, respectively  <cit> . delta- <dig> fatty acid desaturase catalyzes the formation of the initial double bond between the 9th and 10th carbons of palmitoyl  and stearoyl  coenzyme a  substrates to produce 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> fatty acids, respectively  <cit> . delta- <dig> fatty acid desaturase is located in plastids and catalyzes the introduction of a double bond into 18: <dig> n- <dig> esterified in the sn- <dig> position of glycerolipids  <cit> . in the cs and fs treatments, all  <dig> fad were up-regulated, promoting the synthesis of fatty acid desaturases, thereby increasing membrane fluidity, which results in acclimation to chilling stress in the intertidal zone. in the high-temperature treatment group,  <dig> fad were down-regulated. in the kegg database,  <dig> unigenes were successfully annotated to the pathway of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis . in the high-temperature treatment group, in addition to the  <dig> down-regulated fads, the unigene comp704_c <dig> encodding 3-hydroxy acyl-coa dehydratase was up-regulated which takes part in fatty acid elongation.table  <dig>

hsp in response to temperature stresses
it is well established that hsp contributes greatly to cell protection through the folding and translocation of nascent proteins, the refolding of denatured proteins, and the disassembly of already formed protein aggregates under both stress and non-stress conditions  <cit> . based on subunit sizes, hsp can be divided into  <dig> groups, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and small hsp. in this study, a total of  <dig> unigenes were found to encode hsp. the expression level of the most of the unigenes was not significantly different, while their expression levels were high . in addition, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> were found to significantly differently expressed as a result of the temperature treatment . recently, hsp <dig> has attracted widespread attention; this protein plays a vital role in the transport of nascent proteins across membranes into organelles, the folding of newly translated proteins, the repair of misfolded proteins, and targeting damaged proteins for degradation  <cit> . when plants suffer from stress, hsp70s are up-regulated, participate in the refolding of denatured proteins, maintain cell homeostasis, and protect organisms from damage  <cit> . nine unigenes encoded hsp70; six were up-regulated and three were down-regulated . hsp <dig> has been shown to function as a chaperonin in the assembly of mitochondrial enzyme complexes composed of proteins encoded by nuclear genes and imported from the cytosol  <cit> . all  <dig> hsp <dig> genes were down-regulated in both in ht and fs. in general, the hsp unigenes did not exhibit regular changes. it is here assumed that the hsp unigenes maintain high expression levels prior to frequent habitat changes to allow the organism to acclimate to the intertidal environment.table  <dig>

histones in response to temperature stresses
histones are basic proteins that package dna into nucleosomes, and histone gene expression is closely correlated with the cell cycle and cell proliferation  <cit> . it has been reported that histone genes are repressed by cold stress  <cit> . some researchers believe that, at cooler temperatures, h2a.z occupancy represses gene expression by creating a physical block to transcription or by preventing the binding of complexes that activate transcription  <cit> . cs treatment showed less histone expression than nt, but fs treatment showed no differently expressed unigenes that encoded histone. a unigene encoding histone acetyltransferase complex was found to be up-regulated and a unigene encoding histone deacetylase complex that was found to be down-regulated . histone acetylation and deacetylation processes occur at specific lysine residues within the n-terminal. one theory suggests that ethanoyl is electronegative and can neutralize the electropositivity of histones. consequently, ethanoyl can reduce the affinity of histones and dna, which is electronegative. in this way, the acetylation of histone can lose nucleosomes in order to activate transcription. in the heat treatment,  <dig> histone unigenes including h2a, h2b, h <dig>  and h <dig> were found to be up-regulated.table  <dig>

multi-protein bridging factor and transcription factors
multiprotein bridging factor  <dig>  is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator involved in the regulation of diverse processes, such as endothelial cell differentiation, histidine metabolism, hormone-regulated lipid metabolism, and central nervous system development  <cit> . mbf <dig> functions up-stream of salicylic acid, trehalose, and ethylene during high-temperature stress by causing the accumulation of numerous transcription factors and transcription products of signal transduction genes  <cit> . in the current study, the expression of mbf was higher in ht but remained unchanged under cold stress , which suggests that cold stress had little effect on the expression patterns of pymbf <dig>  a similar result was reported in a previous study which found that pymbf <dig> transcripts are up-regulated in p. yezoensis cells during exposure to oxidative and heat stresses, and that the heat activation of pymbf <dig> requires membrane fluidization  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> zn-finger protein unigenes were up-regulated. these are believed to be controlled by mbf <dig> at the transcriptional level during high-temperature stress. in arabidopsis thaliana, mbf1c acts as a transcriptional regulator. it binds dna and controls the expression of  <dig> different transcripts during heat stress, including the important transcriptional regulator dre-binding protein 2a , two heat shock transcription factors , and several zinc finger proteins  <cit> . the current work suggests that pymbf <dig> plays a role in the oxidative and heat stress response pathways in p. yezoensis.

transcription factors, as key regulators of gene expression can be found in any organism. these factors act downstream of signaling cascades related to biological and environmental stimuli. in this study, transcription factors played an important role in response to temperature stresses. five up-regulated bzip unigenes were detected in ht and two down-regulated bzip unigenes were detected in cs. the expression of myb was higher in cs. two tf families, bzip and myb, are involved in aba signaling and its gene activation, which plays a vital role in plant stress responses  <cit> . myb proteins are key to regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . it has been suggested that myb <dig> is part of a complex network of transcription factors that control the expression of cbfs and other genes in response to cold stress  <cit> .

programmed cell death in response to high-temperature stress
in unicellular organisms, programmed cell death  is a protective action that keeps their cellular best adapted to survival under stress conditions. it may also serve as a possible mechanism for managing cell cycles and differentiation  <cit> . caspases are cysteine proteases that are important regulators of pcd in animals. plant genomes do not contain structural homologs of caspases. instead, they encode several related proteins, called metacaspases. these are also present in other organisms such as fungi, parasitic protozoa, and some bacteria  <cit> . metacaspases are suggested to be the ancestors of metazoan caspases, and plant metacaspases have previously been shown to be genuine cysteine proteases that automatically process their substrates in a manner similar to that of caspases  <cit> . many studies have been performed to explore the role of metacaspases in pcd. in arabidopsis, metacaspases atmc <dig> and atmc <dig> were found to mediate pcd  <cit> . in yeast cells, metacaspases are involved in pcd when the yeast cells suffer different extracellular stresses such as viral infections and heat shock  <cit> . up until now, there have been only a few studies on the relationship between metacaspases and pcd in algae in response to temperature, for example, shifting symbiodinium microadriaticum from  <dig> to 32°c resulted in an increase in mortality, an increase in caspase 3-like activity, and an increase in nitric oxide  production  <cit> . in the current work, four unigenes encoding metacaspase were found to be up-regulated under high-temperature stress, but none were found in other treatment groups, from which it can be inferred that the overexpression of the genes encoding metacaspases played an important role in p. yezoensis acclimation to heat stress. it has been reported that pcd is a central theme during plant reproductive development, and precise control of pcd execution, or its prevention, are intimately linked with successful plant reproduction  <cit> . sexual reproduction could be accelerated in an elevated temperature and light climates; in sargassum horneri it occurred at least  <dig> months earlier than in the wild  <cit> . this inspired the present investigation of the expression of genes encoding metacaspases activated under high-temperature stress conditions to regulate the progress of development, accelerating the formation of generative cell in p. yezoensis.

chloroplast genes in response to high-temperature stress
under high-temperature treatment conditions, the chloroplast genes encoding 3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase  <dig>  photosystem i subunit xi, photosystem ii  <dig> kda protein, ribosomal protein l <dig>  and ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase were significantly down-regulated relative to the 8°c group, indicating that less photosynthesis was taking place. photosystem ii  is one of the most thermosensitive components of photosynthesis and psi activity is much more heat stable than psii. the two factors that make psii electron transport most susceptible to heat stress are  increases in the fluidity of thylakoid membranes at high temperature which causes psii light harvesting complexes to become dislodged from the thylakoid membrane and  dependence of psii integrity on electron dynamics  <cit> . research on p. tenera may provide support for the current finding that the gross photosynthesis for the gametophytes of p. tenera were determined over a temperature range of 8–34°c. this showed that the gross photosynthetic rates of  <dig>  μmol o <dig> mgchl-a−1 min− <dig> was highest at  <dig>  :  <dig> – <dig> °c)  <cit> . it was here assumed that p. yezoensis resists high-temperature stress by inhibiting photosynthesis, as has been found in p. haitanensis  <cit> .

role of hormones in response to temperature stress in p. yezoensis
a growing body of evidence suggests that plants use endogenous hormones to couple their growth rate to temperature rather than subject themselves to temperature-induced inhibition of growth  <cit> . although abscisic acid  contains  <dig> carbon atoms, it is formed in two different ways, directly from the c <dig> sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate , which is the direct pathway, and formed by cleavage of c <dig> carotenoids originating from the mep pathway, which is considered the indirect pathway  <cit> . in pyropia, abscisic acid has been detected using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  <cit> . here, transcriptome data were searched for unigenes related to the biosynthesis of abscisic acid to determine which pathway p. yezoensis took to synthesize abscisic acid. there was one unigene encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, which acts in the direct pathway, but no unigenes related to the indirect pathway were found, not even 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase , which cleaves carotenoid precursors to produce xanthoxin, which can subsequently be converted into aba  <cit> . for this reason, it was inferred that the direct pathway was active in p. yezoensis, as in the green algae dunaliella  <cit>  and in fungi, cercospora cruenta  <cit> . this is not the preferred pathway of category higher plants, however  <cit> . in addition, the unigene encoding farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase was up-regulated in cs. from this, it was inferred that the concentration of abscisic acid increased to acclimate to temperature in fs. in many studies, abscisic acid biosynthesis was found to be an essential requirement for cold acclimatization and acquired thermotolerance  <cit> . the overexpression of abscisic acid insensitive  <dig>  confers increased freezing tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated the usefulness of the digital gene expression approach to identify the differentially expressed genes of p. yezoensis under different temperature treatments. first, in response to high temperature stress, p. yezoensis showed a constitutive gene expression profile different from that of other treatments, but the two low temperature stresses  were similar. under heat stress, unigenes related to replication and repair of dna and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum showed an up-regulated trend. more unigenes related to carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism were up-regulated under low-temperature stress conditions than at normal temperatures. the mechanisms involved in temperature response were demonstrated from the following perspectives: membrane fluidity, histones, pcd, photosynthesis, and transcription factors. a large number of genes of unknown function showed significant variations in expression under temperature stress, providing a new and valuable clue for future research into mechanisms by which p. yezoensis tolerates the unique environment of the intertidal zone.
