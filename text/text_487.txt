BACKGROUND
the emergence of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  has become an important threat to global health. cpe are primarily recognized in health care settings  <cit> , with the prevalence from clinical samples increasing globally . outcomes of cpe infections are poor, where mortality associated with infections can reach over 40 %  <cit> . with the widespread dissemination of extended-spectrum β-lactamases, carbapenems are the last class of safe and effective antimicrobials for treating multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections, the effectiveness of which has been greatly undermined by cpe  <cit> . as a result, there is a pressing need to understand the transmission pathways of carbapenemases to inform infection control, the main intervention available against cpe transmission and infection.

new delhi metallo-β-lactamase  was first described in  <dig> in a swedish traveler returning from the indian subcontinent  <cit> . since then, blandm has been documented in all continents, with the earliest blandm archived sample from  <dig>  <cit> . compared with other carbapenemases, blandm spread is characterized by alarming public health features, including:  broad gram-negative bacterial host range, including highly-virulent bacteria such as vibrio cholera and shigella boydii  <cit> ;  frequent acquisition among escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, which are gram-negative species carried as gut flora and able to survive in the inanimate environment;  widespread presence in the indian subcontinent, southeast and east asia, home to a large proportion of the global human population; and  co-carriage with other resistance genes on the blandm-bearing plasmid  <cit> .

multiple seminal investigations have focused on determining international and local transmission patterns of chromosome-mediated antimicrobial resistance . however, there remained many unanswered questions concerning the spread of plasmid-borne antimicrobial resistant genes. while mass global travel and widespread antibiotic use have been widely recognized as population risk factors associated with the dispersal of blandm  <cit> , little is known regarding the genomic factors associated with its rapid spread  <cit> . antimicrobial resistance genes are often carried by mobile genetic elements like plasmids and transposons  <cit> , which may also carry integrons or other gene mobilization elements  <cit> . a key biologic challenge in understanding plasmid-borne gene molecular epidemiology is its capability to exploit three tiers of gene spread:  inter-plasmid gene module transposition;  inter-bacterial plasmid conjugation; and  bacterial spread among humans, animals and the environment  <cit> . while single nucleotide polymorphism -based phylogenetic methods have been successful in understanding the transmission of chromosome-mediated antimicrobial resistance, these methods are ill-suited to determining the dynamics of multi-tiered gene flow of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance due to the lack of conserved genomic regions across the spectrum of diverse plasmids.

by moving beyond conventional snp-based phylogenetic study to a plasmid clustering approach based on distances measured by the degree of gene sharing and similarity of shared genes between different plasmids, we analyzed a combined collection of all genbank complete plasmid sequences within gram-negative bacteria hosts, thus having an unprecedented opportunity to profile the global dissemination of this important resistance gene. a total of  <dig> complete plasmid sequences from ncbi genbank database were included in this study, of which  <dig> are blandm-positive. this provided a comprehensive description on the distribution and genetic movement of blandm. moreover, in order to investigate local transmission of blandm, we sequenced  <dig> blandm-positive cpe isolates in our institute  <cit> , of which transmission pattern was inferred based on the identity of blandm-positive plasmids and phylogenetic study of the chromosomes, in combination with the patients’ records. in summary, our study suggested that blandm-positive plasmid diversity is very low in a local singapore hospital context. analyzing the  <dig> blandm-positive cpe isolated from the hospital showed that blandm spread was predominantly characterized by plasmid conjugation and bacterial transmission. in contrast, the blandm-positive plasmid is highly variable in global setting, due to the transposition of the blandm gene cassette into different plasmids. furthermore, our analysis revealed that blandm-positive plasmids worldwide can be further clustered into  <dig> distinct clusters correlated with plasmid incompatibility group and geographical distribution. our findings advance understanding of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance spread both locally and globally.

methods
clinical isolates
tan tock seng hospital  is singapore’s second largest acute-care hospital with  <dig> clinical and allied health departments and more than  <dig> beds. the first case of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae  in ttsh was detected in september  <dig> . following the index case, cpe was detected in another  <dig> patients. among these  <dig> patients,  <dig> shared a ward with the index patient during time at risk , while the other  <dig> were detected via their clinical cultures. all the enterobacteriaceae isolates from these cpe-positive patients were found to harbor blandm. the infection control response to a new blandm-positive patient detected in the course of routine testing included strict isolation of the index patient, contact tracing within the same ward and in previously admitted wards, and screening of these contacts with rectal swabs for cpe carriage using draft guidelines issued by cdc. age, gender, travel history, history of ward locations and clinical diagnoses were collected by retrospective case-chart review.

in this hospital laboratory, species identification of enterobacteriaceae was done using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry  and initial susceptibility testing was performed with vitek  <dig> automated system  or using kirby-bauer method; susceptibility was defined according to the breakpoints of the clinical and laboratory standard institute . additional minimum inhibitory concentration  testing using e-test strips  was done for all enterobateriaceae isolates which were found to be non-susceptible to imipenem or meropenem on mueller-hinton plates; those isolates with a mic ≥  <dig> mgs/l were investigated further. characterization of β-lactamase genes was performed by a polymerase chain reaction  assay targeting three carbapenemases with potential for rapid spread: blandm- <dig>  <cit> , blakpc  <cit>  and blaoxa-48-like  <cit> .

dna sequencing and genome assembly of clinical isolates
whole genome sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform  as detailed before  <cit> . sequence reads have been submitted to the european nucleotide archive  under accession prjeb <dig>  de novo assembly was performed using velvet  <cit> , parameters of which were optimized by velvetoptimiser  with k-mer lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  for all of the  <dig> isolates, velvetoptimizer achieved the best assembly at the k-mer length of  <dig> 

species identification for each isolate was performed using blast to search the assembled contigs in ncbi nt database. if the top five blast results for a contig are from chromosomal dna, these chromosomal genomes would be considered as candidate chromosomes for the isolate. for each isolate, each candidate chromosomes would be used as the reference sequence, against which all the contigs would be aligned. the genome coverage by the contigs would then be calculated, where the candidate chromosome with the highest genome coverage would be taken as the most similar bacterial strain and its species would be identified as the bacterial species of the isolate. multi-locus sequence type  databases for e. coli  and k. pneumonia were downloaded from pubmlst.org  <cit> , bmc bioinformatics and the assembled contigs were search against the gene alleles to infer mlst.

molecular epidemiology
sequence reads were aligned to the reference genome  using bwa  <cit> . single-nucleotide variants were called using samtools  <cit> . positions with less than  <dig> reads or with a minor allele frequency larger than  <dig>  would be marked as ‘unknown’ data. variants would then be called if the alternate allele frequency is above  <dig> . maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using raxml  <cit>  where a substitution model of gtrgamma was used and rapid bootstrap analysis was conducted on  <dig> runs. neighbor-joining trees were constructed using mega <dig>  <cit> , where evolutionary distances were computed using the kimura 2-parameter method and bootstrap test was conducted on  <dig> replicates.

blandm-positive plasmid identification
for each isolate, the contig with the blandm gene was first identified and extracted, after which the contig sequence was searched in the ncbi nt database for complete plasmid sequences with more than  <dig> base-pair identity. the similar complete plasmid sequences were then each used as the reference genome, against which all the contigs were aligned to calculate the sequence coverage by the contigs. the complete sequences with the highest sequence coverage would then be taken as the most similar plasmids.

plasmid mapping, genome coverage calculation and variant calling
novoalign was used for reads mapping against a reference plasmid sequence, after which indel realignment was conducted with gatk indelrealigner  <cit> , and the coverage was calculated with gatk depthofcoverage. variants were called with unifiedgenotyper in gatk, with filtering criteria: ″mq <  <dig> , qd <  <dig> , fs >  <dig> , haplotypescore >  <dig> ″.

conjugation assay
conjugation assays were performed using each of the  <dig> clinical isolates and an azide-resistant e. coli j <dig> as previously described  <cit> . to test the possibility of in vivo horizontal gene transfer in subject  <dig>  conjugation assay was repeated by mixing donor k. pneumoniae isolates  with the recipient strain . e. coli trans-conjugants were selected using selective agar  supplemented with meropenem .

complete plasmid sequences
all the  <dig> available complete plasmid sequences within gram-negative bacterial host in the ncbi plasmid database  were downloaded for analysis, of which  <dig> are blandm-positive. information on sampling location and date, sample source, subject’s travel history, host bacterial species and bacterial anti-microbial resistance phenotypes were obtained from genbank entries or accompanying peer-reviewed references cited in genbank.

plasmid clustering
the plasmid clustering was conducted based on the virtual hybridization method as described by zhou et al.  <cit>  to investigate the similarity of the diverse complete plasmid sequences.

for each plasmid, all coding dna sequences, as determined by original investigators, were downloaded from ncbi. duplicate genes on the same plasmid, defined as coding dna sequences having similarity value  above  <dig> , were removed. this resulted in a set of  <dig>  genes. additionally, insertion sequences within each plasmid were detected using is finder  with default parameters at a cut-off e-value of 1e− <dig>  which identified  <dig> unique insertion sequences.

for genetic sequence comparison, a similarity score is calculated as 2**/. the  <dig> complete plasmid sequences were then compared using nucleotide blast algorithm against each of the  <dig>  genes and  <dig> insertion sequences to calculate a similarity score, which resulted in a  <dig> by  <dig>  matrix of similarity scores. a hypothetical plasmid sequence with all similarity scores set to zero was used as outgroup.

to achieve computational tractability,  <dig> random matrices were generated, each of which was composed of 20 % of the similarity score matrix’s columns that were randomly selected without replacement, showing the similarity scores represented by the 20 % of the randomly selected genes or insertion sequences. for each matrix of similarity scores, pair-wise euclidean distances between plasmid sequences were calculated and formulated into a distance matrix, after which a neighbor-joining tree was constructed with the ‘neighbor’ program in phylip  <cit> . a consensus tree was constructed using the ‘consense’ program in phylip with the majority rule as the consensus type.

blandm-positive plasmid clusters based on the consensus tree were defined using a stringent criterion of at least  <dig> unique blandm-positive plasmids, with all nodes having ≥99 % support at  <dig> bootstraps.

phylogenetic tree for cluster refinement
cluster refinement was conducted for each cluster respectively. for each cluster, coding dna sequences present in all plasmid sequences with a nucleotide blast e-value less than 1e− <dig> and an identity above 80 % were extracted, aligned and concatenated. the phylogenetic trees were built for each cluster similarly as in the molecular epidemiology study.

incompatibility groups of plasmids
plasmid incompatibility  groups were assessed using plasmidfinder from the center for genomic epidemiology  with default settings  <cit> .

comparative genomics
to compare the plasmids, complete plasmid sequences and their corresponding gene features were first downloaded from ncbi genbank. the annotated plasmid sequences were then compared and visualized with the artemis comparison tool act  <cit> .

RESULTS

the first  <dig> cpe isolates from  <dig> patients in a single singapore hospital were isolated, of which the patient demographics and sample features are summarized in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  the median duration of hospitalization to positive cpe culture was 3 days . six patients  had blandm detected on clinical cultures. one patient  was co-infected with  <dig> cpe isolates, where  <dig> different strains of enterobacteriaceae were isolated from the patient’s stool and urine samples, respectively. of the  <dig> patients, only two had travelled out of singapore in the past 2 years, including subject  <dig>  who had travelled to australia and subject  <dig>  who had travelled to malaysia. whole genome sequencing was conducted on illumina miseq, with the sequencing statistics summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> patient demographics and sample features

plasmid identification was conducted with de novo assembly in combination with blandm-positive plasmid identification, plasmid mapping and genome coverage calculation as elaborated in the methods. the de novo assembly statistics were summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  among the  <dig> samples,  <dig> blandm-positive plasmids were identified, of which  <dig> were identified as ptr <dig> ,  <dig> was identified as pndm-kn  with the last being identified as pndm_mgr <dig>  . plasmid identification was most confident for the  <dig>  base-pair plasmid ptr <dig>  and the  <dig>  base-pair plasmid pndm_mgr <dig> . the  <dig>  base-pair plasmid pndm-kn was identified in sample kp-u- <dig> with  <dig>  % genome coverage at very high read depths. no blandm-positive plasmid was detected in sample ec-u- <dig>  the genome coverages and the read depths were summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and table s <dig>  respectively.

variant calling was performed for the  <dig> samples containing ptr <dig>  the most prevalent blandm-positive plasmid, to compare the ptr <dig> plasmid sequences in respective samples with the reference ptr <dig> sequence . inspection of the variants revealed that  <dig> ptr <dig> plasmid sequences were identical to the reference ptr <dig> sequence, while one ptr <dig> plasmid sequence had only one snp compared to the reference ptr <dig> sequence. in en-u- <dig> , the ptr <dig> sequence had one synonymous mutation at the coding region of a putative transposase , resulting a codon change of gcc → gct.

these results showed that local blandm-positive plasmids had limited diversity with the majority of the plasmids being identical copies of ptr <dig>  which is a strong indication of clonal plasmid spread. the other two blandm-positive plasmids had identities of pndm-kn and pndm_mgr <dig>  the major difference between the three plasmids  strongly indicated independent plasmid introductions into the hospital ecology.

bacterial host range at the local level
the bacterial species harboring blandm-positive plasmids were: e. coli , k. pneumoniae  and enterobacter cloacae  . of the  <dig> e. coli isolates,  <dig> were most similar to st <dig> e. coli strain na <dig> , while the remaining isolates were most similar to st <dig> e. coli strain apec o <dig> , st <dig> strain umn <dig>  and st <dig> strain iai <dig> . for the k. pneumoniae isolates, three k. pneumoniae strains were identified to be similar, including: st <dig> strain hs <dig> , st <dig> strain ntuh-k <dig>  and st <dig> strain  <dig> . consistent with previous report  <cit> , there appeared to be no evidence of association between enterobacteriaceae host species and specific plasmid identities.

maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for bacteria chromosomes respectively for e. coli  and k. pneumoniae , and were supported by neighbor-joining trees in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  phylogenetic trees for both e. coli and k. pneumoniae displayed significant diversity. the diversity of bacterial strains harboring ptr <dig> highlighted the propensity of blandm-positive plasmids to spread via inter-bacterial plasmid conjugation, and would explain a key challenge in relying upon bacterial phylogenetic analysis alone to understand blandm dissemination.fig.  <dig> whole-genome phylogenetic tree of local bla
ndm-positive bacteria. maximum likelihood trees were constructed based on sequence alignments of e. coli  and k. pneumoniae . jj <dig> and hs <dig> are the reference genomes for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. the branch lengths were calculated by raxml and reflect the number of expected mutations per site. bootstrap values are in a scale of 0– <dig>  and are shown at each node in grey




inter- and intra- patient bacterial spread at the local level
phylogenetic trees of the bacteria chromosomes in fig.  <dig> suggested clonal bacterial spread in  <dig> instances. the first instance involved st <dig> e. coli detected in  <dig> patients – subjects  <dig> and  <dig>  which clustered tightly as ec-u- <dig> and ec-r- <dig> in fig. 2a and differs by only  <dig> snps. the limited number of snps identified thereby suggested inter-patient bacterial spread.

the other two instances involved bacteria with identical sequence types isolated from different body sites in the same patient . kp-u- <dig>  and kp-r- <dig>  were both st <dig> k. pneumoniae that harbored the ptr <dig> plasmid, which clustered tightly in fig. 2b with  <dig> snps. ec-u- <dig>  and ec-r- <dig>  are both st <dig> e. coli that clustered tightly in fig. 2a with  <dig> snps. sample ec-u- <dig> was blandm-negative and positive for blaimp- <dig>  a class b carbapenemase. in vitro trans-conjugation assays demonstrated the ability of ptr <dig> to conjugate from k. pneumoniae to e. coli. mating assays with ptr3-positive k. pneumoniae from subject  <dig> as the donor and azide-resistant e. coli j <dig> as the recipient demonstrated ptr <dig> plasmid was self-conjugative . subject  <dig>  as a result, represents a possible case of intra-host conjugation.

as discussed, the ptr <dig> plasmids remained 100 % identical in all but  <dig> isolate at the nucleotide level in scenarios of inter- and intra-patient bacterial transfer, and inter-bacterial plasmid conjugation within the same host. these results suggested early spread of endemic plasmids at the local level was predominantly clonal.

clustering of global plasmids from gram-negative bacterial host
complete genomic sequences of  <dig> plasmids within gram-negative bacterial hosts were downloaded from the ncbi database. the median plasmid sequence length is  <dig>  base-pairs , with the median number of genes annotated per plasmid being  <dig> . out of the  <dig> plasmids, the majority belong to the enterobacteriaceae family , followed by spirochaetaceae , rhodobacteraceae , moraxellaceae , and others .

out of the  <dig> plasmid sequences belonging to gram-negative bacteria,  <dig> sequences were found to be blandm-positive . these plasmids were sampled from all continents except antarctica over an 8 year period . thirty-eight of the  <dig> blandm-positive plasmid samples have a human origin, while one sample has an environmental origin. the median plasmid sequence length for blandm-positive plasmids is  <dig>  base-pairs , with the median number of genes annotated per plasmid being  <dig> .

while construction of a snp-based phylogenetic tree is the most common method to investigate evolutionary relationships among groups of organisms or strains, it is not applicable to plasmid phylogenetic study as there is no common genomic region shared among all the  <dig> complete plasmid sequences. an alternative approach based on the relative distances measured by the degree of gene sharing and the similarity of shared genes has been applied to cluster the plasmids. the pair-wise distances based on a total of  <dig>  genes and  <dig> insertion sequences present in at least  <dig> plasmid were calculated as elaborated in the methods, resulting in a euclidean-distance derived distance matrix. a neighbor-joining tree was constructed with the distance matrix, upon which clustering analyses were based . the clustering of global plasmid showed high global plasmid diversity with blandm-positive plasmids located in different clusters.fig.  <dig> clustering of global plasmids in gram-negative bacteria hosts. the neighbor-joining tree consisting of  <dig> gram-negative plasmid sequences was constructed to reflect the gene composition similarity of the plasmids. seven bla
ndm-positive plasmid phylogenetic clusters were identified using stringent criteria . clusters with bla
ndm-positive plasmids are indicated with dots that are colored distinctively with blue , purple , green , magenta , orange , grey  and red 



clustering and phylogenetic study of blandm-positive plasmids
seven clusters  were identified to contain blandm-positive plasmids, which range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> plasmids. for better clarity, the plasmids within the seven clusters and the clusters near the seven clusters were extracted to construct a new neighbor-joining tree with the plasmids’ information summarized . the plasmids within the seven clusters were extracted and a new neighbor-joining tree was constructed, which is presented as fig.  <dig> with the plasmids’ information.fig.  <dig> clustering of bla

the number of shared regions increased markedly for plasmids within the same cluster, allowing for the construction of a phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequence alignment within the shared regions. for clusters with more than three sequences, a concatenated alignment of the homologous sequences was generated, after which a phylogenetic tree would be constructed to study the phylogenetic relationship . the concatenated sequences within each cluster showed great similarity to each other, as can be identified by the short branch lengths.

while the distance-based clustering method provided a tree based on the gene composition similarity, the cluster refinement phylogenetic tree used snps to investigate the evolutionary relationship within each cluster, which were similar in topology with the clustering method.

global blandm-positive plasmid diversity: gene transposition
at least  <dig> events in the  <dig> clusters  of blandm-positive plasmids have been observed to indicate independent recombination events introducing blandm into different plasmid backbones of blandm-negative plasmids with subsequent evolution and spread .fig.  <dig> acquisition of bla

in the process of adaptive evolution, diversity of the microbial genome is primarily driven by recombination or point mutations  <cit> . as the clustering approach made use of plasmid gene composition diversity arising through recombination rather than point mutations, our findings suggested the blandm-positive plasmids have undergone extensive mobile genetic element transposition to adapt to varying environmental niches. as mentioned earlier, there was minimal intra-cluster snp difference, suggesting that polymorphisms due to point mutations play minimal role to account for the diversity of the plasmids.

transpositions facilitated by transposons , insertion sequences  elements and is common region  are detected frequently in plasmids that involve antimicrobial genes, non-antimicrobial genes and transposable genetic elements. with respect to the blandm gene, transposition mechanism involving blandm was discernible by comparative genomics in  <dig> instances: pndm_hn <dig>  , pndm-om  , pecndm   and pndm-btr  . the tn <dig> composite transposon platform has been theorized to be the original vehicle to mobilize blandm among acinetobacter species. our results reveal that blandm introductions also occurred in the context of iscr1-mediated transposition, fipa gene hotspot recombination and tn1548-borne class i integron recombination. larger datasets of genomic sequences involving blandm-positive and negative nearest neighbors will enhance the understanding of blandm transposition globally.

global blandm-positive plasmid diversity: incompatibility group and geographical distribution
the plasmid clustering based on gene composition diversity tends to cluster the plasmids with the same backbone together, thus showing a clear clustering of the plasmid inc groups for enterobacteriaceae plasmids: plasmids in c <dig> are all inc x plasmids, plasmids in c <dig> are inc l/m, plasmids in c <dig> are inc a/c, plasmids in c <dig> and c <dig> are inc f, while plasmids in c <dig> are inc nii .

the plasmid clusters also showed some association with geographical distributions. some clusters were spreading mainly via regional transmission to date:  c <dig>  a cluster of plasmids acinetobacter sp. host, is limited to south asia and east asia;  c <dig> and c <dig> are limited to south and east asia; and  c <dig> was found in southeast asia and oceania. other clusters  had wider geographic dispersion involving south asia, east asia, middle east, north america, africa and europe.

local blandm-positive plasmid in the global context
as detailed in the global analysis, ptr <dig> clustered tightly with p271a , a plasmid described in australia . the other two plasmids located in different plasmid clusters: pndm-kn is in c <dig>  and pndm_mgr <dig> is in c <dig>  in contrast to global plasmid diversity, the presence of near identical ptr <dig> plasmids in  <dig> out of  <dig> local samples suggested the blandm-positive plasmid diversity at the local level to be very low. on the other hand, the  <dig> non-ptr <dig> plasmids, which were related to different plasmid clusters in the global plasmid phylogeny, were detected each in only one patient, which suggested independent plasmid introductions into the hospital ecology.

discussion
by analyzing whole genome sequencing data of  <dig> blandm-positive cpe isolated in a local hospital and  <dig> complete plasmid sequences  in the ncbi database, we investigated the local transmission and global dissemination of the blandm gene. our analysis has highlighted the complex genetic pathways of blandm spread. globally, blandm spread involved marked plasmid diversity with no predominant bacterial clone. the blandm-positive plasmids were carried by multiple species of acinetobacter and enterobacteriaceae, thereby highlighting the propensity for conjugation of blandm-positive plasmids among different bacterial species. the blandm gene module mobilized between different plasmid backbones on at least  <dig> independent occasions. in contrast to global plasmid diversity, early local spread of blandm-positive plasmids in a single singapore hospital was characterized by clonal spread of a predominant plasmid ptr <dig> with  <dig> sporadic instances of plasmid introduction .

the plasmid clustering approach is crucial to our current analysis as it allows quantitative analyses of plasmid molecular epidemiology involving a large number of diverse plasmids as a tool in analyzing global spread of plasmid-borne genes. prior genomic investigations of blandm spread have been mainly restricted to comparisons of less than  <dig> closely related plasmids due to the lack of phylogenetic congruence, and hence have not been able to discern the patterns of blandm-positive plasmid clustering at a global level. the establishment of nearest-neighbor relationships facilitated the determination of transposition events involving genomic regions . determination of cluster relationships subsequently opened the ability to correlate clusters with specific phenotypes .

whole genome studies of successful bacterial clones have been used to understand transmission of chromosomally-mediated antimicrobial resistant bacteria, for example mrsa. however, prior studies relying upon bacteria chromosomes to understand blandm transmission have been hindered by the diversity of bacterial species and strains harboring blandm, even in a single geographic local  <cit> . the current study highlighted three vital evolutionary mechanisms underlying blandm-positive bacteria diversity:  blandm-gene module transposition,  blandm-positive plasmid conjugation, and  blandm-positive bacterial spread. future studies of blandm transmission would have to take into account these three levels of gene spread.

gene module transposition was a vital factor in the successful spread of blandm for at least three reasons:  mobilization of blandm from acinetobacter sp. plasmids to enterobacteriaceae plasmids, as recognized before;  mobilization of blandm among enterobacteriaceae plasmids of differing inc groups; and  non-blandm gene movement facilitating adaptation of plasmids to differing selection pressures.

it is well accepted that certain plasmid inc groups can be stably maintained only in closely related bacterial hosts, while others have the ability to replicate in a broader host range  <cit> . in our study, we noted an association between plasmid inc groups and geographical spread of the blandm-positive plasmids. specifically, broad-host-range  plasmid families  were associated with transcontinental spread of blandm in asia, north america, africa and europe. in contrast, narrow-host-range plasmids families  had limited spread within the region. this suggested that inc type contributes to the emergence and global spread of the blandm gene, as supported by multiple earlier studies. laboratory experiments have showed that bhr plasmids evolved various strategies that enable them to replicate autonomously in much wider range of phylogenetically distinct hosts  <cit> . these plasmid types, being well adapted to different bacterial hosts , endowed with efficient conjugative system  promoted the spread of blandm by enabling its stable maintenance in novel bacterial hosts or ecological niches, often independently from the presence of antimicrobial selection  <cit> . collectively, our data suggested that plasmid types, especially those of bhr, play an essential role in plasmid adaptation by improving their stability for long-term persistence in bacterial communities of clinical and natural habitats. a limitation of the global plasmid-based inferences based on the current data is the limited number of samples and potential bias in sample selection, a limitation common for all studies leveraging on public databases. larger studies with diverse sampling populations would help to address sampling bias.

local blandm spread in a single singapore hospital context was characterized predominantly by conjugation of a clonal plasmid  between enterobacteriaceae , and inter-human host blandm-positive bacterial transmission . the finding of the ptr <dig> plasmid in  <dig> distinct k. pneumoniae strains in another singapore hospital further supported a significant role of inter-human host transmission and clonal plasmid conjugation in local spread. three recent publications using whole genome sequencing also reported the predominant role of inter-human host transmission  and horizontal gene transfer in local hospital spread of carbapenemases .

one potential reason for the difference in the local and the global plasmid diversity is the sampling and the time period. while the  <dig> global complete blandm-positive plasmid sequences has a long time range of eight years, the  <dig> local isolates were isolated within a one-year period.

an important limitation of this study and others of its kind is the inevitable bias that comes with selecting isolates. to minimize this inherent limitation, we included all blandm plasmid sequenced at the point of study, spanning a period of almost 8 years from  <dig> to  <dig> , covering  <dig> continents. proportionally, a larger majority  of the samples came from human origin, while blandm has been reported to present in livestocks and environment in high prevalence. however, this would not inherently influence the results of this study, that is, linking phenotype  with plasmid characteristics .

our current analysis offers a glimpse of the genetic armamentarium available to blandm for dissemination to multiple environments. the limited data available for understanding transmission of this important resistance gene is highlighted by availability of only approximately  <dig> blandm-positive and  <dig> gram-negative whole-plasmid sequences globally. whole genome sequencing of blandm-positive isolates from diverse geographies on a much larger scale will definitely increase understanding of blandm evolution and spread, and may prove crucial to long-term control of ndm.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis has revealed the complex genetic pathways of blandm spread, where the global dissemination is mainly characterized by transposition of the blandm gene cassette into different plasmids while early local transmission is mainly a result of plasmid conjugation and bacterial spread. our findings advance understanding of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance spread both locally and globally.
