BACKGROUND
enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli  is a major foodborne pathogen associated with frequent outbreaks of diarrheal disease. most individuals develop watery diarrhea and recover. however, about 15–20% cases may develop life-threatening bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . dissemination and contact of humans with ehec from multiple sources such as undercooked meats, raw fruits and vegetables, physical contact with ehec harboring animals further contribute to increased frequency of illness  <cit> .

ehec is usually ingested through contaminated food products. once inside the host, ehec traverses to colon and establishes itself in the distal ileum or large bowel. inside the colon, ehec is thought to use guided motility, provided by flagellar motion, to reach its preferred site of attachment  <cit> . autoinducer molecules  and hormones  induce various virulence factors and are speculated to help in attachment and subsequent infection process  <cit> . a two-component system qsebc  <cit>  induces flagellar operon in response to hormones and ai-2/ai- <dig>  resulting in increased and guided motility  <cit>  towards epithelial cell layer. upon encountering the epithelial cell layer, the flagella and other surface structures such as type  <dig> pili and hemorrhagic coli pilus help ehec to attach to the surface  <cit> . multiple environmental and genetic factors such as ph, hormones, signaling molecules as well as quorum sensing  regulate the expression of locus of enterocyte effacement  and flagellar operons  <cit> . the hormones and ai- <dig> also induce type iii secretion system  in ehec through qseef and qsead  <cit> . ttss is encoded in lee, which is organized in five operons lee1-lee <dig>  lee1-encoded regulator  is the first gene on lee <dig> operon and subject to modulation by various regulators. in turn, ler activates the transcription of the five operons  <cit> .

the ttss penetrates the host cell membrane and serves as conduit for injecting effector proteins. these effector proteins manipulate the host machinery including actin cytoskeleton, resulting in attaching and effacing lesions. some of the secreted effectors disrupt the tight junction leading to higher secretion of chloride ions and ultimately developing in diarrhea  <cit> . the phage encoded shiga toxin is the main virulence factor of ehec and other shiga toxin producing e. coli. the shiga toxin disrupts the protein synthesis in host epithelial cells causing necrosis and cell death  <cit> . additionally, shiga toxin travels to kidney through blood stream and damages renal endothelial cells inciting renal inflammation, potentially leading to hus  <cit> . along with the direct injury to epithelial cells, biofilms formed by pathogenic e. coli strains can pose serious health problems such as prostatitis, biliary tract infections, and urinary catheter cystitis  <cit> .

antibiotics and antidiarrheal drug therapy of ehec activates the stress response resulting in induction of phage lytic cycle and subsequent release of shiga toxin. the release of shiga toxin is directly correlated with increase in hus incidence  <cit> . at present, cdc recommends preventive measures such as washing hands and thorough cooking of meats etc. to control ehec infections. however, these preventive measures need to be supported with alternative strategies for prevention and control of ehec infections. a promising strategy is to identify anti-virulence agents, which may be used alone or in conjunction with antibiotic therapy  <cit> . anti-virulence agents target bacterial virulence determinants including toxin production, adhesion to host cells, specialized secretion systems such as ttss  <cit> . application of anti-virulence agents is speculated to allow host immune system to prevent or clear the bacterial infection. several synthetic and natural molecules with anti-virulence properties have been discovered  <cit>  and at least one molecule, led <dig>  was shown to be effective in animal models  <cit> . however, none of the molecules have entered wide-scale clinical trial as of yet, owing to various concerns such as their toxicity and safety. therefore, there is an urgent need to identify a more diverse pool of molecules with anti-virulence activities. availability of such a pool will ensure better drug designing strategies, to combat bacterial infections like ehec.

secondary metabolites produced by plants present very diverse scaffolds, which have been used for designing novel drugs including antimicrobials. in nature, secondary metabolites contribute to systemic and induced plant defense system against insect, bacterial and fungal infestation  <cit> . several secondary metabolites belonging to classes such as coumarins, flavonoids, terpenoids and alkaloids demonstrate inhibitory properties against numerous microorganisms. recently our group and others identified qs inhibitory properties of several plant secondary metabolites and extracts rich in phytochemicals  <cit> .

citrus species contain a unique class of secondary metabolites known as limonoids. chemically, limonoids are triterpenoids with relatively high degree of oxygenation  <cit> . several studies have reported anticancer, cholesterol lowering, antiviral and antifeedant activities of citrus limonoids  <cit> . recently, we demonstrated that certain limonoids such as obacunone, nomilin, isolimonic acid and ichangin interfere with qs in v. harveyi <cit> . in addition, obacunone and nomilin seems to modulate type iii secretion system  and biofilm formation in ehec and salmonella typhimurium  <cit> . the present work was carried out to understand effect of five citrus limonoids , viz. isolimonic acid, ichangin, isoobacunoic acid, isoobacunoic acid glucoside  and deacetyl nomilinic acid glucoside  on ehec biofilm and ttss.

growth and metabolic activity
the growth and metabolic activity of ehec was measured as previously described  <cit> . briefly, overnight cultures of ehec were diluted  <dig> fold in lb media. two hundred microliters of diluted cultures was placed in each well of 96-well plates and grown for  <dig> h at 37°c in presence of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml limonoids or equivalent volume of dmso. the plates were constantly shaken at medium speed in synergy™ ht multi-mode microplate reader . od <dig> was recorded every  <dig> min. metabolic activity of ehec was measured by adding alamarblue  and absorption at  <dig> and  <dig> nm was monitored in similar fashion as growth curve.

biofilm assay
ehec biofilms were grown in polystyrene 96-well plates by plating  <dig> μl/well of  <dig> fold diluted overnight cultures in presence of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml of limonoids at 26°c for  <dig> h without shaking  <cit> . for vs <dig>  and vs <dig>  biofilms were quantified after  <dig> h growth in 96-well plates. the biofilms were quantified by staining with  <dig> % crystal violet  for  <dig> min. extra stain was washed with phosphate buffer  and dye associated with attached biofilm was dissolved with dmso. an absorbance at  <dig> nm was used to quantify the total biofilm mass.

in vitro adhesion assay
human epithelial caco- <dig> cells were purchased from atcc  and maintained in dulbecco’s minimal essential medium  with nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. caco- <dig> cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well in 6-well plates and infected with approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well of freshly grown ehec atcc  <dig> in presence or absence of  <dig> μg/ml isolimonic acid, ichangin, isoobacunoic acid, ioag and dnag. the plates were incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c in 5% co <dig> environment. after completion of incubation, plates were washed 3× with sterile pbs to remove any loosely attached cells. caco- <dig> cells were lysed with  <dig> % triton-x in pbs to release the bacteria and serial dilutions were plated on lb-agar and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. colonies were counted after incubation period and presented as log10cfu/ml.

caco- <dig> cell survival assay
caco- <dig> cells  were seeded in 96-well plate and exposed to  <dig> μg/ml of isolimonic acid, ichangin, isoobacunoic acid, ioag and dnag for  <dig> h in humidified incubator at 5% co <dig>  37°c. cell survival was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase using cytotox-one™ homogeneous membrane integrity assay .

quantitative pcr
relative transcript amount of selected genes  was measured by qrt-pcr as described  <cit> . briefly, overnight cultures of ehec atcc  <dig> were diluted  <dig> fold with fresh lb medium or dmem+10% fbs , treated with limonoids  or dmso and grown further at 37°c,  <dig> rpm. bacterial cells were collected at od <dig> ≈ <dig> . rna was extracted using rneasy minikit  and converted to cdna using mulv reverse transcriptase enzyme and random hexamer in a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction   <cit>  at 42°c for  <dig> h. pcr products were purified with qiaquick pcr-purification kit . twenty five nanogram cdna from each sample was amplified with  <dig> pmol target primers using sybr green pcr master mix  for  <dig> amplification cycles. after completion of  <dig> pcr cycles, melt curve data was generated. all the measurements were done on three biological replicates consisting of three technical replicates each. amplification of target sequences was done on abi-prism  <dig> ht . the ct values for primers were normalized against that of 16s rrna. fold change in the gene expression was calculated by  <dig> <cit>  and expressed as fold change ±sd.

the underlined segment in av25/ <dig> and av29/ <dig> indicate the restriction enzyme sites.

ai- <dig> reporter assay
preconditioned media  was prepared as described  <cit> . overnight cultures of tevs <dig>  tevs <dig> and av <dig>  were diluted  <dig> fold in lb medium and grown till od <dig> ≈ <dig> . the cells were collected by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min and resuspended in either fresh lb media supplemented with  <dig> μm epinephrine or pm and treated with  <dig> μg/ml isolimonic acid or equivalent amount of dmso. the β-galactosidase activity was measured after  <dig> min incubation at 37°c using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as previously described  <cit>  and reported as mean ± sd of three replicates.

statistical analysis
percent inhibition of biofilm formation was calculated from three experiments consisting of three replicate wells using the formula 100- . effects of different limonoids for each activity were analyzed using analysis of variance  followed by tukey’s pairwise multiple comparison test on spss  <dig>  . the effect was considered significant at p < <dig> . the data for ehec biofilm was fitted to a 3-parameter sigmoid models y= a//b)) using sigmaplot  <dig>  . in order to conduct the analysis, concentration of each limonoids was converted to log <dig> μm and plotted against percent inhibition values.

RESULTS
effect of citrus limonoids on ehec growth and biofilm formation
the purity of all tested limonoids was >95% . furthermore, limonoids in the concentration range of  <dig> - <dig> μg/ml, did not affect ehec growth  and viability .

the mean ± sd of three replicates are presented.

all the five limonoids inhibit biofilm formation in concentration dependent manner . biofilm inhibitory activities of limonoids were compared by calculating ic <dig> values from 3-parameter sigmoid equations . the 3-parameter equation was chosen due to better fit demonstrated for  <dig> out of  <dig> limonoids. ic <dig> values were used for comparison because limonoids demonstrated <50% inhibition of biofilm formation. the r <dig> values for isolimonic acid, ichangin, isoobacunoic acid, ioag and dnag were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. isolimonic acid was the most potent inhibitor of biofilm formation among the tested limonoids with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm  followed by ichangin . ioag was more potent  than its aglycone isoobacunoic acid . furthermore, 95% confidence intervals for ic <dig> values were calculated as  <dig> - <dig>  μm ,  <dig> - <dig>  μm ,  <dig> - <dig>  μm ,  <dig> - <dig>  μm  and  <dig> - <dig>  μ m .

effect of limonoids on adhesion of ehec to caco- <dig> cells
to further understand the effect of limonoids, adherence of ehec to colon epithelial caco- <dig> cells was studied. isolimonic acid and ichangin  treatment significantly  reduced the number of ehec cells attached to caco- <dig> cells by  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml, respectively . isoobacunoic acid, ioag and dnag did not affect the number of ehec cells adhering to caco- <dig> cells. to determine, if the observed reduction in adhesion of ehec was due to reduced cell viability of caco- <dig> cells, survival of caco- <dig> in presence of  <dig> μg/ml limonoids at  <dig> h was assayed by measuring extracellular ldh. survival of caco- <dig> cells in presence of  <dig> μg/ml limonoids was similar to solvent control .

citrus limonoids repress the lee, flagellar and stx <dig> genes
adherence of ehec to epithelial cells is facilitated by several factors including locus of enterocyte effacement  encoded ttss, flagella, effector proteins and intimin  <cit> . to determine the probable mode of action, effect of limonoids on expression of six lee encoded genes ler, escu, escr , escj, sepz and cesd , flagellar master regulators flhdc and stx <dig> was studied. isolimonic acid and ichangin exerted the strongest effect on the lee in ehec grown to od <dig> ≈  <dig>  in lb media. the transcriptional regulator of lee, the ler, was repressed  <dig> fold by isolimonic acid, while other lee encoded genes were down-regulated by 6– <dig> fold . ichangin treatment resulted in ≈  <dig> - <dig> fold repression of lee encoded genes. ioag repressed the escu, escr, escj and cesd by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively while aglycone, isoobacunoic acid did not seem to affect the expression of lee encoded genes under investigation . similarly, dnag treatment did not resulted in differential expression of any genes. furthermore, isolimonic acid repressed the flhc and flhd by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively , while ichangin exposure resulted in  <dig>  fold repression of flhc and flhd. ioag repressed flhc and flhd by  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds, respectively. isoobacunoic acid and dnag treatment did not seem to modulate the expression of flhdc .

the ehec atcc  <dig> was grown to od600≈ <dig> , rna was extracted using rneasy kit and converted to cdna as described in text. target genes were amplified from three biological samples. fold change was calculated using  <dig> method and presented as mean ± sd of three replicates.

shiga toxin produced by ehec is responsible for hus  <cit> . we were further interested in learning if any of the limonoids modulate expression of stx <dig>  isolimonic acid and ichangin  repressed the stx <dig> by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively , while ioag, isoobacunoic acid and dnag did not seem to affect the expression of stx <dig> 

the culture of ehec in dmem was reported to activate lee expression  <cit> . to determine, if isolimonic acid represses lee under dmem growth conditions, expression of ler, stx <dig>  escj and sepz were measured. isolimonic acid treatment repressed ler, stx <dig>  escj and sepz in dmem media by > <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> fold whereas, expression of rpoa was unaffected . the escj and sepz, which are coded as a polycistronic message, demonstrated differing levels of regulation in presence of isolimonic acid . however, differential degradation and processing of genes encoded as polycistronic mrna is well documented  <cit> , and could potentially be the reason of different levels of mrna transcripts recorded for escj and sepz.

effect of isolimonic acid on ai-3/epinephrine induced lee expression
ai-3/epinephrine mediated cell-cell signaling regulates biofilm, motility and expression of lee in ehec  <cit> . to ascertain if isolimonic acid interferes with ai- <dig> signaling, reporter strains tevs <dig> and tevs <dig> were induced by pm in presence of  <dig> μg/ml isolimonic acid, and β-galactosidase activity was measured. tevs <dig> and tevs <dig> contain single copy operon fusions of lee1:lacz and lee2:lacz, respectively  <cit> . isolimonic acid treatment reduced the expression of lee <dig>  and lee <dig>  by  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . additionally, lee <dig> was stimulated by  <dig> μm epinephrine in presence or absence of  <dig> μg/ml isolimonic acid and β-galactosidase activity was measured. isolimonic acid repressed the epinephrine-induced expression of lee <dig> by ≈ <dig>  fold  .

qsebc dependent inhibition of biofilm by isolimonic acid
qsebc is a two component system, which detects ai- <dig> and epinephrine and modulates biofilm formation and flagellar expression  <cit> . as isolimonic acid seems to interfere with ai-3/epinephrine induced pathway, it was possible that this interference is dependent on qsebc. to determine if isolimonic acid inhibits ehec biofilm formation by affecting qsebc, biofilm formation in ehec 86– <dig>  qsec deletion mutant  and complemented strain vs <dig>  <cit>  was studied. since Δqsebc strain  did not form appreciable biofilm at  <dig> h, the biofilms were grown up to  <dig> h. the biofilm formation in Δqsebc at  <dig> h was similar between solvent control  and isolimonic acid  . in contrast, isolimonic acid reduced the biofilm formation by  <dig> % in complemented strain vs <dig>  to further understand the role of qsebc in wild type strain atcc  <dig>  plasmid pvs <dig> , was purified from vs <dig> and introduced into wild type strain. in addition, qseb and qsec were amplified from ehec genomic dna, cloned into pbad <dig> vector and introduced into ehec strain atcc  <dig>  the expression of qsebc/qseb/qsec was induced by addition of  <dig> % arabinose in the media. overexpression of qsebc/qsec/qseb formed significantly more biofilm, when compared to ehec wild type carrying vector alone . we further measured the effect of isolimonic acid on the biofilm formation in strains overexpressing qsebc/qsec/qseb . the isolimonic acid treatment did not significantly affect the biofilm formation, measured after  <dig> h of growth, in ehec strains overexpressing qsebc/qsec/qseb . furthermore, it was possible that isolimonic acid modulates the expression of qsebc leading to inhibition of biofilm. to determine the effect of isolimonic acid, expression of qseb and qsec was measured by qrt-pcr. the results indicate that isolimonic acid do not regulate the expression of qseb and qsec . altogether, finding of these experiments seem to suggest that isolimonic acid affects the qsebc activity but not the expression to inhibit biofilm formation.

qsea dependent inhibition of ler by isolimonic acid
repression of lee and interference of ai-3/epinephrine mediated signaling by isolimonic acid prompted us to investigate the role of qsea. to determine the contribution of qsea, change in ler expression was monitored in qsea deletion  and complemented  strains. isolimonic acid  treated cultures demonstrated a < <dig> fold change in ler expression in qsea deletion mutant. in comparison, isolimonic acid repressed the ler by  <dig>  fold in complemented strain vs <dig> . to further confirm the role of qsea, qsea was overexpressed by introducing the plasmid pvs <dig>  harboring qsea, into reporter strain tevs <dig> and expression of chromosomal fusion lee1:lacz  was measured. overexpression of qsea from a multicopy plasmid negated the inhibitory activity of isolimonic acid . furthermore, the possibility of transcriptional regulation of qsea by isolimonic acid was determined by assessing the qsea expression. a <  <dig> fold change in the transcript levels of qsea indicated that isolimonic acid do not regulate the expression of qsea . altogether, the isolimonic acid appears to repress ler expression and possibly lee by modulating qsea activity.

discussion
ehec is an important gastrointestinal pathogen, prolific biofilm former and demonstrates resistance to various antimicrobials in biofilm mode of growth  <cit> . for successful colonization of gastrointestinal tract and initiation of infection, adhesion of ehec to intestinal epithelium is an essential early event  <cit> . additionally, several e. coli pathovars were reported to produce and live in biofilms inside the human body  <cit> . in order to counteract these maladies, an antivirulence molecule with anti-adhesion and/or anti-biofilm properties may be highly desirable. research in our laboratory has identified several molecules with differing anti-virulence effects  <cit> . the current work examined the potential of five citrus limonoids- isolimonic acid, ichangin, isoobacunoic acid, ioag and dnag, to inhibit ehec biofilm and ttss. all the tested limonoids seem to interfere with the ehec biofilm formation in a dose dependent fashion . isolimonic acid was the most potent inhibitor of the ehec biofilm and adhesion to caco- <dig> cells. moreover, the limonoids do not seem to affect growth of ehec, suggesting that limonoids, especially isolimonic acid inhibits ehec biofilm and adhesion without adversely affecting the growth or metabolic activity .

in ehec, the initial attachment to various surfaces such as epithelial cells and plastic surface is regulated by several factors including ttss, flagella and fimbriae  <cit> . lee encoded ttss, effector proteins as well as flagella and intimin  <cit>  play an important role in adhesion of ehec to gastrointestinal tract surface, while flagella and fimbriae also contribute in biofilm formation. results of the adhesion and biofilm assay indicated that one or more of above-mentioned factors may be affected by limonoids particularly by isolimonic acid. to investigate this hypothesis, expression of lee encoded genes and flagellar master regulators flhdc was determined by qrt-pcr. isolimonic acid and ichangin appear to exert their antivirulence and biofilm inhibitory effect by repressing ttss carried on lee, stx <dig>  which encodes for shiga toxin and flagellar master regulon flhdc .

in ehec, expression of lee and flagellar operons are regulated by multiple environmental and genetic factors including qs  <cit> . in particular ai-2/ai-3/epinephrine mediated cell-cell signaling regulates the expression of both flagellar operon and lee, which contribute to adhesion and biofilm formation. furthermore, expression of stx <dig> is also regulated by qs  <cit> . therefore, repression of ttss, flagella and stx <dig> indicated a possibility that limonoids, especially isolimonic acid may interfere with ehec qs. isolimonic acid was chosen for further studies, as it demonstrated the most potent inhibition of biofilm formation, adhesion, lee, flhdc and stx <dig>  for determination of ai-3/epinephrine mediated qs in ehec, reporter strains tevs  <dig> and tevs <dig> containing chromosomal fusions lee1:lacz and lee2:lacz were used. the analysis was confined to lee <dig> and lee <dig>  because these two operons have been reported to be directly activated by ai-3/epinephrine mediated qs  <cit> . to test if the isolimonic acid acts as an qs inhibitor, pm/epinephrine stimulated activation of lee <dig> and lee <dig> in reporter strains was measured  <cit> . the pm, described earlier  <cit> , was used as a source of ai- <dig> molecules as the purified ai- <dig> was not available. repression of ai-3/epinephrine-induced ler, lee <dig> and lee <dig>  indicated that isolimonic acid interferes with ehec qs system.

the autoinducers and hormones reportedly increase the autophosphorylation levels of histidine kinase qsec, which then activates qseb to regulate motility and biofilm formation  <cit> . furthermore, interaction of ai-3/epinephrine with qsea activates lee encoded genes  <cit> . it was possible that isolimonic acid interferes with ehec qs in a mechanism involving qsebc and qsea. if activity of isolimonic acid depends upon functional qsebc, deletion of qsebc will eliminate the inhibitory effect. on the other hand, complementation of Δqsebc with plasmid borne qsebc is likely to restore the inhibitory effect of isolimonic acid. furthermore, overexpression of qsebc in wild type background  will result in higher levels of qsebc proteins in the cell and consequently will have a higher activity. this higher level of activity may compensate and relieve the inhibitory effect of isolimonic acid on biofilm formation. in order to verify qsebc dependent inhibition, biofilm formation in Δqsebc strain  and complemented strain   <cit>  in presence of  <dig> μg/ml of isolimonic acid was measured. as expected, isolimonic acid did not reduce the biofilm formation in vs <dig>  in contrast, isolimonic acid exposure resulted in a significant decrease in vs <dig>  biofilm as measured by crystal violet , indicating involvement of qsebc. additionally, overexpression of qsebc, qseb and qsec in ehec atcc  <dig>  under the control of arabinose operon restored the inhibitory effect of isolimonic acid on ehec biofilm formation . taken together these results suggest that effect of isolimonic acid is dependent upon qsebc. furthermore, the effects of isolimonic acid did not seem to arise from modulation of qsebc expression. however, based on the current data it was not possible to differentiate, if the effect is dependent solely upon qseb or qsec, as supplementation of ehec by both qseb and qsec relieved the inhibitory effect. further studies are required to precisely determine if the target of isolimonic acid is qseb or qsec.

to understand the role of qsea in isolimonic acid mediated repression of lee, expression levels of transcriptional regulator ler were measured as qsea is reported to directly activate expression of ler <cit> . ler is the transcriptional regulator of the genes encoded in lee and activates the genes encoded in lee  <cit> . we hypothesized that if isolimonic acid affect ler via qsea, the ler expression will not change in Δqsea strain  but complementation of qsea  from plasmid will restore the inhibitory effect. in addition, overexpression of qsea in wild type strain atcc  <dig> will negate the inhibitory effect of isolimonic acid. the hypothesis was tested by measuring the expression of ler using qrt-pcr in vs <dig> and vs <dig>  grown in presence of  <dig> μg/ml isolimonic acid and compared with dmso. the results demonstrated that expression of ler was not significantly altered in Δqsea strain , whereas a  <dig>  fold repression of ler  was observed in qsea complemented strain . furthermore, overexpression of qsea from multicopy plasmid pvs <dig> in tevs <dig> background  nullified the repressive effect  of isolimonic acid on lee <dig> observed in figure 5a. collectively the data indicated that repression of lee by isolimonic acid is dependent on qsea. however, isolimonic acid does not seem to transcriptionally modulate the expression of qsea. thus the results of the study indicate towards a model where isolimonic acid modulates the biofilm and ttss in qsebc and qsea dependent fashion, however without regulating the expression of these genes .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that the citrus limonoids, particularly isolimonic acid and ichangin are strong inhibitors of biofilm formation and attachment of ehec to caco- <dig> cells. furthermore, isolimonic acid and ichangin seems to affect biofilm formation and ttss by repressing lee and flagellar operon. isolimonic acid seems to exert its effect by inhibiting ai-3/epinephrine mediated cell-cell signaling in qsebc and qsea dependent manner. however, the mechanism by which isolimonic acid affects the qsebc and qsea remains to be elucidated. one possibility is that the isolimonic acid may interfere with the dna binding activities of qseb and qsea. another possible scenario will be that isolimonic acid interferes with phosphorylation events. however, further study is required to determine the target of isolimonic acid for the modulation of flhdc and ler. in addition, determination of the structure-activity relationship will provide further insights into the inhibitory action of isolimonic acid. in nutshell, isolimonic acid acts as an antivirulence agent in ehec and may serve as lead compound for development of novel agents. furthermore, the fact that isolimonic acid is present in citrus juices and do not demonstrate cytotoxic effect on normal human cell line  <cit> , increases the desirability to develop it as antivirulence agent.
