BACKGROUND
a variety of transcription factors function as dimeric proteins that recognize dyadic and palindromic dna sequences in promoter regions and facilitate gene expression by recruiting the transcription initiation complex including rna polymerase ii. sequence-specific dna binding of dimeric transcription factors requires the presence of two half-sites localized in a specific orientation and spacing so that each protomer can interact with the dna-binding motif  <cit> . the binding topography for each protomer in a dimeric transcription factor bound to dna is the same in the sense that there are two identical and non-overlapping protein-dna contacts forming between each protomer and the dna double helix. while dimerization of signal-dependent transcription factors is often a prerequisite for optimal dna binding to natural response elements, some transcriptional regulatory proteins also recognize dna binding sites as monomers.

homodimeric transcription factors recognizing such small dna-sequence motifs are typically grouped into families on the basis of structural homology in their dimerization and dna-binding properties. the family of stat  proteins serves the dual function of signal transduction and transcriptional activation in cytokine signalling. in humans, seven stat genes have been identified, and their encoded proteins are engaged in such diverse cellular processes as growth control, proliferation, differentiation, and immune response  <cit> . the founding member of this family, stat <dig>  is well characterized for its role in transmitting interferon signals from membrane-bound cytokine receptors to the nucleus where it drives transcription. interferon-γ -induced nuclear accumulation of stat <dig> homodimers is a hallmark of this signal pathway which requires binding of the cytokine to its cognate receptor and the auto-phosphorylation of non-covalently receptor-associated janus kinases   <cit> . the activated jak kinases then phosphorylate the intracellular receptor tail, thereby creating phospho-tyrosine docking sites for the recruitment of stat <dig> via its src-homology-2- domain. subsequently, jaks phosphorylate a signature tyrosine residue  in the carboxyterminus of stat <dig> which results in the formation of parallel stat <dig> homodimers stabilized through reciprocal sh2-phosphotyrosine interactions  <cit> . the tyrosine-phosphorylated dimers are then transported via a ran-dependent, importin-α/β-mediated transport pathway to the nucleus. there they bind to palindromic gas  elements in the promoter regions of ifnγ-responsive genes  <cit> . the consensus gas motif 5′-ttc3-4gaa-′ <dig> has been found in sequences recognized by most members of the stat family  <cit> . after dissociation from dna, stat <dig> dimers are dephosphorylated by the nuclear tyrosine phosphatase tc <dig> which is a prerequisite for their nuclear export  <cit> . the cytoplasmic stat <dig> proteins may then be rephosphorylated depending on receptor occupancy and participate in another cycle of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. in addition to this carrier-mediated nuclear import of phospho-stat <dig> in ifnγ-stimulated cells, a highly dynamic translocation between the cytosolic and nuclear compartment was uncovered also for unphosphorylated stat <dig> in resting cells which is mediated through direct contacts of residues in the stat <dig> linker domain with nucleoporins located in the nuclear pore complex  <cit> .

previous studies have proposed that dephosphorylation of tyrosine residue  <dig> requires extensive spatial reorientation of the protomers from a parallel to an antiparallel dimer conformation   <cit> . using an extensive mutagenesis approach, darnell and co-workers have suggested that after phosphotyrosine-sh <dig> disjunction the phospho-stat <dig> dimer is still held together by reciprocal aminoterminal interactions  <cit>  . this spatial reorganization from a parallel to an antiparallel dimer conformation might expose the phosphotyrosine residue  <dig> as a target of the tc <dig> phosphatase. however, it remains controversial whether the interconversion of conformers requires that the interacting partner protomers are individually connected to each other. this would most probably occur through the n-domains, while the two core fragments would undergo extensive spatial reorientation . a stretch of amino-acid residues within the coiled-coil domain functions as a linker and ensures that the position of the n-domain in relation to the core fragment is flexible  <cit> . an alternative model proposes that the stat <dig> dimers first dissociate into isolated monomers and then reassembled into new dimeric complexes . in contrast to the first model, this dissociation and re-association cycle allows the formation of recombined dimers. using analytical ultracentrifugation of purified recombinant stat <dig> proteins, the vinkemeier laboratory revealed that stat <dig> constantly oscillated between the two dimer conformations and that both are equally stable with a dissociation constant  of approximately  <dig> nm  <cit> . in addition, the authors demonstrated that the stat <dig> aminoterminal domain is engaged in the formation of high-affinity tetrameric complexes. however, from these ultracentrifugation experiments, neither the molecular mechanisms nor the time course of interdimeric protomer exchange can be resolved. thus, we performed kinetic measurements by means of gel-shift assays to analyse the stability of dimeric stat <dig> complexes in vitro.figure  <dig> 
graphic illustration of putative pathways for the interconversion of parallel and antiparallel stat <dig> conformers. the domain structure of stat <dig> is marked with different colours: the n-terminal domain  is added via a short flexible segment to the core fragment comprising the coiled-coil domain , the dna-binding domain , the linker domain , the sh <dig> domain , and the carboxyterminal transactivation domain . the interface in the antiparallel dimer is formed by reciprocal binding between the coiled-coil domain of one protomer and the dna-binding domain of the partner protomer, while in the parallel dimer there are reciprocal interactions between the phospho-tyrosine residue  <dig>  and the sh <dig> domain. model  <dig>  assumes that the core domains of the two partner protomers rotate around each other facilitated by reciprocal n-terminal interactions  <cit> . in contrast, the dissociation/re-association model  allows the formation of new dimer combinations and does not require the presence of the n-terminal domain  <cit> . addition of specific dna-binding elements termed gamma-activated sites  results in the formation of stat <dig> dimers bound to a single gas site  or stat <dig> tetramers when complexed with two gas sites arranged in a tandem orientation .



methods
cell culture
stat1-negative u3a cells  <cit>  were cultured in a humidified 5% co <dig> atmosphere at 37°c in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum , 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin . cells were transfected with the transfection reagent megatran <dig>   according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated for 45 min with 50 ng/ml recombinant human ifnγ .

plasmids
for expression of stat <dig> tagged with green-fluorescent protein  in human cells, we used the plasmid pstat1-gfp  <cit> . based on the vector pegfp-n <dig>  it coded for a recombinant full-length human stat <dig> protein  fused to gfp in carboxyterminal orientation. for expression of untagged stat <dig>  u3a cells were transfected with the vector pcdna <dig>   coding for full-length human stat <dig>  which is termed here pstat <dig>  <cit> . the pstat1-gfp and pstat <dig> vectors coded either for wild-type  stat <dig> or an aminoterminal point mutant thereof with a substitution of alanine for phenylalanine in position  <dig>  <cit> . the f77a mutation in the two plasmids was confirmed by dna sequencing.

protein extraction
cells expressing either gfp-tagged or untagged stat <dig> were cultured on 6-well dishes and on the day after transfection treated for 45 min with 50 ng/ml recombinant human ifnγ. cells were then lysed for 5 min on ice in 50 μl cytoplasmic extraction buffer containing 20 mm hepes, ph  <dig> , 10 mm kcl, 10%  glycerol, 1 mm edta,  <dig>  mm na3vo <dig>   <dig> % igepal-ca- <dig>  3 mm dtt,  <dig>  mm pefabloc, and complete mini protease inhibitors . the lysates were centrifuged at 16000×g , and supernatants spun again at 4°c for 5 min at 16000×g. the supernatants resulting from this centrifugation step were used as cytoplasmic extracts, while the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl nuclear extraction buffer  glycerol, 1 mm edta,  <dig>  mm na3vo <dig>  3 mm dtt,  <dig>  mm pefabloc, and complete mini protease inhibitors) and left on ice for 30 min. the samples were centrifuged at 16000×g for 15 min  and the supernatants collected as nuclear extracts. equal amounts of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from the same samples were mixed and the whole cell extracts stored at −80°c until further use.

western blotting
for immunoblotting, the combined cytosolic and nuclear lysates were boiled in 6× laemmli buffer, resolved by 10% sds-page and blotted onto pvdf membranes. the membranes were incubated first with a rabbit monoclonal antibody directed against tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig>  and then with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to irdye 800cw . after detection of bound immunoreactivity on a li-cor odyssey imaging machine, the blots were stripped for 60 min at 60°c in a buffer containing 2% sds,  <dig> % β-mercaptoethanol, and  <dig>  mm tris–hcl, ph  <dig> , and subsequently reprobed with polyclonal antibody c- <dig> directed against stat <dig>  and secondary antibody.

electrophoretic mobility shift assay
cellular extracts from ifnγ-stimulated cells expressing either stat1-gfp or untagged stat <dig> were probed for binding activity to dna containing one or two high-affinity consensus gas sites  <cit> . for use in gel-shift experiments, dna probes were generated by hybridizing inverse, complementary oligonucleotides containing poly- <dig> overhangs on the 5′ end of each primer. in a subsequent end-filling reaction catalysed by the klenow fragment , the hybridized oligonucleotides were incubated with desoxy-atp -labelled on its alpha-phosphate group . the sequences of the two duplex oligonucleotides used in this study were as follows : m67; 5′-cgacatttcccgtaaatctg-′ <dig>  and 2xgas; 5′-cgtttccccgaaattgacggatttccccgaaac-′ <dig>  in all electrophoretic mobility shift assays ,  <dig> microliters of cellullar extracts reacted with 1 ng of the -labelled duplex oligonucleotide probe.

to assess the dissociation of endogenous stat <dig> from a single gas element, a 750-fold molar excess of unlabelled m <dig> dna was incubated with the shift reactions for the indicated times on ice. similar competition experiments were performed for the identification of stat1-containing complexes. in addition, supershift reactions were performed at rt by incubating the shift reactions for 30 min with 20 ng of either stat1-specific c- <dig> antibody or the unspecific h- <dig> antibody directed against stat <dig> . for co-incubation experiments, we mixed whole cell extracts from u3a cells exclusively expressing either gfp-tagged or untagged stat <dig> and immediately incubated the mixed samples with the radioactively labelled gas probe for 45 min. in a second approach, we combined the extracts in the absence of the gas probe, which was added after 45 min immediately before gel electrophoresis. in control experiments, we separately incubated similar amounts of the extracts each with the -labelled probe and combined the reactions not before the 45 min co-incubation period was accomplished. thus, in the first two experiments but not in the control experiments, gfp-tagged and untagged stat <dig> dimers had the chance to recombine and exchange their protomeric components.

statistical analyses
binding intensities on autoradiographs were quantified using the imagej software from at least triplicate gel-shift experiments. means and standard deviations were calculated for each stat1-containing complex bound to dna. differences in dna-binding activity were analyzed by anova with tukey’s post-hoc tests. all data were analysed using the sigmastat  program. in all analyses, a p value ≤ <dig>  was used to indicate statistical significance.

RESULTS
fusion with gfp did not affect the dna-binding kinetics of stat1
in preliminary experiments, we assessed the dna-binding activity of gfp-tagged and gfp-untagged recombinant stat <dig> to a 43-mer dna probe containing two high-affinity gas sites with a spacing of 10 bp. as shown in figure 2a, the two stat <dig> proteins bound the probe, termed here 2xgas, as dimeric and tetrameric complexes, indicating that either one or both of the tandem gas sites were occupied. the high concentration of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> in the emsa reactions favours the formation of 2xgas-bound tetramers over single dimers occupying only one gas site and leaving the other unoccupied. the presence of a stat1-specific antibody, but not an antibody directed against stat <dig>  significantly retarded the gel electrophoretic mobility of stat1-containing complexes. as expected for intact cooperative, 2-site binding, competition with a 750-fold molar excess of unlabelled gas oligonucleotides readily displaced stat <dig> dimers occupying only one of the two tandem gas sites, whereas binding of tetrameric complexes to two adjacent gas binding sites was virtually unaffected .figure  <dig> 
 electrophoretic mobility shift assay  for the identification of green-fluorescent protein-tagged stat <dig>  and untagged stat <dig>  extracts from reconstituted stat1-negative u3a cells expressing recombinant gfp-tagged or untagged stat <dig> were incubated at room temperature with a -labelled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two gas sites in tandem orientation . supershift reactions were performed by adding anti-stat <dig> antibody c- <dig> , and, as control, an unspecific stat <dig> antibody . for competition, a 750-fold molar excess of unlabelled gas was added to the reaction . asterisks mark unspecific bands.  similar dissociation kinetics of stat1-gfp and stat <dig> from a single consensus gas site . cellular extracts from u3a cells expressing tagged or untagged stat <dig> were incubated for 15 min with -labelled m <dig> before on ice a 750-fold molar excess of unlabelled m <dig> was added for  <dig>   <dig>  and 10 min, respectively.  specific dna-binding activity was detected by autoradiography in vacuum-dried gels.  the histograms demonstrate the decline in specific dna-binding activity during challenge with unlabelled m <dig> for stat1-gfp  and untagged stat <dig> . bars and asterisks indicate significant differences between samples over time.



since we had previously shown that gfp tagging significantly reduces subcellular trafficking  <cit> , we next wondered whether the time course of stat <dig> release from a single consensus gas site also differs between the gfp fusion and the untagged protein. for this purpose, we pre-incubated extracts from reconstituted, ifnγ-pre-treated u3a cells expressing either stat1-gfp or untagged stat <dig> with a -labelled m <dig> probe containing a single gas site for 15 min on ice and subsequently added a 750-fold molar excess of unlabelled gas elements for  <dig>   <dig> and 10 min, before the ice-cold reactions were loaded onto the gel . results from autoradiography showed that after 5 min of exposure on ice approximately two-thirds of the initial gas-bound stat <dig> dimers resisted the challenge with the high molar concentration of unlabelled dna, and after an additional 5 min, dna binding activity was further reduced . however, we found that the dissociation kinetics from a single gas sequence did not differ between the two stat <dig> variants. collectively, these data demonstrate that gas binding is not affected by carboxyterminal fusion to gfp as the addition of the tag resulted in similar binding intensities and, furthermore, confirm the fast release of stat <dig> dimers from a single gas element.

binding and release of stat <dig> from tandem gas sites
given that the dna-binding properties are unaffected by the fusion with gfp, we next wondered whether the dissociation rate of stat <dig> dimers into monomers exceeds that of dimer release from high-affinity gas elements. to this end, we mixed equal amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated gfp-tagged and untagged stat <dig> together with -labelled 2xgas and after 45 min of incubation loaded the reaction onto the gel. in parallel experiments, we added -2xgas separately to each of the samples and only combined the two non-co-incubated reactions immediately before loading together into the same lane . as expected, in the non-co-incubated emsa reactions stat1-gfp and untagged stat <dig> migrated exclusively as two distinct bands corresponding to dimeric and tetrameric complexes, respectively. however, in the co-incubated reactions we noted the appearance of a new band which was absent in the non-co-incubated samples and migrated with a velocity that was intermediate between the two variants. this band corresponds to stat <dig> tetramers consisting of a 1: <dig> stoichiometry of tagged and untagged stat <dig> molecules, most likely resulting from the occupation of one stat1-gfp homodimer and one adjacent untagged homodimer per duplex oligonucleotide.figure  <dig> 
 demonstration of stat <dig> heterotetrameric complexes occupying a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two consensus gas sites. cellular extracts from u3a cells expressing exclusively either gfp-tagged or untagged stat <dig> were incubated separately with -labelled 2xgas for 45 min  or, alternatively, mixed and co-incubated for 45 min . supershift reactions were performed by adding either an anti-stat <dig>  or an unspecific anti-stat <dig> antibody . asterisks mark unspecific bands.  stat1-gfp and stat <dig> dimers compete for binding to 2xgas. different amounts of extracts from u3a cells expressing exclusively gfp-tagged or untagged stat <dig> reacted either separately with -2xgas or were mixed and reacted with the probe immediately before being loaded onto the gel.  absence of binding to gas elements promotes interdimeric protomer exchange. stat1-gfp- and stat1-containing extracts were co-incubated for 45 min in the presence  or absence of -2xgas . immediately before the reaction in lane  <dig> was loaded onto the gel, a similar amount of -2xgas was added to the reaction as in lane  <dig>   accumulation of interchanged stat <dig> complexes at tandem gas sites. mixed stat1-gfp- and stat1-containing cellular extracts were incubated with -2xgas for the indicated times, before being separated by gel electrophoresis . as controls, non-mixed extracts were used in lanes  <dig> and  <dig>   time-dependent accumulation of tetrameric stat <dig> at the expense of dimeric complexes. histograms depict the ratio of tetrameric-to-total stat <dig> binding activity presented as means and standard deviations from three independent experiments as shown in . bars and asterisks indicate significant differences in the pattern of tetrameric-to-total gas occupancy.



to corroborate this observation, we varied the concentrations of tagged versus untagged stat <dig> proteins and tested the co-incubated reactions for binding to -2xgas . the band intensity of the stat <dig> variant with the lower concentration showed a steeper decline as compared to those with a higher concentration, indicating that it was dissipated as it contributed to the formation of a heterotetramer band. notably, in the continuous presence of -2xgas we did not observe the appearance of stat1-gfp/stat <dig> complexes composed of a 1: <dig> or 3: <dig> stoichiometry. thus, as compared to the fast release of stable dimers from single gas sites on ice, the dissociation of homodimers and formation of heterodimers at rt was not detectable under this reaction condition.

gas binding protects stat <dig> dimers from protomer exchange
while the above-mentioned gel-shift reactions were performed in the continuous presence of radioactively labelled dna, we also conducted experiments in which we first combined the gfp-tagged and gfp-untagged stat <dig> variants for 30 min in the absence of gas elements and added the dna probe shortly before loading onto the gel. in controls, we incubated the extracts containing tagged and untagged stat <dig> separately with -2xgas for 30 min and then loaded the two reactions onto the same lane of the gel. this protocol was chosen to assess whether binding to high-affinity gas sequences reduces the rate of protomer exchange. as seen in figure 3c and d, in reactions allowing gfp-tagged and untagged homodimers to recombine in the absence of gas sequences, there was a readily detectable pattern of newly formed bands corresponding to heterotetrameric complexes in 3: <dig>  1: <dig>  and 1: <dig> stoichiometry, respectively. the assembly of asymmetric heterotetrameric complexes bound to 2xgas was facilitated, when no gas element was present in the reactions . similarly, in the continuous presence of the gas probe, we observed a time-dependent increase in the ratio of tetrameric-to-dimeric stat <dig> complexes occupying double-stranded 2xgas oligonucleotides. however, the presence of high-affinity dna-binding sites during the entire incubation period significantly decreased the rate of heterotetramer formation . collectively, our data revealed the time-dependent de novo formation of stat1-gfp/stat <dig> heterodimers in various molar compositions which accumulated at tandem gas binding sites as a consequence of an interdimeric exchange of protomers.

homotypic interactions between stat <dig> n-domains are dispensable for the exchange of monomers
mertens and colleagues proposed a model of conformational shift between parallel and antiparallel stat <dig> dimer conformations in which reciprocal aminoterminal contacts are required to assist in freeing the phosphotyrosin-sh <dig> binding  <cit> . to test this hypothesis, we expressed the oligomerization-deficient point mutant f77a in stat1-negative u3a cells and monitored the de novo formation of gas-bound dimers in extracts of ifnγ-treated cells with time as compared to the wild-type protein. the phenylalanine residue in position  <dig> has been identified to mediate oligomerization of stat <dig> dimers via aminoterminal-aminoterminal interactions between two adjacent monomers  <cit> . given that upon stimulation of cells with an equal amount of ifnγ the pool of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> molecules is significantly higher in the f77a mutant as compared to its wild-type counterpart  <cit> , we first performed immunoblotting experiments to normalize phospho-protein concentrations allowing kinetic measurements in gel-shift assays . cellular extracts from ifnγ-stimulated cells containing similar amounts of phosphorylated stat1-gfp and untagged stat <dig> were then mixed and co-incubated for  <dig>   <dig> or 30 min at room temperature with -labelled m <dig> before being loaded onto a non-denaturing sds gel. autoradiograms demonstrated the appearance of a new band in reactions co-incubated for 15 min, which was absent when the extracts were incubated separately . as compared to gfp-tagged and untagged homodimers, this newly formed band moved with an intermediate velocity and its intensity increased over 30 min of co-incubation . since the m <dig> probe can be occupied for spacing reasons only by a single stat <dig> dimer, this band corresponds to newly formed stat1-gfp/stat <dig> heterodimers. our results showed that the phenylalanine-to-alanine mutant displayed similar time kinetics for the de novo formation of stat <dig> heterodimers as compared to the wild-type protein . this finding demonstrated that aminoterminal-aminoterminal interactions are dispensable for the interdimeric exchange of protomers.figure  <dig> 
reciprocal aminoterminal interactions are not required for interdimeric protomer exchange.  expression of tyrosine-phosphorylated gfp-tagged and untagged stat <dig> and their corresponding f77a mutants in cellular extracts used for emsa. a representative western blot experiment using a stat1-specific phospho-tyrosine antibody  and the corresponding re-blot after the stripping off of bound immunoreactivity and re-incubation with pan-stat <dig> antibody c- <dig>  is shown.  mutation of phenylalanine  <dig> to alanine does not interfere with the formation of heterodimeric stat <dig> complexes. extracts from u3a cells expressing wild-type or mutant stat <dig> with and without the gfp-tag were co-incubated and the occupancy of the m <dig> element by heterodimers monitored over time using emsa. a typical autoradiogram  and a quantification of three similar experiments  are shown. the histograms present means and standard deviations as well as significant differences over time.  aminoterminal contacts between monomers are dispensable for the dissociation and re-association of stat <dig> dimers. extracts from u3a cells expressing either stat1-gfp or untagged stat <dig> were separately incubated in the presence of -2xgas before being loaded together onto the gel  or incubated as a mixture in the presence  or absence of -2xgas, which in the latter case was added immediately before gel electrophoresis . reaction time was 45 min for all samples. an asterisk at the gel margin marks an unspecific band.  quantification of band intensities corresponding to tetrameric stat <dig> bound to tandem gas sites across the indicated stoichiometry of gfp-tagged versus untagged stat <dig> molecules. numbers under each column give the ratio of stat1-gfp/stat <dig> molecules for each band. the protocol used for these experiments was similar to that shown in .



next, we co-incubated extracts from cells expressing exclusively stat1-f77a-gfp or stat1-f77a in the presence of a dna probe containing two high-affinity gas elements for 30 min. both mutant and wild-type stat <dig> were able to be assembled into new heterotetramers . notably, the concentrations of stat1-gfp/stat <dig> heterotetramers with a 3: <dig> and 1: <dig> stoichiometry were reduced in the presence of high-affinity gas sites as compared to samples in which dimers were free to exchange their protomers due to the absence of dna in the reactions . as judged from a slightly retarded electrophoretic mobility, the topology of tetrameric, but not dimeric complexes of mutant stat <dig> bound to 2xgas seemed to be somewhat less compact when compared to the wild-type protein, which in the case of the mutant most likely resulted from its lack of cooperative dna binding  <cit> . in summary, we again found that gas binding impaired the interdimeric exchange rate of protomers. furthermore, we observed that substitution of alanine for the critical phenylalanine residue in position  <dig> did not affect the recombination of monomers between stat <dig> dimers. we therefore concluded that homotypic interactions between stat <dig> aminoterminal domains are not required for the process of protomer exchange.

discussion
in this paper, we describe a kinetic model of stat <dig> protomer exchange which is based on the spontaneous dissociation of tyrosine-phosphorylated dimers into isolated monomers and their subsequent self-association . as compared to the fast release of stat <dig> dimers from single gas sites, the in vitro half-life of phosphorylated stat <dig> dimers is relatively long and exceeds 10 min at room temperature. in addition, we found that binding to high-affinity gas sites negatively affects the velocity of protomer exchange and thus critically decelerates the rate of the dissociation/re-association process. however, even in the absence of specific dna-binding sites the dimeric structure of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> remains considerably stable. furthermore, we observed that the oligomerization-deficient point mutant stat1-f77a displays similar kinetics of dimer dissociation as compared to the wild-type protein. thus, in contrast to tetramer stabilization  <cit> , we found no evidence for a role of a putative f77-mediated tether in facilitating the mutual transition between the two dimer conformations. this result demonstrates that reciprocal aminoterminal interactions between two adjacent monomers are dispensable for the formation of new dimer combinations.

our findings provide support for the model proposed by vinkemeier et al. that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the partitioning of stat <dig> between the parallel and anti-parallel dimer configuration  <cit> . the authors estimated that the half-life of the two stat <dig> dimer conformations ranges between  <dig> and 40 min, which we confirm here for the phosphorylated dimer using a different technique  <cit> . from our study we cannot exclude the possibility that a constant oscillation between the two dimer configurations occurs at a much higher rate and that the critical f <dig> residue is engaged in this dynamic process. however, in this case, the proposed fast mutual interchange between the two dimer conformations cannot be the rate-limiting step for the dissociation and re-association of dimers and dimer stability should only marginally be affected by conformational flexibility.

the physiological significance of the observed interdimeric protomer exchange in terms of interferon-mediated signal transduction remains controversial. it is well-established that the antiparallel stat <dig> dimer is the accessible substrate for the nuclear tyrosine phosphatase, while conversely dna-binding protects parallel phospho-dimers from being tyrosine dephosphorylated  <cit> . the parallel-to-antiparallel reorientation of the phosphorylated stat <dig> core allows for efficient dephosphorylation, as surface-exposed mutations in the interface destabilizing the antiparallel dimer conformation are associated with prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation levels  <cit> . similarly, hyperphosphorylation was also observed for the homologous somatic l78r mutation in stat <dig> found in inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma  <cit> . however, domoszlai and co-workers reported that this mutation in the stat <dig> molecule disturbs latent dimer formation and results in a monomeric population of unphosphorylated stat <dig>  <cit> .

our kinetic measurements support the conclusion that the dissociation of stat <dig> dimers into monomers may be the rate-limiting step in ifnγ-mediated signal transduction rather than the recognition of high-affinity gas sites within the genome. interestingly, a previous study using single-molecule microscopy has revealed numerous binding events of tyrosine-phosphorylated stat <dig> in the nucleus indicative of distinct saltatory movements with residence times of up to 5 sec and intermittent diffusive motion  <cit> . this phenomenon was explained by the retardation and immobilization of activated stat <dig> dimers when they randomly encounter their putative chromatin target sites. in line with the results from this single-molecule mobility analysis in living cells, our in vitro data confirm that the ephemeral binding to a single gas site is substantially less stable than the long time scale dynamics of dimeric stat <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our in vitro observations support the hypothesis that there is a constitutive dissociation of phospho-dimers into isolated monomers and their subsequent re-association into newly formed tyrosine-phosphorylated dimers. the emsa experiments demonstrated that the interdimeric protomer exchange occurs at low rates when compared to the fast release from high-affinity gas elements. additionally, we found that binding to gas sites has a negative impact on the protomer exchange rate by substantially impeding the recombination process of dimeric stat <dig> in solution. however, reciprocal aminoterminal interactions between two adjacent partner monomers are not required for the dissociation and re-association of dimers, as determined by an unaltered interdimeric exchange rate of the oligomerization-deficient point mutant f77a as compared to its wild-type counterpart. further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular basis by which the isolated stat <dig> monomers recombine into newly formed dimers, which is of particular interest with respect to the regulation of gene activation in ifnγ-mediated signalling.
