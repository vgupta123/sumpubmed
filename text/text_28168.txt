BACKGROUND
normal somatic cells undergo a finite number of divisions before entering a state of irreversible growth arrest termed cellular senescence  <cit> . this is triggered in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli including progressive telomere shortening or changes in telomeric structure at the ends of chromosomes or other forms of genotoxic stress such as oncogene activation, or dna damage or oxidative stress, resulting in a dna damage response and growth arrest via activation of the p <dig> tumour suppressor pathway  <cit> . non-genotoxic stress induces senescence by a telomere independent mechanism involving activation of the p16-prb pathway by up-regulation of p16ink4a  <cit> .

cellular senescence acts as an important tumour suppressor mechanism. overcoming senescence and acquiring a limitless replicative potential has been proposed to be one of the key events required for malignant transformation  <cit> . senescence is thought to have evolved as an example of antagonistic pleiotrophy, whereby its beneficial traits in a reproductively active individual have deleterious effects later in life  <cit> . the underlying mechanisms that control cellular senescence, the signal transduction pathways involved and how the diverse signals that result in senescence are all integrated, remain poorly defined. moreover the downstream effectors of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways that result in the irreversible growth arrest and entry into senescence are unknown.

the discovery of rna interference as a mechanism to silence gene expression has revolutionized studies on mammalian gene expression and has permitted loss-of-function genome-wide genetic screens, to identify genes involved in a variety of cellular processes, to be performed  <cit> . a number of shrna libraries have been developed for carrying out such genome-wide screens, one of which is the psm <dig> retroviral shrnamir library  <cit>  . this library has several unique features that make it very versatile and efficient for large-scale screens particularly the human microrna- <dig>  adapted design which increases knockdown specificity and efficiency  <cit> .

here we present a rna interference screen using the human psm <dig> retroviral shrnamir library, carried out in the conditionally immortal hmf3a human fibroblasts, to identify genes whose silencing bypasses senescence arrest induced by activation of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways. the primary screen identified  <dig> known genes and another  <dig> shrnamirs targetting as yet unidentified loci. comparison of the known targets with genes known to be up-regulated upon senescence by micro-array expression profiling, identified  <dig> common genes whose expression was reversed when senescence was bypassed upon inactivation of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways.

RESULTS
to directly identify the downstream effectors of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways, we have utilized the conditionally immortal hmf3a human fibroblasts that were derived by immortalising adult human mammary fibroblasts with the catalytic subunit of human telomerase and a thermolabile u19tsa <dig> mutant of sv <dig> large t antigen  <cit> . these cells are immortal if grown at 34°c but undergo a senescence arrest upon inactivation of the thermolabile u19tsa <dig> t antigen resulting in the activation of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways  <cit> . they are stringently temperature sensitive but senescence can be readily bypassed by inactivation of the p53-p <dig> or the p16-prb pathway  <cit> . to facilitate efficient transduction of these cells by retroviral infection, they were transduced with the full length murine ecotropic retroviral receptor and cl3ecor cells derived, that most closely mirror the parental cells  <cit> . the temperature dependent senescent arrest of cl3ecor cells and its bypass upon inactivation of p21cip <dig> by silencing or sequestration of the rb family of proteins by hpv <dig> e <dig> are shown in figure  <dig> 

the psm <dig> library version  <dig>  comprising  <dig>  constructs targetting  <dig>  human cancer associated genes was amplified and each  <dig> well plate used to prepare a pool of plasmid dna; each of the  <dig> pools contained between  <dig> to  <dig> different shrnamir constructs with each gene being represented by  <dig> to  <dig> shrnamirs. to ensure that cl3ecor cells were sufficiently sensitive to identify a single shrnamir construct in a pool of  <dig> shrnamir constructs, prsp21f   <cit>  was mixed in a ratio of 1: <dig> with prslamina/c and used to assay bypass of senescence in cl3ecor cells. the prsp21f construct was used because the psm <dig> library version  <dig>  did not contain any silencing constructs for p21cip <dig>  silencing of lamina/c did not bypass senescence, very few growing colonies were obtained  whereas silencing of p21cip <dig> was very efficient and produced essentially a confluent monolayer of growing cells . the 1: <dig> p21cip1/lamina/c mix produced numerous distinct densely growing colonies  indicating that cl3ecor cells and the procedure were sufficiently sensitive to generate colonies in which senescence had been overcome.

shrna interference screen
the formula: ln /ln  recommended for genetic screens by the nolan lab , suggested that approximately  <dig> independent infectious events would be sufficient for a 99% confidence that all shrnas within a pool had been sampled. to ensure that the screen would be saturating, virus sufficient to yield  <dig>  infectious events was utilised for each pool . the screen was performed in successive waves of  <dig> pools. to minimise variation and background reversion, cl3ecor cells were used at the same passage for every pool. virus prepared from prsp21f and prslamin a/c was used as positive and negative controls respectively to evaluate the level of background and ensure that the complementation assay worked for each round of the screen. stably transduced cells were trypsinised and reseeded. three weeks after reseeding, flasks were examined to identify growing colonies; a representative colony is shown in figure  <dig>  each colony was examined microscopically to ensure it comprised growing cells and the number of colonies obtained for each pool determined. the number of stably transduced cells, the number of flasks reseeded and the number of colonies obtained for each flask at 38°c are shown in additional file  <dig>  the flasks which contained more densely growing/bigger colonies  were trypsinised, replated and used for extracting genomic dna when confluent.

 <dig> out of  <dig> pools yielded healthy growing colonies; pools  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> particularly gave a higher number of colonies which were also larger. pools  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> also yielded colonies but they were smaller. for each pool that contained growing colonies,  <dig> to  <dig> flasks containing the highest number of growing colonies, were reseeded for extracting genomic dna and resulted in a total of  <dig> sub-pools.

identification of shrnamirs
the shrnamir proviral inserts were by amplified by two rounds of nested pcr using psm <dig> specific primers, the amplified products topo cloned and plasmid dna extracted from at least six colonies sequenced to identify all shrnas present within each pool; for some pools, dna from many more colonies was sequenced. the hair pin sequence was determined by searching for the mir- <dig> context and the mir- <dig> loop that are common to all inserts and frame the hair pin. the sequence of the hair pin was used to identify the target gene by searching the psm <dig> data base or by blastn analysis of the ncbi human genome data base . sequences that could not be linked back to the list of hair pin sequences within the open biosystems collection or were not 100% homologous to a gene within genbank were not pursued and are presented in additional file  <dig> 

the rescued shrnamir hair pins identified  <dig> known genes and another  <dig> shrnamirs targetting as yet unidentified loci. for each pool, the number of times that sequence was obtained, the corresponding insert reference, gene name and the number of shrnamir constructs for that gene within the sm <dig> library are shown in table  <dig>  the last column of the table indicates if the recovered insert was a match to a hair pin present in that particular pool  or if it was present within another pool .  <dig> hair pins were isolated from incorrect pools. some inserts were detected several times in multiple pools. for example, the hair pin v2hs_ <dig>  listed within pool  <dig> was also identified from pool  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggesting that there may have been some cross-contamination of the library perhaps during replica plating. however, this was not a problem since the aim of our screen was to identify shrnamirs that are able to bypass senescence and does not depend upon the identity of the pool. since this insert was isolated from so many pools, it could be that it is a strong positive or that it was highly represented within the library and likely to be a false positive.

for each candidate the dna pool from which it was isolated, the insert reference, target gene, frequency of isolation, as well as the number of shrnamir constructs for that gene within the sm <dig> library are indicated. the last column shows if the recovered insert was a match to a hair pin in that particular pool  or if it was from another pool .

pool  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that produced more colonies and colonies that were larger and healthier than others, identified the following genes: pool 13: dynlrb <dig>  farslb, ppargc1a, taok <dig>  cend <dig>  abl <dig>  loc <dig>  tmem <dig>  sirpg, iyd and smcr7; pool 78: prrx <dig>  slc25a <dig>  armcx <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  mrp <dig>  tmem63b, zbtb <dig>  kia <dig> and eif4a1; and pool 82: eif4a <dig>  ccdc <dig>  prickle <dig>  plp <dig>  samd4a, rasa <dig>  tp <dig>  arntl, bcl2l <dig>  adnp <dig>  dsg <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> and arhgap <dig>  moreover, pool  <dig>  one of the pools that gave the best senescence bypass, contained the only shrnamir targetting p <dig>  v2hs_ <dig> identified in the screen, thereby internally validating it.

overlap of the primary candidates of the shrna screen with microarray data for genes up-regulated upon senescence in cl3ecor cells
to prioritise the candidates identified from the primary screen for functional validation, they were compared to genes up-regulated upon senescence and whose expression was reversed when senescence was abrogated upon inactivation of the p <dig> and prb pathways . this identified  <dig> common genes, atxn <dig>  layn, ltbp2/ <dig> and tmem9b. the microarray expression profiling data presented in table  <dig> showed that they were all up-regulated upon senescence growth arrest: atxn <dig> by  <dig>  fold , layn by  <dig> fold , ltbp2/ <dig> by  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  fold  and tmem9b by  <dig>   and  <dig>  fold  respectively. the data in table  <dig> further show that up-regulation of these candidates was reversed when senescence was bypassed upon inactivation of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways by silencing p <dig>  or p21cip <dig>  or by sequestration of the rb family of proteins by hpv <dig> e <dig> or by expression of the dominant negative e2f-db protein.

log <dig> fold changes in gene expression in cl3ecor cells upon senescence arrest are indicated as ga and upon shift up of control temperature insensitive hmf3s cells, from 34°c to 38°c, as hs respectively. also indicated are the data obtained for these genes from cl3ecor cells in which senescence had been bypassed by silencing of p <dig>  or p21cip <dig>  or by inactivation of prb using hpv <dig> e <dig>  or by expression of the dominant negative e2f-db protein.

the identification of tmem9b was particularly remarkable because the microarray analysis has suggested that senescence growth arrest in cl3ecor cells is associated with activation of the nf-κb signalling pathway and tmem9b has previously been shown to be able to activate nf-κb dependent reporter constructs  <cit> . to determine if silencing of tmem9b would bypass senescence,  <dig> gipz lentiviral silencing constructs  targetting tmem9b were obtained, pooled and introduced into cl3ecor cells after packaging as lentiviruses. the gipz lentiviral library contains the same hair pins as the retroviral library but is more stable and the constructs are packaged as lentiviruses rather than retroviruses. lentiviral human gipz lamin a/c shrnamir  was used as a negative control. silencing of tmem9b was clearly able to bypass senescence . moreover each of the constructs was individually able to overcome senescence arrest with v2lhs_ <dig> being the most efficient  <cit> .

to determine if atxn <dig>  layn and ltbp2/ <dig> were also able to directly bypass senescence, lentivirus constructs from the gipz lentiviral shrnamir library were used. the complementation assay for ltbp2/ <dig>  in figure 4b, showed that silencing ltbp2/ <dig> with the one available silencing construct  clearly yielded healthy growing colonies. silencing of atxn <dig> was tested using  <dig> different silencing constructs v2lhs_ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all four constructs were able to overcome senescence and yielded more growing colonies than the lamin a/c negative control . silencing of layn was tested using  <dig> different silencing constructs v2lhs_ <dig> and 118722; both constructs were able to bypass growth arrest and produced growing colonies .

taken together our results showed that silencing of tmem9b, atxn <dig>  layn and ltbp2/ <dig> was able to bypass senescence in the conditionally immortal human fibroblasts.

discussion
to directly identify the downstream effectors of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb pathways crucial for mediating entry into senescence, we carried out a loss-of-function rna interference screen in the conditionally immortal hmf3a human fibroblasts. this identified  <dig> known genes including p <dig> and another  <dig> shrnamirs targetting unidentified loci. comparison of these known targets with genes up-regulated upon senescence in these cells identified  <dig> common genes tmem9b, atxn <dig>  layn and ltbp2/ <dig>  direct silencing of these common genes using lentiviral shrnamirs bypasses senescence in the hmf3a cells. although none of these genes has previously been linked to cellular senescence, tmem9b has been suggested to be an upstream activator of nf-κb signalling which we have found to have a causal role in promoting senescence.

the  <dig> known targets identified by the shrna screen comprise a wide variety of genes but most importantly one of them was the only p <dig> shrnamir  present within this library, thereby internally validating the screen. moreover all of the primary targets were identified from single shrnamirs even though we have subsequently shown that other shrnamirs corresponding to these targets present within the library are able to bypass senescence. it is not clear why other shrnamirs were not isolated in the screen; however this is exactly what has been observed previously by others such as westbrook and colleagues  <cit> . nevertheless it remains to be demonstrated which of the targets identified by the primary screen are able to bypass senescence when assayed individually.

tmem9b was one of the  <dig> genes in common between the shrna screen and genes known to be up-regulated upon senescence in hmf3a cells  <cit> . moreover expression of tmem9b was down-regulated when senescence was bypassed upon abrogation of the p53-p <dig> or p16-prb pathways. tmem9b is a glycosylated protein that localises to lysosome membranes and partially to early endosomes. it has been shown to be a component of tnf signalling and a module shared between the interleukin- <dig> and toll-like receptor pathways. it is also essential for tnf activation of both nf-κb and mapk pathways by acting downstream of rip <dig> and upstream of the mapk and iκb kinases at the level of the tak <dig> complex  <cit> . tmem9b was also identified in a large scale study to identify genes activating nf-κb and mapk signalling pathways  <cit> . these results are all consistent with our finding that in the conditionally immortal hmf3a cells, senescence growth arrest is associated with an activation of nf-κb signalling and suppression of this pathway bypasses senescence  <cit> .

the latent tgfβ-binding protein 2/ <dig>  hair pin sequence was identified from pool  <dig>  up-regulation of ltbp2/ <dig> expression upon growth arrest was reversed when senescence was overcome. ltbps are secreted proteins initially identified through their binding to tgfβ and may be involved in their assembly, secretion and targetting  <cit> . ltbp2/ <dig> in particular has been found to play an essential role in the secretion and targetting of tgfβ <dig>  <cit> . since silencing of ltbp2/ <dig> can bypass senescence in hmf3a cells, it suggests that ltbp2/ <dig> may be linked with the control of cell growth and be playing a role in suppressing tumour progression perhaps through regulation of tgfβ. this is in accordance with the identification of tgfβ as a senescence-inducing factor in the human lung a <dig> adenocarcinoma cells  <cit> . it is also in accordance with several other reports suggesting that tgfβ <dig> is capable of inducing cellular senescence. for instance, stimulation of human diploid fibroblasts with tgfβ <dig> triggers the appearance of senescence associated-β-galactosidase activity and increases steady state mrna levels of senescence associated genes including apo j, fibronectin, and m <dig>  <cit> ; both apo j  and fibronectin are up-regulated in cl <dig> cells upon senescence arrest and this is reversed when senescence is bypassed  <cit> .

ataxin   <dig> was slightly up-regulated upon senescence arrest which was reversed upon silencing of p <dig> and p21cip <dig> or ectopic expression of the dominant negative e2f-db protein. spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by ataxia, seizures and anticipation caused by an intronic attct pentanucleotide repeat expansion. the product of sca <dig> encodes the novel protein, atxn <dig>  previously known as e46l, which is widely expressed in the brain and belongs to the family of armadillo repeat proteins. although clinical features of the disease are well characterized, very little is known about atxn <dig>  atxn <dig> knock down by rnai has recently been shown to cause increased apoptosis in primary cerebellar cultures, implicated in sca <dig> pathogenesis  <cit> . this is in contrast to our finding that silencing of atxn <dig> in hmf3a cells by four different shrnamirs did not cause apoptosis but promoted growth and permitted a bypass of senescence.

layilin  identified from pool  <dig> was  <dig> fold up-regulated upon senescence arrest, which was reversed upon abrogation of the growth arrest by inactivation of either the p53-p <dig> or the p16-prb pathways. moreover two different layn shrnamirs were found to directly bypass senescence in hmf3a cells. layilin is a widely expressed integral membrane hyaluronan receptor, originally identified as a binding partner of talin located in membrane ruffles. talin is responsible, along with its adaptor proteins, for maintaining the cytoskeleton-membrane linkage by binding to integral membrane proteins and to the cytoskeleton. recently layilin has been suggested to play a crucial role in lymphatic metastasis of lung carcinoma a <dig> cells  <cit> .

in addition to the genes described above, a number of other interesting genes particularly taok <dig>  ras4a and armcx <dig> were identified. taok <dig> is a micro-tubule affinity-regulating kinase required for both chromosome congression and checkpoint-induced anaphase delay  <cit> . it is known to activate the p38mapk pathway through the specific phosphorylation of mkk <dig>  this is a complex pathway responsive to stress stimuli and involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis and has been shown to have an important causative role in senescence  <cit> . ras4a encodes a member of the gap <dig> family of gtpase-activating proteins that have been identified to suppress the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in response to an elevation of ca2+ ions. stimuli that increase intracellular ca2+ levels result in the translocation of this protein to the plasma membrane, where it activates ras gtpase activity resulting in ras being converted from the active gtp-bound state to the inactive gdp-bound state and suppression of downstream signalling  <cit> . armcx <dig> encodes a member of the alex family of proteins and may play a role in tumour suppression. this protein contains a potential n-terminal transmembrane domain and a single armadillo repeat; armadillo repeat containing proteins are involved in development, maintenance of tissue integrity and suppressing carcinomas  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the rna interference screen has identified  <dig> known candidate proteins including p <dig> and another  <dig> shrnamirs targetting as yet unidentified loci. although none of them except p <dig> had previously been linked to senescence or known to be downstream effectors of the p53-p <dig> and p16-prb tumour suppressor pathways, directly silencing four of these candidates, tmem9b, atxn <dig>  layn and ltbp2/ <dig> bypassed senescence in cl3ecor cells. it remains to be determined whether direct silencing of any of the other primary candidates will also bypass senescence. any genes that can bypass senescence upon silencing are novel starting points for identifying the signalling networks that act downstream of p <dig> and prb to induce cellular senescence. the genes/proteins identified in the screen are also potential tumour suppressors, and a mechanistic dissection of their mode of action and role in cancer will undoubtedly provide new avenues for further research.
