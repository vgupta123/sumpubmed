BACKGROUND
the rna interference pathways are well-known for their critical roles in post-transcriptional gene silencing, and in triggering chromatin modifications
 <cit> . genetic, biochemical, and structural studies have implicated argonaute  proteins as the catalytic core of the rnai effector complex risc; the first ago gene was identified in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . plant ago proteins are highly conserved basic proteins  with typical structural domains or amino acid motifs. these include a c-terminal piwi  domain with an rnase-h-like fold, a central paz  domain that binds small rnas through the 3' end of the target rna, and a mid domain, located between the paz and the piwi domains, which anchors the 5' phosphate end of small rnas onto argonaute proteins
 <cit> . based on both their phylogenetic relationships and their capacity to bind to small rnas, one can sort these proteins into three groups: i, which is the ago-like subfamily  that bind to micrornas  and small interfering rnas ; ii, the piwi-like subfamily , members of which bind to piwi-interacting rnas ; and iii, the wago subfamily  that bind to secondary sirnas
 <cit> .

ago-small-rna complexes can repress the transcription of genes, target mrnas for site-specific cleavage or general degradation, or block mrna translation into protein. some evidence suggests that argonaute proteins play crucial roles in rna-directed gene silencing, as well as being involved in the developmental regulation of plants
 <cit> . through genomic annotation,  <dig> and  <dig> ago genes have been identified from arabidopsis thaliana and rice , respectively
 <cit> . although some of these ago members have been characterized, most remain unexplored in plants.

wheat  is a globally important crop, accounting for 20% of the calories consumed by humans
 <cit> . research that focuses on mechanisms for developmental regulation at the molecular level is very important for accelerating the progress of wheat improvement. ago proteins, acting as key components in rna-directed gene-silencing mechanisms, play significant roles in developmental regulation
 <cit> . however, little is known about such genes in wheat. here, we cloned and characterized two wheat ago genes and analyzed their temporal and spatial expression patterns. we also investigated their potential involvement in development-specific gene regulation.

RESULTS
cloning of taagos with full-length cdna
we performed a tblastx analysis in the ncbi est  database  with two arabidopsis argonaute genes, ago <dig>  and ago <dig> . two groups of wheat ests proved to be highly homologous to arabidopsis ago <dig> and ago <dig>  based on the conserved regions of their est sequences, we designed specific primers  for cloning the wheat argonaute genes.

rt-pcr  amplification was conducted with the primer combination of taago1-1f and -1r. a 412-bp cdna fragment  was cloned. to elongate the sequence of the wheat argonaute gene, new primers were designed based on the cloned sequence and used in 5'- and 3'-race . although 5'-race analysis was performed several times, no satisfactory results were obtained. therefore, we selected a genome-walking strategy to clone that 5' region. first, the genomic fragment corresponding to the cdna region  was cloned and genome-walking primers  were designed based on the sequence. three rounds of genome-walking  were then conducted to obtain the 3958-bp genomic dna. finally, the 5'-cdna region  was deduced by assembling exons . the 3'-cdna fragment  was analyzed by 3'-race. the full-length cdna was obtained by assembling the three fragments indicated above , and the cdna sequence between ago1-o <dig> and -o <dig> was confirmed by rt-pcr cloning and sequencing. this wheat ago gene  encodes a putative protein of  <dig> amino acid residues, which is highly homologous to rice osago1b , and was designated as taago1b .

using primers taago4-1f and -1r, we cloned a 498-bp wheat cdna fragment via rt-pcr amplification. sequencing results showed that this cdna is very similar to arabidopsis ago <dig>  based on the cloned sequence, we obtained its full-length cdna by 5'- and 3'-race. sequence analysis indicated that the cdna from our wheat ago <dig> is  <dig> bp long and encodes a putative protein of  <dig> amino acid residues. blastx analysis in ncbi revealed that it is highly homologous to arabidopsis ago <dig> . thus, we designated it as taago <dig> .

phylogenetic analyses of ago plant proteins, including those from rice, arabidopsis, and wheat, showed that taago1b and taago <dig> can be classified into two of the three groups described above . taago1b, assigned to group i, shares a high degree of homology with osago1b, taago <dig>  osago1a and atago <dig>  taago <dig>  as part of group iii, belongs to the same monophyletic subclass as rice osago4a, osago4b, and osago6; and arabidopsis atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig>  and atago <dig>  three arabidopsis agos  and two rice agos  were sorted into group ii .

characteristics of taagos
the sequence analysis at expasy 
 <cit>  indicated that taago1b includes  <dig> amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of ~ <dig>  kda and theoretical pi of  <dig> . taago <dig> is  <dig> amino acids long and has a theoretical pi of  <dig>  and a molecular mass of about  <dig>  kda.

both taagos contain typical paz and piwi conserved regions . the paz domain of taago1b is composed of  <dig> amino acids  and shares  <dig> to 95% homology with those of ago <dig> proteins in other plant species. the paz domain of taago <dig> comprises  <dig> amino acids  and has only limited homology with other plant ago <dig> members. the c-terminal piwi domain of taago1b includes  <dig> amino acids , and has high similarity with that domain in other plant ago <dig> members, e.g., osago1b , osago1a , and atago <dig> . the piwi domain of taago <dig>  shares 90%, 85%, and 77% homology with that of osago4a, osago4b, and atago <dig>  respectively. generally, the piwi domain displays a higher degree of similarity among plant argonaute members, which supports a previous report of greater conservation of the piwi domain but a poorly conserved paz domain
 <cit> .

when we aligned the piwi domains of plant agos, including taagos and paralogs in rice and arabidopsis, we detected a trio of conserved metal-chelating amino acids -- aspartate, aspartate, and histidine  -- in both taago1b and taago <dig> . these particular ddh residues play critical roles during the process of rna-directed cleavage of target rnas, acting as a catalytic triad
 <cit> . thus, the inclusion of a ddh triad in both wheat agos suggests that they are functionally similar to previously characterized agos in rna-directed gene silencing. previous research has shown that the conserved histidine at position  <dig>  of atago <dig> is essential for in vitro endonuclease activity
 <cit> ; this residue was also detected in taago1b. by comparison, in taago <dig>  as well as in osago4a, osago4b, atago <dig>  and atago <dig>  the histidine at the 798th position was replaced by proline , whereas in atago <dig> and atago <dig>  that site was switched to serine  and arginine , respectively .

structural modelling of the piwi domain, with the argonaute protein  from pyrococcus furiosus as template, indicated that taagos can fold to a specific α/β structure that is dominated by a central mixed β-sheet and flanked by two long α-helices. here, the three aligned ddh residues  were spatially close to each other and located in the “slicer” site of the piwi domain .

genomic sequence analysis of taago1b and taago4
the genomic dna sequence was analyzed by dna amplification or genome-walking, using specific primers. taago1b included  <dig> introns that varied in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. by contrast,  <dig> introns,  <dig> to  <dig> bp long, occurred in taago <dig> . the largest intron  in taago <dig> was located in the region corresponding to the 5' utr of mrna.

spatial expression patterns of taagos
expression analysis via semi rt-pcr demonstrated that both taago1b and taago <dig> were highly expressed in all examined tissues, including the root, stem, leaf, anther, ovule, and mature seed , as well as in developing wheat kernels . during germination, taago1b and taago <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in embryonic tissues  but only differentially expressed in the endosperm . the transcript level of taago <dig> in the endosperm tissues of germinating wheat seeds was greatly decreased.

changes in taago expression in response to vernalization
to investigate the expression patterns of taagos over time, we harvested wheat leaves at the 1- to 8-leaf stages of development and performed quantitative real-time rt-pcr. expression of taago <dig> was significantly up-regulated in the 2- and 3-leaf stages, while that of taago1b was not obviously changed during our observation period . vernalization treatment  significantly affected their expression patterns, with taago <dig> no longer being up-regulated at the 2- and 3-leaf stages but taago1b being significantly up-regulated at the 6- and 7-leaf stages .

for further examination of the effects of vernalization treatment, we monitored the expression of taagos during cold accumulation. both were induced in the shoot tissues, with expression of taago <dig> being greatly up-regulated at  <dig> to  <dig> d after cold treatment began but induction of taago1b being relatively lower . however, no obvious induction of taagos was detected in root tissues during the cold accumulation . these results indicated that both genes have important roles within the vernalization response, but their functioning might involve different regulatory mechanisms.

in silico mapping of taagos
from a set of wheat aneuploids and deletion stocks, over  <dig> ests have been mapped in the wheat chromosome / chromosome bins
 <cit> . those results are very useful for in silico mapping analysis. through blastn searches, we identified mapped ests that are homologous to wheat ago genes . based on sequence similarities and positions, we were able to map tago <dig> to the long arm of 7d and taago <dig> to the short arm of 3a, 3b, and 3d on the wheat chromosomes.

discussion
regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level plays a critical role in plant development. rnai pathways are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing and chromatin modifications. argonaute proteins comprise a highly conserved family whose members have been implicated in rnai- and related pathways in plants
 <cit> . we isolated two wheat ago genes with full-length cdna, taago1b and taago <dig>  both taagos are basic proteins  with predicted molecular weights of ~ <dig> kda that are similar to other ago members in eukaryotes
 <cit> . argonautes are characterized by two highly conserved domains, paz and piwi, that have important roles during the processes of rnai-mediated gene regulation
 <cit> . the paz domain is a key region that interacts with the 3' end of small rnas and determines the rna-binding specificity of argonautes. the piwi domain binds to the 5' end and also interacts with the target rna
 <cit> . among rice agos, homology of paz domains is relatively lower , whereas the piwi domains are highly conserved and show homologies of >90%
 <cit> . we also found that the piwi domain of agos is highly conserved among arabidopsis, rice, and wheat. that domain exhibits extensive homology to rnase h; some argonaute proteins cleave the target rnas that have sequences complementary to the small rnas
 <cit> . during this process of sequence-specific cleavage, three conserved metal-chelating residues in the piwi domain play critical roles and function as a catalytic triad
 <cit> . in addition, piwi proteins with degenerate active catalytic motifs of ‘d-d-h/d/e/k’ show deduced slicer or slicer-like activity
 <cit> . we detected this conserved ddh triad in both taago1b and taago <dig>  structural modelling indicated that the ddh residues were spatially close to each other and located at the “slicer” site of the piwi domains. these features demonstrate the regulatory functioning of taagos within the rnai machinery.

in plants, rnai-dependent pathways have been widely implicated in the control of gene expression and involvement in various developmental events
 <cit> . components of the rnai machinery participate in the maintenance of undifferentiated cells in the shoot apical meristem , initiation of lateral organ primordia from sam and floral meristems, and the formation of male and female germ cells
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, ago <dig> and ago <dig> regulate the termination of floral stem cells through two micrornas, mir <dig> and mir165/166
 <cit> . in rice, microarray-based expression profiling has shown that the counterparts of arabidopsis ago <dig> and ago <dig> are significantly up-regulated at the onset of floral development
 <cit> . in our study, taago1b and taago <dig> were ubiquitously expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs, but differentially expressed in germinating endosperm tissues. expression of taago <dig> was immediately and greatly decreased in those endosperm tissues after seed imbibition, suggesting that taago <dig> is involved in the rna-directed silencing of certain target genes in the endosperm . moreover, this down-regulation of taago <dig> was consistent with the up-regulation of enzymes during germination, which are necessary for breaking down endosperm starch into sugars to nourish the growing seedlings.

we were also interested to find that taago <dig> was significantly up-regulated in leaves at the 2- and 3-leaf stages, and that this expression pattern was also significantly affected by vernalization treatment. however, neither taago1b nor taago <dig> was induced by treatment at 4°c for  <dig> d. nevertheless, after  <dig> d of cold accumulation, both were significantly up-regulated. this suggested that taago1b and taago <dig> are involved in the rna-directed silencing of certain flowering repressors in shoots during wheat vernalization. in root tissues, no obvious induction of taagos was detected under cold stress, a finding consistent with previous reports that taago <dig>  is not responsive to low-temperature stress, but is significantly regulated by dehydration
 <cit> . thus, our results indicate potential involvement by taago1b and taago <dig> in development-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. this provides insight into probable functions for taagos and serves as a new starting point for further investigations aimed at understanding rnai-dependent gene regulation during seed germination and vernalization in wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
argonaute proteins are key components of rna-directed gene silencing, playing important roles in the regulation of plant development. we cloned and characterized two argonaute genes from wheat, taago1b and taago <dig>  our results suggested they encode functional ago proteins. interestingly, these two genes manifested different patterns of expression during seed germination and plant growth, as well as in response to vernalization treatment. this demonstrates that taago1b and taago <dig> are probably involved in the developmental regulation of wheat plants.
