BACKGROUND
maize production in  <dig> was about  <dig> million tonnes - more than rice or wheat http://faostat.fao.org, and it is likely to become the most important source for human nutrition by  <dig>  <cit> . conventional breeding approaches employing direct phenotypic selection with limited or no knowledge of the underlying morpho-physiological determinants have successfully improved yield  <cit> . maize grain yield and its major components - kernel weight, kernel number per ear, ear number per plant - have been studied by quantitative trait locus  mapping approaches  <cit> . the identified chromosome regions provide a starting point for further decoding the mechanisms affecting maize production. in european maize breeding, early maturity of high yielding varieties is an important breeding goal, since the short growing season limits productivity. therefore, grain dry matter content, as an indicator for early maturity, is a major factor determining maize productivity.

genes directly involved in grain yield, including those associated with grain number , grain weight  and grain filling were identified in rice . further, genes indirectly associated with grain yield via plant height  and tillering  were also identified. these findings underline the important roles of cell cycle, phytohormone signaling, carbohydrate supply, and the ubiquitin pathway and have increased our understanding of grain yield. however, the mechanisms and pathways controlling yield and yield-related traits still remain largely unknown.

genome-scale oligonucleotide arrays have become a powerful tool in detecting the pathways and pathway interactions underlying biological processes. in maize, results on ear and kernel development have been reported  <cit> . however, no results focusing on maize yield or early maturity are available.

our objectives were to investigate the genes and gene networks underlying grain yield in maize, and their interaction with genes underlying grain dry matter content, by employing a newly developed two-step correlation analysis that combines multi-environment field data and transcription profiles.

RESULTS
grain yield-involved genes
the modified f-test with a false discovery rate  of  <dig>   <cit>  revealed that  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  gene-oriented probes representing complementary maize genes were differentially expressed in the parental inbred lines of the  <dig> hybrids. for  <dig>  among them, the fold change was greater  <dig>  and the log- <dig> expression intensity was greater  <dig> . this set of significant differentially expressed genes was subjected to further analyses. the average number of genes differentially expressed between the parents of a hybrid was  <dig>  which equals  <dig> % of the genes on the array .

the mid-parent expression level of  <dig> differentially expressed genes was significantly  correlated with hybrid performance  or heterosis  for grain yield. in step  <dig> of the two-step selection approach ,  <dig> genes were found to be highly significantly  correlated with py or hy. in step  <dig>  additional  <dig> genes were added to the set of grain yield associated genes s. the gene expression of  <dig> genes  was positively and that of  <dig>  negatively correlated with py . note however, that these percentages are based on probes and may overestimate the actual number of differentially regulated genes, because there may not always be a one-to-one relationship between probes and genes.

with information from the swissprot knowledgebase, we found that  <dig> of the grain yield associated genes were identical to known maize genes, including ivr <dig> encoding invertase , glu <dig> , phi <dig> , rbcs , and hdt <dig> encoding histone deacetylase . furthermore, a high correlation  was observed for genes encoding hexokinase  and phosphofructokinase/pfk , a dynamin-related gene , and mz <dig>  well-known as a transcription factor gene involved in the regulation of developmental processes  <cit> .

in a cross validation procedure, three of the seven flint lines and five of the fourteen dent lines were randomly sampled with  <dig> repetitions. on average  <dig> of the  <dig> genes showing the strongest correlation with py in the estimation set were among the set of the  <dig> genes with the strongest correlation in the complete data set. for hy the average number of agreeing genes was  <dig>  this result confirms that the different genetic backgrounds of the inbred lines only marginally contributed to the random error in the correlation analysis.

interaction between grain yield and grain dry matter content associated genes
the negative correlation r = - <dig>  between hybrid performance for grain yield and grain dry matter content was significant . this suggests that the gene networks involved in grain yield and grain dry matter content might be overlapping and negatively interacting with each other. employing the two-step selection approach  we detected  <dig> genes associated with grain dry matter content. a total of  <dig> genes had an influence on both traits and had correlations of opposite sign with regard to grain dry matter content and grain yield . some of these genes were located in the phytohormone signaling pathways  and the flavonoid metabolism .

the grain yield-involved genes are collected in step  <dig>  and step  <dig> . for each gene, mean and fold-change  of mid-parent expression are calculated; the positive  and negative  association to grain yield and grain dry matter content  are also provided.

among the interacting genes, only  <dig> genes were identified in step  <dig>  however,  <dig> more genes were included in step  <dig>  about half of these additional genes were associated with only one trait  at the  <dig>  level, but were highly correlated with a significant gene concerning the second trait.

functional classification of trait-involved genes
to examine the functions of grain yield and grain dry matter content associated genes, these were grouped into functional categories based on the mips functional catalogue . the functional category metabolism contained most of the genes for both traits. for grain yield, it was followed by protein with binding function or cofactor requirement and for grain dry matter content by cell rescue, defense and virulence. furthermore a large number of genes were related to processes involved in energy. in step  <dig> of the selection approach, the additional genes in categories cell cycle and dna processing and cell fate were included in the set of grain yield associated genes, resulting in an enrichment of these two categories. the category cell rescue, defense and virulence included the largest number of genes, which were associated with both traits.

discussion
maize transcriptome at seedling stage
gene expression of the parental inbred lines was profiled at the seedling stage. this strategy largely reduced the variance during plant collection, since seedlings can be grown in large quantities under highly controlled conditions  <cit> . maize seedling transcriptome employed in our study did not take into account important trait-involved genes, which were regulated by developmental and environmental conditions. however, from previous research  <cit>  it is known that grain yield associated genes  were also regulated in ear or kernel development or stress response. this supports the hypothesis that the relative expression patterns of grain yield associated genes have already been established in early development stages  <cit> . therefore the latent efficiency of these genes as determined at the seedling stage is expected to have a direct influence on grain yield.

two-step selection of trait-involved genes
our newly developed two-step correlation approach targets at identifying all genes associated with grain yield and grain dry matter content using our expression and field data. on the one hand, it detects the most relevant genes in step  <dig> using the stringent significance level of p <  <dig> . on the other hand, it also includes further important genes with the less stringent significance level of p <  <dig>  on the basis of co-expression . employing co-expression reduced the number of about  <dig> genes, which were significant at the  <dig>  level, to  <dig>  in conclusion, the two-step approach allows a more focused detection of relevant genes with a possibly important biological significance than solely a low statistical significance level. in step  <dig>  only  <dig> genes associated with both traits were detected. this number would have been too small to examine the interaction between the pathways involved in both traits. however, the additional genes identified in step  <dig> enabled us to decode major interaction networks of grain yield and grain dry matter content .

plant metabolism - sucrose degradation and glycolysis
hexose phosphates derived from sucrose degradation are used to meet the energy and substrate requirements for plant growth. the finding that sucrose degradation was overrepresented in grain yield-involved genes  suggests its significant role in maize production. three genes encoding three types of invertases  and one gene encoding a hexokinase  were found to be positively associated with grain yield . this implies that sucrose degradation is up-regulated in high yielding hybrids, resulting in an increased hexose phosphate pool during the seedling stage . these results coincide with the fact that the strong relationship between invertase activity and growth rate was largely explained by common chromosomal regions co-located with genes encoding invertase and other related enzymes  <cit> .

a considerable number of grain yield associated genes were found to be involved in glycolysis, an integrated  plant metabolism using hexose phosphates . pfk  is the principle enzyme regulating the entry of metabolites into glycolysis  <cit>  through conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate. its encoding gene was positively correlated with grain yield, indicating the up-regulation of glycolysis in high yielding hybrids. this result is supported by the fact that genes encoding alpha and beta subunits of pfp , involved in interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate, were both positively correlated with grain yield. these findings suggest that glycolysis is involved in grain yield, and the up-regulation of glycolysis seems to be a downstream effect of sucrose degradation up-regulation. this results in an increase of hexose phosphate, supplying more energy and more substrates, which are necessary for a strong seedling development. this deduction is supported by the fact that hexoses as well as sucrose have been recognized as important signal molecules in source-sink regulation and balance  <cit> .

the relationship between carbohydrate metabolism and phytohormone signaling is illustrated by the fact that cytokinins enhance the gene expression of cell wall invertase and hexose uptake carriers  <cit> . one gene encoding a beta-glucosidase  providing active cytokinins  <cit> , one gene encoding a beta-glucosidase aggregating factor  and a direct downstream gene of cytokinin  encoding a-type response regulator  <cit>  were positively associated with grain yield . this suggests that up-regulated carbohydrate metabolism could partially be the result of cytokinin signaling regulation.

plant growth - cell expansion and endocycle
the growth of plant tissue generally proceeds in two stages. the first stage is cell division followed by cell expansion until differentiation is completed  <cit> . in an early developmental phase during endosperm development, cell division takes place and then organelle proliferation and cell expansion occur. in a later developmental phase, starch and proteins are deposited into the endosperm tissue. the early developmental phase decides over the final volume of the grain filling and consequently partly over the amount of final grain yield, due to the total cell number and the size of the cells  <cit> . in our results, the marker genes of cell expansion encoding v-type h+atpase  and aquaporins  for water up-take  <cit>  together with expansins  and endo- <dig> -beta-d-glucosidase  for cell wall loosening  <cit> , were positively associated with grain yield . this indicates that probably a high cell expansion rate in the seedling stage and maybe also later in the early phase of endosperm development is associated with high grain yield in hybrids. larger cells, due to an increased cell expansion, have also been observed in maize roots of hybrids compared to their parental inbred lines  <cit> . the high expression of a gene  encoding an ftsz-like protein, which stimulates chloroplast division  <cit> , indicates that hybrids with high grain yield may proliferate more chloroplasts along with cell expansion during seedling development and possibly also during endosperm development. this coincided with the regulation of genes located in the calvin cycle and chlorophyllide a biosynthesis .

dna synthesis, persisting after transition to cell expansion without subsequent cell division , leads to endocycle, which significantly contributes to cell expansion in higher plants . the finding that the functional category cell cycle and dna processing was overrepresented in grain yield associated genes  suggests that this set of genes may play a significant role in grain yield regulation through their influence on endocycle, because most cells used for transcription profiling had already completed the cell division stage. for example, a gene  encoding a dna replication licensing factor and a gene  encoding a subunit of a replication factor were positively associated with grain yield, which suggests that changes in the replication rate lead to alterations in the cell cycle of the hybrids. this deduction is also supported by the fact that several genes encoding enzymes involved in dna repair were positively associated with grain yield. the ploidy level affects the cell size by increasing the metabolic output  <cit> . this supports the hypothesis that up-regulation of sucrose degradation and glycolysis in high yielding hybrids could be the result of a high ploidy level during cell expansion.

the endocycle is mediated by a down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase  activity in cells  <cit> . a gene  encoding a b-type cyclin-dependent kinase  was negatively associated with grain yield, implying that down-regulation of this cdkb could affect endocycle. such a down-regulation could also be realized through less phosphorylation of cdk-inhibitors  by cdkbs  <cit> . another gene  encoding ick/kpr was also positively associated with grain yield, which stimulates the endocycle by decreasing the cdk activity. the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit>  is a further mechanism to decrease cdk activity. the genes  encoding the anaphase-promoting complex  and another gene  which encodes an apc-activating protein and belongs to the ccs52a class  <cit> , were positively associated with grain yield. this suggests that the apc-dependent proteasome pathway may influence the endocycle through the proteolysis of cyclins and regulation of cyclin/cdk complexes. this deduction is consistent with previous results, where higher expression levels of ccs52a coincided with higher levels of endocycle in medicago nodules  <cit> .

cell expansion and endocycle are also controlled by further mechanisms. the orthologue of zmdrp1a  is a positive factor for cell expansion in arabidopsis  <cit> . in our study, it was positively associated with grain yield. in contrast, the orthologue of zmsmt <dig>  in arabidopsis impedes endocycle  <cit> . in our study it was negatively associated with grain yield. this suggests the regulatory role of both genes in cell expansion during the maize seedling stage. recently, a study demonstrated that transcriptional co-activators  play a significant role in controlling leaf cell expansion and the ploidy level  <cit> . from our results, a gene  encoding an orthologue of atmbf1c was highly positively associated with grain yield and had a high fold-change across hybrids. this suggests that zmmbf1c could significantly contribute to grain yield by controlling cell expansion along with regulating endocycle in the maize seedling.

auxin is a phytohormone that regulates cell expansion and has been studied the most among all phytohormones  <cit> . four genes  encoding auxin-responsive factors were associated with grain yield, and also two genes  encoding proteins for iaa modification. furthermore, two genes possibly involved in iaa synthesis were associated with grain yield, indicating that the auxin signaling pathway could directly contribute to grain yield of maize hybrids throughout cell expansion.

overlap of pathways involved in grain yield and grain drymatter content
the fact that some metabolic genes were positively associated with grain yield but negatively associated with grain dry matter content suggests that overlaps exist at the metabolic level. a part of the grain yield associated genes located on regulatory or signaling pathways, such as the ubiquitin pathway or phytohormone pathways , were also associated with grain dry matter content, suggesting that regulatory genes involved in both traits are overlapping. when higher grain yield is achieved in breeding programs by accumulating genes positively associated with grain yield, these overlaps could lead to a decrease in grain dry matter content, resulting in higher post-harvest production costs due to artificial grain drying  <cit> . the selection of lines with a high expression of genes positively associated with one trait but at the same time not negatively with the second trait could result in a simultaneous increase of grain yield and grain dry matter content.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that a high expression of genes involved in cell expansion, assessed at the parental lines of hybrids, was positively correlated with high grain yield of the hybrids. therefore we hypothesize that hybrids with a high cell expansion rate have an advantage in growth and in grain development. at the same time, they probably can also provide more energy and substrates for growth, along with cell expansion. however, due to a negative correlation between grain yield and grain dry matter content, this latent ability of high yielding hybrids has a negative effect on grain dry matter content after harvest. our study greatly extended the understanding of the mechanisms underlying grain yield at the molecular level. the results suggest that selection of inbred lines after transcript profiling at the seedling stage can help increase selection efficiency in maize breeding.
