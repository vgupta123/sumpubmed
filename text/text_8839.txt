BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis starts from diploid spermatogonial stem cells . the sscs, also known as type a single  spg, are located on the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules. the as spg can self-renew or produce the type a paired  spg. after successive divisions, ap spg differentiates, forms chains of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> aligned spg  and migrates along the basement membrane. aal spg differentiates into a <dig> spg that further divides and differentiates into a <dig>  a <dig>  a4intermediates and b spg, which undergoes meiosis after a final mitosis stage  <cit> . the “undifferentiated”  and the “differentiating”  spg differ in the expression profiles of c-k t <cit> . c-kit is allelic to the w locus on mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the 21-exon gene encodes for a 5150 bp transcript, which is translated into a product of 145 kda protein with  <dig> amino acid residues. this product is known as kit  <cit> . kit transduces growth regulatory signals across the plasma membrane and has three main functional regions, the extracellular, the transmembrane and the intracellular domains  <cit> . its transcription process is only activated after binding with kitl expressed by the sertoli cells. the kit/kitl pathway is considered to be crucial for the proliferation, migration, survival and maturation of the germ cells  <cit> . in spite of the  <dig>  kb full-length canonical transcript, two alternative mrnas of c-kit,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in length, exist in the haploid cells of the mouse testis  <cit> . with an open reading frame  that starts in the intron  <dig> of the mouse c-kit, an alternative spermatid-specific c-kit transcript contains all of the downstream exons , encodes for tr-kit   <cit> . the 30 kda tr-kit is found in the residual sperm cytoplasm and it has evident functions in the activation of oocyte during fertilization in mice  <cit> .

c-kit has been a marker for sscs pluripotency lost and its expression continues until meiosis is initiated  <cit> . the expression of protein kit in the male germ cells is contradictory to those of gene c-kit. in early studies, kit expression is detected in type a , intermediate, type b spermatogonia, as well as preleptotene spermatocytes, but not in the undifferentiated spermatogonia  <cit> . more recent studies demonstrate that kit is also expressed as, apr and aal. therefore, whether kit is expressed in spermatogonia and whether kit/kitl activation is a prerequisite for differentiation or not remain to be a question  <cit> . even though the inactivation of c-kit by its specific inhibitor imatinib results in spg self-renewal impairment  <cit> , both kit- and kit+ spermatogonia have exhibited stem cell activities as evaluated by intra-seminiferous transplantation  <cit> . the pou5f1+/kit+ subset of mouse sscs can differentiate into several lines of somatic cells except for sperm cells  <cit> .

we hypothesize that the expression profiles of c-kit in the male germ cells during spermatogenesis are dynamically changed before and after the expected differentiation, and these changes are important for their functional responses to the spermatogenesis-related genes. in this study, we have investigated the expression of c-kit in the immortal cell lines representing the sscs, the differentiating spermatogonia and spermatocytes in hopes of understanding its natural expression patterns. we have also compared the c-kit expression patterns in those cell lines with their corresponding stage testes. the cell line c18- <dig> and  <dig> dpp mouse testes  represent the undifferentiated spermatogonia. crl- <dig> and  <dig> dpp mouse testes  represent the differentiating spermatogonia. crl- <dig> cells represent primary spermatocytes. the  <dig> dpp testes represent a mixture of the undifferentiated, the differentiating, the maturing and the matured germ cells.

ra, an active metabolite of vitamin a, is a vital signaling molecule for normal fetal development, pattern formation, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . ra is considered to be crucial for germ cells to undergo meiosis in both male and female  <cit> . testes of adult vitamin a-deficient mice/rat have seminiferous tubules that only contain sertoli cells, type a spermatogonia and few preleptotene spermatocytes. with a reduced c-kit expression or without stra <dig> expression, the type a spermatogonia will arrest before differentiation   <cit> . administration of vitamin a to these animals results in a synchronized spermatogenesis emerging from type a spermatogonia and an enhanced expression of c-kit <cit> . therefore, ra is a key regulatory factor for c-kit expression.

cell culture
all cells were cultured in the dubecco modified eagle medium/f <dig>  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum . a subcultivation ratio of 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> was applied. media were renewed  <dig> to  <dig> times per week. the cells were frozen in complete growth medium supplemented with 5%  dmso and stored in liquid nitrogen.

mouse testes collection
mice at 5 days post partum ,  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. for rna extraction, testes were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline  and then immersed in “rna-later” stabilization reagent . before protein extraction, testes were washed twice with pbs, transported in iceboxes and stored in −80°c. three batches of animals were used for each experiment.

in vitro tissue culture and ra induction
in vitro tissue culture was carried out according to the methods described by previous study  <cit> . testes from  <dig> dpp,  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp mice were detunicated, cut into small pieces per testis, placed on millicell cm filters  floating on the surface of medium and covered with drops of medium . ra  diluted in ethanol was added to the culture medium to make a final a concentration of  <dig>  μm or 2 μm. tissues were harvested after 24 hours of ra treatment. total rna was isolated using the rneasy mini kit .

in vitro cultured germ cells and ra induction
for germ cell exclusive induction assay, 2 ×  <dig> c18- <dig> or crl- <dig> cells were pre-seeded into t <dig> cell culture flasks separately  overnight before the treatment in full medium . induction media  with a final concentration of 2 μm ra dissolved in ethanol were used in the treatment  group. the same amount of ethanol without ra medium was set up as the control group. after 24 hours of induction, the induction media was removed, cells were washed with pbs twice, and cells were collected and stored at −80°c until analysis. three independent replications were carried out for each experiment.

methods for rna preparation, electrophoresis and northern blot
total rna from cells and testes was isolated using the rneasy mini kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. sizes of rna were estimated by comparing with 2 μg rna millennium size markers  by measuring the distance from each band to the loading well.

dna fragments corresponding to exons 10– <dig> and exons 18– <dig> of the full-length c-kit transcript were obtained by pcr with c-kit specific primers using the  <dig> dpp mouse testis cdna as the template. primers sequences are shown in table  <dig>  amplified dna fragments were inserted into the topo-ta vector . the plasmids were then extracted by qiaprep spin miniprep kit  and were sent to commercial company for sequencing.

exons 10- <dig> probe hybridizes to c-kit extracellular domain coding area. exons 18- <dig> probe hybridizes to c-kit intracellular domain coding area.

rna probes were prepared by maxiscript kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. mrna-complementary  transcripts were synthesized in a 20 μl in vitro transcription system containing 1 μg dna template, 2 μl 10 × transcription buffer, 1 μl 10 mm atp, 1 μl 10 mm ctp, 1 μl 10 mm gtp, 5 μl 800 ci/mmol  utp at a concentration of 10 mci/ml  and 2 μl t <dig> enzyme mix. after purification with nucaway spin columns , the rna probes were hybridized with the blots with rna samples in the ultrahyb ultrasensitive hybridization buffer  at 68°c overnight. the same blot was stripped and re-probed with α32p-labeled beta-actin rna probe as internal control. northern hybridization was performed twice with probes and membranes that were made independently. the sequences of pcr primers and rna probes are shown in table  <dig> 

rapid amplification of cdna ends , cloning and sequencing
the number and size of c-kit mrna expressed in mice cell lines and testis were determined by the northern blot, the existence of these transcripts were further confirmed by race and sequencing. we used the bd-smarter race protocol from bd biosciences clontech  in race analysis. the full-length cdnas was made by joint action of the smarter ii a oligonucleotide and smartscribe reverse transcriptase  in reverse transcription reactions. the first strand of cdna synthesis was obtained from 1 μg total rna. pcr amplification was done with specific primers hit exons 10– <dig> and exons 18– <dig> on the full-length c-kit transcript  in conjunction with universal primers that were provided in the kit. advantage  <dig> pcr kit  was used for the 5′ and 3′ pcr amplification. nested pcr and touchdown pcr were used to safeguard the specificity of the amplification. electrophoresis of the pcr products, bands cutting and gel extraction  were performed. all of the clear race pcr product gel extractions were cloned to ta vector  and sent to commercial company for sequencing. 5′ and 3′ race results were combined to obtain the full-length c-kit transcripts sequence information.

requirement of a good gene specific primer for race: it should be 23- <dig> nt, has 50-70% gc and tm > 70°c, and does not complement to the 3′ of the universal primer mix.

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
total rna  was treated with dnase i  for 15 minutes at room temperature and then reversely transcribed by high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit .

real-time rt-pcr analysis of c-kit was performed with taqman universal pcr master mix and taqman gene expression assays on the abi prism 7900ht real time pcr system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the relative expression level of each target gene was calculated by the comparative ct method and was normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  expression. three c-kit gene-specific probes that hit different parts of the full-length transcript  were used.

real-time rt-pcr analysis for other genes were performed with power sybr pcr master mix and gene specific primers on the abi prism 7900ht real time pcr system, according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the relative expression level of each target gene was calculated by the comparative ct method and was normalized to gapdh expression. the primers of the candidate genes are list in table  <dig> 

each rt-pcr analysis was repeated  <dig> times after gapdh normalization.

western blot
cells and testis tissues were lysed on ice in ripa buffer containing 1% freshly added protease inhibitors. protein electrophoresis and gel bolting were performed with nupage electrophoresis system  following the manufacturer’s instructions. the blotted pcdf membranes were blocked with 5%  non-fat dry milk  and probed for kit at 4°c overnight, using either 1 μg/ml of a monoclonal antibody  directed against the extracellular domain of the kit or a polyclonal antibody  directed against the amino acid near s <dig> of the human kit  followed by the hrp-conjugated secondary antibodies  staining.

protein lysate from kit expressed in human megakaryoblast cell lines  was set up as positive control and protein lysate from kit negative mouse myoblast cell line  was set up as negative control. the same blot was stripped and re-probed with mouse beta-actin primary antibody  as internal control.

immunofluorescence staining of cells
the cover slips with the cells were washed  <dig> times with pbs again and were incubated with 5% normal goat serum  in pbs for 30 minutes before being incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°c. the cells were then incubated with the secondary antibody and mounted with ultracruz™ mounting medium with dapi . the following antibodies were used in this study: the fitc monoclonal rat-anti-mouse kit extracellular domain , the monoclonal rat-anti-mouse kit extracellular domain , the monoclonal rat-anti-mouse kit extracellular domain ; the polyclonal rabbit-anti-human/mouse/rat kit intracellular domain , the polyclonal goat-anti-mouse kit c-terminus  and the polyclonal rabbit-anti-human/mouse kit c-terminus . the secondary antibodies used in this study included: the alexa 488-conjugated goat-anti-rat igg ; the alexa 594-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit igg  and the texas red-conjugated donkey-anti-goat igg .

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed by unpaired two-tail student t test using spss software . all experiments were performed for at least three independent times and a p value of less than  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
transcription of c-kit in cell lines and testes
northern blots revealed at least  <dig> transcripts in the cells and testes . even more c-kit transcripts expressed in c18- <dig>  crl- <dig> and  <dig> dpp,  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testes were assayed by race . the  <dig>  kb transcript expressed in the c18- <dig> cells was not shown by race . four representative transcripts  were illustrated in figure  <dig> and a multiple blast of their sequences was shown in additional file  <dig>  quantitative expression discrepancies  of c-kit among the cell lines and testes of different stages existed. multiple blast assays demonstrated that exons 17– <dig> region was highly conserved in the c-kit transcripts. the four representative transcripts included the full-length canonical transcript , the 3′ end short transcript , the short transcript  and the truncated transcripts  respectively .

quantitative analysis of different transcript expressions in testes and germ cell lines
three sets of specific primers for rt-pcr were designed to detect c-kit transcripts . products from the e7- <dig> primers represented the long transcripts . products from the e20-21primers represented the total transcripts . the ratio of the long transcripts could be calculated as  × 100%. the ratio of the short transcripts  was consequently  × 100%. those produced by e21+ primers represented all transcripts with a long 3′ end except for transcript b . the ratio of the long 3′ utr transcripts was  × 100%. the ratio of the short 3′ utr transcripts was  × 100%.

from  <dig> dpp to  <dig> dpp, expressions of both transcripts a + b and transcripts c + d increased significantly . the ratios of long and short transcripts remained constant . the ratio of long 3′ transcripts jumped from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . from  <dig> dpp to  <dig> dpp, transcripts a + b + c + d increased moderately but transcripts a + c + d decreased. hence, it can be deduced that transcript b must have been enhanced significantly . consequently, since the relative amount of transcripts a + b did not change, the quantity of transcript a must have declined dramatically. the ratio of short transcripts progressed from  <dig> % in  <dig> dpp to  <dig> % in  <dig> dpp . long 3′ transcripts dropped from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  .

primers e21+ did not detect any bands in all three types of cell lines. as a result, all transcripts in these cell lines lacked of the 3′ utr ends. the relative quantity of transcript a was equivalent with transcript b in the cell lines. the expression of type a + b multiplied significantly in crl- <dig>  and then diminished  in crl- <dig> . the ratio of type a + b transcripts was 65%,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in c-18- <dig>  crl- <dig> and crl- <dig> respectively .

translation of c-kit in the testes and male germ cell lines
it was shown that full-length kit  was expressed in crl- <dig> cells and testes except in c18- <dig> cells . with an anti-intracellular antibody, a  <dig> kda kit was expressed in the c18- <dig>  crl- <dig> and all testes . from  <dig> dpp to  <dig> dpp, the  <dig> kda kit increased, but the  <dig> kda kit remained homogenous in the testes . both the c18- <dig> and crl- <dig> cells expressed the intracellular domain of kit  . unlike the crl- <dig> cells, the c18- <dig> cells did not express the extracelluar domain  . in the  <dig> ddp testes, expression of the extracellular domain was very minimal in the germ cells . in the  <dig> dpp testes, a portion of the germ cells adjacent to the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules began to express the membrane domain . in the  <dig> dpp testes, some spermatogonia and spermatocytes were tested positive for membrane domain . in contrast, the nuclear domain was expressed in all stages  in the spermatogonia, spermatocyte and spermatids, but not in the mature spermatozoon . leydig cells highly expressed the nuclear domain of kit in the  <dig> dpp testes .

expression changes of c-kit and other differentiation-related genes in the testes after ra stimulation
 <dig> dpp,  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp mouse testes were treated with either  <dig>  μm or 2 μm ra in vitro for 24 h. quantitative expression of c-kit and sscs differentiation related genes were determined by real-time pcr using three pairs of primers . the total c-kit mrna level increased following the ra treatment and exhibited a concentration-dependent pattern in  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testes . after ra stimulation, the  <dig> dpp testes did not display concentration-dependent increases any more . in  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testes, expressions of cyp26b <dig> and stra <dig> were significantly up-regulated . expressions of dazl and kitl were enhanced moderately in  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testes . bmp <dig> had a different response to ra treatment in testes of different ages .the effects of ra on the expressions of bmp <dig>  cyp26b <dig> and stra <dig> were more significant in the  <dig> dpp testes than that in the  <dig> dpp testes. expressions of rarα and egr <dig> were not altered in either stage .

expression dynamics of c-kit and differentiation-related genes in germ cell lines after ra stimulation
c-kit and other differentiation-related genes changes were analyzed in c18- <dig> and crl- <dig> cells after ra treatment . unlike in the testes, the expressions of all transcripts declined in the c18- <dig> cells after ra stimulation . in crl- <dig> cells, the amount of the long transcripts  declined to about 50% but the quantity of total transcripts  escalated to approximately  <dig> folds, indicating that the short transcripts must have increased even more significantly . expressions of cyp26b <dig> and stra <dig> increased significantly in both c18- <dig> and crl- <dig> cells  . the two germ cell marker genes, dazl and pou5f <dig> had distinctive responses to ra. dazl was boosted in  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testis , but not in either cell lines . pou5f <dig> diminished in c18- <dig> cells but did not change in crl- <dig> cells . egr <dig>  was suppressed in c18- <dig> and crl- <dig> cells , but it was not altered in the testes . rarα  did not respond to ra stimulation.

discussion
a. c-kit transcripts during spermatogenesis
in addition of the conventional full-length c-kit and tr-kit discovered, we also found more than 3c-kit mrna transcripts in the sscs and spermatogonia. crl- <dig> had the highest amount of transcript a . though its quantity increased, the percentages of transcript a declined in crl- <dig> and  <dig> dpp testes when compared with that in c18- <dig> cells and testes at  <dig> dpp . the  <dig> kda kit was also absent in c18- <dig> cells . on this basis, acquisition of this transcript marked the start of the transition from sscs to spermatogonia. the percentage of this transcript decreased in crl- <dig> cells and  <dig> dpp testes. this was caused by the emergence of new short transcripts, which were important for later stage spermatogenesis.

expression of transcript b was the highest in the  <dig> dpp testis . the  <dig>  kb short 3′ utr transcript was composed of  <dig> exons, identical to the full-length transcript. the only difference was that the  <dig>  kb short 3′ utr transcript had a  <dig>  kb shorter 3′ utr than the full-length transcript. combining its abundance in the testes  with the strong positive staining of leydig cells in the  <dig> dpp testes , it could be inferred that this transcript might be a somatic form. functions of 3′ utr included supplying binding sites for micrornas and post-transcriptional regulation. absence of the 3′ end utr in all transcripts in the immortal germ cells  indicated that the 3′ utr modification was lost during immortalization and it might be controlled by testicular somatic factors.

transcript c, encoding the  <dig> kda kit, was stably expressed in the testes . the percentage of the short transcripts  was the highest in the  <dig> dpp testes   and crl- <dig>  . consequently, these transcripts might have significant roles in later stage spermatogenesis beginning from spermatocytes. multiple sequence alignment of c-kit tranascripts was shown in additional file  <dig> 

b. kit profile during spermatogenesis
two forms of kit were discovered in this study: the 145 kda and 50 kda kit. the 145 kda kit was located in the cytoplasm/membrane domain in crl- <dig> cells  but not in c18- <dig> cells. its expression escalated accordingly in the  <dig> dpp,  <dig> dpp,  <dig> dpp,  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testes . unlike the 145 kda full-length kit, the 50 kda kit, possibly the product of transcript c, was expressed in both nuclear and cytoplasm/membrane domains in crl- <dig> cells . the 50 kda kit was stably expressed in the testes . therefore, the 145 kda was indeed the marker for spermatogonia  <cit> . we highlighted here that its location shifted from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then to the membrane domain. this might be vital for the initiation of spermatogenesis in sscs. expression of the extracellular full-length kit on membranes, not in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, endorsed the cells the ability to correspond with kitl signals. hence, this expression played important roles in differentiation initiation. we also demonstrated here that sscs did not have full-length transcript , nor the full-length kit , which agreed with other studies indicating that the activation of the kit/kitl signaling pathway was not required for sscs′ self-renewal  <cit> . kit was initially expressed in the nucleus, and then ventured out to the cytoplasm and then to the membrane domain when sscs became spermatogonia. orf finder comparison of the c-kit putative proteins sequences were shown in additional file  <dig> 

c. ra responses in germ cells and testes
some studies showed that ra directly acts on spermatogenic cells by stimulating stra <dig> and c-kit gene expression, whereas some studies testified that exogenous ra could not stimulate c-kit expression  <cit> . we demonstrated that ra enhanced c-kit expression  in testes. stra <dig>  was also significantly amplified in both cell lines and  <dig> dpp/ <dig> dpp testes . however, the expression pattern of c-kit in the cell lines was different from that in the testes . both long and short transcripts were reduced in c18- <dig> cells after ra stimulation . on the other hand, the long transcripts were reduced whereas the short transcripts were promoted in crl- <dig> cells . we concluded that ra indirectly impacted upon c-kit expression in male germ cells, while some unknown factors from the testes somatic cells might be involved. it agreed with previous works that ra indirectly controlled the timing of meiosis by juxtacrine of sertoli cells  <cit> .

suppression of bmp <dig> by ra was obvious. ra reduced bmp <dig>  expression in  <dig> dpp testes  and did not alter bmp <dig> expression in  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp testes . bmp <dig> was also reduced in c18- <dig> cells after ra stimulation . excessive exogenous ra would push sscs into abnormal differentiation and finally apoptosis  <cit> . our results validified that after 24 hours of 2 μm ra treatment, expression of cyp26b <dig>  was stimulated. this would degrade excessive ra into the inactive form in both cell lines and testes . cyp26b <dig> was not altered in  <dig> dpp testes . the increase of the protective gene also varied in crl- <dig> cells  and in c18- <dig> cells . we confirmed here, again, that stra <dig> was the most immediate responsive gene after ra stimulation. the germ cell marker genes , early growth response gene , and the ra receptor gene  did not respond to ra, especially not when ra was added to testes tissue culture.

CONCLUSIONS
there are dynamic transcription and translation changes of c-kit before and after sscs’ anticipated differentiation. these changes differ between in the cell lines and in the testis. the responses to ra stimulation are different between the cell lines and testis too. as a significant upstream regulatory factor for c-kit expression, ra might play with other unknown factors to precisely regulate the expression profiles of c-kit in order to regulate normal spermatogenesis.
