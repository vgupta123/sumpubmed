BACKGROUND
the application of next-generation sequencing  to transcriptomics analysis, namely rna-seq, has allowed many advances in the characterization and quantification of transcripts. recently, several developments in rna-seq methods have provided an advance in the complete characterization of rna molecules  <cit> . these developments included improvements in transcription start site mapping, strand-specific measurements, gene fusion detection, small/long non-coding rna characterization and detection of alternative splicing events  <cit> . further improvements in rna-seq methods are allowing transcript quantification from very small amounts of cellular materials or single cells  <cit> . in this work we focused on two of the major steps in rna-seq experiments: library sample preparation  and bioinformatics analysis , and their interplay. ngs applications require specific lsp in which fragmented dna or cdna molecules are attached to adapters, pcr amplified and sequenced  <cit> . since different lsps can have a significant impact on downstream analysis and interpretation of rna-seq results  <cit> , therefore it is evident that robust and unbiased library preparation methods are critical. nevertheless it has also become clear that lsps contain biases that compromise the quality of ngs datasets, which can lead to erroneous interpretations  <cit> . the lsps available on the market belong to two main classes: i) unstranded and ii) stranded .

the choice of lsps does not represent the only critical step in rna-seq. indeed, the sequencing data need to be converted into transcript information , and this step requires an accurate selection of the bioinformatics and statistical analysis techniques to be used. the approaches used to quantify known transcripts, i.e. transcripts annotated on the reference genome, and not yet characterized transcripts, i.e. transcripts not associated with an annotation on the reference genome, are different and characterized by different criticalities  <cit> . in this work we focused only on the annotated splice variants. the ba pipelines for the detection of differentially expressed transcripts are characterized by multiple steps  <cit> , and each of them has an influence on the final results. ba pipelines for differential expression can be divided in two categories: i) differential expression based on splice variant quantification, and ii) exon-based differential expression. this work focused on the interplay of lsp and ba on the statistical detection of altde. in detail, we investigated the effect of different lsps , as well as the effect of polya+ selection versus ribosomal depletion, on splice variant detection. furthermore, we compared nugen low input protocol with standard truseq protocol using ba tools for splice variant-quantification  and for exon-level quantification .

RESULTS
we analysed low input rna  lsp and standard/high input rna lsp . sequencing data generated using trueseq unstranded polya+  was used as reference to simplify the comparisons among lsps. this was because  <dig> ng of total rna input material represents the rna quantity that can be at best obtained from a wide range of biological samples, e.g. animal models, biopsies, facs sorted cell populations etc. furthermore, it represents one of the cheaper rna-seq experiments available on the market.

library sample preparation  effects on splice variants detection and splice variants characterization
we observed how standard/high , low  input protocols, polya+ selection and ribosomal rna depletion affect splice variants detection. specifically, we analysed the lsp effect on splice variants coverage/fragment per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped , exons and exon-exon junctions counts. total rna, extracted from the mouse dendritic cell line d <dig>  <cit> , was split in aliquots and converted in libraries using the following sample preparation kits: nugen v <dig>  scriptseq v <dig>  truseq unstranded/stranded . the total rna input material used for nugen v <dig> was  <dig>  ng ,  <dig> ng  and  <dig> ng , while it was  <dig> ng for scriptseq v <dig> ,  <dig> ng  and  <dig> ng  for truseq unstranded, finally  <dig> ng for truseq stranded . all above-mentioned lsps were performed after polya+ selection, but for nugen v <dig> and truseq stranded lsp, which was also used in association with the ribo-zero ribosomal rna depletion . for each experimental condition   <dig> million paired-end reads were collected. the  <dig> million reads for each condition were assembled combining multiple runs . we tested the reproducibility among different sequencing runs using deeptools webserver  <cit> . correlation between different runs was investigated one chromosome at a time, and the results were reported for chromosome  <dig> . data obtained for the other chromosomes provided similar results . runs clustered on the basis of different lsps. ts <dig>  ts <dig> and ss cluster together with a sperman correlation of  <dig> . tss_total clustered together with ts <dig>  ts <dig> and ss with a spearman correlation between  <dig>  to  <dig> . tss clustered with ts <dig>  ts <dig> and ss with a spearman correlation between  <dig>  to  <dig> . nugen runs were the least similar, sharing with ts <dig>  ts <dig>  ss a correlation between  <dig>  to  <dig> . it was also notable that nu <dig> runs were very different with respect nu <dig> and nu <dig> with a correlation between  <dig>  to  <dig> .

reads were mapped against the mouse genome version  <dig> . at least 83% of all reads generated by any of the lsps could be mapped to the reference genome . the percentage of reads characterized by multiple mappings ranged from 7% to 20% in all lsps but in tss_total, for which it went over 40%. mapped reads were associated with their corresponding transcript using ucsc annotation and cufflinks  <cit> , as prototypic method for splice variant quantification. for each experimental condition we retained only the transcripts characterized by fpkm >  <dig>  and average coverage >  <dig> . as reported in figure  <dig>  the number of common detected transcripts was greater than 80% for all lsps but nu <dig> and tss_total. the nu <dig> shared between  <dig> to 91% transcripts with the other lsps but tss_total. over 90% of tss_total transcripts were detectable by other lsps . on the other hand less than 50% of the transcripts detected by the other lsps were also detected by tss_total. similar observation similarly applied to nu <dig> even if at a lower extent.

ts <dig> and ts <dig>  which were the two libraries prepared with trueseq unstranded using respectively  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng of input material, allowed the detection of nearly the same number of transcripts . a possible explanation for the lack of an apparent advantage in using high versus low, polya+ rna input in truseq unstranded libraries might be due to transcript quantification sensitivity. transcripts quantification was done using cufflinks, because steijger et al.  <cit>  showed that it provided a good sensitivity with respect to other methods. however, cufflinks sensitivity was significantly reduced at very low coverage  <cit> . thus, it was speculated that, since polya+ mrnas represented a tiny subset of the total input rna, the increment in input material from  <dig> ng to  <dig> ng was not enough to bring low expressed splice variants in the range of sensitivity of cufflinks for transcript quantification, given as threshold fpkm >  <dig> .

it was notable that the increase of input material affected the overall library yield . the optimal starting material amount to obtain the higher library yield using trueseq  was approx.  <dig> ng of total rna. further increase in the input material significantly reduces the library yield.

effect of polya+ selection versus rrna depletion. all lsps allowed the detection of a similar number of transcripts  except for tss_total, generated using total rna upon ribosomal depletion. in tss_total, the percentage of transcripts was slightly below 46% even if the total percentage of mapped reads did not differ from the other experiments . for this lsp, 41% of the reads were mapped on multiple locations on the genome. this increase in multiple mapping reads was most probably due to non-coding genes, which often are represented in multiple copies in the genome, e.g. trnas, mirna, lincrna, etc. coding transcripts undetectable in tss_total were characterized by low coverage/fpkm distributions in ts <dig>  while the transcripts detected both by tss_total and ts <dig> showed similar coverage and fpkm distributions . we think that, coding transcripts characterized by low expression might not be sampled in tss_total because of the significant reduction of reads mapping to these single copy genes with respect to the other lsps.

transcripts detection in low input protocol. we observed that the number of detected transcripts in nugen v <dig> depends on the amount of input material . it was notable that the library yield increased as the input total rna increased . however, since nugen is a two-steps protocol, the overall library yield depended also on the amount of cdna used in the second step . the number of transcripts in common with the ts <dig> increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> ng of total rna input. moreover, also the number of nugen specific transcripts  increased. the coverage of nugen detected transcripts  was lower than ts <dig> detected transcripts . this effect was particularly evident for nugen specific transcripts . however, the behaviour observed for the coverage did not apply to fpkm distribution . unless for the nu <dig> dataset, nugen detected transcripts showed fpkm distribution  similar to that observed for the ts <dig> dataset .

we analysed coverage and fpkm distributions for ss, tss and ts <dig> with respect to ts <dig> . coverage and fpkm distributions of transcripts in common between ss, tss, ts <dig> and ts <dig> were very similar to each other. on the other side the lsp specific transcripts were always characterized by very low coverage/fpkm distributions . thus, the low coverage for lsp transcripts in common with ts <dig> seemed to be a peculiarity only of data derived from nugen lsp.

we further investigated this point by analysing the raw count distribution for exons belonging to the transcripts detected by nugen and for those transcripts in common with ts <dig> . from this analysis it was clear that exons belonging to transcripts detected by nugen, are characterized by low exon coverage . this was particularly evident for the nu <dig> sample, where the mean of its exon-counts distribution was not shown since the majority of the exons have  <dig> counts . instead, a mean value lower than  <dig> count was observed in samples nu <dig> and nu <dig> . for exons detected by both nu and ts <dig>  the exon counts distribution was lower for nu <dig>  nu <dig>  and nu <dig>  with respect to ts <dig> . the presence of lower coverage for transcripts/exons detected by nugen could represent a critical issue in splice variant differential expression, since it might affect the bioinformatics quantification of the transcripts/exons.

finally we checked the presence of detectable differences in the number of exon-exon junctions in transcripts specific for nu <dig>  nu <dig> and nu <dig> with respect to those in common with ts <dig> . the exon-exon junction counts distribution was narrow for transcripts identified using the nugen lsp with respect to truseq lsp . the average detection ratio of exon-exon junctions was similar in nugen lsp with respect to truseq lsp . considering only splice variant-specific exon-exon junctions, i.e. exon-exon junctions allowing discrimination between different splice variants, the differences in average detection ratio were also negligible .

benchmark datasets
the observations reported in the previous paragraph enlightened that nugen v <dig> influenced transcript quantification in a different way with respect to standard/high input lsps . nugen protocol using  <dig>  ng of input total rna  had a very limited ability  in detecting splice variants with respect to truseq unstranded protocol using  <dig> ng input total rna . the splice variant detection with nugen protocol using  <dig> ng  or  <dig> ng  still remained less efficient than ts <dig> with respect to the other lsps. although nu <dig> lost, with respect to ts <dig>  only 12% of the detected transcripts  it is not generally used in standard experiments because of the higher complexity/cost of the protocol compared to other lsps. nu <dig> represents the best compromise between the need of a low input rna quantity and the number of detected splice variants . therefore, we decided to compare the effect of nu <dig> and ts <dig> on the detection of differential splice variant expression by ba pipelines. to address this comparison we created benchmark datasets where nu <dig> and ts <dig> reads were spiked-in, within a common background made of truseq unstranded data . specifically, to create the backgrounds c1-c <dig> and t1-t <dig> we used reads of  <dig> technical replicates of ts  <dig> and  <dig> ng of starting material respectively . the choice of two different backgrounds was driven by the desire of creating a dataset resembling a biologically replicated experiment. however it should be noted that the two backgrounds were extremely similar  for the detection of number of exons  and expression at exon-level .

we spiked-in reads derived from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million reads of both nu <dig>  and ts <dig> dataset . with this design, we generated a splice variant-level differential expression between c and t groups for  <dig> transcripts .

furthermore, to investigate the dependency of the ba approaches on gene-specific splice variants complexity we constructed a synthetic dataset that also included complex expression composition of splice variants for the same gene . synthetic reads were characterized by having a uniform distribution over all transcripts and  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts between c and t groups were generated .

spikes-in were distributed in both c and t background datasets with respect to two disjoint sets of isoforms, to generate skipping and insertion events resembling biological environmental situation. the differences between backgrounds were negligible  therefore we postulated that swapping spikes-in between c and t backgrounds would not affect the alternative splicing detection, as we indeed observed in our experiments .

all datasets are available at geo repository with the id: gse <dig> 

splice variants differential expression analysis
the identification of differentially expressed splice variants was investigated on the above mentioned datasets using cuffdiff  <cit>  and rsem-ebseq  <cit> , as prototypic for direct splice variants-quantification approaches, and dexseq  <cit> , as prototypic for exon-level analysis.

the selection of two approaches based on splice variant was motivated by the different normalizations used by cuffdiff and rsem-ebseq. cuffdiff normalization is based on fpkm  <cit> , while the combination of rsem and ebseq allows to use raw counts  <cit>  to estimate differential expression between splice variants.

the increase of the number of reads also increased the detection of differentially expressed splice variants, independently of the dataset under analysis, i.e. 20/40/80nu or 20/40/80ts . for cuffdiff we used also the more recent version v <dig>  that includes the estimation of the over-dispersion due to biological replications  <cit> . cuffdiff <dig> detected a fixed number of transcripts independently of the number of the reads used to generate the spikes-in for the ts dataset . otherwise, on the nu dataset the differential expression detection increased on the basis of the number of reads used in the spike-in generation. it was notable that, in 80nu dataset, cuffdiff <dig> detected the same number of alternative spliced transcripts discovered using 20ts dataset. thus, the detection in cuffdiff <dig> seemed to be quite inefficient when nu datasets were used.

in case of cuffdiff <dig>  there was an increment in the detected transcripts that was correlated to the number of reads used to generate the spikes-in; this was observable both in ts and nu datasets . cuffdiff <dig> detected a greater number of differentially expressed transcripts than cuffdiff <dig> in all datasets except for 20ts .

dillies and soneson  <cit>  have shown that fpkm does not represent the best normalization approach for differential expression analysis. cuffdiff <dig> offers two alternative library normalization approaches other than fpkm: geometric and quartile. the geometric normalization is also used in the deseq. we have repeated the cuffdiff <dig> analysis on the 80ts dataset using both geometric and quartile normalization. although there were some differences in the number of the transcripts detected, the overall number of detected spikes-in was not affected by the different normalization procedures . the analysis based on rsem-ebseq  provided a number of detected spikes-in greater than those detected by cuffdiff <dig>  the difficulties in detecting transcripts differentially expressed in nu datasets were still present also using rsem-ebseq but at a lower extent with respect to cufflink. a similar improvement was not observable for the synthetic transcripts. however, the false positive detection was  <dig> times greater than cuffdiff .

the exon-level analysis, performed using dexseq, was quite inefficient with respect to cuffdiff  and rem-ebseq for the nu dataset  and in general in the samples characterized by a low number of input spike-in reads. dexseq detected a higher number of differential expressed transcripts compared to cuffdiff in 80ts . however, dexseq detection rate was lower than rsem-ebseq . indeed 81% of true spikes-in detected in 80ts by rsem-ebseq were associated with a false discovery rate approx.  <dig> times bigger than the one observed using dexseq .

the experiments performed on the synthetic dataset revealed inferior detection efficiency for all methods . the best results were obtained by cuffdiff <dig>  which detected approximately 34% of the total true positive splice variants.

discussion
in this work we present the first comparative evaluation of the combined effect of library sample preparation and bioinformatics analysis on alternative splicing detection.

library sample preparations using as starting material at least  <dig> ng of total rna and undergoing polya+ enrichment , showed a similar behaviour for common detected transcripts. the transcripts detection was significantly impaired for the low expressed transcripts when comparing ribosomal depletion versus polya+ selection protocols.

transcripts that were specifically detected only by a single lsp showed poor coverage and they were probably not very informative for splice variant detection, because of the non-uniform coverage at exon-level. as for nugen low input protocol, the number of lsp-specific transcripts increased with the rise of the amount of total rna input. however, those lsp-specific transcripts were characterized by low coverage and in general by very low exon-level counts. fpkm estimation for those transcripts could be misleading, since it had a very similar behaviour to that observed for the transcripts in common with the lsp based on the truseq protocol. nu <dig>  nu <dig> and nu <dig> showed a lower coverage with respect to ts <dig> for the common transcripts as well as for the exon count. the experiments on the benchmark datasets revealed that the lower exon counts generated from nu datasets  negatively affected the ability of exon-level based approach  to detect alternative splicing events. on the other side, when a high number of input reads was used and the preparation was done using the truseq protocol , the exon-level based approach provided the best results. exon-level analysis provided also the best compromise between detection and false discovery rate using the truseq protocol.

all our experiments were based on 50-bp paired-end sequences. this choice was a compromise between the performance of the experiment and the sequencing costs. however, the optimal solution, as suggested in the  <dig> encode white paper on rna-seq , would have been 76-bp paired-end sequencing, since the average insert size in the majority of lsp is 150-bp. the use of longer reads could be particularly useful in approaches like tophat2/cufflinks, where read splitting is used to detect intron-exon junctions.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that a low input protocol, such as nugen v <dig>  is not suitable for alternative splicing analysis due to the limited coverage at exon-level. moreover the performances of both splice variants-quantification approaches and exon-level analyses were in general comparable. however, it was notable that, for high number of input spike-in reads, exon-level analysis provided a higher detection rate of alternative splicing events with a reduced level of noise.

furthermore, we provide to the research community a dataset that can be re-used as benchmark to compare the performance of software devoted to the identification of alternative splicing events. however, because of the intrinsic characteristics of the short sequencing reads, spikes-in generated by extracting reads mapping to a transcript do not necessarily guarantee that they come from that specific transcript. it was impossible to discriminate between different transcripts when reads mapped to exons that were shared between two or more of them. however, since our benchmark dataset contains also synthetic spike-in the combination of the two different types provides a new benchmarking tool to be used to compare software dedicated to alternative splicing detection.

materials and methods
rna isolation and purification
total rna was extracted from d <dig> mouse cell line  <cit> . total rna was extracted with trizol reagent  followed by rneasy micro clean-up procedure  as per manufacturer's instructions. total rna integrity was assessed by agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  and the rna integrity number  was calculated; rna sample had a rin =  <dig> .

library preparation
the following steps were repeated for all library preparations: 1). ercc rna spike in control mix  <dig>  was added to d <dig> total rna as a first step of each protocol. 2). two additional rounds of purification of the cdna libraries were done using agencourt ampure xp spri beads  to remove >  <dig> bp double stranded cdna. 3). the length distribution of the cdna libraries was monitored using dna  <dig> kits on the agilent bioanalyzer. 4). libraries were subjected to an indexed pe sequencing run of 2x <dig> cycles on an illumina hiseq  <dig> 

illumina truseq rna
illumina truseq rna sample preparation kit version  <dig>  was used with slight modifications. briefly, polya+ containing rna molecules were purified using polyt oligo-attached magnetic beads. thermal fragmentation followed after two rounds of enrichment for polya+ mrna. cdna was synthesized using reverse transcriptase  and random primers. this was followed by second strand cdna synthesis, end repair process, adenylation of 3' ends and ligation of the adapters. the products were then purified and enriched with  <dig> cycles of pcr to create the cdna library.

nugen ovation rna-seq system version  <dig> - dedicated read barcode
total rna was processed for cdna synthesis using ovation rna-seq system version  <dig>  according to the manufacturer's protocol. briefly, first strand cdna was prepared from total rna using a unique first strand dna/rna chimeric primer mix and reverse transcriptase . the primers have a dna portion that hybridizes either to the 5' portion of the poly sequence or randomly across the transcript. a dna/rna heteroduplex double-stranded cdna was generated by fragmentation of the mrna within the cdna/mrna complex, allowing the dna polymerase to synthesize a second strand. the dna then underwent spia amplification. spia cdna were sheared to get a size range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp with the bulk of the material at  <dig> bp. this was done by sonication  with duty cycle  <dig>  intensity  <dig> and cycle/burst  <dig> for  <dig> s.  <dig> ng and  <dig> ng of the sheared dna were used for library preparation using the encore rapid library systems  according to manufacturer's protocol; the fragmented dna underwent end repair, adaptor ligation , and final repair to produce the final library.  <dig> µl of each purified library underwent  <dig> cycles of pcr amplification using illumina truseq pcr reagents.

epicentre scriptseq v1
polya+ containing mrna molecules were selected using ribominus™ eukaryote kit  for rna-seq according to manufacturer's instructions. the rna samples were chemically fragmented using the starscript reverse transcriptase buffer and the cdna synthesis primer was annealed to the rna. 5′ end-tagged cdna  was produced by random-primed cdna synthesis. this was followed by 3′-terminal tagging of the cdna using the terminal-tagging oligo  which randomly annealed to the cdna, including to the 3′ end of the cdna and served as template for the extension of the cdna by dna polymerase. the resulting di-tagged were purified using qiagen minelute pcr purification kit. enrichment of the purified di-tagged cdnas was done with  <dig> cycles of pcr.

illumina truseq stranded total rna
illumina truseq stranded total rna sample preparation kit  was used with slight modifications. the removal of ribosomal rna was done using ribo-zero gold rrna removal beads , which deplete samples of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal rna. after depletion, the rna was purified and fragmented using divalent cations and thermal fragmentation. first strand cdna synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase  and random primers. this was followed by second strand cdna synthesis using dna polymerase i and rnase h and dutp in place of dttp. libraries were prepared as described above for the truseq rna protocol except for the end repair process.

illumina truseq stranded mrna
illumina truseq stranded mrna sample preparation kit  was used with slight modifications. briefly, polya containing mrna molecules were selected using polyt oligo-attached magnetic beads. fragmentation and library preparation was done as described above for the truseq stranded total rna protocol.

spikes-in dataset
the common background of the spikes-in dataset was made using paired-end reads generated preparing, with the truseq unstranded protocol,  <dig> libraries, starting with  <dig> ng of total rna extracted from the d <dig> cell , and  <dig> libraries starting with  <dig> ng of total rna d <dig> cells  . the true positive set  of transcripts was defined in the following way: exon counts for samples c1-c <dig> and t1-t <dig> were loaded in r using dexseq package  <cit>  and ucsc mm <dig> annotation . genes characterized by at least three splice variants were selected . then we selected genes having at least one transcript characterized by at least one exon discriminating it from the other splice variants, for a total of  <dig> genes. the genes were further filtered, removing all transcripts characterized by having, for the discriminating exons, less than  <dig> counts in total in c1-c <dig> and t1-t <dig> samples . out of the  <dig> genes  <dig> were selected, after the inspection of a set of more than a hundred randomly chosen one, and from them one of the splice variant was used for spike-in experiment . sequences , were used to construct three datasets made respectively of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million reads named 20nu, 40nu, 80nu and 20ts, 40ts, and 80ts accordingly. each dataset was mapped against the mouse genome  and the reads mapping to the  <dig> transcripts were extracted and spiked in c1-c <dig> or in t1-t <dig> to simulate transcripts up and down-regulation within two experimental conditions .

it is worth to remark that the selection of the transcripts to be spiked-in is a time-consuming process, due to the complexity in the identification of different types of alternative splicing events  for genes having more than one expressed splice variant. specifically, we selected, as putative targets for spike-in, only those set of splice variant that were expressed both in c and t datasets. this restriction was meant to avoid those cases in which the alternative splicing detection problem reduces to differential gene expression identification.

synthetic dataset
out of the  <dig> transcripts  <dig> were selected, with a similar procedure as above and for each transcript we spiked-in a specific number of reads . since spiking-in the identical amount of synthetic reads in all samples of a replication group would represent an oversimplified experimental design, we selected the number of reads to be spiked-in according to a normal distribution, as could be observed in biological replications. we selected the number of reads to be spiked in each sample on the basis of a normal distribution for  <dig> elements having a mean equal to the number of reads to be spiked-in, e.g.  <dig>  and a standard deviation  <dig> times smaller than the mean. for example, we decided to spike-in  <dig> reads in the  <dig> replicated of ts <dig> background , thus  <dig> random values from a normal distribution of  <dig> elements with mean  <dig> and standard deviation  <dig> were chosen  and used to define the number of spike-in reads to be placed in each of the  <dig> replicates. the required synthetic paired-end reads 2x51nt were constructed to guarantee a uniform distribution both at exon and exon-exon junction level. reads were then associated with a quality score of  <dig> and used to generate fastq files. scripts used to generate the synthetic data set are available upon request.

splice variants quantification and statistical detection of alternative spliced variants
nu <dig>  nu <dig>  nu <dig>  ts <dig>  ts <dig>  ss, tss, tss_total, c-1-c <dig> and t1-t <dig> fastq data were mapped with star   <cit>  using default settings. for nu <dig>  nu <dig>  nu <dig>  ts <dig>  ts <dig>  ss, tss and tss_total splice variant quantification was done with cufflinks   <cit> . exon-level quantification was done using dexseq   <cit>  and exon-exon junction quantification was done with subjunc function of the rsubread   <cit>  bioconductor package. cuffdiff  <dig> , cuffdiff <dig>   <cit> , rsem   <cit> , ebseq   <cit>  prototypic ba based on splice variant-quantification, were used for detection of alternative spliced variants between c1-c <dig> and t1-t <dig> groups using mm <dig> ucsc annotation. all cuffdiff and rsem-ebseq analyses were run with standard parameters, unless in the case of the evaluation of the effect of different library normalization procedures done only with cuffdiff  <dig> . splice variants were considered differentially expressed if characterized by q-value ≤  <dig>  and fdr ≤  <dig> . for rsem-ebseq. exon-level analysis made use of dexseq  <cit> . splice variants were considered differentially expressed if at least one splice variant-specific exon was detected as differentially expressed between c1-c <dig> and t1-t <dig> groups with a benjamini & hochberg adjusted p-value ≤  <dig> .
