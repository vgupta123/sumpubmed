BACKGROUND
direct communication via gap junctions between cells is important for coordinated cellular activity. connexins play a central role in this biological function and contribute to tissue homeostasis and electrical coupling by forming communicating channels between adjacent cells. in general, the significance of connexin expression has been attributed to gap junction coupling. however, recent evidence suggests that connexins may play other roles than being the integral part of gap junction channels. in fact, connexins and/or processed connexin fragments may influence important biological functions like regulation of cell growth  <cit>  and resistance to cell death  <cit>  by mechanisms that do not require gap junction communication  <cit>  but necessitate cytoplasm to nucleus signalling by locally generated messengers.

in brain tissues interneuronal signalling is conveyed by chemical and electrical synapses, the latter being formed by gap junctions. extensive data exists on the nature of locally generated messengers which target to the nucleus serving important function for activity-dependent control of neuronal gene expression during chemical signalling transmission  <cit> . evidence for mechanisms that may play a similar role is entirely missing for electrical synapses.

we chose the photoreceptor/horizontal cell/bipolar cell  complex of the retina to screen for such mechanism for the following reasons:  the prc/hc/bpc complex is endowed with connexins either in form of hemichannels and/or of paired gap junctions  <cit> .  the prc/hc/bpc complex exhibits a remarkable restructuring in response to ambient light exposure, and can be regarded as a model for long-term activity-dependent electrical synapse plasticity  <cit> .  hcs are unique insofar as they reveal a highly restricted pattern of connexin expression. mouse hcs express cx <dig> the orthologue of the human cx <dig>  <cit> . in zebrafish the expression of two related connexins has been described: cx <dig>  and cx <dig>   <cit>  with the latter accumulating in hc dendrites which are involved in the activity dependent plasticity of the prc/hc/bpc complex  <cit> .

all connexin isoforms are presumed to have similar topology, which has been deduced from limited proteolysis and the application of site directed antibodies  <cit> . the nh2-terminal and the cooh-terminal domain are localized in the cytoplasm and are connected by four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops and a cytoplasmic loop. recent evidence indicates that the carboxy-terminus of one of the most abundant connexins  may be involved in gene regulation by either interacting with growth regulators  <cit>  or nuclear-translocation of processed carboxy-terminal domains  <cit> .

the coding region of the zebrafish cx <dig>  lies in a single main exon consisting of  <dig> bp  <cit>  located downstream of two promoters  <cit> . it shares the same topology with other connexins and exhibits an exceptionally long cooh-terminal tail of ~ <dig> amino acids characterized by an unusual clustering of serine residues. thus cx <dig>  provides a likely candidate to look for activity-dependent processing of signalling domains. evidence that some connexins are regulated at the posttranscriptional level initially derived from studies with cx <dig>  cx <dig> or cx <dig>  the 5'-utrs of these connexins contain an internal ribosome entry site , enabling translation in a cap-independent manner  <cit> . additionally, it has been demonstrated that the xenopus cx <dig> 5'-utr contains three upstream open reading frames  that significantly repress translation in young embryos  <cit> .

in the present report, we provide evidence for a unique way of an internal expression of a carboxy-terminal domain of cx <dig> , mediated by a putative ires element present within the coding region. activation of this ires element elicits the processing of an  <dig> kda carboxy-terminal fragment  which could be detected in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the retina in vivo and in heterologous expression systems in vitro suggesting a cytoplasm to nucleus signalling mechanism through a messenger generated from an electrical synapse protein.

RESULTS
cx <dig>  immunoreactivity in the nucleus of horizontal cells and identification of a candidate protein
we have recently reported that cx <dig>  is exclusively expressed in hcs of the zebrafish retina. this was demonstrated using transgenic fish carrying a cx <dig> -promoter driven eyfp transgene and by immunocytochemistry with affinity purified polyclonal antibodies directed against the carboxy-terminal  domain of the cx <dig>  protein  <cit> . in addition to the reported cytoplasmic and membrane-bound localization of cx <dig>  found in hcs of the outer retina as shown in fig. 1a and the additional file  <dig>  we reproducibly observed a low abundant but specific immunoreactivity in the nuclei of hcs. at higher magnification nuclear signals appeared in form of small fluorescent spots distinct from the strong reactivity localized to the cytoplasm and to the plasma membrane . such immunoreactivity was not observed outside the hc layer. control experiments using peptide blocking  or omitting the primary antibody  supported the specificity of our detection approach. in addition we reconstructed z-stack recordings from confocal images using the orthogonal view function of the lsm <dig> meta software . since we were unable to exclude the possibility that the fluorescent signals observed may derive from bleed through fluorescence from out of focus planes we performed immuno-electron microscopy to confirm the specificity of our initial observation. as shown at the ultrastructural level typical membrane-associated cx <dig>  immunoreactivity was frequently found in form of gap junctions between hcs . immunoreactivity found exclusively in the nuclei of hcs appeared in form of small and patchy aggregates . cx <dig>  immunoreactivity was never observed in cells outside the horizontal cell layer. in order to prove the identity of this protein we analyzed retina protein extracts by western blots . the reactivity of our antibody with the full length cx <dig>  protein was exclusive for the retina which is consistent with our previously reported observations  <cit> . in the retina the cx <dig>  antibody reacted specifically with a protein of a molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda. in addition to the full length  <dig> kda protein a small protein product migrating at ~ <dig> kda was reproducibly detected . a yet uncharacterized higher molecular weight band may resemble a protein complex including the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda protein products.

since the antibody applied was generated by immunization with a fusion protein comprising the entire cx <dig>  ct domain  it was reasonable to speculate that the ~ <dig> kda protein derived from the ct of cx <dig> , and may comprise the source for the nuclear reactivity. this assumption was experimentally confirmed using fractionated protein extracts deriving from the retina of adult fish . as expected the full length cx <dig>  protein product resembling an integral membrane protein was restricted to the cytoplasmic cell fraction composed of soluble and membrane proteins . the ~ <dig> kda protein product was found in the cytoplasmic and nuclear extract . note that Î²-actin is depleted in the nuclear fraction as expected . thus, the ~ <dig> kda fragment fulfilled the criteria as candidate protein for the cx <dig>  immunoreactivity observed by the immunohistochemical localization.

full length cx <dig>  and a portion of its carboxy-terminal domain are co-translated
one of several questions raised by our in vivo results was, whether a specific molecular mechanism is responsible for the generation of the ~ <dig> kda protein. in order to identify this mechanism, we analyzed the cx <dig>  coding sequence for alternative protein coding regions and identified several in frame atg codons. in the ct domain three in frame atgs were present starting at nt <dig>  nt <dig> and nt <dig> . although the calculated molecular weight  of the latter protein product  was lower than the experimentally determined ~ <dig> kda found by western blot it appeared possible on the basis of the start codon proceeded by a nearly perfect kozak sequence  that the candidate protein was translated from the in frame atg codon at nucleotide position  <dig>  this hypothesis was tested in vitro. we engineered a fusion construct of the coding region of cx <dig>  with the enhanced green fluorescent protein  using the pegfp-n <dig> vector. after transient transfection into n2a cells, a whole cell extract was prepared  <dig> hours post transfection and subjected to western blot analysis. the cx <dig> -egfp fusion protein with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda  was detected with a monoclonal anti-gfp antibody. repeatedly higher mobility bands became apparent aside of the expected protein including a fusion protein band of ~ <dig> kda . to further confirm that this protein is indeed derived from the ct portion of cx <dig> , we made two additional fusion proteins, one of which corresponds to the full length ct , having its own in-frame atg codon and a second construct that starts from nt <dig> running to nt <dig> . transient transfections into n2a cells and subsequent western blot detection with the anti-gfp antibody showed a band at ~ <dig> kda  corresponding to the full length ct and an additional prominent band at ~ <dig> kda . the dna construct with the cx <dig>  sequence from nt <dig> to nt <dig> showed the expected fusion protein band of ~ <dig> kda . the expression of the ~ <dig> kda fusion protein  fits the criteria of internal translation from an in-frame atg codon at nt <dig> in the coding region of cx <dig> .

the carboxy-terminal protein p11-ct is translated from the cx <dig>  transcript by internal translation
to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for the expression of the p11-ct protein, we introduced a frame shift mutation at nt <dig> in the cx <dig>  coding region. this construct was transiently transfected in n2a cells. western blot detection using the anti-gfp antibody showed that by creating the frame shift, translation of full length cx <dig>  was completely abolished when compared with the non-mutated full length cx <dig>   while the p11-ct protein can be still detected . the disappearance of the full length protein and the persistent expression of p11-ct is a clear indication that a cleavage mechanism cannot be responsible for the generation of this carboxy-terminal protein. in fact, the above results supported our idea that the p11-ct protein is translated from the in frame atg codon at nt <dig>  to test this hypothesis, we changed the in frame atg  to gcg as shown in fig. 3a and expressed the mutation in n2a cells. under this condition, immunoblot detection using anti-gfp antibody showed the presence of full length cx <dig> , while the expression of the p11-ct protein was completely abolished .

an ires element in the coding region of cx <dig>  is responsible for the expression of the p11-ct protein
next, we tested the possibility that a fragment of the coding region of the carboxy-terminus from nt <dig> to nt <dig> contains an internal ribosome entry site . a  <dig> nt fragment ahead of the in-frame atg start codon at nt <dig> was subcloned into the inter-cistronic region of the di-cistronic vector prf-di-cis to generate prf-ir <dig>  the prf-ir <dig> plasmid  and the control prf-di-cis vector  were transiently transfected into n2a cells. renilla  and firefly luciferase  activity were measured  <dig> hours post transfection. luciferase activity readings depicted that the fragment was able to enhance the expression of the downstream located firefly luciferase cistron by ~ <dig> fold as compared to the control vector prf-di-cis . the prf-ir <dig> construct was further transiently transfected into hela and nih3t <dig> cell lines to test whether this putative ires element is also active in other cell lines.  <dig> hours after transfection, luciferase activity was almost similar in hela and n2a cells, while in nih3t <dig> cells the activity was increased ~ <dig> fold compared to the control prf-di-cis vector .

to further delineate the putative ires element, the prf-ir <dig> construct was truncated by removing a ~ <dig> bp fragment from the 3'end of the prf-ir <dig> construct. this new construct prf-ir <dig>  with a shortened cx <dig> -ct domain  along with the construct carrying the entire fragment  and the control prf-di-cis vector were transiently transfected into n2a, hela and nih3t <dig> cells. subsequent luciferase activity determination indicated a substantial overall increase of ires activity. the increase over control levels was ~ <dig> fold in hela, ~ <dig> fold in n2a, and ~ <dig> fold in nih3t <dig> cells . this observation indicates that the dna sequence immediately upstream of the in frame atg codon  exhibits a regulative function on the ires activity.

increased expression of the second cistron in the di-cistronic assay is due to ires activity and not a cryptic promoter
to rule out the possibility that the increased expression of the second cistron in the di-cistronic assay is due to a cryptic promoter activity, promoterless di-cistronic constructs prfÎcmv, prf-ir1Îcmv and prf-ir2Îcmv were prepared from prf-di-cis, prf-ir <dig> and prf-ir <dig> constructs by removing the cmv promoter . each promoterless di-cis construct was transiently transfected into n2a, hela and nih3t <dig> cells. the ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase activity decreased substantially under control conditions as compared to the  <dig> fold to  <dig> fold increase in the ires containing vectors suggesting that the ires element and not a cryptic promoter activity is responsible for the increased expression . the minimal change of the expression ratio of the promoterless di-cis ires vector can be explained by some leaky transcription initiated from the vector backbone.

these findings were confirmed by western blot analysis. for this purpose prf-di-cis, and prf-ir <dig> vectors were modified by removing the firefly luciferase cistron and replacing it with the egfp gene in the position of the second cistron . all constructs were transiently transfected into n2a cells and analyzed  <dig> hours after transfection. immunodetection with anti-gfp antibodies showed an enhanced expression of egfp in the presence of the ires element  as compared to control vector pre . the promoterless control vector, pre-Îcmv  showed a faint expression of egfp which lead credence to our observation of some leaky transcription. promoterless ires vector, pre-ir2Îcmv  showed no expression at all . equal protein loading was confirmed by immunodetection of Î²-actin .

the p11-ct protein is not expressed from a monocistronic mrna
splice variants which may have evaded northern blot detection  due to the lower sensitivity were excluded by rt-pcr. the pcr strategy is outlined in . rt-pcr with the cdna from the control di-cis vector prf-di cis or the ir <dig> containing vector prf-ir <dig> with the primer pair di1/di <dig> generated single amplicons of ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  kbp. the primer di <dig> is located immediately adjacent to the cmv promoter/enhancer element and 5' upstream of the chimeric intron and the hairpin structure included in the vector. the removal of the chimeric intron  from the messages is documented by rt-pcr using the primer di <dig> in combination with the primer di <dig>  as expected no amplification product was generated.

next we performed western blot analysis of n2a cells expressing the control vector pre-dis cis or pre-ir <dig> . we assumed that a cryptic promoter activity should lead to a reduced rluc protein and increased egfp protein expression when egfp is translated from a monocistronic message. in contrast, when both proteins are generated from a single mrna we expected that rluc expression should be unaffected but egfp expression substantially increased in the presence of the ir <dig> element. as shown, simultaneous detection of the renilla luciferase and egfp showed that the translation of the second cistron was greatly enhanced when the ir <dig> element was included in the bicistronic vector. in line with the latter assumption the expression of the first cistron appeared unchanged.

in summary, the results obtained by independent methods conclusively suggest that p11-ct is not expressed from a monocistronic mrna.

the p11-ct product is partially located in the nucleus in vitro
we further addressed the question whether the p11-ct protein showed a subcellular localization in vitro comparable with the in vivo results. in these experiments the large egfp-tag  was replaced in all constructs by the  <dig> amino acid flag-epitope  in order to exclude the possibility that egfp might influence the subcellular localization. we analyzed the distribution of the flag tagged cx <dig>  , fl  and p11-ct protein  products by immunocytochemistry using an antibody specific for the flag epitope  <cit> . the confocal images show that in cells transfected with full length cx <dig>  staining was most abundant in the perinuclear areas with a reduced but consistent staining of most nuclei . at higher magnification this distribution was confirmed . in addition small plaque-like structures were detected at the sites of cell contacts suggesting that flag-tagged cx <dig>  is capable to form junctions between transfected cells . transiently transfected nih3t <dig> cells expressing p11-ct alone showed a protein distribution distinct from cells expressing full length cx <dig> . here, p11-ct was also found both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, however, the nuclear localization was substantially pronounced when compared to the full length cx <dig>  . this experimental finding is consistent with in silicio analyses which predict a potential nuclear localization of p11-ct on the basis of the amino acid composition, physiochemical properties, dipeptide composition and psi-blast using the subcellular protein localization prediction softwares pslip and eslpred . finally, we observed that the fl-mutant of cx <dig>  lacking the p11-ct start site and thus encoding for the full length protein only was found in the perinuclear area and plasmamembrane forming plaque like structures at the cell periphery . in contrast to cx <dig>  and p11-ct, nuclei were devoid of nuclear staining. next, western blots using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts prepared from cx <dig> -flag, fl-flag and p11-ct-flag transfected n2a cells were performed. n2a cells were selected for this experiment in favour of the nih3t <dig> cells shown above due to a higher ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. this experiment confirmed that the full length cx <dig>  and fl proteins were enriched in the cytosolic protein fraction which includes membrane proteins . in the experiment shown no p11-ct protein was detected in this protein fraction. in contrast, a band of ~ <dig> kda translated from the cx <dig>  and p11-ct transfected cells was substantially enriched in the nuclear fraction consistent with our previous observations. the subcellular localization of cx <dig> , fl and p11-ct proteins were consistent with initial experiments performed with the egfp-tagged protein variants  demonstrating that the two different protein tags used in this study had a neglectable impact on the subcellular localization of the cx <dig>  isoforms.

in summary, we provide evidence that an ires-mediated molecular process may account for the generation of a small ct domain of the hc connexin cx <dig> , and that this protein product is potentially capable to translocate into the nucleus both in vivo and in vitro.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we describe that the internal translation involving a putative ires element located in the coding region of connexin cx <dig>  leads to the formation of two alternative protein products in vivo and in vitro. our initial observation of low levels of p11-ct immunoreactivity inside the nuclei of horizontal cells in vivo has led us analyze putative molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of this cx <dig> protein fragment.

by performing sequence analyses of the coding region of cx <dig>  we found several in frame atg codons. three candidate in-frame atg codons in the long carboxy-terminal tail of cx <dig>  were taken into consideration. the mutation analysis confirmed the atg at nucleotide position  <dig> as translation initiation site giving rise to a protein product with a theoretical molecular weight of  <dig> kda in case of internal translation.

on the basis of the above observations we hypothesized that the generation of the p11-ct is achieved by an ires element in the coding region of cx <dig> . since ires mediated activities have been scrutinized recently  <cit>  we performed stringent control experiments to rule out activities of cryptic promoters, rnase cleavage or cryptic splicing. to date the number of ires elements found in connexin genes is limited and those ires elements identified are restricted to the 5'utr of cx <dig>  cx <dig> and cx <dig>  <cit> . more elements have been reported in the 5'utr of other eukaryotic genes  <cit> . the existence of ires elements in the coding region of eukaryotic genes is still a rare observation with only a few reports in the literature  <cit> , where in some examples similarly to the p11-ct the carboxy-terminal domain has been described to be internally translated  <cit> .

supporting data on a nuclear presence of p11-ct come from our in vitro studies which included confocal laser imaging and western blots of nuclear extracts. both demonstrated nuclear localization of the p11-ct fusion protein when transfected in nih3t <dig> cells. different from the transfected cells the abundance is less under in situ conditions and restricted to a subpopulation of horizontal cells. this, however, is as expected, since the amount of physiologically expressed and hence translocated protein must be regarded to be lower in the intact retina as compared to the over-expressing cell lines.

a nuclear localization of a carboxy-terminal domain of a connexin has been already reported in case of cx <dig>  <cit> . a nuclear translocation of carboxy-terminal domains would be of paramount importance as far as gap junction biology is concerned. the existence of a molecular mechanism initiating an internal expression of ct fragments could provide first insight into connexin properties not readily explainable by its channel forming properties. a separate expression of biologically active ct-domains and their nuclear translocation can endow gap junction proteins with the capability of modulating gene expression directly in response to changes in physiological activities and/or pathophysiological challenges.

the biological significance of a separate expression of a ct-domain of cx <dig>  via ires mediated internal translation is still to be established. an argument in favour of a possible functional link between expression of cx <dig>  and retinal activity derives from the observation that both cx <dig>  isoforms are strictly expressed in hcs. most importantly, the cx <dig>  full length protein is known to accumulate exactly at those sites known to undergo a dramatic light dependent reorganization of the postsynaptic compartment of the hc/rc/bpc complex in form of reshaping of the hc dendritic spinules after light withdrawal  <cit> . since these sites have been proven to be responsible for changes of functional responsiveness of the hc/rc/bpc complex accompanying dark adaptation  <cit> , a signalling pathway involving cx <dig>  is suggestive. at present the molecular mechanism involved is unclear but our recent identification of the rna binding polypyrimidine tract binding protein  as interaction partner at the putative cx <dig>  ires element  is suggestive for a mechanism involving the camp/pka signalling pathway  <cit> . furthermore, the basic properties of the p11-ct domain with a calculated pi of > <dig> may resemble properties comparable to the basic dna binding domains of some transcription factor gene families  <cit> . therefore, future studies need to uncover whether the subcellular localization and/or potential dna binding capabilities of p11-ct underlay mechanisms similar to c/ebpdelta  <cit>  or gli <dig>  <cit> , two nuclear transcription factors known to shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus upon activation of a pka-driven pathway.

the described activity of an ires sequence and the translation of the p11-ct fragment of cx <dig>  may resemble a novel regulative mechanism which governs the plasticity of the prc/hc/bc complex. it awaits further exploration to unearth the mechanistic background which links the functional with the molecular side.
