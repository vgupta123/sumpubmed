BACKGROUND
the chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis, where light energy in photons is converted into chemical bond energy, via redox reactions, including inorganic carbon fixation at calvin's cycle, finally yielding energy-rich carbohydrate molecules. therefore, apart from the antennae, photosystem i and ii complexes, which are found in the thylakoid membrane, the chloroplast contains the entire enzymatic machinery for carbohydrate biosynthesis in the stroma. anabolic pathways such as protein, fatty acid, vitamin, and pigment biosynthesis take place in the chloroplast as well, indicating the organelle's ability to synthesize complex molecules. the chloroplast genome maintains a highly conserved organization  <cit>  with most land plant genomes composed of a single circular chromosome with a quadripartite structure that includes two copies of an inverted repeat  that separate the large and small single copy regions   <cit> . the recent surge of interest in sequencing chloroplast genomes has provided a plethora of information on the organization and evolution of these genomes and new data for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships  <cit> .

chloroplast genetic engineering offers numerous advantages, including a high-level of transgene expression  <cit> , multi-gene engineering in a single transformation event  <cit> , transgene containment via maternal inheritance  <cit>  or cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> , lack of gene silencing  <cit> , position effect due to site specific transgene integration  <cit> , and pleiotropic effects due to sub-cellular compartmentalization of transgene products  <cit> . apart from expressing therapeutic agents, biopolymers, or transgenes to confer agronomic traits, plastid genetic engineering has been used to study plastid biogenesis and function, revealing mechanisms of plastid dna replication origins, intron maturases, translation elements and proteolysis, import of proteins and several other processes  <cit> . despite the potential of chloroplast genetic engineering, this technology has only recently been extended to the major crops, including soybean  <cit> , carrot  <cit>  and cotton  <cit> , via somatic embryogenesis, achieving transgene expression in non-green plastids  <cit> . all other previous studies focused on direct organogenesis by bombardment of leaves containing mature green chloroplasts  <cit> . lack of complete chloroplast genome sequences to provide 100% homologous species-specific chloroplast transformation vectors, containing suitable selectable markers and endogenous regulatory elements, is one of the major limitations to extend this concept to other useful crops  <cit> .

the need for sequencing the cotton plastome is obvious, when considering its annual retail value of about $ <dig> billion, making it america's most value-added crop. this is justified by the fact that cotton is the single most important textile fiber grown in  <dig> countries; the us accounts for 21% of the total world fiber production. in 2004– <dig>  us farmers planted 79% of the  <dig> -million hectares of nuclear transgenic cotton. upland cotton, gossypium hirsutum, has the potential to hybridize with g. tomentosum, feral populations of g. hirsutum, and g. hirsutum/g. barbadense  <cit> . therefore, geographical restrictions in planting genetically modified cotton are in place because of reports of pollen dispersal from transgenic cotton plants  <cit> . chloroplast genetic engineering could minimize transgene escape because of maternal inheritance of transgenes  <cit> . in addition, other failsafe mechanisms, including cytoplasmic male sterility could be employed to contain transgenes  <cit> .

the examination of phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms has received considerable attention during the past decade . although there is considerable consensus about the circumscription and relationships among many of the major clades, most molecular phylogenetic analyses have examined numerous taxa but have relied on only a few gene sequences. completely sequenced chloroplast genomes provide a rich source of nucleotide sequence data that can be used to address phylogenetic questions. several recent studies have attempted to use completely sequenced genomes to resolve the identification of the basal lineages of flowering plants  <cit> . use of many or all of the genes from the chloroplast genome provides many more characters for phylogeny reconstruction in comparison with previous studies that have relied on only a few genes. however, the limited number of available whole chloroplast genome sequences can result in misleading estimates of relationship  <cit> . this problem can be overcome as more complete chloroplast genome sequences become available.

in this article, we present the complete sequence of the chloroplast genome of upland cotton, gossypium hirsutum. one goal of this paper is to examine gene content and gene order, and determine the distribution and location of repeated sequences. secondly, the rna editing sites in the cotton chloroplast genome are identified and examined, by comparing the dna sequences with available expressed sequence tag  sequences, because rna editing plays a major role in several lineages of plants  <cit> . lastly, protein-coding sequences from  <dig> genes are used to estimate phylogenetic relationships of cotton with  <dig> other angiosperms.

RESULTS
size, gene content, order and organization of the cotton chloroplast genome
cotton complete chloroplast genome is  <dig>  bp in length , and includes a pair of inverted repeats  <dig>  bp long, separated by a small and a large single copy region of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. there are  <dig> unique genes within the cotton chloroplast genome and  <dig> of these are duplicated in the ir, giving a total of  <dig> genes . furthermore, there are four ribosomal and  <dig> distinct trna genes; seven of the trna genes and all rrna genes are duplicated within the ir. there are  <dig> intron-containing genes,  <dig> of which contain one intron, whereas the remaining two have two introns. the gene order in the cotton plastid genome is identical to that of tobacco, but cotton lacks the rpl <dig> and infa genes. overall, genomic content is  <dig> % gc and  <dig> % at, where  <dig> % of the genome corresponds to protein coding genes and  <dig> % to non-coding regions, including introns and intergenic spacers.

repeat structure
repeat analysis identified  <dig> direct and  <dig> inverted repeats  <dig> bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least 90% . twenty-three direct and  <dig> inverted repeats are  <dig> to  <dig> bp long, and the longest direct repeat is  <dig> bp. most of the direct repeats are within intergenic spacer regions, intron sequences and ycf <dig>  an essential hypothetical chloroplast gene  <cit> . interestingly, a  <dig> bp-long direct repeat was found in the psaa and psab genes, whereas a 34-bp forward repeat was within the rrn <dig> gene, and a shorter,  <dig> bp-long direct repeat was identified in two serine transfer-rna genes that recognize different codons; trns-gcu and trns-uga.

rna editing
comparison of the nucleotide sequences of protein coding genes and est sequences retrieved from genbank revealed that rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpoc <dig>  rps <dig> and ycf <dig> have 100% sequence identity with their respective ests . eleven non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, resulting in a total of nine amino acid changes, were identified within ndhc, rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and clpp compared to respective ests, although their sequence identity was above 98% . surprisingly, there were no synonymous substitutions. all of the five aforementioned genes experienced one or two nucleotide substitutions, apart from the protease-encoding clpp, which had five variable sites. lastly, in all but rpl <dig>  the nucleotide substitutions had an impact on the hydropathy of the amino acid because they changed the amino acids from aliphatic to hydrophilic, and vice versa.

phylogenetic analysis
the data matrix for phylogenetic analyses included  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> taxa , including  <dig> angiosperms and two gymnosperm outgroups . the data set comprised  <dig>  nucleotide positions but when the gaps were excluded there were  <dig>  characters. maximum parsimony  analyses resulted in a single, fully resolved tree with a length of  <dig> , a consistency index of  <dig>   and a retention index of  <dig>  . bootstrap analyses indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> nodes were supported by values ≥ 95% with  <dig> of these with bootstrap values of 100%. maximum likelihood  analysis resulted in a tree with a –lnl =  <dig> . the ml and mp trees had identical topologies so only the mp tree is shown in figure  <dig> 

several major groups were supported within angiosperms and these groups are generally in agreement with recent classifications  <cit> . the most basal lineage was amborella followed by the nymphaeales. the next branch included calycanthus, the sole representative of magnoliids in the data set. this was followed by a strongly supported clade of monocots, represented by members of three different orders . the monocots were then sister to the eudicots with the ranunculales forming the earliest diverging eudicot clade. within the core eudicots there were two major clades, one including the rosids and the second including the caryophyllales sister to asterids. within the rosid clade there were two major groups, the eurosids ii and a group that included the myrtales sister to the eurosids i. gossypium in the malvales was sister to arabidopsis in the brassicales.

discussion
implications for integration of transgenes
we have recently demonstrated stable transformation of the cotton plastid genome and maternal inheritance of transgenes via somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . in contrast to previous reports on integrating foreign genes in tomato and potato chloroplast genomes using tobacco flanking sequences that do not have 100% sequence identity  <cit> , the cotton plastid transformation vector was constructed using the pcr-amplified native cotton 16s/trni-trna/23s sequence. however, regulatory sequences used in the cotton plastid transformation were derived from tobacco or other heterologous sequences. with the availability of the entire cotton chloroplast genome sequence, it should now be possible to utilize endogenous regulatory sequences. species-specific vectors should be effective for plastid transformation, especially in recalcitrant plants, because of transgene integration using flanking sequences with 100% sequence identity and endogenous promoters, 5' & 3'untranslated regions, thereby enhancing transcription and translation of transgenes. also, the complete chloroplast genome provides the option of transgene integration into transcriptionally silent, active or read-through spacer regions for optimal transgene integration.

thus far, transgenes conferring several useful agronomic traits, including insect  <cit> , herbicide  <cit> , and disease resistance  <cit> , drought  <cit>  and salt tolerance  <cit> , phytoremediation  <cit> , as well as cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> , have been stably integrated and expressed, via the tobacco chloroplast genome. using the chloroplast as a bioreactor, vaccine antigens  <cit> , human therapeutic proteins  <cit> , industrial enzymes  <cit>  and biomaterials  <cit>  have been produced successfully in an environmental friendly way. although many successful examples of plastid engineering in tobacco have set a solid foundation for various future applications, this technology has not been extended to many of the major crops, primarily due to the lack of complete chloroplast genome sequences and challenges in achieving homoplasmy in recalcitrant crops.

evolutionary implications
other than the ir, repeated sequences are generally considered to be uncommon in chloroplast genomes  <cit> . furthermore, previous studies based on both filter hybridization and dna sequencing have indicated that dispersed repeats are found more commonly in genomes that have experienced changes in genome organization  <cit> , especially in highly rearranged algal genomes  <cit> . the most extensive examination of repeat structure in angiosperms was performed in legumes  <cit> , which do have a single inversion and in some taxa a loss of one copy of the ir. these repeat analyses identified a substantial number highly conserved repeats ≥  <dig> bp with a sequence identity of ≥ 90%. many of these repeats were located in intergenic spacer regions and introns, with several located in the coding regions of psaa, psab, and ycf <dig>  our examination of repeats in the cotton chloroplast genome  identified similar numbers of repeats as in legumes  <cit> , and these are also located mostly in intergenic spacer regions and introns. repeats in coding regions of cotton are located in the same genes as in legumes. overall, it appears that dispersed repeats are very common in angiosperm chloroplast genomes, even in genomes that have not experienced rearrangements. future comparative studies are needed to determine the functional and evolutionary role these repeats may play in chloroplast genomes.

dna and est sequence comparisons identified many nucleotide substitutions resulting in amino acid changes. based on previous studies of atropa  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> , posttranscriptional rna editing events result predominantly in c-to-u edits. however, analysis of the cotton genome and est sequences indicates that only two of the eleven differences were c-to-u changes, suggesting that most of these changes are not mrna edits but may simply represent intra-species polymorphisms. evolutionary loss of rna editing sites has been previously observed and could possibly be due to a decrease in the effect of rna-editing enzymes  <cit> . additionally, conversions other than c-to-u in cotton, as well as other crops, suggest that chloroplast genomes may be accumulating considerable amounts of nucleotide substitutions, where some genes might accrue more alterations than others, such as the petl and ndh genes that have a high frequency of rna editing  <cit> . therefore, despite the plastome's high conservation, variations occur post-transcriptionally, promoting translational efficiency due to transcript-protein complex binding and/or changes in the chloroplast microenvironment, like redox potential or light intensity  <cit> .

the phylogeny based on  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> angiosperms is congruent with relationships suggested in previous studies . there is strong support for the monophyly all of the major clades of angiosperms, including monocots, eudicots, rosids, asterids, eurosids i, eurosids ii, asterids i and asterid ii. our phylogenetic analyses have greatly expanded the taxon sampling of entire genomes because we included six genomes  that have not been included in recently published phylogenies based on complete chloroplast genomes  <cit> . the sampling is particularly expanded in the rosids with four of the six genomes from this clade. thus, we will focus our discussion of the phylogenetic implications of this expanded analysis on this group.

the rosid clade is very large and includes nearly  <dig> families representing almost one third of all angiosperms. the most recent phylogenies of this group  indicate that there are seven major clades whose relationships still remain unresolved. representatives of three of these major clades are included in our analyses, eurosids i, eurosids ii, and myrtales. the position of the myrtales has been especially controversial with no clear resolution of the relationship of this order to other members of the rosids. our  <dig> gene chloroplast phylogeny  provides strong support for a sister relationship of the myrtales with the eurosid i clade. a three-gene phylogeny of  <dig> angiosperms is congruent with our results  <cit> , although support was very weak. however, a sister relationship between eurosids i and myrtales is in conflict with two other recent phylogenies based on two chloroplast genes , which placed the myrtales sister to the eurosid ii clade with weak support  <cit> . although our results clearly favor a closer relationship of myrtales to the eurosid i clade, expanded sampling of complete chloroplast genome sequences of rosids is needed to resolve this issue, especially since limited taxon sampling can lead to erroneous tree topologies  <cit> .

our chloroplast phylogeny  also supports the sister relationship between the orders cucurbitales and fabales, two of the four nitrogen fixing clades of eurosids i. furthermore, the position of cotton, a member of the order malvales, as sister to arabidopsis in the brassicales, is in agreement with recently phylogenies of the eurosid ii clade  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our complete sequence of the cotton chloroplast genome provides the needed information for expanding chloroplast genetic engineering to this important crop plant. although genome organization of cotton is very similar to other unrearranged angiosperm chloroplast genomes, identification of disperse repeats and potential rna editing sites provides new insights into the evolution of this genome. finally, phylogenetic analyses of sequences of  <dig> protein-coding genes for  <dig> angiosperms suggests that the order myrtales is sister to the eurosid i clade but denser sampling is needed to test this result rigorously.
