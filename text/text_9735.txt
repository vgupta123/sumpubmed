BACKGROUND
differentiation of hes cells requires precise orchestration of modifications at chromatin levels, mitochondrial level and changes in cell architecture. chromatin remodeling is an essential step towards differentiation in the case of pluripotent hes cells  <cit> . embryonic stem cells have open chromatin structure which enables them to differentiate into any lineage  <cit> . two most widely studied chromatin modifications in es cells are  dna methylation catalyzed by enzymes like dnmt3a, dnmt3b, dnmt <dig>  <cit>  and  histone modifications  <cit>  carried out by polycomb group  proteins and trithorax group proteins . the histone modifications by pcg proteins prevent precocious differentiation of es cells  <cit> . pcg proteins may play an important role in the early development, while dna methylation is involved in gene silencing in differentiated cells  <cit> .

pcg proteins modify histones by methylation  and ubiquitinylation, to bring about repression of genes  <cit> . pcg form multiprotein complexes called polycomb repressive complexes  such as prc <dig> and prc <dig>  <cit> . the prc <dig> complex comprises of cbx, bmi <dig>  ring1a, ring1b, phc, which catalyze monoubiquitinylation of lysine  <dig> on histone h2a  <cit> . loss of prc <dig> protein ring1b is embryo lethal, knockout animals for other prc <dig> protein are not embryonically lethal but have several developmental defects  <cit> . the core prc <dig> comprises of suz <dig>  eed and ezh <dig> which catalyze the addition of di-methyl or tri-methyl groups to lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig> . prc <dig> is essential for embryonic development as evident from knockout mice studies, which show that loss of prc <dig> proteins like suz <dig>  ezh <dig> and eed results in embryonic lethality  <cit> .

apart from their requirement for overall development, pcg proteins are involved in proliferation and development of specific cell types like skeletal muscles, neural stem cells, hematopoietic cells  <cit> . pcg proteins such as bmi <dig> and ezh <dig> are often found to be overexpressed in cancer cells  <cit> .

hence, it becomes important to study the dynamics of polycomb group proteins during development of various cell types in humans. the best model to study the pcg expression during early development in humans is differentiating embryonic stem cells. hes cells are pluripotent cells with potential to differentiate into all three lineages viz. endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm  <cit> . previous reports have studied pcg proteins in es cells differentiating into ectoderm and mesoderm  <cit> . recently polycomb mediated histone modifications  at key genes during differentiation of hes cells into pancreatic lineage was reported  <cit> . one of the important area of research has been differentiation of hes cells into functional islet cells for treatment of type i diabetes  <cit> . even though pcg proteins are crucial during differentiation, there are no reports available as yet of dynamics of pcg expression during differentiation into pancreatic lineage.

in the present study, in-house derived hes cell line kind <dig>  <cit>  was differentiated into pancreatic lineage under feeder-free culture system by two strategies viz spontaneous and directed differentiation. the expression of pcg protein transcript ring1a, ring1b, bmi <dig>  cbx <dig>  suz <dig>  ezh <dig>  eed and jarid <dig> was examined during differentiation of kind <dig> and compared to the pattern in adult human pancreatic rna.

RESULTS
differentiation of kind <dig> hes cells
spontaneous differentiation
for spontaneous differentiation, embryoid bodies  were generated from kind <dig> cells as described earlier  <cit> . three representative genes map <dig> , hand <dig>  and mixl  were studied by qrt-pcr from embryoid bodies harvested on day  <dig> and day  <dig>  expression of mixl and hand <dig> gene transcripts was seen, but the expression of map <dig> was low . however, the embryoid bodies did not show expression of gene transcripts specific to pancreatic lineage such as pdx <dig>  sox <dig>  and nkx <dig>  . spontaneous differentiation did not yield cells of pancreatic lineage.

directed differentiation
feeder-free culture of kind <dig> cells
to avoid interference from factors secreted by feeder cells during directed differentiation, kind <dig> cells were cultured on reduced basement matrix geltrex. kind <dig> cells growing on human feeder fibroblast   <cit>  were shifted to grow on geltrex coated culture surface . the feeder-free kind <dig> colonies are circular and large compared to colonies on hff. feeder-free kind <dig> cells were regularly characterized for pluripotency markers at both protein and transcript levels at various passages. feeder-free kind <dig> cells showed expression of oct4a, nanog, sox <dig>  rex <dig> and tert by rt-pcr  and oct4a protein expression was seen by western blot . these cells also showed a normal karyotype post feeder-free culture . thus the kind <dig> cells retain the pluripotency characteristics post feeder free culture.

differentiation of feeder-free kind <dig> cells into pancreatic lineage
initiation of differentiation resulted in upregulation of nanog at day  <dig> while sox  <dig> gene transcript declined . kind <dig> cells underwent epithelial to mesenchymal transition evident from expression of e-cadherin and n-cadherin transcripts . at day  <dig>  n-cadherin showed significant upregulation while e-cadherin was downregulated; later n-cadherin expression remained high as compared to undifferentiated feeder free kind <dig> cells. activin a treatment led to maximal expression of definitive endoderm  specific genes like sox <dig>  foxa <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cerberus and eomesodermin at day  <dig> and as the differentiation continued their expression declined . western blot results for sox <dig> also confirmed definitive endoderm formation . hnf4a expression peaked at day  <dig> suggesting exit from the de  stage and entry into primitive gut tube stage . peak expression of pancreas specific transcripts pdx <dig>  nkx <dig>  and sox <dig> was seen between days 12– <dig> indicating presence of pancreatic lineage cells . pdx <dig> and sox <dig> protein expression was seen at day  <dig> by western blotting . expression of map <dig> , hand <dig> and mesp <dig>  transcripts during directed differentiation was found to be low at day  <dig>  indicating cells differentiated primarily into endoderm lineage. thus, directed differentiation resulted in the formation of cells of pancreatic lineage.

polycomb group protein dynamics during differentiation
we first examined the expression of pcg expression in kind <dig> cultured on hff and under feeder free system, followed by studying pcg expression in differentiated kind <dig> cells.

kind <dig> cultured on human feeder fibroblasts
ring1b expression was highest compared to ring1a, bmi <dig> and cbx <dig> in the prc <dig> group, while among prc <dig> members suz <dig>  jarid <dig> and eed expression was most prominent .

feeder-free kind <dig> cells
the expression of prc <dig> gene transcripts showed similar expression pattern to that seen when kind <dig> cells were cultured on hff. ring1b was significantly expressed more compared to bmi <dig>  ring1a, cbx <dig> while among the prc <dig> suz <dig> was expressed significantly more than ezh <dig>  jarid <dig> and eed .

spontaneous differentiation
ring1a was expressed in high amounts during day  <dig> and day  <dig> of differentiation, while ring1b, bmi <dig> and cbx <dig> was significantly down regulated as compared to undifferentiated kind <dig> cells . of the prc <dig> members suz <dig> gene transcripts was highly expressed at day  <dig>  while ezh <dig>  eed and jarid <dig> were significantly down regulated compared to undifferentiated kind <dig> cells . to test whether the expression of pcg observed is due to suspension culture, the ebs after 7 days in suspension were plated for 10 days. post 10 days, the expression of prc <dig> gene transcripts suz <dig>  ezh <dig>  eed and jarid <dig> were down regulated compared to undifferentiated cells .

directed differentiation
with the onset of differentiation the expression of prc <dig> and prc <dig> proteins changed. prc <dig> transcript ring1b and bmi <dig> remained elevated over the entire duration, while ring1a and cbx <dig> maintained low level of expression . western blotting also showed that bmi <dig> expression increased steadily over the course of differentiation . among the prc <dig> members, suz <dig> gene transcript steadily increased as the cells differentiate into pancreatic lineage. western blotting for suz <dig> shows very low expression in undifferentiated kind <dig> cells, but as the differentiation progresses suz <dig> expression increased . ezh <dig>  a key prc <dig> member with methytransferase activity, at mrna level peaked at day  <dig> . at the protein level, ezh <dig> unlike suz <dig> was expressed in undifferentiated cells and its expression was seen till day  <dig> . eed expression remained low as differentiation proceeded but was  <dig> fold high on day  <dig> . jarid <dig> a member of jumonji family, showed steady reduction in expression compared to undifferentiated kind <dig> cells .

histone modifications
both prc <dig> and prc <dig> proteins repress genes by bringing about histone modifications. we observed increase in levels of histone h2a monoubiquitinylation . we also observed increase in trimethylation of h3k <dig> during directed differentiation .

expression of p19/arf
the expression of p <dig> decreased significantly at day  <dig> and day  <dig> compared to undifferentiated kind <dig> cells . however, expression of p16/ink4a could not be detected in undifferentiated and differentiated kind <dig> cells .

polycomb group protein expression in adult human pancreatic rna
of the prc <dig> proteins, bmi <dig> is expressed higher than ring1a, ring1b and cbx <dig> , while among prc <dig> complex, eed and suz <dig> is expressed to higher amounts while expression to ezh <dig> and jarid  <dig> transcripts is low .

discussion
prc <dig> group proteins have been shown to be dispensable for pluripotency; however they are required during differentiation shown by both in vivo and in vitro studies  <cit> . though importance of pcg proteins during differentiation is known, their expression during differentiation of hes cells into pancreatic lineage has not yet been evaluated. to achieve this, we differentiated kind <dig> via spontaneous differentiation and directed differentiation. ebs showed higher expression of endoderm and mesoderm gene transcript while lower expression of ectoderm gene transcripts was seen. however gene transcripts for pdx <dig>  sox <dig> and nkx <dig>  were not detected in differentiated ebs. hence, kind <dig> cells were differentiated by directed differentiation which involves sequential addition of cytokines to generate cells of pancreatic lineage, and this necessitated culturing kind <dig> cells under feeder free conditions. the pcg gene transcripts profile of feeder-free kind <dig> cells was similar to kind <dig> cells cultured on hff cells.

upregulation of pluripotency controlling gene nanog on day  <dig> indicated that it may be required for endoderm differentiation, in contrast to its role in maintaining undifferentiated state. previous reports have also shown that these transcription factors are involved in lineage specification and differentiation  <cit> . gene transcripts of ectodermal marker , cardiac mesoderm marker  were seen at low level during pancreatic differentiation, indicating differentiation of kind <dig> cells primarily into endoderm lineage. pancreas specific gene transcripts pdx <dig>  sox <dig> and nkx <dig>  were expressed during later stages of differentiation  which was also confirmed by western blotting, indicating the differentiation of kind <dig> cells into cells of pancreatic lineage by directed differentiation.

once the differentiation of kind <dig> into pancreatic lineage was achieved, we studied the expression of pcg proteins. bmi <dig> has been shown to be important for self renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells. bmi <dig> represses the expression of cell cycle inhibitors like p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  leading to proliferation of stem cells  <cit> . bmi <dig> was found to be highly expressed during directed differentiation of kind <dig> cells into pancreatic lineage and this is being reported for the first time. we found the increased expression of bmi <dig> led to decrease in expression of p19/cdkn2d transcript. cbx <dig> and ring1a gene transcript levels remain almost unaltered during differentiation, thus it suggests that cbx <dig> and ring1a may not play important role during endoderm differentiation. ring1b transcript was significantly upregulated during differentiation compared to undifferentiated kind <dig> cells. we found the increased ring1b and bmi <dig> led to increase in h2ak119ub <dig> levels during differentiation. total adult human pancreatic rna also showed higher expression of bmi <dig> than ring1a, ring1b and cbx <dig> thus highlighting role of bmi <dig> in differentiated endodermal cells.

in mice ezh <dig>  suz <dig>  eed and jarid <dig> knockout results in embryonic lethality  <cit> . our data shows that ezh <dig>  eed and suz <dig> transcript expression increased compared to undifferentiated kind <dig> cells during differentiation. on the other hand, jarid  <dig> levels decreased steadily during both directed and spontaneous differentiation, similar to results obtained by earlier groups  <cit> . studies carried out earlier have shown ezh <dig>  eed decrease upon differentiation of mouse es cells  <cit> . also, previous reports that studied expression of pcg proteins in differentiated embryonic stem cells, have used spontaneous differentiation approach to induce differentiation  <cit> . van arensbergen et al.  <cit>  reported that pancreatic progenitors have high levels of h3k27me <dig> which gives them plasticity to differentiate either to acinar or beta cell. prc <dig> proteins eed, suz <dig> and ezh <dig> are actively involved in h3k27me <dig> modification  <cit> . results of the present study show that suz <dig>  ezh <dig> and eed were upregulated during differentiation of kind <dig> cells into pancreatic cells along with an increase in the h3k27me <dig> levels. the expression profile of prc <dig> proteins at the transcript level observed in adult human pancreas is similar to that seen in kind <dig> cells differentiated into pancreatic lineage.

the expression of ring1b, bmi <dig>  ezh <dig>  eed, and suz <dig> gene transcripts during spontaneous and directed differentiated hes cells indicates that changes in pcg expression is not a generalized phenomenon observed during differentiation. the increase in expression of pcg proteins correlated with increase in trimethylation of histone h3k <dig> and monoubiquitinylation at h2ak <dig>  understanding the dynamics of polycomb group proteins during hes cell differentiation may help to design better differentiation strategies in future.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that directed differentiation resulted in generation of cells of pancreatic lineage. our data shows that expression of prc <dig> and prc <dig> members had distinct expression profile depending on whether kind <dig> cells were subjected to directed or spontaneous differentiation. expression of prc <dig> transcripts ring1b and bmi1; prc <dig> transcripts suz <dig>  ezh <dig> and eed, increased during pancreatic differentiation, which resulted in increase in h2ak119ub <dig> and h3k27me <dig> modification. prc <dig> group protein ring1b and bmi <dig> and prc <dig> group protein ezh <dig> and suz <dig> are expressed during differentiation into pancreatic lineage. this study will initiate more research on pcg proteins and their role in cell differentiation.
