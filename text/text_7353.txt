BACKGROUND
infections caused by dermatophytes are widespread, are increasing in prevalence on a global scale, and have been considered a major public health concern in some areas of the world. among dermatophytes, the dimorphic fungus trichophyton rubrum represents the most clinically important species, which accounts for as many as  <dig> % of all dermatophytoses in humans  <cit> . in addition to the well-known superficial infections caused by this organism, such as tinea capitis, tinea corporis, tinea inguinalis, tinea manus, tinea unguium, and tinea pedis, t. rubrum is also responsible for deep dermal invasion in immunocompromised patients  <cit> . moreover, t. rubrum infections are often intractable, and relapses frequently occur after cessation of antifungal therapy  <cit> . the prevalence of t. rubrum infections and the anthrophilic nature of this species make it a good model for the study of pathogenic superficial fungi.

conidia are a primary means of dispersion and provide a safe house for the filamentous fungal genome during adverse environmental conditions. asexual sporulation is an important means of reproduction for t. rubrum. this species can produce numerous pear-shaped or club-shaped microconidia, which are thought to be the primary causative agents of skin and nail infections in humans  <cit> . despite their importance in pathogenesis and physiology, the conidia of t. rubrum remain understudied. the studies on t. rubrum are mainly focused on epidemiology, clinical case reports, strain relatedness, and drug susceptibilities  <cit> . little is known about its genetic and biological characteristics. recently, gene expression during t. rubrum conidial germination was examined by microarray  <cit> , providing insight into important biological and cellular events related to conidial germination. the study show that there is a pool of pre-existing mrnas in dormant conidia that are important in maintaining dormancy and initiating germination  <cit> . however, we still know nothing about the conidial proteome during sporulation and conidial germination. for example, when searching pubmed using "trichophyton rubrum" and "proteomics" as key words, the result returned is "no items found". the situation is extremely incommensurate to the prevalence of infections caused by this organism. because of advances in proteomic technologies and the availability of a database of t. rubrum expressed sequence tags  which contain  <dig> unique ests  <cit> , a global identification of proteins in its dormant conidia is achievable now.

in this study, we described the proteome of dormant t. rubrum conidia using a shotgun proteomics approach, an approach that was successful for large-scale proteomics analyses in several model organisms  <cit> . combining the shotgun strategy with sample prefractionation and multiple enzyme digestion, we identified  <dig> proteins from dormant t. rubrum conidia, which constitute the first global view of the proteome of dormant conidia of dermatophytes. these proteins covered nearly all major biological processes. some spore specific proteins were identified. we hypothesize that these spore specific proteins are related to the survival and dispersal of t. rubrum conidia. we also identified many proteins that were important to conidial germination and the response to environmental conditions. the identification of proteins preserved in conidia may provide stepping stones on the way to further study of the molecular mechanisms of t. rubrum conidial germination and permit a better understanding of the maintenance of conidial dormancy. since it has been proposed that the identification and targeting of conidial germination-specific processes provides an excellent strategy for drug and fungicide development in these pathogenic fungi  <cit> , the present study may provide some clues for further approaches to finding new drug targets.

RESULTS
assessment on the purity of prepared t. rubrum conidia and counting of microconidia and macroconidia
according to the numbers of conidia and hyphal fragments obtained from  <dig> independent counts of 1000-fold diluted conidial suspensions, the purity of prepared conidia was calculated as  <dig> % . this means that amount of conidia in our samples is three orders of magnitude higher than the contaminating hyphal fragments. when counting conidia microscopically, we found that microconidia were the predominant type of conidia produed by t. rubrum isolate bmu  <dig> under conditions used in present study and accounted for approximate  <dig> % of the conidia population. most of microconidia were pear-shaped, while club-shaped microconidia were occasionally observed. cylindrical- or cigar-shaped macroconidia were rarely seen in  <dig> independent samples. detailed numbers of microconidia and macroconidia were shown in additional file  <dig> 

t. rubrum conidia protein identification
a global view of the proteome of t. rubrum conidia was gained through a shotgun proteomics strategy combined with sample prefractionation and multiple enzymes digestion. after combining the ms/ms data generated from all twelve analyses, we were able to assign  <dig> peptides to ms spectra leading to the identification of  <dig> unique proteins from t. rubrum conidia. a complete list of the proteins and peptides identified is available as additional file  <dig>  the overlap of identified proteins between duplicate analyses was approximately 67% . at present, the results from replicate analyses usually overlap by ~70% in most of proteomics studies, and protein and proteome coverage could be dramatically improved when samples were analyzed multiple times  <cit> .

a study conducted recently suggested that multiple enzymatic digestions facilitated the detection of overlapping but distinct sets of proteins and provided a significant increase in the number of protein identifications in a complex proteomic sample  <cit> . figure 1a shows the contribution of the two protease digestion approach, which was used in present experiments for protein identification.  <dig> and  <dig> proteins were respectively identified by using trypsin and proteinase k  digestion. the numbers of proteins specifically identified by two different digestions was  <dig>  accounting for 56% of the  <dig> identified proteins. this showed that different enzymatic digestion can significantly improve proteome coverage, resulting in a more detailed map of the conidia proteome in this case.

the prefractionation can effectively reduce sample complexity thereby increasing detection sensitivity, which is necessary for identifying low abundance proteins  <cit> . here, we adopted centrifugal ultrafiltration to divide the conidia proteome into three fractions based on molecular weight  of proteins. of the  <dig> proteins identified by tryptic digestion, each fraction specifically contributed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins . this collection of proteins accounted for 73%  of total proteins identified by tryptic digestion. similarly, proteins specifically identified from the three fractions accounted for 71%  of all proteins identified by pk digestion . these results suggest that prefractionation by centrifugal ultrafiltration can significantly increase the number of identified proteins. although we could not obtain statistics on the mr distribution of identified proteins in different fractions due to a lack of full length cdna sequences, figure 1b and 1c clearly showed that the samples were effectively separated by centrifugal ultrafiltration.

although trace contamination in conidial samples may lead to the possibility of a very few proteins resulting from hyphal fragments, it is impossible to determine which identified proteins belong to hyphal fragments at present due to lack of protein quantitative information in this work and hyphae-specific proteins database. furthermore, the purity of prepared conidia is high enough to guarantee the reliability of the analysis results.

comparison to non-redundant, eukaryotic orthologous groups, and gene ontology databases
to obtain as much functional annotation information as possible, the identified proteins were compared to those in the ncbi non-redundant  protein database, the eukaryotic orthologous groups  database, and the gene ontology  database . the comparison with the nr database enabled us to assign putative functions to or find homologues from other organisms for  <dig>  identified proteins. the remaining  <dig>  proteins were only weakly similar or not similar to known sequences .

comparison with the go database provided more information on the cellular components and the biological processes of the identified proteins. annotation information was obtained for  <dig>  of the identified proteins through go database comparison, and the cellular distribution of these proteins was shown in figure  <dig>  it was clear that the identified proteins were predicted to cover all main organelles such as nucleus, mitochondrion, plasma membrane, golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum, indicating a reflective sampling of the t. rubrum conidia proteome.

proteins were sorted into main functional classes based on the kog database comparison.  <dig>  of the identified proteins fell into various functional categories, while  <dig>  of the proteins had no related kog based function. functional classification of the identified proteins is summarized in table  <dig>  where almost all categories and major biological processes are represented. this indicates a complex profile of the t. rubrum conidial proteome. furthermore, the complexity of the conidial protein profile suggests that these dormant bodies are not merely a warehouse preserving the genome, and that the maintenance of conidial dormancy may be a considerably intricate and elaborate process. besides maintaining the quiescent status of conidia, these proteins may also be involved in conidiation and conidial germination.

id indicates all proteins identified in our experiments.

cell wall proteins and wall biosynthesis related proteins in conidia
the fungal cell wall is a complex structure composed typically of chitin,  <dig> -β- and  <dig> -β-glucan, and mannoproteins. both conidial and mycelial cell walls contain  <dig> -β-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins, but the percentage of respective components present in the cell walls of the two types of cells can be different  <cit> . in dormant t. rubrum conidia, according to nr or kog annotations, we identified  <dig> proteins that were components of the cell wall or were related to cell wall biosynthesis or remodeling . the presence of the  <dig> -β-glucan synthase catalytic subunit, chitin synthase, and mannosyltransferases in conidia suggests that cell wall synthesis or reorganization may be considerably active during sporulation in t. rubrum, and that the cell wall of t. rubrum conidia, similar to other filamentous fungi, is composed of  <dig> -β-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins.

protein s <dig> exhibits high homology to the protein sequence of ecm <dig>  which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell wall organization protein. ecm <dig> is found in all fungal genomes sequenced to date, and its orthologs are essential for sporulation in yeast  <cit> . a recent study showed that ecm <dig> influenced conidial cell wall biosynthesis in aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> . disruption of ecm <dig> resulted in several morphogenetic aberrations, including:  a defect in conidia separation,  an increase in diameter of conidia associated with an increase in cell wall chitin concentration and  conidia that were sensitive to the absence of aeration during long-term storage. these results suggest that in t. rubrum, ecm <dig> may also play some roles in conidiation, conidial cell wall biosynthesis, and viability of conidia in adverse environmental conditions.

the surface of many fungal conidia is covered by a thin layer of regularly arranged rodlets which are mainly proteinaceous  <cit> , and favor air buoyancy and dispersion of the conidia by air currents  <cit> . the proteins responsible for this rodlet configuration are hydrophobins. the rodlet layer of the conidia of neurospora crassa, beauveria bassiana, and magnaporthe grisea only contain a single type of hydrophobin  <cit> . aspergillus nidulans and a. fumigatus have two conidial hydrophobins, which are roda and dewa, roda and rodb, respectively  <cit> . in t. rubrum conidia, we identified a protein  that is homologous to conidial hydrophobin rodb , but did not find any protein corresponding to roda. based on these results, we hypothesize that the surface of t. rubrum conidia should have a hydropbobic rodlet layer which facilitates its dispersal by air.

protein synthesis in t. rubrum conidia
previous biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that protein synthesis is essential for spore germination in fungi, and that conidial germination cannot take place when protein synthesis is blocked  <cit> . translation was one of the first measurable effects  during conidial germination  <cit> . in dormant n. crassa conidia, high levels of free ribosomes were observed, which in the presence of a carbon source, associated with a pre-existing pool of mrna within  <dig> min to form polysomes  <cit> .

in our result,  <dig> proteins were assigned to "translation" based on kog classification, and accounted for 10% of total identified proteins in t. rubrum conidia . this suggests that proteins involved in translation are relatively abundant in dormant t. rubrum conidia. of  <dig> proteins,  <dig>  were structural components of cytosolic ribosome. as mentioned above, a pool of mrnas are preserved in dormant t. rubrum conidia. when encountering appropriate conditions, such as the presence of a carbon source, these ribosomes could rapidly associate with preserved mrnas to produce proteins required for conidial germination. aside from the structural components of cytosolic ribosomes, we also identified translational initiation factors, elongation factors, and aminoyl-trna synthases in the t. rubrum conidia proteome. in a. nidulans  <cit> , sgda, sgdb, and sgdc respectively encode translation initiation factor eif <dig> subunit, seryl-, and cysteinyl-trna synthase and the phenotypes of these sgd mutants were characterized. at the restrictive temperature, there was no conidial germination in any of the sgd mutants.

in addition to proteins related to cytoplasmic protein synthesis, we also identified some proteins involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis in t. rubrum conidia, including nine structural components of the mitochondrial ribosome, one component of mitochondrial translation elongation factor, and two components of mitochondrial polypeptide chain release factor. unlike the system of cytoplasmic protein synthesis, mitochondrial protein synthesis appears not to be essential for spore germination in some fungi. in n. crassa and botryodiplodia, chloramphenicol and ethidium bromide  did not block conidial germination  <cit> . in t. rubrum, the necessity of mitochondrial protein synthesis for conidial germination has not been evaluated and needs to be further investigated.

dormant t. rubrum conidia metabolism profile
although dormant conidia are in quiescent status which means low metabolic activities and rates of oxygen consumption  <cit> , we identified many proteins belonging to the glycolysis system, subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation machinery in t. rubrum conidia . these results indicate that proteins involved in energy production and carbohydrate metabolism are retained in dormant t. rubrum conidia. early studies demonstrated that spore germination was dependent on the function of the standard, cytochrome-mediated electron transport system in botryodiplodia theobromae and neurospora crassa  <cit> . the presence of cyanide  resulted in a complete block of spore germination. in dormant t. rubrum conidia, some components of all five respiratory chain complexes were identified, including six subunits of complex i , one subunit of complex ii , five subunits of complex iii , three subunits of complex iv , and  <dig> subunits of complex v . this was consistent with dormant n. crassa conidia where all of the enzyme components in this standard pathway, such as cytochrome c oxidase and f1f0-type atp synthase, appeared to be assembled and preserved  <cit> . these results indicate that the cytochrome-mediated electron transport system in t. rubrum conidia may be important for conidia germination, just as in botryodiplodia and n. crassa.

in fungal spores, trehalose may account for up to 15% of the dry mass and has been proposed to serve as a stress protectant  <cit> . systematic mobilization of the trehalose pool is one of the first measurable effects during spore germination, which suggests that it may also act as a reserve carbohydrate needed at the onset of this particular developmental stage  <cit> . two t. rubrum conidia proteins, s <dig> and s <dig>  were involved in trehalose biosynthesis. they were annotated as trehalose-6-phosphate synthase component tps <dig> and trehalose synthase ccg- <dig> respectively. in s. cerevisiae, glucose-6-phosphate plus udp-d-glucose is converted to α,α-trehalose-6-phosphate by tps <dig>  then the latter is converted to trehalose by tps <dig>  <cit> . ccg- <dig> is trehalose synthase of n. crassa and its mrna peaks at the time of initiation of conidiation  <cit> . a ccg- <dig> null mutant produced abnormal morphological spores, suggesting that ccg- <dig> is involved in developmental morphogenesis of the asexual conidiospores. this evidence implies that trehalose is also important for t. rubrum conidia and may be implicated in conidial morphogenesis, as observed in n. crassa.

signalling transduction proteins in dormant conidia
in t. rubrum conidia, we identified  <dig> proteins that were related to a variety of signalling transduction systems such as components of ras-related gtpase pathway, the camp-pka pathway, the calcium signalling pathway, the g-protein pathway, the two-component signal transduction system, and some serine/threonine protein kinase/phosphatases and signal histidine kinases . this reflects the potential complexity of signalling transduction networks in t. rubrum conidia.

currently, three signalling transduction pathways  have prompted intensive efforts on their roles at early stage of spore germination  <cit> . in various fungi, roles of these signalling events in spore germination seemed to be conflicting and variable across species  <cit> . despite the conflicting results from previous studies, once these signalling pathways participated in spore germination, they were usually involved in mediating carbon source sensing, the transition from isotropic to polarized growth, activating metabolic activities, transcription, or protein synthesis  <cit> . the study of the transcriptional patterns on conidia germination in t. rubrum  <cit>  showed that the ras-related gtpase and camp-pka pathways may play roles in conidial germination, and that the two-component signal transduction system may participate in response to changes in extracellular osmolarity during conidial germination. the precise roles of these signalling transduction pathways in maintaining the dormant state of conidia in t. rubrum needs to be studied further.

environmental stress resistance proteins in dormant conidia
resistance to adverse environmental conditions, such as desiccation, heat, and osmotic stress, is one of the most impressive properties of dormant conidia. for example, dry conidia can be stored for a long time without loss of viability, and more than 90% of dehydrated conidia can survive after being heated to 124°c for  <dig> min <cit> . these properties permit conidial survival and dispersal in adverse environments. consistent with these characteristics, we identified  <dig> proteins related to response to various environmental stresses in t. rubrum conidia according to go annotation, including desiccation-, heat-, cold-, oxidative stress-, osmotic stress-, starvation-, drug-, salt stress-, unfolded protein-, metal ion-, dna damage- and general stress-related proteins . the classification of these stress related proteins was somewhat overlapping.

of  <dig> proteins, s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> were implicated in sporulation or conidium formation according to go annotation. s <dig> and s <dig> were annotated as vacuolar protease b and ubiquitin-like protein by go, corresponding to prb <dig> and ubi <dig> of s. cerevisiae  respectively. prb <dig> is one of the major proteolytic catalysts in yeast cell under cellular response to starvation, and cells deficient in prb <dig> showed a considerably reduced sporulation frequency  <cit> . ubi <dig> is required by yeast cells for resistance to stress conditions  <cit> . although the ubi4/ubi <dig> diploids formed viable spores initially, these spores lost viability rapidly. and the ubi4/ubi <dig> diploids were sporulation defective  <cit> . s <dig> was the homologue of catalase <dig> of n. crassa . n. crassa possessed three catalases  which served as hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes and were differentially expressed during the asexual life cycle  <cit> . catalase <dig> activity increased at the end of exponential growth, catalase <dig> activity rose transiently in the aerial hyphae, and catalase <dig> activity augmented many times during formation of conidia. catalase <dig> was found in conidia at a very high concentration and exhibited an unusual resistance to inactivation by temperature and various denaturants. these characteristics make catalase <dig> especially suitable for the spore and its survival.

comparison of dormant conidia proteome with transcriptome
in our previous study on gene expression during t. rubrum conidial germination  <cit> , we identified pre-stored mrnas of  <dig> genes in dormant conidia. these genes showed maximum expression levels in dormant conidia and then expression levels of most of them dropped quickly at the onset of germination. among  <dig> genes, annotation information was obtained for  <dig> through go database comparison. functional annotation suggested that these pre-stored mrnas covered wide range of biological processes, including "response to external or abiotic stimulus", "transcription", "regulation of biological process", "cell communication", "development", and "metabolism", "protein synthesis", and "signalling transduction" etc. these transcriptional analysis results were consistent with our proteomic results that revealed the complexity of dormant conidia proteome.

of  <dig> genes, proteins corresponding to  <dig> genes were identified by the present proteomic analysis . mrna levels of  <dig> genes  were more than 2-fold of reference mrna levels, suggesting their relative high expression levels in dormant conidia  <cit> . other proteins corresponding to remaining genes were not detected in present study. this indicates that either they may be extremely low abundant proteins that can not be detected or they are only synthesized at the activation of germination. we lack direct evidence to assert whether the  <dig> identified proteins are the translational products of pre-stored mrnas in dormant conidia or have existed during sporulation. however, in view of high expression levels of these pre-stored mrnas in dormant conidia and the existence of active polysomes in ungerminated conidia  <cit> , at least partially, these proteins may be the translational products of pre-stored mrnas in dormant conidia. according to functional annotation obtained from nr, go, and kog database comparison, the  <dig> proteins were involved in "response to external stress or stimulus", "rna processing and modification", "transcription regulation", "chromatin structure and dynamics", "metabolism", "signalling transduction", "protein synthesis", "posttranslational modification", and "cell wall biosynthesis". these proteomic analysis results support the conclusions drawn from our previous study that maintenance of dormancy and activation of germination are complicated, and need the participation of various pathways. the attachment of dormant conidia to human skin is essential for establishment of dermatophytes infection. of the  <dig> proteins, s <dig> and s <dig> may be involved in pathogenicity of dormant conidia. s <dig> is a homologue of yeast hsp <dig> which is essential for biofilm formation and related to cell adhesion  <cit> . s <dig> is a homologue of the aspergillus clavatus nrrl  <dig> adhesin according to nr database comparison. the two proteins may be related to attachment of conidia to human skin cell, and are potential virulence factors of t. rubrum conidia.

CONCLUSIONS
we provided the first global view of the t. rubrum conidia proteome by combining shotgun proteomics with sample prefractionation and multiple enzymes digestion. our results show that the proteome of t. rubrum conidia is of considerable complexity, and that proteins involved in nearly all biological processes are preserved in conidia. these results suggest that the maintenance of conidial dormancy is an intricate and elaborate process. conidia are in a dormant, but competent, state. and germination could be readily initiated when conidia encounter the appropriate environmental conditions. this study provides an important dataset that can be used for further understanding the maintenance of dormancy and conidial germination that are important but understudied stages in fungi life cycles.
