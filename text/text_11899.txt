BACKGROUND
fatty acyl-coa reductases  can be divided into two classes that differ with respect to the end-product synthesized, i.e. the aldehyde- and the alcohol-forming enzymes  <cit> . aldehyde-generating far catalyze a two-electron reduction of activated fatty acids, so that fatty aldehydes are formed. such enzymes have been described in pea leaves, green algae and bacteria  <cit> . the fatty aldehydes can be further reduced to fatty alcohols by fatty aldehyde reductases  <cit>  or can be involved in the biosynthesis of hydrocarbons  <cit> . on the other hand, alcohol-forming far catalyze the reduction of activated fatty acids to fatty alcohols. this four-electron reduction takes place in two steps. in the first step an aldehyde is formed, that is subsequently reduced to a fatty alcohol in the second step  <cit> . proteins have been purified and genes encoding alcohol-forming far were identified in plants  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , insects  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and protozoa  <cit> . they usually require nadph as electron donor but in certain organisms like euglena gracilis  <cit>  nadph can be substituted by nadh.

far enzymes of plants are involved in the biosynthesis of cutin, suberin and storage lipids  <cit> . in some insect species long-chain alcohols function as sex or communication pheromones  <cit> . mammalian far enzymes produce alcohols needed for the biosynthesis of wax esters and ether lipids  <cit>  but in the preputial gland long-chain alcohols like 1-hexadecanol can serve as putative chemical signals in sex recognition  <cit> . in birds fatty alcohols are constituent parts of wax esters that are used for cleansing and lubricating of their feathers. the waxes are accumulated in a special holocrine gland, the uropygial gland, that lies between the fourth caudal vertebra and the pygostyle  <cit> . type and composition of these wax esters are dependent on the bird species. for instance, the wax ester secretion of goose contains multi-methyl-branched fatty acids and straight-chain fatty alcohols  <cit> , whereas that of barn owl can contain both, methyl-branched fatty acids and alcohols  <cit> . the secretion of the uropygial gland from chicken is composed of  <dig> -diester waxes, whose biosynthesis is not completely elucidated yet  <cit> . furthermore it was demonstrated that fatty alcohols are possibly involved in the chemical communication of budgerigars  <cit>  and that uropygial glands can play a role in the sexual behavior in domestic chicken  <cit> .

fatty alcohols in the range between  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms are used to produce lubricants, emulsifiers, agrochemical formulations, pharmaceutical and cosmetic products  <cit> . for instance, in western europe about  <dig> thousand tonnes of fatty alcohols were used in  <dig> to produce alcohol ethoxylates  <cit> . production of these alcohols from petrochemical raw material will consume remaining fossil oil resources, hence there is the need of inventing new production technologies in future. for instance, metabolic engineering of oil crops was carried out to increase the yield of fatty acids and to modify the fatty acid composition, so that these crops could achieve the requirements of the producing chemical industry and replace fossil oil  <cit> .

in order to identify new fatty alcohol synthesizing enzymes with catalytic activities suitable for the producing chemical industry, we investigated the uropygial glands of barn owl, domestic chicken and domestic goose. in this study we report on the identification of avian far sequences by similarity-based sequence search, on the heterologous expression of the genes in yeast, and on the catalytic properties of the recombinant enzymes.

RESULTS
identification and isolation of far sequences from uropygial glands
based on sequence similarity with far proteins of mammals and jojoba, two putative far sequences of chicken, far <dig> and far <dig> , were identified. to clone the cdna sequences, mrna was isolated from the uropygial glands and used to amplify the far sequences by rt-pcr with gene specific primers. resulting cdnas were analyzed and finally cloned into yeast expression vectors. analyses of the cdna sequences from chicken showed that they encoded amino acid sequences with conservative substitutions in one  or in two sites  compared to the database sequences. furthermore a splicing variant of far <dig> , termed ggfar <dig>  was identified. moreover barn owl and goose were found to possess putative far sequences very similar to those of chicken. two cdna sequences of barn owl, named tafar <dig> and tafar <dig>  and one of goose, termed adfar <dig>  were additionally amplified from the uropygial glands . in contrast to barn owl and chicken, we failed to clone a far <dig> sequence from the uropygial gland of goose.

sequence analysis showed that all avian far proteins had two conserved domains, the nadb-rossmann superfamily domain  and the far_c superfamily domain  and one predicted transmembrane region at the c-terminus . far enzymes of mammals have been shown to possess domain patterns similar to those of avian far while those of plants appear to lack the transmembrane region   <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of far amino acid sequences of birds and other organisms resulted in a bootstrap consensus tree shown in figure  <dig>  it turned out that the avian sequences could be divided into two groups. adfar <dig>  ggfar <dig>  tafar <dig> and ggfar1db shared high sequence identity with each other as well as with far <dig> sequences of mammals . the sequence identity between ggfar <dig> and tafar <dig> was in the same range as that between the avian far <dig> proteins . on the other hand far <dig> of birds showed relatively low sequence identities with the avian far <dig> group and the mammalian far <dig> and far <dig> proteins . the avian sequences showed the lowest identity with far proteins of plants with at most 21%.

functional expression studies in yeast
to verify the catalytic properties of the avian sequences, functional expression studies in yeast were carried out. the data provided clear evidence that these sequences encoded fatty acyl-coa reductases that catalyzed the production of fatty alcohols . tafar <dig> showed the highest activity in yeast and produced up to  <dig> μmol fatty alcohol per gram fresh weight. the data in figure 2b also suggest, that the chain length specificity increased from adfar <dig>  via ggfar <dig> to tafar <dig>  while ggfar <dig> had a more pronounced substrate specificity than tafar <dig> 

feeding experiments with mixtures of fatty acids added to the media were carried out to investigate the alcohol production of intact transgenic yeast cells. supplementing the transgenic yeast strains with even-numbered, saturated fatty acids between  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms gave results very similar to those shown in figure 2b. only far <dig> cells contained slightly higher amounts of 14:0-oh, while far <dig> cells contained distinctly lower amounts of 18:1-oh and trace amounts of 20:0-oh. feeding experiments with monounsaturated fatty acids of chain lengths between  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms resulted in no additionally formed fatty alcohol species unlike those with odd-numbered, saturated fatty acids between  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms. as given in figure  <dig>  feeding experiments with odd-numbered fatty acids gave a fatty alcohol production within the yeast cells, distinctly different to the respective yeast cells without supplemented fatty acids . yeast cells expressing far <dig> enzymes of barn owl, chicken and goose produced 15:0-oh as main product that comprised up to 65% of the total mixture. furthermore 17:0-oh was detected in all of these yeast cells, although in lower amounts than 15:0-oh and 16:0-oh . on the other hand, yeast strains expressing far <dig> sequences produced mostly 18:0-oh and 17:0-oh while 19:0-oh was formed in low amounts only.

investigation of enzymatic properties
in line with the predicted transmembrane domain in the c-terminal region of the avian far proteins, assays with subcellular fractions of transgenic yeast cells expressing an avian far sequence showed that the far activity was detectable in the total membrane fraction only. all far enzymes required nadph as electron donor  as well as activated acyl groups as substrates . furthermore it was shown that both isoforms produced not only fatty alcohols but also fatty aldehydes as intermediates although in different proportions . far <dig> enzymes produced distinctly higher aldehyde levels than far <dig> enzymes. in addition, aldehyde production varied with the chain length of the acyl-coa and was highest in far <dig> assays with 14:0-coa . these data suggest that the aldehydes are prematurely released intermediates of the far reaction. the enzymatic activities were constant for up to  <dig> min at 37°c. the ph-optimum of far <dig> was found to be at  <dig>  while far <dig> displayed the highest activity at about ph  <dig>  . addition of up to  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> stimulated the far activity 2-fold, while addition of bsa into assays with  <dig> μm acyl-coa gave severalfold higher far activities . the alcohol formation rate was constant up to  <dig> μg protein of membrane fraction with far <dig> and up to  <dig> μg protein with far <dig> . under optimal conditions membranes harboring tafar <dig> showed a specific activity of about  <dig> nmol product*min-1*mg- <dig> protein whereas tafar <dig> showed a lower activity of about  <dig> nmol product*min-1*mg- <dig> protein.

studies with different acyl-coa concentrations were carried out to determine the substrate dependencies of far <dig> and far <dig> enzymes. as depicted in figure  <dig>  tafar <dig> was highly active with 16:0-coa and showed lower activity with 14:0-coa or 18:0-coa. on the other hand, tafar <dig> was distinctly more active with 18:0-coa than with 14:0-coa and 16:0-coa. the different chain length specificities of tafar <dig> and tafar <dig> were in line with results of the in vivo expression studies . they were also supported by competition assays conducted with membrane fractions harboring tafar <dig> or tafar <dig> and a mixture of unlabeled saturated acyl-coas with chain lengths of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms. tafar <dig> mostly produced 16:0-oh with about 80% of the total alcohol production and lower levels of 14:0-oh and 18:0-oh, whereas tafar <dig> synthesized about 60% of 18:0-oh, 25% of 20:0-oh and smaller amounts of 16:0-oh. both isozymes were inactive with 12:0-coa .

to investigate the ability of avian far enzymes to form branched-chain fatty alcohols that were detected in the uropygial wax esters of barn owl  <cit> , assays with  <dig> , <dig> -tetramethyl-c16-coa  and 2-methyl-branched acyl-coas, with chain lengths of  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms, were carried out with membrane fractions harboring avian far enzymes. as figure  <dig> displays, ggfar <dig> and tafar <dig> were active with 2-methyl-c16-coa whereas adfar <dig> as well as the far <dig> enzymes exhibited low activities with 2-methyl-c18-coa, compared to the empty vector control. in total, these activities were distinctly lower than those with saturated straight-chain acyl-coas and aldehyde synthesis could not be observed. no reductase activity was detected with phytanoyl-coa.

expression of ggfar <dig> and ggfar <dig> in different tissues of chicken
to investigate whether the expression of avian far sequences was restricted to the uropygial gland, the expression patterns of far <dig> and far <dig> were analyzed in the tissues of pectoral muscles, liver, uropygial gland, brain, adipose tissue and heart from domestic chicken by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. as depicted in figure  <dig>  far transcripts were detectable in various tissues, but far <dig> showed an expression pattern clearly different from that of far <dig>  expression of far <dig> was mainly demonstrated in the tissue of uropygial gland, while the highest expression of far <dig> was found in brain tissue.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we report on the functional characterization of fatty acyl-coa reductases from birds. based on the sequence similarity between far proteins, the respective cdnas from chicken, barn owl and goose were cloned. sequence similarities between the avian enzymes in conjunction with their expression pattern and their enzymatic properties suggest that they represent two different groups, termed far <dig> and far <dig>  while far <dig> enzymes preferred chain lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms, far <dig> enzymes showed a pronounced preference for c <dig> acyl groups. in that way avian far <dig> enzymes resemble the corresponding mammalian isozymes, while far <dig> enzymes of birds have acyl-coa specificities different from those of mammalian far enzymes  <cit> . within the avian far <dig> group only the enzyme of goose was found to have a relaxed chain length specificity. it displayed very similar activities with c <dig> to c <dig> acyl groups and thus combined the properties of both far <dig> and far <dig> of chicken and owl. perhaps geese express a far <dig> gene only in their uropygial glands. that would explain why we succeeded in cloning of far <dig> but not of far <dig> transcripts from this gland tissue. expression studies with goose tissues will show whether this assumption holds true.

far assays with 2-methyl-branched acyl-coa thioesters gave activity patterns with the different isozymes  similar to those obtained with respective unbranched acyl-coas . again the far <dig> enzymes of both chicken and barn owl were most active with the c <dig> acyl group while the far <dig> enzymes specifically used the c <dig> acyl group. regardless of the bird species, specific activities of the far enzymes were about fifty times lower with branched than with unbranched acyl-coa thioesters. these data suggest that avian far can produce branched-chain fatty alcohols only if the enzymes are provided with an acyl-coa pool largely consisting of branched-chain acyl groups. in view of the very similar properties of far enzymes from chicken and barn owl this appears to hold true regardless of whether uropygial glands produce wax ester with branched-chain alcohols, like those of barn owl, or without such alcohols, like chicken and goose  <cit> . uropygial glands have been shown to control their synthesis of multi-branched fatty acids by the substrate pool available to fatty acid synthetase  <cit> . while malonyl-coa caused the formation of n-fatty acid, substitution of malonyl-coa by methylmalonyl-coa resulted in an efficient synthesis of multi-methyl-branched fatty acid in spite of the fact that the fatty acid synthetase has about  <dig> times higher activity with malonyl-coa than with methylmalonyl-coa in vitro  <cit> . according to these data it is likely that uropygial glands regulate not only fatty acid synthesis but also acyl-coa reduction by the substrate pool available to the respective enzymes. however, additional regulation mechanisms might be involved as well. perhaps acyl-coa synthetases, specifically expressed in the uropygial glands of barn owl and preferentially activating branched-chain fatty acids, can facilitate substrate channeling, but this awaits clarification. currently we cannot exclude the possibility that birds which secrete wax with branched-chain fatty alcohols possess uropygial gland-specific far enzymes unrelated to the known ones but in view of the data so far available this appears unlikely.

expression studies of far sequences in chicken demonstrated that these enzymes are distributed to different tissues. ggfar <dig> showed the highest expression level in the uropygial gland whereas ggfar <dig> was highly expressed in the brain tissue, suggesting that avian enzymes may be involved in wax ester and ether lipid biosynthesis and perhaps in pheromone production  <cit> . enzymes of the far family from other taxa can be distributed to numerous tissues as well and are not restricted to one biosynthetic pathway  <cit> .

the characterized enzymes show chain length specificities for middle- to long-chain acyl-coas, regardless of whether these substrates are branched or unbranched. because alcohols with chain lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> carbon atoms are manufactured for a multiplicity of applications  <cit> , the characterized avian far might be used as enzymatic catalysts for the production of such oleochemicals. engineering of oil crops expressing far in combination with corresponding fatty acid synthesizing and activating enzymes could be a prospective approach to reduce the dependency upon fossil oil to produce fatty alcohols. expression of enzymes involved in the fatty alcohol biosynthetic pathway in combination with wax ester synthases could be a further possibility to design new oil crops for industry.
