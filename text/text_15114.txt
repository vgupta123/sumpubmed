BACKGROUND
in recent years, the advent of high-throughput analytical techniques, such as microarrays and serial analysis of gene expression , has led to a rapid accumulation of biological data. the large size of databases, which are now within the petabytes range  <cit>  precludes manual analysis and renders unsystematic approaches obsolete. to cope with these new challenges and to facilitate efficient data analyses, numerous academic and commercial software packages and databases have been developed  <cit> . yet, genes to which no biological function has been assigned compromise the usability of these data. in particular, the construction of linear and non-linear models has proven to be difficult if "function unknown genes" are included  <cit> . any attempts to integrate and analyze complex biological data from various "omics" techniques  to understand biological phenomena as a collection of interconnected systems will depend on the functional annotation of the majority of their components  <cit> . thus, successful approaches to "systems biology" will depend on the identification and functional characterization of most if not all players in the system under study  <cit> . an obvious, almost trivial conclusion is the systematic identification of only those genes, which lack biologically valid annotations, followed by functional characterization. surprisingly, only few attempts were made to address this problem systematically although most databases contain large numbers of genes, which have only been identified by computational sequence analyses  <cit> . instead, most efforts have concentrated on large-scale functional analyses such a proteome-wide protein interaction screens  <cit>  or genome-wide sirna knockdowns  <cit> , which are much more difficult to perform and are notoriously unreliable  <cit> . other approaches such as chip-on-chip  <cit>  and chip-seq  <cit>  are limited to specific biological properties .

the relevance of this problem becomes apparent in experiments that use large datasets such as in dna microarray hybridizations. transcriptional profiling of a diseased heart, for example, will identify changes in the expression of known signaling pathways as well as genes, which do not fit into existing regulatory circuits . although the expression profile of the latter group of genes might correlate strongly with certain physiological conditions or developmental status suggesting potential interactions with known regulatory networks, reliable data to describe the biological function are most often missing.

here, we describe a strategy for the systematic identification of genes, which are correlated with a specific biological condition  but lack functional characterization. our approach is based on the systematic exploitation of existing databases such as the unigene database  <cit> , which contain information about organ-specific expression patterns, applying a number of different filters. information gathered from expression databases were matched with publication records based on the assumption that virtually all genes with a functional characterization will also relay to a corresponding publication. although the focus of the study was on "heart-enriched genes", our approach is applicable to virtually all organs and physiological status. the expression profiles of identified gene were validated by rt-pcr using different murine adult organs and by whole-mount in situ  hybridization of mouse embryos. the functional role of selected genes was also approached by morpholino knock-down experiments in zebrafish embryos

RESULTS
in silico screening of unigene database
several public databases for "omics" data are available, which cover the expression profile of individual genes in various organisms to a different extent. for our study, we employed the unigene database, which contains comprehensive coverage of various organisms and a collection of expression data. each unigene id has an attached "expression profile", which can be used to search for specific expression sites. to identify genes in a systematic manner, which show a preferential expression in the heart but lack a proper functional annotation, we selected  <dig> different organisms for our analysis  . applying the rule "select genes whose rank for 'heart' is under the top 20% across homologues" resulted in the identification of  <dig>  mouse genes, which fitted the rule in more than one organism. it should be pointed out that the combination of expression data from different organisms reduced the number of false-positive candidates. since the expression profile of genes is normally conserved among evolutionary close species, any expression profile that is unique for a single species is likely to indicate faulty expression profiling rather than a biological meaningful result.

after identification of heart-enriched genes, we searched for genes in this group, which lack a proper annotation. we assumed that genes with no or very few publications are "uncharacterized genes". to avoid papers describing large screening efforts , which usually do not include a functional analysis, we excluded papers that contained more than  <dig> geneids . obviously, this selection is rather strict resulting in exclusion of potentially interesting genes. to address this problem, we added another selection criterion that was based on medical subject headings . inclusion of the mesh term for "heart" with less than  <dig> publications resulted in the identification of  <dig>  "uncharacterized" mouse genes, which show an expression in the heart. figure  <dig> depicts the numbers of heart-enriched genes, which were identified using different combinations of organisms. selection of genes based on the concurrent expression in the heart in all model organisms massively decreased the number of positive genes yielding  <dig> heart-enriched genes of which  <dig> are uncharacterized. unfortunately, the quality of the expression data is not identical in all model organisms, which resulted in exclusion of genes, which have not been properly accessed but in fact are expressed in the heart. an improvement of the quality of the expression data will reduce the number of false-negative genes in the future.

validation of the in silico screening
to demonstrate the efficiency of our method, we searched the gene ontology project  <cit>  for the term "heart" and matched the results with our data set that was based on the analysis of the expression data including genes, which lack an annotation. we used  <dig> go terms that contain the phrase "heart" and screened the gene names and symbols of the  <dig> selected model organisms. we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> go terms contained at least one gene in the organisms studied. the number of genes that were obtained through our method and the coverage of go terms in percentages of the genes that matched our selection criteria are shown in additional file  <dig>  for example, about 30% of the genes that carry the go term "heart development " were covered by our method . the information about all  <dig> mouse genes that were extracted through our method using the go term "heart development" is listed in additional file  <dig> 

further selection rules to eliminate ubiquitously expressed genes
to validate the data obtained by our selection rules and to confirm the database records, rt-pcr experiments using mouse adult organs were performed. surprisingly, we found that a large number of genes were expressed in multiple organs . we therefore devised a set of additional rules to exclude ubiquitously expressed genes:  genes must be expressed in less than 50% of total tissues;  sum of gene est must be less than 400; and  at least 25% of gene est must be expressed in the target tissue . application of these rules efficiently eliminated ubiquitously expressed genes and left genes that were expressed preferentially in the heart . interestingly, most of the genes that remained after this selection were also expressed in striated muscles. this result was not unexpected given the fact that skeletal muscles and the heart are both composed of striated muscle cells, which share numerous morphological and physiological properties. table  <dig> lists the number of mouse genes that were identified by using the combination of our selection rules. inclusion of all three additional selection rules left only  <dig> mouse genes while inclusion of selection rules  and  left  <dig> genes. as shown in figure 4b, inclusion of selection rules  and  did already efficiently exclude ubiquitously expressed genes. addition of the third selection rule did not improve massively the number of genes with a heart-enriched expression pattern but result in a general decrease of selected genes. the inclusion of the third selection criterion proved to be helpful only for some cases .

the total numbers of genes that were identified using various combinations of selection tools are listed.

identification of developmentally expressed genes
the expression in the adult heart does not necessarily mean that the corresponding gene is also expressed during early heart development. we therefore chose  <dig> genes from the genes that emerged from the computational screening and subjected them to whole-mount in situ hybridization  using e <dig>  and e <dig>  mouse embryos. at this stage, most organs have either formed or undergo organogenesis.  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes showed expression in the heart while  <dig> genes failed to display a specific expression at these stages . based on the expression pattern, we distinguished two different groups: group  <dig> showed equally strong expression in the heart both at e <dig>  and e <dig>  ; and group  <dig> showed an increase of expression at e <dig>  compared to e <dig>  .

preliminary functional characterization of selected genes by loss-of-function in zebrafish embryos
to obtain initial functional data for the selected genes, we turned to a loss-of-function analysis. two uncharacterized, heart-enriched genes were chosen: leucine rich repeat containing  <dig>  and kelch-like  <dig>  . lrrc <dig> is highly expressed in the adult heart based on the rt-pcr analysis, and also found in eyes, skeletal muscle, brown fat, and weakly in the stomach . during development, lrrc <dig> is expressed at e <dig>  in the heart, in somites and in the eye anlagen . klhl <dig> showed a slightly different expression pattern. it was expressed in the adult heart, brown fat, skeletal muscle, and testes . klhl <dig> was also detected very strongly in the heart during development at e <dig>  by wish .

we decided to accomplish the loss-of-function analysis in zebrafish embryos because knock-down of genes is relatively easily achieved in zebrafish by injection of antisense morpholinos. in addition, the development of the cardiovascular system in zebrafish embryos can be conveniently monitored by microscopical inspections. the zebrafish homologues of lrrc <dig> and klhl <dig> were identified using homologene  <cit>  yielding "zgc:112088" and "klhl31" . morpholinos against "zlrrc39" and "zklhl31" were directed at their atg sites.

zlrrc <dig> morphants showed the first signs of disturbed development at  <dig> hour post fertilization . at  <dig> hpf, zlrrc <dig> morphants displayed a considerable pericardial edema, which is a characteristic sign of cardiac malfunctions . all morphants died within  <dig> hours after this time point. to facilitate detection of developmental defects in the heart, we employed a transgenic zebrafish line "tgs883"  <cit> , in which myocardial cells were labeled by gfp. macroscopical evaluation of injected and control embryos at  <dig> hpf followed by sectioning revealed a disturbed arrangement of cardiomyocytes in the hearts of zlrrc <dig> morphants, but not in control embryos, indicating a role of zlrrc <dig> in morphogenetic processes controlling heart development . in addition, zlrrc <dig> morphants were characterized by small eyes, malformations of the lower jaw, and distorted muscle structures . it was interesting to note that the affected organs reflected the expression profile of zlrrc <dig> during mouse development.

the knock-down of zklhl <dig> resulted in a more severe phenotype compared to zlrrc <dig> essentially abrogating development at  <dig> hpf. at  <dig> hpf, zklhl <dig> morphants showed cardiac and yolk sac edema as well as a distorted body axis . sectioning of the heart of zklhl <dig> morphants revealed that ventricle morphogenesis was severely disturbed, which essentially prevented looping of the heart.

discussion
in the current study, we have devised a new strategy to identify and characterize organ-specific gene, which lack a detailed functional annotation. we reason that the identification and characterization of such genes will facilitate future attempts to understand biological phenomena as a collection of interconnected systems. our approach was based on a systematic exploitation of various databases such as unigene. unigene is a ncbi's database system for automatically partitioning genbank sequences, including ests, into a non-redundant set of gene-oriented clusters  <cit> . each unigene cluster contains sequences that represent a unique gene or expressed pseudogene, together with related data sets including information about tissue types in which the gene is expressed, model organism protein similarities, and genomic locations. as of may  <dig>   <dig> species and thousands of sequence libraries from various tissues were used to build unigene clusters. in principle, unigene contains comprehensive expression profiles based on sequencing results, which can be used to obtain information about expression patterns for a particular gene. unigene also provides a category called "restricted expression". in order for a unigene gene cluster to fall under this category, more than half of the genbank sequences assigned to the cluster must come from the same source tissue. in mus musculus, there are only  <dig> gene clusters  listed under "restricted expression" in "heart", which limits this application to genes that are not expressed in any other tissue and restricts the usefulness of this tool.

to overcome the loss-of-information, which occurs when applying such strict criteria, we developed selection rules that are based on the conservation of expression profiles of homologous genes between different species. this strategy successfully enlarged the number of detected genes without compromising the specificity of the detection.

many studies have been conducted to identify tissue/organ-specific genes with known and unknown functions : endothelial  <cit> ; epidiymis  <cit> ; heart  <cit> ; mammary gland  <cit> ; pancreas  <cit> ; preimplantation stages  <cit> ; prostate  <cit> ; skeletal muscle  <cit> ; and testis  <cit> . other studies focused on the discovery of biomarkers for diseases such as colon  <cit>  and prostate cancer  <cit> . most of these studies utilized cdna or est sequences and libraries from dbest  <cit>  or unigene to screen for tissue/organ-specific genes. some of these studies were validated by additional computational methods while others used rt-pcr or northern blotting experiments to confirm the initial database searches. only two studies included functional data  <cit> . in contrast to previous studies, which restricted the analysis to one or two species, we included four different organisms to identify species-conserved, heart-enriched expression patterns.

several databases such as dbest or unigene  <cit>  provide knowledge about tissue/organ-specific genes and give information about expression in different organisms  <cit>  but are not particularly useful to serve as a starting point for further functional studies of uncharacterized genes. our approach is simple and intuitive and does not require extensive programming and computational knowledge. we have demonstrated that dgsa  provides an efficient means to select hitherto uncharacterized genes for further functional analysis. since our selection criteria strongly relied on the conservation of expression profiles among species, it was straightforward to turn to a functional analysis of identified genes using non-amniotes model organisms such as zebrafish, which are particularly suited for rapid functional characterization using morpholino injections to achieve a loss-of-function phenotype. selected genes might also be linked easily to databases of non-amniotes model organisms such as the zebrafish model organisms database   <cit> . as of april  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> zebrafish homologs of heart-enriched genes were included in this database . of these,  <dig>  were linked to phenotypes in heart or cardiac-related structures . further efforts to characterize mutants of genes, which were identified by dgsa in amniotes, will certainly increase this coverage in the future.

one might argue that a selection for conserved expression patterns might artificially restrict the number of genes, which can be detected or lead to the identification of genes that are not involved in the development, maintenance, or remodeling of the heart. to address this potential criticism, we matched the genes, which were identified by our selection criteria with go terms for known heart-enriched genes. the fact that our algorithm provided 30% or more coverage for genes that are known to be involved in "heart development " clearly indicates that our selection rules work efficiently even without performing additional biological experiments. although the current study focused on heart-enriched genes, we reasoned that our selection rules might be easily extended to other organs, such as brain, liver, spleen, and testis. in fact, we found that application of our selection rules to the above mentioned organs yielded the same coverage of go terms as for the heart .

CONCLUSIONS
we have introduced an efficient way to screen for "heart-enriched" genes with unknown functions. the computational approach to screen for genes across  <dig> species is simple and intuitive and might be applied by experimental biologists without programming knowledge. the presented strategy can be easily extended by implementing expression information about developing embryos obtained through public microarray and sage databases. further functional analysis of identified genes will help to fill the gaps in our knowledge, which prevents a comprehensive understanding of complex molecular interactions as intended by "systems biology" researchers.
