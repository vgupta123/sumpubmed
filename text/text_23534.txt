BACKGROUND
adam <dig> is a widely expressed member of the adam  gene family encoding transmembrane metalloproteinase-disintegrins  <cit> . the characteristic domain structure of adam proteins consists of n-terminal signal sequence and prodomain, which typically are proteolytically excised during biosynthetic maturation, followed by metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytosolic tail. despite the presence of the conserved metalloproteinase domain, not all adams are active proteinases; roughly half of the over  <dig> adam members do not contain all catalytically critical residues. human adam <dig> is an active metalloproteinase and can bind to several integrins  <cit> .

adams have been implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes through their proteolytic or adhesive activities, including ectodomain shedding and cell-cell interactions  <cit> . adam <dig> has been implicated in activation of growth factors through ectodomain shedding and in cell-cell interactions, but specific physiological roles are not known. adam <dig> gene knockout in mice did not result in obvious developmental or pathological phenotype  <cit> . however, strongly decreased angiogenesis in the retinopathy of prematurity model in adam15-/- mice indicated a critical role in pathological neovascularization  <cit> , corroborated by the studies implicating adam <dig> in regulation of vasculogenesis  <cit> .

altered adam <dig> expression has been associated with human diseases, including cancers, cardiac disease, atherosclerosis, and arthritis  <cit> . in cancers, adam <dig> has been implicated in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis  <cit> . in addition to the transcriptional regulation of adam <dig> expression, alternative splicing of adam <dig> transcripts has been shown to be mis-regulated in human cancer cells  <cit> . although adam <dig> splice-variants have been found from mouse and human cell lines  <cit> , no information has been available about the alternative adam <dig> splicing in normal tissues.

to gain better understanding of adam <dig> regulation, the present study provides a detailed structural and functional characterization of human adam <dig> gene as well as its expression and alternative exon use in normal human tissues.

RESULTS
human adam <dig> gene structure
pac-clone 240c <dig> containing the human adam <dig> gene was previously identified and shown to hybridize with a single chromosomal locus at 1q <dig>   <cit> . sequencing verified that 240c <dig> includes the entire adam <dig> gene . the annotated gene sequence was submitted to genbank .

adam <dig> gene is flanked by the flj32785/dcst <dig> and ephrin-a <dig>  genes. flj <dig>  polyadenylation signal is located  <dig> bp upstream from adam <dig> translation start codon, and ephrin-a <dig>  translation start  <dig> bp downstream from adam <dig> polyadenylation signal. in this report, if not mentioned otherwise, the nucleotide numbering is relative to the adenine of the adam <dig> translation start codon.

human adam <dig> gene spans  <dig> bp from the translation start to the polyadenylation signal, contains  <dig> exons varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and  <dig> introns varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. . adam <dig> is the shortest multiple-exon adam gene . the exons 19â€“ <dig> are used alternatively in human tissues .

all adam <dig> introns conform the gt-ag splicing rule . while the adam <dig> introns in general contain good putative branch sites, the branch sites in the introns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> scored lower than average branch sites in the human genome. although the branch-site anlyzer failed to predict the branch site for intron  <dig>  a good consensus sequence was found at appropriate location. the putative branch site sequences are shown in additional file  <dig> 

the intron/exon structure of the human, mouse, and rat adam <dig> genes is almost identical. the human exon  <dig>  the mouse exon  <dig>  and the rat exon  <dig> show an internal  <dig> bp deletion respective to the others. another difference is that the 3'-splice site  of the human intron  <dig> is located three nucleotides downstream from that of the rodent genes, causing the human exon  <dig> to be  <dig> bp shorter. the ag corresponding to the 3'ss of the rodent intron  <dig> is also present in the human sequence  and hence the human intron  <dig> acceptor contains a tagtag-sequence constituting a candidate nagnag tandem acceptor  <cit>  which could enable  <dig> bp variation at the exon start. use of the proximal acceptor would lead to an inframe stop codon  at the exon  <dig> start. however, transcripts with the exon  <dig> stop form have not been detected.

the exons  <dig> and  <dig> have alternative 5'- or 3'-ends, respectively . the exon  <dig> forms, the shorter referred as 20a and the longer as 20b, are a consequence of a nagnag tandem acceptor . the alternative exon  <dig> forms share the 5' splice site  and the longer referred as 21b has a 3' splice site   <dig> bp further downstream from that of 21a .

the adam <dig> gene contains four separate cpg-islands. the longest cpg-island extends from the last flj <dig> intron to the first adam <dig> intron . two shorter islands are located within adam <dig> intron  <dig>  and the fourth island encompass region from adam <dig> exon  <dig> past the polyadenylation site .

human adam <dig> gene contains several transcription start sites and a tataless promoter
evidence for several transcription start sites
5'race experiments indicated the presence of several 5'-ends upstream of adam <dig> exon  <dig>  differing in length and sequence . however, an impractical number of 5'race products would have had to be cloned and sequenced for unambiguous results, due to alternative sequence in similar-sized 5'-ends. for the same reason, primer extension from exon  <dig> would have produced equivocal results. therefore the pcr approach described in the methods was used to analyse the 5' end of adam <dig> transcripts.

the gradual decrease of product levels in consecutive pcrs of 5'-utr indicated that human adam <dig> transcription starts at several sites at different levels . while most adam <dig> transcriptions started at around  <dig> bp upstream from the translation start, transcripts starting from up to - <dig> bp were detected with  <dig> pcr cycles .

the 5'race results also indicated fusion transcription, joining the upstream-neighbour flj <dig> and adam <dig>  this was confirmed using the pcr approach. transcripts were amplified with a common downstream primer at adam <dig> exon  <dig> and various upstream primers at flj <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig>  this indicated that fusion transcripts start at least within flj <dig> exon  <dig>  possibly containing flj <dig> fused to adam <dig>  however, the fusion transcripts were detected only after  <dig> pcr cycles, indicating their scarcity in the studied cells . 5'race product and genbank est sequences indicate that both gts flanking the flj <dig> polyadenylation signal were used as donors in splicing to adam <dig> exon  <dig> .

the upstream primers at the flj <dig> intron  <dig> failed to amplify pcr-products, suggesting that the intron  <dig> is excluded normally from fusion transcripts. adam <dig> transcripts with flj <dig> intron  <dig> sequence at 5' end were not detected, indicating that no alternative adam <dig> transcription start sites are present in the flj <dig> intron  <dig>  hence, the transcripts encoding adam <dig> protein start at - <dig> through - <dig> region. given this and the location within a cpg island, this region was examined for promoter activity.

adam <dig> promoter induced expression in luciferase reporter assay
reporter expression analysis confirmed that the candidate promoter region contained a functional promoter. the region - <dig> through - <dig> increased the reporter activity to  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold in sk-br- <dig> and hcc- <dig> cells, respectively, as compared to the control sv40-promoter .

deletion of the nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig> resulted in the reduction of the promoter activity to a third of the original . this weakened mutant promoter lacked five of the six sp <dig> recognition motifs and the pax- <dig> site, containing only an en- <dig>  a hoxa <dig>  and a composite sp1/myod recognition motif .

the upstream segment - <dig> to - <dig> showed a weak repressive effect, since its addition to the - <dig> through - <dig> construct reduced the promoter activity . however, the corresponding sequence is largely absent from the mouse and rat adam <dig> genes , and the only high score vertebrate transcription factor  binding motif within this region is for hoxa <dig> . while the reporter construct extension to the base pair  <dig> did not alter the reduced promoting efficiency, the further extension to  <dig> restored the reported expression to the original level . this suggests positive regulatory activity for the region  <dig> to  <dig>  extension of the reporter construct beyond  <dig> did not significantly affect the promoter activity. the effect of the flj <dig> intron  <dig> to adam <dig> promoter activity was minimal at most, consistent with the lack of conservation in the region. altogether, the most critical adam <dig> transcription-supporting elements are located within the region  <dig> to  <dig> 

transcription factor binding motifs in the core promoter
the several transcription start sites  <dig> to  <dig> bp upstream from adam <dig> translation start indicated the location of a core promoter . the presence of several conserved tf recognition motifs in the region is consistent with the transcription start sites corroborating the core promoter location. the promoter region showed some conservation in automated sequence alignment . however, manual optimization increased the conservation significantly .

the high-score vertebrate tf binding motifs found in human adam <dig> promoter sequence and in the corresponding mouse and rat sequences are shown in figure  <dig>  the putative adam <dig> promoter lacks the tata and caat boxes also in rodents, and contains conserved binding sequences for five sp1/gc-box recognition sites in all three species. in addition, the human sequence contains a sixth sp <dig> motif, a pax- <dig> motif, and a composite sp1/myod element. the human and rat genes contain a binding sequence for engrailed  <dig>  at a separate but close location upstream of the sp1/gc boxes. the nearby upstream region contains also a hoxa <dig> binding sequence in human and an aml- <dig> and c/ebp binding sequences in mouse .

potential regulatory regions outside the core promoter
the human, mouse, and rat adam <dig> genes were subjected to phylogenetic footprinting in order to localize potential cis-regulatory elements outside the core promoter. sequence conservation analysis  was complemented with a search for clusters of conserved tf recognition motifs, which would indicate locations of potential extra-core promoter regulatory elements .

in all three species, the flj <dig> intron  <dig> consists mostly of repetitive sequence with only short conserved elements lacking tf binding motif clusters in between . consistently, reporter experiments showed that flj <dig> intron  <dig> does not contain strong adam <dig> promoter activity-regulating elements.

the most prominent conserved non-coding adam <dig> regions were found in introns  <dig> and  <dig>  intron  <dig> region  <dig> to  <dig> and intron  <dig> region  <dig> to  <dig> are conserved across all three species and contain several conserved tf recognition motifs which are more tightly clustered in the intron  <dig> region . the conserved regions do not contain long open reading frames nor were corresponding transcribed sequences found from the genbank, suggesting that the intronic conservation is not due to transcription of another gene.

also the introns flanking the alternatively used exons contain obvious conserved regions. the low number of match- and consite-predicted tf binding sites suggests other potential role for these sequences from transcription regulation of adam <dig> or the downstream efna <dig>  these regions might be conserved due their possible role in adam <dig> splicing or in the regulation of alternative splicing. conservation in the introns flanking alternatively used exons has been reported also for other genes  <cit> .

the human and mouse introns  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contain repetitive elements at corresponding locations, but only four of these  <dig> elements show conservation also in the type and sequence . sine or mir repetitive elements were not detected in the introns with long conserved regions or introns containing cpg-islands, as if their insertion would not have been tolerated.

three adam <dig> exons are used differentially in human tissues
in addition to the previously reported human adam <dig> transcripts, nine novel mrna variants were identified after the cloning and sequencing of over  <dig> reverse transcription-pcr  products. the variants result from alternative use of the exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . two of these exons are alternatively spliced at one end, giving rise to the exon variants 20a/20b and 21a/21b . the exons 1â€“ <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found in all examined adam <dig> transcripts, indicating that they are constitutively used. the variant  <dig>  was not confirmed by sequencing but was indicated by the consistent appearance of the predicted size fluorescence pcr  product and by rt-pcr amplification with a primer specific for the exon-exon junction 18/ <dig> . the sequences were submitted to genbank .

adam <dig> mrna variant profile in human tissues
tissue distribution of adam <dig> mrna variants was examined with fpcr of a cdna panel representing  <dig> human tissues. tissues showed distinctive adam <dig> variant patterns with  <dig> to  <dig> different variants at various levels . the average relative adam <dig> variant levels varied from less than 1%  to 59% of the variant  <dig> . placenta showed the simplest and spleen and peripheral leukocytes the most complex adam <dig> variant profiles .

the exon 20a/20b usage ratio in human tissues, calculated from variants 6a/b, was on average  <dig>  varying from  <dig>  in skeletal muscle to  <dig>  in spleen. this indicated non-constant ratio use for acceptors and that neither of the acceptor sites in the intron  <dig> nagnag was exclusively used in any examined tissue.

the adam <dig> mrna levels in human tissues were investigated using two methods: by summing-up the mrna variant levels determined in fpcr experiments and by the real-time quantitative pcr  amplification of a fragment within the constantly expressed ectodomain-coding region. the tissue expression results paralleled each other , corroborating the reliability of the adam <dig> mrna variant profiling assay and indicating that the amplified fpcr fragments are parts of full-length adam <dig> transcripts. this also suggests that, in addition to the comparability of individual adam <dig> variant levels within given tissue, the variant levels could be comparable also between different tissues. an exception to this is the testicular expression for which no reliable housekeeping marker gene was available for normalization  <cit> .

alternative splice-regulatory elements in the adam <dig> gene
conservation of the alternative use of the adam <dig> exons  <dig> to  <dig> in man and mouse motivated the comparative examination of the human, mouse, and rat adam <dig> gene sequences for the identification of the sequence elements associated with the regulation of alternative splicing.

splice and branch sites in the alternative introns
roughly half of the information for splicing has been estimated to reside in splice and branch site sequences  <cit> . the 5'ss sequences in the introns  <dig> ,  <dig> , and 21a  deviate from the consensus donor sequence  at +4/+ <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig> positions, respectively. also, the calculated binding energies of u <dig> snrna base-pairing with these 5'ss  are weaker than in average human 5'ss . however, all the 5'ss-scores in the introns flanking the alternative exons are in normal range . intron  <dig> 3'ss  asd-workbench score  and intron  <dig> branch site score  are low while the other 3'ss scores  and branch/pyrimidine tract scores  in the alternatively used introns are normal.

the second half of the information for splicing regulation is located outside of the splice and branch sites, in the exon and intron sequences. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of the potential splice-regulatory factor target motifs in the alternatively spliced region of human adam <dig> gene.

exonic splice enhancer and silencer  sequences in alternatively used adam <dig> exons
constitutive human exons typically contain three to seven rescue-ese clusters   <cit> . the alternatively used human adam <dig> exons  <dig>  20a/b and 21a contain one/zero, one/zero, and three/six eses/putative exonic splice enhancers  found with the rescue-ese  <cit> /pesx  <cit>  predictions, respectively. all eses and peses in exon 21a are in two clusters . the number of ese-finder-predicted sr-protein binding motifs in the alternative adam <dig> exons is one third lower than the average in the constitutive adam <dig> exons . furthermore, only three sr-protein binding motifs were localized to alternative exons . hence, the alternative adam <dig> exon splicing might be less enhanced by eses than the constitutive exons.

the alternative adam <dig> exons  <dig>  20a/b, and 21a lack esss/pesss and binding motifs for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins  altogether and contain lower than average number of exonic splice-regulatory sequences . while  <dig>  esrs were localized to adam <dig> exons on average, the alternatively used exons  <dig>  20a/b, and 21a contain seven, eight, and two esrs, respectively. despite the low usage in adam <dig> transcripts, the unique 3' part of the exon 21b contains several ese, pese, ess, and esr motifs as well as sr-protein and hnrnp binding motifs .

ese and ess sequences in two cryptic adam <dig> exons
the genbank est sequences indicate locations for two rarely used cryptic exons within introns  <dig> and  <dig>  referred to as ec- <dig> and ec- <dig>  . both cryptic exons contain several exonic splicing enhancer and silencer motifs . transcripts containing these exons were not detected with exon specific primers in rt-pcr or fpcr, suggesting that they are not functional exons.

esss, eses, hnrnp and sr-protein target motifs, and introninc splice enhancers  in the alternative adam <dig> introns
in contrast to the alternative exons, the introns flanking them were rich in eses and esss as well as in hnrnp and sr-protein binding motifs . the intron  <dig> contains several hnrnp h/f binding motifs and the intron  <dig> especially many conserved srp <dig>  srp30b, srp <dig>  hnrnp f/h, and hnrnp b/d/e binding motifs. conserved hnrnp h/f binding motifs are present near the intron 21a ends. furthermore, several g- and c-rich ises were scattered throughout the alternative introns. the number of the g- and c-rich ises parallel the high guanine and or cytosine content, respectively, in the introns 18â€“ <dig> 

alternative splice regulation-associated motifs in the alternatively spliced adam <dig> region
the four most significantly alternative splicing-associated upstream sequence motifs  predicted in brudno et al.  <cit>  were found in adam <dig> alternative introns . of the predicted motifs, gcaugc and ugcaug contain a recognition sequence  for fox-family alternative splicing regulator proteins  <cit> . the intron  <dig> contains an augcau and cugcua motifs close to the 3'- and 5'ss, respectively. 2/ <dig>  2/ <dig>  and 0/ <dig> gcaugc/ugcaug motifs are in central location in the introns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. in addition to the human adam <dig>  six of the eleven corresponding motifs are present also in at least either one of the rodents.

binding motifs for the neuronal splice-enhancer nova-1/ <dig> were located in the introns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . five out of nine nova-binding motifs were found in the corresponding location also in both rodents . the exon  <dig> contains one and the intron  <dig> three binding motifs for the celf/brunol family proteins. corresponding intronic motifs were found also from mouse and/or rat. muscleblind-like protein  <dig>  binding motifs were found in the exon  <dig> and in the introns  <dig> and  <dig>  the exonic mbnl <dig> binding sequence is conserved in human, rat and mouse. exon skipping-associated c-rich or g-rich motifs  <cit>  were located in the introns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the intron  <dig> g-rich motif is present also in both rodents and the first motif in the intron  <dig> is present also in mouse. altogether 62% of the alternative splicing associated elements in the human adam <dig> exon  <dig> to intron  <dig> region were found also at the corresponding positions in mouse or rat, 34% being present in all three species.

deduced cytosolic adam <dig> isoform tails contain different sets of potential sh3-interaction motifs
all characterized adam <dig> mrna variants encode common ectodomain and transmembrane parts, and vary only at their cytosolic-encoding region. variants encoding isoforms without the transmembrane part were not detected. depending on the presence of the first alternative exon  <dig>  adam <dig> mrna variants are translated along either of the two alternative reading frames in the cytosolic-encoding region, downstream of exon  <dig> .

the variants  <dig>  4a/b,  <dig>  6a/b, 7a/b, and  <dig> with exon  <dig>  are translated along the first reading frame after exon  <dig> . since the first reading frame is open and the lengths of the alternative exons 20a, 20b, or 21a  are divisible by three, their inclusion does not change the reading frame and their alternative use changes the adam <dig> cytosolic tail in modular fashion. therefore the deduced protein isoforms either contain or lack the segments encoded by these exons while the carboxyl end is invariable. the first reading frame contains an inframe stop codon in the exon 21b and thus the adam <dig> variants 7a/b and  <dig>  encode truncated tail isoforms . the variants with the exon  <dig>  translated along the first reading frame, contain up to seven pxxp-type src-homology- <dig> -binding motifs in five separate proline clusters in their cytosolic tails . the proline clusters are encoded by the exons  <dig>  20a/b, 21a and the 22/ <dig> junction .

the adam <dig> variants lacking the exon  <dig>  are translated along the second reading frame downstream of the exon  <dig>  along this frame, exons 20a/b  encode also a proline cluster with sh3-binding motif ; adam <dig> isoforms  containing this motif appear to show different sh <dig> protein interactions from those of isoforms translated along the first reading frame . the variants  <dig> and  <dig> do not encode known sh <dig> interaction motifs.

the adam <dig> variants 7a/b,  <dig>  and  <dig> are predisposed to nonsense mediated mrna decay  pathway since they contain an inframe stop codon further than  <dig> nt upstream of exon-exon junctions 21b- <dig> and/or 22â€“ <dig>  this suggests that proteins encoded by these adam <dig> variants would not likely be produced at high level, consistent with their low mrna levels . the variants  <dig>  3a, and 3b contain an inframe stop codon at exon  <dig> only  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction and are thus not likely to be targeted to nmd.

adam <dig> comprises a subgroup with adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 28
the adam <dig> exon-intron organization and protein sequence were compared to other human and mouse adams and nematode adam <dig>  based on genomic and protein sequence similarities, adams fell into  <dig> subfamilies. the adam exon-intron structures and a phylogenetic tree depicting the amino acid sequence similarities of the deduced adam proteins are shown in figure  <dig> 

the overall adam <dig> exon-intron structure is most similar to adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the intron/exon structure of the extracellular  and transmembrane encoding regions in adam <dig> is highly similar to that in  <dig> adam gene family members . in contrast to the ectodomain, the structure of cytosolic-encoding gene region varies greatly between different adams, and only five adams show intron phases and locations partially conserved with adam <dig> in cytosolic-encoding region. the adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> share  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> introns with conserved phase and location, respectively. also at the protein sequence level, adam <dig> is most similar to adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  adam <dig> shows similarity with adam <dig> at cytosolic tail sequence  as well as in the gene structure encoding it.

adam <dig> differs from other adam genes by three notable features. first, human and mouse adam <dig> lack an intron present in almost all other multiple-exon adam-genes . another difference is the absence of a part of the exon  <dig>  which encodes a conserved membrane-proximal adam-specific protein motif, present in the majority of adams from c. elegans to humans. this exon segment is absent also from adams - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  third, adam <dig> is the only adam, in addition to adam <dig>  <cit> , with conserved alternative splicing in cytosolic-encoding exons. in other adams alternative use of cytosolic-encoding exons is restricted to either mouse or man .

discussion
this report describes characterization of the human adam <dig> gene and promoter, comparative analysis of potential transcriptional and alternative splicing-regulatory elements in human and rodent adam <dig> genes, and the first demonstration of complex differential alternative adam <dig> splicing in human tissues.

adam <dig>  or its chromosomal neighborhood, appears to have been under selection pressure towards shorter length. adam <dig> gene is one third of the average human gene length  <cit>  and the shortest of multiple-exon adam genes . although the number of adam <dig> exons is two and half times the human average and the exons are of normal size, the average adam <dig> intron length is less than one tenth of the human average  <cit> . the length of some adam <dig> introns is close to the theoretical minimum  <cit> . moreover, adam <dig> appears to have lost an intron which is present in other adam genes.

the present results indicate several transcription start sites for human adam <dig>  in contrast to the single start site reported for the mouse gene  <cit> . their location suggested the promoter position within a cpg island proximal to the translation start, which was confirmed by the reporter expression experiments. the wide tissue distribution of adam <dig> expression is consistent with the cpg-rich promoter type  <cit> . consistent with the presence of multiple transcription starts, the promoter lacks caat and tata boxes, and contains a cluster of conserved sp1/gc-box motifs.

while significant extra-promoter transcriptional regulatory elements were not found upstream of the adam <dig> promoter, the introns  <dig> and  <dig> contain highly conserved regions with clusters of conserved regulatory motifs. these could contribute to the transcriptional regulation since genomic sequence conservation is considered to indicate purifying selection and thus functional importance  <cit> . alternatively, these regions could play a role in the splicing of the exons  <dig> or  <dig>  since the intronic splice-regulatory elements typically lie within  <dig> bp from exons  <cit> , the central location of the conserved region in the intron  <dig> argues against a role in splicing whereas the conserved intron  <dig> region adjacent to exon  <dig> could be associated with its splicing. a third alternative explanation, that these regions were regulatory or coding parts of a gene in the complementary strand, is unlikely since no evidence was found for a complementary gene. the possible role of these conserved regions remains elusive.

the expression of adam <dig> appears to be remarkably regulated at the post-transcriptional level. for the first time, the present results demonstrate that normal human tissues display different complex patterns of at least  <dig> adam <dig> variants. yamamoto and coworkers have earlier demonstrated the presence of adam <dig> mrna variants corresponding to human v <dig> and v <dig> in mouse cell lines and some tissues  <cit> . the shortest adam <dig> variant  has also been reported from cultured human cells  <cit> . here, the fpcr method enabled identification of several novel variants as well as more precise and quantitative examination of the variant profiles. otherwise the studies so far have considered the adam <dig> variant  <dig> as "the" adam <dig> and potential contribution of other variants has not been addressed.

all permutations of the alternative adam <dig> exons were not detected, suggesting that certain exon combinations are not generated or that they are unstable. the low levels of some variants might at least partially be due to their potential susceptibility to nmd, since their translation stop codon is located further than  <dig> nt upstream from an exon-exon junction  <cit> . consistently, the variants 7a/b,  <dig>  and  <dig>  containing a potential nmd-targeting stop codon in the exon  <dig>  were detected at very low levels. variants lacking the exon  <dig> and containing the 21b, which would also contain a potential nmd-targeting stop codon, were not detected. in contrast, the stop codon in variants  <dig> and  <dig> is located only  <dig> nt upstream of the exon 22/ <dig> junction and thus these variants should not be targeted to nmd. correspondingly, the variant  <dig> was detected in several tissues at relatively high levels. the low level of variants 3a/b suggests that transcripts containing the exon 20a/b as the only alternatively used exon might not be efficiently generated.

chance skipping of exons with weak splice signals could as such lead to complex splice patterns. however, the distinct adam <dig> splice variant patterns in cell lines and tissues indicate stringent regulation by specific factors. alternative use of the corresponding exons in humans and rodents indicates at least some conservation of regulatory mechanisms, which should appear as conserved elements in the gene sequence. hence, the human and rodent adam <dig> genes were comparatively examined for conserved alternative splicing-associated sequence motifs.

splicing is primarily regulated through modulation of splice and branch site recognition and subsequent spliceosome assembly  <cit> . the binding strength of u <dig>  u2afs, and u <dig> snrnps to their complementary sequences determines how easily the splice and branch sites will be skipped. this is further controlled by regulatory proteins which either facilitate or suppress the splice site selection depending on the type of the binding protein and the location of the binding site. the regulatory motifs are classified into exonic and intronic splice enhancers  and silencers   <cit> . however, this nomenclature is not unambiguous; e.g., an ess can enhance the splice site recognition if located within an intron  <cit> . also the relative location within an exon or intron can influence the mode  or potency of some regulatory elements  <cit> .

the alternatively used adam <dig> exons appear to lack strong exon definition. weak splice donor and branch sites, atypical 5'ss sequences, in particular a non-consensus nucleotide at + <dig> position, and low ese numbers have been associated with alternative exon use  <cit> . thus the weak 5' splice and branch sites, substitution of the + <dig> g in the 5'ss, and the scarcity of eses indicate that the alternative adam <dig> exons might be predisposed to skipping due to little exonic splice enhancement and inefficient splice site recognition. on the other hand, they are almost devoid of exonic suppression elements, i.e. ess and hnrnp binding motifs. hence, the alternative adam <dig> splicing is likely not controlled through exonic but rather through intronic motifs, consistently with the abundance of splice enhancer and repressor motifs in the flanking introns.

the available data do not allow prediction of the exact regulatory role of individual motifs but some suggestions can be made based on their location, type, and conservation. the hnrnps have been shown to regulate alternative splicing through competitive pre-mrna binding  <cit> . the conserved hnrnp i binding motifs in the intron- <dig> pyrimidine tract close to the u2af site and the hnrnp h/f and b/d/a <dig> binding motifs close to the 5'ss in introns 21a and 21b, respectively, are potential splice-regulatory sites for which the hnrnp might compete. the hnrnps have also been suggested to regulate alternative splicing through rna loop-out mechanisms, in which homotypic interaction of pre-mrna-bound hnrnps enhances the use of splice sites by bringing them into proximity  <cit> . on the other hand, the model posits that if the looped-out rna segment includes splice site, the corresponding exon would be skipped. the number and location of hnrnp h/f binding motifs in introns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggest that a looping-out mechanism may regulate splicing of the alternative adam <dig> exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

the introns flanking the alternatively used adam <dig> exons contain several eses, sr-protein binding motifs, and esss possibly regulating the splice site use. the eses and sr-protein binding to motifs near the branch sites in the introns  <dig> and  <dig> may affect the downstream exon splicing via regulating branch site and 3'ss complex formation  <cit> . the sr-binding motifs just downstream of the exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> could enhance their splicing by facilitating u <dig>  u2af, and u <dig> binding  <cit> . eses and sr-binding motifs in the unique region of exon 21b might enhance the distal 5'ss use. however, the esss in this region might enhance the selection of weak intron 21a 5'ss over the downstream 21b 5'ss. this could suppress the exon 21b use, as suggested by a recent study of the general role of intronic ess motifs  <cit> .

fox-family proteins  <cit>  are obvious candidate regulators of alternative adam <dig> splicing, suggested by the conserved fox-binding motifs in the introns  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the fox proteins have been shown to specifically affect the alternative splicing of their targets in several tissues  <cit> . fox-binding elements have been shown to function as downstream splice enhancers or upstream silencers in mammals  <cit> , and it remains to be elucidated which fox-intron interactions might regulate the alternative splicing of individual adam <dig> exons.

the cugcua and augcau motifs have also been associated with alternative splicing  <cit>  although their cognate regulatory proteins have not been identified. their location close to the 5'- and 3'ss in adam <dig> intron  <dig>  and conservation of the cugcua between human and rat, suggest that these motifs might contribute to the regulation of alternative use of adam <dig> exon  <dig> 

other potential intronic regulatory elements in the alternatively spliced adam <dig> region are the conserved recognition motifs for splice factors of nova, celf, and mbnl families. these proteins regulate alternative splicing mostly as intronic upstream splice silencers and downstream enhancers  <cit> . however, their competitive binding with any splice factors could have an effect independently of the relative exon position. the uneven distribution of motif types in adam <dig> introns suggests that each of these splice factor families could affect the splicing of adam <dig> exons differently.

alternative exon use might provide a novel physiological mechanism for functional adam <dig> regulation. differential splicing of the three cytosolic-encoding exons in human tissues indicates differential regulation of adam <dig> variant production. this regulation appears to be disturbed in cancer cells which show aberrant adam <dig> variant patterns  <cit> . however, it remains to be investigated whether the adam <dig> mrna variants are translated into protein isoforms in human tissues. endogenous production of a longer adam <dig> protein isoform has been demonstrated in cultured mouse cells  <cit> . although the molecular function of adam <dig> is poorly understood it has been associated with e.g. cell migration. in one cell type adam <dig> enhanced cell migration  <cit>  whereas it inhibited motility in another  <cit> , suggesting different function in different cells. it is intriguing to speculate that the differential splicing of adam <dig> transcripts could be a regulatory mechanism for such differences.

an obvious consequence of alternative adam <dig> splicing is the differential propensity of adam <dig> protein isoforms to regulatory cytosolic interactions. thus alternative splicing could affect the cytosolic regulation of adam <dig> function or subcellular targeting. the cytosolic region of the deduced adam <dig> isoforms contains different sets of recognition motifs for signaling and adaptor protein interaction domains such as sh <dig>  several cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases, mitotic control factors, and cytoskeletal adaptors have been shown to interact with "the" adam <dig>   <cit> . yamamoto and coworkers have demonstrated that mouse adam <dig> isoform corresponding to human isoform- <dig> bound more strongly to src family proteins than the "normal" form  and this interaction was enhanced by a phorbol ester in mouse cells, a treatment known to activate adam metalloproteases  <cit> . our unpublished results indicate differential sh3-interactions for human adam- <dig> isoforms in vitro.

the intron/exon structure and deduced protein sequences indicate that adam <dig> comprises a subfamily with adams  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the similarity suggests that the subfamily members may share functional and/or regulatory characteristics. adam <dig> is the only subfamily member for which the alternative use of the corresponding exons in the cytosolic-encoding region is conserved in between humans and mice. another difference is the apparently lost intron from the ectodomain-encoding part of human and mouse adam <dig> genes. its presence in almost all other adam genes indicates that this intron was deleted from an ancestral gene before the divergence of human and rodent lineages. the possible functional parallels with other subgroup members provide clues for further elucidation of the physiological and pathological roles and regulation of adam <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the human adam <dig> gene sequence, genomic structure, and promoter were characterized. for the first time, differential alternative adam <dig> splicing was demonstrated in normal human tissues, indicating that alternative exon use is a physiological post-transcriptional mechanism regulating adam <dig> expression. the genomic exon-intron structure is identical between human and rodent genes, and the considerable sequence-similarity of the human adam <dig> promoter with the corresponding region in mouse and rat, including several conserved transcription factor recognition motifs, suggests similarities in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. also, the alternative use of the same adam <dig> introns in human and mouse indicates conservation of at least some mechanisms regulating alternative splicing.

the present results provide important clues for further studies. knowledge of the adam <dig> gene structure and transcriptional control elements are important prerequisites for better understanding of its mis-regulation in cancers and other diseases as well as for the elucidation of its physiological role. as alternative splicing is emerging as an important mechanism increasing the functional diversity of gene expression, characterization of the regulation mechanisms of alternative adam <dig> exon use will also provide novel information of alternative splicing in general. adam <dig> is particularly useful for monitoring changes in splice-regulation because the variant profiles arising from the alternative use of the three tandemly located exons can be readily examined with the straightforward and sensitive fpcr assay.
