BACKGROUND
nonsense-mediated mrna decay  is one of a number of rna surveillance pathways that help to ensure the fidelity of gene expression by degrading mrnas that lack the proper arrangement of translational signals . as the name suggests, nmd is responsible for recognizing and degrading mrnas that contain premature termination codons . in mammals, a termination codon is generally defined as premature by its spatial relationship to exon-exon junctions. the presence of one or more junctions at a distance of > 50- <dig> nucleotides downstream of the termination codon marks the mrna for destruction  <cit> . the biochemical basis of this effect is an interaction between the exon junction complex , a large multi-protein complex that is deposited on the mrna as a result of splicing, and the complex formed at the stop codon by the terminating ribosome during the first round of translation  <cit> . this interaction is mediated by the essential nmd factors upf <dig>  upf <dig> and upf <dig> . furthermore, in a number of metazoans, the phosphorylation state of upf <dig> is regulated by the factors smg <dig> and smg5- <dig> , which is required for nmd to take place  <cit> . until recently the position of any downstream ejcs was thought to be the primary determinant of a ptc in mammals. recent studies, however, have shown that the distance from the ptc to various cues within the 3' utr  can also play an important role in defining termination events as aberrant  <cit> . this is in a similar fashion to those organisms, such as s. cerevisiae, c. elegans and drosophila melanogaster, where the ejc is absent or plays no role in nmd, and is thought to reflect a primordial mechanism of ptc recognition upon which, in mammals, the ejc has been superimposed  <cit> .

apart from its role in dealing with unintended errors in gene expression, nmd has a well documented role in regulating the abundance of many physiological transcripts in all model organism examined to date  <cit> . moreover, many nmd factors are now known to have additional functions extending beyond nmd . the difference between species in those genes regulated by nmd is thought to be the cause of the differing phenotypes of animals in which upf <dig> has been removed  <cit> . amongst these, mus musculus lacking upf <dig> are embryonic lethal  <cit> , indicating that upf <dig>  and presumably nmd, plays an important role in mammalian physiology and development. nmd-regulated transcripts can be divided into two broad categories. first those mrnas that "normally" possess a ptc. these include transcripts that contain upstream open reading frames  within their 5' utr, or in which a ptc is introduced as the result of a regulated alternative splicing event , including those transcripts with an intron more than 50- <dig> nt into the 3'utr such that the coding sequence  termination codon appears premature  <cit> . secondly, those mrnas where nmd is co-opted as a decay mechanism through the interaction of upf <dig> with a protein that recognizes a specific set of mrnas. two examples are staufen- <dig>  mediated decay  and the decay of certain replication-dependent histone mrnas at the end of s-phase of the mammalian cell cycle  <cit> . in both cases a protein recognizes a specific cis-element within the 3' utr and also interacts with upf <dig>  <cit> . mrna degradation is then triggered in a fashion that is dependent on upf <dig> and active translation, but independent of the other upf proteins  <cit> .

previous large-scale investigations into the role of upf1/nmd in regulating physiological gene expression in metazoans have focused on changes in mrna abundance  <cit> . in this study we have sought to deepen our understanding of the role of upf <dig> in regulating physiological gene expression by examining the changes in protein expression in response to sirna mediated depletion of upf <dig> in hela cells, using the expression proteomics technique 2d difference gel electrophoresis . we observed a large number of alterations in protein levels; both increases and decreases. by analyzing the levels of the corresponding mrnas after treatment with either sirnas against upf <dig> or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide we were able to identify a small group of bona fide nmd targets; indicating that upf1's role in regulated gene expression may be more limited than previously thought. however, the majority of these bona fide nmd targets contained recognizable nmd-activating features, such as splicing dependent ptcs, introns in the 3'utr and uorfs. from among these we identified a highly conserved as-nmd event with the 3' utr of the hnrnpa2b <dig> gene, which appears to be involved in the autoregulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> mrna levels.

RESULTS
mrna stabilized as a result of the inhibition of nmd is translated to yield protein
before embarking upon a proteomic analysis of the consequences of upf <dig> knockdown we carried out a proof of principle experiment to demonstrate that mrnas stabilised by inhibition of nmd could be translated to yield protein. to this end we constructed the pgfpint reporter plasmid, containing an efficiently spliced artificial intron  in the 3' utr. splicing of the intron creates an exon-exon junction  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the gfp stop codon, making it appear premature and hence the mrna nmd sensitive. a cell line stably expressing pgfpint was constructed and subjected to knockdown of nmd factors upf <dig>  upf <dig> and smg <dig> or transfection with a control sirna, c <dig>  depletion of upf <dig> and upf <dig> protein was achieved to levels less than  <dig> % of control, as estimated by western blot . in the absence of an antibody against smg <dig> the reduction in smg <dig> mrna was measured by qpcr. a reduction to levels approximately 35% of control was achieved . both gfp mrna  and protein  showed a large increase in response to upf <dig> knockdown, a much smaller increase in response to upf <dig> knockdown and an intermediate response to smg <dig> knockdown. analysis of pgfpint mrna by rt-pcr indicated that the artificial intron was entirely spliced .

to further examine the differing response of pgfpint to the knockdown of different nmd factors, the levels of the nmd sensitive isoforms of sc <dig>  were examined by qpcr . interestingly, the pattern of changes in the sc <dig> isoforms mirrored that of pgfpint mrna: upf <dig> knockdown provoked the largest fold change followed by smg <dig> and then upf <dig>  given the high degree of knockdown achieved for all the factors examined, it appears that nmd of pgfpint and sc <dig>  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb mrna is differentially sensitive to the knockdown of upf <dig>  upf <dig> or smg <dig>  this phenomenon has been described previously and is thought to reflect distinct branches of the nmd pathway with differential requirements for upf <dig>  <cit> . since the inception of this work two further reports of similar nmd reporter systems support our conclusion that mrnas stabilized as a result of nmd inhibition are active substrates for translation  <cit> . indeed, this idea is also borne out by published data from more physiological circumstances  <cit> .

a multi-gel 2d-dige study of upf <dig> knockdown in hela cells reveals numerous changes in protein expression
to identify global changes in protein expression in response to upf <dig> knockdown we performed a multi-gel 2d-dige study of hela cells in which upf <dig> had been depleted by rna interference . samples were harvested  <dig> h after the second sirna hit on the basis that this provided sufficient time to observe the primary consequences of upf <dig> knockdown, while minimizing any secondary indirect effects. the basic principle of 2d-dige is that protein extracts from two different biological situations  are differentially labelled with fluorescent dyes before being mixed and fractionated by 2d gel electrophoresis  <cit> . the fluorescent image of the gel is then examined to identify protein spots where one fluorescent dye predominates indicating the change in expression of one or more of the constituent proteins between the two biological situations  <cit> . the protein spot is then excised from the gel and its composition determined by mass spectrometry  <cit> .

in order to identify changes that were specific to upf <dig> knockdown, we examined the response of hela cells to treatment with two different sirnas against upf <dig>  upf1_a and upf1_b, compared to a control sirna, c <dig> . the efficacy of upf <dig> knockdown, as assessed by western blot, was > 75% for both sirnas . effective depletion of upf <dig> was further confirmed in parallel rna samples by rt-pcr for an as-nmd event within u2af <dig>  <cit>  . the proportion of the nmd sensitive upper isoform, u2af35c, was clearly enriched upon treatment with upf1_a or upf1_b, confirming functional impairment of the nmd pathway.

the 2d-dige multi-gel study resulted in identification of a large number of both upward and downward changes in protein expression . as expected, many but not all changes were common to both sirnas . of the  <dig> spots detected in the analysis,  <dig> spots increased in expression in response to upf1_a treatment while  <dig> spots increased in expression in response to upf1_b treatment. of the upward changes,  <dig> were common to both sirnas. furthermore, upf1_a treatment resulted in  <dig> spots decreasing in abundance while  <dig> spots decreased in abundance in response to upf1_b treatment. of the downward changes,  <dig> were common to both sirnas.

multivariate statistical analysis provides an alternative method to student's t-test for identifying patterns in large multivariate datasets such as that generated by the 2d-dige multi-gel study  <cit> . abundance data from all spots  for all samples was subject to principle component analysis  to examine how the experimental samples clustered on the basis of all spot changes. the scores scatter plot for the first two principal components revealed a separation between c <dig> and the two upf <dig> knockdown conditions along pc <dig> . interestingly, there is no apparent separation between upf1_a and upf1_b treated samples. this was also the case when other pcs were examined . this suggests that despite the appearance that some spots change with one sirna but not the other, most spots undergo correlated changes in response to both sirnas, although one change or the other may not achieve significance in the univariate sense.

in order to identify which proteins were responsible for the observed increases in expression, and hence are candidate upf <dig> targets,  <dig> of the protein spots that had increased in expression were excised for identification by mass spectrometry . spots were picked first from those that had changed significantly in response to both upf1_a and upf1_b. then, on the basis of the pca, others were picked that had changed significantly in response to either sirna, starting with those that had narrowly escaped significance with the second sirna.  <dig> down-regulated spots were also picked, from those that had decreased significantly in response to both sirnas . of the  <dig> up-regulated spots,  <dig> yielded sufficient material to allow protein identification, whereas of the  <dig> down-regulated spots,  <dig> yielded sufficient material. for each spot, potential protein constituents were identified from liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of trypic peptides produced by in-gel digestion, using the mascot search engine  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> unique proteins were identified from up-regulated spots and  <dig> from down-regulated spots. some proteins were identified in more than one spot, including  <dig> that were found in both up- and down-regulated spots. this could be due to post-translational modification of the proteins, or the existence of isoforms that are different in size or pi, but are indistinguishable by their tryptic peptide pattern. information on the identified proteins and peptide sequences, along with the change observed for each spot is detailed in additional file  <dig> 

validation of nmd targeted mrnas
in order to determine which of the identified proteins represented bona fide nmd targets, two rounds of qpcr validation were employed. in the first round we tested whether levels of the mrnas corresponding to the identified proteins were affected by upf <dig> knockdown mediated by upf1_a sirna. since nmd and the other upf1-dependent mrna decay pathways  are dependent on active translation  <cit> , we next measured changes in mrna levels following treatment of cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. for each gene of interest qpcr primers were designed to mrna regions not known to undergo alternative splicing, and eight replicate samples were used in order to achieve the same statistical power as the 2d-dige multi-gel study  <cit> . only genes that showed statistically significant increases  in response to both treatments were deemed to be genuine targets of nmd/upf1-dependent mrna decay.

the results of the qpcr validation are detailed in additional file  <dig> and summarised in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> mrnas corresponding to proteins from up-regulated spots,  <dig>  increased in response to upf <dig> knockdown, as expected of upf1/nmd targets. a further  <dig>  showed no significant change in expression,  <dig> decreased , while  <dig>  failed to produce an intelligible signal. strikingly, from the  <dig> down-regulated protein spots none of the  <dig> corresponding mrnas was down-regulated upon upf <dig> knockdown. eleven did not change significantly in expression,  <dig> failed to show an intelligible signal, while the remaining  <dig> actually increased in expression . while  <dig> of these  <dig> proteins were among those also found in up-regulated spots, it is striking that not a single one of the genes corresponding to the protein constituents of down-regulated spots showed an accompanying decrease in mrna expression. this suggests that upf <dig> knockdown has a negative role in the translational efficiency of at least some of these proteins.

the  <dig> validated upf <dig> target genes from up-regulated spots were then subjected to the second round of validation by cycloheximide treatment. of the  <dig> upf <dig> targets,  <dig>  increased in expression, as expected of authentic nmd targets . of the remainder, one  failed to give an intelligible signal,  <dig>  showed no significant change in expression, while  <dig>  actually decreased in expression. the  <dig> genes that did not increase in expression in response to cycloheximide treatment may represent secondary effects of upf <dig> knockdown or targets of upf <dig> in processes other than nmd.

with reference to the original 2d dige analysis, of the  <dig> upregulated spots that yielded protein identifications,  <dig>  contained at least one protein whose corresponding mrna was validated as being upregulated by knockdown of upf <dig>  and in  <dig> cases  the upregulated mrna corresponded to the major protein component of the spot, as indicated by mascot scores . of the  <dig> spots,  <dig>  contained proteins that were also upregulated by cycloheximide treatment. in five cases  the doubly validated nmd target corresponded to the major protein constituent of the protein spot, as judged by mascot scores, and so provides a clear explanation for the observed upregulation. a number of the other nmd targets were among the more abundant components of the spots in which they were identified . in the remaining cases , the doubly validated nmd targets represented relatively minor constituents of their resident spots. in four of these cases the spot also contained a more abundant validated upf <dig> target that was not cycloheximide upregulated.

the remaining  <dig> spots  contained no protein whose mrna was upregulated by upf <dig> knockdown. this suggests that relatively few of the changes in protein expression upon upf <dig> knockdown can be attributed directly to upf1's role in mrna decay. this result is in broad agreement with the more extensively validated studies of upf1's role in physiological gene expression  <cit> . 

identification of nmd activating features
we next sought to identify possible nmd activating features within the doubly validated genes. to this end, maximum transcript alignments  <cit>  of corresponding unigene clusters  <cit>  were generated using spa  <cit>  and examined for instances of: i) introns more than  <dig> nt downstream of the termination codon of the largest orf within a transcript, as an indication of as-nmd. ii) the presence of orfs upstream of the largest orf within a maximum transcript, as an indication of the presence of uorfs within the 5' utr. potential nmd sensitive maximum transcripts were then scored according to the number of peptides identified by mass spectrometry that were present within the protein sequence encoded by the largest orf of the maximum transcript. only transcripts encoding all of the identified peptides were considered as being potentially responsible for the observed upregulation of protein spots. for some genes, this step eliminated many potential nmd substrates. for example, the sfrs <dig> gene encodes the sr splicing regulatory protein 9g <dig>  which has a well characterized as-nmd event involving a "poison" cassette exon  <cit> . in this study however, the 9g <dig> peptides identified by mass spectrometry are not encoded by the alternatively spliced ptc-containing isoform. in contrast, many of the sfrs <dig> maximum transcripts contain one or two additional short uorfs upstream of the main protein coding orf.

of the  <dig> doubly validated genes, we found evidence of at least one nmd feature in  <dig> cases. notably, all five doubly validated genes that constituted the major components of their resident spots  had at least one nmd feature that was consistent with the peptide data. the most common features, found in  <dig> cases, were uorfs. in addition, there were three genes  with one or more alternative splicing events at a sufficient distance downstream of the main orf to activate nmd.

as-nmd events in th1l and napa
we next tested each of the as-nmd predictions by rt-pcr or qpcr. th1l was a relatively minor constituent of spot  <dig>  which was up-regulated  <dig>  fold in response to upf <dig> knockdown . th1l mrna was up-regulated approximately  <dig>  fold in response to upf <dig> knockdown and to a similar extent by cycloheximide . th1l is predicted to contain three as-nmd events: first, a  <dig> nt intron within its 3' utr, which when spliced causes the normal stop codon to appear premature . secondly, retention of the intron between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  thirdly, the use of an alternative 5' splice site within exon  <dig>  resulting in a frameshift that creates a ptc . the first two events are consistent with the peptide data, while one of the peptides lay downstream of the ptc introduced by use of the internal 5' splice site on exon  <dig>  thus ruling out the latter event as a contributor to the upregulation of protein spot  <dig>  rt-pcr was performed with primers flanking each as-nmd event to determine whether the ptc containing isoform was stabilised as a result of upf <dig> knockdown . the 3'utr splicing event and the exon  <dig> alternative 5' splice site event both showed a significant 2- <dig> fold increase in the proportion of the nmd sensitive isoform in response to upf <dig> knockdown, to a level of approximately 11% . in contrast, no effect of upf <dig> knockdown was seen upon the intron  <dig> retention event . taken together, the peptide and rt-pcr data therefore suggest that the 3'utr intron is the nmd feature responsible for the observed upregulation of th1l protein, but that both events contributed to upregulation of its mrna upon upf <dig> knockdown.

napa was the major component of spot  <dig>  which was upregulated ~ <dig>  fold by upf <dig> knockdown . likewise, napa mrna was upregulated  <dig>  -  <dig>  fold by upf <dig> knockdown and cycloheximide . napa has two predicted nmd features that are consistent with the  <dig> peptides that identified it. an alternatively spliced intron  <dig> nt into its 3'utr is at the threshold distance for inducing nmd . in addition, the 5'utr of a maximum transcript has overlapping  <dig> and  <dig> codon uorfs. qpcr was carried out to analyze levels of the isoforms in which the 3'utr intron was retained or spliced. levels of napa mrna with the intron spliced out  were elevated by ~ <dig>  fold after upf <dig> knockdown, whereas transcripts with the intron retained were not significantly affected , suggesting that the 3'utr intron is the feature responsible for the observed upregulation of the napa containing spot.

as-nmd mediated autoregulation of hnrnpa2b1
hnrnpa2b <dig> was the most abundant protein in spot  <dig>  which was upregulated  <dig>  -  <dig>  fold by the two upf <dig> sirnas . hnrnpa2b <dig> mrna showed an approximate two-fold increase upon upf <dig> knockdown and a small but significant increase upon cycloheximide treatment . bioinformatic analysis indicated that hnrnpa2b <dig> contains extensive alternative splicing within its 3' utr that would cause the normal stop codon to appear premature . as an nmd feature this would be consistent with the  <dig> peptides that identified hnrnpa2b <dig>  the predicted utr structure is, however, in conflict with the refseq annotation. in order to confirm the existence of the predicted nmd sensitive isoforms of the 3' utr, we performed 3' race  for hnrnpa2b <dig> on mrna taken from the upf <dig> knockdown rna samples used for validation. the resulting sequences were aligned to the genome using blat  <cit> . the race tags clearly support the 3' utr structure predicted from the unigene cluster; comprising three additional exons after that in which the hnrnpa2b <dig> cds ends . splicing of the final intron or inclusion of the first additional exon would create an exon-exon junction at sufficient distance downstream to make the normal stop codon appear premature. splicing of the final intron was examined by exon-junction specific qpcr and found to be up-regulated by  <dig> -fold upon upf <dig> knockdown , whereas a junction in the refseq mrna expected not be nmd sensitive  was not upregulated . the whole area of the 3' utr is very highly conserved , suggesting that as-nmd might be important in the regulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> levels. indeed full-length mrnas and ests representing similar utr structures can also be observed in the orangutan , other mammals  and even the chicken . while 3' utrs have many roles in regulating gene expression, any of which may result in the observed conservation  <cit> , many other genes of the hnrnp and sr protein families have been identified as containing such highly conserved as-nmd events  <cit> . indeed, murine hnrnpa2b <dig> was also identified as containing as-nmd by ni et al.  <cit> , although the event was not the same as reported here . many such conserved as-nmd events have been show to be subject to autoregulation by their own protein levels  <cit> . we examined whether this is also the case for hnrnpa2b <dig>  flag tagged hnrnpa <dig> isoform or an empty expression vector was transfected into hela cells in combination with a gfp expressing plasmid. gfp expressing cells were then isolated by flow cytometry in order to enrich for cells possessing the co-transfected plasmid. expression of flag-hnrnpa <dig> in the sorted cells was confirmed by western blot . the expression and splicing of hnrnpa2b <dig> was examined in parallel rna samples, using primers specific for the endogenous transcripts. overexpression of flag-hnrnpa <dig> reduced hnrnpa <dig> and hnrnpb <dig> mrna levels to 75-80% of control , demonstrating that hnrnpa <dig> protein can regulate hnrnpa2b <dig> mrna levels. examining the effect of overexpression on utr junctions a and b indicated that non-nmd sensitive junction a was decreased in expression to approximately 60% of control, while nmd sensitive junction b was increasing in expression by 20% over control levels . these results are consistent with hnrnpa2b <dig> regulating the abundance of its own mrna by altering splicing of the 3' utr to promote the production of isoforms degraded by nmd.

discussion
the role of upf1-dependent mrna decay in regulating physiological gene expression
we have demonstrated that the knockdown of upf <dig> in hela cells results in a large number of changes in protein expression but that only a minority of these can be attributed to upf1's characterized roles in nmd and other translation dependent mrna decay pathways. this result is in broad agreement with the more extensively validated studies of upf1's role in physiological gene expression  <cit> , suggesting that nmd plays a more restricted role in regulating gene expression than previously claimed  <cit> . for example, in order to measure the efficiency of nmd in cell lines expressing different amounts of rnps <dig>  viegas and colleagues sought to identify genuine nmd target genes from genes identified by microarray as upregulated upon upf <dig> knockdown  <cit> . they examined both the abundance of the fully processed mrna and pre-mrna, finding that in the majority of cases  both were upregulated. this indicates that the increase in mrna levels was likely to be a transcriptional effect rather than due to the direct action of nmd  <cit> .

the majority of the  <dig> confirmed nmd targets  have not been previously identified by microarray studies of upf <dig> dependent gene expression in mammals  <cit> , indicating the complementarity of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. however, given the bias of 2d-dige towards higher abundance proteins, it may be that this mechanism is more pertinent for genes with lower absolute expression levels. recent findings have indicated that the distance between the stop codon and poly tail can also be an important determinant of nmd . however, we were unable to find an over-representation of greater 3' utr lengths within our set of doubly validated genes . we believe that it is relevant that all of the identified nmd activating features within the  <dig> doubly validated nmd targets were either uorfs or introns positioned in the 3'utr or towards the 3' end of the transcript. as a result the detected proteins would all represent regular full-length isoforms, and would be expected to be stable. the protein products produced from other stabilized as-nmd substrate mrnas might be inherently unstable due to their truncated nature. this would argue against the functional roles often proposed for these products  <cit> . in support of this, we observed that the potential truncated ptb isoform, encoded by the as-nmd targeted mrna in which exon  <dig> is skipped  <cit> , is not detectably expressed from cdna expression vectors  unless proteasome activity is inhibited by the proteasomal inhibitor mg <dig> . this suggests that the inherent instability of some protein products might preclude their identification as nmd targets by proteomic approaches. nevertheless, a pilot dige experiment did not reveal a noticeable increase in upregulated spots when upf <dig> knockdown was analyzed under conditions of proteasome inhibition by mg- <dig> , suggesting that our current investigation has not suffered substantially from this potentially confounding effect.

in addition to identifying genuine nmd targets, our validation strategy also highlighted a number of other interesting groups. first, those proteins whose mrna was not up-regulated by upf <dig> knockdown may represent targets of nonsense mediated translational repression , wherein ptc containing mrnas apparently escape nmd but do not produce detectable levels of protein  <cit> . secondly, those genes that were upregulated by upf <dig> knockdown but not upregulated by cycloheximide treatment. an interesting feature of these  <dig> unusual upf <dig> targets is an enrichment of heat shock proteins of the hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> classes . in s. cerevisiae a specialized mrna decay pathway, termed initiation dependent decay, operates under conditions where translation initiation is down-regulated but not abolished  <cit> . of particular interest, initiation dependent decay targets a variety of heat shock proteins, including hsp <dig> and  <dig>  and is dependent upon upf <dig> and upf <dig>  while our experiments were not carried out under conditions where translation initiation is expected to be impaired, they suggest that initiation dependent decay may be relevant to mammalian systems. however, this observation could also be the result of a shared transcriptional activator of these heat-shock proteins being nmd sensitive, but generally translationally down-regulated by cyclohexamide. thirdly, analysis of the spots that were down-regulated upon upf <dig> knockdown indicate yet another potentialiy interesting group of upf <dig> targets. none of the mrnas corresponding to the protein constituents of these spots were down-regulated by upf <dig> knockdown; indeed some were actually upregulated. this suggests that upf <dig> may play a role in the synthesis or degradation of these proteins. given upf1's known roles, it seems more likely that it acts at the translational level and that for these proteins upf <dig> has a positive influence on their translation.

uorfs as nmd features
the most prevalent nmd activating feature predicted for the doubly validated nmd targets was the presence of uorfs. indeed, two of our confirmed cases that can be explained by uorfs have previously been identified as as-nmd targets. sfrs <dig>  is already a well-characterised example of as-nmd  <cit> , our finding that some isoforms may also possess a uorf indicate that sfrs7's post-transcriptional regulation may be more complex than previously appreciated, as recently described for sfrs <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, a cct <dig> alternative isoform was reported to be sensitive to the translation inhibitor emetine by as-sensitive microarray  <cit> .

a priori it might be expected that all uorf containing mrnas would be nmd sensitive. the termination codon of the uorf would be premature with regard to the exon-exon junctions within the cds, and would likely be at great distance from signals in the 3' utr determining proper translation termination. this, however, does not appear to be the case as uorfs often mediate translational repression of the protein coding orf without an accompanying decrease in mrna abundance  <cit> . moreover, inhibition of nmd in c. elegans results in the upregulation of only some transcripts bearing uorfs  <cit> . so what characteristics make a uorf baring transcript nmd sensitive? uorf length has been shown to be important; short open reading frames or those that have been translated more quickly favour translation reinitiation downstream  <cit> , possibly by the remaining association of translation inititiation factors with the ribosome  <cit> . reinitiation then inhibits nmd  <cit> . so nmd sensitive uorfs might be expected to be longer than average, or composed of sequence that results in slow translation. ramani et al.  found a weak correlation between the kozak consensus at the start codon of the protein coding orf and the extent to which the uorf containing transcript was up-regulated in nmd deficient c. elegans  <cit> . calvo and colleagues examined the effect of various uorf characteristics on reduction in protein expression. they found that uorf containing 5' utrs, when examined in a heterologous system, generally exerted a greater effect on protein abundance  than mrna abundance . similar trends were observed in published datasets they examined. the decreasing protein expression correlated with stronger context at the uaug, a greater cap-uorf distance  and, to a lesser extent, an increasing number of uorfs. in the case of a single uorf, uorf length and uorf-cds distance did not correlate with the extent of protein repression. the absolute amplitude of changes in mrna abundance are similar to those observed for our predicted uorf carrying genes. unfortunately the relationship of these variables with decreasing mrna abundance, which we might presume to be due to nmd, was not examined  <cit> .

we have been unable to find any characteristics that distinguish the uorfs in our doubly validated nmd targets from others . however, uorf mediated regulation is often complex, involving not only the uorfs themselves but also interactions with other conserved sequences and trans-acting factors  <cit> . indeed, the relatively small fold changes in mrna level observed during validation indicate that in each case only a proportion of the mrna is nmd-sensitive, suggesting that some sort of probabilistic event is responsible. thus, it is not clear that identification of a uorf is currently a powerful predictor of nmd sensitivity. a larger dataset and broader scope of analysis may prove more fruitful in finding some association between specific uorf characteristics, or groups thereof, and nmd-sensitivity.

autoregulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> via as-nmd
we have identified a highly conserved example of autoregulatory as-nmd within the hnrnpa2b <dig> gene. the hnrnp family of proteins plays many roles in rna metabolism  <cit> . hnrnpa2b <dig> itself has been shown to regulate both alternative splicing  <cit>  and mrna stability  <cit> . our data is consistent with hnrnpa2b <dig> activating splicing within it's own utr to produce nmd sensitive forms that account for the decrease in total gene expression: over-expression of the hnrnpa <dig> isoform resulted in down-regulation of a <dig> and b <dig> isoform expression and the up-regulation of one of the nmd-sensitive exon junctions within the 3' utr . for simplicity we measured two utr exon-exon junctions that would always be expected to be nmd sensitive, but the splicing patterns involved are almost certainly more complex.

while hnrnp a/b proteins were initially characterised as splicing repressors  <cit> , it has recently been shown that intronic binding of hnrnp a1/a <dig> proteins can activate splicing, particularly of elongated introns  <cit> . this is thought to proceed by homophilic interactions between a2/a <dig> proteins bound at separate sites  causing the looping out of portions of intron, which in turn results in promoting the splicing of said intron  <cit> . we have not examined whether hnrnpa2b <dig> directly binds to its own utr, but motifs thought to represent bindings sites for hnrnpa <dig> and hnrnpa2b <dig>  are clearly present in the hnrnpa2b <dig> 3' utr introns we identified . this also raises the possibility that hnrnpa <dig> may also regulate these splicing events. indeed increased expression of hnrnpa <dig> has been observed to correlate with decreased hnrnpa2/b <dig> in some cancer cell lines  <cit> .

as-nmd within hnrnp and sr protein genes has been shown to mediate quantitative regulation by repressing protein expression at inappropriate times  <cit>  or providing homeostatic regulation of protein levels through autoregulatory negative feedback  <cit> . our data is consistent with the later case. however, these two modes of regulation are not mutually exclusive, and it will be interesting to see whether biological circumstances can be identified where this as-nmd event is used to repress expression of hnrnpa2b <dig>  indeed, up-regulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> levels has pathological associations. increased hnrnpa <dig> expression has also been observed in pancreas and breast cancer  <cit> , and in the foetal brain of down's syndrome patients  <cit> . underscoring the functional relevance of these increases, increased expression of hnrnpa2b <dig> and ptbp <dig> has been shown to be responsible for the predominance of the pkm <dig> isoform that is the hallmark of many types of cancer, promoting the aerobic glycolysis that is important for cell growth  <cit> . furthermore, hnrnpa <dig> was recently shown to be responsible for splicing events that promote invasive migration of cancer cells in three-dimensional matrices  <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
despite the large number of changes in protein expression upon upf <dig> knockdown, our two-stage validation shows that a relatively small fraction of them can be directly attributed to the action of nmd on the corresponding mrna. this indicates that the role of nmd in directly regulating gene expression may be less prominent than previously suggested. the majority of the doubly-validated mrnas contain computationally predicted uorfs, confirming this feature as an indicator of nmd sensitivity. we have also identified three examples of as-nmd, including a highly conserved as-nmd event that appears to mediate autoregulation of hnrnpa2b <dig> expression levels. this extends the observation that many rna binding proteins auto-regulate their own expression through highly conserved elements. consideration of this autoregulation will be important when examining biological situations, such as several types of cancer, where hnrnpa2b <dig> levels are deregulated.
