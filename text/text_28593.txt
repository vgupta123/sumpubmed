BACKGROUND
crambe abyssinica  is an allohexaploid  with an estimated genome size of approximately  <dig>  gb based on its 2c-value  . a member of the genus crambe abyssinica distribute unevenly among four major geographical regions: macronesian, mediterranean, east africa, and euro-siberian-southwest asia  <cit> . c. abyssinica originated from the mediterranean region and has been cultivated mainly for producing high-erucic acid plant oil, a natural product of interest to the chemical industry  <cit> . its breeding and cultivation first started in europe from the 1900s, and then subsequently spread throughout the world  <cit> . previous efforts in improving crambe’s agronomic traits included traditional breeding  <cit> , mutagenesis, and transgenesis . despite obvious improvement on agronomic traits, genetic and genomic information on this oilseed crop is still largely limited. so far, only a few hundred nucleotide sequences of dna and rna in c. abyssinica were deposited in public database , markedly incomparable to other oil crops, e.g. brassica napus, soy bean, peanut or sunflower. the paucity of available information on nucleotide sequences has hindered its genetic studies, such as molecular marker development, linkage map construction and gene discovery.

the next-generation sequencing  technologies have significantly increased the speed and throughput of sequence information acquisition, and greatly accelerated the discovery process for molecular markers e. g. single nucleotide polymorphisms  and ssr  <cit> . although snp markers are popular and widely applied in major crops, snp detection usually requires expensive chemistries and equipment which limited its application. ssr markers are technologically less demanding and have advantages including high level of polymorphism, low cost, reproducibility and transferability across species. for example, a total of  <dig> barley est-derived ssr primer pairs were tested for transferability to h. chilense, all of which amplified products of correct size from this species  <cit> . moreover, in some species, ssrs were found to be more informative than snps, for instance singh et al.  <cit>  compared the use of ssr and snp markers in estimation of genetic diversity and population structure of indian rice varieties, and concluded that ssr were more efficient for diversity analysis.

in the study, we have employed the ngs sequencing technology to sequence genomic dna and est of crambe abyssinica with the goals of characterizing simple satellite repeat loci and developing corresponding markers. our study demonstrated the procedures for developing ssr markers for c. abyssinica, facilitated by the use of the next-generation sequence technology. the developed ssr markers were utilized to evaluate the genetic diversity of crambe accessions, which exhibit a moderate level of genetic differentiation in c. abyssinica and a correspondingly estimated gene flow. the nucleotide sequences generated in present study including the ssr-primers and the assembled genomic and transcriptomic contigs are freely available to the research community, and will serve as useful genetic resource for this species.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of transcriptomic and genomic dna of crambe abyssinica
the total rna of developing crambe seeds  was isolated and synthesized cdna was sequenced by illumina pair-end 100 ×  <dig>  from which a total of  <dig>  gb sequence data were generated. the deduced coverage of the transcriptome was about 20×. the raw data were processed using q <dig> quality control and l <dig> length filtering. the remaining raw reads were assembled using the trinity program to generate contigs. a total of  <dig>  contigs were generated from the de novo assembly of cdna. then, the contigs were filtered using blastn  to remove those with high similarity. finally  <dig>  contigs  remained for est-ssr calling. the lengths of the contigs varied from 100 bp to > 10 kb with the average  <dig>  bp . the genomic dna isolated from fresh leaves was sequenced by illumina similar to that of the cdna. a total of  <dig>  gb raw data was obtained, indicating a  <dig> × depth of coverage. the raw data were processed with est data, except for being assembled by a ‘short oligonucleotide analysis package program de novo’ . finally,  <dig> , <dig> contigs  were assembled for genome-ssr calling . the average size of the contigs was 186 bp, and n <dig> is 275 bp with the longest sequence length of  <dig>  bp. figure  <dig> showed the distribution of the assembled est and genomic contigs according to their lengths. the est contigs between  <dig> to  <dig>  kb were the most abundant. among the genomic contigs, those within  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb were the most prevail in terms of contig appearance frequency, but the contigs within  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb were the most dominant in terms of the ratio in total length.table  <dig> summary of the de novo assembly of transcriptome and genome and ssr loci calling

ssr development, primer design and preliminary selection
ssr loci were called using the misa program from the assembled transcriptomic and genomic contigs. the parameters were designed for identifying perfect di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide motifs with a minimum of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> repeats, respectively. as showed in table  <dig>  among the de novo assembled contigs,  <dig>  cdna contigs out of  <dig>  , and  <dig>  genomic contigs out of  <dig> , <dig>  contained at least one ssr locus. on average, there was one ssr locus in every  <dig>  kb cdna and  <dig>  kb genomic dna, respectively. eventually, a total of  <dig>  est derived ssr loci and  <dig>  genomic ssrs loci were detected. a total of  <dig> est-ssr motifs and  <dig> genomic ssr motifs were identified. of the est-ssr motifs, there were  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta and  <dig> hexa-nuleotide; and of the genomic ssr motifs, there were  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta and  <dig> hexa-nuleotide. the fig.  <dig> demonstrated the statistics in the ssr loci detected. of the est-ssr loci, trinucleotides accounted for 60 % and thus ranked the most abundant, followed by dinucleotides , hexanucleotides , tetranucleotides , and pentanucleotides  . while for the detected genomic-ssr loci, 50 % were dinucleotide motifs, followed by 26 % trinucleotides, 14 % hexanucleotides, 7 % tetranucleotides and 3 % pentanucleotide . the top ten most abundant nucleotide repeat types in the newly detected ssrs were presented in fig.  <dig>  with the most common est-ssr motif being aag/ctt and the most abundant genomic-ssr motif being ag/ct.fig.  <dig> ssrs statistics. the frequency distribution of the ssr motif was showed in the chart. the nucleotide repeat motif varied from di-nucleotide to hexa-nucleotide as showed by the x axis. the tri- and di-nucleotide were the most prevail in the est and genomic ssr respectively

primer pairs with melting temperatures  within the range of 55 °c to 61 °c and with amplicons within a size range of 150 bp to 400 bp were designed from the flanking sequences of the ssr loci by using the primer  <dig> program. primers were then validated by in silico pcr against the crambe genome contigs per se. those primer sets amplifying multiple target regions were discarded to ensure the specific locations of the primers. finally, a total of  <dig>  pairs of est-ssr primers  and  <dig>  genomic-ssr primer pairs  were obtained and the ratio between est- and genomic-ssr primer pairs was around 1: <dig> 

validating the primers with the whole-genome data of brassicaeace crops
brassica rapa, brassica olecera, and brassica napus belong to the same family brassicaceace as crambe. to assess the intergeneric homology of the newly developed crambe ssrs across brassicaceace, the est- and genomic-ssr primers were tested by in silico pcr against the genome of b. rapa, b. oelcera and b. napus. the maximum number of mismatches at the 5′ end is three base pairs, with none allowed at the 3′ end. the primer pairs that amplified a single band between 200 bp and 500 bp were considered as the preferred molecular markers. finally,  <dig> pairs of est-ssr primers and  <dig>  pairs of genomic-ssr primers were mapped onto b. rapa genome ,  <dig> and  <dig>  on b. olarecea ,  <dig> and  <dig>  on b. napus . the overlapped primers among three genomes were showed in fig.  <dig>  where  <dig> est-ssr primer pairs and  <dig> genomic-ssr primer pairs overlapped across all three genomes, suggesting the corresponding amplified loci are evolutionarily conserved in the family. according to the physical location, these primer pairs distributed at a frequency of one marker per 10 kb in brassica rapa and brassica olecera .fig.  <dig> the number of the primers mapped on genomes of brassica species. in the chart the numbers of the new primer-pairs which were mapped on b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus were showed as well as the number of the overlapped primer-pairs

evaluating the diversity of the c. abyssinica germplasm collections by using the newly developed ssr markers
a total of  <dig> primer pairs  consisting of  <dig> est-ssrs and  <dig> genomic-ssrs were selected and utilized in the pcr analysis of genomic dna from  <dig> crambe accessions to validate the utility and reliability of these ssr markers in c. abyssinica germplasm identification . in terms of geographic origins, the accessions can be classified into four groups: the mediterranean group , the middle european group , the western european group , and the usa group. amplified products were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.table  <dig> summary of the pcr analysis

results revealed that the tested est- and genomic-ssr markers were highly polymorphic among the accessions. the polymorphism information content  value of the primers varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . there were nine primer pairs showing no polymorphisms among the accessions. as shown in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig> alleles were detected in  <dig> accessions, wherein  <dig> alleles were determined to be accession-specific and  <dig> alleles were generally detected in all the accessions.

the genetic distances with the coefficient of nei <dig> among accessions ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the largest genetic distance was observed between galactica and pi <dig> from romania. unweighted pair group method analysis  was used to cluster the accessions, which indicated that the  <dig> accessions could be grouped accordingly into two clusters . cluster a included all the accessions except galactica and could be further subdivided into two sub-clusters. sub-cluster ai contained two groups: group  <dig> consisted of the accessions from the origin of c. abyssinica  and surrounding areas, whereas group  <dig> comprised one from iowa, us , two from indiana  and us, two accessions  from maryland, us. sub-cluster aii included three accessions from maryland , us and one  from new mexico, us and one  from germany. in comparison with other american accessions, the accessions collected from iowa and indiana had a closer relationship with the ones from mediterranean region and surrounding areas.fig.  <dig> tree-plot derived from upgma cluster analysis using nei <dig> coefficient of ssr markers. the upgma  tree-plot was generated using mega  <dig>  cluster analysis based on the genetic distances  of  <dig> independent accessions. the names and geographic originations of the accessions were listed in table  <dig>  the asterisk marks accession pi <dig> from germany



f-statistics analysis of the pcr results showed a generally moderate level of genetic differentiation among the accessions , and a corresponding low estimated gene flow . the accessions from the mediterranean region and surrounding areas  showed a similar degree of genetic differentiation . in addition, the accessions from the usa showed a relatively lower level of genetic differentiation and a higher estimated gene flow .

discussion
in present study, ssr markers for the hexoploid species crambe abyssinica from mediterranean region were developed based on de novo assembled cdna and genomic dna from cultivar galactica released by wageningen university, the netherlands. the reliability of these newly developed ssr primers was tested via pcr analysis on a total of  <dig> different crambe germplasm accessions, including the modern cultivars ‘prophet’ , ‘meyer’ , ‘belenzian’ , ‘belann’ , ‘c-22’ , ‘c-29’ , and ‘c-37’  from the usa and galactica from the netherlands. the upgma tree plot in fig.  <dig> showed a reasonable and conclusive topology that was consistent with the described breeding history of c. abyssinica  <cit> . for example, the figure showed ‘prophet’ and ‘meyer’ had closer relationship with the main accessions from mediterranean and neighboring areas than ‘c22’, ‘c29’, ‘c37’, belenzian and belann. it automatically reflected the fact that ‘prophet’ and ‘meyer’ were obtained from mass selection and crossing in two initial accessions from sweden and ethiopia; and ‘c22’, ‘c29’, ‘c37’, belenzian and belann also originated from these two initial accessions but with extra breeding process and longer term of selection  <cit> . the figure also showed that american accessions were rather isolated from those from european, asian, and african accessions. it indicated that although crambe breeding in usa was initiated in the1960s from the germplasms of european origin, the breeding effort since then was rather intensive and relatively independent. german accession pi <dig> was an exception which showed a close relationship with the accession from new mexico, usa. the information regarding this accession is limited in that it was collected by the institut fur pflanzengenetik und kulturpflanzenforschung, germany, and later donated to united states agricultural department, whereas its place origin was unclear. based on the estimated genetic distances, we deduced hypothesized that: 1) pi <dig> derived from late-breeding accessions; 2) it originated from a germplasm of the usa. galactica was also a european cultivar which is known as the latest cultivar. it shared its genetic background with all the accessions from usa, europe, and mediterranean region, because it was bred from a european landrace and a late american line  <cit> . f-statistics analysis based on pcr results indicated a moderate level of genetic differentiation among the  <dig> accessions examined , and gene flow was low . geographical isolation, as well as artificial breeding and selection, might have likely caused the genetic differentiation. the genetic differentiation within the usa accessions  was quite lower than that of the accessions from the mediterranean and surrounding areas . these findings indicated that: 1) the cultivation history of c. abyssnica in the usa was relatively shorter than that in the mediterranean and surrounding area; and 2) the crambe genetic resource in the usa was less abundant. the genetic differentiation approach based on the polymorphisms in the newly developed ssrs also demonstrated that those markers for c. abyssnica and the corresponding primers were reliable and robust.

among the de novo assembled contigs, it was found that  <dig>  % est-contigs  contained ssr loci, which was consistent with those of dicotyledonous plants, which ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %  <cit> . the frequency of genomic-ssr occurrence was one per  <dig>  kb which was lower than what has been reported in brassica species, for instance one locus every  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in the genome of b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus respectively  <cit> . it was mainly because that the mono-nucleotide repeat tandem was excluded in present research. the most abundant dinucleotide motif in crambe genome and est was poly , which was the same as arabidopsis genome and ests  <cit> , ests of brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis  <cit> , genome of b. rapa subsp chinensis  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit>  and raphanus sativus  <cit> . but in the genomes of b. napus, b. rapa subsp. pekinensis and b. oleracea, poly  was the most abundant  <cit> , when poly  ranks as the second  <cit> . in the est or genome ssr of arabidopsis and genus brassica, the occurrence of poly  was rare, which was as same as what has been found here. previous studies showed the trinucleotide tandem repeat occurred more frequently in coding region than in non-coding regions  <cit> . and in present research we also found that, relatively, there was more tri-nucleotide ssr in ests than in the genomic contigs. the most common triplet repeat detected in crambe est and genome was poly , which was the same in arabidopsis  <cit> , b. rapa  <cit> , b. napus, b. olarecea and many other plant species  <cit> . on the other hand, in c. abyssinica, the ssrs of tetra- and penta-nucleotide motifs were relatively rare when the hexa-nucleotide ssrs were abundant, in comparison with brassica crops  <cit> . but as same as brassica crops, the a/t rich motifs rich in for instance aac, aag, aat, aaac, aaag, aaat, aaaac, aaaag, aaaat and so on were dominant  <cit> . the pic values of the crambe ssr varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which was comparable to those of brassicaceae species and other plant reported  <cit> . previous research reported the intergeneric transferability of plant ssrs, for example the ssr primers developed from arabidopsis could be engaged in brassica species  and showed polymorphism  <cit> . in present research, the blast analysis also showed that there were a number of crambe ssrs could be mapped on the genomes of b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus. this suggested 1) the potential intergeneric transferability of the newly developed molecular markers in brassicaceae family; 2) the whole-genome sequence of brassica crops  <cit>  or arabidopsis  <cit>  could serve as references for genomic and genetic research studies on other brassicaceae species.

there were  <dig> pairs of primer selected for pcr validation where primers amplified single band in virtual pcr and evenly distributed throughout the brassica rapa genome. when they were employed for the pcr validation, most of these ssr primers however generated multiple bands. in  <dig> independent accessions, a total of  <dig> alleles were detected, and an average of  <dig> alleles was tested using each primer pair. a total of  <dig> alleles were generally observed among all accessions, suggesting that these genomic sequences were conserved and duplicated in the crambe genome. correspondingly,  <dig> alleles were found accession-specific. compared to the other accessions, galactica has the highest number of specific alleles, this finding was reasonable because the markers were designed based on its nucleotide sequences. also as the latest cultivars, galactica underwent a longer term of selection, the specific alleles probably correspond artificial selection effect. on the other hand, some primer pairs failed to generate any band patterns  in certain accessions, but no primer pair was unable to generate any polymorphic bands across accessions. this observation may be attributable to various technical reasons such as the primers were designed to cover splice sites; a large intron was present, or the cultivars harbored presence/absence variation. in the future, more cultivars will be sequenced with large genetic distance to better elucidate ssr locus variation and effectively developed corresponding ssr markers.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has developed a large set of ssr markers for c. abyssinica using high-throughput transcriptome and genome sequencing technologies.  <dig> of the identified primer pairs were used in the pcr analysis on  <dig> different accessions. results showed that: 1) 90 % of the primers generated polymorphic bands; 2) the pic value of the primers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ; and 3) the genetic distances between accessions ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . cluster analysis based on genetic distances demonstrated that the accessions could be classified into a manner that was consistent with crambe breeding history. f-statistics analysis of the pcr results showed that the genetic differentiation of c. abyssinica  was  <dig> , and its corresponding estimated gene flow  was  <dig> . these results suggested that due to geographical isolation and artificial selection, c. abyssinica has adapted moderate level of genetic differentiation and gene flow. ssr primers and sequence information developed in the present study are freely available to the research community, serving as a useful and robust resource for molecular taxonomy studies, linkage map construction, and molecular marker-assisted breeding.
