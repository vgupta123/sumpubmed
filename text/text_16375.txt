BACKGROUND
pasteurella pneumotropica is a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that is frequently isolated from the upper respiratory tract of laboratory rodents. this bacterium is a major causative agent of opportunistic infection in rodents, and almost all infected immunocompetent rodents exhibit unapparent infection. an earlier study reported that coinfection by p. pneumotropica and mycoplasma pulmonis causes pneumonia in specific pathogen-free mice  <cit> . a recent study reported that p. pneumotropica infection disturbs the inflammation responses in immunocompetent mice  <cit> . in immunodeficient rodents, however, p. pneumotropica infection leads to various serious diseases such as lethal pneumonia and sepsis. it is well known that coinfection with pneumocystis carinii and p. pneumotropica leads to fatal pneumonia in b cell-deficient mice  <cit> . in mice lacking functional mhc ii, tlr <dig>  and nramp <dig> genes, experimental challenge with p. pneumotropica results in pulmonary infections  <cit> . furthermore, orbital abscesses were caused by p. pneumotropica infection in cd28-mutated mice  <cit> . in laboratory rodents, these infections could be effectively treated with antibiotics  <cit> , and hysterotomy and embryo transfer are known to be the most effective treatments for eliminating p. pneumotropica completely  <cit> . however, both treatments are time-consuming and require special facilities and equipment. therefore, to prevent p. pneumotropica infection in laboratory rodents, it is necessary to periodically perform microbiological monitoring of laboratory rodents and maintain a clean environment in the rodent colony. to perform microbiological monitoring and prevent infection, it is important to clarify the virulence factors and pathogenicity of p. pneumotropica.

the phenotypic characteristics related to the virulence of p. pneumotropica are hemagglutination and hemolysis  <cit> . two recently named exoproteins, pnxia and pnxiia, both of which have c-terminal primary structures similar to the repeat in structural toxin  toxins, have been identified and characterized as hemolysin-like proteins in p. pneumotropica  <cit> . rtx toxins have many copies of glycine-rich sequences, and these toxins have been identified in many species of gram-negative bacterium, including pasteurellaceae, enterobacteriaceae, and vibrionaceae  <cit> . many rtx toxins are reportedly capable of lysing erythrocytes; thus, rtx toxins function as hemolysins  <cit> . in addition, several rtx toxins act as leukotoxins and disrupt actin cytoskeletons. ltxa produced by the periodontopathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans specifically acts on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages while concurrently lysing erythrocytes to acquire iron  <cit> . apx toxins  and lipopolysaccharides  are the major virulence factors for the porcine pathogen actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and the apx-lps complex promotes cytotoxicity toward porcine alveolar macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, the vibrio cholerae multifunctional autoprocessing rtx toxin, which acts on cellular actin protomers by cross-linking, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of cells  <cit> . as reported in recent studies, rtx toxins act on a variety of cells and cellular matrices and are considered to have various effects on host cells. therefore, elucidating the functions of rtx toxins may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which infectious agents cause infection.

in a previous study, we identified additional members of the rtx toxin family, namely, pnxia and pnxiia, in p. pneumotropica  <cit> . details about their functions and cytotoxicity, excluding their effects on sheep and mouse erythrocytes, remain to be clarified, and it is important to examine these proteins to prove that there are additional genes that code for proteins that are similar to rtx toxins; this is important for elucidating p. pneumotropica pathogenicity. in this study, we identified a third gene encoding an rtx protein and characterized it in terms of its in vitro cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity. to understand the function of this rtx protein, we attempted to determine its virulence characteristics based on its predicted primary structure.

RESULTS
identification of the third gene encoding an rtx protein
a previous study revealed that p. pneumotropica carries  <dig> genes encoding hemolysin-like proteins that are similar to the rtx toxins pnxia and pnxiia  <cit> . although both structural protein-coding genes could be detected using southern hybridization or pcr, several unspecific genes were also detected when the gene coding for pnxiia was targeted for detection by using pcr techniques in reference strains and wild-type strains of p. pneumotropica . in this study, this heterogenic pcr product was cloned, and the inserts of the resultant plasmid ptac-px <dig> were sequenced. the sequence of the inserts was similar to that of the glycine-rich regions in pnxiia; however, the detailed sequence indicated the existence of an additional gene that encodes a protein similar to the rtx toxin. subsequently, we sequenced the uninserted regions from the genomic dna of p. pneumotropica atcc  <dig> by using a previously constructed clone library  <cit>  and inverse pcr. approximately  <dig> kb of related genes, including  <dig> putative open reading frames , were finally identified . to predict the functions of the gene products, the deduced amino acid sequence of each gene was analyzed on the basis of hidden markov model  profiles with a protein blast search  <cit>  or the pfam database  <cit> . the pnxiii operon comprised the genes encoding  <dig> functional component proteins, namely, the ompa-like protein, rtx exoprotein, and type i secretion system component proteins . the deduced amino acid sequences of tolc, pnxiiib, and pnxiiid were similar to that of the putative outer membrane  efflux protein of neisseria sicca atcc  <dig>  with 68% similarity and 91% coverage, the lapa secretion atp-binding protein of neisseria mucosa atcc  <dig>  with 86% similarity and 99% coverage, and a membrane fusion protein of simonsiella muelleri atcc  <dig>  with 87% similarity and 100% coverage, respectively. the proteins from the  <dig> orfs were indicated to form a type i secretion system that transports the rtx protein across the bacterial inner membrane  and om and finally exports it into extracellular space.

the pnxiiie gene product contains the ompa domain  in the c-terminus and is 54% similar to the om protein a of cardiobacterium hominis atcc  <dig> , with 84% coverage.

although the protein blast search yielded no highly similar proteins, the deduced amino acid sequence of pnxiiia was partially similar  to the rtx family exoprotein of uropathogenic e. coli  cft <dig>  <cit>  , i.e., 59% coverage. pnxiiia is believed to be an essential cytotoxic protein of the structural rtx toxin.

cytotoxicity of rpnxiiia
to assess the virulence characteristics of pnxiiia, we determined its cytotoxicity toward j774a. <dig> mouse macrophage cells by using soluble rpnxiiia. with increasing rpnxiiia concentrations, the cytotoxicity as determined from the amount of lactose dehydrogenase  released by the cells was increased during a 24-h incubation . in addition, we examined and compared the cytotoxicity of  <dig> recombinant rtx proteins identified in p. pneumotropica toward j774a. <dig> cells. during a 4-h incubation, native rpnxia, rpnxiia, and rpnxiiia exhibited  <dig> % ±  <dig> %,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % cytotoxic to j774a. <dig> cells, respectively. compared with previously found rtx proteins, rpnxiiia was significantly less cytotoxic than rpnxia and rpnxiia . several rtx toxins have been recognized in a species-specific manner, and are found to be cytotoxic to leukocyte function-associated antigen- <dig> -bearing cells  <cit> . to characterize the cytotoxicity of pnxiiia toward j774a. <dig> mouse macrophage cells, it is important to assess the effect of the presence of the lfa- <dig> receptor in macrophage cells. furthermore, we employed comparative analysis of pnxiiia cytotoxicity by using parent j774a. <dig> cells and anti-cd11a monoclonal antibody -treated j774a. <dig> cells as a neutralizing antibody. figure  <dig> shows the changes in cytotoxicity of both j774a. <dig> cells and anti-cd11a mab-treated cells cultured with  <dig>  μg/ml rpnxiiia. during a 24-h incubation, approximately 20-50% of cytolysis was inhibited by the addition of anti-cd11a mab. these results indicate that the presence of the lfa- <dig> receptor may be required for rpnxiiia cytotoxicity toward j774a. <dig> cells.

ecm-binding ability and hemagglutination
figures 3a to 3d show the changes in absorbance at  <dig> nm  when rpnxiiia was gradually added to the ecm-coated 96-well plate; the changes in absorbance were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . rpnxiiia adhered to all tested rodent ecms, with adhesion increasing as the rpnxiiia concentration increased. in particular, the a <dig> of collagen type i  was highest among the tested rodent ecms, followed by that of collagen type ii , which was the second most adhesive ecm at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml. although the a <dig> values of collagen type iv and laminin were lower than those of collagen type i and type ii, rpnxiiia was confirmed to bind to both ecms at higher concentrations . these results indicate that rpnxiiia can bind to rodent ecms.

when compared with the domains in the hmm database, several pnxiiia domains have large repeat sequences that contain the hemagglutinin repeat in the primary sequence. rpnxiiia was subjected to a hemagglutination assay with washed sheep erythrocytes. figure 3e shows the results of the hemagglutination assay with rpnxiiia. hemagglutination of sheep erythrocytes was observed at rpnxiiia concentrations exceeding  <dig>  μg/ml, indicating that rpnxiiia participates in the hemagglutination of sheep erythrocytes.

we also measured the hemoglobin released from the sheep erythrocytes when they were cultured with rpnxiiia; however, rpnxiiia did not exhibit typical hemolytic activity, indicating that rpnxiiia is less involved in hemolysis.

characterization of deletion mutants of rpnxiiia variants
to clarify the role of large repeat sequences in the functions of pnxiiia, we generated soluble rpnxiiia and deletion mutants of rpnxiiia variants. rpnxiiia, rpnxiiia <dig>  rpnxiiia <dig>  and rpnxiiia <dig> essentially contained  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda, and  <dig> kda of the parent pnxiiia, respectively .

to compare the binding ability of the rpnxiiia variants, we performed binding assays with collagen type i coated on the 96-well plate when  <dig> μg/ml of the rpnxiiia variants were applied. the a <dig> of wild-type rpnxiiia was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for that of rpnxiiia <dig>  rpnxiiia <dig>  and rpnxiiia <dig>  respectively . almost all a620s of the deletion mutant proteins were lower than that of the parent rpnxiiia. these results indicate that rpnxiiia can bind to ecms and that its lack of repeat sequences reduces its ability to bind ecms.

we subjected the rpnxiiia variants to a hemagglutination assay with washed sheep erythrocytes. although the deletion mutant protein rpnxiii <dig> promoted hemagglutination at the same concentration as that of rpnxiiia, more than  <dig> μg/ml of both rpnxiiia <dig> and rpnxiiia <dig> were required for hemagglutination . although exact differentiation among the rpnxiiia variants was not observed in hemagglutination, these results indicate that rpnxiiia plays a role in hemagglutination and that the repeat sequences located in the c-terminal portion are necessary for enhanced hemagglutination.

localization and interaction of pnxiiia
ability of adherence, hemagglutination, and cytotoxicity in reference strains
initially, we performed southern blotting analysis for detecting partial sequences of pnxiiia. only genomic dna from p. pneumotropica ccug  <dig> was confirmed to include the partial gene containing the rtx repeat ; however, numerous signals including putative unspecific signals appeared using the probes targeting the gene encoding n-terminal portion of pnxiiia. these results indicate that the gene encoding pnxiiia is heterogenic and diversified. subsequently, we performed western blotting analysis of total protein obtained from cultured cells with anti-rpnxiiia. although pnxiiia was detected in the  <dig> reference strains of p. pneumotropica by western blotting, the estimated size and intensity of the detected signals were varied among the strains . in brief, the molecular weight of the detected signals obtained from atcc  <dig> and ccug  <dig> was approximately  <dig> kda, whereas those obtained from ccug  <dig> and ccug  <dig> were less than  <dig> kda. furthermore, the signals from both atcc  <dig> and ccug  <dig> had higher intensity than those of the other reference strains. the a <dig> values determined by whole-cell binding assays with the collagen type i of the pnxiiia-producing strains were significantly higher than that of ccug  <dig>  which was not confirmed to produce pnxiiia . hemagglutination activity was clearly observed in the  <dig> reference strains, whereas ccug  <dig> exhibits insignificant activity . although the existence of pnxiiia was confirmed to participate in the activity of adherence and hemagglutination, these activities may be varied among the strains. furthermore, the cytotoxicity of reference strains toward j774a. <dig> cells was examined . strains atcc  <dig>  atcc  <dig>  and ccug  <dig> exhibited more than 70% cytotoxicity; the other strains exhibited less than 50% cytotoxicity. although the cytotoxicity of each strain did not absolutely coincide with those of the strains that produce pnxiiia, strain ccug  <dig>  which was not confirmed to produce pnxiiia, was demonstrated to be less cytotoxic toward j774a. <dig> cells. these results also indicate that rodent isolates were found to have binding and hemagglutination activities; on the other hand, p. pneumotropica ccug  <dig>  which was recorded to be isolated from birds, was not confirmed to have these activities .

discussion
in this study, we identified and characterized a third gene that encodes an rtx exoprotein in p. pneumotropica. a known protein that is similar to pnxiiia is the rtx exoprotein, which was identified in a upec strain  <cit> . lloyd et al.  <cit>  reported that a mutant strain in which the gene encoding this rtx exoprotein was deleted colonized bladders and kidneys less efficiently than the wild-type upec strain. these results indicate that this rtx toxin may participate in bacterial colonization. to characterize the virulence properties of pnxiiia, we focused on its adhesion and hemagglutination activities as well as its cytotoxicity. for instance, 100- <dig> ng/ml recombinant cyaa from bordetella pertussis lysed approximately 100% of murine monocytes over a 4-h period  <cit> . although the conditions were different, pnxiiia was assumed to be weakly cytotoxic compared to the rtx toxin, which is highly toxic.

several rtx toxins that act as leukotoxins reportedly bind to β2-integrin lfa- <dig>  on species-specific leukocytes  <cit> . lfa- <dig> is expressed on the cell surface as a glycoprotein composed of the α subunit of cd <dig> and the β subunit of cd <dig>  in the case of lkta produced by mannheimia haemolytica, which is the principal pathogen of bovine respiratory diseases complex, can bind to the bovine cd11a of lfa- <dig>  <cit> . ltxa produced by a. actinomycetemcomitans recognizes the β-propeller domain of human cd11a  <cit> . the cytotoxicity of rpnxiiia toward j774a. <dig> cells was successfully attenuated by the addition of anti-cd11a mab, which can react to mouse cd11a as a neutralizing antibody, suggesting that the α subunit of mouse lfa- <dig> may be required for its cytotoxicity toward j774a. <dig> cells. the detailed mechanisms underlying cd11a mediated pnxiiia cytolysis need to be clarified in future studies.

one of the features of this high-molecular-weight protein is that it has 2- <dig> different copies of  <dig> large repeat sequences. these copies, although not completely identical, are highly similar and contain several bacterial ig-like domains and a hemagglutination repeat. the deletion mutant proteins were observed to bind less to rodent ecms compared with the parent rpnxiiia. all  <dig> large repeat sequences contained regions that were partially similar to several groups of bacterial ig-like domains, including groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  many ig-like domains that belong to these groups are indicated to form an ig-like fold and are reportedly present in bacterial cell-surface proteins such as intimins and invasins  <cit> . the other groups of ig-like domains have also been suggested to form ig-like folds and play in a role in adhesion to host cells, contributing to pathogenicity  <cit> . in accordance with our experimental results, these sequences are indispensable for adherence to ecms, and thus, the  <dig> large repeat sequences in pnxiiia may be required for the pathogenicity of p. pneumotropica.

all rtx proteins in p. pneumotropica have only 3- <dig> rtx repeats and rtx-like sequences, and the numbers of the repeat sequence are fewer than those in the other highly toxic members of rtx toxin family  <cit> . for example, the toxicity of the b. pertussis rtx toxin cyaa is reportedly activated by the coexpression of its accessory protein acyltransferase cyac, leading to the binding of b. pertussis to eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in the  <dig> rtx toxins in p. pneumotropica, none of the predicted acylation protein-coding genes were found in neighboring genes, and the acylation site was also not found in the primary structure of the proteins, indicating that the rtx proteins identified in p. pneumotropica have a structure that is unique to the rtx toxin family. furthermore, the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of wild-type strain of p. pneumotropica were reportedly diversified with an increase in the number of isolates  <cit> . pnxiiia is also assumed to be heterogenic and diversified among the p. pneumotropica strains. it is necessary to further clarify the relationships between the diversity and the role of pnxiiia in p. pneumotropica infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified and characterized a third gene encoding the rtx exoprotein pnxiiia. the results indicated that rpnxiiia has cytotoxicity toward j774a. <dig> cells. our results also implicate that pnxiiia is localized on the cell surface and is related to adherence to the host ecms and hemagglutination.
