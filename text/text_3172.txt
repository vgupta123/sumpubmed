BACKGROUND
although genetic variation for protein content has been found in forage plants, this variability is narrower than that observed for other traits such as digestibility  <cit> . since the major protein components in monocot forage and silage crops are involved in metabolic activity, and hence are not "true" storage proteins, it has been argued that it is not feasible to make major changes in protein quality or protein composition by conventional breeding  <cit> . however, genetic engineering may allow improvement in protein quality and content through expression of a storage protein not found in grass vegetative tissue.

genes encoding seed storage proteins of various plant species have been transgenically expressed to test for improvement of nutritional quality. most experiments were conducted with tobacco and legume species including alfalfa, soybean, canola, clover and lupins. for nuclear-targeted genes, accumulation of these seed storage proteins in vegetative tissue of transgenic plants was either undetectable or very low. these included pea vicilin  <cit> , soybean conglycinin  <cit> , sunflower seed agglutinin  <cit> , and phaseolin  <cit> . the instability of seed proteins in non-seed tissues of transgenic plants was frequently attributed to protein targeting to protease-rich vacuoles in the vegetative cells, and subsequent degradation  <cit> .

the greatest accumulation of a seed storage protein from a nuclear-targeted gene was achieved using zeins, a maize seed storage protein that is targeted to "protein bodies" directly from the endoplasmic reticulum , thus avoiding the secretory route to the cellular vacuole. transgenic expression from the camv 35s promoter in tobacco resulted in the formation of these protein bodies containing the zein within vegetative tissues  <cit> . alternatively, "short-circuiting" the protein-targeting route by addition of an er retention signal to the storage-protein coding region also increased protein accumulation up to 100×  <cit> .

in many legumes, accumulation of specific vegetative storage proteins  in leaves and stems is the main source of increased nitrogen content  <cit> . use of vsps instead of seed storage proteins to increase vegetative protein content in monocots may provide an advantage since they have evolved to function in vegetative cell types. legume vegetative cells that accumulate vsp proteins contain multiple vacuole types and storage proteins are targeted to specific vacuoles where they are not rapidly degraded  <cit> , and do not interfere with cellular metabolic processes. it is uncertain if monocots can produce similar vacuoles or successfully target a vsp to them. the most studied vsps are the soybean vspα and vspβ proteins, which are lysine-rich glycosylated vacuolar proteins that accumulate abundantly in leaves, stems and pods, but not in seeds  <cit> . recently, soybean vspa and/or vspb genes fused to the 35s promoter were expressed in transgenic tobacco to study their accumulation in a heterologous dicot plant. nuclear targeted genes produced vsp ranging between  <dig> and 6% of the soluble protein in leaves of the transgenic plants  <cit> ; whereas, targeting to both the chloroplast and the vacuole within the same plant resulted in vsp comprising greater than 10% soluble protein  <cit> . soybean vsp is therefore an excellent candidate for use in transgenic improvement of plant protein status, particularly grasses that contain limited levels of lysine  <cit> . however, it remains to be determined if vsps can be expressed and accumulated in monocot plants since storage protein stability is dependent on post-translational events that may differ between monocots and eudicots. this manuscript presents the transgenic expression of soybean vspβ in the leaves of transgenic maize and discusses this expression in relation to the developmental stage of the plant.

RESULTS
development of primary  transgenic maize expressing vspb
out of  <dig> plants, twenty, belonging to five independent lines  were shown by southern blot analysis to contain a  <dig>  kb hybridizing band corresponding to the intact bar gene . all  <dig> plants also contained the expected  <dig>  kb band that hybridized to the vspb gene. the same probe detected two bands in ecori restricted soybean genomic dna, ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, corresponding to the highly homologous genes vspa and vspb  <cit> .

western blot analysis was used to detect the vspβ polypeptide in leaf extracts from fourteen primary  transgenic maize plants at vegetative stage . a distinct vspβ band was not visible in silver-stained sds-page separated maize extract proteins due to complexity of the total protein pattern and the relatively low level of vspβ expression . however, some of these plants expressed vspβ at a level high enough to be detected by western blot analysis . two plants  had the highest level of vspβ, while four plants  accumulated a lower level of vspβ. although a faint lower mw peptide band was visible in negative control maize extracts, vsp was clearly only present in transgenic lines. faint detection of bands in untransformed maize  is consistent with previous reports of cross-hybridizing of soybean vsp antibodies with proteins from monocots  <cit> . in soybean extracts used as a positive control, the antibody for vspβ recognized both vspα and vspβ polypeptides 

computer analysis of digital images of the western blots was used to detect differences in relative band intensity of the immunologically detected vspβ peptide. because the native soybean vsps  were easily visible on total protein stained gels , relative quantification of total stained proteins in the soybean samples indicated that the vsps represented about 10% of the total soluble protein in young soybean leaves. this is close to the previously reported value of  <dig> %  <cit> . the intensity of the transgenic maize 45-3- <dig> vspβ band on western blots was 44% of the soybean vsp's band . accounting for the differences in total protein applied to the gel , the vspβ protein was estimated to have accumulated to  <dig>  % of the total soluble protein. this is similar to the highest level of seed storage protein accumulation observed with the ectopic expression of zein  <cit> , but remains less than the 1% minimal expression level predicted by wandelt et al.  <cit>  to be needed to directly alter the nutritional quality of the leaves. although the  <dig> % of total soluble protein was too low to alter nutritional value, detection of vspβ in 45-3- <dig> allowed monitoring of vspβ level in leaves and stems during plant development.

presence of vspb in r <dig> plants
r <dig> plants were produced by back-crossing the r <dig> plants with hi ii control non-transformed pollen. back-crossing was performed because r <dig> plants directly regenerated from tissue culture did not have synchronized production of pollen and receptive female flowers. the r <dig> families segregating for bar expression were analyzed for the presence of the vspb gene by southern blot analysis. from  <dig> r <dig> plants analyzed, southern blot analysis showed that  <dig>  contained the vspb gene integrated into the genome. figure  <dig> shows examples for several r <dig> from five r <dig> parental lines. the ~ <dig>  kb vspb band can be seen in nine of the  <dig> r <dig> lines. there are also fainter bands one slightly larger than the  <dig>  kb band and one or two migrating between  <dig> and  <dig> kb. these are often observed as incomplete restriction of all eco ri sites internal to plasmid dna that is integrated into the maize genome. similar bands are observed even with the plasmid control.

total rna was isolated from leaves of young r <dig> plants at the vegetative stage . eighteen transgenic r <dig> plants, including the ones originating from r <dig> plants representing different levels of vspβ accumulation , were analyzed for vspb transcripts. because of high sequence similarity  between vspa and vspb cdnas, the same probe hybridized in soybean with both mrnas as demonstrated by staswick  <cit> . the transgenic plants 71-1-53a, 71-1-20a, 71-1-20e, and 71-1-20i produced a hybridizing band of approximately the expected size of  <dig>  kb indicating transgene expression ; however, most did not. use of the ubi- <dig> promoter for both the vspb and bar gene probably led to a high number of transgenics with the vspb silenced, and a higher level of vspβ accumulation will likely result in future work using a combination of different promoters.

immunodetection of vspβ protein in transgenic young plant leaves showed variation in accumulation in comparisons between the parental  and their r <dig> progeny, with the greatest variation observed with the highest vspβ expressing r <dig> plants . the parental line 71-1- <dig> had a relatively high level of expression of vspβ, but the only transgenic offspring from this line, 71-1-53a, had almost undetectable vspβ; in contrast, a low level accumulator, 71-1- <dig>  produced r <dig> lines expressing different levels of vspβ, although none of them expressed at higher levels than the parent. quantification of the relative level of vspβ expressed in the r <dig> leaves showed that the highest level measured was only  <dig> % of total soluble protein.

despite the overall low level of vspβ expression, for the purposes of this work, vspβ accumulation in several of the plants was high enough to study the relationship of plant developmental stage and vspb/vspβ accumulation. both the transcript abundance and vspβ protein accumulation were determined in the r <dig> lines using real-time quantitative rt-pcr and western blot immunodetection, respectively. real-time rt-pcr is more sensitive that northern blot analysis and was able to detect transcripts that were not seen with standard total rna blotting methods. the vspb transcript was quantified in leaves from immature plants  and silage stage plants , as well as, stems from the silage stage plants, . the vspb transcript was detected in all five transgenics . the relative level of rna among the different plant samples was not consistent across the different lines with some having more transcripts in the young leaves while others had more in the older leaves and stems.

when vspb rna abundance was compared to vspβ protein accumulation there was no correlation between the two . antiserum to vspβ detected vspβ only in leaves from young maize plants that had not yet flowered. no vspβ was detected in leaves and stems of silage stage corn that had developing seed. the soybean vspβ peptide was the primary band reacting with the antivspβ antiserum in young leaves of transgenic maize, however, in silage stage stems and to a lesser extent the silage stage leaves, there were multiple bands detected at a different size than the vspβ. these were also detected in the non-transgenic control plant samples and therefore, were not due to different modifications of the soybean vspβ. although the vspβ protein dropped below detectable levels in the silage stage 71-1-20a, 45-3-1f and 45-3-1-g plants, the vspβ transcript was still detectable. in fact, in the 71-1-20a plants the transcript level was highest in the silage stage leaves that had no detectable vspβ. therefore, post-transcriptional events  were altered in the silage stage leaves and stems as compared to the leaves of immature plants.

CONCLUSIONS
the vspb gene was successfully introduced into r <dig> regenerated maize and transferred to the r <dig> progeny, of which vspb transcript and vspβ protein were detected and studied. this is the first report on introduction and expression of a legume vegetative storage protein in a monocot plant. the inability to detect vspβ from the maize vegetative tissue at the time of seed development, even when the vspb transcript was still expressed, must have arisen from either reduced translational efficiency of the vspb transcript or a decrease in the stability of the vspβ protein. the reduction of seed storage protein level in leaves of transgenic eudicots was also observed with expression of vicillin in alfalfa  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> ; however, it was not observed with the expression of vspα in tobacco  <cit>  or ovalbumin in alfalfa  <cit> . these data suggest that factors controlling developmental change in vegetative tissue protein accumulation are a combination of host plant traits and innate characteristics of the ectopically expressed protein. it is interesting to speculate that if, in maize , soybean vspβ was degraded in a manner that provided amino acids that were translocated to the seed to support seed development, then development of high level vsp expressing monocots may be a way to improve nitrogen content of the seed/grain produced by the plant.
