BACKGROUND
dna replication is an essential process and is generally conserved across all three domains of life, making use of two different dna replication apparatuses 
 <cit> . dna replication initiates from a single origin in bacteria, whereas multiple origins are utilized in eukaryotes
 <cit> . the study of replication origins in archaea has been ongoing for more than a decade, and multiple replication origins have been identified in several archaeal species
 <cit> . it is not yet understood, however, why archaea adopt multiple origins to initiate replication of their bacterial-like chromosomes or how these multiple replication origins evolved. notably, answering these questions may also provide insight into the mechanisms of the more complex replication origins found in eukaryotes.

our current knowledge of archaeal replication origins comes from a few model strains, including pyrococcus abyssi 
 <cit> , sulfolobus spp. 
 <cit> , and two halophilic archaea , haloferax volcanii <cit>  and halobacterium sp. strain nrc-1
 <cit> . a single origin was mapped near the only orc <dig> gene in the genome of p. abyssi via a combination of in silico <cit>  and biochemical
 <cit>  analyses. three origins were mapped in sulfolobus solfataricus and sulfolobus acidocaldarius by means of microarray-based marker frequency analysis 
 <cit> , and two origins adjacent to the orc/cdc <dig> genes were previously identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
 <cit> . on the chromosome of halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  one origin was verified with autonomous replication activity
 <cit> , and four were mapped using whole-genome mfa, with three origins located in the vicinity of orc/cdc <dig> genes
 <cit> . in h. volcanii, five replication origins were identified, two within the chromosome and one each within the three megaplasmids phv <dig>  phv <dig> and phv4
 <cit> .

these experimental data revealed that the basic structure of replication origins is conserved among archaea, normally containing an at-rich unwinding element and several conserved repeats 
 <cit> . the orb elements were proven to be the recognition sites for the orc/cdc <dig> initiation protein via biochemical
 <cit>  and structural approaches
 <cit> . in addition, distinct from the orbs identified in the oric <dig> of s. solfataricus <cit> , a halophile-specific “g-string”  was observed in all origins from h. volcanii <cit> . whereas the cdc <dig> and the orc complex proteins  act together to recruit the mcm  complex to an origin of replication in eukaryotes
 <cit> , a subset of initiator proteins , which are related to both orc <dig> and cdc <dig> of eukaryotes, were adopted by archaea. therefore, archaeal orc/cdc <dig> is considered to possess both origin recognition and mcm-loading activities
 <cit> . previous studies in s. solfataricus revealed that origin identity was determined by the specific recognition of orc/cdc <dig> proteins
 <cit> . interestingly, the multiple origins, especially the orb sequences and their associated orc/cdc <dig> proteins, are quite diverse in all three experimentally characterized archaea 
 <cit> , indicating independent evolutionary history. in particular, an origin comparison between two hyperthermophilic archaeal genera, aeropyrum and sulfolobus, suggests that the capture of extrachromosomal elements accounts for replicon evolution
 <cit> . however, as the study of replication origins has been limited to only a few archaeal species, it is still difficult to determine the evolutionary relationship of multiple replication origins within archaea.

haloarchaeal genomes are normally composed of multiple replicons  with multiple orc/cdc <dig> homologs 
 <cit> , indicating that the occurrence of multiple replication origins is widespread in haloarchaea. to date, however, studies have been limited to two model haloarchaea, h. volcanii <cit>  and halobacterium sp. nrc-1
 <cit> . there is not enough information to understand the diversity and evolution of multiple replication origins in this distinct group of archaea. in this work, which is based on both previous experimental data and the identification of replication origins in haloarcula hispanica, a haloarchaeon that was recently sequenced in our laboratory
 <cit> , we performed a comparative analysis of predicted orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in  <dig> completely sequenced haloarchaeal genomes. these comparative analyses indicated that the introduction of novel replication origins usually accompanied the acquisition of new genomic content by insertions into a chromosome or the reconstruction of novel extrachromosomal replicons, which may be linked to an adaptive mechanism of haloarchaea to diverse environments, similar to salinibacter ruber <cit> . in particular, various families of orc/cdc6-associated replication origins were identified, and different evolutionary mechanisms, including ancestral preservation, translocation among haloarchaea and likely differential loss, were proposed to account for the current multiple origins of replication in the haloarchaeal genomes.

RESULTS
identification of orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in h. hispanica
research in archaeal model strains indicates that most replication origins share conserved characteristics, such as the presence of inverted orb elements and being located directly adjacent to orc/cdc <dig> genes
 <cit> . in addition, a “g-string” at the end of orb elements was observed in all identified origins from h. volcanii <cit> . these common features provided us a reference standard to predict replication origins in h. hispanica. briefly, only those intergenic regions  that contain orb-like elements and are directly adjacent to orc/cdc <dig> genes were considered to be putative orc/cdc6-associated replication origins. necessarily, although they were not included in the scope of this study, we do not exclude the possibility of replication origins that are not directly adjacent to orc/cdc <dig> genes or are without classical orb-like elements. replication origins with these characteristics were shown to exist in sulfolobus spp.
 <cit>  and may exist in halobacterium sp. nrc-1
 <cit> ; however, to our knowledge, they constitute only a small proportion of the replication origins in archaea and are not easily predicted with current information.

to identify replication origins in h. hispanica, the irs around the orc/cdc <dig> genes were examined for the presence of orb elements. h. hispanica encodes eleven orc/cdc <dig> genes, with six copies  in the main chromosome, four  in the minichromosome and only one  in the megaplasmid. orb repeats harboring a g-rich motif were observed adjacent to eight orc/cdc <dig> genes , in agreement with the halophile-specific “g-string” elements found in h. volcanii <cit> . however, in contrast to other characterized archaeal origins with at least two orb repeats flanking an at-rich unwinding element, only one orb-like element was observed in each ir flanking the cdc6d gene, which was considered to be a deficient origin  when examined by hand . accordingly, seven replication origins were predicted in h. hispanica: two were in the main chromosome , four were in the minichromosome , and one was in the megaplasmid  .

to confirm these putative replication origins, we performed a genetic assay to test their autonomous replication activities. as a control, we also examined whether oric3-cdc6d* and irs around cdc6b, cdc6c and cdc6f, where no orbs were detected, could engage in origin activities. dna fragments, including the orc/cdc <dig> genes plus their flanking irs, were cloned into a nonreplicating plasmid, pbi101
 <cit> , to assay for the presence of an autonomously replicating sequence  . of the eleven orc/cdc <dig> genes with adjacent irs, oric1cdc6a and oric2cdc6e in the main chromosome, oric6cdc6i and oric7cdc6j in the minichromosome and orip-cdc6k in the megaplasmid were able to confer replication ability to the non-replicating plasmid , which was indicative of the ars activities of these origins. as expected, no replicating ability was observed for plasmids constructed with oric3-cdc6d* or with the fragments containing cdc6b, cdc6c and cdc6f . although the remaining two predicted replication origins, oric4-cdc6g and oric5-cdc6h, shared a conserved structure with characteristic archaeal origin , they could not drive the autonomous replication activities under our experimental conditions, which is reminiscent of the dormant origins found in eukaryotes
 <cit> . dormant replication origins are normally inactive, but they can be activated for cellular response to replicative stress
 <cit> . in the future, it would be interesting to further analyze the utilization of these likely dormant replication origins in h. hispanica.

most orc/cdc <dig> genes are predicted to associate with replication origins in haloarchaea
to date, the genomes of  <dig> haloarchaea have been made available through ncbi , and  <dig> of these  <dig> genomes include the minichromosomes and/or megaplasmids, which provided us the opportunity to perform a comparative genomic analysis of replication origins in haloarchaea. to focus on the orc/cdc6-associated replication origins, we first conducted an exhaustive search of the orc/cdc <dig> genes in the  <dig> sequenced haloarchaeal genomes .

halalkalicoccus jeotgali b3
 <dig> haloarchaeal genomes and their genbank accession numbers.  <dig> number of annotated orc/cdc <dig> proteins; only those greater than  <dig> amino acids are included.  <dig> number of orc/cdc <dig> proteins associated with predicted replication origins.  <dig> percentage of predicted origin-associated orc/cdc <dig> proteins.  <dig> the chromosomes of halobacterium salinarum r <dig> are almost identical to those of halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  showing overlapped predicted replication origins of three origins in the chromosome and one each origin in phs <dig> and phs <dig>   <dig> origins were experimentally mapped in these haloarchaea. * rep genes encoded in these replicons might be responsible for dna replication initiation. # both orc/cdc <dig> and rep genes are absent in these replicons. a gene  in phv <dig> of h. volcanii shows low homology with the reph gene.

multiple orc/cdc <dig> homologs are encoded in each of the  <dig> sequenced haloarchaeal genomes. based on a previous study
 <cit> , origin-associated orc/cdc <dig> proteins contain two important domains, a n-terminal aaa + domain and a c-terminal winged-helix domain, and almost all have a length greater than  <dig> amino acids. a total of  <dig> orc/cdc <dig> homologs fulfilling these criteria were collected from the  <dig> sequenced haloarchaeal genomes , and the irs flanking these orc/cdc <dig> genes were collected for motif searching. interestingly, distinct orb-like elements harboring g-string were found in the irs flanking nearly two-thirds  of the orc/cdc <dig> genes , and the predicted replication origins were rechecked manually to remove deficient origins such as oric3-cdc6d* in h. hispanica. as expected, multiple replication origins were predicted in all of the analyzed haloarchaeal genomes . haloterrigena turkmenica has the greatest number of predicted origins at  <dig>  and  <dig> of those origins are located on its chromosome . on average, within the haloarchaeal chromosomes, more than half of the orc/cdc <dig> genes have predicted origins nearby: a maximum of 75%  in halobacterium spp. and a minimum of 33%  in halomicrobium mukohataei . compared with the chromosome, the overwhelming majority  of the orc/cdc <dig> genes in the extrachromosomal elements  are associated with predicted replication origins .

as several replication origins have been experimentally mapped in h. hispanica , h. volcanii <cit>  and halobacterium sp. nrc-1
 <cit> , these experimental data were used to evaluate the efficiency of the origin prediction performed in this study. in h. hispanica, five out of the seven predicted replication origins were confirmed to have ars activity. for the replication origins in the chromosome of halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  a high consistency between our predicted results and the whole-genome mfa
 <cit> , except for one uncertain origin , proves the efficiency of the bioinformatic approach in this study. for h. volcanii, in addition to the five replication origins that were previously genetically mapped
 <cit> , five additional replication origins were also predicted in this study. as discussed above, these additional predicted origins might be weak or dormant replication origins, which are not easily identified by experimental approaches.

in summary, our bioinformatic approach not only is important for identifying active replication origins in haloarchaea but also provides novel information for predicting likely dormant replication origins, which is also important for the future study of replication regulation and adaptation in archaea.

diversity of orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in haloarchaea
a recent report suggested that orc/cdc <dig> initiators specifically determine origin discrimination in archaea
 <cit> . to investigate this further, a phylogenetic analysis of ori-associated orc/cdc <dig> proteins in haloarchaea was performed, and the resulting tree showed that orc/cdc <dig> homologs cluster into different families , which suggested that various orc/cdc6-associated replication origins have been adopted in haloarchaea. different orc/cdc <dig> families have been suggested in previous work
 <cit> ; herein, we focused on the putative origin-associated orc/cdc <dig> homologs with the intention of providing a detailed classification of predicted replication origins. although setting precise boundaries was difficult, the predicted replication origins could be sorted into distinct families based on a combination of the phylogenetic tree of the orc/cdc <dig> homologs  and a comparison of orb sequences . it is noteworthy that blast analyses confirmed that only those orc/cdc <dig> homologs showing high identities  were grouped into the same family in this study. specifically, the origins adjacent to the specific orc/cdc <dig> conserved among all haloarchaea were named oric <dig>  as previously reported
 <cit> , and two other families with the top two members were selected and named orica and oricb to facilitate additional evolutionary analyses . this classification of replication origins will become more complete when more haloarchaeal genomes become available and will aid in the understanding of replication origins in novel haloarchaea.

notably, orc/cdc <dig> proteins associated with oric <dig> not only are conserved in all haloarchaeal genomes but were also identified in other archaeal genomes . for instance, cdc6- <dig> in s. solfataricus was experimentally proven to recognize the orb elements of oric <dig> in halobacterium sp. nrc-1
 <cit> . thus, we suggest that this conserved origin  might be present in an archaea ancestor and maintained in different lineages during the evolutionary history of archaea. by contrast, other orc/cdc <dig> homologs from different haloarchaeal genomes could be clustered into several distinct families , indicating that these origins are shared by different haloarchaea. as different orc/cdc <dig> proteins from the same haloarchaeal genome are normally distributed into different families , the results suggested that multiple origins within a haloarchaeon were unlikely to arise from internal duplications.

to further characterize these predicted origins in haloarchaea, orb sequences were extracted from all of the putative origins  for comparison analysis . the results revealed the linkage-specificity of orc/cdc <dig> homologs and the corresponding orb elements,  . these observations suggested that orc/cdc <dig> proteins specifically recognize adjacent orb elements, consistent with a recent report about origin discrimination by orc/cdc <dig> initiators
 <cit> .

notably, the structures of origins from even the same family are also diverse in haloarchaea. although the predicted replication origins are primarily located directly upstream of orc/cdc <dig> genes, as previously observed
 <cit> , there are a few exceptions  in which orb elements are located in irs downstream of the orc/cdc <dig> gene  . in addition, in some predicted replication origins, orb elements are occasionally observed in both irs flanking the orc/cdc <dig> gene, such as those flanking cdc6e in h. hispanica, cdc6h, cdc6g and cdc6m in h. marismortui, orc <dig> and orc <dig> in halobacterium species, orc <dig> in h. volcanii and hlac_ <dig>  hlac_ <dig> and hlac_ <dig> in h. lacusprofundi . interestingly, although a previous genetic experiment found that the predicted origin proximal to nrc-1_orc <dig> is not able to promote efficient autonomous replication
 <cit> , this origin, in combination with the origin proximal to nrc-1_orc <dig>  was experimentally proven to be active in halobacterium sp. strain nrc- <dig> by whole-genome mfa
 <cit> . the origin proximal to orc <dig> in halobacterium species has a different structure comparing to others in the orica family , suggesting that structurally diverse origins function in different haloarchaea.

surprisingly, two different orb-like elements were found in the irs proximal to one orc/cdc <dig> gene, in either the megaplasmid of h. lacusprofundi  or the main chromosome of h. walsbyi  . one orb-like element, taacagcggaaacagtggggtgggggggt, is shared by these two different origins, while the other shows no similarity .

taken together, the multiple replication origins in haloarchaea are dramatically diverse. in addition to the diversity of the orb elements and corresponding orc/cdc <dig> genes, the number and position of orb elements also contributes to the diversity of the origins in haloarchaea. this diversity may facilitate the differential utilization of multiple replication origins in haloarchaea. strikingly, the origin proximal to orc <dig> in halobacterium species was active in vivo <cit> , while its conserved origin  proximal to orc <dig> in h. volcanii was not proven functional
 <cit> . as the two origins exhibit different structures and these two haloarchaea grow in different environmental conditions, these observations may provide novel insight into differential utilization of replication origins in haloarchaea.

novel replication origins accompany newly acquired genomic content
as described above, the replication origins of two haloarcula species, h. hispanica and h. marismortui were predicted, and their ars activities were also examined in h. hispanica . although their chromosomes show a high degree of conservation , the two species harbor several different replication origins . thus, an in-depth study of these origins would be helpful in understanding the processes involved in the diversity of haloarchaeal replication origins.

with the exception of the two shared replication origins, oric1cdc6a and oric2-cdc6e in h. hispanica and the corresponding oric1-cdc6d and oric2-cdc6h in h. marismortui, there are one or two other predicted origins specific to each strain: oric3-cdc6d* in h. hispanica, oric3-cdc6i and oric4-cdc6g in h. marismortui . the two shared origins, oric <dig> and oric <dig>  were likely present in the ancestor of haloarcula, and their specific origins, oric3cdc6d* in h. hispanica and oric3cdc6i and oric4cdc6g in h. marismortui, may have been acquired later through translocation processes following the divergence of these species. an alternative hypothesis is that all three species-specific origins were also present in the ancestor of haloarcula but were lost differently in h. hispanica and h. marismortui. however, these three predicted origins  are located in two divergent regions  with significant g + c content variations , which is indicative of newly acquired genomic content specific to each of the two strains
 <cit> . thus, the most likely explanation is that these predicted species-specific origins were newly acquired as a part of new genomic content . this hypothesis is reinforced by the abundance of transposases observed around these specific origins .

concentrating on the genes with annotated functions, except for those predicted to be transposases, the majority of genes within the two divergent regions were found to be involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis . subsequently, a blast analysis against the ncbi non-redundant proteins database was performed on all of the genes in regions a and b in both chromosomes . the genes were conserved across several different organisms ; most were similar to other haloarchaeal homologs, but for several genes, their closest homologs were outside of haloarchaea. the two linked glycosyltransferase genes in region a of h. hispanica were most similar to those found in methanobacterium . several genes in region b of both chromosomes showed the greatest similarity to genes found in bacteria, especially a cluster in region b of h. hispanica . in addition, those genes found in clusters in the two haloarcula species were also usually found in clusters in other organisms , suggesting that these genes were acquired in clusters.

a previous report in salinibacter ruber suggested that genes with related functions but different origins might have been assembled together and introduced concurrently into the genome of s. rubber <cit> . similarly, our comparative analyses indicated that the convergence of closely related functional genes from different sources is an important way through which new genomic content is acquired in haloarchaea and that foreign replication origins are usually introduced as a component of this new content. we cannot be certain whether the new genomic content  is introduced with single or multiple transfer, as the mechanism is not well understood; however, our analyses strongly suggested that the novel replication origins may be important for the acquisition of new genomic content and that the newly acquired genes from the surroundings may be favorable for the haloarchaeal cells to improve their ability to adapt to changeable environments.

recruitment of novel replication origins in the reconstruction of the extrachromosomal replicons
the haloarchaeal genomes in this study, except that of halorhabdus utahensis, generally harbor extrachromosomal replicon, ranging in number from one in h. mukohataei and h. walsbyi to eight in h. marismortui . in addition, orc/cdc <dig> genes were found on most of the extrachromosomal elements , suggesting that the orc/cdc6-associated replication origins are responsible for replication initiation on most of these replicons. therefore, an in-depth analysis could further elucidate the evolution of these replication origins.

compared to h. hispanica, the h. marismortui genome contains a greater number of extrachromosomal replicons, with eight , while h. hispanica contains only two . among these minireplicons, only megaplasmids phh <dig> and png <dig> are collinear , suggesting that they may have been present in a common ancestor of the two haloarcula species. the lengths of the minichromosomes of h. marismortui and h. hispanica are 288 kb and 488 kb, respectively. they share homology over approximately 100 kb, with a few inversions and gaps , indicating that this region was likely rearranged in the two haloarcula species and thus that the two minichromosomes are only distantly related. in addition, the megaplasmids from png <dig> to png <dig> are unique to h. marismortui. however, pairs of orthologous to the minichromosome of h. hispanica are observed, especially in png <dig>  with orthologs as large as 30 kb . together with the abundant ish  elements encoded in these replicons, our data imply that the extrachromosomal replicons were significantly rearranged after the divergence of the two species and that new dna contents were acquired from surrounding organisms. these results are also reminiscent of previous reports on the evolution of the large dynamic replicons found in halobacterium spp.
 <cit> .

to understand the different composition of the extrachromosomal elements in the two haloarcula species, the orc/cdc6-associated replication origins in these minireplicons were also examined. in h. hispanica, four predicted orc/cdc6-associated replication origins are distributed in the minichromosome, and one is present in the megaplasmid phh <dig>  the two origins  in the minichromosome and the one  in phh <dig> were confirmed by ars activity . in h. marismortui, the predicted orc/cdc6-associated replication origins are distributed among the extrachromosomal replicons as follows: two in the minichromosome, one in png <dig>  one in png <dig>  two in png <dig> and one in png <dig> . no orc/cdc <dig> genes are encoded by either png <dig> or png <dig>  and no candidate replication origin was identified adjacent to the orc/cdc <dig> gene in png <dig>  indicating that other types of replication origins are involved in the initiation of replication in these replicons. this concept is reinforced by the identification of rep genes in these replicons 
 <cit> . among these replication origins, only two are shared by the two haloarcula species, orip-cdc6k in phh <dig> and the origin  in png <dig>  as well as the origin proximal to cdc6g and cdc6a in the minichromosomes of h. hispanica and h. marismortui, respectively . in contrast to the high conservation found in the megaplasmids phh <dig> and png <dig>  the region around cdc6g and cdc6a shows no collinearity , strongly suggesting that this origin might not have been present in their ancestor and instead was employed by h. hispanica and h. marismortui after their divergence. surprisingly, a specific origin  in the minichromosome of h. hispanica, which proved functional , was located in the region with high orthology to h. marismortui . this observation suggested that this replication origin was recruited into this region in h. hispanica or was lost in h. marismortui during rearrangement of minichromosomes in the two haloarcula species. similarly, the specific origins in png <dig>  png <dig> and png <dig> and the rep-associated origins in png <dig>  png <dig> and png <dig> were all likely recruited to accomplish the construction of these replicons in h. marismortui.

multiple evolutionary mechanisms account for multiple orc/cdc6-associated origins in haloarchaea
our above analysis clearly indicated that the replication origins in haloarchaea are quite diverse and that different haloarchaea can share a few different origins. although we cannot exclude the possibility that origin loss contributes to mosaic replication origins in haloarchaea, it is unlikely that all of the origins currently shared by different haloarchaea were present in the ancestor of each genus of halobacteriaceae as oric <dig>  archaea species often harbor mobile elements within their genome, which are mobilized via integrases
 <cit>  or transposases encoded by insertion sequence  elements
 <cit> . our comparative analyses of the genomic context of the replication origins in the two haloarcula species demonstrated the presence of mobile elements near their specific origins . these indicators of translocation processes were further analyzed in the genomes proximal to the origins in other haloarchaea. forty-two of  <dig> potential replication origins have integrases or transposases nearby , which might contribute to accelerate the translocation of these origins. in haloarchaeal chromosomes, the ratios of later-acquired origins are comparatively low, with a maximum of 50% for h. marismortui, h. utahensis and h. walsbyi and none in h. borinquense, h. jeotgali b <dig>  h. mukohataei, h. xanaduensis and n. pharaonis . by comparison, these later-acquired replication origins are widespread in extrachromosomal elements. for example, they account for 80% , 83%  and  <dig> %  of the replication origins in the extrachromosomal elements of h. salinarum r <dig>  h. volcanii ds <dig> and h. lacusprofundi, respectively . these observations suggest that a portion of the replication origins in haloarchaea, especially those in extrachromosomal elements, were introduced through recent translocation processes.

* origins with indicators of translocation processes, integrases or transposases, etc., are predicted to be later-acquired. the number in parentheses is the number of replication origins in the extrachromosomal elements.

contrary to the complete conservation of the replication origin oric <dig> <cit> , the other origins are distributed almost randomly among haloarchaea, within both the chromosome and extrachromosomal elements . to better understand the evolutionary history of these replication origins in haloarchaea, two distinct origin families , with the top two members excluding oric <dig> in this study, were selected for further comparative analyses. interestingly, while the genes around oric <dig> are highly syntenic
 <cit> , the genomic context around orica reveals no similarity among the different haloarchaeal genomes . these observations indicated that the origins belonging to this family had different evolutionary processes from those in the oric <dig> family. furthermore, transposases were observed near the origin in five out of eight genomes halobacterium species , h. marismortui , h. jeotgali , and h. lacusprofundi ] . these results suggested that these replication origins were likely mobilized via transposases, implying that association with transposases might result in an acceleration of translocation rates of orica among haloarchaea. additionally, this acceleration may account for the random distribution of this origin family among different haloarchaea.

when focusing on the origins of the oricb family, two different types were observed. one type consists of origins proximal to hvo_orc <dig> in h. volcanii, hbo_ <dig> in h. borinquense and hla_ <dig> in h. lacusprofundi. some homologs were detected adjacent to this type of origin in all of the three genomes, showing that this type of origin directly links to a syntenic rrna region containing the 16s rrna, ala-trna, 23s rrna and 5s rrna genes . in conjunction with the clustering in the 16s rrna tree, this finding strongly suggests that these three haloarchaea shared their closest ancestor and that oricb might be present in their ancestor. notably, the two functional replication origins in the chromosome of h. volcanii were observed close to the two rrna operons
 <cit> . this closeness might benefit the preservation of origins over evolutionary time. another type of origin in the oricb family, including the origins proximal to htu_ <dig> in h. turkmenica, hje_ <dig> in h. jeotgali, nma_ <dig> in n. magadii and hxa_ <dig> in h. xanaduensis, was observed; this origin showed no similarity with respect to the order of the genes flanking the origin in different genomes . this finding implies a totally distinct evolutionary process. as three out of the four members of this type of origin were identified in extrachromosomal elements, it is plausible to propose that these origins were recruited for the construction of novel extrachromosomal replicons independently. gene pools in environments were proposed to explain the adaption of prokaryotes under changeable environments
 <cit> . similarly, the diversity of replication origins can be thought of as a pool of origins in environments that can be recruited for the construction of novel replicons. this hypothesis sheds light on not only the random distribution of conserved origins in different haloarchaea but also the presence of extremely variable extrachromosomal replicons in haloarchaea.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, orc/cdc6-associated replication origins were predicted in  <dig> sequenced haloarchaeal genomes through orc/cdc <dig> protein analyses and adjacent orb searching. multiple replication origins were found in all of the analyzed genomes, and nearly two-thirds of the orc/cdc <dig> genes were found to be associated with the predicted replication origins. we also experimentally investigated the predicted replication origins in h. hispanica and demonstrated that  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted origins possess ars activity and that the remaining  <dig> putative replication origins appear to be dormant in experimental conditions. in conjunction with orb comparisons and phylogenetic analysis of the orc/cdc <dig> homologs, various families of these predicted replication origins were revealed in haloarchaea. the diversity of multiple replication origins in haloarchaea was mainly driven by the diversity of orc/cdc <dig> proteins that specifically associate with distinct orb elements. interestingly, origins within the same family may have different functions among the various haloarchaea, e.g., although belonging to the orica family, the active origin in halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> 
 <cit>  was not proven functional in h. volcanii 
 <cit> . these observations suggested differential origin utilization under different replicative conditions and demonstrated the advantage of our bioinformatic approaches in the identification of dormant or weak replication origins in haloarchaea.

phylogenetic analysis of orc/cdc <dig> proteins suggested that multiple replication origins in haloarchaeal genomes can be categorized into at least two types: oric <dig>  which is present in an ancestor of archaea, and the other origins, which are likely specific in haloarchaea. we also revealed that transposases or integrases flank more than 40% of predicted replication origins; this flanking is indicative of the translocation of a portion of the replication origins among haloarchaea. in conjunction with comparative analyses of two families of replication origins , we suggested that different evolutionary mechanisms account for the diversity of replication origins in haloarchaea: preservation from ancestors , differential loss, and translocation among haloarchaea. in particular, a comparative genomic analysis of two haloarcula species revealed that species-specific origins in the main chromosome were introduced along with new genes, whereas in the extrachromosomal replicons, the recruitment of novel replication origins usually accompanied the construction and/or rearrangement of minireplicons. the concept of an “origins pool” was proposed, and the introduction of novel origins in conjunction with the acquisition of new genomic content may be linked to the mechanisms involved in the adaptation of haloarchaeal cells to changeable environments. taken together, our analyses of the diversity and evolution of the potential replication origins in haloarchaea may open avenues to understanding the significance of the multiple replication origins in the domain of archaea.
