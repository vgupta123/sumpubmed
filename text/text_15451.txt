BACKGROUND
intramammary infection induces a fast influx of blood neutrophils into the site of infection  <cit> . activated neutrophils eliminate invading pathogens by phagocytosis and a diverse array of oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent killing mechanisms. a powerful mechanism is the generation of reactive oxygen species  or superoxide  <cit> . it is widely accepted that neutrophils play a pivotal role in mammary gland immunity. since  <dig>  an overwhelming amount of evidence has been generated of neutrophil dysfunction around parturition and early lactation with consequences on the defense of the mammary gland  <cit> . for example, although e.coli strains may influence the severity of infection, the primary determinant of severity is the physiological state of the cow. severity of experimentally induced e.coli mastitis during early lactation was tightly correlated with the pre-infection capacity of isolated blood neutrophils to generate ros after zymosan and phorbol ester stimulation  <cit>  and their chemotactic response as well  <cit> . interleukin  <dig> , an important chemokine in the innate immune response of the mammary gland  <cit> , enhances ros generation  <cit> , causes chemotaxis  <cit>  and delays apoptosis  <cit>  of isolated bovine blood neutrophils in vitro. interleukin  <dig> priming of isolated human neutrophils for higher superoxide production was mediated through cxcr <dig>  and not through cxcr <dig>   <cit> .

many polymorphisms have been detected in the coding region of the bovine cxcr <dig> gene  <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphism  c.735c > g  causes an amino acid change in the third intracellular loop  potentially affecting g-protein binding and signal transduction. furthermore, c.735c > g was found to be in full linkage disequilibrium with snps c.37a > t , c.38 t > a  and c.68g > a  causing amino acid changes p.ile13tyr and p.gly23glu in the n-terminus of cxcr <dig> known to have an important role in the first steps of binding il- <dig>  <cit> . associations between snp c.735c > g and neutrophil functionality have been studied: blood neutrophils with genotype c.735gg showed a higher intracellular calcium release when stimulated with il- <dig> and an increased ros generation in response to pma compared to neutrophils with genotype c.735cc . single nucleotide polymorphisms c.980a > g  and c.995a > g  cause changes in the c-terminus  and might interfere with adaptin- <dig> binding and receptor internalization  <cit> .

previous research indicated an association between snp c.980a > g and likelihood of intramammary infection by major pathogens in early lactating heifers  <cit> . in the present study we wanted to know if cxcr <dig> gene polymorphism  could affect neutrophil functionality. blood neutrophils, with different cxcr <dig> genotype, were isolated from  <dig> heifers during early lactation. ros production as detected by chemiluminescence was measured following il- <dig> incubation and stimulation with either pma or opsonized zymosan particles . freshly calved heifers were sampled because neutrophil functionality is reduced during this period  <cit> .

we report the results of an association study between cxcr1snps c.735c > g and c.980a > g and blood neutrophil ros. additionally, we discuss the unexpected effect rbil- <dig> had on neutrophil ros depending on the stimulatory agent.

methods
study design
the experiment has been approved by the ethical committee of the faculty of veterinary medicine, ghent university . twenty holstein heifers with different cxcr <dig> genotype were included from  <dig> different commercial dairy herds. selected heifers were not siblings, had no history of diseases and all quarters were culture negative for major mastitis pathogens. within 24 h after calving, neutrophils were isolated from blood and incubated with  <dig>   <dig> or 400 ng/ml recombinant bovine il- <dig>  for  <dig> and 6 h. next, neutrophils were stimulated with pma or ozp and ros generation was measured by chemiluminescence. finally associations between ros generation and genotype, incubation time and rbil- <dig> concentration were statistically analyzed. the sample size  was based on previous research demonstrating significant differences in ros generation between  <dig> early and  <dig> mid lactating cows  <cit> . the incubation times were determined in a preliminary experiment in which blood neutrophils from  <dig> early lactating heifers were incubated for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 18 h with  <dig>   <dig> or 400 ng/ml rbil- <dig>  a differential count of the isolated cells was performed to estimate the % neutrophils. viability of neutrophils was measured after isolation and after each incubation time by trypan blue exclusion.

bacteriological culture
as mastitis can affect functionality of blood neutrophils  <cit> , aseptic quarter milk samples were collected at the time of blood sampling and bacteriologically cultured. ten μl of each sample was spread on blood-esculin and macconkey’s agar and incubated aerobically for 24–48 h at 37°c. bacteriological culture was performed according to national mastitis council  guidelines  <cit> . four heifers were culture-positive in five quarters for major pathogens and excluded from the analysis. staphylococcus aureus, esculin-positive cocci and escherichia coli were isolated from  <dig> quarters of  <dig> heifers,  <dig> quarter of  <dig> heifer and  <dig> quarters of  <dig> heifers, respectively.

cxcr <dig> genotype
to include heifers with common and rare cxcr <dig> genotypes , a sufficient number of heifers were genotyped before calving. a blood sample was taken from  <dig> holstein heifers belonging to  <dig> herds and having an expected calving date between january and june  <dig>  genotype at snps c.735c > g and c.980a > g was determined using a fluorescent multiprobe pcr assay as previously described  <cit> . efforts were made to include sufficient heifers with genotype c.980aa or c.980ag. of the  <dig> heifers included in the final analysis,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had genotype c.735cc, c.735cg and c.735gg, respectively. three,  <dig> and  <dig> had genotype c.980aa, c.980ag and c.980gg, respectively.

reactive oxygen species assay
seventy-five ml blood was collected from the coccygeal vein using 8 ml vacutainer tubes  containing 150 μl of edta as anticoagulant. blood neutrophils were isolated within 1 h of collection by hypotonic lysis of red blood cells and histopaque 1077/ <dig> gradient  centrifugation according to siemens et al.  <cit> . cell concentration was measured in triplicate with a bürker chamber.

two hundred thousand blood neutrophils were suspended in 200 μl of  <dig> × hank's balanced salt solution  supplemented with  <dig>   <dig> or 400 ng recombinant bovine il- <dig>  per ml and incubated for  <dig> or 6 h at 37°c in 2 ml test tubes. next, blood neutrophils were pelleted by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for 5 min and resuspended in 120 μl  <dig> × hbss. luminol  and pma  or ozp  were added to a final volume of 200 μl. zymosan a  was opsonized by washing the pellet with  <dig> and 30 ml  <dig> × phosphate-buffered saline   followed by 1 h incubation at 37°c in 5 ml  <dig> × pbs and 35 ml bovine serum and two additional washing steps with 30 ml  <dig> × pbs . bovine serum was collected from the coccygeal vein of a healthy holstein cow using 8 ml gel and clot activator tubes . reactions of blood neutrophils primed by rbil- <dig> were performed in duplicate. chemiluminescence was measured every 60 sec for 90 min with a luminometer  and expressed in relative light units . area under the curve  values  were calculated to analyze the total ros generation whereas peak values  and time of peak values  were saved in the dataset to study the kinetics of ros generation  <cit> .

statistical analysis
different linear mixed regression models  were fit for auc, rlumax and tmax after stimulation with pma or ozp  and for snp c.735c > g or c.980a > g . heifer was added as random effect to correct for clustering of multiple observations  per heifer . the models included heifers’ genotype at position of the snp, incubation  and rbil- <dig>  as categorical fixed effects. all two-way interactions between fixed effects were tested but removed from the models because they were non-significant .

RESULTS
preliminary experiment
a differential count demonstrated  <dig> %  of the isolated cells to be neutrophils. the viability of the neutrophils was 100% immediately after isolation and decreased to 96% , 96% , 98%  and 81%  after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 18 h isolation, respectively. differences in viability between neutrophils incubated with  <dig>   <dig> or 400 ng/ml rbil- <dig> were small . because of the low viability and strongly diminished ros generation after 18 h incubation, neutrophils were incubated for  <dig> and 6 h . as expected  <cit> , chemiluminescence increased fast after pma stimulation with a clear peak and increased more gradually after ozp stimulation .figure  <dig> effect of interleukin- <dig> on reactive oxygen species generation of blood neutrophils.preliminary experiment studying the reactive oxygen species  generation of blood neutrophils isolated from  <dig> early lactating dairy cows and incubated with  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  ng recombinant bovine interleukin- <dig>  per ml for  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  h measured using luminol chemiluminescence . prior to measurement, neutrophils were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  or opsonized zymosan particles .

discussion
research on genetic polymorphisms enlarges our knowledge on mammary gland immunity and helps us to understand why certain cows are more mastitis resistant than others  <cit> . because of the important function of cxcr <dig> in the innate immunity of the mammary gland  <cit>  and a quantitative trait locus for clinical mastitis in this region of the bovine genome  <cit> , cxcr <dig> polymorphisms form interesting study objects. in this study, an in vitro model was used to analyze the effect of cxcr <dig> snp on neutrophil functionality in a sample population of freshly calved heifers. associations between cxcr <dig> genotype and neutrophil ros generation after rbil- <dig> incubation and stimulation with pma or ozp were studied in detail.

the association between snp c.735c > g and pma-induced ros generation reported by rambeaud et al.  could not be confirmed in our model. in contrast to the previously demonstrated higher ros generation  <cit> , we observed numerically lower auc values in c.735gg neutrophils compared to c.735cc neutrophils. additionally, no significant interaction effects between c.735c > g and rbil- <dig> concentration were observed. based on previous research  <cit> , we hypothesized a higher ros generation and response to rbil- <dig> in c.980ag compared to c.980gg neutrophils. however, neither c.980a > g nor the interaction between rbil- <dig> concentration and c.980a > g were associated with auc, rlumax or tmax of pma- or ozp-induced ros generation in our model. despite potential effects on ligand binding, signal transduction and internalization of cxcr <dig>  <cit> , no interaction between cxcr <dig> snps and rbil- <dig> incubation could be demonstrated. human cxcr <dig> but not hcxcr <dig> was found to be important for activation of ros  <cit> . latter functional differences were partly attributed to amino acid sequence differences in the c-terminus causing a faster receptor phosphorylation and internalization of hcxcr <dig> compared to hcxcr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to hcxcr <dig> and hcxcr <dig>  the c-terminus of both bovine il-8r show identical amino acid sequences  <cit> . hence, activation of neutrophils could be mediated by both receptors and functional effects caused by cxcr <dig> snp might be compensated by a fully functional cxcr <dig>  explaining similar rbil- <dig> responses on ros across cxcr <dig> genotypes in our study.

several studies demonstrated a priming effect of il- <dig> on ros generation in human neutrophils  <cit> . enhancement of ros generation already occurred after 5 min of il- <dig> incubation  <cit>  and was explained by intracellular calcium mobilization  <cit>  and by activation of phospholipase d   <cit> , protein kinase c-ε   <cit>  and phospholipase a <dig>  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, mitchell et al.  <cit>  were the only to study the priming effect of il- <dig> on bovine neutrophils. intracellular ros generation was measured by  <dig> -dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate  flow cytometry. incubation with rbil- <dig> for 18 h enhanced the mannheimia haemolytica-induced ros generation whereas incubation for  <dig> or 60 min had little effect  <cit> . in our study, ros generation was measured using luminol chemiluminescence. this assay has the benefit that both intra- and extracellular ros generation are measured and allows for measurement over time  <cit> . neutrophils were exposed to the same concentrations of rbil- <dig> as in the study of mitchell et al.  <cit>  but for only  <dig> or 6 h. we opted not to incubate for 18 h because our preliminary experiments showed a reduced viability and a strongly diminished ros generation after such a long period. associations were detected between rbil- <dig> concentration and ros generation indicating the presence of a functional il- <dig> receptor on the isolated blood neutrophils. in contrast to research on human neutrophils  <cit> , il- <dig> also had inhibitory effects on neutrophils ros generation in our model. incubation with rbil- <dig> had a positive effect on the total pma-induced ros generation but a negative effect on the total ozp-induced ros generation. the stimulatory agent dependent effect could be explained by differences in the pathways of ros generation by pma and ozp  <cit> . incubation with rbil- <dig> might have simultaneously activated components of the pathway induced by pma  while inhibiting components of the pathway induced by ozp .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, no differences in pma- or ozp-induced ros generation were detected in blood neutrophils isolated from early lactating heifers with different cxcr <dig> c.735c > g and c.980a > g genotypes. the inhibitory effects of rbil- <dig> on neutrophil ros generation suggest a complex interaction between il- <dig> and ros generation in bovine neutrophils.
