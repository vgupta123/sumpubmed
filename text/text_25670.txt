BACKGROUND
selective protein-protein interactions are important for cellular functions and are often mediated by protein domains that recognize specific primary sequences within target proteins called short linear motifs . accurate prediction of slims has been difficult because they are short  and highly degenerate. a major advance in slim identification came with a peptide library-based technique that can map the sequence motif recognized by an sh <dig> domain without prior knowledge of in vivo interaction sites  <cit> . similar peptide library experiments have been performed to map the motifs recognized by other domains. motifs discovered through polypeptide library screening have shown high levels of agreement with reported domain interaction sites  <cit> . this became the basis for scansite  <cit> , a bioinformatics program developed to predict slims in query proteins that are recognized by specific protein domains. other bioinformatic approaches, like those available in minimotif-miner  <cit> , quasimotiffinder  <cit> , mcs  <cit>  and a tree-based scoring  <cit>  applied evolutionary conservation as well as other sequence filters to assess the functional relevance of a hit.

both peptide library screening and evolutionary conservation proved to be useful in prediction motifs, we hypothesized that combining chemical enrichment scoring matrixes derived from peptide libraries and conservation analysis would discriminate between classes of proteins that have functional slims and those that do not. to address this issue, we conducted a global statistical analysis on the conservation of slims recognized by sh <dig>  sh <dig>  pdz and s/t kinase domains  in different functional classes of proteins. for each domain we studied, our analysis revealed that domain-recognized slims are highly conserved in specific functional classes of proteins that are known to frequently interact with that domain, but they are not conserved in most other protein groups. for example, we found that slims that interact with sh <dig> domains are conserved in receptor kinases/phosphatases, adaptor molecules, and tyrosine kinases/phosphatases. our analysis also confirmed that most sh2-mediated signaling occurs in the cytoplasm, and suggests that slims that are recognized by tyrosine kinases and are in proteins that contain multiple sh <dig> binding motifs are more likely to interact with sh <dig> domains.

RESULTS
relative conservation  of slims
relative conservation of slims was measured to assess their functional importance. the central hypothesis was that slims should be subject to two kinds of evolutionary selection. the first is background selection, which is imposed upon the entire length of the protein sequence, and is due to factors such as the overall stability, structure, and function of the protein. the second is slim-specific selection superimposed on the background, due to the special function mediated by the slim. therefore, a well-conserved slim in an overall highly conserved protein does not guarantee independent importance. for example, although the two putative sh <dig> binding tyr-slims in histone h <dig>  were conserved among sequences from all selected species , their relative conservation was low because of the highly conserved background . it is possible tyr-slims in histone h <dig>  are conserved because they have an integral function in protein structure or stability. conversely, a slim with high relative conservation is an indication that the motif may play a unique physiological role. the five tyr-slims in the c-terminus of il4r are well conserved, while the full-length protein is not ; thus, these slims have a high level of relative conservation . in fact, four of these five conserved tyrosine motifs are reported to bind to sh <dig> domains  <cit> . the relative conservation method allows us to discriminate between slims that have been conserved due to structural constraints of the protein from those that have been conserved to serve as functional motifs. we do not argue against the importance of conserved motifs in conserved proteins; however, we consider them less likely to function independently.

analysis of sh <dig> domain-mediated signaling in  <dig> highly studied receptor tyrosine kinases 
to test the functional relevance of our slim conservation calculation, we analyzed reported sh <dig> binding sites in  <dig> highly-studied rtks , including egfr, ir, kit, pdgfrb, igf-ir, vegfr <dig>  erbb <dig>  fgfr <dig>  hgfr, ret and tkr-a. we manually extracted interactions from the literature between one of these rtks and one of the  <dig> sh <dig> domains we are studying here, which yielded a total of  <dig> interactions involving  <dig> unique tyr-slims . using our slim conservation calculation, we found that reported sh <dig> binding sites have significantly higher  ln scores  than those sites that do not bind to sh <dig> domains , indicating the relative conservation score is an effective distinguishing factor of functional binding slims.

in order to evaluate the specificity of motif prediction, we compared the sh <dig> selectivity values  of slims in proteins from reported binding groups to the sh <dig> selectivity values of slims in proteins from groups that are not reported to bind. we found that less than 40% of non-binding slims have a selectivity value >  <dig>  whereas over 80% of binding slims have a selectivity value greater than  <dig>  higher selectivity values correspond to a higher specificity of interaction . these results demonstrate that predicting domain binding to slims based on motifs from peptide library experiments is effective.

global conservation analysis of slims recognized by sh <dig>  sh <dig>  pdz and s/t kinase domains
using the plc-γ <dig> n-terminal sh <dig> domain as a model to study the relationship between conservation and function of slims, we found that tyr-slims predicted to bind to the plc-γ <dig> n-terminal sh <dig> domain  have significantly higher ln scores, compared to tyr-slims in plc-γ <dig> binding proteins  and receptor kinase/phosphatase proteins  not predicted to bind to the n-terminal sh <dig> domain . no significant increase in ln score was observed for sh2-recognized  tyr-slims in cell cycle control proteins ; importantly, cell cycle control proteins are rarely reported to bind to sh <dig> proteins.

taking into consideration all binding partners, we found that for  <dig> of the  <dig> sh <dig> motifs, tyr-slims recognized by sh <dig> domains  have a higher average ln score than those not recognized by sh <dig> domains ;  <dig> of these are statistically significant . in the receptor kinase and phosphatase group,  <dig> cases showed a significant increase in ln score. however, no significant increase in ln score was observed in the cell cycle control protein group .

we then systematically examined the conservation of slims recognized by sh <dig>  sh <dig>  pdz and s/t kinase domains  in representative protein functional classes taken from the hprd database . those functional groups that show significant increase of conservation highly correlated with those that frequently interact with respective domains . we observed that sh2-recognized slims  are most highly conserved in receptor kinases/phosphatases, adaptor molecules, tyrosine kinases/phosphatases and structural proteins; conservation was occasionally found in cytokine/immune receptors, cell junction proteins and cytoskeletal-associated proteins. most other functional protein classes had little conservation signal. this result correlated well with those protein functional groups frequently interact with sh <dig> proteins as listed in table  <dig>  there are also some sporadic signals such as nck in adhesion molecules and gtpase, vav in cytoskeletal proteins and shc in dna binding proteins, suggesting they may interact with proteins in those functional groups.

* the binding ratio is calculated as the percentage of proteins that interact with proteins containing sh <dig>  sh <dig>  or pdz domains.

# the phosphorylation ratio is calculated as the ratio of serine residues that are phosphorylated.

for sh3-recognized slims , conservation was strongest in cytoskeletal and cytoskeletal-associated proteins. calcium binding proteins, rna binding proteins, tyr-kinases/phosphatases and guanine nucleotide exchange factors also had strong conservation signals. the conservation signal was almost absent in other functional classes. this is largely consistent with those frequently reported sh <dig> interacting protein groups .

consistent with biochemical evidences that pdz domains frequently interact with membrane proteins, we found that pdz domain-recognized slims  are specifically conserved in membrane proteins including channels, integral membrane proteins, cell surface receptors, g protein/g protein coupled receptors and membrane transport proteins. the frequent interacting partners of pdz domain containing proteins are channels, adhesion molecules and cell surface receptors . our results suggest that those membrane proteins such as integral membrane proteins were probably less well studied but nevertheless play an important role in interaction with pdz domain.

as shown in figure 3b, fourth panel, the proteins containing slims recognized by s/t kinases in the basophilic group  seem to be involved in a wider variety of cellular functions than proteins with slims recognized by sh <dig>  sh <dig> and pdz domains. s/t kinase domain-recognized slims were conserved in proteins involved in signal transduction , in cytoskeletal-associated proteins, in proteins related to transcription and cell-cycle control, and also in some membrane proteins. however, the proteins containing conserved slims recognized by proline-dependent ser/thr kinases  were more specifically involved in transcription and cell-cycle control, with almost no conservation signal from other functional categories. the conservation pattern of slims recognized by s/t kinases is highly consistent with protein functional groups with high serine phosphorylation ratio .

remarkably, most functional classes of proteins with a significant conservation signal were highly specific for the signal within one group of domains, but not in other groups. for example, receptor kinase/phosphatase group show conservation signal only in sh <dig> domain group and transcription factors only in ser/thr kinase domain group  nevertheless, a few protein functional classes exhibited a significant conservation signal in multiple groups of domains, such as adaptor molecules and cytoskeletal-associated protein groups; this corresponds to the fact that these proteins participate in multiple signaling pathways involving interactions with more than one domain.

in order to further examine the specificity of the conservation signal, we calculated the conservation profile of slims in each protein functional class by calculating the difference in ln score between slims with high selectivity and those with low selectivity. we also compared functional classes that are frequent, occasional or rare interaction partners for each domain by setting thresholds for the percentage of proteins in the functional class that either interact with or become phosphorylated by proteins containing that domain . as expected, the conservation signal was highest in functional classes of proteins that are frequently reported to interact with a specific domain, and the signal progressively decreased for functional protein classes that are reported to interact occasionally or rarely with binding partners . conservation profiles calculated as the change in ln score between slims with upper-medium to medium selectivity values and slims with low selectivity values showed similar trends, but were less significant . in the above experiments, slims for sh <dig> domains, pdz domains or s/t kinases with selectivity values of <  <dig>  5– <dig>  10– <dig>  and >  <dig> were assigned to the categories of low, medium, upper medium and high selectivity, respectively; slims with sh <dig> selectivity values of <  <dig>  3– <dig>  6– <dig>  and >  <dig> were assigned to the categories of low, medium, upper medium and high selectivity, respectively.

conservation of slims in sub-cellular localization and in multi-domain signaling
using sh <dig> domain-interacting slims as a model, we applied our method of conservation analysis to study additional aspects of slim conservation. specifically, we investigated the conservation of slims in proteins that interact with two different protein domains in a signaling pathway, and we studied the relationship between conservation of slims and sub-cellular localization.

consistent with the observation that sh2-mediated signaling mainly occurs in the cytoplasm, we found a conservation signal for sh2-recognized slims in cytoplasmic but not extra-cellular regions in both type i and ii membrane proteins .  since the majority of membrane proteins are type i, we further classified this group by protein function. the conservation signal is strongest for slims on the cytoplasmic side of receptor kinases/phosphatases, cell surface receptors, cytokine/immune receptors and adhesion molecules, and weaker for slims in channels and metabolic enzymes . sh2-domain binding is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by tyr kinases. accordingly, slims recognized by tyr kinases should be more likely to interact with sh <dig> domains. we found that sh2-recognized slims that were selected for based on the presence of a common tyrosine kinase motif  are more conserved than those without this selection .

on the other hand, many tyrosine kinases  and adaptor molecules have both sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains, and it has been suggested that proteins containing multiple sh <dig> binding sites are more likely to be tyrosine phosphorylated and bind to sh <dig> domains as supported by biochemical studies  <cit> . consistent with this reasoning, sh2-recognized tyr-slims in signal transduction proteins that have more than ten pxxp sh <dig> binding motifs are significantly more conserved than slims without this selection . however, this trend is not observed in slims in functional classes other than signal transduction protein class , which agrees well with the fact that most sh2-binding proteins are signal transduction proteins.

we further divided signal transduction groups into subgroups according to sub-cellular localization. under selections for both the kinase motif and sh <dig> binding motifs, a high level of slim conservation was most manifest in signal transduction proteins localized to the cytoplasm or plasma membrane, but conversation of slims was weaker for those proteins localized to the nucleus . this is consistent with biochemical evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation occurs mainly in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane . conservation profiles for different functional classes of proteins with or without sh <dig> and tyr-kinase domain selection are shown in figure 6b.

these findings support the hypothesis that tyrosine kinases and sh <dig> domains are frequently coupled to sh <dig> domain signaling. the coupling between a tyrosine kinase and sh <dig> domains is expected, since an sh <dig> domain can only bind to a tyr-slim after the tyrosine residue has been phosphorylated by a tyr-kinase. however, the coupling between sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains might be less direct. either a sequential model or a cooperative model, depending on whether the target tyrosine residue is phosphorylated before the interaction, may be used to explain the coupling between sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains . in the sequential model, pxxp motifs recruit sh <dig> domain containing tyr-kinases, which in turn phosphorylate the tyrosine residues in the target protein. the pyxxx motif can then recruit an sh <dig> domain . in the cooperative model, the sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains in a single kinase or adaptor molecule bind to the pyxxx motif and the pxxp motif, respectively, to increase the strength of the interaction . both of these models may explain the coupling between sh <dig> and sh <dig> domains. early in tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction, most tyrosine residues are not phosphorylated, so the sequential model may prevail. however, after more tyrosine residues in signaling proteins become phosphorylated, the cooperative model may become increasingly relevant.

discussion
protein-protein interactions mediated by slims have a widespread influence on cellular functions <cit> . in this study, we examined these interactions by combining scoring matrixes derived from peptide library and conservation analysis. we detected signals of evolutionary conservation in slims in proteins from functional classes that are known to participate in the signal transduction of a specific protein domain. further, our analysis of membrane proteins indicated that only the cytoplasmic side is involved in sh <dig> signaling in both type i and ii membrane proteins. our results also suggest that tyrosine kinase and sh <dig> domains are coupled with sh <dig> domain signaling in signal transduction proteins.

it was recently reported that several bacterially secreted cytotoxins contain multiple repeated tyr-slims with high affinity for both tyrosine kinases and sh <dig> domains  <cit> . many of these cytotoxins are phosphorylated upon entry into host cells and bind to a variety of sh <dig> proteins. for example, the caga protein secreted by helicobacter pylori can be phosphorylated by src and associates with shp <dig>  <cit>  and csk  <cit>  sh <dig> domains, which is essential for cellular changes induced by the bacteria. the strong cellular response initiated by these sh <dig> binding tyr-slims further supports our assumption that slims are under continuous evolutionary selection to preserve functional sites and eliminate harmful mutations. recent work on the negative selection of sh <dig> domain-recognized sequences  <cit>  also suggests that slims may undergo strong evolutionary selection.

while most protein functional classes with strong conservation signal are known to be involved in the signaling of respective domains, there are a few exceptions, which may represent undiscovered but functional binding sites. for example, although less than 3% structural and cytoskeletal proteins have been recorded to bind to sh <dig> proteins, their tyr-slims selected by sh <dig> domains had significantly increased cr scores. it has been reported that alpha-tubulin, a cytoskelatal protein, binds to the fyn sh <dig> domain  <cit> , and that the intermediate filaments of the cytokeratin type are reported to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . in the latter case, further evaluation is necessary to determine whether the phosphorylation leads to sh <dig> binding.

another interesting observation is that dna binding proteins also have conservation signal in their potential sh <dig> binding sites. although tyrosine phosphorylation is generally believed to be less common in the nucleus, more and more evidences for the tyrosine phosphorylation of dna binding proteins are reported as in the case of krc dna binding protein  <cit> , estrogen receptor  <cit> , tfii-i  <cit>  and more examples provided in  <cit> . since many sh2-containing proteins were reported to enter nucleus such as fes  <cit> , shc  <cit> , nck  <cit>  and vav  <cit> . sh <dig> domains may mediate functional interactions with dna binding proteins. similar to sh <dig> domain, we observed that dna binding proteins also have conservation signal in potential pdz binding sites. although most reported interactions mediated by pdz domains are restricted to membrane proteins, proteins that contain pdz domain  were reported to enter nucleus suggesting they may mediate protein-protein interactions in the nucleus. whether these observations represent a new trend of research is worth investigation.

although our results from conservation analysis correlated well with biochemical data in general, our method is still prone to error. first, our motif prediction is based on in vitro peptide scanning techniques, which may be biased due to differences between in vitro and in vivo conditions. second, we assumed that each position of the slim contributed equally to binding, and only slims that were conserved at each position were assumed to be conserved. to improve this method in the future, different weights could be assigned to each position, and amino acid similarity could be considered. finally, evolutionary conservation can only provide indirect clues regarding function. for example, some slims may only be important for a few species, and these would not have been detected in our analysis.

our results indicate that the conservation pattern of slims recognized by sh <dig>  sh <dig>  pdz, and s/t kinase domains highly correlates with the function of these domains. as motifs recognized by other domains are better defined, conservation analysis will be able to provide valuable clues as to their functional roles, as well as possible preferences for their sub-cellular localization or for their coupling with other domains and even structural implications. for example, in a recently published paper  <cit> , the authors show that slims are more likely to be conserved in disordered protein regions. recently, peptide array based technology has been developed and is becoming increasingly available  <cit> . new technologies are expected to make motif discoveries easier and potentially more accurate. currently, many of the motifs discovered are only defined as regular expressions, which usually provide less information than those motifs defined from the result of peptide library screening. nevertheless, it should be possible to retrieve useful information from those less well-defined motifs using more sophisticated algorithms in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
this study systematically studied the evolutionary conservation of slims recognized by sh <dig>  sh <dig>  pdz and s/t kinase domains which reflected the interactome of these domains. specifically, slims within certain protein functional groups that are frequently involved in the interaction with that domain are significantly more conserved than those slims within other groups. study of manually extracted sh <dig> interaction sites in  <dig> most studied receptor tyrosine kinases provided experimental evidence that tyr-slims reported to interact with sh <dig> are significantly more conserved than those that do not. furthermore, by analysis of slims in membrane proteins and under selection of two different domains, we show that this conservation analysis can also provide useful information about the sub-cellular localization of the interaction and domain coupling.
