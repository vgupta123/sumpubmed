BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass  of the mammalian blastocyst. they have the potential to differentiate, both in vitro and in vivo, into derivatives of all three embryonic germ cell layers. according to current understanding, es cells can be maintained in an undifferentiated stage indefinitely in adequate culture conditions  <cit> .

the first human es cell  lines were isolated in  <dig> raising hopes for hesc derived cell replacement therapies for various degenerative diseases  <cit> . as the es cell lines are derived from individual embryos, they are likely to have unique characteristics. recent studies focusing on epigenetic of different hesc lines have indeed indicated that individual cell lines may have distinct line specific epigenetic profiles  <cit>  which may affect their differentiation properties. adaptation to distinct cell culture conditions may cause selection pressure altering the features of the cell lines at the epigenetic or chromosomal level. while there are plenty of studies regarding differentiation of hesc into a variety of cell types, only a few studies address the differences between individual cell lines and they are mainly focused on transcriptional profiling. although these studies have indicated that the mrna expression patterns do vary to some extent between the hesc lines, biological significance of the variation has not been studied in detail  <cit> .

undifferentiated es cells are characterized by a distinct morphology and by the expression of molecular markers typical for mammalian pluripotent cells. the most commonly used cell surface markers on hesc are the glycolipid antigens ssea- <dig> and ssea- <dig> and the keratan sulphate proteoglygans tra 1– <dig> and tra 1– <dig>  they are also expressed in the icm cells of human blastocysts as well as in pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cells  <cit> . in addition to the surface markers, the expression of certain transcription factors is a hallmark of es cells. oct- <dig>  is the best known and most widely used. it is expressed in the icm of the blastocyst stage embryo and becomes downregulated upon differentiation  <cit> . later, a homeoprotein named nanog was found to be present exclusively in undifferentiated es cells  <cit>  and also shown to be crucial for the formation of pluripotent icm cells in mouse  <cit> . recent studies have indicated that genes involved in the early commitment of primordial germ cells  are expressed in undifferentiated hescs as well  <cit> . indeed, it has been postulated that the closest in vivo equivalents of the es cells might be the early committed pgcs rather than primitive ectoderm cells  <cit> .

in this report, we describe the derivation of five hesc lines from frozen-thawed human embryos. a universal transcriptional comparison of these lines has been reported earlier  <cit> . we now report of the variable differentiation characteristics between individual lines and of the expression of pgc associated genes in undifferentiated and in vitro differentiated cells.

RESULTS
derivation and culture of the hesc lines
out of  <dig> frozen-thawed zygotes,  <dig>  formed blastocysts. of the  <dig> blastocysts,  <dig> icms were successfully isolated onto human foreskin fibroblast  or mouse embryonic fibroblast  feeder cells. five  isolated icms formed continuously growing hesc lines. two of the hesc lines  were initially established on mef and three  on hff feeder cells. later all the cell lines were characterized on both feeder types. the gene expression and teratoma analysis was performed with hescs cultured on hffs, embryoid body  formation analyses with hesc cultured on mef.

the morphology of the hesc colonies didn't vary remarkably between the two feeder systems, if the cells were passaged mechanically. however, the density of the colonies within single dishes was clearly higher in mef cultures than in cultures grown on hff feeders. notably, new hesc colonies appeared to start to grow from smaller pieces of passaged colonies on mef than on hff . while cell clusters with 20– <dig> cells frequently attached on mef feeders and start to grow as undifferentiated colonies more than  <dig> cells/cluster appeared to be needed to initiate normal undifferentiated growth on hff feeders. furthermore, the small hesc clusters attached on hff feeders differentiated more easily than on mef feeders. we also analyzed the population doubling time of the cells in both culture systems. the average growth rate of fes  <dig> cells was approximately  <dig>  times higher  when cultured on mef as compared to hff . the hesc lines were initially passaged mechanically by splitting colonies in up to  <dig> clusters  and transferring pieces on new dishes. in order to more effectively expand the cell mass, enzymatic passaging with collagenase was introduced. although both feeder types maintained the pluripotency of the hesc lines, hff did not support long term enzymatic passaging in our hands. eventually  the cells lost their pluripotency and differentiated into various lineages. four cell lines retained a normal male karyotype  <dig>  xy and one  a normal female karyotype  <dig>  xx as long as the cells were cultured on human feeders. however, after about  <dig> passages on mouse feeders with enzymatic passaging, abnormal karyotypes were found in two lines. the karyotype of fes  <dig> cells was transformed into  <dig>  xy, + <dig>  + <dig> and that of fes  <dig> cells into  <dig>  xx, + <dig> .

the expression of hesc markers
all the fes lines expressed oct- <dig> and nanog as detected by rt-pcr. the cells were also positive for the hesc associated epitopes tra 1– <dig>  tra 1– <dig> and ssea- <dig> as detected by immunohistochemistry  or flow cytometry and had strong alkaline phosphatase activity .

we next identified the mrna expression of various germ cell associated genes known or suspected to have roles in preventing the differentiation of primordial germ cells in other organisms or whose expression has previously been found to be restricted to germ cells. their specificity for undifferentiated fes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cells was evaluated by comparing their expression levels in undifferentiated hescs, ebs and stage  <dig>  differentiated cells . all the studied germ cell associated genes dazl, pum <dig>  stellar, piwil <dig> and tex- <dig> as well as oct- <dig>  nanog and fgf- <dig>  genes that have been previously described to play essential roles in the regulation of hesc pluripotency, were detected in the lines analyzed. they were also expressed in ebs, indicating either presence of a substantial amount of undifferentiated cells in ebs or that the expression of these genes is not strictly restricted to pluripotent hescs. the more fully differentiated stage  <dig> cells  showed weak expression of pum <dig> and tex- <dig> transcripts, while oct- <dig>  nanog, fgf <dig>  dazl, stellar and piwil <dig> were all undetectable at this stage.

embryoid body formation
the spontaneous differentiation capacity of the fes cell lines was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. all the cell lines formed ebs with typical cystic morphology. the ebs contained cells expressing markers of all three germ cell layer derivatives .

interestingly, clear cell-line dependent variation in eb formation was reproducibly detected. the fes  <dig> cell line formed fewer ebs as compared to fes  <dig> and  <dig> lines  . we next analyzed the expression of various differentiation markers after eb formation by ihc. the total area of oct- <dig> positive cells counted from two independent sections of approximately 50– <dig> ebs was clearly larger in fes  <dig> derived ebs  than in those derived from fes  <dig> or  <dig> lines  indicating significant difference in the loss of pluripotent cells between the analyzed hesc lines. on the other hand, there was practically no expression of the mesodermal marker brachyury in fes  <dig>  while it was readily detectable in fes  <dig> and  <dig> derived ebs . similarly, fes  <dig> ebs showed minimal expression of endodermal hnf3β protein while the corresponding expression levels were 6– <dig> fold higher in ebs derived from fes  <dig> and fes  <dig> ). altogether, the results show that in the given eb assay, fes  <dig> cells differentiate less readily than do fes  <dig> and  <dig> cells.

teratoma formation
to study the in vivo differentiation potential, cells from all fes lines were transplanted into nude mouse testis. again, the differentiation patterns of the teratomas showed clear line specific features. fes 30-derived teratomas always consisted of more cystic components with a smaller solid tumor mass as compared with the other lines  . specific markers of all three germ layer derivatives  were detected from teratomas of all lines both with ihc  and rt-pcr . vimentin-positive mesenchymal tissues as well as desmin-positive muscle cells were abundant signs of mesodermal differentiation. likewise, ectoderm-derived neurofilament-positive cells were frequent in most tumors, although least in fes  <dig> teratomas . definitive endodermal derivatives, characterized by gut-like mucoid epithelial structures with foxa2/hnf-3β-positive cells were relatively abundant in teratomas derived from particularly the fes  <dig> line, but only rarely detected in fes 30-teratomas . in rt-pcr analyses teratomas from fes  <dig> were positive for ectodermal and mesodermal marker genes but not for endodermal genes. in contrast, teratomas from other analyzed fes lines showed clear signals also for endodermal markers .

discussion
we have successfully derived and expanded five hesc lines characterized by previously established criteria, including the capacity to differentiate both in vitro and in vivo into derivatives of all three germ cell layers. however, distinct line specific features were observed in terms of differentiation patterns. one of the novel lines, fes  <dig>  repeatedly produced fewer, less diverse and smaller ebs than the other lines. fes  <dig> cells also maintained the expression of pluripotency-associated genes longer and differentiated less readily than the other lines when allowed to form embryoid bodies in vitro or teratomas in vivo.

in our previous genetic profiling of the four fes lines  <cit>  the overall expression patterns were remarkably similar and fes  <dig> cells did not differ from the others in any major way. the expression levels of known pluripotency factors oct- <dig> and nanog that might be involved in the regulation of the differentiation tendency of hesc were verified by qrt-pcr revealing fairly constant expression of these genes in all cell lines. yet, "functional tests" like teratoma or eb formation indicate that prominent variation between the cell lines may exist. parallel to our finding, a recent study with mouse embryonic stem cell  indicated that even monozygotic twin mesc lines  have differences in their differentiation patterns, suggesting that individual cells/cell compartments within the icm may be committed to distinct developmental pathways or that at the time of esc line formation the microenvironment may direct esc line properties  <cit> . several other hypothetical reasons for variable differentiation capacities can be postulated. for example some lines may be more prone to general or regional epigenetic changes occurring during culture and this might affect differentiation properties of the hesc lines. alternatively, the embryos from which the lines are derived may have developmental defects that are not evident at blastocyst stage but manifest only later. interestingly, the fes  <dig> cell line is the only female cell line used in our study. the role of the gender is expected to be irrelevant in early developmental processes but it can be hypothesized that for example epigenetic processes could be differently controlled in female and male lines which might also affect differentiation potential of the hesc. nevertheless, this finding highlights the importance of conducting biological experiments with more than one cell line before drawing general conclusions about hesc physiology.

three of the novel hesc lines were established on human foreskin fibroblasts as reported by hovatta et al  <cit>  in order to minimize the exposure of the cells to non-human compounds. only five hesc lines could be established out of the  <dig> successful icm isolations, which correspond to a 7% success rate. in our ivf clinic the respective implantation rate  for blastocysts derived from frozen-thawed embryos is over 30%, indicating that the quality of the embryos should probably allow a substantially higher success rate for hesc line establishment. based on our experience, hffs do not support hesc growth as well as mefs. however, it has been shown  <cit>  that there is substantial variation between different human feeder types in their capacity to support the self-renewal of hescs. it is possible that another human feeder cell type could support hesc growth and self-renewal better than our current hffs. this may also have affected the derivation efficacy of new hesc lines.

all the fes lines have been in continuous culture for one to three years  without losing their pluripotency. normal  <dig> xx  or xy  karyotypes have been detected at least twice for every fes line, mainly on hff feeders. however, after transferring the cells on mef feeders and starting to passage them enzymatically, changes in the chromosomal constitutions of fes  <dig> and  <dig> involving chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found. similar kinds of changes  have been reported for three other hesc lines  <cit> . cowan et al  <cit>  reported the derivation of  <dig> new hesc cell lines that were passaged by trypsin from the beginning. general chromosomal changes  were observed in these lines after prolonged culture. one possible explanation for this may be linked to the passaging method. enzymatic trypsin- or collagenase-based methods most likely favor the selection of fast growing cells, which may have undergone mutations or chromosomal rearrangements. we propose that mechanical splitting methods should be used initially for the first 20– <dig> passages to ensure that karyotypically normal frozen stocks can be established. these findings also emphasize the importance of frequent karyotype analyses to assure that results obtained in any studies with hescs are not biased because of abnormal chromosomal constitution.

to identify new specific markers for hesc cells and to reveal genes possibly involved in the maintenance of pluripotency, we analyzed the mrna expression of several germ cell associated genes at various stages of hesc differentiation. the fact that hescs  express several markers that distinguish epiblast cells from early pgcs as well as some other findings related to the formation of mesc lines have raised the question whether es cells might actually be more closely related to pgcs than epiblastic cells  <cit> . stella  is a transcription factor exclusively expressed in a subset of mouse epiblastic cells committed to become primordial germ cells  <cit> . dazl is an autosomal homologue of the y-chromosomal daz gene and is expressed in humans also in oocytes and preimplantation embryos up to blastocyst stage  <cit> . recently, daz and dazl were shown to interact with pum <dig> protein  <cit>  which is a homologue to drosophila pumilio, an essential gene in maintaining the normal primordial germ cell population of the adult fly  <cit> . according to our expression analyses, these genes, as well as testes specific piwil <dig> and tex- <dig>  <cit> , can be used as markers for undifferentiated hescs. the exact biological roles or interactions with other genes of any of these pgc/germ cell associated genes are not known. however, our results indicate that hescs express several germ cell associated genes that may be involved in the molecular mechanisms regulating early differentiation and/or self-renewal of these cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have derived five new hesc lines and characterized them extensively. several important lessons can be learned from this work: first, due to poorly understood reasons, the lines may vary substantially in their spontaneous differentiation properties even though there are no obvious differences in the generally accepted es cell characteristics in the undifferentiated state. second, in order to obtain a cell growth rate required for many purposes, the hescs need to be grown on embryonic mouse feeders which also make it possible to use enzymatic instead of mechanical passaging of the cells. however, these conditions may of the lead to chromosomal instability. third, several genes expressed in primordial germ cells may serve as useful additional pluripotency markers.
