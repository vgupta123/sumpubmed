BACKGROUND
contamination of lettuce with the human enteric pathogens, escherichia coli o157:h <dig> and salmonella enterica has caused several outbreaks of foodborne disease in the us and other parts of the world  <cit> . although the persistence of these human pathogens on lettuce in the field has been documented  <cit> , factors that contribute to their survival and potential multiplication on plants remain largely unknown. as for other bacteria that immigrate onto plant surfaces, it is likely that the survival of enteric pathogens is affected by the plant microbial community and various physicochemical stresses that prevail in the lettuce phyllosphere. in addition to moving through stomata to the mesophyll tissue of the leaf  <cit> , where it may be shielded from such conditions as desiccation and uv irradiation, eco <dig> may gain access to protective sites that result from the infection by plant pathogens. lettuce can be infected by a broad range of bacterial, fungal, oomycete, and viral pathogens  <cit> , the prevalence of which greatly depends on environmental conditions and the genotype of the plant itself. downy mildew, a disease of lettuce caused by the obligate oomycete pathogen, bremia lactucae regel, is endemic to many important lettuce producing areas of california  <cit> . several outbreaks of eco <dig> infections have been traced back to a major lettuce-production region in california  <cit>  in which this enteric pathogen is highly prevalent  <cit> . b. lactucae survives in crop debris from infected leaf tissue and on weed hosts. representative symptoms of downy mildew disease on lettuce are shown in figure  <dig>  in the early stages of plant infection, the pathogen causes angular chlorotic lesions bordered by the leaf veins. growth of mycelia and the presence of small dense masses of grayish spores are observed mostly on the abaxial surface of the leaves. the infected tissue eventually becomes necrotic and dies  <cit> . b. lactucae benefits from humidity and cool temperatures and therefore, infection rates of lettuce are high during conditions promoting long durations of morning leaf wetness  <cit> . the incidence of the disease in the salinas growing region of coastal california generally increases in the autumn lettuce crop  <cit> .figure  <dig>

biotrophic and necrotrophic fungi that cause post-harvest decay have been shown in several instances to enhance the colonization of fruit and vegetables by enteric pathogens. glomerella cingulata infection of apple fruit promoted proliferation of listeria monocytogenes and eco <dig>  likely due to a change of ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> , whereas the reverse effect was observed with penicillium expansum  <cit> . alternaria alternata and cladosporium spp. had a positive effect on s. enterica colonization of tomato fruit  <cit>  and fusarium spp. prolonged the survival of eco <dig> on tomato under storage conditions but not that of l. monocytogenes  <cit> . these observations suggest that the effect of pathogenic fungi on enteric pathogens in plant tissue may vary depending on several factors in this tri-partite association.

despite the endemic nature of downy mildew disease in lettuce fields in california and other regions in the united states, and the increased appearance of disease symptoms on plants near harvest maturity i.e. not long prior to the lettuce crop reaching the consumer, the role of b. lactucae infection in the behavior of eco <dig> on lettuce has not been investigated. b. lactucae requires free water on the phylloplane for spore germination and invasion of plant cells, a condition that also promotes the survival and multiplication of eco <dig> on lettuce  <cit> . additionally, lesions caused by b. lactucae are known to act as portals to necrotrophic plant pathogens, such as botrytis cinerea, which colonize the broken tissue as secondary invaders  <cit> . our study investigates the potential of downy mildew lesions to serve as a portal for eco <dig> and to create a habitat where the human pathogen may thrive opportunistically by gaining protection from environmental insults within the plant tissue.

RESULTS
effect of downy mildew disease on eco <dig> and s. enterica under wet conditions
in order to investigate the growth potential of eco <dig> and s. enterica in diseased tissue during presence of free water on lettuce plants, such as may occur during periods of rain, dew or overhead watering, the pathogens were inoculated onto leaves that were then incubated under conditions promoting wetness on their surface. as we observed previously on romaine lettuce  <cit> , both enteric pathogens achieved population increases of approximately 102-fold on the healthy leaf tissue . the presence of necrosis due to infection by b. lactucae  promoted enhanced colonization by both enteric bacteria since the population sizes on the healthy and infected tissue diverged greatly by  <dig> h post-inoculation. although we did not test for the possible asymptomatic presence of the oomycete in some of the visually healthy tissue that was used in our study, the disease symptoms clearly resulted in greater population densities of the enteric pathogens than the seemingly healthy tissue. overall, the population sizes of eco <dig> and s. typhimurium in the lesions increased at least 105-fold over  <dig> h at warm temperature. this high carrying capacity of the diseased leaf tissue is likely due to the abundant nutrients made available by the oomycete degradation of plant cells and their contents.figure  <dig>

lettuce leaves are rich in a variety of carbohydrates, including sucrose, glucose, fructose, galactose and mannose  <cit> . eco <dig> rapidly activates multiple carbohydrate transport systems and utilization pathways upon exposure to lysates of romaine lettuce leaves  <cit> . although it is likely that the oomycete itself acquires a large share of the nutrients present in plant cells, the collapsed leaf tissue at advanced stages of the disease such as that inoculated in this study probably supports high rates of multiplication of the human pathogens without overall significant competition by the plant pathogen. another possibility is that at advanced stages of the disease, the oomycete scavenges plant components, the degradation of which makes substrates available to eco <dig>  it is noteworthy that leaf damage caused by phytopathogens does not de facto promote colonization by enteric pathogens. for example, s. enterica levels in lettuce shoots also inoculated with lettuce mosaic virus  were not different than in non-lmv-infected plants and even decreased in infected plants grown under water stress  <cit> . additionally, eco <dig> cell density on spinach was unaffected by its co-inoculation with pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  a plant pathogen that caused necrotic lesions on the leaves  <cit> . thus, factors additional to leakages of substrates from infected cells are at play in the interaction of enteric pathogens with plant pathogens.

localization of eco <dig> by microscopy
confocal microscopy of downy mildew necrotic lesions clearly illustrates the large masses of gfp-eco <dig> cells that result from colonization of these sites compared with the few microcolonies that formed at discrete locations on the epidermis of healthy leaf tissue . of interest also, is the external and internal colonization of the oomycete hyphae that we observed  <dig> h after eco <dig> came in contact with the plant pathogen through inoculation of the necrotic tissue. this is apparent in figure 3b but more specifically in the single confocal optical scan through the hypha shown in figure 3c, which reveals that the mass of eco <dig> cells is bound by the hyphal cell wall and located internally. it remains unclear however, if the human pathogen invaded the oomycete actively, or if it gained access due to damage and thus, ports of entry, on the hyphae. this important aspect of eco157-b. lactucae interactions deserves further investigation, particularly in the light of previous studies demonstrating the inhibition of fungi by various bacterial species  <cit> . if invasion of hyphae by eco <dig> can indeed occur, the invaded hyphae may serve as a vessel for enteric bacteria to enter the intracellular space of plants.figure  <dig>

role of plant susceptibility to downy mildew in eco <dig> growth
reports on the role of plant genotype in the microbial community composition of the lettuce phyllosphere have been inconsistent  <cit> . numerous lettuce cultivars have been developed in order to minimize crop yield losses incurred from plant disease, including downy mildew. given the highly hospitable environment of downy mildew lesions to eco <dig>  as illustrated in figure  <dig>  we investigated the role of plant susceptibility to b. lactucae infection in lettuce colonization by this human pathogen. a commercially released lettuce cultivar triple threat and a newly developed lettuce breeding line rh08- <dig> were selected to test this hypothesis. triple threat is highly susceptible to infection by b. lactuacea  <cit> , whereas rh08- <dig> has high field resistance to this pathogen that is inherited from the stem-type lettuce balady banha  <cit> .

eco <dig> proliferated to a significantly greater extent in diseased tissue  than on healthy tissue on both plant accessions . representative discs of healthy, chlorotic, and necrotic lettuce leaf tissue are shown in figure  <dig>  the extent of eco <dig> colonization of the healthy tissue was not dependent on accession  in any of the replicate experiments . although we did not attempt to assess specifically the endophytic eco <dig> population sizes in our study, this observation is in line with results from a previous study that failed also to detect an overall effect of lettuce cultivar on the degree of s. enterica endophytic colonization of leaves, despite a significant role of serovar-cultivar interactions  <cit> . on the other hand, eco <dig> metabolic activity during epiphytic and endophytic colonization of lettuce, as assayed with a lux reporter, varied in a cultivar-dependent manner, indicating that plant genotype may affect the human pathogens on the surface or inside healthy leaves  <cit> . thus, a range of scenarios remains to be explored regarding the role of cultivar in the contamination of healthy lettuce leaves by enteric pathogens.table  <dig>

cvalues in parenthesis are p values resulting from the t-test between rh and tt for the type of tissue within the experiment.


dvalues at the bottom of each column are p values resulting from anova on the different types of tissue within plant accession and experiment. different letters within column indicate means that are significantly different at p <  <dig> . significant differences were determined using the tukey- kramer procedure for multiple comparisons.



importantly, the eco <dig> population increase in diseased tissue in our study was significantly lower on lettuce line rh08- <dig> than on the more susceptible cultivar triple threat in all three replicate experiments  . this suggests that a plant factor linked to the dynamics or amount of tissue infection by b. lactucae affects the ability of the human pathogen to fully exploit these lesions for multiplication. the nature of this plant factor remains unclear. it is unlikely that the plant gene that contribute to the resistance of rh08- <dig> to b. lactucae infection directly inhibited the growth of eco <dig> in the lesions because this type of resistance is expected to be specific to b. lactucae-lettuce interactions. recently, chromosomal regions associated with broad-spectrum quantitative disease resistance to plant pathogens were identified  <cit> . it would be of great interest to determine if broad-spectrum disease resistance may be involved not only in plant interaction with plant pathogens but may be of use also to reduce plant colonization by human enteric pathogens.

expression of pr- <dig> in lettuce accessions
because basal immunity contributes to protection of plants against a broad range of insults, we tested the expression of the gene encoding the antimicrobial pr- <dig> protein in two lettuce accessions infected with b. lactucae. pr- <dig> is a major marker of the salicylic acid-mediated pathway of basal defense against microbial infection  <cit>  that is induced in plants also in response to oomycete infection  <cit> . both healthy and chlorotic leaf tissue were tested for pr- <dig> expression in the resistant line rh08- <dig> and in the susceptible cultivar triple threat. necrotic lesions do not yield sufficient mrna to allow for transcript measurement by qrt-pcr.

qrt-pcr analysis revealed that accession rh08- <dig> had significantly greater expression of pr- <dig> than cultivar triple threat . the high expression of this gene in the healthy rh08- <dig> tissue is likely caused by its systemic induction, since pr- <dig> is the hallmark of systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . thus, because the healthy tissue was sampled from leaves that harbored lesions at various stages of the disease, the defense signal induced by the oomycete actively infecting the leaf at other distant sites likely resulted in production of pr- <dig> in the healthy part of the same leaf. this accumulation of pr- <dig> may not have affected the growth of the human pathogen on the healthy tissue of the tested accessions since most, if not all, of the bacterial cell population was located on the leaf cuticle and therefore, did not have open access to the plant apoplast as did occur in the lesions. the general trend of pr- <dig> transcriptional activity agrees with a potential role of b. lactucae-induced basal immunity in the weaker eco <dig> colonization of lesions in rh08- <dig>  a different but not necessarily contradictory hypothesis, may be that eco <dig> benefited from an immuno-suppressive effect of b. lactucae on the cultivar triple threat, thereby experiencing an environment that enhanced its growth compared with the lesions in the more resistant rh08- <dig>  this type of symbiotic interaction was observed with co-inoculations of the plant pathogenic p. syringae pv. tomato dc3000Δhopq1- <dig> and s. enterica in nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> .figure  <dig>

lesion-mediated protection of eco <dig> from desiccation
bacterial cells in the phyllosphere frequently encounter periods of dry conditions when free water is not available on the plant surface  <cit> . given that eco <dig> cells can become embedded in the downy mildew-infected tissue and that the physicochemical properties of the damaged tissue itself may alter the microenvironment and the physiology of the human pathogen, we sought to determine if eco <dig> cells gained protection from desiccation stress on lettuce leaves by localization in b. lactucae lesions. our experimental set up, using cultivar green towers, simulated high relative humidity conditions  where free water remained at few locations on the leaves at the macroscopic level, and conditions of 65-75% rh where free water was absent from the leaf surfaces macroscopically. eco <dig> multiplied over the first  <dig> h after inoculation on healthy, chlorotic, and necrotic tissue under high rh, with the greatest increase observed in the necrotic lesions . the population sizes then decreased between  <dig> and  <dig> h post-inoculation, possibly because a certain proportion of the wet sites on the leaves dried up over time after inoculation. at the lower rh of 65-75%, eco <dig> populations declined on all types of tissue over time but remained proportionally the greatest in the necrotic lesions with a survival rate at  <dig> h post-inoculation of  <dig> % compared with  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the healthy and chlorotic parts of the leaf, respectively . it is noteworthy that under the lower rh, the eco <dig> cell numbers appeared to stabilize over time after an initial decrease in the necrotic tissue, suggesting that the human pathogen adapted to the conditions in that habitat either physiologically or by reaching protective niches. contribution of the bacterial plant pathogen, xanthomonas campestris pv. vitians to the persistence of eco <dig> on lettuce in the field, where low rh and water availability on the phylloplane may be important stressors during various times of the day has been reported  <cit> .figure  <dig>

our study is the first to determine the effect of downy mildew, an endemic disease of lettuce in a major vegetable production region of the usa, on the behavior of eco <dig> on this crop and to assess various factors that may enhance its persistence in infected leaves. given the great potential for multiplication and survival of eco <dig> in b. lactucae lesions on wet and dry leaves, respectively, and considering that large fluctuations in water availability to bacterial cells likely prevail on lettuce in the field, downy mildew disease may represent an important risk factor of microbial contamination. the higher prevalence of downy mildew on lettuce plants approaching harvest maturity may compound the risk of contamination associated with this disease. although most of the old lettuce leaves infected with downy mildew are trimmed off during harvest, a fraction of b. lactucae lesions escape visual detection. additionally, the proliferation and enhanced survival of eco <dig> in the infected tissue may create a reservoir from which the pathogen is disseminated or vectored to other sites in the field, as well as contribute to the persistence of the human pathogen in crop debris in the field. further investigation of the role of downy mildew in the colonization of lettuce by enteric pathogens under field conditions is warranted. additionally, our observation that eco <dig> survives and multiplies at different rates in comparable b. lactucae lesions of two accessions indicates that variability in lettuce gene pool may be explored to develop cultivars that are less hospitable to human enteric pathogens. such cultivars would be a vital part of an integrated strategy to minimize eco <dig> illness linked to lettuce contamination.

CONCLUSIONS
the massive proliferation of eco <dig>  under wet conditions in downy mildew lesions on lettuce leaves, and its enhanced persistence in this diseased tissue under conditions of lower rh, suggest that infection of lettuce by b. lactucae may increase the risk of microbial contamination of this crop. given that differences in eco <dig> colonization of diseased tissue were observed in two lettuce accessions with different levels of resistance to downy mildew, breeding lettuce for resistance to this disease may be worth exploring to decrease the burden of enteric illness due to contamination of lettuce.
