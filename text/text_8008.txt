BACKGROUND
despite many advances in diagnostics and therapeutics, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in women  <cit> . bone morphogenetic proteins  are a group of growth factors that are important players during development  <cit>  but also contribute to cancer formation and progression . as a subfamily of the transforming growth factor β  protein superfamily, bmps are extracellular ligands that bind as dimers to their specific transmembrane receptors and activate the intracellular smad signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of receptor-regulated smads . the activated smads bind to smad <dig> and the complex translocates to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of bmp target genes  <cit> . alternatively, bmp signals are also mediated through the activation of erk, jnk and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways  <cit> .

the functional consequences of bmp signaling depend on the bmp ligand and tissue type. we and others have shown that bmp <dig> reduces the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines, while simultaneously inducing migration and invasion in a subset of cell lines . similar dualistic effects upon bmp <dig> stimulation have also been reported in other tumor types  <cit> . concordantly, data from breast cancer patient samples point to a correlation between elevated bmp <dig> levels and reduced proliferation as well as an increased risk of recurrence  <cit> . these bmp4-related effects that seem either detrimental  or beneficial  for the cancer cells are likely to be mediated by specific bmp <dig> target genes. the identification of such target genes is thus important since it may allow generation of effective cancer therapies targeting each phenotype independently.

we have previously searched for bmp <dig> target genes in a set of breast cancer cell lines that predominantly respond to bmp <dig> treatment by reduction of proliferation  <cit> . here, we used next-generation sequencing  technologies  to uncover bmp4-mediated transcriptional events with a specific focus on comparing cells in which bmp <dig> has opposing effects, namely antiproliferative and promigratory. out of the nine breast cancer cell lines we have previously studied, t-47d shows one of the most prominent growth reductions and mda-mb- <dig> cells display the most overt induction of migration  <cit> , and were thus selected for this study.

rna-seq method quantifies the level of gene expression across the genome  <cit>  while dnase-seq allows identification of open chromatin regions that are sensitive to digestion by the dnase i endonuclease  <cit> . open chromatin regions are considered as sites where transcriptional regulation can take place since they are accessible for regulatory molecules to bind and exert their function. by combining data from rna-seq and dnase-seq, and using additional data analysis tools, it was possible to identify candidate transcription factors involved in the observed transcriptional responses. this approach thus provides the means to better understand the transcriptional events that link bmp <dig> signaling and its resulting phenotypes.

RESULTS
we performed rna-seq and dnase-seq analyses in two breast cancer cell lines, t-47d and mda-mb- <dig>  the cell lines were treated with bmp <dig> and vehicle control for 3 h, thus allowing us to specifically focus on early response events. both vehicle- and bmp4-treated cell lines were sequenced .

bmp4-elicited transcriptional regulation is highly divergent in the two breast cancer cell lines with different functional responses to bmp4
sequencing reads from rna-seq and dnase-seq were aligned to the human genome and further analyzed as described in the methods. to confirm that the two datasets were consistent, we compared the chromatin openness as determined by dnase-seq signal at the transcription start site  to the expression level of the gene as determined by rna-seq. as expected, we found that the increased openness of tss globally correlated with increased gene expression . however, the variance is high, indicating that the differences in the chromatin state only partly explain gene expression patterns.

next we compared the expression levels from rna-seq between the vehicle- and bmp4-treated cells. this analysis identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in mda-mb- <dig>  of which  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> downregulated . in t-47d, there were  <dig> degs, of which  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated . in total,  <dig> degs  were shared by the two cell lines and all of them were upregulated except gs1-124 k <dig>  which was downregulated in both cell lines. to illustrate that bmp <dig> induces markedly divergent transcriptional responses in these two cell lines, we generated a heatmap to show the expression levels of the protein-coding degs . using the dnase-seq data, we examined the chromatin status at the transcription start sites  of these protein-coding degs. for the majority of the cases the chromatin was open at the tss before bmp <dig> stimulation  . for the remaining degs, we observed either opening or closing of the tss after stimulation or no change in the closed chromatin status . these data indicate that, at this early time point, the bmp4-induced differential expression mainly involves genes whose transcription does not require changes in the chromatin status at tss.fig.  <dig> the rna-seq and dnase-seq data reveal cell line-specific responses to bmp <dig>  a gene expression levels of differentially expressed protein-coding genes converted to log <dig> scale are shown for both cell lines and treatments, upregulated genes on the left and downregulated genes on the right. the status column denotes the cell line in which the gene is differentially expressed. the rightmost columns indicate the status of the chromatin at transcription start sites  of the degs as measured by dnase-seq. b illustration of the differentially expressed components of the bmp signaling pathway upon bmp <dig> treatment




the deg lists included a number of genes involved in the canonical bmp pathway. as expected, id <dig>  id <dig> and id <dig>  known bmp <dig> target genes, were upregulated in both cell lines . similarly, the receptor-regulated smad <dig> was upregulated in both cell lines whereas no significant difference in the other receptor-regulated smads or smad <dig> expression was observed. among the inhibitory smads, smad <dig> was upregulated in both cell lines and smad <dig> in t-47d. in addition, the bmp type i receptor bmpr1a and negative regulators of bmp signaling, nog and bambi, were upregulated in t-47d while in mda-mb- <dig> their expression was not significantly changed . thus bmp <dig> stimulation leads to expression changes having characteristics of both feedback and feedforward loops.

we then evaluated whether the differentially expressed genes participate in specific biological processes and especially assessed whether the non-common degs have differing functions. to this end we used david to search for go terms enriched in the sets of non-common protein-coding degs. in mda-mb- <dig>  most of the enriched terms were related to cell migration whereas organ development and morphogenesis as well as intracellular signaling were the most significant go terms in t-47d . these findings imply that the transcriptional changes are indeed likely to explain the dissimilarities in the phenotypic responses of these two cell lines to bmp <dig> treatment.table  <dig> gene ontology analysis

the david functional annotation tools was used to reveal significantly enriched go categories among the differentially expressed protein-coding genes. the analysis was done independently for each cell line and shared differentially expressed genes were omitted. the top five biological function go terms are shown




thereafter, we also wanted to investigate whether the expression levels of degs could be linked with survival in breast cancer patients. for this purpose, we used the data publicly available in the tcga database. the results showed that  <dig> degs in the mda-mb- <dig> and  <dig> degs in the t-47d cells associated with either good or poor prognosis . of the nine shared protein-coding degs, four  were correlated with survival, all being associated with poor prognosis.

to validate the results of the rna-seq analysis and to extend the scope of the study beyond the 3 h time point in two cell lines, qrt-pcr was used to study the expression levels of  <dig> selected degs in mda-mb- <dig> and t-47d cells as well as in five additional breast cancer cell lines  and one normal breast epithelial cell line  treated with bmp <dig> and vehicle for  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h. the genes were selected based on their expression levels and reported cancer association in the literature, and five of these were upregulated according to the rna-seq in both mda-mb- <dig> and t-47d. the expression patterns of the majority of the genes showed similarities across the cell line panel and time points with the clear exception of mda-mb- <dig>  in which the expression changes were very limited . particularly the five shared genes  as well as dlx <dig> were consistently upregulated upon bmp <dig> treatment throughout the time series thus confirming that they represent common bmp <dig> target genes. the remaining genes showed more variability with altered expression typically in only two to three cell lines, suggesting that their expression is likely to be influenced by factors that are cell line-specific.fig.  <dig> expression levels of selected bmp <dig> target genes by qrt-pcr in a breast cancer cell line panel. the expression levels of  <dig> degs were measured after  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h of bmp <dig> treatment in the indicated cell lines. the color code illustrates the relative expression levels in the bmp4-treated sample as compared to the corresponding vehicle control. fc = fold change, n.a. = mrna level too low to allow reliable measurement




chromatin landscape and dynamics following bmp <dig> treatment
to gain more insight into the changes of chromatin structure during bmp <dig> treatment, we performed peak detection in a genome-wide manner to identify the areas of open chromatin. the peak detection approach was benchmarked by comparison to publicly available dnase-seq data of unstimulated t-47d cell line from encode , showing that most of the peaks identified in our data are present also in encode samples .

after filtering procedures , the numbers of identified dnase hypersensitive sites  in the mda-mb- <dig> cell line were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in vehicle- and bmp4-treated samples, respectively. in t-47d, the corresponding numbers were  <dig>  and  <dig> . to obtain a unified set of peaks for both conditions, the overlapping dhss were merged resulting in a total of  <dig>  dhss in mda-mb- <dig> and  <dig>  in t-47d. after the merging, the fraction of shared dhss between bmp <dig> and vehicle control in mda-mb- <dig> samples was 75% while the fraction of unique dhss in the vehicle was 9% and correspondingly in the bmp <dig> sample 16% . in the t-47d cell line, the fraction of shared dhss between the two conditions was 27% whereas the fraction of unique dhss in the vehicle was 34% and in the bmp <dig> sample 39% .

annotation of the merged dhss to genomic features revealed a similar distribution in the two cell lines in the vehicle-treated condition, with the largest fraction  of dhss locating in introns . when comparing the distributions of the bmp4-induced dhss between the cell lines apparent resemblances were also observed. in both cell lines, the proportion of dhss associated with intronic and intergenic regions increased after bmp <dig> stimulation with a corresponding decrease at other genomic locations, including the promoter regions .fig.  <dig> distribution of open chromatin regions. annotation of open chromatin regions in mda-mb- <dig> and t-47d after  vehicle treatment  and  bmp <dig> treatment 




to assess the functional impact of the bmp4-induced global changes in the chromatin structure we conducted an enrichment analysis using great  <cit>  which maps the dhss to putative regulatory regions of genes and conducts a gene ontology enrichment analysis. the results highlighted e.g. cell motility and organ morphogenesis as enriched biological functions for mda-mb- <dig> and t-47d, respectively . these results are consistent with those obtained by enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes from rna-seq  and thereby suggest that, together with specific target genes, bmp4-induced changes at chromatin level may contribute to the emergence of the different bmp4-mediated phenotypes.

transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis in open chromatin regions of promoters reveals transcription factors involved in bmp <dig> signaling regulation
based on our tss openness analysis , a dominant feature of our data is that the chromatin of the putative bmp <dig> target genes  is open already in vehicle-treated cells. this is further supported by our genome-wide peak analysis, where the promoter regions were not overrepresented after the treatment . therefore, the alterations in the chromatin state only partially explain gene expression differences induced by the bmp <dig> treatment. however, differential transcription factor binding to open promoters may explain the different responses in the cell lines. therefore we performed transcription factor  motif binding analysis. to assess which tfs might be regulators of the bmp <dig> response, the sequences of open chromatin sites in the proximal promoters of upregulated genes were analyzed with a total of  <dig> position weight matrixes , representing  <dig> individual tfs or tf-complexes . for each tf we calculated an enrichment score  for the number of binding sites in either mda-mb- <dig> or t-47d cells.

this analysis led to the identification of candidate regulator tfs, including multiple members of the smad family of tfs, as expected, as well as a number of shared common regulator tfs. to focus on biologically relevant candidates, we filtered out those tfs that were not expressed based on our rna-seq data. in addition, we included only those tfs whose binding sites  in open chromatin regions of the promoters of degs were enriched in one and depleted in the other cell line. the top  <dig> tfs that are expressed in both cell lines but have a high enrichment score only in one of the cell lines are listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  examples of target gene promoters with binding motifs for predicted tfs are shown in fig. 4a.table  <dig> top  <dig> transcription factors enriched in mda-mb- <dig> cells

for more in-depth functional analysis we selected particular tfs from the top enriched candidates using the following criteria: 1) a binding motif with a quality category of a-c in the hocomoco database, 2) relevance in the context of our model based on literature, 3) not a highly common regulator or part of a large tf family, and 4) high expression level of the tf  in at least one cell line and differential expression between cell lines according to the rna-seq. the last criteria was used to ensure methodological success in subsequent functional assays. with the criteria described above cbfb, hif1a, and mbd <dig> were selected for further study. of these, mbd <dig> had a large number of binding sites in the promoters of our degs while binding sites of the other two tfs were less widespread. in addition, smad <dig> was used as a positive control.

as smad <dig> is a known regulator of bmp signaling, we performed co-occurrence analysis of the binding sites between our three candidate tfs and the smad motifs. we found that the mbd <dig> motif was significantly co-localized with the gc-rich smad <dig> consensus motifs cgcc , gccgncgc , and ggcgcc . as binding sites for cbfb or hif1a were less frequent across degs, statistical significance for co-localization with smad motifs could not be reliably evaluated. however, we did find several promoters where smad binding sites co-localized with these factors.

silencing of selected tfs  was then used to further evaluate their impact on bmp <dig> signaling. after 48 h of silencing, the cells were treated with bmp <dig> for 24 h and the mrna levels of the validated degs were measured to assess whether the silencing influences bmp <dig> target gene expression . downregulation of smad <dig> was able to reverse the bmp4-mediated change in the expression of all the tested target genes in both mda-mb- <dig> and t-47d cells  indicating that these expression changes are indeed transmitted via the canonical bmp pathway. for most of the target genes, mbd <dig> silencing led to abrogation of the bmp4-mediated induction in gene expression in both cell lines. in t-47d cells, similar data was also obtained for most of the genes upon cbfb  and hif1a depletion . however in mda-mb- <dig>  silencing of hif1a resulted exclusively in upregulation of the target genes and both enhanced and diminished expression was seen after cbfb downregulation. of note, silencing of all of the tfs in t-47d cells led to the enhanced expression of the dll <dig> gene, which was consistent with it being downregulated upon bmp <dig> treatment. these data imply that the tfs may function as either repressors or enhancers of bmp <dig> target gene expression in a context-dependent manner.

discussion
we have previously characterized transcriptional responses of breast cancer cell lines to bmp <dig> by using microarray technology  <cit> . however, in that study we focused only on cells that respond to bmp <dig> by reduced proliferation. efforts by others to examine bmp signaling target genes have concentrated exclusively on non-cancerous cells . here we set out to uncover the transcriptional responses of breast cancer cell lines with different phenotypes by using one cell line that responds to bmp <dig> by reduced proliferation  and another that reacts with increased migration . being able to uncover the mechanisms of these two different responses is essential for the understanding of the role of bmp <dig> in breast cancer pathogenesis. to this end, we used a substantially new approach of combining dnase-seq, rna-seq and functional experiments.

in order to find the early mediators of bmp <dig> response, we treated the cells with bmp <dig> or vehicle control for 3 h. at this time point, the canonical bmp pathway through smad1/5/ <dig> is already activated  <cit> . the results of rna-seq revealed that the cell lines responded to bmp <dig> by upregulating or downregulating a set of genes that were mostly cell line-specific, with only ten common degs identified. consistent with the sequencing data, validation with qrt-pcr across multiple time points  and five additional cell lines further confirmed in a wider context the existence of common bmp <dig> target genes as well as cell line-specific expression patterns. of the ten shared degs, three were known bmp <dig> target genes  and two members of the bmp signaling pathway   <cit> . the activation of the inhibitory smad <dig> indicates a negative feedback loop, which in t-47d is reinforced by the upregulation of bmp antagonist nog and the pseudoreceptor bambi. on the other hand, activation of the receptor-regulated smad <dig> seems to point to a positive feedback loop, as alongside other r-smads, smad <dig> has been found to enhance bmp signaling  <cit> . however, one study indicated that smad <dig> may have an inhibitory role in bmp signaling  <cit> . in any case, upregulation of smad <dig> due to bmp <dig> treatment has also been recently reported in various cell types, for example in primary fibroblasts, hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma cells  <cit> .

to understand the function of the cell line-specific degs, we used go analysis to segregate the degs into biological process categories and discovered that the results reflected the response of the cell lines to bmp <dig>  processes related to migration were enriched in the mda-mb- <dig> cells, whereas more diverse responses were found in t-47d, including categories comprised of signaling, development and morphogenesis. these findings were corroborated by the dnase-seq data, where we found that bmp4-induced global open chromatin sites were enriched with the same biological categories that were found with rna-seq data. while categories associated with signaling were observed in both cell lines, in mda-mb- <dig> those related to migration were enriched. these data extend our previous results showing enrichment of differentially expressed genes in go categories that were associated with the bmp4-induced decrease in proliferation  <cit> . taken together, the different responses of the cell lines to bmp <dig> are reflected both at the transcriptional and chromatin levels.

in the analysis of tss chromatin state we could observe changes in only a few of the genes that were differentially regulated by bmp <dig>  this might be due to the fact that the 3 h stimulation of bmp <dig> is too short for most of the tsss to change their chromatin status. moreover, we could observe that in many cases the chromatin was already open at the tss, in which case further changes are not needed to enhance the transcriptional activity. together with the observation that there is a large variation between the chromatin status and gene expression when we extend the analysis to the whole set of protein-coding genes, it can be concluded that the chromatin state of tsss explains the observed expression patterns only to a small extent. this result was not unexpected, as gene expression is also commonly regulated from regions located far from the tss, such as enhancers  <cit> .

with genome-wide detection of open chromatin areas we noticed that bmp <dig> stimulation induces opening of the chromatin mostly in the intronic and intergenic regions. this is consistent with the fact that changes in the tss and promoter regions were observed with only a few of the differentially expressed genes. opening of the intronic sequences may indicate increased level of rna polymerase activity at gene bodies. chromatin opening at intergenic regions might suggest that additional regulatory control is being attained in large extent through distal regulatory elements such as enhancers and silencers. thus, already at the early 3-h time point we are able to observe conformational changes that cells may utilize in more detailed regulation of the bmp response. unfortunately, based on this analysis we were not able to define a specific transcription factor chromatin signature that could be used to define bmp-specific regulatory sequences. hence detailed analysis of the putative enhancer regions would require more specific measurement data about the chromatin interactions in these cells.

to further characterize the regulation of bmp <dig> target genes, we analyzed transcription factor binding sites  in the open chromatin regions located on gene promoters. among the top  <dig> enriched tfs, there were a few which had previously been linked to bmp target gene regulation. for example, xbp <dig> and rela have been shown to be repressors of bmp target genes xvent- <dig> and id <dig>  respectively  <cit> . using enrichment of the tfbss between cell lines as well as other criteria, we selected three tfs  for functional characterization and silenced them in the two cell lines. in addition, we used smad <dig>  a key component of the canonical bmp pathway, as our positive control and indeed smad <dig> was required for transcriptional regulation of all the bmp <dig> target genes in the assay. although bmps can signal through alternative pathways  <cit> , this result points to regulation through the canonical pathway. in contrast, the response to other transcription factors was more variable and cell line-specific.

mbd <dig> is a methyl-cpg-binding transcription factor that plays a role in development  <cit> . several studies have shown that mbd <dig> acts as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting co-repressor complexes to promoters, which in turn leads to formation of repressive chromatin through chromatin remodelling  <cit> . however, there is also evidence that mbd <dig> can activate transcription by removing methylation from cpg islands located in promoters  <cit> . in both cell lines, mbd <dig> seemed to act mainly as an activator of transcription, although its role was more prominent in mda-mb- <dig>  in our analysis, mbd <dig> had a large number of binding sites across degs and it was highly expressed in both cell lines, consistent with the observed behavior in the silencing experiment. the key role of mbd <dig> in controlling the bmp <dig> response suggests that dna methylation may be involved in bmp <dig> signaling.

the core-binding factor subunit beta  together with the alpha subunit  is involved in hematopoiesis and skeletal development  <cit> . it was generally an activator of transcription in t-47d cells where its binding sites were enriched at degs promoters, but showed a less constant role in mda-mb- <dig>  of note, cbfb has previously been found to influence bmp signaling in chondrocytes  <cit>  and it has also been shown to have invasive properties in breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cells  <cit> .

hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha  is a key regulator of the hypoxia response and has been linked to breast cancer progression  <cit> . in our binding site enrichment analysis, we observed that hif1a binding sites are strongly depleted in mda-mb- <dig> degs although hif1a has a very high expression in this cell line. we also found that hif1a was almost exclusively a transcriptional repressor of bmp <dig> target genes in mda-mb- <dig> cells, whereas in t-47d cells it had either no effect or acted as an activator of transcription. several hypoxia-related genes were found among degs, four in mda-mb- <dig> cells  and three in t-47d cells . interestingly, some of these genes have also been linked to cancer progression, for example hif1a-dependent upregulation of pdgfb and angptl- <dig> promotes metastasis of hypoxic breast cancer cells  <cit> . as an additional interesting aspect, hif1a has been shown to activate bmp <dig> transcription in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and in murine spleen and es cells . together these findings support the view that hif1a is indeed a cell type-specific repressor that controls a particular subset of bmp4-activated target genes.

CONCLUSIONS
by combining genome-wide computational analyses and experimental data with functional validation, we were able to extend our knowledge about bmp <dig> signaling in breast cancer. this study demonstrates that the differential responses to bmp <dig>  reduced proliferation and induced migration, seen in breast cancer cell lines in vitro, are reflected in the expression pattern of bmp <dig> target genes, thus allowing us to uncover regulatory mechanisms associated with these phenotypes.

by integration of chromatin state and transcription factor binding analyses with gene expression, we were able to identify candidate tfs involved in the regulation of bmp <dig> response. the function of these tfs was then tested by silencing experiments. from our three candidates, mbd <dig> emerged as a consistent activator of target gene expression in both cell lines, while hif1a was shown to act as a repressor in cells with induced migration phenotype and cbfb as an activator, particularly in cells with reduced proliferation phenotype.

while understanding the full complexity of the regulation of bmp <dig> signaling will require more extensive data, analyses and experiments in wider contexts, our current study established the existence of phenotype-specific bmp response patterns in gene expression. furthermore, we identified and experimentally validated cell type-specific downstream regulators of bmp signaling that relate to these expression patterns and thus to different in vitro phenotypes.
