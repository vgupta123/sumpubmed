BACKGROUND
contagious agalactia  is, along with bovine pleuropneumonia and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, one of the three mycoplasma-induced diseases affecting small ruminants which are notifiable to the world organisation for animal health due to their economic significance
 <cit> . ca is a syndrome clinically characterized by mastitis, arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis and occasionally abortion
 <cit>  and mycoplasma agalactiae is considered its major etiological agent. m. mycoides subsp. capri, m. capricolum subsp. capricolum and m. putrefaciens cause a clinically similar syndrome, particularly in goats
 <cit> . the syndrome causes major economic losses because of reduction or suppression of milk production, abortion, high morbidity and mortality rates, and costs associated with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention which are estimated to be above  <dig> million euros per year in the european countries forming the mediterranean basin
 <cit> .

ca has its major impact in the mediterranean countries, where the disease is considered to be endemic. however, it is also widely distributed in west asian countries, central, north and east african countries, the usa, and brazil
 <cit> . interestingly, the significance of the different mycoplasma species causing ca varies depending on the geographic area. in the united states, m. mycoides subsp. capri is the most prevalent caprine mycoplasma, although m. agalactiae has been recently isolated
 <cit> . in northern jordan, m. agalactiae and m. mycoides subsp. capri play the major role in both, sheep and goats
 <cit> . in france, m. agalactiae has reemerged in sheep flocks located in the basin of the western pyrénées, causing  <dig> new outbreaks in 2008
 <cit> . in spain, which has the second highest number of sheep amongst the  <dig> european union member states, research has been focused on caprine ca, and there is a knowledge gap regarding which mycoplasma species are present in sheep flocks from that country.

consequently, in the present study we aimed to assess for the first time the presence and geographic distribution of the four mycoplasma species causing ca, by analyzing raw milk samples from spanish dairy sheep farms by classical microbiological methods, and pcr-based methods which have been demonstrated to be specific and sensitive
 <cit> . the knowledge acquired will allow the implementation of appropriate control programs for those pathogens.

RESULTS
sensitivity of the pcr-based methods and capability to detect coinfected samples
artificially contaminated milk samples  inoculated with from  <dig> cells to  <dig> cells of each mycoplasma gave positive results by the three pcr-based systems
 <cit> . detection failed in the milk samples seeded with  <dig> cells . capability to detect samples co-infected with various ca-causing mycoplasmas was demonstrated in samples artificially contaminated with the  <dig> mycoplasma species analyzed in this study.

detection of ca-causing mycoplasmas in spanish sheep farms
all  <dig> milk samples tested negative for m. mycoides subsp. capri, m. capricolum subsp. capricolum and m. putrefaciens. on the other hand,  <dig> out of  <dig> dairy sheep farms were positive for m. agalactiae by real time pcr . furthermore, the pathogen was observed by microscopy identification in samples collected from  <dig> flocks . thereby, 411 m. agalactiae isolates were obtained.

we assessed the level of intermittent excretion of m. agalactiae during the sampling period using data obtained from other additional  <dig> farms sampled repeatedly from  <dig> to  <dig> times. in  <dig> % of the cases a previously positive farm resulted negative in a later sampling and conversely,  <dig> farms  tested negative in the first sampling but resulted positive in any of the subsequent samplings. overall,  <dig> of those sheep farms  were positive for m. agalactiae.

geographic distribution of flocks infected with mycoplasma agalactiae
positive farms for m. agalactiae were located in all eleven provinces sampled . the frequency ranged from  <dig> % to 100% of the flocks sampled per province revealing that the microorganism is widely distributed.

temporal distribution of mycoplasma agalactiae
the presence of m. agalactiae increased between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the minimum and maximum frequency of detection of m. agalactiae ranged from  <dig> % in february  <dig> to  <dig> % in may  <dig>  the months when the pathogen was most frequently detected were may  <dig> , july  <dig>  and october  <dig> . on the contrary, the lowest detection occurred in february  <dig> , june  <dig>  and april  <dig> . thereby,  <dig> out of  <dig> farms  were positive to m. agalactiae in spring ,  <dig> out of  <dig>  in summer ,  <dig> out of  <dig>  in autumn  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  in winter .

discussion
m. agalactiae was the only ca-causing mycoplasma detected in dairy sheep farms located in the study area, and it was found to be widely distributed as it was detected in all eleven provinces sampled . in contrast, although m. agalactiae has been detected with a high prevalence in spanish goat herds ranging from 40% to 66%
 <cit> , it seems that m. mycoides subsp. capri plays the major role in goat
 <cit> . interestingly, m. capricolum subsp. capricolum and m. putrefaciens have been recently isolated in goat herds located in the canary islands and extremadura  regions
 <cit> , and yet those pathogens have not been detected in sheep flocks from the study area suggesting that spanish dairy sheep are free of their presence or, at least, that their distribution would be restricted outside the sampling area. furthermore, in this study we have observed that the frequency of detection of m. agalactiae increased from  <dig> % in  <dig> to  <dig> % in  <dig>  suggesting that the pathogen has spread in the sampling area during the study period. on the other hand, we tried to establish relationships between the excretion of the microorganism in milk and the stages in sheep milk production  by analyzing the presence of m. agalactiae per month and per season in the different sampling years, but no pattern was found. we hypothesize that this is because the farms from the sampled region frequently had different production systems, and the same production stage may have occurred in a different time between farms.

to our knowledge, few surveys have been carried out internationally to determine which mycoplasma species are circulating in sheep. in northern jordan, investigations revealed a seroprevalence in sheep, goat and mixed flocks of 25%, 21% and 30% respectively, for m. agalactiae, and 32%, 38% and 34% for m. mycoides subsp. capri, suggesting that both microorganisms are widely distributed in that country and to the same extent in sheep and goats
 <cit> . this scenario is probably caused because in jordan more than 93% of sheep and goats are kept together in mixed farms, so both hosts are exposed to the same pathogens. in contrast, the existence of mixed farms in spain is not common, hindering the dissemination of other mycoplasma species from goat herds to sheep flocks.

detection of m. agalactiae by using microbiological techniques  greatly underestimated its presence in comparison to detection by using real time pcr . this finding prompts the recommendation that pcr-based methods should be routinely used in mycoplasma detection, as microbiological identification leads to underestimation due to the fastidious growth requirements of mycoplasmas, and serology is not a suitable method in those areas, such as spain, where systematic vaccination is extended.

the results of this study require careful interpretation. firstly, this syndrome follows a chronic course in endemic areas and the animals present an intermittent excretion of the microorganism in milk
 <cit> . therefore, the presence of m. agalactiae could have been underestimated, as samples were collected from the milk tanks. in fact, the findings obtained in this study suggest a high level of intermittent excretion, as in more than 26% of the re-sampled farms a previously positive flock tested negative in a later sampling and  <dig> % overall tested positive. considering that m. agalactiae is a highly persistent pathogen, remaining in the animals for years
 <cit> , and that it is very difficult to eliminate from infected herds, we can assume that in most of those cases infected animals were not excreting the pathogen at the sampling time or that the number of bacteria present was below the limit of detection. consequently, if monitoring of a herd needs be implemented, the inclusion of other suitable type of samples  is strongly recommended. secondly, the lower sensitivity of the conventional-pcr technique in comparison to the real time pcr could have underestimated the presence of the mycoplasma species detected by the first method. notwithstanding, all ca-causing mycoplasmas were detected after the inoculation of from  <dig> to  <dig> cells of each mycoplasma spp. in  <dig> ml milk samples. detection failed in samples containing  <dig> cells  probably because the initial amount of mycoplasmas was not enough to compete during the enrichment step with all the other microbiota present in the milk samples. this suggests that all the pcr systems can detect the minimum quantity of mycoplasmas needed for growing in the enrichment step, and therefore that the presence of the mycoplasma species as detected by conventional pcr would not be underestimated in detriment of the species detected by real time pcr. in addition, these results confirm that the enrichment step does not favor any species to the detriment to the others, and therefore that we can detect co-infected samples.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides for the first time an overview of the presence of ca-causing mycoplasmas circulating in spanish dairy sheep farms. m. agalactiae was the only species detected in the study area showing a high frequency of presence, and it was found to be widely distributed. the high frequency of detection of the pathogen supports the implementation of control and prevention measures to hinder the dissemination of m. agalactiae and to prevent the entrance of other mycoplasma species, such as systematic laboratory detection, isolation or slaughtering of infected flocks and tracing of livestock exchange.
