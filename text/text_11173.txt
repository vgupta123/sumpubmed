BACKGROUND
in the past two decades, advances in gene manipulation technologies have been applied widely in different aspects of molecular research, and have been especially useful in the functional analysis of genes. the analysis of mutant organisms generated by molecular modification is important in determining the functions of the wild-type genes. homologous recombination in bacterial systems is the main tool for investigation of gene function, and enables the generation of targeted mutants of almost any gene. these techniques have increased our ability to investigate the temporal control of gene knockdown, analyze mutations, and express proteins through targeted gene “knock in” into another gene. other than transposon mutagenesis and site–specific mutations, two other methods are widely used for functional analysis of bacterial genes: insertion duplication mutagenesis  and in-frame deletion   <cit> . comparison of a parental bacterial strain and its isogenic knockdown  or knockout  mutant, generated using these techniques, may reveal its specific function.

idm has been widely used in the study of virulence genes such as pneumolysin  and autolysin  in streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> . in this method, a partial target gene is amplified and ligated into a vector with a resistance marker. the constructed plasmid containing the chimeric dna sequence then undergoes homologous recombination with the target chromosomal region following transformation. integration and linearization, followed by insertion of the complete plasmid into the target gene, occurs in a single crossover between the two homologous gene sequences. as a result, the function of the target gene is disrupted  <cit> .

the other approach is ifd, which is a replacement homologous recombination  <cit> . unlike idm, in which the insertion construct is integrated into the homologous site of the target gene, ifd is preceded by a double cross-over event, leading to the complete replacement of the target gene. as a result, none of the sequence is duplicated in the recombinant, and the wild-type gene cannot be regenerated.

although both methods, which have been widely used in virulence studies in s. pneumoniae, can achieve the goal of gene disruption, no studies have compared whether the experimental data produced by idm are akin to that produced by ifd. in this study, the stability of idm and ifd was evaluated. we also examined whether target gene restoration  could occur in either type of mutant.

RESULTS
confirmation of s. pneumoniae idm-ply and -lyta mutants
three sets of pcr primers were used to confirm the correct formation of idm-ply mutants . positive dna fragments were observed for idm-ply using the ply-p2/pva891-f and ply-p1/pva891-r primer set. as expected, no amplification was observed with the ply-p1/ply-p <dig> primer set . bands were amplified from wild-type  strain d <dig> using the ply-p1/ply-p <dig> primer set, but not with the ply-p2/pva891-f and ply-p1/pva891-r primer set .

incorporation of pevp3-chloramphenicol , carrying a partial lyta sequence, into target chromosomal lyta by homologous recombination, generating a idm-lyta mutant, was confirmed using three pcr primer sets . dna fragments were obtained from idm-lyta using the lyta-p2/pevp3-f and lyta-p1/pevp3-r primer set. no dna amplification was observed from idm-lyta dna using the lyta-p1/lyta-p <dig> primer set . positive dna fragments were only obtained from wt d <dig> dna using the lyta-p1/lyta-p <dig> primers, while no amplification was observed using the lyta-p1/pevp3-r and lyta-p2/pevp3-f primer sets .

confirmation of s. pneumoniae ifd-ply and -lyta mutants
by transformation of linear dna fragments comprising the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of ply or lyta , respectively, into idm-ply and -lyta, ifd-ply and -lyta mutants were obtained from a second round of homologous recombination. both ifd mutants were confirmed by pcr using primer sets ply-p1/ply-p <dig> for pneumolysin and lyta-p1/lyta-p <dig> for autolysin . wt strain d <dig> was used as a control. predicted pcr products are shown in table  <dig>  a 670-bp and a 616-bp fragment were obtained for the ifd-ply and ifd-lyta mutants, respectively, using the same primer pairs as above, while positive amplification of d <dig> produced a 1824-bp fragment for ply and a 1346-bp fragment for lyta .

detection of tgr in idm and ifd mutants by pcr
tgr was identified in both the idm-ply and -lyta mutants, while no tgr was found in either the ifd-ply or -lyta mutants . wt ply, formed by tgr in idm-ply, was observed 4–5 h post-inoculation of mutants into plain brain-heart infusion  broth under antibiotic selection . this restoration of mutants back to the wt genotype increased to a plateau at about 8–10 h of cultivation, with or without antibiotic selection . the highest percentage increase in ply detection, relative to the earliest detection of tgr , in plain bhi and bhi with erythromycin  was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, indicating a relatively slow rate of tgr under antibiotic selective pressure . tgr was also observed in idm-lyta mutants . in bhi medium, tgr was first detected at around 5 h post-inoculation and corresponded to a 6-fold change in detection, while in bhi supplemented with cat, tgr was detected at 3 h post-inoculation and corresponded to a 90-fold change in detection .

validation of tgr from the results of previous pcr assay of idm mutants by using real-time pcr assay, southern blot hybridization and western bloting
since only ply antibody is commercial available for the determination of protein expression for tgr strain, validation of tgr from the results of the above pcr assay was used the ply as a model. in real time pcr assays, full length ply expression level of day  <dig> and day  <dig> culture of idm-ply was compared 8-h culture of idm-ply. a  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds were respectively observed in day  <dig> and day  <dig> culture of idm-ply indicating tgr of ply occurred as time dependent manner . in southern blotting, erm susceptible isolates were selected from day  <dig> culture of idm-ply and hybridization with ply specific probe confirmed that tgr wild type strains was occurred . for determination of full length protein expression of ply, western blotting was performed and confirmed that the ply expression in tgr was as same as wild type d <dig> .

effect of tgr on virulence of mutants in a mouse model of infection
for the in-vivo studies, mice were randomly selected and sacrified for detection of ply and lyta by pcr. no mice showed symptoms of illness at 10 min post-injection , and neither the wt d <dig> nor the idm mutant strain was found in the heparinized blood or liver at this time point . however, full-length ply was consistently detected in the blood and liver of animals injected with idm mutants grown with or without antibiotics at day  <dig> , and full length lyta was also detected as early as day  <dig> . idm-ply and -lyta were consistently detected in all samples on day  <dig>  indicating the coexistence of idm mutants and tgr wt d <dig> during infection .

approximately  <dig> colony forming units  of idm-ply mutant was then used in a lethality test. the median survival time of mice injected with a 3-h idm-ply culture was significantly longer than that of animals injected with an 8-h idm-ply culture:  <dig> versus 2 days, p =  <dig> , without antibiotic selection;  <dig> versus  <dig>  days, p =  <dig> , with erm selection . following ip injection of a 3-h idm-ply culture grown with and without antibiotics, five and four animals, respectively, out of  <dig> survived after 14 days of observation. all except one mouse  died within 14 days when an 8-h idm-ply culture was used. the survival time following injection with a 3-h idm-ply culture was significantly longer  than that with an 8-h culture of wt d <dig>  indicating decreased virulence of the 3-h idm-ply mutant. a comparable survival rate was observed between wt d <dig> and an 8-h idm-ply culture , indicating a high level of tgr in the 8-h idm-ply culture.

similarly, the median survival time of mice subjected to ip injection with 102 cfu of a 3-h culture of idm-lyta was significantly longer than that following injection with the same amount of an 8-h idm-lyta culture  . the survival rates for the two groups were 50% and 40%, respectively, at 14 days post-inoculation. none of the mice survived longer than 3 days post-inoculation with an 8-h culture of idm-lyta. like the idm-ply mutant, the 3-h idm-lyta culture had attenuated virulence in mice, demonstrated by a decreased mortality rate , when compared to the 8-h d <dig> culture. overall, the 3-h idm mutants were less virulent than the 8-h idm mutants. the survival of mice injected with 8-h idm-ply or -lyta culture was almost identical to that of mice injected with wt d <dig> 

discussion
a search of the literature shows that idm is still a commonly used method for gene kd  <cit> , and has been used to study pneumolysin and autolysin in s. pneumoniae <cit> . in the present study, tgr in idm mutants caused by intra-chromosomal recombination of a mutated target gene, was confirmed and significantly affected lethality in mice. selective antibiotic pressure minimized the extent of the tgr but could not completely eliminate the rearrangements. higher concentrations of antibiotics could prohibit reversion, but the growth rate of the bacteria was significantly affected. re-circularization of inserted sequence within the idm mutants circumvents the antibiotic selection. this type of mutant maintains its antibiotic resistance but loses the kd function of the target gene. following injection of these mutants into mice, antibiotic selective pressure is relaxed, leading to an increased chance of tgr. this event was observed in our animal study, in which tgr-d39-type ply and lyta gene sequences were detected at days  <dig> and  <dig> post-injection, respectively . this effect generated the discrepancy in pathogenicity and lethality in mice, and affects the interpretation of results in our study .

a previous study also showed decreased survival of mice injected ip with idm-ply compared with those injected with ifd-ply <cit> . the median survival times of mice injected with idm-ply  and ifd-ply  were  <dig>  and  <dig>  days, respectively, with a p-value of  <dig>  , suggesting that the idm-ply mutants were significantly different from the ifd-ply mutants, and were more virulent. polar effects of the pva891-mediated idm event, along with toxicity of truncated pneumolysin polypeptides or fusion proteins resulting from insertion of the plasmid sequences into the ply gene cannot be excluded  <cit> . our data proved that the relatively greater virulence of the idm mutants in the mouse model may also due to tgr. the restoration of the wt gene is not specific to ply or plasmid pva <dig>  as it also occurred with the virulence gene lyta and plasmid pevp <dig>  we have previously observed this phenomenon in gram-negative bacteria when we applied idm to kd ompk <dig>  an outer membrane porin gene of klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> . nonetheless, this gene restoration effect is not common to all genes. no target gene restoration was observed in idm-wzykpk <dig>  a capsule synthesis polymerase gene in k. pneumoniae <cit> . our pcr analysis of tgr of lyta idm mutants showed that tgr could be detected at as early as 3-h post-inoculation, supporting the discrepancy in results when an 8-h culture was selected for injection. our study of lethality showed that the median survival time  of mice when using the 8-h idm mutants was comparable to direct ip injection of the original d <dig> strain. we postulated that the idm mutants could revert to their parental characteristics, resulting in wt levels of virulence .

based on our previous experience with idm-ompk <dig>  tgr most likely occurred at a certain time during culture in broth medium, and the effect would not be detectable at culture times of less than 2 h  <cit> . however, the consequence of not using serial passages of such mutants has given rise to huge inconsistencies in the data. because the growth rate of s. pneumoniae is significantly slower than many other gram-positive bacteria in culture media, the problems associated with the unstable mutation become substantial when attempting to generate a considerable concentration of the mutant. although this difficulty can be overcome by pcr confirmation prior to the use of cultured mutants in each experiment, it becomes labor intensive in in vivo studies.

in addition to the other known defects of idm methods, tgr should be confirmed to avoid inconsistent results prior to interpretation and reporting. misinterpretation of data due to tgr may have contributed to important biological meaning being overlooked. if inconsistencies are observed in idm-related experimental data, previous data should be retrieved and examined for the possibility of tgr. however, the polar effect, truncated target polypeptides or fusion proteins resulting from insertion of the plasmid sequences of idm are always the consideration of this method even tgr will not be occurred. the use of ifd to generate mutants in both our previous work  <cit>  and the present study has given consistent data for both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
ifd is a superior kd method compared with idm, as it produces more stable clones, even though the success rate is lower.
