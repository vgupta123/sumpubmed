BACKGROUND
tightly controlled inducible expression of transfected genes greatly aids functional studies in relevant biological systems. the ability to regulate both the level and the duration of expression allows the study of proteins whose constitutive expression might not be tolerated by the cell. a number of inducible systems endogenous to mammalian cells involving regulation by heavy-metals  <cit> , steroid hormones  <cit> , heat shock  <cit>  and other reagents have been developed  <cit> . however, there are limitations with these inducible mammalian promoters such as "leakiness" of the "off" state and pleiotropic effects of inducers   <cit> . the use of insect hormones  has been proposed in an attempt to reduce the interference with cellular processes in mammalian cells  <cit> . another elegant system uses rapamycin as the inducer  <cit>  but the role of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant was a major limitation to its use in vivo and therefore it was necessary to find a biologically inert compound  <cit>  for the control of gene expression.

as an alternative, the control elements from the tetracycline resistance operon from e. coli were harnessed for gene regulation in mammalian cells. in its original configuration, an artificial promoter was rendered responsive to a chimaeric transactivator  fused to the vp <dig> activation domain), by linking the seven repeats of the tet operator sequence to the minimal promoter elements of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene  promoter. transcription from the tet promoter is activated by tta whose binding to dna is inhibited by tetracycline or by the rtta whose binding to dna is induced by tetracycline. the specificity of the interaction of tetr with the operator sequence, the large induction levels, the extensive studies on the safety of tetracycline and its high affinity for the tetr made this an attractive system  <cit> . since the original report of the tet switch, a number of modifications have been reported. these include the use of a repressor to block basal transcription  <cit>  and the fusion of a repression domain to the tetr to generate a silencer molecule  <cit> . furthermore, hofmann et al.  <cit>  have shown that use of a modified mouse mammary tumor virus promoter  instead of the minimal cmv promoter in the tet switch results in a lower basal activity in the absence of transactivator. baron et al.  <cit>  reported that cells better tolerate a modified tta, wherein the vp <dig> activation domain is truncated. a first generation reverse mutant was isolated in a bacterial screen and more recently a screen in saccharomyces cerevisiae has led to the identification of rtta molecules with improved regulatory properties . these and other modifications have made the tet switch the most widely used inducible system in mammalian cells  <cit> .

however, there is a need for additional systems for the control of gene expression in mammalian cells as evidenced by several recent reports of new systems  <cit> . it is not only desirable but necessary to have a wide variety of regulatory systems since an increasing number of applications benefit from the possibility of controlling simultaneously but independently, the expression of several genes  <cit> . others may require generating combinatorial control systems that would enable, for instance, the functional characterization of gene products involved in cascades  <cit>  such as signal transduction or control of programmed cell death. all of these require the use of several compatible gene regulation systems. thus, following the paradigm of the tetr, other microbial repressors regulating antibiotic resistance operons, have been developed by fussenegger and co-workers  <cit> . both the stretogramin- and macrolide-based gene switches have been shown to be efficient in vitro and in vivo and fully compatible with the tet switch. combination of these gene switches now allows for sophisticated multilevel gene regulation in mammalian cells  <cit> .

the bacterial repressor we have chosen to use as a base for developing our system controls expression from the p-cmt and p-cym operon in pseudomonas putida  <cit> . it has a deduced molecular weight of  <dig>  daltons. by sequence comparison, it has been proposed that the dna-binding domain is located in the n-terminus of the protein and has the characteristics of a helix-turn-helix motif. dna sequence analysis of the promoter regions   of the p-cym and p-cmt operons, reveal an imperfect and a perfect inverted repeat  respectively with characteristics of a binding site for a helix turn helix dna-binding domain  <cit> . the imperfect repeat is located between the promoter and the beginning of the first gene in the p-cymene degradative pathway. this gene codes for cumic alcohol dehydrogenase, which is responsible for the conversion of p-cymene to p-cumate. a similar sequence is found in the promoter region of the da gene, which is first in the degradative pathway of p-cumate. since cymr regulates expression from the p-cym and p-cmt operons, both sequences have been defined as putative operator sequences .

we have exploited cymr and cuo to control gene expression in mammalian cells using three different strategies .

1) repressor configuration: cymr was used to repress transcription from a mammalian promoter by binding an operator site  placed downstream of the initiation site. addition of the inducer  to mammalian cells causes a change in the configuration of cymr such that it can no longer bind dna and thus relieves repression .

2) activator configuration: cymr was fused to an activation domain and the chimaeric molecule  was used to activate transcription from a minimal promoter downstream of multimerized operator binding sites . again binding of cta, and therefore activation, is regulated by addition of cumate .

3) reverse activator configuration: rcymr was fused to vp <dig> to give rise to the chimaeric molecule  which was used to activate transcription from a minimal promoter downstream of multimerized operator binding sites . binding of rcta, and therefore activation, is induced by addition of cumate .

in this report we describe the generation and testing of the three different configurations of the switch in transient and stable transfectants.

RESULTS
the repressor configuration
transient transfections
to assess the potential of the regulatory elements of the p-cymene operon for regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells, we first examined the ability of cymr to down-regulate the expression of a strong viral promoter  in mammalian cells . the cymr coding sequence was therefore cloned in an expression vector  downstream of the cmv <dig> promoter to generate padcmv5-cymr.  <dig> cells were co-transfected with padcmv5-cymr, and with, either padcmv5-cuos-lacz wherein, expression from cmv <dig> can be blocked by the binding of cymr to cuo inserted at the asci site at the start site of transcription  or padcmv5-cuog-lacz, wherein cuo is inserted  <dig> bases downstream of the tata box . fig. 2a shows that when the reporter construct is transfected alone, high-level expression is detected . it is important to note that these levels are comparable to those from a parental construct, padcmv5-lacz, lacking the operator site . on co-transfection with the plasmid padcmv5-cymr, 95% of the activity is blocked by cymr expression . in addition, repression is totally relieved upon the addition of cumate . similar results are seen when the operator site is introduced in the age i site in the reporter construct  . in all subsequent dna constructs, the configuration corresponding to padcmv5-cuos-lacz was used and the position is no longer specified with a suffix.

stable expression in  <dig> cells
having observed tight control in transient transfections, we determined whether expression could be similarly regulated in cell lines stably expressing cymr. therefore the cymr coding sequence was cloned into an expression plasmid, pmpg-tk-neo, containing an expression cassette for the neomycin resistance gene.  <dig> cells were transfected with pmpg-cymr/tk-neo and a pool of g418-resistant cells were isolated. to screen for clones that expressed levels of cymr optimal for tight regulation, they were infected with adcmv5-cuos-lacz reporter adv  and lacz expression was measured in the absence and presence of cumate . the degree of repression varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold. in general, clones that showed a high degree of repression were more difficult to activate and vice versa. 293cymr-clone  <dig> was identified as one that exhibits a combination of efficient repression  and activation. it was thus chosen for the next step, which was to express the reporter construct stably.

a reporter plasmid, padcmv5-cuo-gfp, containing a gfp expression cassette wherein gfp expression is regulated by the cmv5-cuo promoter, was stably expressed in 293cymr clone  <dig> to generate 293cymr-cmv5-cuo-gfp clones. figure 2c shows the performance of the switch in such a configuration using one of the clones generated. in the on state, most cells displayed strong gfp fluorescence, whereas in the off state, only two cells were visible with fluorescence microscopy although the phase contrast image shows a dense cellular monolayer. the fluorescence index  was measured in the on  and off  states by flow cytometry. the on/off ratio for this clone was  <dig> 

the activator configuration
transient transfections
to transform cymr into a transactivator, it was fused to the vp <dig> activation domain such that this chimaeric molecule could activate transcription by binding multimerized cuo elements  upstream of a minimal promoter . to this end, the sequences coding for this chimaeric molecule  were cloned into an expression vector, padcmv5-k7-bfp giving rise to padcmv5-cta, where expression of cta is controlled by the cmv <dig> promoter. to test the system, padcmv5-cta was co-transfected with a reporter, padcr5-lacz wherein six repeats of the operator sequence are placed upstream of the cmv minimal promoter. reporter and activator constructs were co-transfected into either  <dig>  hela, a <dig> or bmade <dig>  cells. fig. 3a shows that the reporter construct, padcr5-lacz, when transfected alone, produced minimal amounts of β-gal activity. on co-transfection with the plasmid coding for the transactivator, there was a large increase in the β-gal activity. addition of cumate to the medium reduced the activation to different extents in the various cell lines, resulting in on/off ratios of  <dig>  +/-  <dig> ,  <dig> +/-  <dig> ,  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  in  <dig>  a <dig>  bmade1- <dig>  and hela cells respectively. both operator sequences  perform equally well to mediate transactivation , therefore all subsequent experiments were performed with the multimerized p <dig> elements linked to the cmv tata box .

stable expression in  <dig> cells
the cta hybrid gene was cloned into an expression plasmid, pcdna, containing an expression cassette for the neomycin resistance gene.  <dig> cells were transfected with pcdna-cta and a pool of g418-resistant cells were isolated. less than  <dig> clones were obtained, which were screened by infection with adcr5-lacz reporter adv . clone  <dig> was chosen for the highest level of activity and the best on/off value, and further sub-cloned by limiting dilution. reporter gene activity in  <dig> of the sub-clones were close, varying between  <dig>  and  <dig> . clone 30– <dig> has the best on/off ratio  and was thus chosen for further experimentation. it is noteworthy that, following adenoviral infection in  <dig> cells, the expression cassette is amplified to greater than 10e <dig> copies per cell and, as a result, the basal level of expression from the minimal promoter is fairly high as reported earlier  <cit> . therefore the efficacy of the cta to affect tight regulation from the cr <dig> promoter was further examined under low copy number as is the case in stable expression systems. thus the selected 293cta clone  was transduced with reporter lentivirus, lenti-cr5-gfp, wherein gfp expression is regulated by the cr <dig> promoter, giving rise to 293cta-cr5-gfp pool. reporter gene expression of the 293cta-cr5-gfp was studied in comparison to 293cymr-cmv5cuo-gfp for dose response to cumate as follows.

dose response of the repressor and activator configurations
to determine whether the control of gene expression was dose-dependent, cell lines stably expressing the repressor  or activator  configurations of the switch were cultured under conditions where gene expression is off . it is important to keep gene expression off while isolating a cell line stably expressing a gene of interest, because the expression of certain proteins may interfere with cell growth and thus with the process of isolating stable clones. to initiate the experiment, cells were washed and incubated in different concentrations of cumate. gfp expression was measured by flow cytometry,  <dig> h later. in the case of 293cymr-cmv5-cuo-gfp gfp fluorescence was almost at background levels  =  <dig>  fluorescence index =  <dig> ) without the addition of cumate . upon the addition of  <dig> μg/ml of cumate 93% of the cells are gfp +, with a mfi of  <dig> , giving a fluorescence index of  <dig>  further addition of cumate increases the mfi to  <dig>  and  <dig>  at  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml cumate respectively. at  <dig> μg/ml, the switch is maximally activated, since further addition of cumate  does not result in any significant increases in mfi . the maximal on/off ratio is thus  <dig> 

in the 293cta-cr5-gfp cell pool generated by lentiviral transduction of the reporter, the switch is maximally on,  <dig> % cells being gfp+ with an mfi of  <dig>  without the addition of cumate  and ). upon the addition of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml of cumate 46%, 38%, 19%, 9%, 6%, 5%, 3% and 2% of the cells are gfp +, with mfis of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. at  <dig> μg/ml, the switch is completely off, since additional increases in the cumate concentration does not cause a significant reduction in, either the percentage of gfp+ cells or the mfi. the maximal on/off ratio is thus  <dig> 

reverse activator configuration
to further increase the versatility of the cumate switch, we undertook a screen of cymr mutants to isolate a variant that would bind dna in the presence rather than the absence of cumate. we chose to perform the screen in mammalian cells using an adenoviral vector for delivery of the mutant library  <cit> .

screening an adenoviral library of cymr mutants
generating host cell line: 293cr5-lacz
in order to efficiently screen the library of the mutated transactivator, cta, a stable  <dig> cell line with optimized sensitivity for cumate induction was established by stable expression of a β-galactosidase reporter, padcr5-lacz-neo in  <dig> cells. fig. 5a shows the reporter activity of  <dig> of the resulting g418-resistant clones when infected with an adv expressing the transactivator  in the presence and absence of cumate. of the more than  <dig> clones screened, clone  <dig> was retained for further analysis since it displayed both a strong level of induction and the best on/off ratio . as shown in fig. 5b, when adcmvcta was plated on 293cr5-lacz at 100– <dig> plaques per plate, the plates are clearly white in the presence of cumate and blue in the absence of cumate as a result of β-galactosidase expression.

screening the adenoviral library
error prone pcr was used to generate a library of mutated cymr molecules. three pcr products with varying levels of nucleotide mis-incorporation, ranging from 0– <dig> to 7– <dig> mutations/kb were obtained and subcloned into plasmid padpscmv-cta-dc-gfp, where they replaced the wild-type cymr. thus three different libraries with varying frequencies of mutations, each with approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> recombinant e. coli clones, were established. the plasmid pools were used as transfer vectors to generate adenoviral libraries using the positive selection system  <cit> .

the library was plated on 293-cr5-lacz cells in the presence and absence of cumate, to screen for plaques that were β-galactosidase positive in the presence of cumate as opposed to the wild-type cta where plaques are β-galactosidase positive in the absence of cumate. approximately  <dig>  plaques were screened. however, only  <dig> gave the desired phenotype and were therefore picked for analysis. of these, the majority were not regulated by cumate. only one mutant satisfied the criteria for being a reverse mutant.

the reverse activator in transient transfections
the mutated cymr sequence was amplified from the viral dna and cloned into padcmv5cta replacing the wild type cymr to give rise to padcmv5rcta. sequence comparison of the wild-type and mutated dna revealed three mutations  in the 3'-half of the cdna.

transient transfections were performed to further characterize the reverse phenotype of the mutated cymr fig. 6). as seen in fig. 6a, whereas β-galactosidase activity is induced in the absence of cumate in the case of the cta, it is induced in the presence of cumate, in the case of the rcta. quantitation of the transfection results are shown in fig. 6b. the rcta activates transcription in the presence of cumate, with an on/off ratio of  <dig>  the cta, on the other hand, regulates transcription more efficiently, with an on/off ratio of  <dig>  despite the fact that it can activate to higher levels .

regulation of expression of the reverse activator
although the mutant has the desired phenotype, we wanted to explore the possibility of improving its ability to regulate gene expression. we thus regulated the expression of the rcta using a strategy that is illustrated in fig. 7a. we hypothesized that in the absence of cumate, cymr would block the expression of rcta from the plasmid padcmv5-cuo-rcta, maintaining reporter gene expression from the rcta-dependent padcr5-lacz, at minimal levels. in the presence of cumate, however, both the expression and the activation function of the rcta should be induced and reporter gene expression will be at maximal levels. to experimentally verify the advantage of this strategy, two cell lines stably expressing rcta were generated. a lentiviral vector expressing the rcta under the control of the cmv5-cuo promoter was used to transduce the parental  <dig> cells and a clone of  <dig>  that stably expresses cymr, thus regulating expression from the cmv <dig> promoter . the two cell pools  were sub-cloned by limiting dilution. the level of reporter gene expression upon lentiviral infection of representative 293rcta and 293cymr-rcta clones with lenticr5-gfp is shown in fig. 7b and 7c respectively. the superior level of regulation in the 293cymr-rcta sub-clones is evident. to better assess the induction factor, seap was subsequently used as a reporter since it allows for more precise measurements than gfp in cases of low-level expression, such as un-induced conditions. 293-cymr-rcta# <dig> and 293rcta# <dig> were retained for transduction with a lentiviral reporter . for the sake of comparison,  <dig> cells stably expressing the cta  were also transduced with the same reporter lentivirus. by monitoring gfp expression, the three pools were deemed to contain a similar percentage of transduced cells . the results for the three cell pools are shown in fig. 7d, which demonstrated a significant increase in the on/off ratio by regulating the expression of the rcta. the data also shows that the double regulation result in superior induction factor  as compared to the 293-rcta due to significant reduction in basal level under un-induced condition.

discussion
we have described the construction of a new inducible system for expression in mammalian cells. we have adapted the regulatory mechanism of a bacterial operon derived from pseudomonas putida to a mammalian expression system using three different strategies . since cumate is the effector molecule that regulates the cymr-mediated expression and therefore cymr-dna binding, it is the molecule we have used to regulate expression from the mammalian expression system incorporating cymr. it is important to note that, at concentrations that effectively control gene expression, mammalian cell growth is not affected over  <dig> passages .

the different strategies we have chosen to build an inducible system for expression in mammalian cells have been used before and have proven to be highly successful  <cit> . this approach is particularly attractive because it lends itself very well to improvement as a consequence of its modular nature. a very well studied example of a chimaeric transactivator is the tta where the tet repressor has been transformed into an activator by fusion with the vp <dig> activation domain  <cit> . the repressor is fused to an activation domain, the two modules being functionally independent. it is possible thus to improve and exchange the activation domain without affecting repressor function. modifications in the vp <dig> transactivation domain have been identified that render it less toxic, while maintaining its activation potential  <cit> . it is similarly possible to modify the dna-binding or dimerization properties of the repressor and leave the transactivation function unchanged  <cit> . a large number of such improvements have been described for the tet system in the literature . more recently, macrolide- and streptogramin-based gene-switches were also modified so as to render them more versatile  <cit> .

in the first strategy cymr is used as a repressor that reversibly blocks expression from a strong promoter. the operator sequence was inserted at two different sites with respect to the tata box since there is some debate in the literature as to the role of site of insertion. a detailed study by hu and davidson wherein lac operator sequences are inserted at different positions in the sv <dig> promoter region, indicates that in all cases there is a decrease in promoter activity due to the insertion per se  <cit> . more recently, hedengren-olcott and hruby  <cit>  have demonstrated that the activity of the vaccinia virus gil promoter is reduced by the insertion of the teto sequence. in our case, insertion in two different positions  did not affect expression . similarly, yao et al.  <cit>  did not see any decrease in promoter activity as a result of the insertion of the tet operator site. they reported efficient repression and attributed the success of their strategy to the positioning of the operator site. the positioning was such that the operator was  <dig> base pairs downstream of the tata box, resulting in repressor binding on the same side of the helix as the rna polymerase. the repressor is therefore able to sterically block the polymerase most effectively. in our case it is not possible to make a definitive prediction regarding dna-cymr interaction, since the exact sequence requirements for cymr binding to dna are not yet known. work is in progress to define sequences, both in the repressor and in the dna, that participate in this interaction.

tight control of transgene expression in a cell line stably expressing cymr is evident by examining gfp expression in 293-cmv5-cuo-gfp cells. fig. 4b allows a visual appreciation of the tight control in the off state. such tight regulation of gene expression is comparable to that reported for established cell lines being used in inducible expression systems  <cit> . although this strategy offers great promise for stable expression of a heterologous protein, it is limited by the strength of the cmv <dig> promoter in the relevant cell line.

to generate a regulatory system that would be more versatile in its application, we also generated a configuration of the switch that would be relatively independent of cellular transcription factors. the chimaeric transactivator, cta, which is active in several cell lines tested  and peer, cho  can activate transcription from multimers of either the perfect or imperfect repeat. the perfect palindrome, may be expected to be a better binding site for cymr. however, in our assay no significant difference was observed between the two sequences . perhaps, the differences in the two halves of the imperfect repeat are not in critical bases. moreover, in both cases six copies of the putative recognition sequence are used. cooperative binding of several activator molecules to the multimerized site may overcome any minor difference in binding activity to individual sites.

depending upon the application in question, it may be necessary to partially turn the expression of a gene of interest, on or off. we therefore investigated the dose response of reporter gene expression in both repressor and activator configurations of the switch. we chose to use flow cytometry since it has the advantage of providing information both on the fraction of cells expressing transgene and the intensity of transgene expression, as opposed to techniques where global expression is measured in a cellular extract . our data reveal changes at both levels, fraction of cells expressing transgene and the intensity of transgene expression upon the addition of cumate and show that, indeed reporter gene expression is regulated in a dose-dependent manner.

as expected, in the activator configuration, transgene expression is on in the absence of cumate, which for certain applications would require culturing cells in the presence of cumate to keep transgene expression off until appropriate. moreover, cumate would have to be removed from the culture medium to turn expression on. this can be problematic for different reasons including the delay in turning on expression related to the incomplete removal of cumate and the inconvenience of removing cumate from very large culture. we thus carried out a screen of mutant transactivators to identify a reverse mutant. a similar screen was carried out to identify the reverse tet activator, rtta. a first screen in a bacterial system identified the first generation of rtta  <cit> . however, a reverse mutant with better regulatory properties was isolated in a later screen in a eukaryotic cell type, saccharomyces cerevisae  <cit> . to increase the probability of identifying a mutant with optimal function in mammalian cells, we undertook the screen in  <dig> cells. however, this is a task with several technical challenges, a major one being the isolation of a host cell that has taken up the desired mutant and presuming this is successful, then, the isolation of the mutated dna from the cell. we thus used adenoviral vectors to deliver the library, since plaque-formation results in the localized amplification of individual adv and isolation of the mutated dna from the adenoviral genome is straightforward. our proprietary technology for the positive selection of recombinant adenoviruses further facilitated the task  <cit> . of all the mutants screened, only one had the desired reverse phenotype with respect to regulation of cuo binding by cumate. the rcta thus isolated, although functional, is sub-optimal in its regulatory function. all three mutations are in the 3'-half of the cdna. work is in progress to gain an insight into the structure-function analysis of the cymr to rationally design mutants with optimized cumate-regulated dna binding properties. in the mean time we decided to take advantage of the opposite regulation by cumate of dna binding of cymr and rcta similar to what was done for the tet system by freundlieb et al. <cit> . we thus controlled the expression of the rcta using cymr and generated cell lines with optimal regulation of gene expression in the reverse configuration and were thus able to obtain tight control of gene expression which is relatively cell-type independent and can be turned on with the addition of the inducer molecule, cumate.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have demonstrated the feasibility of harnessing the regulatory elements of the p-cym operon from pseudomonas putida to regulate gene expression in mammalian cells. in both the repressor and activator configurations, we have demonstrated tight control of gene expression both in transient and stable expression. although both systems have advantages, as might be expected, they also have limitations for various applications. to use the repressor configuration, it is imperative that a suitable promoter be available for the cell line in question. although this is rectified with the use of the cta, gene expression cannot be turned on by the addition of an inducer in this case. there is thus a need for the removal of cumate, which could be inconvenient in situations such as large-scale protein production. to increase the versatility of the expression system, we have isolated a reverse mutant, which allows gene expression to be turned on in the presence rather than absence of cumate. although the reverse mutant is sub-optimal, we have combined two configurations of the switch to generate tight control of gene expression. we thus have a versatile system with various configurations.
