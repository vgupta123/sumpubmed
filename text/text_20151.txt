BACKGROUND
rhizoctonia solani kühn is a species complex composed of genetically distinct groups of fungi in the cantherelloid clade of the phylum basidiomycota  <cit> . current classification within the r. solani species complex is based largely on grouping of isolates into anastomosis groups  based on their hyphal interactions. at least  <dig> ag have been described within the r. solani species complex including ag- <dig> to ag- <dig>  <cit> . current knowledge suggests that ag and their subgroups represent independent evolutionary units within r. solani  <cit> . anastomosis group  <dig>  of rhizoctonia solani kühn is associated primarily with diseases of solanaceous plants. two well defined phylogenetic  groups of r. solani ag- <dig> that cause diseases associated with potato and tobacco have been identified recently by analysis of sequence variation in ribosomal dna   <cit>  and beta-tubulin genes  <cit> : the ag- <dig> pt and tb. isolates from the two hosts are closely related, but differ in their dispersal, epidemiology, fatty acid composition, and aflp patterns  <cit> . moreover, the host range of isolates of r. solani from potato and tobacco does not overlap, suggesting that they may represent genetically subdivided populations that have evolved a high level of specificity on different solanaceous plant hosts  <cit> .

the ecology and epidemiology of r. solani ag- <dig> on potato and tobacco has been extensively studied  <cit> . in general, isolates of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato are predominantly asexual and survive as mycelium and sclerotia in soil and on potato seed tubers  <cit> . when the sexual stage  is formed during periods of cool and moist weather, meiospores  have limited dispersal and do not contribute directly to disease epidemics on potato  <cit> . however, sexual spores produced as a result of heterothallic mating, might constitute an important aspect of fungal life history that contributes to the genetic diversity and structure of field populations of r. solani ag- <dig> on potato. ceresini et al  <cit>  have recently suggested a model of population structure that includes both recombination and clonality for r. solani ag- <dig> on potato that provides experimental support for this assertion.

in contrast, isolates of r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco are predominantly sexual and basidiospores of t. cucumeris serve as infectious propagules that initiate disease on tobacco leaves. however, the mating system of t. cucumeris from tobacco is not known. likewise, it is not known whether recombination associated with sexual reproduction occurs among field isolates of r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco  <cit> .

despite the evidence for genetic division among populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco, many questions remain regarding their population biology and genetics. for example, although recombination had been detected within populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato, the role of asexual and sexual reproduction in determining population structure of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato is not known. similarly, questions remain about the extent of gene flow among populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco and between populations of ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco.

for r. solani ag- <dig> from potato, a recent study supports the concept of migration of the pathogen on potato seed tubers from source populations from northern us  and canada into nc, which provides evidence  for a low level of genetic differentiation between source and recipient populations  <cit> . however, the causal role of contemporary gene flow on the observed population structure has not been determined. traditional f statistics do not use temporal information on allelic variation, which would allow for inferences of evolutionary relationships. for example, there is no information revealing how current geographical patterns of genetic diversity in r. solani ag- <dig> from potato is influenced by population structure, history, and by a combination of structural and historical events.

in this study, four hypotheses were tested: 1) populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco have different levels of genetic diversity; 2)populations of ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco differ in their extent of recombination; 3) there is no gene flow between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco; and 4) there is no significant association between haplotypes of ag- <dig> from potato and geographic location.

the tobacco population of r. solani ag- <dig> is hypothesized to have a higher level of genetic diversity and a predominant recombining structure due to the importance of sexual spores on disease epidemics. in contrast, populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato are hypothesized to have lower level of genetic diversity and a non-recombining structure, probably due to the predominant clonal reproduction system. the complete absence of gene flow between ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco is hypothesized as the reason for these populations being genetically unconnected. the hypothesis of no geographical association implies that populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato constitutes one single panmictic population with no genetic subdivision.

therefore our goal was to analyze and further elucidate the phylogeography of populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco. to address these phylogeographical hypotheses, we have focused on the observation, description and analysis of the spatial distribution of genotypes of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco and the inference of historical scenarios based on coalescent gene genealogies  <cit> . in this study, we examined the sequence variation of two cloned nuclear dna fragments from r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco. these regions of the genome were selected based on a priori information from seven pcr-rflp markers previously used for genotyping r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco  <cit> .

RESULTS
measures of nucleotide diversity and intragenic recombination
for the total population of  <dig> isolates of r. solani ag- <dig> sampled,  <dig> unique haplotypes were identified for locus pp42f and  <dig> for locus pp <dig> . the haplotype  diversity was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at pp42f and pp <dig>  respectively. the average number of substitutions per site  between two random samples was  <dig>  at pp42f and  <dig>  at pp <dig>  the average number of nucleotide differences  was  <dig>   at pp42f whereas at pp <dig> k was  <dig>   =  <dig> ). of the total aligned  <dig> positions at pp42f,  <dig>  were polymorphic. at pp <dig>  from a total of  <dig> positions,  <dig>  were variable. of the variable positions,  <dig> at pp42f  and  <dig> at pp <dig>  were unique to a single sample.

a the total number of sites analyzed  was  <dig>  and  <dig> .

b the variances of k were estimated assuming free recombination.

c one single allele was detected in the north carolina sample of tobacco isolates.

for the potato sample of r. solani ag- <dig>   <dig> unique haplotypes were identified for locus pp42f and  <dig> for locus pp <dig> ; whereas, for ag- <dig> from tobacco only two haplotypes were identified at both pp42f and pp <dig>  consequently, higher haplotype diversity was observed for ag- <dig> from potato . in contrast, for ag- <dig> from tobacco, a considerably smaller value of haplotype diversity  was observed at both pp42f and pp <dig>  the average π value between two random samples was  <dig>  at pp42f and  <dig>  at pp <dig> for ag- <dig> from potato, whereas for r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco smaller π values ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   were observed. for r. solani ag- <dig> from potato, the average number of nucleotide differences  was  <dig>   at pp42f and  <dig>   at pp <dig>  the average k values for ag- <dig> from tobacco were smaller and ranged from  <dig>   at pp42f to  <dig>   at pp <dig>  of the total aligned  <dig> positions at pp42f,  <dig>  were polymorphic for ag- <dig> from potato and  <dig>  for ag- <dig> from tobacco. at pp <dig>  from a total of  <dig> positions,  <dig>  were variable for r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and  <dig>  for ag- <dig> from tobacco.

the spectrum of polymorphism along each locus  contrasts the high nucleotide diversity of the combined total sample of r. solani ag- <dig> with the potato and tobacco samples separately. most of the nucleotide diversity was observed between samples of potato and tobacco r. solani ag- <dig>  within-sample comparison indicated higher nucleotide diversity for r. solani ag- <dig> from potato than for r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco. for ag- <dig> from potato, recombination sites along the loci are indicated by geometric figures within the sliding windows. a minimum of four recombination events  was detected at pp42f: between sites  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the recombination parameter, r  <cit> , was estimated as  <dig>  per gene and  <dig>  between adjacent sites. at pp <dig>  a minimum of six recombination events were detected: between sites  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the estimate of r was  <dig>  per gene resulting in  <dig>  between adjacent sites. in contrast, no recombination events were detected for ag- <dig> from tobacco. the estimate of r, per gene, was  <dig>  and  <dig>  between adjacent sites at both pp42f and pp <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis
two major clades in r. solani ag- <dig> were inferred from the bayesian phylogenetics analysis of the sequence variation at the two cloned nuclear dna fragments pp42f and pp <dig> : the potato and tobacco clades. there was strong support  for the splitting of the potato and tobacco groups of r. solani ag- <dig> haplotypes . there were few other well-supported branches or clades  indicated in the phylogenetic gene tree. for pp <dig> , one of these well-supported clades included only haplotypes from northern us . there was strong support for a bifurcating branch that split the tobacco isolates into two distinct groups; one of which contained a haplotype detected in brazil.

intraspecific evolution of r. solani ag- <dig> inferred by analysis of haplotype networks
the reconstruction of haplotypes network of both pp42f and pp <dig> loci by statistical parsimony  supported the hypothesis of divergent evolution of genes from r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco. the degree of evolutionary relatedness was represented by mutational connections. there was no mutational connection linking any of the haplotypes of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato with haplotypes from tobacco in this network. the number of mutations splitting these two groups exceeded the calculated maximum connection steps  of eight for pp42f haplotypes and  <dig> for pp <dig>  the two haplotypes identified in the tobacco sample were also unconnected. this method also allows for the identification of the putative ancestral haplotype based on its frequency in the population. the most frequent allele is, theoretically, the oldest and could be identified, as the most interior to the network, showing several mutational connections  <cit> . however, the high gene diversity within r. solani ag- <dig> from potato did not allow for precise identification of the ancestral haplotype. within-sample analysis of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato identified probable recombinants through observations of sequence homoplasy in the networks of both pp42f  and pp <dig> loci .

population structure
analysis of the population structure using amova was conducted independently for both pp42f and pp <dig> loci. by grouping molecular sequencing haplotypes of r. solani based on their host of origin , most of the molecular variation was detected between potato and tobacco populations , with very little variation among geographical populations within each group . the within-population variance corresponded to  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total variance for pp42f and pp <dig> respectively. the overall Φst was  <dig>  for pp42f and  <dig>  for pp <dig> .

pairwise comparison between geographic populations was performed using estimates of fst equivalents  for both pp42f and pp <dig> loci separately . pairwise Φst values were significantly greater than zero, which would indicate population differentiation, mainly for comparisons between potato and tobacco populations of r. solani. for example, the potato populations from northern us or eastern nc were significantly different from both tobacco populations from central nc or southern brazil. there was no indication of differentiation between the tobacco populations of central nc and southern brazil. in contrast, while no subdivision or differentiation was observed between the potato populations from northern us and eastern nc for the pp42f locus , differentiation between these two populations was observed for the pp <dig> locus .

a population pairwise Φst was calculated using arlequin version  <dig>   <cit> . asterisks indicate significance of p values at p ≤  <dig>   leading to values of Φst larger than or equal to the observed value when permuting molecular sequencing genotypes between populations .

nested clade analysis
to discriminate between phylogenetic patterns resulting from historical events from those due to recurrent gene flow, we performed nested clade analysis on the haplotype network of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato obtained by statistical parsimony analysis and presented in figure 3-b. the resulting nesting design and the nca are presented in figure  <dig>  no nca was performed for the pp42f haplotype network  due to no population subdivision observed between eastern nc and northern us for this locus.

for the nca of pp <dig>  high sequence variation was observed, and such variation has caused a few cases of ambiguity  in the network estimation. as the nca does not accommodate recombination, haplotypes p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were removed from the reticulate network presented in figure 3-b. a significant geographical association pattern indicating restricted gene flow with isolation by distance was found . the interior haplotypes p <dig> and p <dig> from northern america contained in the one-step clade 1- <dig> showed significantly large  dc. in addition, these internal haplotypes showed larger dc than the average clade distance for the tip haplotype p <dig> that has presumably descended from it . at the higher level, within the entire cladogram nesting, the tip clade 3- <dig> , showed significantly small dc, indicating restricted gene flow as well. in contrast, clade 3- <dig> showed a significantly large dc, which would indicate a long distance dispersal event, probably from wisconsin to maine, which contained the tip haplotypes. clade 3- <dig> includes the two-step clades 2- <dig>  and 2- <dig> . this 3-step clade contained haplotypes only observed in northern america.

coalescent analysis
neutrality tests were performed for each locus and populations of r. solani ag- <dig>  indicating neutral evolution of both loci for the populations from potato. evidence of non-neutral evolution was found in both pp42f and pp <dig> loci for the pooled populations of ag- <dig> from tobacco . for these two loci in the tobacco  group the significant statistical values were negative. a significant test result is consistent with either population growth or shrinkage, or background selection  <cit> . we hypothesized that the deviation from neutrality observed for the tb group was due to a decline in effective population size. this hypothesis was supported by the exponential population growth estimates   <cit> . the g values for both pp42f and pp <dig> were negative for the tb group, indicating population shrinkage . in contrast, positive g values indicated that the populations from potato were growing. however, g values are not symmetrical in magnitude due to its exponential effect on the population growth . thus, a g =  <dig> would indicates a rather slow growth while a g = - <dig> indicates a significant shrinkage of the population.

b theta values represent a measure of effective population size .

c migration between geographical or host populations was estimated using an isolation with migration model in the program migrate implemented by snap workbench  <cit> . source populations are shown along the top and sink populations are indicated on the left. estimates of population's growth, theta and migration rates are at 95% confidence interval.

the population parameter theta was used as a relative measure of effective population size. the estimates of theta are summarized in table  <dig>  the pattern observed for the pp42f locus suggests a larger effective population size for the pooled r. solani ag- <dig> populations  from potato  when compared to the pooled ag- <dig> populations  from tobacco . however, for the pp <dig> locus the theta values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the populations of ag- <dig> from potato from eastern nc and northern us, respectively, and  <dig>  for the pooled population samples of r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco.

estimates of directional gene flow between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco were consistent with relatively low rates of migration between them and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . when the pooled populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato were compared with the pooled populations from tobacco for the pp42f locus, the estimates of directional gene flow  were very low, with a historical movement of genes from the pooled potato populations  to the pooled tobacco populations  of r. solani ag- <dig> . for the pp <dig> locus, there was no evidence of migration between either of the two populations from potato to the pooled populations from tobacco. however, the migration parameter was estimated to be  <dig>   from the pooled tobacco populations to the eastern nc potato population. while the highest historical migration contribution was observed from the eastern nc to the northern us potato population of ag- <dig> , a much smaller migration value was observed in the opposite direction .

from the coalescent analyses, the overall tree topologies and the relative divergence of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco were consistent for both pp42f and pp <dig> loci. the ancestral distribution of mutation and coalescent events for the two loci are presented in figure  <dig>  the branching between the populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco occurred at the deepest point, suggesting an ancient divergence between them. the tobacco populations of ag- <dig> represent the oldest lineages within the trees , and estimates of divergence are five times greater in magnitude. the relative ages of the populations from tobacco varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  units of coalescent time . populations from potato have experienced a recent expansion as demonstrated by the diversification of haplotypes in both gene trees and were inferred to be younger than those from tobacco.

discussion
we have studied two closely related sister groups within the basidiomycete fungus r. solani ag- <dig> on taxonomically related hosts and this system provided us with a unique opportunity to examine aspects of their population genetics in a phylogeographic framework.

during the process of screening of markers for population genetics, four of seven pcr-rflp markers previously used for genotyping isolates of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato  also amplified genomic dna from r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco. except for marker pp42f, none of the alleles present in the sample of  <dig> tobacco isolates of r. solani ag- <dig> from tobacco were shared with the potato sample  <cit> . as these markers were shown to be conserved enough to amplify genes across potato and tobacco populations of ag- <dig>  we explored their potential appropriateness for phylogenetic and population genetics analyses within r. solani ag- <dig>  for this study, we selected two  of these four genetic markers. an important outcome from the sequencing analysis of these two markers  was the increasing power for discriminating alleles within a locus. genotyping by pcr-rflps indicated the occurrence of only two or three alleles  within a potato population of r. solani ag- <dig> from nc  <cit> . however, genotyping by sequencing analysis indicated that the actual number of alleles present within that population was much higher, with  <dig> at pp42f and  <dig> at pp <dig> 

the first objective of this study was to determine the extent of genetic divergence between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco. the potato sample was more genetically diverse showing a higher number of nucleotide differences among haplotypes, which resulted in high haplotype  diversity. in contrast with the sample from potato, limited to no genetic diversity was observed within the tobacco sample from nc and brazil. the number of nucleotide differences was considerably smaller for tobacco than for potato isolates of r. solani ag- <dig>  only two haplotypes were found for the tobacco population in brazil, with a single haplotype predominating in north america. our results support the first hypothesis that populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco have different levels of molecular diversity. consistent with the heterokaryotic nature of r. solani, every isolate of ag- <dig> from potato had at least one heterozygous locus. however, all tobacco isolates from both nc and brazil were homozygous.

the other specific objective of this study was to determine how populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco are shaped by recombination. we addressed this objective by analyzing the intragenic recombination at pp <dig> and pp <dig> loci. this analysis was done by determining both the recombination parameter r within a locus  <cit>  and the minimum number of recombination events between two adjacent sites at the same locus  <cit> .

the tobacco population of r. solani ag- <dig> was hypothesized to have a predominantly recombining structure due to the importance of sexual spores in disease epidemics. in theory, progeny generated via this type of reproduction would be genetically different than parental individuals as a result of recombination of genetically different nuclei  <cit> . in contrast, the potato population of ag- <dig> was hypothesized to have a non-recombining structure, probably because of the predominant clonal reproduction system.

higher values of r were detected for the population of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato. in addition, a minimum of four recombination events were detected between sites along the pp <dig> locus and six recombination events at pp <dig> for the isolates of ag- <dig> from potato. putative recombinants were also identified through observations of homoplasy in the networks of both pp42f and pp <dig> loci . in contrast, no recombination events were detected for ag- <dig> isolates from tobacco. our data support the alternative hypotheses of a sexual recombining structure for r. solani ag- <dig> from potato. this is in agreement with the common occurrence and observation of the sexual stage in potato fields and previous research results that suggested recombination was occurring in population of ag- <dig> from potato based on analyses of the population structure of the fungus with seven co-dominant pcr-rflp markers  <cit> . all seven loci were found in hardy weinberg equilibrium and no linkage disequilibrium was detected for any pair of loci  <cit> .

in contrast with the potato population, we found no evidence of recombination for the tobacco population. fungal progeny generated via asexual or homothallic sexual  reproduction would be nearly genetically identical to the parental individuals  in the absence of outcrossing. no or limited outcrossing would contribute to the association between independent characters , a population with limited genetic diversity and the repeated recovery of similar genotypes  and new genotype in the population would arise mainly as a result of mutation  <cit> .

our previous observation indicated a clonal population structure for ag- <dig> from tobacco in nc based on the one-to-one  association between two independent criteria   <cit> . however, our current data is not sufficient for supporting the alternative hypothesis of clonality for ag- <dig> from tobacco because only two haplotypes were detected for each locus in the tobacco populations. the limited amount of genetic variation in this sample would not be sufficient to accurately assess the relative contribution of recombination in the pathogen population.

the third hypothesis tested in this study was that no gene flow occurs between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco, indicating that they constitute genetically distinct groups. the objective was to describe this pair of populations of r. solani ag- <dig> by the proportion of loci that show unilateral or reciprocal fixation, and by standard estimates of statistics based on gene flow.

in recently evolved species pairs it is expected to identify variable nucleotide positions where polymorphisms are shared by both sibling species, other nucleotide positions where only one species is polymorphic and the other is fixed for one allele, and where both species have fixed loci  <cit> . an analysis of the dna polymorphisms at each locus, suggested that most of the nucleotide diversity occurred between samples of potato and tobacco r. solani ag- <dig>  as genetic isolation is considered to precede the loss of shared polymorphism, discovering a single locus or multiple loci that show fixation in one or the other of the phylogenetic species would be evidence of genetic isolation  <cit> . no alleles were shared between the potato and tobacco populations of r. solani ag- <dig> used in this study. in addition, analysis of population structure indicated no gene flow between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco. most of the molecular variation and differentiation was detected between potato and tobacco populations of r. solani ag- <dig>  in contrast, a high level of gene flow was detected for tobacco group of r. solani ag- <dig>  with only one exception , all of the isolates from nc and the brazilian population of ag- <dig> from tobacco shared the same alleles at both pp <dig> and pp <dig> loci.

from the bayesian phylogenetics analysis of cloned nuclear dna fragments pp42f and pp <dig>  two major clades in r. solani ag- <dig> were inferred, splitting haplotypes from potato and tobacco into two groups. in addition, the reconstruction of the haplotype network of both pp42f and pp <dig> loci by statistical parsimony indicated no mutational connection linking any of the haplotypes of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco in this network. these results support the hypothesis of divergent evolution of genes from populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco.

the fourth hypothesis tested was that there is no significant association between haplotypes of ag- <dig> from potato and geographic origin, which implies that there is a single panmictic population with no genetic subdivision.

based on f statistics, an important observation about gene flow was inferred from the within-group analysis of population subdivision of the sample of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato. while gene flow  was detected between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato at the pp42f locus, population differentiation was detected for the locus pp <dig> 

to infer historical events influencing the current geographical patterns observed on populations of the pathogen, we performed nca analysis on a reticulated phylogeny of ag- <dig> haplotypes from potato. the main benefit of using haplotype tree information is its qualitative advantage of discriminating among various biological explanations for any detected geographical association. by using a haplotype network analysis it was possible to examine spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation in populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato whereas the f-statistics analysis could only examine the current spatial pattern.

based on nca, the null hypothesis of no association between haplotype variation and geography was rejected for pp <dig> locus. for this locus, the first prediction for the population structure hypothesis was that restricted gene flow caused the geographical associations. within clade 1- <dig> from northern america, clade distance equal to zero was associated with the tip pp <dig> haplotype p <dig> whereas significantly large clade distance was associated with the interior haplotypes p <dig> and p <dig>  in addition, the average interior clade distance minus the average tip clade distance was significantly large. these observations fulfilled the prediction that under restricted gene flow younger or tip clades should be less widespread relatively to older clades interior to them  <cit> . this is because restricted gene flow implies only limited movement by individuals during any giving generation as it takes time for a new haplotype to spread geographically. another aspect of restricted gene flow is that the new haplotypes initially reside within the range of its ancestor for many generations, which is predicted by the isolation by distance model. in contrast, the ancestor would have a wider geographic distribution  <cit> .

at the higher clade level the tip clade 3- <dig> , showed significantly small dn, indicating restricted gene flow. in contrast, clade 3- <dig> showed a significantly large dn, which would indicate a long distance dispersal event, probably from wisconsin to maine, which contained the tip haplotypes. however, conclusions concerning a long distance dispersal event should be interpreted cautiously since our sampling procedure was geographically limited. therefore, it may not be possible to discriminate between isolation by distance and long distance gene flow models  <cit> .

the patterns of spatial structure and differentiation between potato populations of r. solani ag- <dig> revealed by the two distinct markers were conflicting and deserve further discussion. discordant patterns of divergence in molecular markers and loci are commonly interpreted as differences in mutation rate, neutrality or linkage disequilibrium with other loci that are subject to selection, and the differential effect of natural selection on those markers and loci  <cit> . although we do not have ancillary information on whether the genetic loci examined in this study have distinct mutation rates, our data suggest a model of neutral evolution for both loci . a plausible explanation for the conflicting patterns of spatial structure is due to the distinct resolution capabilities associated with difference in per-locus sequence length. for pp <dig> we detected  <dig> polymorphic sites in  <dig> bp and for pp <dig> we detected  <dig> segregating sites in  <dig> bp. the paucity of informative sites on pp42f resulting from the analyses of less sequence length might have introduced a downward bias in the estimate of population differentiation. support for this assertion is based on simulation data on how many loci are needed and how much sequence is required from each locus to provide better estimates of population genetic parameters  <cit> .

in this study, we also conducted coalescent-based simulations of genealogical relationships between populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco to estimate the amount and directionality of historical migration patterns in time, the ages of mutations and of populations . this is the first time that a genealogical approach  was used to study the population genetics and evolution of a rhizoctonia pathosystem.

tests of non-neutral evolution could not be rejected for the two loci, considering only the populations from tobacco. we believe that the observed patterns of gene diversity is most likely due to changes in population size and not to a intrinsic feature of the loci. given the contemporary theta values  <cit>  it was possible to extrapolate the relative increase or decrease in population size since the time of divergence. growth rate estimates  <cit>  were consistent with a significant decrease in size for the tobacco populations of r. solani ag- <dig>  we hypothesize that this decrease in size reflects a split where only a small fraction of the ancestral pathogen population founded a new population during the domestication of tobacco from the wild habitats into agricultural fields. in contrast, results from lamarc analyses  <cit>  were consistent with expansion of the potato populations of r. solani ag- <dig>  the increase in r. solani ag- <dig> effective population size on potato was most likely caused by a corresponding increase in host population size following the expansion of agriculture.

although characterized as being younger than the tobacco population of ag- <dig>  the potato population has experienced a very recent diversification in the us. in contrast, the two tobacco populations sampled from southern brazil and central nc , had a small effective population size. older ancestor populations with higher haplotype diversity of r. solani  might exist in the center of origin of tobacco and other related solanaceae.

our findings corroborate previous information that populations of r. solani ag- <dig> are subdivided by host specialization, constituting two distinct phylotypes  <cit> . r. solani ag- <dig> represents at least two phylogenetic species that display high phenotypic differences in disease biology and ecology  <cit> .

low rates of historical movement of genes were observed between the potato and tobacco populations of ag- <dig>  these two populations of r. solani ag- <dig> represented two distinctly and historically divergent lineages, which have probably evolved within the range of their particular hosts as sympatric species. reinforcement is considered as an important mechanism of speciation between sympatrically divergent populations  <cit> . reinforcement is the active mechanism of reproductive isolation due to reduced fitness of the interspecific hybrids, thereby favoring intraspecific mating and resulting in genetic differentiation between species  <cit> . reproductive success between r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco was not tested in our study, but this testing could provide knowledge about the mechanisms involved in sympatric speciation of r. solani ag- <dig> 

the contrasting ecological context of these two host specific populations makes our study a good example of ecological speciation between lineages of plant pathogenic fungal populations. host range and disease causing ability are clearly important factors in fungal speciation. consistent with our study, evidence for lineage divergence strongly associated with closely-related host species has been previously reported for other fungi, such as magnaporthe grisea and mycosphaerella graminicola  <cit> . several studies have also reported extensive genetic differentiation between divergent fungal species  <cit> .

the results presented in this paper provide important insight into our understanding of the phylogeography of populations of r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco. the next step of our research will involve a more in depth study to reveal the origins and patterns of domestication of these two phylogenetically distinct populations of r. solani ag- <dig>  our experimental approach will involve a global sampling strategy for isolation of r. solani ag- <dig> from solanum tuberosum  and nicotianna tabacum  and including additional host species of solanum and nicotiana.

a global phylogeographical framework is critical to unravel the answers on large scale-hypotheses on the origins and evolution of r. solani ag- <dig> as a pathogen of domesticated crops within the solanaceae. a sampling initiative towards the understanding of the phylogeography of populations from potato and tobacco should include the main potato and tobacco growing areas in the world, besides the centers of origin in the andes mountain valleys of bolivia, peru, columbia and ecuador, in south america   <cit> . it also should include africa and australia for the nicotiana, which is part of a truly widespread tribe within the solanaceae with a gondwanan distribution   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the two sister populations of the basidiomycete fungus r. solani ag- <dig> from potato and tobacco represent two distinct and historically divergent lineages that have probably evolved within the range of their particular related solanaceae hosts as sympatric species.
