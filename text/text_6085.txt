BACKGROUND
parthenium argentatum gray, commonly known as guayule, is a shrub in the asteraceae that is native to the southwestern united states and northern mexico. parthenium argentatum produces high quality rubber in bark tissue, which is under development for biomedical uses. the u.s. food and drug administration recently approved the first medical device made from p. argentatum natural rubber. products made from p. argentatum latex are designed for people who have type i latex allergies, induced by natural rubber proteins from hevea brasiliensis. in addition to biomedical products, natural rubber is essential and irreplaceable in many industrial and consumer applications, and the price is rising under heavy demand, making natural rubber increasingly more precious. as an industrial crop that grows in temperate climates, p. argentatum represents a viable alternative source of high quality natural rubber.

one strategy for improving crops, such as the rubber-producing p. argentatum, is through chloroplast engineering  <cit> . transformation of chloroplasts allows high-level production of foreign proteins because of the high number of chloroplasts per plant cell. as homologous recombination is the means by which foreign dna is incorporated into the chloroplast genome, transformation is precise and predictable. moreover, it has been shown that up to four genes can be inserted at once  <cit> , enhancing the efficiency of metabolic engineering. from production of edible vaccines to bioplastics, transplastomic plants have been shown to provide a useful route to manipulate crops for industrial purposes  <cit> .

importantly from the point of view of minimizing environmental impact, expressing foreign proteins in the chloroplast results in transgene containment  <cit> . it is thought that in the vast majority of plant species, chloroplasts are not transmitted by pollen, and so in these species, chloroplastidic transgenes would not be spread in that manner. although, it is becoming clear that each case must be thoroughly verified  <cit> . in the case of p. argentatum, transgene containment is important because it is currently cultivated as an industrial crop in its native region in the southwestern united states.

construction of vectors for chloroplast transformation requires some knowledge of the chloroplast genome sequence to identify insertion sites. to date, just short of one hundred plastid genomes from angiosperms have been completely sequenced. the sequences are highly conserved  <cit> . interestingly however, the order of genes in some groups, including the asteraceae, fabaceae and poaceae, may be reversed by large inversions  <cit> . in the asteraceae, the family of interest in this study, there is a second small inversion  nested within the larger inversion   <cit> . the two inversions are always found together, implying that they occurred close in evolutionary time.

chloroplast sequences are useful for identification of species, using a particular sequence as a dna tag or barcode  <cit> . an ideal dna barcode for general purposes would 1) have enough diversity to allow discrimination among species, but not so much that would prevent grouping of members of a species, 2) work in wide variety of taxa, and 3) provide the basis for reliable amplifications and sequences  <cit> . in plants, unlike in animals, the mitochondrial genome evolves too slowly to provide useful dna barcode sequences. although also possessing a relatively slow rate of evolution, several chloroplast sequences have been identified as fulfilling the criteria listed above  <cit> . depending on the desired level of discrimination, the consensus conclusion appears to be that the low mutation rate in the chloroplast genome may require more than one barcode locus to be probed  <cit> .

at present, classical breeding is being used to improve p. argentatum as a commercial source of natural rubber. breeding efforts would be enhanced by informative chloroplast dna barcodes. because a very small amount of tissue is required for barcode analysis, purity of breeding lines can be determined at an early stage of seedling growth. in addition, barcodes would allow breeders and seed producers to discover seed lot contamination before advancing breeding lines for latex production. having the ability to removing contaminating lines, especially when they represent lower rubber lines, would improve the efficacy of breeding efforts.

the focus of our research program is improvement of p. argentatum to enhance its commercial viability. we have chosen two approaches, biotechnology through chloroplast metabolic engineering and marker-assisted breeding. the p. argentatum chloroplast genome sequence that we report herein, supports our efforts in both approaches. in this article, we report the complete sequence of the chloroplast genome of p. argentatum and describe the development of dna barcodes. the complete sequence of the p. argentatum chloroplast genome has enabled us to construct chloroplast transformation vectors based on the exact sequence of the large inverted regions, and to identify novel insertion sites in non-essential, non-coding regions. barcode analysis with the matk gene and psba-trnh spacer sequence allowed us to discriminate three of four parthenium species from each other and from p. argentatum, and a subset of the p. argentatum lines from each other. these barcodes will be used in our breeding program.

RESULTS
genome size and gene content, order and organization
the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome of parthenium argentatum is represented in a circular map . it is  <dig>  bp in size and includes a duplicated region of inverted repeats  of  <dig>  bp. the ir are separated by small single copy  and large single copy  regions of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the total g+c content of the whole chloroplast genome is  <dig> %. the gene content and arrangement were observed to be similar to those in lactuca sativa and helianthus annuus  <cit> , and guitozia abyssinica , including one large  and one small inversion  in the lsc region. there are  <dig> genes coding for proteins , including six that are duplicated in the ir regions. there are four rrna genes that are also duplicated in the ir regions. in total there are  <dig> trna genes, seven of which are duplicated in the ir, one in the ssc, with the remaining  <dig> scattered in the lsc region.

the size of the p. argentatum chloroplast sequence is larger than those of the three other asteraceae chloroplast genomes . it is close to the same size as the l. sativa genome, and  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb larger than the g. abyssinica and h. annuus genome, respectively, with the length differences primarily found in the lsc and ssc domains. the sequence differences between p. argentatum and each of the other three chloroplast genomes are concentrated in the noncoding regions of inv <dig>  and the ssc and lsc regions . the ir regions in p. argentatum are shorter than those of the three other species by 210- <dig> bp .

aregions in chloroplast genome; lsc, large single copy; ssc, small single copy; ir, inverted repeats.

based on sequence comparison of the chloroplast genome of p. argentatum with h. annuus and l. sativa, two inversions of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp were observed in p. argentatum, similar to those described by kim et al.  <cit>  and timme et al.  <cit> . in p. argentatum, one end point of the  <dig> kb inversion was located between the trns-gcu and trng-ucc genes. the other end point is located between the trne-uuc and trnt-ggu genes. the second  <dig>  kb inversion was observed within the  <dig> kb inversion, which shares one end point just upstream of the trne-uuc gene with the large inversion. the other end point of the  <dig>  kb inversion is located between the trnc-gca and rpob genes .

variation in chloroplast coding sequences of asteraceae family members
variation between coding sequences of p. argentatum and h. annuus, g. abyssinica or l. sativa was analyzed by comparing each individual gene  as well as the overall sequences . in general, p. argentatum coding sequences are more similar to those in g. abyssinica  and h. annuus , than in l. sativa . the greater average identity in g. abyssinica than in h. annuus is in large part due to deletions in the two copies of the ycf <dig> loci in h. annuus, otherwise, h. annuus is more similar overall than g. abyssinica. fourteen genes in h. annuus and g. abyssinica were 100% identical to those in p. argentatum, compared to only four genes in l. sativa . the most-divergent coding regions in the three genomes were ycf <dig>  accd, clpp, rps <dig>  and ndha .

dna barcode analysis of parthenium
to differentiate parthenium taxa, a molecular approach was used in which we analyzed four different chloroplast dna regions, which were shown to be useful dna barcodes in past studies  <cit> . these regions were the trnl-uaa intron, rpoc, matk and the non-coding spacer region between the two genes psba-trnh. tests were conducted on dna of three parthenium species  and three cultivated lines of p. argentatum  . the best differentiation of parthenium species and lines within p. argentatum was obtained with the psba-trnh spacer region barcode. there were  <dig> indel sites in  <dig> bp of dna in the six lines tested. when  <dig> bp of the matk dna barcode were analyzed, a total of  <dig> indel sites were found. in  <dig> bp from the trnl-uaa intron region, only one indel site was observed. obtaining good sequence from the rpoc spacer region was difficult, but in  <dig> bp, four indel sites were identified. therefore, due to the higher number of informative sites, the matk and psba-trnh dna barcodes were used for further studies of parthenium taxa.

the matk dna barcode
after re-evaluation of the  <dig> bp sequence of matk, an efficient barcode for parthenium species was defined. using the parth-matk-f and parth-matk-r primers, matk dna sequences were examined in parthenium species, lines of p. argentatum and az <dig>  a hybrid of p. argentatum cv.  <dig> × p. tomentosum. we sampled  <dig> nucleotides in the matk gene, which yielded fourteen potentially informative, variable positions , with eight nucleotide substitutions  and six length mutations  . although the psba-trnh spacer region in p. integrifolium dna did amplify with the psba-trnh barcode primers, the matk locus did not amplify with the matk-barcode primers. this matk barcode was effective at differentiating p. schottii, p. hysterophorus, and p. tomentosum from each other and from a group that included p. incanum, p. argentatum lines and one hybrid . this barcode did not differentiate p. incanum from the seven p. argentatum lines and the hybrid .

the psba-trnh dna barcode
the non-coding spacer region between psba and trnh was used to differentiate several parthenium species, lines of p. argentatum and a hybrid of two parthenium species . a  <dig> bp region was amplified via pcr using the psba-f and trnh-r primers. this region produced the best differentiation . we sampled  <dig> nucleotides in the psba and trnh spacer, which yielded fourteen potentially informative, variable positions , with eleven nucleotide substitutions  and three length mutations . first of all, we found that there was 100% consensus in the barcode sequence among samples tested of line az <dig> , az <dig> , cal <dig> , az <dig> , p. incanum  and p. tomentosum . on the other hand, there was a second barcode sequence within line az <dig> , az <dig> , az <dig> , az <dig>  and  <dig> . the minority or alternative barcodes differed from the corresponding common barcode by one to three bases.

the psba-trnh spacer barcode differentiated p. hysterophorus, p. integrifolium and p. schottii from each other and from all the other species and lines. the psba-trnh spacer barcode of p. argentatum cultivar  <dig> and the two breeding lines c <dig> and c <dig> was different from those of the remaining p. argentatum lines, p. tomentosum and p. incanum. the barcode of az <dig>  which is a hybrid between p. argentatum cultivar   <dig> and p. tomentosum, is similar to or identical to that of p. tomentosum. parthenium incanum's barcode clustered with two az <dig> variants and a plant of unknown parentage, indicating their close relationship. analysis with both the psba-trnh spacer and matk barcodes provided further differentiation . the combined barcodes of az <dig> and p. tomentosum are more similar to each other than to all those of the p. argentatum lines together with p. incanum. drilling deeper, the barcodes of cv. 11591/c156/c <dig> are different from those of p. incanum and all the remaining p. argentatum lines.

discussion
comparative genome organization and structure
asteraceae is one of the largest families of flowering plants with approximately  <dig>  genera and  <dig>  species. production of secondary metabolites is a key feature of this diverse family. for example, several genera within the asteraceae produce high molecular weight rubber in the cytosol, including lactuca sativa  <cit>  and taraxacum kok-saghyz  <cit> , and the species of interest to our studies, parthenium argentatum. to support efforts to improve the levels of rubber production in this industrial crop, the sequence of the chloroplast genome of p. argentatum was determined. this information is useful for our efforts in chloroplast engineering. the barcodes we present will be used in breeding of commercially important lines in the genus parthenium.

within the asteraceae, the p. argentatum chloroplast sequence represents the fourth complete sequence. this sequence reveals that the chloroplast genomes of p. argentatum, h. annuus, g. abyssinica and l. sativa are identical in gene order and content . the four genomes differ slightly in length, with the chloroplast genome in p. argentatum somewhat longer than those in l. sativa, g. abyssinica and h. annuus, respectively . two inversions in the chloroplast genome are shared by two of the three subfamilies of the asteraceae  <cit>  and are present in p. argentatum . in h. annuus, the ir-located gene ycf <dig> has an internal deletion of  <dig> bp that is not found in the three other genomes. the large chloroplast gene ycf <dig> specifies an expressed protein  <cit> , whose function has not yet been determined, although ycf2's homology to atpases was noted by wolfe  <cit> . our protein domain analysis  <cit>  suggests similarity with conserved domains of the atpase aaa family that perform chaperone-like functions involved in assembly or disassembly of protein complexes. in some chloroplast genomes, particularly in grasses, ycf <dig> is entirely absent  <cit> . despite that fact, knockout studies in nicotiana tabacum demonstrated that ycf <dig> is essential for survival  <cit> . there must be sufficient coding sequence remaining in h. annuus to provide any essential ycf <dig> function. interestingly, ycf <dig> is one of the eight fastest evolving genes in the chloroplast genome . notably, this rapid evolution has taken place in the framework of the more slowly evolving ir region as a whole . another notable size difference in coding regions is found in the ssc region. the ssc region of the chloroplast genome of p. argentatum is  <dig> to  <dig> bp longer than that in the other species . within the ssc region, the ycf <dig> gene has a 3'-deletion in h. annuus, g. abyssinica and l. sativa . similar to ycf <dig>  ycf <dig> encodes a protein of unknown function that is also essential  <cit> . it appears to be a multi-pass transmembrane protein, with no clear association to known functional domains.

in a comparative study of individual genes of p. argentatum, h. annuus, g. abyssinica and l. sativa, we identified several sequences with high levels of differences along their length, the most divergent including the already mentioned ycf <dig>  and clpp, rps <dig>  accd, and ndha . interestingly, three of these genes, ycf <dig>  accd and clpp, are essential plastid genes in some taxa, but not others  <cit> . the presence of non-coding intronic sequences in both ndha and rps <dig> contributes to the divergence in those two loci  <cit> . these divergent sequences among the four asteraceae chloroplast genomes identify the fastest evolving regions containing coding sequences.

metabolic engineering of plants by inserting transgenes in the chloroplast would potentially be made more efficient with knowledge of chloroplast sequences, based on the conclusions of one group that chloroplast transformation efficiency was significantly enhanced when vectors were constructed with 100% homologous sequences  <cit> . other groups have shown that precise homology may not be essential, as tobacco sequences  <cit>  were sufficient to allow recombination in tomato  <cit> , potato  <cit> , and petunia  <cit> . the chloroplast genome sequence of p. argentatum was used to design a 100% specific chloroplast transformation vector , to maximize the possibility of successful recombination. improving crop plants via chloroplast transformation is a viable strategy  <cit>  that will be pursued in this industrial crop.

dna barcodes
chloroplast genomic sequences were used to develop dna barcodes to discriminate at the species level and below. the matk barcode contained sufficient information to differentiate three parthenium species  from each other and from p. argentatum and p. incanum. however, the matk-barcode did not differentiate p. incanum from p. argentatum or p. agentatum lines from each other . the psba-trnh spacer barcode provided additional differentiation at the species level and below . interestingly, when the matk gene and the psba-trnh spacer barcode information was combined, p. tomentosum and cv.  <dig> were differentiated from the remaining p. argentatum lines and p. incanum. using the combined barcodes, we observed that they were more similar in p. argentatum az <dig> to az <dig> and cal <dig> lines overall than they were in the p. argentatum cv.  <dig>  breeding lines c- <dig> and c <dig>  and hybrid line az <dig> . to understand the pattern of differentiation, it would be useful to have precise information about the pedigrees of all the lines. unfortunately, in most cases that is either lacking or incomplete. we know that az <dig> and az <dig> were selected from the same seed lot  <cit>  and their combined barcodes are very similar . we cannot trace the ancestors of az <dig>  az <dig> and az <dig> to understand the history of their relatedness to az <dig>  az <dig>  az <dig> and cal <dig>  the barcodes of the two p. argentatum lines az <dig> and az <dig> were not different, which is not surprising as az <dig> and az <dig> were selections from the same  <dig> seed lot  <cit> , however, it would be expected that their majority barcodes would be more similar to  <dig> than they are. the psba-trnh dna barcode analysis demonstrated that two plants of az <dig>  # <dig> grown in a field at higby and # <dig> grown in a field at the maricopa agriculture center  have a different psba-trnh barcode than the common dna barcode sequence of az <dig> . these do not appear to be pure az <dig> derivatives and may represent seed contaminants. several of the p. argentatum lines were homogeneous according to the psba-trnh spacer sequence, including az <dig>  az <dig>  and cal  <dig>  other lines were less homogeneous, including az <dig>  az <dig>  az <dig>  and az <dig>  with a minority sequence present in  <dig> to 20% of the individuals tested. from our own observations in the field, p. argentatum accessions are highly heterogeneous in growth habit, suggesting that seed lots are composed of highly mixed genetic populations. this would not be unexpected for open-pollinated, self-incompatible, field-grown lines. our barcode data support the heterogeneity and provides information that will be used immediately to differentiate breeding populations.

classical breeding efforts will be enhanced by using the informative chloroplast dna barcode we describe herein. we assessed the genetic purity of a small population of p. argentatum using the psba-trnh barcode and were able to show, as described above, which lines had undergone homogenization and which had not . knowledge of the purity of lines and the presence of contaminating seeds, will further our breeding efforts of lines that are being advanced for latex production.

our barcode study was useful in providing support for the maternal parent of the hybrid plant, az <dig>  az <dig> is a vigorous interspecific hybrid, low in rubber concentration, but high in biomass production  <cit> . the line is the result of an open-pollinated cross between p. argentatum cv.  <dig> and p. tomentosum cv. stramonium  <cit> . az <dig> most likely inherited its chloroplast genome from p. tomentosum, as az <dig> and p. tomentosum are not differentiated by the combined barcode system . although we do no know the reason for the difference, our results are not the same as those from the non-dna analyses by ray and co-workers  <cit> . more extensive analysis of differences at the dna level is necessary.

according to the literature, there are about a dozen species of parthenium growing on the north american continent. however, p. argentatum is the only species with commercially viable amounts of rubber. other species such as p. incanum and p. tomentosum produce primarily resinous materials  <cit> . the substrate for rubber biosynthesis is isopentenyl pyrophosphate   <cit> . chloroplasts have been shown to contribute to the pool of ipp in plant cells . if the levels of chloroplastic ipp production vary from line to line, it may be possible to breed for enhancements in substrate production by controlling the maternal parent. this suggests that hybrids could be developed using a maternal parent that produces more rubber like az <dig> combined with a higher biomass from a line like az <dig>  to produce a superior plant. more experiments are necessary to understand the role of the maternal parent in rubber biosynthesis.

our preliminary results on lack of pcr amplification from mature pollen dna of targets within the ir regions , suggest that chloroplasts are not present in the mature pollen and thereby are likely to be maternally inherited in p. argentatum. use of plastid specific barcodes derived from the genome sequence, will allow us to definitively track any paternal inheritance in future experiments. with the recent finding of paternal inheritance in a weedy helianthus species  <cit> , as well as in species previously considered to lack paternal inheritance in pollen, such as arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , it is crucial that extensive studies are performed, especially if a strategy for transgene containment depends on not transferring transgenes in pollen.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome sequence of the p. argentatum chloroplast will enrich the sequence resources of plastid genomes in commercial crops. the availability of the complete plastid genome sequence may facilitate improved transformation efficiency by using the precise endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory elements in chloroplast transformation vectors. the dna barcoding study forms the foundation for genetic identification of commercially important lines of p. argentatum that are producing natural rubber latex for biomedical applications.
