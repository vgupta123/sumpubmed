BACKGROUND
sex-determination in eutheria depends on the x and y chromosomes  that evolved from a pair of autosomes less than  <dig> million years ago , after the divergence of the monotreme lineage  <cit> . acquisition of a sex-determining locus  transformed the ancestral autosomes to the proto-x/y  <cit>  and a subsequent stepwise suppression of meiotic recombination between x and y led to a male-specific region on the y-chr   <cit> . the remaining euchromatic region of the y-chr, the pseudoautosomal region , retains the ability to recombine with the x-chr during meiosis and shares the same genes and dna sequences with its x counterpart  <cit> . the y-chr, compared to the gene-rich  and highly conserved x-chr, has degenerated and lost more than 95% of ancestral genes, and is poorly conserved among mammalian lineages  <cit> . after recombination was suppressed with the x-chr, degeneration of the y-chr was driven by several synergistic evolutionary forces, including muller's ratchet, background selection, the hill robertson effect with weak selection and hitchhiking of deleterious alleles by favorable mutations  <cit> . independent y-chr decay during evolution  <cit>  led to different eutherian lineages retaining different subsets of y genes, and a diverse and lineage-specific y-chr gene content.

male-benefit genes have accumulated on the y-chr through persistence of genes derived from the proto-x/y  <cit> , transposition and retroposition from autosomes and subsequent amplification  <cit> . y-chr gene amplification with an attendant higher level of expression has been suggested to enhance gene function particularly beneficial to the male  <cit> . as a result, gene accumulation and amplification have provided the y-chr with a functional coherence in sex determination, spermatogenesis and fertility not observed in other regions of eutherian genomes  <cit> , with genes in msy showing remarkably uniform expression patterns either exclusively or predominantly in the testis  <cit> .

to date, several lineage-specific y-chr gene families, including the human daz, cdy, the mouse ssty <dig> and the cat tety <dig> and flj <dig>  have been reported  <cit> . daz and cdy appear as main candidates for the human azoospermia factor   <cit> . although these two primate lineage-specific y genes are autosomal in cattle and other non-primates, their functions in spermatogenesis and male fertility are highly conserved in the non-primate autosomal orthologs  <cit> .

causal reasons for the species-specific accumulation of y-genes remain elusive, as little information is available regarding the gene content of the y-chr in most eutherian mammals. we believed that the identification of species-specific y-genes in individual species will increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying gene acquisition and evolution, and offer insights into the genes central to regulation of male fertility and spermatogenesis.

the bovine  y-chr  was estimated to be ~ <dig> %  of the entire bovine genome   <cit> . the msy region comprises ~95% of btay, approximately 50% of which belongs to the euchromatic region   <cit> . previous studies on btay were based on a comparative mapping approach  <cit> , resulting in several y-linked genes, such as amely, ddx3y, sry, tspy, uty and zfy  <cit> . however, due to the limitation of the comparative mapping approach, lineage-specific y-chr gene has not been extensively analyzed in bovid.

the purpose of the present study is to investigate the msy region, and to identify and characterize the bovid lineage-specific y-chr gene. by using a direct testis cdna selection approach  <cit> , we discovered two bovine-specific y-chr gene families--znf280by  and znf280ay , which originated from a segmental duplication of their paralogs on the bovine chr  <dig>  and were subsequently amplified to over  <dig> copies on btay. to our knowledge, this is the first report on an autosome-to-y "gene block" transposition. the transposition and amplification of znf280b/znf280a on the bovid y-chr provides a fundamental model for further studying the expansion of multigene families on y-chr and for understanding the evolutionary force that shapes the gene functions.

RESULTS
identification of znf280by and znf280ay gene families
btay-expressed sequences were enriched by hybridizing a mixed testis cdna with a micro-dissected, pcr amplified, biotin-labeled btay probe  <cit> . the enriched btay cdnas were sequenced by two different technologies . among the  <dig> transcripts obtained from the sanger sequencing,  <dig>  matched to an unmapped bovine znf280b mrna  with a sequence similarity ranging from 97% to 100%. this mrna on the y-chr has differentiated and shares 93% sequence identity with znf280b on bta <dig> . assembly of ~ <dig> million short  reads from the next generation sequencing resulted in ~ <dig>  sequence contigs . one of the contigs is a full-length cdna  with 99% similarity to nm_ <dig>  another  <dig>  bp contig  is a paralog of the predicted bovine znf280a  with a sequence similarity of 91%. the bovine znf280b   and znf280a   genes map next to each other on the distal long arm  of bta <dig> . we have confirmed, by male-specific pcr, that the nm_ <dig> mrna and the two cdna contigs paralogous to either znf280b or znf280a are all y-linked in cattle . therefore, we referred these two genes as znf280by or znf280ay.

in the absence of a btay sequence assembly, we blast-searched znf280by  against all sequenced bovine bacterial artificial chromosomes  deposited in genbank  and identified  <dig> bacs  that contains a total of  <dig> copies of znf280by . a similar search with znf280ay  resulted in the identification of  <dig> bacs , which all contained the znf280by genes. all znf280ay-bacs harbor a single copy, except for one bac that contains two separate copies of znf280ay, resulting in a total of  <dig> copies of znf280ay. these results suggest that both znf280by and znf280ay are multi-copy gene families on btay.

point mutations and insertions/deletions  were found to be present in many of the znf280by copies based on sequence alignment and open reading frame  analyses, leading to  <dig> copies with short or no orfs. thus, they are pseudogenes. the remaining  <dig> copies, in which their orf varied from  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa, were predicted to be active at the transcription level using splign program  <cit>  . among all potential active znf280by loci,  <dig> contain the normal full-length mrna of  <dig>  bp , and encode a peptide of  <dig> aa, which is 87% identical to the znf280b protein on bta <dig> . the remaining  <dig> loci encode peptides of  <dig> to  <dig> aa, resulted from nonsense mutations or indels . two of the short peptides,  <dig> aa  and  <dig> aa , were investigated in details . all znf280bys have two exons with the coding segment  in exon  <dig>  the only intron in the znf280by family is located in the 5'-utr region,  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon, and varies in size ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb among type a, b, and c. the first exon of type c does not share any homology with type a or b . race  and rt-pcr analyses demonstrated that the type b contains a  <dig> bp insertion at nt  <dig> within the cds, leading to a frame shift and a stop codon  at nt  <dig>  and hence, a shorter peptide of  <dig> aa . type c has an  <dig> bp deletion at nt  <dig>  resulting in a premature stop codon  at nt  <dig> and a  <dig> aa peptide. in type b and c, only three and two zinc finger motifs were detected, respectively, while the normal znf280by  has four zinc finger motifs.

a series of analyses were carried out to verify whether the predicted active loci of znf280by are transcriptionally active. first, pairwise alignment of the znf280by cdna sequences obtained from the sanger sequencing with the y-bac genomic sequences identified  <dig> unique cdnas that match perfectly to one or more type a sequences , and two additional unique cdnas matched to type b and c, indicating at least  <dig> loci of znf280by are expressed in bovine testes . second, alignment of the znf280by-matched illumina reads  to each of the predicted znf280by loci revealed that at least  <dig> loci are transcriptionally active . since the results from sanger sequencing and illumina sequencing overlap ~80%, they complement each other. third, 5'- and 3'-race confirmed the expression of the znf280by type b and c. finally, multiple alignment of promoter sequences indicated that znf280by type a promoters are highly conserved . these results collectively suggest that all predicted znf280by loci on btay may be transcriptionally active.

for the bovine znf280ay gene family, the znf280ay cdna  contains a short orf . further analysis of all  <dig> znf280ay genomic sequences predicted short orfs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> aa, which are less than half the length of the protein encoded by znf280a . therefore, we speculate that all znf280ay loci on btay were pseudogenized. however, our illumina sequence analysis indicated that as many as  <dig> znf280ay loci  could be transcriptionally active, and that  <dig> of them were unquestionably expressed as they matched 100% with unique read pairs .

distribution of znf280by and znf280ay on btay
the distribution/duplication patterns of the znf280by and znf280ay loci on btay were identified by assembling a contig using the znf280by/ay-containing bacs deposited in genbank. these bacs were assembled under stringent criteria that assured overlaps between bacs were ≥ <dig> kb in size with ≥ <dig> % sequence identity. we obtained a  <dig>  mb contig of nine bacs using sequencher  <dig>    that contained  <dig> loci of znf280by , of which three were potentially coding and shared the same structure as znf280by type a, while the remainder were pseudogenes. interestingly, each active znf280by is accompanied by a pseudo znf280ay, forming a znf280by-znf280ay block with a  <dig> kb interval. the hsfy  and tspy  gene family also reside within this contig and amplified similarly to znf280by . the  <dig>  mb contig may represent a typical ampliconic region reflecting the redundant nature of btay dna.

interspersed repeats comprise ~58% of the  <dig>  mb contig and contain a high density of long interspersed repetitive elements  and retrotransposable elements , but low density of short interspersed repetitive elements , thus consistent with a previous report on the bovine genome  <cit> . two major directed repeats  are present in this region: dr <dig> and dr <dig> . dr <dig> contains three  <dig> kb repeat units , which are  <dig> % similar without considering gaps. dr <dig> has one znf280by pseudogene in each repetitive unit. dr1- <dig> and dr1- <dig> share an extra  <dig> kb extended repeat with  <dig> % similarity that contains one active znf280by. dr <dig> contains two  <dig> kb units which are  <dig> % similar, as well as pseudogene copies of znf280by. there are also two inverted repeats , ir <dig> and ir <dig>  over  <dig> % similar , which span  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb , respectively. one pseudogenized znf280by was detected in each arm of ir <dig>  but no znf280by sequence was present in ir <dig>  however, when the identity threshold of ir <dig> was lowered to  <dig> %, we were able to expand the length of ir <dig> to  <dig> kb and identify a znf280by pseudogene in each arm. the  <dig>  mb contig apparently contains multiple internally repeat units, with znf280by, znf280ay, hsfy and tspy representing the major gene families .

the origin of the znf280by-znf280ay block
in order to gain insight into the evolution of the znf280by and znf280ay gene families, we retrieved znf280b/by and znf280a/ay orthologous sequences from  <dig> mammalian species available to date  and conducted phylogenetic analysis. we found that the autosomal znf280b-znf280a gene block on bta <dig> is highly conserved among all sequenced eutherians , including human, chimpanzee, macaque, cow, dog, pig, and guinea pigs, and even in non-placental vertebrates  . however, znf280by/ay orthologs were identified only in bovid  y-chrs. the ovis aries y chromosome repeat region oy <dig>  dna sequence  was first deposited in genbank in  <dig>  and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization  to be conserved throughout bovidae  <cit> .

the oy <dig>  repeat sequence covers the znf280b , but not the znf280a   sequence. the similarity between the ovine and bovine znf280by is 88% at the nucleotide level and 86% at the protein level. due to the unfinished ovine genome sequencing, we were not able to retrieve the ovine znf280b, znf280a and znf280ay sequences in this study.

we built phylogenetic trees  for both gene families using neighbor-joining  and maximum-likelihood  methods. the topologies were consistent between the nj and ml tree. all predicted znf280by  cdnas  were grouped in a single cluster . the bovine znf280by gene family together with the ovine znf280by  were clustered with the bovine bta <dig> znf280b and formed one clade with a perfect bootstrap support . the autosomal orthologs of the bovine znf280b in eight mammalian species were clustered in a different clade, also with a strong bootstrap support  . the phylogenetic tree of the bovine znf280a/znf280ay  is very similar to the one of znf280b/znf280by, although mouse and rat were excluded in the analysis as their orthologous sequences were not available. the facts that the znf280b/znf280a gene block is located in a region of conserved synteny in eutherians and that the znf280by and znf280ay gene families are present in bovid only, strongly suggest that the y-linked families were a transposition of the autosomal  block. this autosome-to-y transposition event occurred most likely before the divergence of cattle and sheep, which was estimated to be ~ <dig>  mya  <cit> .

we estimated the age of the active znf280by loci by using the bovine and ovine znf280by sequences with the neutral rate estimates as the molecular clock . the mean ks value between bovine and ovine znf280by is  <dig> . the maximum pairwise ks value of the most distant znf280by locus  to the remaining active loci in bovine is  <dig> . based on the previous estimation of the divergence time of  <dig>  mya between the two species  <cit> , we estimated that the duplication events for the current active znf280by loci occurred approximately  <dig>  mya   <cit> .

the expression profile of znf280by and znf280ay
rt-pcr analyses revealed that znf280by expression is predominant in testis but low in liver, adrenal gland and lymph node, while the autosomal znf280b expression is specific to testis . the expression of znf280ay pseudogenes is high in spleen but low in testis and brain, while the znf280a expression was not detected among the nine tissues tested .

in situ hybridization  with znf280by indicated that the sense and antisense rna of this gene are expressed in adult testis . znf280by sense rna was widely expressed , but the antisense rna was detected only in the spermatids .

the expression of the sense and antisense rna of the znf280by over different stages of testis development  by qrt-pcr indicated the expression of znf280by sense rna increased significantly with age . in contrast, znf280by antisense rna expression was stable during testis development . it is noteworthy that expression between qrt-pcr replicates for the same individual at each stage  were highly consistent, whereas the levels between different individuals  varied, resulting in relatively high standard deviations .

to address the question of whether different loci of the znf280by families on btay are differentially expressed, we counted the number of read-pairs unique to a given locus . as shown in figure 3a, different loci of znf280by are differentially expressed with as much as 60-fold changes. similar analysis to the different copies of the znf280ay pseudogenes on btay indicated that their expression also varied as much as 10-fold . however, the expression level of the znf280ay pseudogenes is much lower  compared to the znf280by genes , which is consistent with the rt-pcr analysis .

discussion
autosome to y-chr transposition
autosome-to-y transposition of male fertility genes is a recurrent theme in mammalian y-chr evolution  <cit> . as a result, the content of male-beneficial genes in msy has increased in spite of a 95% loss of the ancestral y-chr genes due to the absence of recombination. autosome-to-y transposition events apparently occurred separately in different lineages with newly acquired y-chr genes from diverse genomic locations  <cit> . this resulted in lineage-specific y-chr genes  that account for a significant portion of the gene  variation among mammalian y-chrs. the human daz gene family was derived from the transposition of the autosomal dazl that maps to the sub-telomeric region on hsa3p <dig>   <cit> , while cdy arrived on the human y-chr through retrotransposition of cdyl on hsa <dig>  <cit>  during primate evolution. the mouse ssty <dig> was derived from a retroposition of an autosomal gene spin <dig> on mmu <dig>  <cit> . the feline flj36031and tety <dig> gene families originated through autosome-to-y transposition before and after the divergence of cats and dogs, respectively  <cit> .

in addition to autosome-to-y transpositions, a massive x-to-y sequence transposition has also been observed in humans, which occurred after the human and chimpanzee divergence  and resulted in an x-transposed sequence block on the y that contains two single-copy genes, tgif2ly and pcdh11y  <cit> . this block of the y-chr sequence still shares a high similarity with the x-counterpart  though it does not recombine during meiosis  <cit> .

we identified two novel y-chr gene families, znf280by and znf280ay, which are present on both bovine and ovine y-chrs, but not on non-bovid y-chrs investigated to date. we propose that the znf280by/ay gene families are lineage-specific in bovidae. phylogenetic analysis of the znf280b/by and znf280a/ay family  strongly support that the bovine znf280by/ay originated from the autosomal genes, znf280b/a, on bta <dig>  unlike the human daz and feline tety <dig> and flj <dig> genes, where a single autosomal gene is involved in the transposition, the bovine znf280b/a transposed to the y-chr as a block. this autosomal block is located in the sub-telomeric region that could be a hotspot for segmental duplication  <cit> .

znf280by-znf280ay amplification and the "birth-and-death" evolution
the distribution pattern and differences in copy number suggest that znf280by-znf280ay was differentially amplified on btay after transposition. we identified  <dig> active znf280by and  <dig> pseudogenes from btay-bacs, and estimated that the oldest active znf280by locus emerged via a duplication event ~ <dig>  mya. this is significantly later than the estimated divergence time of  <dig>  mya between cattle and sheep  <cit> . the results lead us to believe that the progressive amplification of the bovine znf280by follows the "birth-and-death" model of evolution  <cit> . based on this model, new znf280by loci were created by repeated gene duplication with some duplicated genes maintained on the btay and others lost due to mutation and degeneration, as active gene copies might cooperate to increase the efficiency of male fertility and damage to a few copies would not significantly impact the biological system  <cit> . each of the three active znf280by loci in the  <dig>  mb region is accompanied by a znf280ay pseudogene . if this is true for all  <dig> active znf280by loci, we should expect to identify a minimum of  <dig> znf280ay pseudogenes. interestingly, the observed  <dig> copies of znf280ay pseudogenes in this study are very close to the expected number, but we do not, as yet, know whether co-amplification of the znf280by-znf280ay or the loss of the znf280ay in the gene pair has any role in the activity of znf280by.

a significant feature of the human msy is the eight palindromes  with arm-to-arm sequence identities ≥ <dig> %  <cit> . y-to-y gene conversion between the paired-genes on each arm occurs frequently in humans, constraining sequence divergence and maintaining the critical functions of the msy genes  <cit> . pairwise comparisons of all available btay-bacs and the assembly of a  <dig>  mb ampliconic region located in msy revealed several palindrome-like inverted repeats with an arm-to-arm identity of  <dig> % . the occurrence of palindrome-like irs indicates that the y-y gene conversion mechanism may apply to these gene families. when the criteria for sequence assembly was lowered from  <dig> % to  <dig> % identity, and the minimum overlap size between bacs decreased from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb, we obtained another large contig  from different y-bacs displaying similar dot-plot and repeat pattern as the  <dig>  mb contig . it appears that the majority of the bovine msy ampliconic region is enriched with internally repetitive units containing znf280by, znf280ay, hsfy and tspy.

locus-specific expression of multi-copy genes on the y-chr
one of the most important features of mammalian y-chrs is the multi-copy gene families that are exclusively expressed in testis and play essential roles in spermatogenesis and male fertility. the largest y-gene family reported to date is tspy, which is conserved on most of the mammalian y-chrs. the human y-chr harbors 20- <dig> copies of tspy  <cit> , while the bovine y-chr has 50- <dig> copies  <cit> . unlike the human tspys that are clustered as a tandem array in a narrow region  on yp  <cit> , the bovine tspys spread over the majority of the msy ampliconic region. recent studies in tspy copy number variation  has indicated that cnv significantly influenced spermatogenic efficiency in men  <cit> . however, efforts to study the expression profile of the multi-copy y-chr genes have been impeded because of the high similarity  among different copies . in this work, we have successfully applied the deep sequencing technology to analyze the locus-specific expression of the znf280by and znf280ay gene families. we believe that there are two important advantages with the deep sequencing approach. first, by counting the perfectly matched read pairs, one can directly evaluate the expression level of any given locus . second, one can also compare the average expression level among gene families or individuals  based on read counts. we expect that the combination of cnv and locus-specific expression analyses on these y-gene families, including znf280by, znf280ay, hsfy, and tspy, will help us to understand how multi-copy gene families regulate and function during spermatogenesis.

potential function in spermatogenesis
although zinc finger proteins are among the most abundant and functionally diverse in mammalian genomes  <cit> , little is known of the functions of znf280b in mammals. the drosophila ortholog, suppressor of hairy-wing , is a transcriptional regulator. the su protein has been found to bind an insulator element within a gypsy retrotransposon to mediate enhancer-blocking of gypsy towards target genes  <cit> . the conserved syntenic block znf280b-znf280a on hsa <dig> is located within the lambda light chain loci and is reportedly associated with immune responsiveness  <cit> .

the discovery of the autosome-to-y transposition and subsequent amplification of the znf280by-znf280ay gene block on btay led us to suggest that the two gene families may play an essential role in spermatogenesis. a comparable example is the ssty <dig> gene family in mice which is significantly amplified  after retroposing to the y-chr and is expressed specifically in spermatids with a function in sperm differentiation  <cit> . as expected, we found that the bovine znf280by family predominantly and znf280b specifically expressed in testes . the significant age related elevation of znf280by levels  may be associated with the maturation of the bovine testes and cell proliferation throughout spermatogenesis. antisense rna may play a role in regulating the expression of znf280by during spermatogenesis . the antisense transcripts of znf280by were over-expressed relative to sense transcripts in testes ≤ <dig> months of age . this observation is in contrast to a previous report that found lower antisense versus sense transcript levels in genes expressed in germ cells  <cit> . the antisense rnas of the three y-related and testis-expressed genes in cattle, including znf280by, ddx3y and cdyl, all appear to be expressed in the late stage of spermatocytes and/or spermatids, indicating that antisense rna is important in regulating bovine spermatogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of lineage-specific y genes recapitulates the diversity of y gene content and signifies the importance of comparative studies of the mammalian y-chr. this study provides a base for further research on y-chr evolution and male-fertility. as the expression of the bovine znf280b/znf280by and znf280a/znf280ay is predominant in the testis, their autosomal orthologs in other eutherians may play roles in spermatogenesis. we believe that additional functional analysis of znf280b/znf280by and znf280a/znf280ay will offer insights into gene regulation in spermatogenesis, the evolution of the mammalian y-chr and advance the assembly of the bovine y-chr sequence.
