BACKGROUND
our genome is replete with l <dig> retrotransposon-derived sequences that can affect the transcriptome . genomic l <dig> sequences propagate through rna intermediates. their lifecycle begins with transcription from the 5’ l <dig> promoter; this is followed by reverse transcription of the l <dig> rna and insertion of the l <dig> cdna sequence into the genome  <cit> . there are two broad classes of l1s. first is the less numerous class of full-length  l <dig> retrotransposon sequences with intact internal promoters, of which there are approximately  <dig>  copies in the human genome  <cit> . a subset of these with intact coding sequences for open reading frame  <dig> protein  and orf2p is potentially retrotransposition competent, and these elements are mostly specific to our species   <cit> . second is the much more numerous and heterogeneous class of mutated or truncated l <dig>  which includes both species-specific and ancient insertions. these insertions included 5’ truncations with or without internal rearrangements at the time of their insertion. depending on their length and mutation load these sequences may have no promoter activity or protein-coding capability  <cit> .

it is estimated that there are approximately  <dig> full-length, retrotransposition competent l1hs in the human genome with intact internal promoters and open-reading frames  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> of the  <dig> full-length older l1pa <dig> are potentially active  <cit> . the estimates are based on the length of the l <dig> insertions, the integrity of their open reading frame sequences, and results of in vitro retrotransposition assays that may use an ectopic promoter to drive l <dig> expression. however, sequence requirements for l <dig> promoter activity have not been well defined.

activity of the l <dig> antisense promoter  was first demonstrated by speek who described the discovery of four chimeric l <dig> asp transcripts, comprised of l1-derived 5’-utr and spliced exons from neighboring single-copy genes  <cit> . speek and colleagues also showed that l <dig> asp activity can drive tissue-specific transcription of chimeric transcripts in a few instances  <cit> . subsequently, much work focused on the met oncogene locus and the associated l1-met chimeric transcript  <cit> . the l1-met chimeric transcript initiates within the second intron of the met gene and downstream of the translational start site. overexpression of the l1-met chimeric transcript causes decreased full-length met protein levels and met-dependent signaling perhaps through transcriptional interference  <cit> . similarly, transcriptional derepression of the l <dig> chimeric transcript lct <dig> was linked to silencing of its cognate transcript tfpi- <dig>  a tumor suppressor in a variety of human malignancies  <cit> .

in another approach to identify chimeric l <dig> asp transcripts, cruickshanks and tufarelli applied l <dig> chimera display to identify eighteen novel chimeric l <dig> asp transcripts, some of which were selectively detected in breast and colon cancer specimens but not in matched normal tissues  <cit> . these investigators also showed that dna methylation limits the activity of l <dig> asp in normal tissues and that 5-aza-cytidine treatment of established cancer cell lines causes expression of chimeric l <dig> asp transcripts  <cit> . other studies have found evidence of antisense expression in more ancient l <dig> elements. macia et al. found that more ancient primate l <dig> elements including l1pa2- <dig> were capable of antisense transcription  <cit> . faulkner et al. identified transcription start sites of cap-selected rnas and found that l <dig> fragments displayed antisense expression at the 3’ end of the l <dig> element  <cit> .

the human-specific subfamily l1hs and the primate specific subfamilies l1pa2- <dig> were identified to contain an open reading frame termed orf <dig> that is transcribed downstream of the l <dig> asp on the antisense strand  <cit> . the orf <dig> is typically translated as a short peptide and locates to promyelocytic leukemia-adjacent nuclear bodies in the cytoplasm  <cit> . there are ~ <dig> genic loci encoding l <dig> orf <dig>  which is typically encoded completely within the l <dig> asp sequence. a rare fraction,  <dig> of ~3200 l <dig> orf <dig> loci, encodes a peptide where orf <dig> was observed to be fused to a gene exon  <cit> .

although the existence of l <dig> asp transcripts is well-documented, many questions remain. the extent to which l <dig> chimeric antisense transcripts impact the human transcriptome and what other genes may be under the influence of l <dig> asp is unknown. the importance of these l <dig> asp transcripts is further highlighted by the recent identification of orf <dig>  which suggests chimeric l <dig> gene fusion transcripts might be expressed. herein, we report the identification and comprehensive characterization of  <dig> putative l <dig> asp transcripts.

RESULTS
identification of many novel l <dig> asp transcripts
we queried human expressed sequence tag  genome alignments to identify ests incorporating part of an l <dig> sequence in the asp. first, we required that the transcription start site  of a spliced human est begins in the antisense orientation relative to an annotated l <dig> element and second, that a spliced exon of the est must also overlap an annotated exon of a gene. third, we removed putative l <dig> asp transcripts where an independent est supported l <dig> exonization, rather than transcription starting from within the l <dig> element. we implemented the third criterion because ests are not full-length transcripts and gene transcripts can retain intronic l1s on the opposite strand because l1s contain cryptic splice sites  <cit> . we used bedtools to conduct intersections and identified  <dig> ests supporting putative l <dig> asp transcripts . only a small fraction of ests,  <dig>  % or 46/ <dig>  was annotated by the ucsc-spliced human est database to map to multiple locations in the genome, with at least one these locations not matching our criteria. the  <dig> ests map to exon sequences of  <dig> genes . we identified 45/ <dig> previously known published l <dig> asp transcripts  and confirmed existence of 37/ <dig> deposited on c-gate  <cit> , a publicly available project on genes affected by transposable elements . the vast majority, 911/ <dig>  of l <dig> asp transcripts in our survey are novel. the ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts were identified on every human chromosome, although the y chromosome that is gene poor displayed relatively few chimeric transcripts .fig.  <dig> identification of novel l <dig> antisense promoter  transcripts using a computational pipeline. a schematic representation of our method to identify l <dig> asp transcripts. the coordinates of human spliced ests were intersected with l1s and gene exons to identify ests with a tss antisense to an l <dig> and overlapping an exon of a cognate gene. l <dig> asp transcripts that displayed an independent est supporting l <dig> exonization were removed. b total number of l <dig> asp transcripts identified in the current report  cross-referenced to known existing l <dig> asp transcripts found in published reports including recently identified l <dig> orf <dig> gene fusions and the c-gate database. c histogram of the total number of ests identified per gene for l <dig> asp transcripts 



properties of l <dig> asp transcripts
of the l <dig> asp transcripts,  <dig> were represented by only one est, which suggests that many l <dig> asp transcripts are transcribed at relatively low levels. the remaining  <dig> transcripts were represented by multiple ests . the top three most widely expressed l <dig> asp transcripts were associated with cpm , bcas <dig> , and ddx39b . interestingly, l1-cpm has not been previously identified. we next annotated the identified l <dig> asp transcripts by the subfamily of l <dig> that contained the asp. remarkably, we found that, of the  <dig> identified ests, only 52/ <dig>  or  <dig>  % of all of the transcripts, originate from the evolutionarily young l1hs subfamily . the vast majority, 626/ <dig> or  <dig>  %, originate from pre-ta, primate-specific l <dig> subfamilies and 1337/ <dig> or  <dig>  % originate from older mammalian l <dig> subfamilies. the prevalence of evolutionarily ancient and mutated l1s as a source of l <dig> asp transcripts was unexpected and suggests the possible exaptation of the l <dig> sequences over evolutionary time.fig.  <dig> l <dig> subfamily and tissue distributions of l <dig> asp transcripts. a evolutionary age of l <dig> subfamilies indicates a role for most l <dig> evolutionary subtypes in genesis of l <dig> asp transcripts. b characterization of source material used for ests cdna that support l <dig> asp transcripts. c tissue source for ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts identified in hyper-proliferative or cancerous samples. d normal tissue sources for ests used to identify l <dig> asp transcripts



next, we reviewed the primary tissues  and cell lines  that were sources of ests, and categorized them as cancerous  or normal  . some ests could not be characterized due to a lack of supporting information. interestingly,  <dig>  % of ests supporting an l <dig> asp transcript originated from non-cancerous tissues . for ests derived from cancerous tissue, the most prevalent sources were embryonic carcinoma cells , head/neck tissue , and fibrosarcoma cells  . l <dig> asp transcripts in normal tissue were primarily identified from brain or testis tissues. our analysis supports the notion that l <dig> asp transcripts are readily detectable in both normal and diseased states. however, due to source tissue biases in the est database, we cannot conclude the l <dig> asp promoter activity is higher overall in the brain or testis. finally, we conducted a gene ontology  analysis of the  <dig> cognate genes that contained putative l <dig> asp transcripts. the results of our go analysis showed overrepresentation of genes involved in diverse cellular processes including vesicle-mediated transport, intracellular protein transport, mitosis, morphogenesis, and protein modifications .

we next examined the relationship of ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts to their overlapping cognate genes. some of the  <dig> ests overlapped multiple genes; in total, we identified  <dig> pairwise overlaps between the ests and an annotated gene exon. we found that the vast majority of chimeric transcripts, 2134/ <dig> or  <dig>  %, were sense to the nearby gene, a proportion that was highly statistically significant ; on the contrary, only 182/ <dig> or  <dig>  % were in the antisense orientation. we examined the distance from the est transcription start site  to the tss of the cognate gene in these two categories. the l <dig> asp transcripts sense to their cognate genes was typically downstream of the gene tss. thus, the l <dig> provides an alternative start site and produces a transcript in which the annotated 5’utr or first coding exon is not included . all of the l <dig> asp transcripts that were on the strand opposite from the cognate gene were downstream of the gene tss . this minor category of l <dig> asp transcripts extended and overlapped antisense to the exon of the cognate gene.fig.  <dig> most l <dig> asp transcripts are sense to cognate genes and possess protein coding potential. a l <dig> asp transcripts tend to be in sense strandedness relative to the cognate gene, typically serving as an alternative tss of the canonical gene tss . rarely, ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts overlap anti-sense to cognate gene . the bias towards sense-strandedness of l <dig> asp transcripts suggested the possibility for protein coding potential. ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts that had multiple alignments in the database  were excluded. b independent analysis of long-read pacbio rna-seq data identified transcript isoforms supporting 124/988 l <dig> asp transcripts. we validated both instances where the l <dig> asp transcript was sense to the cognate gene . we also validated the opposite strand l <dig> asp transcript . the red indicates the positive strand and the blue indicates the negative strand for the genome browser view. c coding potential of l <dig> asp transcripts was assessed by the ability to encode an open reading frame  of at least  <dig> amino acids  and to begin with a start codon. we identified that  <dig>  % of ests contained the potential for coding by these criteria



to further validate l <dig> asp transcripts we examined publicly available long-read rna-seq data from human embryonic stem cells  sequenced using a pacific biosciences  instrument  <cit> . the rna-seq reads generated by pacbio are long , but are lower quality. therefore, au k. et al. error corrected the long-read pacbio rna-seq reads using short read illumina rna-seq data  <cit> . subsequently, the error corrected long rna-seq data was used for isoform detection by au k. et al. to identify expressed transcripts in h1-escs  <cit> . we used the publicly available transcript isoform prediction for h1-escs to validate l <dig> asp transcripts identified by our est screen. we were able to validate 124/ <dig> or  <dig>  % of the l <dig> asp transcripts reported here as expressed in h1-escs . thus, using low coverage rna-seq data from a single cell-line we were able to independently validate  <dig>  % of the l <dig> asp transcripts we identified.

next we sought to address the coding potential of l <dig> asp transcripts because the majority was sense to the cognate gene and could potentially contain open reading frames . we applied transdecoder software to identify putative peptides encoded by ests with at least  <dig> amino acids   <cit> . we also required that the predicted putative peptide begin with a start codon encoding methionine and identified that 546/ <dig> or  <dig>  % of the ests contained the potential for coding putative peptides . the identified putative peptides ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> aa, with an average putative peptide length of  <dig> aa . of the identified putative peptides  <dig> contained fragments of the recently identified orf <dig> open reading frame protein  <cit> . however, because we only included spliced ests and orf <dig> is contained within the unspliced 5’ utr of l1hs we did not identify a full-length orf <dig>  <cit> . however, it is important to note that in the absence of additional experimental data these are only peptide predictions. in summary, l <dig> asp transcripts are predicted to contain putative peptides that extend from the l <dig> asp into cognate genes.

characterization of the l <dig> asp
next we compared the l <dig> asp transcription start sites to the l <dig> consensus sequences. we aligned the  <dig> ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts to full-length consensus sequences in repbase and those reported by khan et al.  <cit> . we divided the l1s by evolutionary age, examining the most recent human l1hs, less recent primate l1pa2- <dig>  more ancient primate l <dig>  and ancient mammalian l <dig> subfamilies. we observed that the ests mapping to l1hs elements aligned within the first 600 bp of the 5’ utr antisense to the l <dig> consensus sequence . the locations of the l1hs antisense tss within the 5’ utr were consistent with prior descriptions of l <dig> asp transcripts  <cit> . recent primate l1pa2- <dig> elements that are highly homologous to l1hs in the 5’ utr  <cit>  also displayed l <dig> asp activity in an identical location to l1hs . however, older primate l1s and ancient mammalian l1s displayed only minor l <dig> antisense activity in the 5’ utr and the majority of activity was in the 3’ end of the element overlapping orf <dig> . our result is consistent with a prior report demonstrating that l <dig> fragments display asp activity at the 3’ end of the element  <cit> .fig.  <dig> features of the l <dig> antisense promoter revealed from ests, encode chip-seq, and gro-seq data. a ests supporting alternative l <dig> asp transcripts for l1hs, l1pa2- <dig>  ancient primate l <dig>  and ancient mammalian l <dig> subfamilies were aligned to full-length l <dig> consensus sequences. the plot revealed evolutionarily recent l1hs and l1pa2- <dig> subfamilies possess the asp activity in the 5’ utr, whereas ancient primate and ancient mammalian l <dig> subfamilies display minor asp activity in the 5’ utr and the majority is at the 3’ end of the element overlapping the end of orf <dig>  b yy <dig> enrichment profile in the 5’utr of l1hs consensus sequence for encode yy <dig> chip-seq in various cell-lines. the schematic above is a reference point to the l1hs consensus position. c the tss enrichment profile for yy <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  and h3k9me <dig> chip-seq for l1hs and l1pa2- <dig> as ests in units of input subtracted reads per million mapping reads  using the k <dig> cell-line. the bottom panel displays the gro-seq tss enrichment profile in rpm enrichment units. the schematic above is a reference point to the l1hs consensus position



we further interrogated ests from recent primate l1pa2- <dig> subfamilies and the human l1hs subfamily for transcription factors that might drive transcription from the asp  <cit> . yy <dig> is the best characterized cis-regulatory transcription factor proposed to be required for l <dig> transcription from the sense promoter  <cit> . yy <dig> was previously reported to bind between  <dig> and 21 bp of l1hs 5’ utr on the antisense strand . interestingly, yy <dig> is also an important regulator of bidirectional transcription at the promoters of multiple single-copy genes  <cit> . to examine the possibility that yy <dig> could play a role in the l <dig> asp, we sought to better characterize yy <dig> binding to the l1hs 5’ utr. first, we applied jaspar scan to examine the 5’ utr of the l1hs consensus sequence for yy <dig> transcription factor-binding sites using a relative score of at least 90 %  <cit> . we identified five putative binding sites based on yy <dig> position weight matrices, including two that overlapped the proposed binding site  and three additional binding sites . next, we examined yy <dig> transcription factor binding to the l1hs consensus sequence using chip-seq data available for yy <dig> from the encode project  <cit> . for all of the encode cell lines, we identified two peaks that displayed enrichment for yy1: the first, peak- <dig>  corresponded to the known yy <dig> binding site at ~20 bp; the second, peak- <dig>  was at ~450 bp in the l1hs 5’ utr . peak- <dig> overlaps closely with an identified putative yy <dig> binding site on the positive strand at  <dig> to 453 bp, which immediately precedes the primary l <dig> asp at ~400 bp. . the secondary binding site of yy <dig> near the primary l <dig> asp suggests that yy <dig> may play a role in regulating l <dig> antisense transcription.

to test whether tss locations of l <dig> asp transcripts were bound by yy <dig> and marked by histone modifications, we examined encode chip-seq alignments to the human genome . we reviewed chip data for yy <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> histone modifications in the k <dig>  h1-esc, and hela cell-lines  <cit> . the histone modifications h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> are typically associated with euchromatic, active or poised promoters . we found that the ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts displayed modest enrichment for yy <dig> at the tss in encode . peak- <dig> for yy <dig>  identified in fig. 4b, directly overlapped near the tss of the ests supporting l <dig> asp transcripts. immediately downstream of the tss, based on transcription orientation, we identified modest enrichment for histone marks h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> in k <dig>  h1-esc, and hela cell-lines . we next examined global run-on sequencing  data, a high-throughput nuclear run-on assay that can identify 5’-capped rnas . we found that gro-seq sequencing reads were mapped to the tss of the majority of l <dig> antisense ests in k <dig>  mcf <dig>  and hela cell-lines . together, this data supports that yy <dig> binds to the l <dig> asp in addition to the previously characterized binding site near the sense promoter. additionally, analysis of histone modifications associated with active or poised promoters and gro-seq data suggests that the l <dig> asps we identified are likely to be actively transcribed in a variety of cell types.

validation of l <dig> asp transcripts
we selected two genes associated with l <dig> asp transcripts for sanger sequence-based confirmation. we successfully detected l <dig> asp transcripts associated with both kiaa1324l and uvrag genes . sanger sequenced reads across l1-kiaa1324l and l1-uvrag transcripts revealed that l <dig> antisense was fused in frame to kiaa1324l and uvrag. we compared our list of genes associated with l <dig> asp transcripts to the genes causally implicated in human malignancies annotated by the cosmic database  <cit> . we identified  <dig> implicated causal cancer-associated genes with l <dig> asp transcripts, including l1-met, l1-jak <dig>  l1-nf <dig>  l1-prkar1a, and l1-rhoa . apart from l1-met and l1-cbfa2t <dig>  the other  <dig> cancer-associated l <dig> asp transcripts have not previously been described. interestingly, l1-nf <dig> expression in normal human tissues closely resembled the expression of cognate cancer-associated gene nf <dig> . the validation of the l <dig> antisense transcript for sec22b also showed that the transcript was expressed at levels near wild-type cognate sec22b transcripts . the l1-sec22b and l1-nf <dig> were each supported by one est, whereas ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> spliced ests corresponded to the wild type sec22b and nf <dig> transcript, respectively. the discrepancy between est ratios and quantitative rt-pcr results can be explained by the heterologous mixture of tissues and cdna library size used as source material for ests. many ests supporting the wild-type transcripts have identical alignment coordinates and are from the same cdna library. these issues complicate the quantitation of est ratios and make comparison of these ratios to the quantitative rt-pcr results difficult to interpret. although we note this discrepancy, the validation of 4/4 l <dig> asp transcripts by quantitative rt-pcr and sanger sequencing supports that the screen identified many new and undescribed chimeric transcripts that are driven by the l <dig> asp.fig.  <dig> validation of selected l <dig> asp transcripts by combined pcr and sanger-sequencing methods. a upper panel: genome browser view of kiaa1324l genomic locus displaying the ests supporting l1- kiaa1324l. middle panel: representative pcr product obtained by pcr amplification with l1-specific primer and kiaa1324l-specific primer. lower panel: selected sanger sequencing read across l <dig> to kiaa1324l exon  <dig> boundary; blue letters denote l <dig> as promoter sequence, orange letters denote kiaa1324l exon  <dig> sequence. b empirical validation of l1-uvrag, with same orientation as figure 5a

l <dig> asp transcripts overlapping l <dig> exonized transcripts
the method to identify l <dig> asp transcripts implemented a criterion to remove ests where an independent est suggested l <dig> exonization . we examined this category in more detail and report these putative transcripts separately . many of these events cannot be unambiguously assigned as an l <dig> antisense transcript due to the presence of an est also supporting l <dig> exonization. however, we observed transcripts where the majority of ests supported l <dig> asp driven transcription rather than l <dig> exonization . we also observed events where ests supporting l <dig> asp driven transcripts and ests supporting l <dig> exonization were non-overlapping . therefore, in some cases l1s might contribute both to l <dig> asp driven transcripts and l <dig> exonized transcripts.

identification of mouse l <dig> asp transcripts
in the mouse genome line- <dig> elements are also active, yet they are quite different from the human l1hs subfamily at the sequence level. nevertheless, active mouse line- <dig> elements contain an l <dig> asp also capable of yielding fusion transcripts  <cit> . unlike the human l1hs subfamily, which contains the l <dig> asp in the 5’ utr, the mouse asp is within the first open reading frame   <cit> . we applied our bioinformatic approach to identified spliced ests consistent with an l <dig> antisense transcript in the mouse genome. the results for the mouse are an underestimate because unlike human ests many of the mouse ests in the spliced alignment database did not contain transcript orientation. however, despite our strict filtering we identified l <dig> asp transcripts for  <dig> cognate genes that were supported by  <dig> ests . of the  <dig> identified l <dig> asp transcripts  <dig> corresponded to the mouse-specific line- <dig> retrotransposon subfamilies . surprisingly, we again identified a subset of evolutionarily ancient l <dig> subfamilies that were transcribing an l <dig> antisense transcript, which we also identified in human. the l <dig> asp transcript shisa <dig> was identified within both the human and mouse genomes transcribed antisense to shared mammalian l1m <dig> .

discussion
here, we present one of the most comprehensive studies of l <dig> asp transcripts in the human genome. we describe in total  <dig> chimeric transcripts of which  <dig> are novel, where the l <dig> asp drives the expression of a transcript that is spliced to a gene exon; and they are collectively supported by  <dig> ests. because we required evidence of splicing at the alignment level, our identified l <dig> antisense ests correspond to processed transcripts. thus, the number of putative transcripts is almost certainly an underestimate. this is supported by the fact that other published studies using complementary approaches identified  <dig> additional putative l <dig> asp transcripts we did not recover.

the l <dig> sense promoter has higher transcriptional activity in many cancers, and increased l <dig> orf <dig> expression and protein abundance is often observed  <cit> . high levels of l <dig> somatic retrotransposition are also readily detectable in a variety of cancers and during the early stages of tumorigenesis . we identified 20 l <dig> asp driven transcripts that affect cancer genes, including previously reported l1-met  <cit> . while we expected to identify an increased number of l <dig> asp transcripts from cancer specimens, the majority of ests found in this survey were identified in normal tissues. this is unlikely due to a bias in the est database, which contains a preponderance of cdnas from cancerous tissue and diseased states. our analysis revealed that the brain, testis, placenta, embryonic tissues, and lungs were the most abundant contributors of ests supporting l <dig> antisense transcription.

about 27 % of the l <dig> asp transcripts we describe occur in the sense orientation to the cognate gene and are predicted to produce a peptide of at least  <dig> amino acids in length. whether l <dig> asp transcripts yield translated proteins remains an open question. however, recent characterization of orf <dig> and  <dig> instances of orf <dig> gene exon fusions supports that a subset of transcripts identified here are likely translated  <cit> . interestingly, some l <dig> asp transcripts seem to match an annotated gene transcript; in those cases the gene tss starts in the l <dig> asp, an example being uvrag.

in contrast, about 73 % of the l <dig> asp transcripts are not predicted to encode a putative peptide by our metric. the absence of a predicted putative peptide of  <dig> amino acids has been previously used to define a transcript as a long non-coding  rna . however, although atypical, some proteins with less than  <dig> amino acids reside in mammalian genomes  <cit> . an important example of a short peptide that would not be identified by this analysis is orf <dig>  which is only  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . hence, our putative peptide prediction does not preclude the possibility that additional l <dig> asp transcripts are potentially protein coding. in addition, because our identification is based on ests, which are not typically full-length transcripts, our current list might represent an underestimate of l <dig> asp transcript putative predicted peptides.

we also describe l <dig> asp transcripts incorporating gene sequences in the antisense orientation. such transcripts are rare, comprising less than 8 % of our total, but may be biologically important. where expressed, these have the potential to produce double-stranded rnas because they encode a transcript with reverse complementarity to a portion of the cognate mrna . the dsrna may impact epigenetic regulation at the locus and the stability of the mrna  <cit> .

nearly all of the l1hs and l1pa2- <dig> antisense ests, subfamilies with a homologous 5’ utr, display asp activity within the first 600 bp of the l <dig> 5’ utr, whereas more ancient primate and mammalian l1s display the majority of asp activity at the 3’ end of the element near the end of orf <dig>  this observation explains a previous result indicating that l <dig> fragments display asp activity at the 3’ end of the l <dig> element  <cit> . in addition, this result clarifies how the majority of ancient l1s, which are typically 5’ truncated, can contribute the majority of l <dig> asp activity. we identified substantial evidence that l <dig> asps are transcriptionally active. there was binding of regulatory elements including the transcription factor yy <dig> at the l <dig> asp. the transcription factor yy <dig> displayed a double peak binding distribution within the l <dig> promoter. yy <dig> transcription factor peak- <dig> in fig. 4-c corresponds to the position of the l <dig> sense promoter and has been described previously  <cit> . yy <dig> transcription factor peak- <dig> is newly identified and seems to overlap the position of the l <dig> asp; however, binding of yy <dig> to peak- <dig> does not necessarily indicate a functional role. unlike yy <dig> the gro-seq and histone mark chip-seq profiles display a single peak distribution within the l <dig> promoter . the single gro-seq peak overlaps yy <dig> peak- <dig> at the site which is likely the tss for the l <dig> asp. the predicted tss position is also marked downstream by histone modifications h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> which is characteristic of active promoters. the gro-seq profiles are consistent with 5’ capped rnas initiating from this l <dig> asp tss. whether the yy <dig> peak- <dig> is required for l <dig> asp transcription at the identified tss warrants further investigation. independent validation of 124/988 l <dig> asp transcripts using pacbio long read rna-seq suggested expression of a large subset of identified transcripts in embryonic stem cells. together, several lines of evidence indicate these transcription start sites function as active promoters.

the l <dig> asp was likely active at multiple points in mammalian evolution. while ancient subfamilies are no longer competent for retrotransposition they are contributing to the transcriptome through promoter activity. similarly, in the mouse, l1_mus1- <dig> subfamilies also contribute to new l <dig> asp transcripts. the mouse element contains the asp in orf1p  <cit> . while the sequence differs dramatically between human and mouse l1s, the functional conservation of asp activity indicates selective pressure to preserve this feature. it is interesting to speculate as to whether the l <dig> asp activity benefits the host or the l <dig> element fitness. there is some evidence that the l <dig> asp transcripts might produce sirnas to repress the l <dig> sense transcript  <cit> . contradicting this view is new evidence that orf <dig> transcribed from the asp is correlated with the transposition competent sense transcript  <cit> . lastly, there are more instances being identified of transposons being exapted for normal cellular functions by the host  <cit> . the fact that some ancient mammalian l <dig> elements are conserved in diverse mammals from human to mouse provides support to the hypothesis that l <dig> asp transcripts may be exapted for functional roles.

perhaps one of the most interesting and easily testable ramifications stemming from identification of such a large number of l <dig> asp transcripts is that some are likely to be polymorphic in the human population. some of the transcripts identified here are likely to be absent in at least some individuals in the human population. by extension, there are likely polymorphic l <dig> transposition events present in the population but absent from the reference genome that would also likely contribute to l <dig> asp transcripts. it would be of interest to determine allele frequency for a handful of chosen l <dig> asp transcripts. for instance, is the putative l1-met chimeric transcript polymorphic, and does it segregate with any observable phenotype? the expanded repertoire of l <dig> asp transcripts described herein could exert numerous effects on gene regulation that remain to be investigated.

methods
computational detection of putative l <dig> asp transcripts
we identified candidate l <dig> asp transcripts by applying a series of intersections on genomic intervals of three annotations obtained using the ucsc table browser tool in browser extensible data  format. first, we downloaded the locations of l <dig> elements by extracting the coordinates of all line- <dig> family repeats from the repeatmasker  annotation  <cit> . second, we downloaded the annotated exon coordinates of refseq genes . third, we downloaded the coordinates of ucsc human spliced ests, a table containing the alignment coordinates of ests displaying evidence of splicing, as a block feature  and as coordinates of spliced est exons . importantly, the strand field in the ucsc human spliced ests table reflects the alignment direction  of the est cdna to the genome by blat and does not reflect the transcriptional direction. to convert the strand in the ucsc human spliced ests database to reflect transcriptional direction, we used the linked ucsc estorientinfo table. if the value of the intronorientation field in the associated table is positive, the transcriptional direction matches the alignment direction; however, if the intronorientation field is negative, the strandedness is opposite. sometimes, a call cannot be determined for est transcriptional direction because the intronorientation field is zero; these ambiguous cases were removed manually from subsequent analyses. for mouse we used a similar set of annotations: repeatmasker , refseq genes , and the ucsc mouse spliced ests . for the mouse annotation, a larger fraction of cases were ambiguous and removed because the intronorientation field was zero and transcriptional direction could not be determined.

next, we defined criteria to identify putative l <dig> asp transcripts. the 5’ tss of the est was required to originate from within an annotated l <dig> element, and the transcriptional direction strand of the est was required to be antisense to the l <dig>  second, an exon coordinate of the est was required to overlap with an annotated exon coordinate of a gene. third, we excluded l <dig> asp transcripts where an independent est supported l <dig> exonization . we selected ests that met this criteria and represented l <dig> asp transcripts using sequential intersections performed with bedtools  <cit> . to verify the accuracy of the selection method, we manually inspected putative l <dig> asp transcripts using the ucsc genome browser. manual inspection identified a subset of ests that contained a higher degree of uncertainty due to the presence of multiple annotated alignments. we subsequently added whether the ucsc human spliced ests contained more than one alignment of the est to additional file 1: table s <dig>  in order to distinguish this category.

computational validation with pacbio rna-seq
the long-read pacbio rna-seq data from human embryonic stem cells  was annotated as transcript isoform predictions by au, k. et al.  <cit> . we downloaded h1-escs transcript isoform predictions in gtf format and converted the data to bed format. we applied the same intersections as described above for the est screen using bedtools. we characterized the filtered set of pacbio transcript isoforms for those also identified by the est screen that supported l <dig> asp transcripts.

annotation of ests that support l <dig> asp transcripts
additional information on tissue of origin, cell line of origin, and normal/cancer status were obtained by extracting and parsing associated information on ests downloaded from the batch entrez portal , which was then added to additional file 1: table s <dig>  the ests supporting putative l <dig> asp transcripts may be represented multiple times in additional file 1: table s <dig> because they overlap with more than one gene; however, further data analysis was only conducted on the unique set of ests identified. we manually inspected  <dig> of the identified ests using the ucsc genome browser and verified they all matched the above criteria for an l <dig> asp transcript in at least one location. the est sequences of all identified putative l <dig> asp transcripts were also downloaded in fasta format using the batch entrez portal. the sequences were examined for the presence of open reading frames  of at least 100 bp using the transdecoder module  of trinotate transcript annotation, which is a part of the trinity package  <cit> . we also required that predicted orfs start with a start codon encoding methionine to be considered a putative peptide. the genes associated with putative l <dig> asp transcripts were used for gene ontology analysis using the panther online statistical overrepresentation test  <cit>  and the panther go slim biological process . the raw p-values for the full results reported by panther were corrected using benjamini hochberg false discovery rate correction using the r statistical language  <cit> .

characterization of the l <dig> asp
we examined l <dig> asp transcripts in four categories: human-specific l1hs, primate-specific l1pa2- <dig>  ancient primate l1s, and ancient mammalian l1s. the est sequences were aligned to full-length consensus sequences of l1s in repbase and those reported by khan et al.  <cit>  using the last aligner   <cit> . for each est the position of the tss was computed as a percentage alignment position with respect to the full-length consensus. yy <dig> transcription factor-binding sites in the 5’ utr were identified by extracting the 5’ utr sequence from the l1hs consensus fasta. the online tool jaspar scan was used to identify yy <dig> binding sites corresponding to two pwm for yy <dig>  against the first one kb 5’ utr of the l1hs consensus using a relative score threshold of 90 %  <cit> . to create yy <dig> transcription factor profiles, cell lines in the encode project, for which yy <dig> chip-seq was performed, were selected . the yy <dig> chip-seq and input control reads were aligned to the l1hs consensus sequence using bowtie <dig>  which is ideal for short reads <100 bp  <cit> . the log2fc enrichment of yy <dig> was calculated per-base-pair of l1hs consensus using the read coverage per million mapping reads  of yy <dig> chip and input control, for which the normalizing factor, total number of mapping reads in the library, was determined by separate alignment to the human genome . the raw log2fc yy <dig> enrichment per-base-pair signal of l1hs consensus was smoothed by applying loess smoothing with parameter α =  <dig> .

to build tss profiles of l <dig> asp transcripts, we obtained the tss coordinate for l1pa2- <dig> and l1hs antisense est transcripts for plus-strand or minus-strand ests. we downloaded alignment files from the encode data repositories in bam format  for the k <dig>  h1-esc, and hela cell-lines and chip-seq data for the h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> histone marks and associated input controls. for k <dig> cells, we also downloaded alignments for yy <dig> chip-seq data and input controls. the average chip enrichment of est tss for plus- and minus-strand l <dig> asp transcripts was calculated using python package metaseq using a genomic window of +/−1000 bp tss and a 100 bp bin size to calculate depth  <cit> . the results for the plus and minus strands were merged, where −1000 bp represented upstream of the tss and +1000 bp downstream of the tss. the output of metaseq was the input-subtracted chip enrichment normalized as rpms. the gro-seq data were analyzed in a similar manner ; however, alignments to the human genome  were conducted using bwa-mem  <cit> . we used samtools to separate the positive-strand and minus-strand gro-seq reads and analyzed these reads against plus strand or minus strand est tsss using metaseq  <cit> . the results for the plus- and minus-strand gro-seq profiles were merged to obtain normalized rpm enrichment.

tissue specimens
for each specimen, we procured a single tissue fragment, measuring ~  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  cm, of selected grossly unremarkable organs. all tissues were stored at −80°c.

validation of selected chimeric l <dig> asp transcripts
we selected l1-uvrag and l1-kiaa1324l chimeric l <dig> asp transcripts for validation. using semi-quantitative rt-pcr, we amplified a region across the putative chimeric l <dig> asp transcript that spans the l <dig> promoter and nearby exon. half of the reaction  was resolved on a 2 % agarose gel to confirm the presence of a singular pcr product. the remainder of the reaction was cloned using a topo ta cloning kit according to the manufacturer’s specifications  and sequenced via sanger sequencing.

rna isolation and cdna synthesis
we originally yielded very small rna amounts  from fibrous organs, such as skin and muscle. therefore, we developed an in-house rna isolation method by modifying the protocol of an rnaeasy plus mini kit . first, a razor and forceps were used to finely mince one small tissue fragment, weighing up to 50 mg, on dry ice. the minced tissue fragments were suspended in 900 ml of pbs, to which 100 μl of collagenase/dispase solution  was added. the solution was incubated at 37 °c for 1 h. then, the lysate was centrifuged for three  minutes at full speed using a bench-top centrifuge. the pellet was collected and mixed with 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol and 1 ml of trizol reagent. the specimen on ice was homogenized using a hand-held homogenizer for  <dig> takes, each entailing continuous homogenization for 1 min followed by rest for 30 s. the specimen was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. proteinase-k was then added to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml  and incubated at 56 °c for 10 min  <cit> . the lysate was pipetted directly into a qiashredder spin column and centrifuged for 2 min at full speed. the supernatant was collected into a gdna eliminator spin column; the specimen was centrifuged for 30 s at  <dig>  x g, and the flow-through was saved. the rna precipitation was initiated by adding  <dig>  ml of chloroform to the supernatant, and the specimen was shaken vigorously for 30 s. the specimen was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at  <dig>  x g at 4 °c. the aqueous layer was separated, without touching the middle layer , and then mixed with 2 μl of pellet paint nf co-precipitant reagent.  <dig> volume  was mixed with ice-cold 70 % isopropanol into the specimen, and precipitate was allowed to form for 10 min at room temperature. the rna was pelleted by centrifugation at maximum speed for 15 min, after which the supernatant was removed carefully. the pellet was in 500 μl of 70 % ethanol, to remove as much of the overlying supernatant as possible, and then air dried at room temperature for approximately 5 min. finally, the pellet was suspended in 30–50 μl of rnase-free deionized water and the rna was quantified via a nanodrop  <dig> spectrophotometer . cdna were synthesized using poly-t primers according to the manufacturer’s specifications .

quantitative real-time pcr
we estimated the relative abundance of targeted rnas by resulting traditional cq  interval values in a steponeplus™ real-time pcr system . each experiment was performed in technical triplicates. actual pcr products were quantified with a faststart universal sybr green probe . the relative abundance of experimental rna—specifically, the arithmetic means of the cq values—was normalized to that of an internal control rna  to relative pcr efficiencies and pictorially represented as delta cq  means ± standard deviation. the pcr primers used in this report are in additional file 11: table s <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we identify  <dig> putative l <dig> antisense chimeric transcripts, the vast majority of which are novel. we independently verify some l <dig> antisense chimeric transcripts using both bioinformatics analysis and empirical evidence. interestingly, some l <dig> antisense chimeric transcripts are associated with evolutionarily ancient l <dig> subfamilies, suggesting exaptation of these evolutionarily-older l <dig> sequences. we conclude that l <dig> antisense promoters contribute to the transcription of up to 4% of all human genes and may potentially have wide-ranging effects in health and disease.
