BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells provide an important model system to study developmental regulation and hold significant potential for clinical therapeutics because of their unique capabilities to self re-new and differentiate into multiple lineages . the chromatin of pluripotent es cells have unique characteristics, including an open conformation, a hyper-dynamic organization of chromatin proteins, and less condensed heterochromatin domains, suggesting the plasticity of the genome in es cells .

different modifications of chromatin are associated with variable functions. histone modifications such as trimethylation of h <dig> lysine  <dig>  and hyperacetylation of histone h <dig> and h <dig> are known as active marks and are often associated with ongoing transcription 
 <cit> . on the other hand, methylation of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  are known as repressive marks and are associated with gene silencing 
 <cit> . promoters of key regulatory genes have unique chromatin modification signatures, which contain both an active histone mark, h3k4me <dig>  as well as a repressive histone mark, h3k27me <dig>  also known as bivalent promoters, and are thought to be poised for gene activation during differentiation 
 <cit> . distal regulatory regions, such as enhancers, are enriched in h3k4me <dig> , histone acetyl transferase  co activators  and have an open chromatin structure 
 <cit> . not only promoters, but enhancer regions were also shown to be poised for gene activation during differentiation as only active enhancers are marked by the h3k27ac modification 
 <cit> .

one of the most studied modifications of histones is acetylation of specific lysine  residues, which generally correlates with gene activation. the level of histone acetylation is regulated by the activity of both histone acetyl transferases  and histone deacetylases , which acetlylate and deacetylate lysine residues of the n terminal histone tails, respectively. genetic and biochemical studies suggested that hats have rather specific roles in gene activation, while genome-wide experiments rather suggested that hats are often recruited simultaneously, and together are acetylating multiple lysine residues at a given loci 
 <cit> . thus, the biological function of histone acetylation may be rather additive than specific. in es cells, acetylation of h3k <dig> was shown to predict the pluripotency and reprogramming capacity 
 <cit>  and its level reduces with es cell differentiation 
 <cit> . recent genome-wide studies shed light on various histone modifications in mes cells 
 <cit> , however, the genome-wide role of histone h <dig> acetylation in mes cells is poorly understood. in this study, we have investigated two histone acetylation marks, h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  acetylation of h3k <dig> is mainly performed by histone acetyl transferases gcn5/pcaf and/or tip <dig>  whereas acetylation of h3k <dig> is mediated by gcn5/pcaf, p300/cbp and/or myst <dig> 
 <cit> .

the lack of in-depth studies concerning the role of h3k14ac was due to the absence of reliable and specific antibodies. antibodies against modified histone tails are central research tools in studying chromatin biology at a genome-wide level. thus, we have developed a new specific chip-grade antibody against the h3k <dig> acetylation mark. by using the antibody we have developed against h3k14ac and another published commercial antibody against h3k9ac, we made genome-wide location analysis of these two acetylation marks in mouse  es cells, and compared the presence of two marks over various genomic regions. our study suggests that these two marks are present not only over promoters of actively transcribed genes, but also on the developmentally regulated bivalent promoters, as well as over active enhancers in mes cells. moreover, the degree of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation correlates with the cpg content of the promoters and transcription level of the genes. finally, we observed differential presence of these two acetylation marks over a subset of inactive genes, which is marked by low level of h3k14ac and thus seemed to be prepared for future activation.

RESULTS
genome-wide acetylation profiles of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> correlate with each other
to understand the role of histone h <dig> acetylation at positions k <dig> and k <dig> in mouse es cells, we have systematically tested the available antibodies raised against these modified histone tails. we and others have found that the anti-h3k9ac antibody from abcam  is specific for the corresponding modification in various applications including chromatin immunoprecipitation  
 <cit> . however, the anti-h3k14ac antibody from upstate , which was used earlier for genome-wide localization of h3k14ac 
 <cit> , was shown to cross-react with other histone modifications 
 <cit>  and was found non-applicable for chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled high throughput sequencing  
 <cit> . our elisa tests showed that it not only cross-reacts with with the h4k5ack12ac peptide, it also recognizes the non--acetylated h3k <dig> peptide . to overcome this limitation and to study the real genome-wide distribution of h3k14ac, we raised a specific mouse monoclonal antibody  against this modification and confirmed its specificity in several different tests .

to gain insight in the genome-wide acetylation profile of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> residues, chip-seq was performed using the commercially available antibody against h3k9ac and the new antibody developed against h3k14ac in this study. peaks of local enrichment for h3k9ac and h3k14ac were determined after sequence alignment and normalization to input dna. further to validate the peaks obtained in chip-seqs for h3k9ac  and h3k14ac , we performed chip-qpcr on randomly selected genomic loci enriched for h3k9ac and h3k14ac. all the selected peaks of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation from the chip-seq experiments were validated by chip-qpcr ), coding exons, introns and distal intergeneic regions , which represent  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total genome, respectively 
 <cit> . first, peaks of h3k9ac and h3k14ac local enrichment were determined after sequence alignment and normalization to input dna using macs 
 <cit> . our analyses show that h3k9ac and h3k14ac peaks are distributed over all four genomic regions and the frequency of distribution over promoters is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . however, approximately 85% of both the h3k9ac and h3k14ac marks are observed in distal intergenic and intronic regions with significant enrichments, comparable to promoters , suggesting that these two modifications may have a role at distal intergeneic and intronic regions. further to compare h3k <dig> and h3k14ac marks, a combined list of binding sites at transcription start sites  was established containing  <dig> tsss. the comparison of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over these tsss shows a pearson correlation coefficient of  <dig>  , suggesting that the studied two h <dig> acetylation marks are present simultaneously on promoters . moreover, h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations have a characteristic bimodal distribution around the tsss, with one peak upstream of the tss, another single peak  downstream of the tss, and depletion of the signal right on the tss . to examine the distribution of these two histone marks over the gene body, composite profile of both marks spanning the entire gene body and extending 5 kb upstream from tsss and 5 kb downstream of the 3’ end of the genes for combined list of binding sites over tsss  was generated . the h3k9ac and h3k14ac distribution profiles around tsss suggest that both marks are predominantly located in regions surrounding the tsss of genes. further to confirm that the co-occupancy of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> observed is not because of cellular heterogeneity, we performed sequential chip for h3k9ac followed by h3k14ac . sequential chip demonstrates that genomic loci are acetylated simultaneously both at h3k <dig> as well h3k <dig>  thus, our analyses suggest that on the genome h3k9ac and h3k14ac are mostly present at distal intergenic and intronic regions, specifically enriched at promoters when localized in the vicinity of genes and that the two acetylation marks co-occur at promoters as well as other locations.

levels of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations correlate with the magnitude of gene expression
global transcription is a hallmark of pluripotent es cells that contributes to plasticity and lineage specification 
 <cit> . histone modifications are known to act in a combinatorial fashion to determine the overall outcome of the gene expression 
 <cit> . to explore the correlative relationship between various active histone marks detected at promoters and the transcription of the corresponding genes in mes cells, we compared the level of various active histone marks with the transcriptional level of the genes. densities of active histone marks , as well as total h <dig> and rna polymerase ii , within a 3000 bp window flanking the tsss of the expressed genes  were collected. all expressed genes 
 <cit>  were divided into ten categories ranked on the basis of their expression level. presence of various active histone marks was analyzed over these categories. analysis of histone h <dig> occupancy, histone modifications  and pol ii around the tsss suggest that depletion of the total histone h <dig> signal and enrichment of the active promoter marks  at or around tsss correlate with the increase in gene expression levels. interestingly, h3k9ac is more spread than the other analyzed active histone marks around the tsss . while pol ii is enriched at or slightly downstream of the tsss, on these sites the nucleosomes  are depleted . this genome-wide observation with various active histone marks is consistent with the notion that h3k9ac and h3k4me <dig> near the tsss destabilize interaction between histones and dna leading to nucleosome eviction 
 <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that level of active histone marks  over the active promoter chromatin state correlates with the magnitude of gene expression. 

h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation levels correlate with the cpg content
cytosine-phosphate diester-guanine  islands are usually found at the 5’ end of the regulatory regions of genes 
 <cit> . cpg islands are gc rich, predominantly non-methylated and their content correlates with h3k4me <dig> chromatin modification. to explore the relationship between the cpg content and the levels of h3k9ac and h3k14ac, we took all the cpg island sites  from ucsc genome browser 
 <cit>  and sorted them according to their cpg content. on these cpg islands, which are sorted on the basis of their increasing cpg content, we looked for the h3k9ac and h3k14ac profile. we found that indeed cpg content correlates with the level of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation, as acetylation over those sites increases in parallel with the cpg content . this in turn suggests that the levels of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations on the nucleosomes positioning around the tsss of the promoters correlate with the cpg content of the underlying dna sequence. this is in accordance with the fact that cpg enriched genes are generally housekeeping and are widely expressed 
 <cit> . 

h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations occur at active enhancers
transcription from enhancers resulting in enhancer rnas  play important regulatory role in maintenance of gene expression programs 
 <cit> . enhancers are key cis-regulatory elements that can affect gene expression independent of their orientation or distance in a cell type specific manner 
 <cit> . enhancers are marked by the presence of h3k4me <dig>  dnase i hypersensitivity and histone acetyl transferases such as p <dig> 
 <cit>  or the gcn5/pcaf-containing atac complex 
 <cit> . the important proportion of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation sites in distal intergenic regions  motivated us to further analyze these sites for the presence of various histone modifications, pol ii and p <dig> that are indicative of enhancers. identification of h3k9ac and h3k14ac peaks in intergenic regions is described in materials and methods. during this analysis we found a strong correlation between h3k9ac or h3k14ac intergenic sites with either, h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac, the presence of pol ii and p <dig> suggesting that h3k9ac and h3k14ac mark also enhancers . to confirm the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over enhancers, we took  <dig> putative enhancers reported in mes cells 
 <cit>  and subjected them to k-means clustering using seqminer 
 <cit> . further, h3k27ac was used to distinguish active and inactive/poised enhancers. our analyses show that active enhancers are marked by the strong presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac along with h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig>  and those inactive/poised enhancers are marked by the presence of h3k4me <dig> together with relatively weak levels of h3k14ac . thus, our study suggests that h3k9ac and h3k14ac mark enhancers and can further discriminate active enhancers from poised/inactive enhancers. 

bivalent promoters are also marked by h3k <dig> and k <dig> acetylation in pluripotent mes cells
many promoters of developmentally regulated genes in mes cells are marked by h3k4me <dig>  as well as polycomb mediated repressive histone mark, h3k27me <dig> 
 <cit>  and are known as bivalent promoters. recent studies have shown that these bivalent promoters are also bound by pol ii and are transcribed at very low level 
 <cit> . as these promoters have h3k4me <dig> and show a very low level of active transcription we looked for the presence of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation over the bivalent promoters to see if this low level of transcription would also associated with acetylation on these promoters.

in order to test the presence of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations over the bivalent promoters, all the  <dig> mouse promoters from ucsc genome browser were taken 
 <cit>  and subjected to k-means clustering using seqminer 
 <cit> . h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  were used to get the bivalent loci. pol ii was included in the clustering to differentiate active and inactive genes. the resulting heatmap is shown in figure
5a. in agreement with previous genome-wide studies, there are three distinct categories of loci. in respect to the studied acetylation  active loci marked by pol ii, h3k4me <dig>  and devoid of strong h3k27me <dig> signals are highly enriched in h3k9ac and h3k14ac,  bivalent loci, which are marked by h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and low pol ii signals contain both h3k9ac and h3k14ac signals, and  inactive loci, on which either of the above signals is missing. our analysis suggests that indeed on bivalent promoters h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations occur together with h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> trimethylations . 
4: table s <dig>  error bars represent the standard deviation for three technical replicates.  ucsc genome browser track of two representative examples of loci showing h3k9ac and h3k14ac over the bivalent promoters.

to test the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over bivalent promoters, we took a subset of randomly selected loci and successfully validated them by chip-qpcr . further to test if h3k9ac and h3k14ac are functional at these bivalent loci, a hdac inhibitor and followed the level of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over time. first, oct <dig> levels were monitored by western blot to assess the pluripotent state of the es cells at various time points after sodium butyrate treatment. we found that oct <dig> levels are comparable in non-treated and sodium butyrate treated es cells at various time points , suggesting that the pluripotent state of the cells did not change during the treatment. next we analyzed two selected loci for the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac during the sodium butyrate treatment. we found that inhibition of hdacs by sodium butyrate leads to increase in h3k9ac and h3k14ac suggesting that these marks are indeed functionally deposited and are actively maintained . ucsc genome browser tracks of two representative examples on previously characterized bivalent promoters 
 <cit>  harboring the h3k9ac and h3k14ac over the promoters along with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> are shown in figure
5d and 
5e. thus, our genome-wide analyses show that h3k9ac and h3k14ac mark bivalent promoters along with active  and repressive  histone marks over developmentally regulated genes in undifferentiated es cells.

differential correlation of h3k14ac with repressive histone marks as compared to h3k9ac
we next analyzed co-localization of the h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation marks with various active and repressive histone modifications. the pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for these modifications in a window of 2 kb upstream and downstream the tsss of all the mouse refseq genes . heatmap of various histone modifications suggest that active histone marks have high correlation and are grouped together for efficient gene expression . surprisingly, we observed higher correlation of h3k14ac with various repressive marks, such as h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  when compared to h3k9ac . to further test the association of h3k14ac with inactive marks, h3k27me <dig> and h3k9me <dig>  we took  <dig> inactive genes, which lack pol ii and h3k4me <dig>  and calculated the ratio of h3k14ac/h3k9ac tag density. the ratio of h3k14ac/h3k9ac is significantly higher over inactive genes as compared to active genes suggesting that h3k14ac is specifically and significantly enriched at inactive genes . in figure
6b we used h3k4me <dig>  pol ii signals distinguish active tsss from inactive ones. to further strengthen our observations we took the  <dig> weakest  and the  <dig> highest expressed gene promoters, but this time based on their expression profiles as calculated from rna-seq data , and calculated the ratio of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation tag densities over the least expressed and highly expressed promoters. this analysis again shows that h3k14ac is specifically enriched at the weakest  promoters as compared to h3k9ac . this in turn suggests that h3k14ac, which is generally considered as a mark of active promoters along with other acetylation marks, can also mark inactive promoters, although to a lesser extent.

a subset of inactive genes is specifically enriched for h3k14ac
to understand the functionality of h3k14ac over inactive promoters, we examined the level of this histone mark over active and inactive genes in presence of sodium butyrate, a hdac inhibitor, and compared it to h3k9ac. in agreement with our above observations, we found that active genes exhibited a remarkable increase in h3k9ac and h3k14ac in presence of sodium butyrate . however, examination of h3k9ac and h3k14ac level at inactive genes in presence of sodium butyrate revealed a slow and selective increase in h3k14ac, while at these sites h3k9ac did not change . the selective increase in h3k14ac at inactive genes in presence of sodium butyrate suggests that inactive genes are subjected to constant h3k <dig> acetylation and deacetylation. this dynamic h3k14ac at inactive genes may poise them for future activation. to test this hypothesis, we selected  <dig> inactive genes having higher h3k14ac as compared to h3k9ac  and subjected them to gene ontology . our analysis suggests that inactive genes, which are having significant h3k14ac over h3k9ac belong to various pathways that are induced by various stimuli such as sensory perception, olfaction and chemosensory perception. other pathways include receptor activities, which are induced upon ligand binding to activate the signal transduction and ultimately cellular responses . thus, our data indicate that h3k14ac is selectively present over a subset of non-expressed genes and hdacs frequently remove this mark to keep the genes inactive. the coordinated action of hats and hdacs may poise these genes for stimuli dependent activation.

discussion
h3k9ac and h3k14ac co-occur with other “active” histone modifications establishing a chromatin conformation that is compatible with transcription
recent genome-wide studies have generated comprehensive chromatin landscapes for various transcription factors and histone modifications 
 <cit> . in our study, by using a new specific h3k14ac antibody, we show that h3k9ac and h3k14ac co-occur with other active histone modifications, h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac in mes cells. thus, it seems that at these sites all these “active” histone modifications are deposited by the corresponding activities sequentially, or at the same time, to act in a coordinated way. a possible mechanistic cross-talk between h3k4me <dig> and h <dig> acetylation could occur in the following steps:  histone lysine methyltransferases , set1/compass associates with the early initiating rna pol ii through the paf <dig> complex to methylated histone h3k <dig> around promoters 
 <cit> ;  various hat complexes  would then recognize this h3k4me <dig> indirectly or directly 
 <cit>  and acetylate the chromatin;  in parallel or subsequently other hats, such as gcn5/pcaf-containing saga and atac complexes, may recognize the h3k4me <dig> by the tudor domain of their sgf <dig> subunit 
 <cit> . this cross-talk between the h3k4me <dig> and h <dig> acetylation is supported by the observations indicating that knockdown of wdr <dig>  or set <dig>  of h3k <dig> methyltransferases complex not only decrease the h3k4me2/ <dig>  but they also decrease the acetylation levels at given promoters 
 <cit> . thus, h3k4me <dig> seems to provide a binding platform for hats, which are specific for the h <dig> tails, but may not be specific for the given lysine residue. this in turn would explain the fact that we see the acetylation of various h <dig> residues together  at the 5’ end of the genes, which follow the presence of h3k4me <dig> and the underlying cpg islands . this would suggest that some marks  are establishing more the openness of the chromatin, while others  may serve more as a docking site 
 <cit> . thus, all these marks together may be required to regulate pol ii transcription initiation positively.

the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac at promoters correlates with their cpg content
approximately 70% of all the annotated gene promoters are associated with a cpg islands 
 <cit> , which have distinct patterns of chromatin configuration. interestingly, in mes cells cxxc finger protein  <dig> , a component of setd <dig> histone methyltransferases complex has a preference for cpg clusters and can be recruited to artificial promoter-less cpg clusters that subsequently lead to trimethylation of h3k <dig>  a cpg island promoter signature 
 <cit> . the presence of h3k4me <dig> might be followed by a cascade of events and consequent acetylation of different h <dig> and/or h <dig> residues . acetylation  of the nucleosomes associated with the cpg islands might be acting as a physical barrier to inhibit the h3k9me <dig> of the chromatin 
 <cit> . housekeeping gene promoters have generally high cpg content and are often protected from dna methylation and methylation of h3k <dig>  enabling constitutive expression of the associated genes. thus, our findings which show a very good correlation between cpg content of promoter regions and acetylation of the associated nucleosomes on h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  along with h3k4me <dig> are in a good agreement with the model in which all these “active” histone marks influence the local chromatin structure to simplify the regulation of gene activity . our results also suggest the dependence of histone modifications such as h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k14ac on the dna sequences underneath.

h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation label active enhancers together with h3k <dig> acetylation
histone modification profiles have been used for identifying enhancer elements 
 <cit> . enhancers are characterized by high h3k4me1/h3k4me <dig> ratio, open chromatin, low pol ii and presence of hat co-activators such as p <dig> 
 <cit>  and atac 
 <cit> . interestingly, chromatin modification patterns at enhancers are much more variable and cell type specific, than chromatin patterns at promoters that are much more conserved 
 <cit> . our study establishes that h3k9ac and h3k14ac also mark enhancers. furthermore, like h3k27ac 
 <cit> , these two marks can differentiate between the active and inactive/poised enhancers . rna pol ii from these active enhancers produces bidirectional short  non-coding ernas, whose expression level correlate with the proximal gene activity. 
 <cit> . thus, along with h3k27ac, h3k9ac and h3k14ac can be used to discriminate the active enhancers from the inactive/poised enhancers at global and gene specific level.

genome-wide bivalent promoters are also marked by h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylation
here we also show that bivalent promoters are not only marked by the h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  but also by the other active histone marks, such as h3k9ac and h3k14ac. there are two possibilities for the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over the bivalent promoters. first, both acetylation marks may be required in addition to h3k4me <dig> for preparing these promoters of developmental genes for rapid induction at later stages. second, the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over bivalent promoters might act as a physical barrier and thereby inhibiting the trimethylation of h3k <dig>  which eventually can lead to a stable silencing of developmentally regulated genes 
 <cit> . thus acetylation of h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> may be required as a balancing mechanism to inhibit the permanent transcriptional silencing of the developmentally regulated genes 
 <cit> . our genome-wide study showing presence of h3k9ac at bivalent promoters is in accordance with earlier studies describing the presence of h3k9ac, along with the active  and repressive  chromatin marks, over bivalent promoters in undifferentiated es cells 
 <cit> . note however that hezroni et al. 
 <cit>  observed only very low h3k9ac levels over bivalent gene promoters in es cells. the difference observed between h3k9ac enrichment over bivalent promoters in our data and that of hezroni et al. 
 <cit>  could be attributed to the fact that our chip-seq data shows an increased depth in the coverage of h3k9ac sites compared to the one obtained previously. indeed, we obtained  <dig> million reads for our h3k9ac chip seq data versus  <dig> million reads in the former study. higher sequencing depth will result in a more complete coverage of the identified h3k9ac signals and also identify smaller peaks. thus, it is possible that we detect more peaks that would allow us a more thorough analysis. alternatively, differential enrichment of h3k9ac over bivalent promoters in our study and that of hezroni et al. 
 <cit>  is also possible because of the different antibodies used in the two studies, which can have distinct specificities.

a subset of inactive promoters are specifically enriched for h3k14ac
h3k9ac and h3k14ac are associated with active promoters and are considered as hallmarks of active transcription. however, we observed that in contrast to h3k9ac, h3k14ac is selectively and specifically associated with repressive marks such as h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> on a subset of inactive promoters. presence of h3k14ac on inactive promoters along with h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> is in agreement with previous observation where high throughput characterization of combinatorial histone marks using proteomic approach shows highest abundance for h3k14ac peptide with activation and repressive marks 
 <cit> . our data suggest that hats may bind transiently to a subset of inactive promoters and acetylated h3k <dig>  which is then removed by the transient binding of hdacs. inhibition of hdacs leads to substantial increase in h3k14ac of these inactive promoters, suggesting that these promoters are subjected to dynamic regulation by hats and hdacs. transient acetylation and deacetylation of these promoters may keep these promoters unexpressed but at the same time primed for future activation upon receiving the external stimuli. it is thus possible that the presence of h3k14ac over a subset of inactive promoters may serve as a landing platform for further hats, which have bromodomains, such as gcn5/pcaf, and propagate the acetylation of the given loci at a later stage. thus, presence of h3k14ac and the consequent coordinated action of hats and hdacs over these inactive genes might poise them for stimuli dependent future activation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we characterized the h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> acetylations over various genomic regions in mes cells. taken together our data suggest that genome-wide coordinated modifications of histone acetylation  and methylation  provide a general signature for facilitating gene expression over active promoters. on the other hand we showed differential enrichment of h3k14ac over inactive promoters. furthermore our analyses suggest correlation between acetylation of nucleosomes over the promoters and the underlying sequences and demonstrate the presence of h3k9ac and h3k14ac over enhancers, which can be used in the future studies to discriminate active enhancers from inactive/poised ones. in conclusion, our comprehensive study of h3k9ac and h3k14ac demonstrates a wider role for these to marks in gene regulation than originally thought.
