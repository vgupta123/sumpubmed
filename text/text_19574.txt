BACKGROUND
many genes in animal and plant genomes express more than one transcript by alternative splicing. these transcripts can encode proteins with different, sometimes even antagonistic functions. for example, many members of the human caspase gene family express alternative splice variants that encode pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins  <cit> . in mammals, most alternative splice events skip complete exons or utilize either alternative donor or acceptor splice site pairs. most of the latter  are in close proximity  <cit> , thus leading to the insertion/deletion  of only a few nucleotides. alternative splice events at nagnag acceptors are the most frequent of these events. previous studies suggest that the splicing mechanism of short-distance tandem sites involves stochastic selection of either site  <cit> . a subset of these events is under purifying selection, thus contributing to the repertoire of biologically relevant alternative splice events  <cit> .

in humans, a substantial number of alternative splice events either shift the protein reading frame or directly introduce a premature termination codon by skipping of exons or alternative usage of tandem splice sites  <cit> . most of these events render the transcript a target for nonsense-mediated mrna decay   <cit> . conservation of such events implies functionality, maybe by regulating the protein level  <cit> . on the other hand, many of these events likely have no functional relevance or may be due to splicing errors  <cit> . here, nmd is an important surveillance mechanism reducing the amount of transcripts that would be translated to truncated proteins  <cit> .

apart from nmd, cells can use the complex splicing regulatory mechanisms to silence deleterious splice events. for example, pseudo exons  are enriched in binding sites for silencing splicing factors, which prevent their inclusion into the mature transcript  <cit> . likewise, silencer motifs located between two alternative splice sites inhibit the use of one splice site  <cit> . thus, auxiliary splicing enhancer and silencer signals enable a high splicing fidelity, despite the occurrence of numerous pseudo splice sites. consequently, there seems to have been no need to get rid of all these pseudo splice sites in the course of evolution.

this situation is different for deleterious short-distance tandem splice sites that preserve the reading frame. firstly, they do not elicit nmd and secondly, mechanisms to inhibit the use of the alternative splice site seem to be limited. the latter reason is due to spatial restrictions that do not allow the placement of splicing silencer motifs between two splice sites separated by as few as  <dig> nucleotides .

furthermore, core components of the spliceosome are likely to be the major factors that enable such alternative splice events, whereas other splice events often depend on additional enhancing and/or silencing splicing factors. this makes tandem splice events rather independent of tissue-specific fluctuations in splicing factor concentrations. consistently, many tandem sites produce constant splice variant ratios  <cit> , although variation in the ratio was observed in several cases  <cit> . assuming that splicing regulatory mechanisms in general cannot completely inhibit alternative splicing at these sites, the ultimate option to get rid of a deleterious tandem splice event is to destroy the tandem site, for example by a mutation that destroys one gt/gc donor or one ag acceptor dinucleotide. under this assumption, we would expect to find traces of natural selection, evident as an underrepresentation of tandem splice sites at places where they are deleterious.

to test this hypothesis, we analyzed frame-preserving tandem splice sites with a distance of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nt . we focused on short-distance sites because a stochastic splicing mechanism is likely to be the basis for such alternative splice events  <cit> . we present multiple lines of evidence that such tandem sites are underrepresented in protein-coding sequences , and in particular in regions that form ordered 3d protein structures. we estimate that ~ <dig>  introns are under selection against possessing a tandem site.

RESULTS
underrepresentation of tandem splice sites in coding regions
we used human refseq transcript exon-intron structures and a series of stringent filtering steps  to create a data set of  <dig>  protein coding genes. each gene is represented by a single transcript. these genes contain  <dig>  introns that reside within the cds and  <dig>  introns in the 5' or 3' untranslated region . in the following, we analyze Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  and Δ <dig> tandem donor and acceptor sites, where the occurrence of alternative splicing could be inferred from mrna/est data.

we found that  <dig> % of the cds introns have a tandem donor  and  <dig> % a tandem acceptor . in contrast, utr introns, where such subtle events are expected to be neutral or only slightly deleterious, have a more than 2-fold higher fraction of tandem donors and acceptors . this suggests a general underrepresentation of tandem splice events in coding regions and is consistent with a report for nagnag sites  <cit> .

inhomogeneous distribution of tandem sites in ordered and disordered protein regions
next, we analyzed if this underrepresentation is homogeneous within the cds. we divided the proteins into regions that are predicted to have an intrinsically ordered or disordered 3d structure  <cit> . as shown in figure 1b, tandem acceptors are substantially underrepresented in ordered regions. tandem donors exhibit the same trend but the underrepresentation in ordered regions is moderate . this moderate underrepresentation might be due to differences in the frequency of polar and hydrophobic protein indels. the toleration of tandem donors in ordered regions might be higher, since they often insert hydrophobic residues , which are preferred in ordered regions  <cit> . we also analyzed how frequently tandem sites affect other characteristic protein features such as pfam domains, transmembrane  helices, signal peptides, low complexity regions, coiled coil regions, and nuclear localization signals , which is described in detail in the additional file  <dig> . we found that low complexity regions are rather tolerant for tandem splice events , which is consistent with observations for amino acid indels  <cit> . we also found evidence that tandem sites affecting tm helices, signal peptides, and nls are selected against the insertion of particular amino acids . tandem sites are also significantly associated with specific dna and rna binding pfam domains , consistent with reports for nagnag acceptors  <cit> .

selection against a strong minor splice site in ordered regions
using est counts as a rough measure for the frequency of splicing at the minor splice site, we considered a minor splice site as strong if more than 25% of the ests support the minor splice variant and otherwise as weak . for tandem donors, only 33% of the  <dig> events with a strong minor site affect ordered regions compared to 57% of the  <dig> events with a weak site . likewise, for tandem acceptors, only 22% of the  <dig> events with a strong minor site affect ordered regions compared to 36% of the  <dig>  events with a weak site . thus, ordered regions are under a strong selection against events that involve an efficient minor site.

location of tandem splice sites with respect to protein secondary structures
to further test the underrepresentation of tandem splice sites in ordered regions, we focused on pfam domains since these domains usually fold into a well-defined 3d structure. we obtained the protein secondary structure as well as the surface accessibility of residues from known 3d structures of pfam domains. we mapped the position of  <dig> and  <dig> introns with tandem donors and acceptors, respectively, as previously described  <cit> . for comparison, we mapped the position of  <dig>  introns without a Δ3/Δ6/Δ <dig> tandem donor or acceptor motif  since small in-frame splice site variations cannot occur in these introns. comparing the location of introns with respect to alpha-helices, beta-sheets, and non-regular elements, we found no difference between control introns and introns with tandem donors. however, introns with tandem acceptors are significantly biased against a location in helices and sheets . this tendency is even more pronounced for nagnag acceptors . as the exact boundaries of structural elements are sometimes difficult to determine, we further analyzed a broader context of ±  <dig> residue around the intron location. we considered an intron to be 'inside a structural element' if this broader context is completely inside a helix or inside a sheet. if the complete context is inside a non-regular element or in two different structural elements, the context is considered to be 'outside a structural element'. in this comparison, both tandem donors and acceptors show a noticeable avoidance of structural elements . the average surface accessibility scores are indistinguishable between control intron and tandem donor regions, while regions with tandem acceptors have a significantly higher surface accessibility . finally, we found polar residues to be slightly enriched in tandem donor and strongly enriched in tandem acceptor protein contexts , which is further evidence that protein variations caused by tandem acceptors are preferentially located on the surface of folded domains.

strong bias against plausible nagnag acceptors in human cds
to further investigate selection against tandem splice sites, we focused on nagnag acceptors for two reasons. first, these acceptors comprise the largest tandem class with a total of  <dig>  acceptors. secondly, the nagnag motif is highly predictive for alternative splicing  <cit> . that is, sites with the motif haghag  are preferentially alternatively spliced . in contrast, only a small fraction of the acceptors with a haggag, gaghag, or gaggag  motif allow alternative splicing . thus, we can use the motif to classify all nagnag acceptors into those that are likely and unlikely alternatively spliced, independent of available transcript data.

first, we compared the percentage of cds and utr introns that have a plausible or implausible nagnag acceptor. the frequency of plausible nagnag sites is  <dig> -fold lower in cds introns compared to utr introns . in contrast, the frequency of implausible sites is very similar in cds and utr introns. this shows a significant depletion of plausible sites in cds introns . consistently, aag and cag but not the synonymous codons aaa and caa have been found to be avoided at the 5' exon boundary  <cit> , although aag/cag is more often part of splicing enhancer motifs than aaa/caa  <cit> . furthermore, gag is not underrepresented at the 5' exon boundary compared to the synonymous gaa codon  <cit> .

to further test this, we considered nagnag sites in c. elegans, which is the only metazoan species found so far that lacks widespread alternative splicing at nagnag sites  <cit> . two points indicate that the simple classification plausible/implausible is also valid for c. elegans. first, c. elegans acceptor ags have exactly the same preference for the preceding nucleotide  as seen in mammals  <cit> . secondly, all of the  <dig> alternatively spliced nagnag acceptors in c. elegans are plausible  <cit> . thus, although the frequency of alternative splicing at nagnag sites is exceptionally low in c. elegans , those that are alternatively spliced have the same characteristics as in humans. thus, we can use c. elegans as another control for the underrepresentation of plausible nagnag acceptors in human cds introns. as expected, in c. elegans, we found that the frequency of plausible and implausible nagnag sites in utr and cds introns is very similar . interestingly, plausible nagnag acceptors are even more abundant than implausible ones both in utr and cds introns of c. elegans. this is presumably caused by a lower frequency for g at the 5' exon boundary in c. elegans  as opposed to humans   <cit> .

next, we analyzed the frequency of nagnag sites in ordered and disordered regions. the frequency of introns with plausible nagnag sites is  <dig> -fold lower in ordered compared to disordered regions. in contrast, the frequency of introns with implausible nagnag acceptors is only  <dig> -fold lower in ordered regions , which is a significant difference . the frequency of nagnag sites in the other protein features is shown in additional file  <dig> 

moreover, we analyzed the distribution of evolutionary 'young' and 'old' plausible/implausible nagnag acceptors in ordered/disordered regions. as shown in figure  <dig>  plausible nagnag sites that are human specific  or human-chimpanzee specific  have a significant tendency to avoid ordered regions compared to the respective implausible ones . a stronger underrepresentation was observed for evolutionary old  plausible nagnag acceptors . it is noteworthy that implausible nagnag acceptors resemble the expected distribution, which is the overall number of introns in ordered/disordered regions . thus, young and old plausible nagnag sites are underrepresented in ordered regions, indicating that selection against such sites is universal and more effective over large evolutionary distances.

selection against nagnag creating mutations
we have previously shown that a single nucleotide mutation can create an alternatively spliced nagnag acceptor  <cit> . we asked whether selection acts against single nucleotide substitutions creating plausible nagnag acceptors by comparing cds with utr as well as ordered with disordered regions. we considered only base exchanges that create a second ag dinucleotide in the context of a non-nagnag acceptor. to dissect selection against nagnag creations from other evolutionary pressures, we focused only on cases where the required mutation has to occur  within the exon and is synonymous  or  within the intron . controlling for different distributions in the required mutations and using implausible nagnag creations as a control , we estimated the relative risk  for the creation of an implausible vs. plausible nagnag acceptors using the cochran-mantel-haenszel  test. an rr of  <dig> indicates that the creation of plausible and implausible nagnag sites is equally likely, which is consistent with the absence of selection, while an rr >  <dig> indicates how much more likely the creation of an implausible site is. using the rr, we can estimate how many mutations that create plausible nagnag sites have been eliminated by selection.

first, we investigated the exonic creation of mouse nagnag sites inferred by comparing human acceptors with mouse and the outgroup dog. we found that the creation of an implausible nagnag site in the cds is  <dig> -fold more likely than the creation of a plausible nagnag, indicating that 62% of plausible nagnag creating mutations have been eliminated by selection . in contrast, the creation of plausible/implausible acceptor motifs is equally likely in utrs . in ordered regions, the rr of  <dig>   is substantially higher than the rr of  <dig>  in disordered regions . this provides evidence for a selection pressure against the creation of plausible nagnag sites in the cds, in particular against creations in ordered regions.

next, we investigated nagnag creation by intronic mutations. the rr is higher for the cds region compared to utrs . utrs also exhibit an rr >  <dig>  however the rr is estimated from sparse data and p =  <dig>  does not suggest a significant deviation from the expected rr of  <dig>  consistent with our above results, ordered regions exhibit a noticeable higher rr than disordered regions . in general, intronic mutations that create plausible nagnag sites seem to be under stronger selection than exonic synonymous ones . this might be explained by the fact that the upstream acceptor in a nagnag motif is generally the preferred splice site  <cit> . thus, the creation of a new ag upstream of an existing acceptor is expected to result in the usage of the novel acceptor in the majority of transcripts. in contrast, a novel acceptor downstream should be the minor splice site, consequently the established transcript is predominantly expressed.

since plausible nagnag sites in nematodes are rarely alternatively spliced  <cit> , we would expect a much weaker or no selection against the creation of plausible nagnag sites. to test this, we examined the creation of nagnag sites in c. remanei using the genomes of c. briggsae and the outgroup c. elegans. considering exonic synonymous mutations, cds introns have an rr very similar to utr introns . while the rr for nematode cds introns is significantly different from  <dig> , it is substantially lower than the rr for human cds introns. this is consistent with a much weaker selection against plausible nagnag creations in nematode cds. nearly identical results were observed for nagnag creation in c. briggsae . compared to mammals, c. elegans introns have an unusual acceptor site that lacks a branch point consensus but contains a highly conserved ttttcag acceptor motif, which is a high affinity binding site for the u2af heterodimer  <cit> . deviations from this consensus were shown to affect u2af binding  <cit> . consistent with this, we found not a single case among  <dig>  nematode introns where a nagnag is created by an intronic mutation.

discussion
we presented multiple lines of evidence that human coding sequences are under selection against in-frame tandem splice events. in particular, ordered regions are under strong selection, suggesting that even small changes  might affect protein folding and function. for example, the deletion of a few residues from the piccolo c2a domain leads to a structural change with marked consequences for ca2+ binding  <cit> . we also found that tandem acceptor caused protein variations in functional domains are preferentially located at the surface and outside structural elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. similar results were reported for protein indels  <cit>  and exon skipping events  <cit> . the frequent class of nagnag acceptors, which mostly result in the indel of only one amino acid  <cit> , is also under strong evolutionary constraints. consistently, a splicing-independent case study found phenotypic effects for two thirds of random triplet deletions  <cit> .

our findings of selection against tandem splice sites suggest that existing tandem sites are either  neutral or might have a functional role. alternative splicing frequently affects protein regions that are intrinsically disordered  <cit> . consistently, we found that tandem splice sites preferentially affect disordered regions. while alterations of disordered regions should not cause changes in protein structure in general, it can change the function of proteins  <cit> , as disordered regions are often associated with regulation and signalling  <cit> .

utrs contain secondary structures and binding sites for proteins and non-coding rnas that influence mrna export, localization, stability as well as translational efficiency  <cit> . thus, functional sites in utrs are also expected to be under selection. however, our results on tandem sites in utrs are consistent with neutral evolution, although individual introns can still be under selection against tandem sites.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that cds introns but not utr introns are under selection against tandem sites. thus, we can use the frequency of tandem sites in utrs to provide a rough estimation of the number of cds introns under selection against tandem splice sites. we found that  <dig> % of the utr and  <dig> % of the cds introns have a plausible nagnag . under neutrality, we would expect that the percentage for cds introns equals that for utr introns, consequently we estimate  <dig>   of the  <dig>  cds introns to be under selection against a plausible nagnag acceptor. likewise, we estimate that  <dig>  and  <dig>   cds introns are under selection against tandem donor and acceptor sites, respectively. in summary, we conclude that ~ <dig>  human introns are under selection against possessing a subtle tandem splice site inserting/deleting  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> nt.
