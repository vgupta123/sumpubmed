BACKGROUND
small rnas  involved in various gene silencing pathways play important and diverse roles in the development and differentiation of organisms through regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels  <cit> , affecting heterochromatin formation  <cit> , and responding to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in plants, srnas are generated from double-stranded rnas  through various pathways and may be classified into two major classes, including micrornas  and small interfering rnas , based on the source of dsrna  <cit> . mirnas are produced from plant transcripts with internal stem-loop structures, whereas sirnas are derived from transcripts with inverted-repeat sequence, dsrnas copied from single-stranded rna , over-lapping regions of bidirectional transcripts, or dsrnas formed by virus replication. the biogenesis pathways of plant srnas involve in various gene families, such as the dicer-like  family and the rna dependent rna polymerase  family, and each pathway appears to be taken part in by different member of a gene family  <cit> . to regulate gene expression, the generated srna duplexes from dsrnas are loaded into rna-induced silencing complexes  with argonautes  as the central components  <cit> . riscs remove the star strand  of srna duplex and select the functional strand as a guide to interact with homologous rna or dna molecules for direct rna cleavage, translational repression or dna methylation  <cit> .

agos are ribonucleases with two conserved domains, including paz and piwi  <cit> . the paz domain contains a specific binding pocket that can anchor srna duplexes with two-nucleotide 3′ overhang. the piwi domain exhibits endonuclease activity and the structure of piwi domain folded is similar to rnase h  <cit> . the endonuclease activity of piwi domain is performed by an active site usually carrying an asp–asp–his  or asp–asp–asp  motif. agos are usually encoded by a multiple gene family in organisms and the number of ago genes differs in different organisms  <cit> . fission yeast has only one ago gene, whereas insects, mammals and worms have five, eight, and twenty six ago genes, respectively. annotation of the arabidopsis and rice genomes revealed ten and eighteen ago genes, respectively  <cit> . additionally, a total of eighteen maize and fifteen tomato ago genes have been identified  <cit> . although a large number of ago genes have been found in various plants, the majority were predicted by computational approaches based on sequence similarity. only a small proportion of known agos were identified or confirmed by full-length cdna cloning. among them, arabidopsis ago <dig> is the most well-studied plant ago gene. it encodes the core component of riscs associated with the action of mirnas, trans-acting sirnas  and transgene-derived sirnas  <cit> . ago <dig> protein is involved in antiviral defense by catalyzing viral rna cleavage in arabidopsis plants  <cit> . arabidopsis ago <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> genes recruit endogenous 24nt srnas for dna methylation, which causes target gene silencing at the transcriptional level  <cit> . ago <dig> is involved in the generation of ta-sirnas from tas <dig> by collaborating with mir <dig> in arabidopsis <cit> . arabidopsis ago <dig> gene modulates shoot apical meristem maintenance and establishment of leaf polarity by repressing mir165/ <dig>  <cit> . in addition, although ago proteins are central components of riscs involved in srna-mediated rna cleavage, translational repression and dna methylation, some of them are regulated by srnas through the feedback mechanism. for instance, the expression level of atago <dig> is regulated by mir <dig> through direct cleavage of atago <dig> transcripts  <cit> . similarly, atago <dig> is regulated by mir <dig>  <cit> . the function and regulatory mechanism of ago genes from plant species other than arabidopsis is largely unknown.

s. miltiorrhiza, which produces two major groups of bioactive compounds, lipophilic diterpenoid tanshinones and hydrophilic phenolic acids, is a well-known traditional chinese medicine  widely used for treating various human diseases, such as dysmenorrhoea, amenorrhoea and cardiovascular disease, for thousands of years  <cit> . it is also an emerging model plant for tcm studies because of its relatively small genome size, short life cycle, undemanding growth requirements, and significant medicinal value  <cit> . the s. miltiorrhiza genome has been preliminarily decoded and a working draft of the genome is currently available . the interest of gene silencing pathways in s. miltiorrhiza is increasing. with the aim to elucidate the core components of gene silencing pathways, we performed a genome-wide prediction of the s. miltiorrhiza ago gene family. molecular cloning of ago genes was carried out for validation and error correction of computational prediction. the characteristics of s. miltiorrhiza agos were revealed by a comprehensive analysis, including comparison with agos from other plant species, gene expression profiling, and analysis of posttranscriptional regulation. the results provide useful information for further elucidation of gene silencing pathways in s. miltiorrhiza.

RESULTS
genome-wide prediction of s. miltiorrhiza ago genes
to predict s. miltiorrhiza ago genes at the genome level, we downloaded all of  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> rice ago amino acid sequences from genbank . blast analysis of arabidopsis and rice agos against the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome  was then performed using the tblastn algorithm  <cit> . an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig> was applied to the homologue recognition. as a result, a total of  <dig> genomic loci of smago genes were identified. the genomic dna sequence was retrieved and gene models of  <dig> smago genes were predicted using genscan   <cit> . the models were further examined and corrected manually by comparison with ago genes identified from other plant species using the blastx algorithm   <cit> . all of  <dig> deduced proteins share high sequence similarity with known plant agos and contain the conserved paz and piwi domains, suggesting they are authentic agos. the identified ago genes are named smago <dig> to smago <dig>  respectively, based on high sequence similarity with corresponding arabidopsis agos.

sequence feature, gene structure and conserved domain comparison of smagos and atagos
it is very important to know the correct cdna sequence for systematic characterization of agos in s. miltiorrhiza. in order to confirm the results from prediction and correct errors of computation, molecular cloning of full-length smago cdna was carried out. as a result, all of ten predicted smago genes were experimentally validated. analysis of sequence features showed that the length of open reading frames  of smagos varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>  bp  . the length of 5′ and 3′ utrs was between  <dig> and  <dig> bp and between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. the size of deduced smago proteins varied between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, the molecular weight  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda, and the theoretical pi was between  <dig> and  <dig> . these sequence features are quite similar to that of atagos in arabidopsis . the similarity between smagos and atagos was also observed in gene structures. many smagos genes have the number and phase of introns similar to an atago, such as smago1/atago <dig>  smago4/atago <dig>  smago7/atago <dig>  smago8/atago <dig>  and smago9/atago <dig> . additionally, both smago6/atago <dig> and smago9/atago <dig> have an intron in 3′ utr . the results suggest the conservation between smagos and atagos.

search s. miltiorrhiza ago proteins for conserved domains against the ncbi conserved domain database  revealed that all smagos contained duf <dig>  paz, and piwi domains , which were consistent with the results from other plant agos  <cit> . the function of duf <dig> is currently unknown; whereas paz has been shown to play roles in binding srna duplexes and piwi are important in cleavage of target rna  <cit> . the endonuclease activity of piwi domain is performed by an active site usually carrying a ddh or ddd motif  <cit> . additionally, a conserved histidine at position  <dig> of arabidopsis ago <dig> was found to be critical for in vitro endonuclease activity  <cit> . analysis of ten s. miltiorrhiza agos showed that half of them, namely smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig>  contained the conserved ddh/h <dig> or ddd/h <dig> residues; whereas the conserved residues were not observed in the other smagos . in smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig>  the third histidine was missing or replaced by leucine. smago <dig> and smago <dig> possessed the conserved ddh triad but histidine at 798th position was either replaced by alanine or proline .

phylogenetic analysis of ago proteins in s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis and rice
phylogenetic analysis using the paz and piwi domains for rice, arabidopsis, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, and mouse had previously revealed that animal agos clustered into two subgroups: a <dig> and a <dig>  whereas all plant agos could be divided into four subgroups: ago <dig>  zippy, ago <dig>  and mel <dig>  <cit> . the ago <dig> and mel <dig> subgroups had a common lineage with a <dig>  whereas plant zippy and ago <dig> subgroups and animal a <dig> subgroup could be diverged from an ancestral lineage  <cit> . in order to determine the evolutionary relationship of s. miltiorrhiza agos, full-length ago protein sequences from s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis and rice were aligned and an unrooted neighbor-joining tree was constructed. the results showed that ten smagos could also be divided into four subgroups . moreover, the clustering remained similar when only the paz and piwi protein domains were used for phylogenetic analysis . smago <dig> and smago <dig> are included in the ago <dig> subgroup with arabidopsis atago <dig> and atago <dig>  and rice osago1a-osago1d and ospnh <dig>  smago <dig> shares high similarity with atago <dig> associated with the action of mirnas, ta-sirnas and transgene-derived sirnas  <cit> , whereas smago <dig> is highly similar to atago <dig> modulating shoot apical meristem maintenance and establishment of leaf polarity  <cit> . smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> are members of the subgroup zippy. similarly, three arabidopsis agos, including antiviral defense-associated atago <dig>  function-unknown atago <dig> and atago <dig> involved in the generation of ta-sirnas from tas <dig> <cit> , are also included in this subgroup. smago <dig> shares greater similarity with atago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> are highly similar to atago <dig> and atago <dig>  the mel <dig> subgroup contains only one s. miltiorrhiza ago, smago <dig>  which is similar to the function-unknown arabidopsis atago <dig>  on the contrary, the ago <dig> subgroup is the biggest among four plant ago subgroups. it contains five s. miltiorrhiza agos, including smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> 

differential expression of smago genes
the expression of smago genes in flowers, leaves, stems and roots of 2-year-old, field nursery-grown s. miltiorrhiza was analyzed using quantitative rt-pcr technology. smubq <dig> was chosen as an endogenous control as previously described  <cit> . all of ten smagos were expressed in s. miltiorrhiza tissues analyzed, whereas differential expression patterns were observed . smago <dig> and smago <dig> clustered in the ago <dig> subgroup were expressed in flowers, leaves, stems and roots as their arabidopsis counterparts, atago <dig> and atago <dig>  respectively  <cit> . it is consistent with the ubiquitous roles of agos in the ago <dig> subgroup. although smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> were clustered in the zippy subgroup, their expression patterns were distinct . on the other hand, the expression patterns of smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> were quite similar to their arabidopsis counterparts, atago <dig>  atago <dig>  and atago <dig>  respectively  <cit> . by contrast, the expression pattern of smago <dig> was distinct with their arabidopsis and rice counterparts in the mel <dig> subgroup. smago <dig> showed the highest expression in roots, followed by stems, less in flowers and leaves. it is distinct with its counterparts, atago <dig> in arabidopsis and osmel <dig>  osago <dig>  osago <dig> and osago <dig> in rice, showing specifically expression in reproductive tissues   <cit> . similar to the smagos in the zippy subgroup, smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> clustered in the ago <dig> subgroup exhibited divergent expression patterns . smago <dig> was more flower-specific, an expression pattern similar with smago <dig> in the zippy subgroup; whereas, smago <dig> and smago <dig> were more root-specific. the results indicate the functional conservation and diversity of agos.

mirna-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of smago genes
to determine whether s. miltiorrhiza agos are regulated by mirnas, we performed a target search of plant mirnas in mirbase against ten full-length smago cdna sequences using psrnatarget  <cit> . the maximum expectation of  <dig>  was applied in the target search. a total of  <dig> mirna families were found to have perfect or near-perfect complementarity to smagos. it includes  <dig> mature mirnas and  <dig> likely mirna* . plant mirna sequences belonging to the  <dig> families were aligned with the current assembly of the s. miltiorrhiza genome using soap <dig> with two mismatches allowed  <cit> . genomic dna fragments surrounding these mirna sequences were used to predict the secondary structure using the mfold program  <cit> . a total of  <dig> hairpin structures were identified for six mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . manual examination of the complementarities between smagos and the identified s. miltiorrhiza mirnas/mirnas* and calculation of penalty scores as previously described  <cit>  showed that the scores for s. miltiorrhiza mir168:smago <dig>  mir403:smago <dig> and mir530:smago <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. however, the scores for mir167*:smago <dig>  mir169*:smago <dig>  mir396*:smago <dig> and were at least  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. high penalty scores for s. miltiorrhiza mirna*:smagos were due to low conservation among plant mirnas*. to verify whether these mirnas can mediate the cleavage of smago transcripts, we isolated rnas from roots and pooled samples containing flowers, leaves, stem and roots of s. miltiorrhiza and performed the modified 5′-rapid amplification of cdna ends  for smagos. the 5′-race products revealed that smago <dig> and smago <dig> are indeed the targets of s. miltiorrhiza mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively . mir <dig> targets to the duf <dig> domain  region of smago <dig>  while the target site of mir <dig> is within the 3′utr of smago <dig>  it is consistent with the results from arabidopsis <cit> , suggesting the conservation of mir168- and mir403-mediated regulation of agos between s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis. we also cloned 5′-race products with the 5′-end mapped to the mir169* complementary region of smago5; however, the positions are not between the  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides from the 5′-end of the mirna . no 5′-race products were obtained for smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> that were predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  respectively. in addition, mirna-specific qrt-pcr  <cit>  was performed to examine the expression patterns of s. miltiorrhiza mir <dig> and mir <dig> experimentally validated to target smago <dig> and smago <dig> for cleavage. the results showed that mir <dig> and mir <dig> were expressed in all tissues analyzed. the levels of mir <dig> in roots and flowers were about three times the levels in leaves and stems. the level of mir <dig> in flowers was more than twice the level in other tissues analyzed .

discussion
identification of ten full-length ago cdnas in s. miltiorrhiza
although argonautes play very important roles in small rna-mediated gene silencing and a large number of ago genes have been found in plants, many of them were identified through computational prediction based on sequence similarity. for example, often arabidopsis atagos, seven, including atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig>  have been experimentally tested, whereas the other three, including agago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig>  were predicted computationally . among nineteen rice osago genes, only six, including osago1a, osago1b, osago1c, osago1d, osago <dig> and ospnh <dig>  have been cloned . except for slago1- <dig>  slago1- <dig> and slago <dig>  twelve of fifteen tomato slago genes have not been experimentally confirmed  <cit> . in this study, we performed a genome-wide prediction of ten smagos using computational approaches, and then cloned the full-length cdnas of all predicted smagos. the number of identified s. miltiorrhiza ago genes is comparable with that in arabidopsis, although it is significantly less than the number in rice and maize, which are nineteen and eighteen, respectively  <cit> . it indicates that less duplication events are occurred for ago genes in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis as compared with rice and maize agos, most of which are evolved by duplication events  <cit> . the results provide very useful information for further elucidation of ago functions in s. miltiorrhiza and gene model prediction of agos in other plant species.

conservation and diversity of smagos and atagos
plant ago proteins share three highly conserved domains, including duf <dig>  paz, and piwi  <cit> . consistently, all smagos were found to contain these domains . paz functions in binding srna duplexes and piwi is involved in rna cleavage, whereas the function of duf <dig> remains to be elucidated  <cit> . the conserved ddh/h <dig> or ddd/h <dig> residues in piwi domain have been demonstrated to be critical for the endonuclease activity of ago proteins  <cit> . the conserved residues were also found in five of ten smagos . it includes smago <dig> and smago <dig> belonging to the ago <dig> subgroup and smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> included in the zippy subgroup. consistently, expression profiling of these smagos revealed similar patterns with their arabidopsis counterparts   <cit> . it indicates s. miltiorrhiza agos in the ago <dig> and zippy subgroup may play similar functions in the action of mirnas, ta-sirnas and transgene-derived sirnas and in antiviral defense as their counterparts in arabidopsis <cit> .

on the other hand, in the other five smagos, one or two of the conserved residues was missing or replaced by other residues. it includes smago <dig> belonging to the mel <dig> subgroup, and smago <dig>  smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> included in the ago <dig> subgroup. comparison of agos revealed that many arabidopsis and rice agos belonging to the mel <dig> and ago <dig> subgroups were also lack of the conserved ddh/h <dig> or ddd/h <dig> motif, such as arabidopsis atago <dig>  atago <dig>  atago <dig> and atago <dig>  rice osago4a, osago4b, osago <dig> and osago <dig> included in the ago <dig> subgroup, and rice osago <dig>  osago <dig>  osago <dig> and osago <dig> belonging to the mel <dig> subgroup  <cit> . the function of agos in the mel <dig> subgroup is currently unknown, whereas three of four arabidopsis agos included in the ago <dig> subgroups have been shown to recruit endogenous 24nt srnas for dna methylation  <cit> . it indicates that some of smagos in the mel <dig> and ago <dig> subgroups probably play a role in dna methylation instead of rna cleavage in s. miltiorrhiza. since the expression patterns of smagos in the mel <dig> and ago <dig> subgroups are distinct with their arabidopsis counterparts   <cit> , some smagos in these subgroups may play more species-specialized roles. further elucidation of these species-specialized roles will definitely add new insights into ago-associated gene silencing. in addition, absence of the conserved ddh/h <dig> or ddd/h <dig> motif was also found in some ago proteins from other plant species, such as maize and tomato  <cit> . it is possible that some of the ago proteins without the deeply conserved ddh/h <dig> or ddd/h <dig> motif are still capable of target rna cleavage. in this case, the unconserved residues in the motif may contribute to endonuclease activity. otherwise, they may be not a cleavage component if the deletion or replacement of conserved residues in the motif results in loss of endonuclease activity. further experimental analysis is necessary to clarify the hypothesis.

s. miltiorrhiza mirna identification and posttranscriptional regulation of smago genes
mirnas are a class of small endogenous non-coding rnas with size about  <dig> nucleotides. they are derived from primary mirnas  transcribed from mirna loci  <cit> . pri-mirnas have internal stem-loop structures that are cleaved by dcl <dig> to form mirna precursors, known as pre-mirnas. mirnas play vital roles in plant development and stress responses and have been identified from various plant species  <cit> ; however, there is no report for mirnas in s. miltiorrhiza, an emerging model medicinal plant. through a computational approach, we predicted  <dig> mirna genes in s. miltiorrhiza for the first time. they represent  <dig> mirna gene families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . using the modified 5′-race method, we confirmed that smago <dig> and smago <dig> were targeted by s. miltiorrhiza mir168a/b and mir <dig>  respectively . consistently, in arabidopsis, atago <dig> and atago <dig> were also regulated by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively  <cit> . it suggests the existence of conserved regulatory mechanism for some agos in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis.

it is generally considered that mirna expression is negatively correlated with that of targeted mrnas  <cit> . however, there are many exceptions. for instance, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed a positive correlation with their targets in rice  <cit> . comparing the expression of s. miltiorrhiza mirnas and their targets showed that no simple linear correlations existed between mir <dig> and smago <dig> and between mir <dig> and smago <dig> . it could be a consequence of the feedback regulation of mir168/ago <dig> and mir403/ago <dig>  <cit> . it is also possible that these mirnas and targets are regulated by other unidentified factors associated with a more complex regulation  <cit> .

although we cloned cdna fragments with the 5′-end mapped to the mir169* complementary region of smago <dig>  they were probably not the products of mir169*-directed cleavage. first, the penalty scores for mir169*:smago <dig> were at least  <dig> , suggesting low complementarity between mir169* and smago <dig>  second, the positions mapped were not located between the  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides from the 5′-end of mir169*, which was atypical for mirna-directed cleavage  <cit> .

s. miltiorrhiza mir167*, mir396* and mir <dig> were computationally predicted to target smago <dig>  smago <dig> and smago <dig> for cleavage, but no 5-race products were obtained for these smagos. it indicates that these mirnas are probably not involved in the regulation of smagos. however, we can not rule out the possibility that some of the mirnas regulate smago mrna levels in tissues unanalyzed or at specific developmental stages of s. miltiorrhiza or in cells undergoing certain environmental stresses. it is also possible that some of the mirnas interact with smago mrnas for translational repression. further analyzing the interaction between mirnas and smagos through genetic transformation may give us a clearer picture about the regulatory mechanism of smagos.

CONCLUSIONS
the decoding of s. miltiorrhiza genome allowed us to perform a genome-wide prediction of smago genes. the prediction was further confirmed by full-length cdna cloning, which resulted in identification of the first set of full-length ago cdnas in a plant species. through a comprehensive approach, combining sequence feature, gene structure and conserved domain comparison of smagos and atagos; phylogenetic analysis of ago proteins in s. miltiorrhiza, arabidopsis and rice; and expression of smago genes s. miltiorrhiza, we characterized the newly identified  <dig> smagos. the results suggest the conservation and diversity of sequence features and gene functions among agos from different plant species. analysis of posttranscriptional regulation of ago genes suggested the existence of conserved ago1-mir <dig> and ago2-mir <dig> regulatory modules in s. miltiorrhiza and arabidopsis. these results will help to open a window for understanding gene silencing networks in the well-known tcm plant, s. miltiorrhiza.
