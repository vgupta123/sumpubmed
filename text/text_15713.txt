BACKGROUND
the g protein-coupled receptor  superfamily comprises the largest class of cell membrane receptors found in metazoan proteomes  <cit> . in humans, more than  <dig> genes encoding different gpcrs have been identified and phylogenetically divided into five discrete families: glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/taste <dig>  and secretin   <cit> . adhesion gpcrs  are the second largest of the five gpcr families, with  <dig> and  <dig> members in humans and mice, respectively  <cit> . the agpcrs are further subdivided into nine groups based on phylogenetic analysis of the 7-transmembrane domain   <cit> . although members of this family follow the same general structural pattern as other gpcrs, they differ in that they are characterized by an extremely long n-terminus that contains the gpcr autoproteolysis-inducing  domain,  <cit>  which encompasses the highly conserved gpcr proteolytic site . most agpcrs undergo autoproteolysis at the gps motif, which results in a protein that is separated into an n-terminal fragment  and c-terminal fragment  that are thought to remain non-covalently attached at the cell surface  <cit> . the “adhesion” classification was given to this family of gpcrs due to the large number of classical cell adhesion domains found in the ntfs of many of these receptors  <cit> . in other proteins, these “adhesion” domains  are involved in protein-protein, cell-matrix, and cell-cell interactions, leading to the idea that they perform similar functions in agpcrs  <cit> . recent data for multiple agpcrs suggests that these proteins can function as adhesion molecules by virtue of the ntf, and as classical gpcrs that signal through g-proteins by virtue of the ctf, in addition to the roles the ntf and ctf have in concert with one another  <cit> .

in addition to their protein domain complexity, agpcrs have been difficult to study due to their large size and complex genomic structures, with many small exons separated by very large introns  <cit> . additionally, agpcrs have numerous splice isoforms, often lacking one or more protein domains in the ntf, which may have functional or regulatory roles  <cit> . the study of agpcrs is further complicated by the fact that this family is identified primarily based on structural similarity at the protein level because, on a sequence level, agpcrs can be extremely divergent from one another  <cit> . however, despite the divergence between family members, agpcrs in general are evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved, with a homolog found in social amoeba, dictyostelium discoideum  <cit> .

in recent years, the zebrafish  has become a premiere model organism for the study of a wide variety of physiological processes and disease states during development and in adult animals  <cit> . moreover, zebrafish have proven to be useful models to study agpcrs, especially in the context of development. for example, the functions of gpr <dig> in schwann cell myelination and inner ear morphogenesis were discovered in zebrafish  <cit> . zebrafish studies also demonstrated that multiple agpcrs - celsr1a  <cit> , celsr1b  <cit> , celsr <dig>  <cit> , and gpr <dig>  <cit>  - are critical modulators of planar cell polarity during vertebrate gastrulation. additionally, celsr <dig> is essential for normal development of visual circuitry in the zebrafish retina  <cit> . although advances have been made in understanding agpcr biology using zebrafish, the utility of this model has been impaired by the lack of a complete agpcr repertoire and gene expression profiles. to address this deficit, we mined the danio rerio genome to determine which agpcrs are encoded in the zebrafish genome. we also performed qpcr to characterize agpcr expression over a developmental time-course, as well as in a wide collection of adult tissues. our studies demonstrate that there are at least  <dig> agpcrs in zebrafish representing  <dig> of the  <dig> human agpcrs, with similar expression profiles as their mammalian homologs.

RESULTS
defining the zebrafish agpcr repertoire
to define the zebrafish agpcr repertoire, we first compiled a list of nucleotide and protein sequences for  <dig> agpcrs annotated in the zv <dig> release of the zebrafish genome using three genomic databases: genbank  <cit> , ensembl   <cit> , and the zebrafish model organism database   <cit> . next, we used genome alignment and search tools - blast  <cit> , ucsc genome browser  <cit> , and sequencher  - to further mine the zebrafish genome for additional predicted agpcr sequences. we conducted blast  <cit>  searches using both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of all of the  <dig> previously annotated zebrafish agpcrs, as well as agpcr sequences from five additional species: stickleback , mouse , rat , dog , and human . with this first pass of analysis, we obtained  <dig> putative agpcrs encoded in the zebrafish genome.

next, we took these  <dig> putative zebrafish agpcr sequences and blasted them a second time against the zebrafish genome . this step was essential for two reasons: 1) to determine if multiple predicted agpcr sequences could be consolidated because they actually represented the same gene, and 2) to search for more divergent paralogous sequences . indeed, further analysis of blast results suggested that several of the initial predicted agpcr sequences might belong to the same genes. for example, one predicted sequence encoded the n-terminal domains and another encoded the gain and 7tm domains. in these instances, rt-pcr using primers overlapping both sequences was used to determine if sequences were indeed part of the same transcripts . similarly, it was important to determine if any of the initial  <dig> putative agpcrs had paralogs because a whole genome duplication event occurred in the ray-finned fish lineage approximately  <dig> million years ago, which coincided with the radiation of teleost species  <cit> . moreover, several lineage-specific tandem duplication events have occurred in zebrafish following the whole genome duplication event  <cit> . therefore, many zebrafish genes are present in multiple copies. these searches resulted in a total of  <dig> predicted agpcrs.

upon the release of zv <dig>  we performed additional searches using our previously defined list of  <dig> agpcrs from zv <dig>  as well as the updated biomart feature in ensembl for all proteins with a gps motif and an agpcr-like 7tm domain. this second round of genome mining recovered an additional  <dig> agpcrs, most of which appear to be zebrafish-specific. our results indicate that there are at least  <dig> full-length agpcrs in the zebrafish genome. phylogenetic analysis suggests that they encode homologs for  <dig> of the  <dig> human agpcrs, and that nine human family members, emr <dig>  emr <dig>  emr <dig>  emr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  and gpr <dig> do not appear to have clearly defined homologs in zebrafish . consistent with the evolutionary history of zebrafish, we determined that  <dig> of the  <dig> zebrafish agpcrs that have human homologs are present in multiple copies. see additional file  <dig> for all accession numbers.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic analysis of zebrafish, mouse, and human agpcrs. the evolutionary history of the zebrafish agpcrs relative to their mammalian orthologs was inferred using the maximum likelihood  method based on the jtt matrix-based model using mega <dig>  the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig> replicates is shown as a representation of the possible evolutionary history of the 7tm domain of zebrafish , mouse  and human  agpcrs. the topology inferred from ml analysis was also supported by markov chain monte carlo  analysis, using the bayesian approach implemented in mrbayes version  <dig> . blue circles with solid red outlines were shown for the nodes that had more than 90% confidence support from ml bootstrap analysis and bayesian posterior probabilities . white circles with solid red outlines denote nodes that had 90% pp support but less than 90% bootstrap support. supports are only shown for nodes recovered by both ml and bayesian inference, with bpp >  <dig>  and bootstrap > 50%. zebrafish gene identifiers/names are highlighted in brown text. it must be noted here that the topology supported by ml and bayesian methods for group  <dig> and group viii slightly differ from each other, although both methods recovered the overall clusters of group  <dig> and group viii. the variations are that zflphn1b and zfgpr <dig> are placed basal to their respective groups in the ml tree, however, with a relatively low bootstrap support. nevertheless, the topology showing the homologous relationships of zflphn1b and zfgpr <dig> with their mammalian counterparts are supported by bayesian topology with pp > 90% .



here we present complete nomenclature for these zebrafish homologs based on phylogenetic analysis. the agpcrs we uncovered are referred to with gene names lower-case and italicized. any gene present in multiple copies is denoted as the gene name followed by a letter, such as “lphn1a” and “lphn1b”. for the predicted agpcr sequences that appear to be members of zebrafish-specific expansions that are not clear homologs of any human agpcrs, we named them based on the group that they cluster with phylogenetically followed by a number . however, we note that further analysis is necessary to be sure of the true identity of some of the predicted agpcr sequences. the phylogenetic analysis of the 7tm regions shows how the zebrafish agpcrs either cluster closely with their mouse and human orthologs or into distinct zebrafish-specific clades . separate phylogenetic analyses were performed on each cluster in order to determine nomenclature of the genes that had unstable positioning in the overall analysis . for example, zflphn1b and zfgpr <dig> do not clearly cluster with their mammalian homologs in the overall analysis, but when bayesian analysis was conducted on groups i and viii independently, these genes clearly cluster with their mammalian counterparts . importantly, the zebrafish agpcrs cluster into nine groups in the same manner as was previously described for human and mouse agpcrs  <cit> .

the domain architectures of zebrafish agpcrs  were predicted using the latest versions of conserved domain search service   <cit> , pfam search  <cit> , and the interproscan software package  <cit> . although the phylogenetic tree shown in figure  <dig> was built based on the protein sequence of the 7tm domains, most zebrafish agpcrs also share relevant protein domains found in the n-termini of their mammalian counterparts . this includes the zebrafish-specific agpcrs, as the predicted protein sequences share protein domains found in the n-termini of various members of their group, providing further support for the tree topology and nomenclature. for consistency, the domain architectures shown were made using the protein sequences in ensembl, as these have been manually annotated. however, it is important to note that in some cases, the predicted protein sequences in genbank are more complete, and may contain additional predicted domains that are not shown here, as they have not yet been confirmed. additionally, as for many zebrafish genes, the coding domain sequences  of zebrafish agpcrs are often incomplete. therefore, it is difficult to determine if the differences in domain architectures of zebrafish versus mammalian agpcrs are real differences or simply because the cds are incomplete at the 5’ end and thus the domains have not yet been annotated.figure  <dig> 
schematic drawing of domain organizations of agpcrs encoded in the zebrafish genome. agpcr domain architectures were predicted using cd-search, pfam, and interproscan prediction algorithms. each panel shows the long n-termini with multiple functional domains, seven integral transmembrane helices embedded in the membrane, and the intracellular c-terminal end for each zebrafish agpcr. for display purposes, the length of the n-termini of each panel does not correspond to a measured scale of amino acids; instead, the overall length of the receptors is shown in parentheses at the c-terminal end of each cartoon. the depicted domains are: seven-pass transmembrane domain , cadherin domain, calx-beta domain , cub domain , domain of unknown function  <dig> , epidermal growth factor , calcium-binding egf domain , gal_lectin, gpcr-proteolytic site , hormone receptor motif , immunoglobulin domains , immunoglobulin i-set domain , laminin egf domain , laminin_g_ <dig>  latrophilin c-terminal domain , leucine rich repeats , olfactomedin, pentraxin domain, sea domain, and thrombospondin type  <dig> domain .



importantly, the only other gpcr subgroup with a defined repertoire in zebrafish is the trace amine gpcr group. interestingly, trace amine gpcrs also underwent a large expansion relative to other vertebrates  <cit> , similar to the agpcr zebrafish-specific expansion we have described here. similarly, our data are consistent with global characteristics of the zebrafish genome relative to the human genome. for example,  <dig> % of all human genes have at least one ortholog in zebrafish, which is consistent with our finding that  <dig> % of human agpcrs have at least one zebrafish ortholog  <cit> . further, of the human genes that have zebrafish orthologs, 47% of those are in a one-to-one relationship  <cit> . this is also consistent with our finding that  <dig> % of the human agpcrs are in a one-to-one relationship with their zebrafish ortholog.

expression profiling of agpcrs in zebrafish
the expression profiles of agpcrs have been previously determined in a collection of adult tissues in mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , and human  <cit> ; however, to our knowledge, the expression of this family of gpcrs has never been extensively characterized throughout development, in any species. additionally, expression profiles of the agpcr repertoire in adult tissues are not resources currently available for the zebrafish research community. to address this, we defined the gene expression profiles of each of the zebrafish agpcrs using a combination of high-throughput qpcr   <cit>  and conventional qpcr . we chose  <dig> adult tissues to represent nearly every major organ system: brain, eye, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, skin, ovaries, and testes. we chose  <dig> developmental time-points to represent major milestones: 1 hour post-fertilization ,  <dig> hpf ,  <dig>  hpf ,  <dig> hpf ,  <dig> hpf ,  <dig> hpf , 3 days post-fertilization ,  <dig> dpf ,  <dig> dpf,  <dig> dpf,  <dig> dpf, and  <dig> dpf . qpcr data was analyzed using the ΔΔct method  <cit>  . to control for starting input amount, we normalized all ct values to a control gene, importin- <dig> , which showed stable expression in all time-points and tissues. we calculated fold change in expression relative to the  <dig> dpf time-point, as it represents a middle point between development and adulthood, where the fish has undergone all major developmental milestones and has acquired all tissues and organs, but is not yet a fully mature adult.

figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show fold change in expression for each of the  <dig> agpcr groups. tissues and/or time-points for which fold changes ≤  <dig> are described as “lowly expressed” or “not enriched”, fold changes between  <dig> –  <dig> are described as “slight enrichment”, and fold changes > 3-fold are described as “highly enriched”. it is important to emphasize that this method of analysis is meant to show enrichment over expression levels in the whole fish at  <dig> dpf, and does not depict raw expression. therefore, an agpcr might be expressed in and play an important role in certain cell types within a tissue even if that gene does not appear to be enriched in that tissue given these analyses. additionally, it is possible that some of the tissue-specific expression could be due to factors such as: residual blood, tissue-resident immune cells, or fat cells. for example, the thymus, kidney, and spleen are known to be the major lymphoid organs in adult teleosts  <cit> , so kidney analysis may represent expression in kidney tissue as well as in immune cells.figure  <dig>

importantly, nearly all of the zebrafish agpcrs display expression profiles similar to their rodent and human orthologs in adult tissues  <cit> , and our developmental data corroborates previous studies on individual family members in zebrafish  <cit> . we validated expression of all genes by performing rt-pcr on cdna samples obtained from a subset of developmental time-points and adult samples . we further validated qpcr results by comparisons to previously described whole-mount in situ hybridization  data for a subset of agpcrs  <cit> .

in zebrafish, early development proceeds in the absence of de novo zygotic transcription and relies upon maternal mrna contribution. zygotic transcription of some genes begins at approximately  <dig>  hpf , while for most other zygotic genes it begins after  <dig> hpf , as the maternal transcripts gradually become diluted  <cit> . previous reports on the zebrafish maternal transcriptome suggest that 34% of all protein-coding genes are expressed exclusively as maternal transcripts, 61% are expressed both maternally and zygotically, and 5% only undergo zygotic transcription  <cit> . in agreement with these data, 96% of agpcrs have at least some level of maternal expression, while only 4% of agpcrs appear to be exclusively zygotically expressed. interestingly, however, we did not observe any agpcrs that were only expressed maternally , suggesting that this class of receptors is important throughout additional stages of development.

zebrafish agpcrs – group i
group i agpcrs are composed of the latrophilins and eltd <dig> . the two paralogs of lphn <dig>  lphn1a and lphn1b, have nearly identical expression profiles with low expression during development until  <dig> dpf and specific enrichment in the adult brain and eye . in contrast to the other group i members, lphn2a and lphn2b are enriched earlier in development during gastrulation, with no significant enrichment in adult tissues . interestingly, the expression profile of lphn <dig> is remarkably similar to that of lphn1a and lphn1b, with the exception of slightly higher maternal and adult eye expression . eltd <dig> is expressed ubiquitously during development with slight enrichment maternally  and during gastrulation , but is highly enriched in the adult heart, liver, and muscle .

zebrafish agpcrs – group ii
group ii agpcrs are composed of cd <dig> and the emrs . with the exception of cd97b, which is slightly enriched during gastrulation and segmentation stages , the cd <dig> paralogs do not show enrichment during development. in contrast, all four cd <dig> paralogs are highly enriched in adult muscle, and to varying degrees in the intestine and liver . all cd <dig> paralogs except cd97d also show some enrichment in the kidney . finally, cd97a and cd97b are enriched in the adult heart , and cd97a and cd97c are enriched in testes .

whereas humans possess emr1- <dig> and mice have homologs of emr <dig> and emr <dig>  zebrafish possess at least  <dig> emr-like proteins . although genbank defines some of these predicted zebrafish emr-like genes into “emr1-like” or “emr3-like”, we did not find sufficient evidence to suggest that the zebrafish emr-like sequences were more similar to any of the four human emrs. however, these sequences did cluster with group ii, but distinctly from the cd <dig> clade . therefore, we named these genes emr-like followed by a number .

interestingly, although the zebrafish emr-like proteins phylogenetically cluster together in a zebrafish-specific expansion of group ii , and not clearly with the human and mouse orthologs of emr1- <dig>  the zebrafish gene expression profiles in adult tissues resemble those of human emr1- <dig>  <cit>  and mouse emr <dig> and emr <dig>  <cit> . it is important to note that two of the zebrafish emr-like genes, emrl <dig> and emrl <dig>  are so similar at the nucleotide level that they could not be distinguished by unique primers that were compatible with qpcr assays. therefore, primers were designed that could amplify emrl <dig> and emrl <dig> distinctly from the other  <dig> zebrafish emr-like genes, and the expression of emrl1/emrl <dig> is shown on the same graph . interestingly, all but four of the zebrafish emr-like genes  are lowly expressed during early development, and only begin to show very slight enrichment between  <dig> dpf and  <dig> dpf. additionally, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> emr-like genes show enrichment in the adult liver  and in the testes . in terms of specific enrichment, emrl <dig> and/or emrl <dig> are enriched in the brain , emrl <dig>  emrl <dig>  and emrl <dig> are also highly enriched in skeletal muscle , and emrl <dig> is slightly enriched in the skin . emrl <dig> and emrl <dig> are very lowly expressed, showing no enrichment over  <dig> dpf at any stage of development or in any adult tissue . interestingly, emrl <dig> is the only emr-like gene that is highly enriched during maternal transcription and in adult ovaries, in addition to its enrichment in the liver, muscle, and testes . finally, emrl <dig> and emrl <dig> have broader expression profiles than their fellow emr-like genes, with varying degrees of enrichment in the adult heart, intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, skin, and testes .

zebrafish agpcrs – group iii
group iii agpcrs are composed of gpr <dig>  gpr123l, gpr <dig>  and gpr <dig> . interestingly, gpr <dig> and gpr123l are differentially expressed both during development as well as in adult tissues. both genes are slightly enriched at all developmental stages after  <dig> dpf, except at  <dig> dpf, as well as in the adult brain and eye . however, gpr <dig> is also enriched during maternal and early gastrulation stages  and in the adult liver, muscle, and ovaries . gpr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed at very low levels during early development with slightly higher expression after  <dig> dpf and a slight enrichment in the adult heart . developmental expression data for gpr <dig> are consistent with previous reports in zebrafish, which show that it is highly enriched during early development  <cit>  and then ubiquitously expressed at very low levels at later larval stages and in adult tissues .

zebrafish agpcrs – group iv
group iv agpcrs are composed of the celsr proteins . consistent with previous studies in zebrafish  <cit> , we found that all group iv agpcrs except celsr <dig> are highly expressed during gastrulation and segmentation stages and then expressed at lower levels during later development and in adult tissues . in contrast, celsr <dig> is lowly expressed until  <dig> dpf, and then highly enriched in the brain, eye, and skeletal muscle in adults .

zebrafish agpcrs – group v
group v agpcrs are composed of gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> . gpr <dig> is expressed ubiquitously at low levels both during development and in adult tissues, with the exception of slight enrichment in the adult eye and heart . in contrast, gpr <dig> is slightly maternally enriched and highly enriched beginning at segmentation stages . gpr <dig> is also slightly enriched in the adult brain and skeletal muscle and highly enriched in adult testes .

zebrafish agpcrs – group vi
group vi agpcrs are composed of gpr113a, gpr113b, and five group vi-like genes  that appear to be zebrafish specific . we note that the sequences for g6l1- <dig> are labeled as “predicted gpr110-like” or “predicted gpr116-like” in genbank; however, there was not sufficient evidence based on sequence similarities, protein structure, or phylogenetics to confidently call these genes homologs of mammalian gpr <dig> and gpr <dig>  with the exception of gpr113b, and a very slight enrichment of g6l <dig> at  <dig> hpf, group vi agpcrs are expressed at low levels during early development. gpr113a is lowly expressed at all stages of development, but is enriched in the adult liver, skin, and testes . gpr113b is highly expressed maternally and during early gastrulation; additionally, gpr113b is enriched in the adult kidney, liver, ovaries, and testes . g6l <dig> and g6l <dig> are slightly enriched after  <dig> dpf and in the adult skin . g6l <dig> is slightly enriched after  <dig> dpf and in the adult intestine, kidney, and muscle, and is highly enriched in skin and testes . g6l <dig> is expressed very lowly during development; however, it is highly and specifically enriched in the adult skin . g6l <dig> is not significantly enriched at any stage of development, but is highly enriched in the adult liver .

zebrafish agpcrs – group vii
group vii agpcrs are composed of the bais . expression analysis of group vii agpcrs is consistent with previous reports in zebrafish  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> , with significant enrichment in the brain for all members . additionally, with the exception of bai <dig>  all of the group vii agpcrs do not show enrichment during development until  <dig> dpf. interestingly, bai <dig> also shows slightly enriched maternal expression, and is the only group member to show higher enrichment in the adult eye than in the adult brain .

zebrafish agpcrs – group viii
group viii agpcrs are composed of gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr64a, gpr64b, gpr112a, gpr112b, and gpr <dig>  as well as five zebrafish-specific group viii-like genes  . with the exception of gpr <dig>  gpr64b, and g8l <dig>  group viii agpcrs are lowly expressed during early development, and do not show significant enrichment until 3– <dig> dpf. in contrast, gpr <dig> is highly enriched at segmentation stages . gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr112a, gpr112b, and g8l <dig> are all enriched in the adult intestine , consistent with observations in the rat gastrointestinal tract for gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  and gpr <dig>  <cit> . additionally, gpr <dig> is enriched in the adult heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and skin . both paralogs of gpr <dig> are enriched in the skin , but interestingly, gpr64a is also highly enriched in the eye . similarly, while both paralogs of gpr <dig> are highly and specifically enriched in the adult intestine , gpr112b is also enriched in the liver and testes . in adult tissues, gpr <dig> is slightly enriched in the kidney and highly enriched in skeletal muscle .

the genes that make up the zebrafish-specific expansion of group viii show broadly similar expression profiles to other group viii members, with low expression during development and specific enrichment in a few adult tissues . g8l <dig>  g8l <dig>  and g8l <dig> are all specifically enriched in the adult liver . g8l <dig> and g8l <dig> are slightly enriched after  <dig> dpf, as well as in the adult intestine, kidney, and skin . additionally, g8l <dig> is slightly enriched in skeletal muscle and highly enriched in testes , while g8l <dig> is also enriched in the adult eye .

zebrafish agpcrs – group ix
the final group of agpcrs consists of gpr <dig>  gpr128a, and gpr128b . however, it should be noted that these genes do not phylogenetically cluster together into a clade, but considered together here because they do not cluster distinctly with any of the other eight groups . interestingly, gpr128a and gpr128b are both expressed very lowly during early development, but are differentially enriched specifically in the adult liver and kidney, respectively . gpr <dig> is highly enriched during late gastrulation stages as well as in the adult eye . these results are consistent with a role of gpr <dig> in retinal disease and usher syndrome in humans  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here we have shown that there are at least  <dig> agpcrs in the zebrafish genome that represent homologs of  <dig> of the  <dig> agpcrs found in humans. phylogenetic analysis of the 7tm suggests that the zebrafish agpcrs cluster closely with their mammalian homologs and separate into the same nine groups as previously described for the human agpcr repertoire  <cit> . in adult tissues, zebrafish agpcr expression profiles are quite similar to those previously described for agpcrs in rodents  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . this study provides the first quantitative description of the expression profiles of this gene family over an extensive developmental time-course. importantly, our data also agrees with previously reported wish data for a subset of agpcrs at a few different developmental stages  <cit> . a summary of agpcr peak enrichments during zebrafish development is shown in figure  <dig>  interestingly, none of the zebrafish agpcrs were most highly enriched at  <dig> hpf , when zygotic transcription is beginning; however, whether or not there is any functional significance to this observation is unknown.figure  <dig>

our data suggests it is likely that agpcrs play important roles in fish as at least  <dig> members are found in a single teleost species, compared with  <dig> members in humans and  <dig> in mouse and rat. the majority of these proteins are classified as “orphan” receptors meaning the ligand is unknown, and for most family members, precise biological functions remain mysterious. despite our incomplete understanding of agpcrs, they have been implicated in many crucial physiological processes, both during early development as well as in adult tissues, including but not limited to the role of celsr proteins  <cit>  and gpr <dig>  <cit>  in gastrulation, celsr1- <dig> in the migration of facial branchiomotor neurons during hindbrain development  <cit> , gpr <dig> in the development of the ear  <cit>  and schwann cells  <cit> , gpr <dig> in regulating cns angiogenesis  <cit> , cd <dig> in leukocyte trafficking and adaptive t-cells responses  <cit> , emr <dig> in the production of cd8+ cells  <cit> , gpr <dig> in male infertility  <cit> , and bai1- <dig> in inhibiting angiogenesis in the brain  <cit> .

the importance of agpcrs in human health is further underscored in diseases in which they are disrupted, such as bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria   <cit> , usher syndrome   <cit> , glioblastomas   <cit> , susceptibility to brain arteriovenous malformation   <cit> , and breast cancer metastasis   <cit> .

our data likely represent the majority of zebrafish agpcrs, although it is difficult to be sure that we have identified every agpcr in the zebrafish repertoire for several reasons. first, zebrafish possess  <dig>  protein-coding genes, more than any previously sequenced vertebrate species  <cit> , and yet the zebrafish genome is not as well sequenced or as well annotated as the human and mouse genomes. the release of zv <dig> significantly improved the quality of the zebrafish reference sequence and demonstrated that the zebrafish genome has an overall repeat content of  <dig> %, the highest reported in any vertebrate species to date  <cit> . however, the highly repetitive nature of the zebrafish genome makes correct annotation of different gene duplicates without manual curation challenging. additionally, we only included full-length agpcr sequences that have the appropriate hallmark agpcr domains  in this study. notably, we also identified several partial putative agpcr sequences that appear to only contain some of the domains found in the n-termini of these proteins . further analysis will be necessary to determine if these sequences are pseudogenes, actually belong to one of the full-length sequences , or if their remaining domains have not yet been found and annotated. it is also important to note that our approach of using whole animals for developmental time-points and whole adult organs has limited sensitivity and might not reveal instances in which an agpcr functions, or is expressed, in very specific and/or scarce cell types. for example, gpr <dig> is expressed in bergmann glia of the cerebellum in mouse  <cit> , but in zebrafish, gpr <dig> is not enriched in whole brain. additionally, several agpcrs are known to be highly expressed and to play critical roles in immune cells; however, the relative abundance of resident immune cells in different tissues is unknown in zebrafish. therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the expression signal of any tissue might be in part due to resident immune cells or immune cells from residual blood in or on the tissue at the time of sample processing. future work, including cell type-specific expression analyses, global and cell-specific mutant studies, and additional curation of the zebrafish reference genome can address these limitations.

in sum, agpcr biology is a highly active field of research that is also attractive for its potential implications in human health. approximately 30% of newly introduced drugs target gpcrs  <cit> , suggesting that agpcrs may represent potentially novel therapeutic targets for a wide variety of human pathologies. zebrafish are genetically tractable vertebrates that can rapidly produce large numbers of progeny that are transparent during early development. this allows for straightforward genetic manipulation and the use of live animal imaging techniques for phenotypic analysis. the recent advent of talen  <cit>  and crispr-cas  <cit>  technologies has also made genome editing very fast and efficient in zebrafish. additionally, zebrafish are highly amenable to drug screens, and have already proven to be a useful model for the study of agpcr biology. therefore, the provision of the zebrafish agpcr repertoire and their expression profiles herein should allow for significant advancement of agpcr research in the zebrafish community which will eventually result not only in our further understanding of this unique gpcr family, but may also lay the foundation for future work to modulate these proteins in human disease.
