BACKGROUND
burkholderia thailandensis is a less virulent close relative of burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis  <cit> . b. thailandensis can be differentiated biochemically from b. pseudomallei by its ability to assimilate arabinose  <cit> . during the course of environmental surveys for b. pseudomallei in the rural region outside darwin, northern territory, australia, an arabinose assimilating isolate, designated strain msmb  <dig>  was recovered from a bore water source that also yielded b. pseudomallei from the same and subsequent samples.

we report the initial characterization of a b. thailandensis-like isolate, the first of its kind, in australia. in this study we characterize strain msmb  <dig> using phenotypic tests, 16s rdna gene sequencing, multi-locus sequence typing , and dna-dna hybridization.

RESULTS
standard biochemical testing, including arabinose assimilation, identified strain msmb  <dig> as b. thailandensis. however, msmb  <dig> did not grow at 42°c and produced little to no gas from nitrate  <cit> . a b. pseudomallei-specific real-time pcr method targeting a gene in the type iii secretion system  was performed as previously described. strain msmb  <dig> was negative by tts real-time pcr suggesting that it was not a b. pseudomallei  <cit> .

the accession numbers for the 16s rdna sequences determined for strains msmb  <dig> and burkholderia thailandensis atcc 700388t are  and  respectively. the 16s rdna sequence of strain msmb  <dig> has  <dig> % similarity and  <dig> % identity to the 16s rdna sequence of the b. thailandensis type strain. the discrepancy between the % similarity and % identity is due to multiple heterogeneous base calls in the sequence for msmb  <dig>  probably resulting from differences in alleles of the 16s rdna, which has been previously noted for b. pseudomallei, but not in b. thailandensis  <cit> .

to characterize msmb  <dig> further, we performed multi-locus sequence typing , which uses the dna sequencing of defined segments of seven housekeeping genes to determine strain relatedness  <cit> . strain msmb  <dig> was assigned a sequence type  of  <dig> on the mlst website. none of the alleles for strain msmb  <dig> matched alleles of b. thailandensis strains available in the mlst database  <cit> . a dendrogram using concatenated sequences of all b. thailandensis sts in the database, along with a representative set of b. pseudomallei and b. oklahomensis sequences, indicates that st  <dig> of strain msmb  <dig> does not cluster with any sts except for st <dig> . st <dig> is represented by only one example, strain  <dig>  which is an unassigned burkholderia species from a water sample from another bore in the rural darwin region that had also yielded b. pseudomallei isolates. msmb  <dig> and strain  <dig> share one allele, nark, by mlst. comparing the concatenated sequences directly indicates that the sequence for st  <dig> has an identity of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, to the sequences of the type strains of b. thailandensis,  b. pseudomallei, and b. oklahomensis.

to determine the relatedness of strain msmb  <dig> to the b. thailandensis type strain at the whole genome level dna-dna hybridization was performed as previously described  <cit> . a 91% level of relatedness was determined when dna from strain msmb  <dig> was labeled and in the reciprocal test using labeled dna from the b. thailandensis type strain .

arelative binding ratio: the amount of double-stranded dna formed between labeled and unlabeled dnas from different strains divided by the amount of double-stranded dna formed between labeled and unlabeled dna from the same strain. rbr is expressed as a percentage.

bdivergence within related sequences calculated on the assumption that each 1°c decrease in the thermal stability of a dna duplex is caused by 1% of unpaired bases within that duplex. d was calculated to the nearest  <dig> %.

burkholderia pseudomallei is a major cause of community acquired septicemia in thailand and in tropical northern australia, especially the darwin region of the northern territory  <cit> . as an environmental saprophyte, it has a wide distribution in endemic areas and poses a hazard for those who are exposed to it. in northern australia, the ability to distinguish the pathogen b. pseudomallei from less or non-pathogenic species is important since public health action may result  <cit> . for instance, the misidentification in the u.s. of b. thailandensis as b. pseudomallei could potentially trigger an unnecessary bioterrorism investigation.

strain msmb  <dig> appears distinct from b. thailandensis, b. pseudomallei, and b. oklahomensis by analysis of mlst sequences, but unexpectedly the percent dna-dna hybridization is above the 70% threshold that fulfills part of the current gold standard for species definition  <cit> .

b. thailandensis is a close relative of b. pseudomallei, but is much less virulent in animal models such as hamsters  <cit> . since access to b. pseudomallei is restricted due to its classification as a category b select agent, b. thailandensis and other less virulent related strains may serve as acceptable substitutes for training and research  <cit> . b. thailandensis has also been the subject of increased investigation recently, especially in genome sequence comparison studies, to reveal virulence factors in b. pseudomallei  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we report the isolation and characterization of strain msmb  <dig> from bore water in the rural darwin region of tropical northern australia. this is the first report of a b. thailandensis-like isolate in australia. further genomic characterization of msmb  <dig> may yield insights into the phylogenetic relatedness of b. thailandensis strains and may allow identification of yet undescribed virulence factors in b. pseudomallei. the relationship of this isolate to b. thailandensis strains from southeast asia and to endemic australian burkholderia species requires further elucidation. the genome of msmb  <dig> is currently being fully sequenced along with a collection of b. pseudomallei, b. mallei and b. thailandensis strains from various locations  <cit> . the sequencing project should help unravel the phylogeny of these burkholderia and ascertain if msmb  <dig> represents environmental burkholderia species in australia which are ancestral to both southeast asian b. thailandensis and b. pseudomallei. recent data show that australian b. pseudomallei strains are probably ancestral to those from southeast asia  <cit> . the origins of b. pseudomallei may therefore be linked to environmental burkholderia species in australia such as msmb  <dig>  in addition, comparison of b. pseudomallei and closely related burkholderia strains collected concurrently from environmental sources may provide further insights into horizontal gene transfer among these species  <cit> .
