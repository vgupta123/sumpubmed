BACKGROUND
angiogenesis is the process of formation of capillaries that sprout from existing blood vessels. it plays an essential role in several physiological processes such as wound healing, female reproduction, embryonic development, organ formation, and tissue regeneration and remodeling  <cit> . in pathological processes, the abnormal growth of new blood vessels can lead to the progression of many diseases including tumor growth.

angiostatin is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor specific for endothelial cells. it is a single chain proteolytic fragment consisting of the first four triple disulfide-linked kringle domains of plasminogen  <cit> . functional angiostatin-like molecules can be generated from plasmin reduction and proteolysis  <cit> , plasminogen digestion by pancreas elastase  <cit> , urokinase-activated plasmin  <cit> , prostate specific antigen  <cit> , cathepsin d  <cit> , and by several matrix metalloproteinases, including mmp- <dig>  <cit> , matrilysin or mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  <cit> , and mmp- <dig>  <cit> .

matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  was originally isolated from the inflamed synovium of a rheumatoid arthritis patient  <cit> , from mammary gland, and liver  <cit> . human and murine orthologues of mmp- <dig>  retain the common domain organization of soluble members of the mmp family, however, they also contain several distinctive features including a unique cysteine in the catalytic domain, an altered latency motif, a unique oligoglutamate insertion in the hinge region, and a c-terminal tail  <cit> . mmp- <dig> is expressed in many tissues at mrna level  <cit>  although its expression at protein level appears to be more restricted. vascular smooth muscle cells, myoepithelial cells, and basal keratinocytes express mmp- <dig> constitutively whereas endothelial cells, epithelial cells of the mammary glands as well as monocytes and macrophages show differential regulation of this enzyme  <cit> .

mmp- <dig> was reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins such as type iv collagen, laminin  <dig> Î³ <dig> chain, tenascin c, and nidogen- <dig>  <cit> . this capacity together with the expression pattern may point to a role of mmp- <dig> in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. in the present study, we report that recombinant mmp- <dig> specifically generates angiostatin-like fragments from plasminogen, which inhibit proliferation and capillary-growth of endothelial cells.

RESULTS
gst-mmp- <dig> processes glu-type plasminogen to angiostatin-like fragments
to assess if plasminogen is a substrate of mmp- <dig>  we used two types of the protein, glu- and lys-type plasminogen. whereas the glu-variant is the native form of the protein, the lys-variant is generated by cleavage of the peptide bond between lys <dig> and lys <dig> by plasmin. in contrast to the glu-type plasminogen, we observed self-degradation of the lys-type form, even in the presence of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin. thus, we decided to continue the experiments with the glu-type variant, which does not have any plasmin activity and nearly no self-degradation. as controls, we used samples with mmp inhibitor  or the inactive mmp- <dig> mutant  instead of the wild-type fusion protein. the mmp- <dig> fusion protein was generated and purified as described in "methods". the expected size of the purified fusion protein was  <dig> kda as detected by coomassie staining and immunoblotting using anti-mmp- <dig> antibody . the strong protein band of approximately  <dig> kda appearing in the coomassie stained sds-page is a peptide composed of the n-terminal gst-tag and the propeptide domain of mmp- <dig>  which is generated during purification due to autocatalytic activity of mmp- <dig> 

we also used recombinant murine mmp- <dig> in an initial experiment as it was published that mmp- <dig> generates angiostatin like fragments  <cit> . the same experimental conditions were applied to both mmps to be able to compare their efficiency of both mmps. the processing of plasminogen by mmp- <dig> was not as efficient as the one of mmp- <dig>  thus, it was not included in the following experiments .

processing of human glu-type plasminogen by mmp- <dig> for  <dig> h generates several fragments with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> kda , some of them correspond to the angiostatin-like fragment . the protein band about  <dig> kda represents the full-length glu-type plasminogen. as the angiostatin-like fragments consist of the n-terminal part of plasminogen the bands below  <dig> kda are the corresponding c-terminal parts of the cleaved protein. comparing the time course of this reaction, an increase of the putative angiostatin-like fragments over time was obvious . fragments that occurred and disappeared during the incubation are intermediate products that are further processed to the final pattern of fragments .

plasminogen processed by gst-mmp- <dig> inhibits proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells
to investigate anti-angiogenic properties of generated plasminogen fragments, we first analyzed their effect on proliferation of hmec- <dig> endothelial cells using the alamar blue proliferation assay . cell proliferation started to decrease after  <dig> h  in the presence of the processed plasminogen and was reduced about 27% compared to full-length plasminogen after  <dig> h . this proliferation decrease appears to be due to the presence of active angiostatin-like fragments in the digested plasminogen mixture. recombinant mmp- <dig>  alone does not show any inhibition of the proliferation.

capillary-like formation is inhibited by fragments generated by mmp-19
to assess the effect of plasminogen fragments generated by mmp- <dig> on endothelial cell differentiation, in vitro angiogenesis assays were performed. hmec- <dig> cells were placed on matrigel in egm-mv medium containing recombinant mmp- <dig> , plasminogen , or cleavage products of plasminogen. the cells were examined after  <dig> h of incubation regarding the induction of formation of tube-like structures . the tube formation of the cells treated with the processed plasminogen mixture was remarkably reduced in comparison to the control. the amount of capillary-like structures was about 47% less in the treated than in control wells .

plasminogen processed by gst-mmp- <dig> decreases the phosphorylation of c-met and akt/pkb
because angiostatin blocks hgf-induced angiogenesis by inhibition of phosphorylation of its cell surface receptor c-met, we analyzed whether the angiostatin-like fragments generated by mmp- <dig> mediated the described effects  <cit> . as demonstrated by western blot analysis, phosphorylation of c-met in hmec- <dig> cells was inhibited by 27% after treatment with processed plasminogen compared to plasminogen . we further analyzed phosphorylation of akt/pkb after treatment with the angiostatin-like fragments. apart from c-met, akt signaling is also essential in angiogenesis as it affects the cell cycle and therefore proliferation. we observed a decrease of 45% of the phosphorylated form of akt kinase after treatment with processed plasminogen compared to plasminogen .

discussion
plasminogen, a single-chain glycoprotein of  <dig> kda consisting of an n-terminal peptide, five kringle domains, and a serine protease domain  <cit> , plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis where localized proteolysis is required. under certain conditions, plasminogen undergoes proteolysis to form kringle-containing a-chain fragments, collectively called angiostatins  <cit> , which are novel and potent inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis  <cit> . typically, angiostatin consists of the first four kringle domains . plasminogen is cleaved by several proteases, among them members of matrix metalloproteinase family, that are derived from tumor cells or infiltrating macrophages  <cit> . these kringle domains and their relatives inhibit the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, a fundamental process in angiogenesis  <cit> .

as mmp- <dig> was reported to be expressed by endothelial cells as well as cells that surround endothelium and capillaries, it could be expected that its activity likely impacts vascular processes including angiogenesis. our experiments show that mmp- <dig> has angiostatin-converting enzyme activity and generates angiostatin-like fragments similar to mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  <cit> . the cleavage site is located between kringle  <dig> and the protease domain to generate angiostatin molecules consisting of all five kringle domains of plasminogen. as all reported angiostatin species exhibit the biological activities of angiostatin isolated from plasma , the angiostatin-like fragments generated by mmp- <dig> should also have such biological activities.

angiogenic growth factors and inflammatory cytokines can induce a number of pericellular acting proteases, including mt1-mmp, mmp- <dig>  mmp- <dig>  and u-pa. this is generally seen as a part of the repertoire of cellular activities that are switched on when the pro-angiogenic growth factors overrule the angiogenesis-inhibiting factors. however, this unidirectional view on the relation between angiogenic growth factors and proteases has evolved into the insight that proteases themselves also contribute to fine-tuning of the activities of various growth factors that control the onset and progression of angiogenesis  <cit> . different members of the mmp family may generate angiostatin-like fragments with different efficiency and with different composition. the contribution of mmp- <dig> and other mmps to angiostatin generation in vivo will depend on their expression pattern, the rate of their activity, and also inactivation by endogenous inhibitors. this mechanism may be further complicated by interactions between different mmps as well as by multiple proteolytic activities towards extracellular matrix proteins in basement membrane or vascular bed. thus, mmp- <dig> could further increase its anti-angiogenic effect by damage of basement membrane scaffold that supports differentiation processes of endothelial cells. mmp- <dig> could achieve this by cleavage of at least three important basement membrane components: tenascin c, Î³2chain of laminin <dig>  and nidogen- <dig>  <cit> . in our previous study we could show that high concentrations of mmp- <dig> might have negative influence on endothelial cell growth as mmp-19-dependent processing of nidogen- <dig> led to inhibition of tube-like formation in vitro  <cit> . as higher concentrations of mmp- <dig> could influence or interfere with effects of processed plasminogen we tested the remaining mmp- <dig> fusion proteins in the processed plasminogen mixture on endothelial cells as well. however, mmp- <dig> under these experimental conditions did not exhibit any effect on the cells.

moreover, current data show that mmp- <dig> exhibit also critical antitumor activity as secreted active mmp- <dig>  but not the inactive mutant, induces reduction of tube-forming ability in endothelial cells with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor . thus, mmp- <dig> seems to be responsible, at least partly, for bioavailability of mmp- <dig> and vegf that promote angiogenesis  <cit> . in contrast, the mmp-19-deficient mice showed decreased tumor angiogenesis and invasion  <cit>  pointing, thus, to a potential dual role of mmp- <dig>  the pro-angiogenic role of mmp- <dig> could be associated with its expression in microvascular endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells  <cit> , and in the controlled release of pro-angiogenic factors such as vegf and mmp-2; the anti-angiogenic effect of mmp- <dig> might originate from uncontrolled overproduction of this mmp from various surrounding cellular sources, which can disrupt the necessary ecm scaffold or, as here reported, produce angiostatin-like fragments.

as mmp- <dig> generates angiostatin-like fragments that subsequently inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and tube-like formation, we asked, which pathways are involved in this inhibition. c-met is the hgf receptor that controls cellular mobility due to tyrosine-kinase activity. hgf binding to its receptor induces the tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor catalytic domain that initiates the intracellular signaling. angiostatin has structural similarities to hgf that promotes angiogenesis, induces proliferation, migration, and also influences cell survival via its cell surface receptor, c-met. upon hgf stimulation, c-met induces several biological responses that collectively give rise to a program known as invasive growth. it is thought that angiostatin inhibits hgf-induced phosphorylation of c-met, akt, and erk1/ <dig> via binding to soluble c-met. angiostatin and c-met form a stable complex and affect signaling events induced by hgf but not by vegf or bfgf  <cit> .

the inhibition of akt phosphorylation by angiostatin is not solely a marker for the inhibition of hgf binding to c-met; instead, a reduction in phospho-akt could directly contribute to the disruption of angiogenesis. akt is a serine/threonine kinase that is rapidly activated as a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol  <dig>  kinase in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors, including hgf  <cit> . in this work we could show that mmp-19-processed plasminogen inhibits the hgf-induced phosphorylation of c-met and akt/pkb and that plasminogen fragments generated by mmp- <dig> impact proliferation and tube-like formation of endothelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here that mmp- <dig> processes human plasminogen and generates angiostatin-like fragments that inhibit proliferation microvascular endothelial cells, decreases the phosphorylation of c-met, and reduce formation of capillary-like structures. thus, mmp- <dig> exhibits an anti-angiogenic effect on endothelial cells via generation of angiostatin-like fragments.
