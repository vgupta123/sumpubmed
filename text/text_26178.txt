BACKGROUND
numerous small non-coding rnas of 18– <dig> bases in length, called micrornas , have been found to play important roles in silencing specific target genes. recently vasudevan et al.  <cit>  have shown that mirnas can also activate gene expression, inducing translation up-regulation of target messager rnas  on cell cycle arrest. the total estimated number of reasonably conserved mirnas in vertebrates varies from  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig>  <cit> . in human, bentwich et al.  <cit>  suggested that the total number of mirnas is above  <dig>  the sequences of many mirnas are conserved among distantly related organisms  <cit> , but recent evidences demonstrated the presence of primate-specific mirnas  <cit> . mirnas are transcripts which are cleaved from a ~ <dig> nucleotides hairpin precursor by dicer  <cit> . they regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through binding to their target mrnas by base-pairing and subsequently inducing either translational repression or mrna destabilization  <cit> . mirnas are involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, cell proliferation, development and apoptosis  <cit> .

several methods are used to characterize the mirna expression profiles in specific tissues such as northern blotting, rnase protection assay, rt-pcr and microarray analyses. all these approaches depend on the prior knowledge of the mirna sequences. if the accurate profiling of known mirna expression represents an important tool to investigate physiological and pathological states, the discovery of new mirnas is still important. bioinformatics' strategies and mirna gene prediction algorithms have been used to screen genome sequences and to identify potential mirnas . schematically, the bioinformatic' approaches scan genomic sequences for the phylogenetic conservation of short nucleotides motifs located within genomic stretches that have the structural characteristics, ie secondary structures, of mirna precursors. however such gene predictions may not reveal all mirnas, and might especially miss those that are not phylogenetically conserved. furthermore, all these in silico predictions require independent experimental validations. in contrast, the cloning approaches allowed the identification of mirnas without prior knowledge of their sequences , but limit the identification only to those mirnas present at specific moments in the studied organ.

the mammary gland is a dynamic organ whose structure changes throughout the female reproductive cycle. these successive physiological stages, that are regulated by hormones, growth factor ligands, their receptors and some transcriptional factors, are characterized by proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of the mammary epithelial tissue which is embedded in the stroma .

an implication of mirnas in mammary gland biology was suggested by few studies mainly focusing on pathological situations, such as the appearance of breast cancer . some mirnas were found deregulated in human breast cancers  <cit> . recently the role of specific mirnas  in the regulation of the human estrogen receptor-α in breast cancer cell lines has been demonstrated  <cit> . moreover some mirnas expression profiles have been used to identify human breast cancer tumor subclasses  <cit> . in the normal mammary gland the expression of known mirnas has been studied in human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  at different developmental stages and found to be regulated. moreover the identification and characterization of mirnas from the bovine mammary tissue by gu et al.  <cit>  allowed the cloning of  <dig> distinct mirnas, including  <dig> novel ones. recently, ibarra et al.  <cit>  showed that several mirnas are involved in the maintenance of mouse mammary epithelial progenitor cells. the full repertoire of mirnas expressed in one tissue, in a specific condition or in specific cell types is not yet available and could revealed specific mirnas. the mammary gland which is an evolutionary recent organ is a good candidate to search for such tissue-specific mirnas.

RESULTS
cloning of new mirnas from mouse mammary gland
using the small rna cloning method described by lagos-quintana et al.  <cit> , cdna libraries were constructed from rna samples of mouse mammary glands collected at different stages . a total of  <dig> clones were obtained and sequenced, of which  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> non redundant sequences, had inserts ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length . most of the remaining clones contained inserts smaller than  <dig> nt and were not further analysed. the  <dig> non redundant sequences were compared with known mirnas by searching the mirbase database . nine sequences matched with mature mirnas,  <dig> of them perfectly with mouse let-7b , let-7c  and human mir- <dig>  respectively,  <dig> with a 1-nt difference with mouse mir-126-5p , mir- <dig>  and human mir- <dig> , and  <dig> have partial homologies . human mir- <dig> is 100% homologous with the mouse genomic sequence. the above-mentioned  <dig> sequences that perfectly matched with known mirnas were thus considered as corresponding to true mirnas and not further analysed. thirty-three sequences have partial homologies with  <dig> or several precursors of different species, among them  <dig> have partial homology with the mirna strand,  <dig> with the mirna* strand and  <dig> with the loop .

one important criteria that distinguishes mirna from other endogenous small rna is the ability of their genomic flanking sequences to adopt a hairpin structure with the mature mirna properly positioned within one of its strand in order to be excised during dicer processing  <cit> . the  <dig> sequences cloned were aligned with the mouse genome using blast,  <dig> of them were not found to be homologous. they were discarded; and considered as being cloning artefacts. for some of them we cannot exclude that the mismatches observed are due to rna editing  <cit> . among the  <dig> homologous sequences,  <dig> showed homology with a single location, whereas the others could be located in several genomic regions, leading overall to a total of  <dig> localisations. to assess which of the  <dig> regions correspond to potential mirna genes, their secondary structures were studied using the rna folding program mfold  <cit> . one hundred and fourteen chromosomal regions, which correspond to  <dig> cloned sequences, could form a stable hairpin structure. among the  <dig> chromosomal regions,  <dig> were annotated as ribosomal rna or small nuclear rna and were discarded. the  <dig> remaining corresponded to  <dig> cloned sequences.

their chromosomal locations and sequence alignments revealed that several cloned sequences were partially overlapping and could derive from the same precursor. in our study  <dig> families, corresponding to  <dig> sequences, were detected . recently, the presence of variants has been reported after the characterization of cdna libraries of small rnas from porcine fibroblast cells  <cit>  and from bovine adipose tissue and mammary gland  <cit> . the 3'-end variants may thus arise from preferential degradation at the 3' end or from imprecise processing of mirna precursors by dicer, thereby generating mirnas with differing 3' ends  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that these mirna variants originate from multiple genomic loci. the functional specialization of mirna variants is still unknown. the  <dig> cloned sequences could derive from  <dig> precursors . in fact one cloned sequence could derive from several precursors . in some cases one cloned sequence possess i)  <dig> identical precursors localised in  <dig> different chromosomes , ii)  <dig> identical precursors clustered in one chromosome  or iii)  <dig> similar precursors  in two different chromosomes . overall the precursors are distributed on all the chromosomes but chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and y . chromosome  <dig> appears to contain more mammary gland mirna genes than any other chromosome. our result are in agreement with published results  <cit>  that showed that mirna genes are distributed among all the chromosomes but chromosome y. twenty-six of the precursors are localised in intergenic regions,  <dig> in genes  and  <dig> corresponds to one mirna non-fully characterised  . thus the majority of mirna genes are part of intergenic sequences  as observed by ro et al.  <cit> . by analysing the proximity of the  <dig> chromosomal locations in the mouse genome,  <dig> mirna clusters were observed . the mirna genes are in the same cluster if they are less than  <dig> bp apart on the same chromosome  <cit> . this physical proximity is consistent with recent reports of mirna clustering within the human genome  <cit> . among the  <dig> clusters,  <dig> correspond to the association of two new precursors, mg016- <dig> and mg016- <dig>  with  <dig> mirnas already described mmu-mir-689- <dig> and mmu-mir-689- <dig>  respectively . the cluster mg <dig> on chromosome  <dig> has three repeats of the same precursor.

the evolutionary conservation of the  <dig> new mirnas  was studied by comparison of their sequences with the human, rat, dog, monkey, chicken, danio rerio, monodelphis and ornithorhynchus anatinus genome sequences. only  <dig> were conserved in all the species studied. six were not detected in any other species . if the phylogenetic conservation of the mirna sequence is one of the criteria established by ambros et al.  <cit>  to characterize mirna, it is important to recall that for some species the sequencing of their genome is not complete enough to detect all the sequences cloned here. it remains that the bioinformatics' analysis performed in this study has allowed identifying mouse specific mirna.

expression profiling of the  <dig> new mirnas
mirna expression is generally examined to better understand their physiological function. in this study, the tissue expression profile was used to assess the mammary gland specificity of the new mirnas. in addition these analyses provide additional evidence for the identification of a bona fide mirna. expression of the  <dig> new mirnas cloned in this study was analysed using an adapted rt-pcr described by shi and chiang  <cit>  and ro et al.  <cit>  and detailed in the methods' section. using this approach, we could detect expression for  <dig> of them in at least one of the  <dig> analysed tissues . based upon the multi-tissues expression profiles, these new mirnas have been grouped into  <dig> categories: undetected , ubiquitously expressed , mammary specific , and expression in several but not all tissues . among the latter category, one is not expressed in the mammary gland stages used for the rt-pcr experiment .

0: non detected, x: detected

the expression profile is the same for the  <dig> mirnas present in the cluster mg113/mg130; mg <dig>  the characterization of the undetected mirnas was completed by studying their expression in some supplementary mammary gland stages . among the  <dig> mirnas, only  <dig> have been detected . among the  <dig> mirnas undetected  <dig> correspond to variants of different families. we cannot exclude that these  <dig> variants are cloning artefact or that this lack of detection is due to individual variation for such mirna families. in a same family all the variants are not expressed in the same tissues. a first analysis has allowed the identification of  <dig> mammary gland specific new mirnas, to confirm this preliminary result their expression has been studied by rt-pcr on more tissues . finally they were found not to be mammary gland specific: mg <dig> is expressed in all the tissues except kidney and heart; and mg <dig> is expressed in all the tissues except in ovary and kidney; mg <dig> have been detected in all tissues. mg <dig> was only found to be expressed in spleen and mammary gland.

in  <dig> cases the mirna is detected in mammary gland in involution but not in lactation, a result in agreement with the expression profile of known mirnas at different stages of the mammary gland biology obtained in our team . however, no correlation has been observed between the tissue-distribution of the mirna expression  and their evolutionary conservation , or between their mammary expression profile  and their conservation in mammals . and the  <dig> mirnas present only in the mouse genome are expressed in the  <dig> tissues tested. if in this study no mammary gland specific mirna have been identified, several new mirnas which are not ubiquitously expressed have been cloned.

functional validation of precursors detected by bioinformatics' analysis
the bioinformatics' analysis allowed the detection of potential precursors, but these results could not determine if these hairpin structures will be matured by rnase iii, drosha in the nucleus and dicer in the cytoplasm. the use of expression vectors in cell culture, allowing the synthesis of hairpin structures that are matured into mirnas, has already been demonstrated  <cit> . to test the functional validity of the precursors obtained by bioinformatics' analysis, we expressed them in transfected cells and checked for the presence of the mature mirnas. the constructs carrying the precursors  were transiently transfected in cos- <dig> cells and the expression of the mature mirnas  was studied by northern blot analysis . as a control the precursor of a known mirna  was used . this approach could be used to validate precursor of mirna.

CONCLUSIONS
in spite of the development of new tools, as the mirna arrays, the cloning approaches remain the only strategy to identify mirnas in a tissue at a specific stage. as the mammary gland is an evolutionary recent organ, it is a good candidate to search for new tissue-specific mirnas. our study provides evidence for the occurrence in this tissue of  <dig> already known mirnas and of  <dig> new mouse mirnas. among the  <dig> new mirnas, the expression of  <dig> of them was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis.

if none of them is mammary gland specific, some are not ubiquitous and are good candidates to further analyse their roles in the mammary gland biology.

one of the rules proposed by ambros et al.  <cit>  to characterize a mirnas is the phylogenic conservation of the mirna sequences. in our study, no correlation could be established between the expression and the evolutionary conservation of these new mirnas. our result is in agreement with the data obtained by berezikov et al.  <cit>  showing by comparing the mirna content of human and chimpanzee brain that evolution of mirnas is an ongoing process and that along with ancient, highly conserved mirnas, there are a number of emerging mirnas. farh et al.  <cit>  have suggested that the binding sites of mirnas to 3'utr do not necessarily have to be conserved among the different species. therefore the mirnas identified here that are conserved in non mammalian species could have also a specific role in the mammary gland, as the others. expression in the different stages of the mammary gland biology and target identification of these new mirnas will be critical for determining their functions.

this study has allowed the identification of  <dig> mouse specific mirnas, reinforcing the yet unique ability of the cloning approach to identify such evolutionary not conserved mirnas.
