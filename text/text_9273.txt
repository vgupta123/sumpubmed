BACKGROUND
corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is generally regarded as an important animal pathogen and the etiological agent of a disease that is commonly called caseous lymphadenitis  <cit> . this bacterium is predominantly isolated from sheep and goats , but has been recognized also in other animals, including horses and cattle   <cit> . the importance of caseous lymphadenitis varies greatly around the world, but this disease is found in all major sheep and goat production areas  <cit> . c. pseudotuberculosis is a significant cause of morbidity in sheep and goats, and caseous lymphadenitis in these animals resulted in economic losses, for instance in wool, milk and meat production  <cit> . c. pseudotuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that is able to survive and grow in macrophages, thus escaping the immune response of the host  <cit> . a close phylogenetic relationship between c. pseudotuberculosis and corynebacterium ulcerans was proposed as both species are unique among the corynebacteria in producing phospholipase d. the sphingomyelin-degrading enzyme is regarded as the major virulence factor for c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . this exotoxin promotes the hydrolysis of ester bonds in sphingomyelin in mammalian cell membranes and contributes to the spread of the bacterium from the initial site of infection to secondary sites within the host.

although infections due to c. pseudotuberculosis are predominantly observed in sheep and goats, infections due to this pathogen also occur in humans  <cit> . the number of human infections is rare, but it might be underestimated as corynebacteria are often considered as skin contaminants in clinical specimens  <cit> . published cases of human infections by c. pseudotuberculosis usually presented as suppurative lymphadenitis  <cit> , with the exception of one case of eosinophilic pneumonia  <cit> . most patients revealed a classical risk exposure of close contact with animals, in particular with sheep. c. pseudotuberculosis infects humans via superficial wounds, forming abscesses in the regional draining lymph nodes after an incubation period ranging from weeks to months. in most of the published cases, antibiotic treatment alone was unsuccessful and the antimicrobial therapy was therefore supplemented by surgical interventions  <cit> . the general problem in achieving an effective treatment of c. pseudotuberculosis infections in humans and animals is probably related to the facultative intracellular lifestyle of this bacterium, as it can survive and multiply in macrophages  <cit> . the cell death and subsequent release of the pathogen lead to necrotic lesions and the formation of thick collagen capsules that cannot be penetrated by antibiotics  <cit> .

in the present study, we characterize the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> that was isolated from the inguinal lymph node of a 12-year-old french girl with necrotizing lymphadenitis  <cit> . this patient had no underlying disease or predisposing conditions. the diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis was supported by  <dig> s rdna gene sequencing, a taxonomic classification of the bacterial isolate and western blot assays revealing the presence of phospholipase d in the patient's serum. the patient relapsed many times despite a surgical drainage and an adapted antimicrobial treatment, although c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> turned out to be highly susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics in vitro. however, the patient recovered after a broad spectrum intravenous antimicrobial therapy with imipenem-cilastatin, rifampin and ofloxacin for four months, followed by an oral therapy with rifampin and ofloxacin for six months  <cit> . here, we report the functional annotation of the complete genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  the detection of potential virulence factors and the deduced gene-regulatory networks controlling their expression.

RESULTS
pyrosequencing and annotation of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome
the dna sequence of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> chromosome was determined by a whole-genome shotgun approach using pyrosequencing. a quarter of a sequencing run with the genome sequencer flx instrument yielded  <dig>  reads and  <dig> , <dig> bases that were assembled into ten large contigs  and one small contig , indicating a very low number of repetitive sequences in the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome. a search for repetitive dna elements in the complete genome sequence revealed the absence of insertion sequences in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  whereas the small contig was present in three tandem copies in the assembled chromosome . the remaining gaps were closed by a pcr strategy that was supported by the related reference contig arrangement tool r2cat  <cit> , using the corynebacterium diphtheriae nctc  <dig> genome sequence as a reference  <cit> . the final assembly of the dna sequences yielded a circular chromosome with a size of  <dig> , <dig> bp and a mean g+c content of  <dig> % . considering the final size of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> chromosome, a 40-fold coverage was initially obtained by pyrosequencing.

the annotation of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome sequence was performed with the gendb software system  <cit>  and resulted in the detection of  <dig>  protein-coding regions. furthermore,  <dig> trna genes were predicted by the trnascan-se program  <cit>  and four rrn operons were detected on the leading strands of the chromosome . a plot of the calculated g/c skew  indicated a bi-directional replication mechanism of the c. pseudotuberculosis chromosome . according to the presence and distribution of six conserved dnaa boxes, the oric is located downstream of the dnaa coding region  <cit> . the g/c skew and the biased distribution of architecture imparting sequences  on the leading and lagging strands indicated the presence of a dif region  <cit>  at the expected position of 180° from oric, dividing the chromosome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> into two replichores of similar size . synteny analysis by reciprocal best matches with blastp  <cit>  revealed a highly conserved order of orthologous genes between the chromosomes of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> and c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> , which is consistent with the close phylogenetic relationship of both species  <cit>  and the observation that genetic rearrangements are rare in the genomes of species belonging to the main lineage of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> . the calculated reciprocal best blastp hits  <cit>  were used also to compare the predicted proteome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> with the complete set of proteins encoded in the genome of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  <cit> . this comparative content analysis at the proteome level revealed that  <dig> proteins  of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> share a homologue in the genome of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> . the characteristic features of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> are apparently based on a distinct gene set, defining its lifestyle and pathogenicity, such as the pld gene encoding phospholipase d  <cit> . in the following sections, we describe a collection of relevant genes contributing to the lifestyle and pathogenicity of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> and deduce their integration into a transcriptional gene-regulatory network.

the transcriptional regulatory repertoire of c. pseudotuberculosis frc41
the repertoire of candidate transcription regulators encoded in the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome was deduced from the functional genome annotation taking into account the comprehensive knowledge of the reconstructed gene-regulatory network of corynebacterium glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit> . a collection of  <dig> genes encoding dna-binding transcription regulators, sigma factors and response regulators of two-component systems can be regarded as the minimal regulatory repertoire of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> . this set of candidate transcription regulators represents  <dig> % of the predicted protein-coding genes of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome. this value is in agreement with previous observations that less than 10% of the total number of predicted proteins are associated with transcriptional regulatory processes in bacteria  <cit>  and is in the range known from other pathogenic corynebacteria, such as c. diphtheriae and corynebacterium jeikeium  <cit> . the collection of potential transcription regulators was grouped into regulatory protein families according to their amino acid sequence similarities and domain organizations  <cit> . this bioinformatic classification assigned the candidate transcription regulators to  <dig> regulatory protein families, with one regulator  remaining unclassified. the regulatory protein families detected in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> vary significantly in their number of representatives . the largest family of dna-binding transcription regulators is tetr with  <dig> members, followed by gntr with  <dig> proteins. the tetr family of transcription regulators is widely distributed among bacterial species  <cit>  and is also the most prevalent group of regulatory proteins in other corynebacteria  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the detected collection of transcription regulators includes only  <dig> out of the  <dig> proteins that hitherto constituted the core of dna-binding transcription regulators in corynebacteria, as c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> lacks a gene for an orthologue of the conserved tetr regulator mfsr   <cit> . the knowledge of the transcriptional regulatory repertoire of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> was combined with regulons contributing to virulence by bioinformatic motif searches for dna-binding sites of prominent regulatory proteins.

iron regulation in physiology and virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis
for most bacteria, iron is essential as a cofactor for proteins involved in important cellular functions, such as dna biosynthesis and respiration  <cit> . thus, iron acquisition is a vital function for bacterial survival. as iron limitation is a common strategy by which a mammalian host suppresses bacterial growth, iron has a decisive role in infectious diseases. on the one hand, pathogenic bacteria have to compete for iron in the host so that they can multiply and establish a successful infection. on the other hand, they must regulate iron metabolism to prevent excess iron that can initiate the generation of toxic oxygen radicals from normal products of metabolism by fenton chemistry. bacteria have solved the problem of iron acquisition and homeostasis by encoding a variety of high-affinity uptake systems that are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the fagcba-fagd genes of c. pseudotuberculosis, for instance, encode an iron uptake system that is regulated by iron in vitro  <cit> . a fag mutant showed a reduced virulence in a goat model of caseous lymphadenitis when compared with a wild-type control, although no defect in iron utilization by the mutant strain was determined  <cit> . as the expression of the fagabcd genes contributed to the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis from animal sources, the complete genome sequence of frc <dig> was screened for the presence of these genes, additional iron uptake systems and the responsible transcription regulator .

the dtxr gene of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> encodes a homologue of the diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr that is activated by iron and controls a complex gene-regulatory network involved in iron homeostasis in corynebacteria  <cit> . the detection of a putative dtxr-binding site in the faga-fagd intergenic region supports the previously observed differential expression pattern of the fagabc operon in vitro  <cit> . we combined the functional annotation of the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome sequence with a bioinformatic motif search for dtxr-binding sites using a hidden markov model and a position weight matrix with input data from the dtxr regulon of c. glutamicum  <cit> . in this way, additional genes were assigned to the dtxr regulon of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  including several gene clusters involved in the utilization of various host compounds as iron sources . one gene region revealed similarity to the hemin utilization system hmutuv from c. diphtheriae  <cit> . the corresponding hemin binding protein htaa is probably associated with the cell envelope and involved in the utilization of heme iron  <cit> . two gene clusters assigned to the dtxr regulon of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> include htaa-like genes  that are associated with genes encoding membrane proteins , suggesting a role of these clusters in the acquisition of iron from the host . the hmuo gene of the dtxr regulon encodes heme oxygenase that releases iron from the protoporphyrin ring of heme and facilitates the acquisition of iron from heme and hemoglobin  <cit> . because of the potential toxicity of both, iron and heme, the expression of hmuo in c. diphtheriae is under complex control, comprising the iron-responsive repressor dtxr and the heme-dependent activators chra and hrra that are part of the two-component signal transduction systems chra-chrs and hrra-hrrs  <cit> . a blast search across the c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> genome revealed two response regulators that share similarity with chra and hrra. as the hrra gene of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is part of the dtxr regulon, a complex hierarchical control of hmuo gene expression might be established in this bacterium .

iron acquisition can moreover involve the synthesis and secretion of high-affinity iron chelators, termed siderophores, which are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases or by biosynthesis pathways independent of these multimodular enzymes  <cit> . the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> contains two dtxr-regulated gene clusters that are probably associated with pathways for siderophore biosynthesis independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases . the ciu locus comprises the ciuabcd , ciue  and ciuf  genes. the predicted product of the ciue gene is similar to aerobactin biosynthesis enzymes  <cit> . the expression of the ciua gene encoding the lipoprotein receptor of the abc transport system has been detected in vivo by a reporter transposon system  <cit> . the ciu gene region detected in the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is similar to the ciu gene locus from c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  with the exception that it lacks the ciug gene, encoding a protein of unknown function  <cit> .

the second dtxr-regulated gene cluster related to siderophore biosynthesis and excretion includes four genes probably constituting the biosynthesis pathway , a gene encoding an efflux protein  and four genes encoding an abc-type transporter  . ornithine cyclodeaminase  and ornithine decarboxylase  as well as monooxygenase  and synthetase  functions encoded in this gene cluster are components of widely distributed routes for siderophore biosynthesis  <cit> . additional dtxr-binding sites were detected in front of ftn  and fas  and the sdhcab  operon that are also part of the dtxr regulon in c. glutamicum  <cit> . ferritins act primarily in iron storage and are thus central to the natural regulation of iron in the bacterial cell  <cit> .

furthermore, the ripa gene encoding a dna-binding transcription regulator of the arac protein family was assigned to the dtxr regulon of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> . the expression of the orthologous ripa gene from c. glutamicum is also controlled directly by dtxr  <cit> . under iron limitation, the ripa protein acts as a repressor of genes coding for iron proteins in c. glutamicum  <cit> . candidate ripa-binding sites were detected by bioinformatic pattern searches in the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> in front of the acn  gene and upstream of the sdhcab  and cydabdc operons , thereby linking the availability of iron with the expression of genes in the citrate cycle and the respiratory energy metabolism of c. pseudotuberculosis. due to its high oxygen affinity, the cytochrome bd oxidase is used in many bacteria under microaerobic growth conditions  <cit> . additional ripa-binding sites were detected in front of the kata  gene and in the dps-fpg <dig>  intergenic region, integrating protective functions into the ripa regulon . dps-like proteins effectively protect dna against oxidizing agents by nonspecific dna-binding and physical sequestration that limits dna accessibility to detrimental factors  <cit> . they also act as iron-binding and storage proteins and catalyze the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron by h2o <dig>  which prevents the formation of hydroxyl radicals by the fenton reaction  <cit> . the lsr <dig> gene of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> encodes the multifunctional histone-like protein and transcription regulator lsr <dig>  that shares a number of physical properties with dps-like proteins and the ability to bind dna sequences with little specificity  <cit> . like dps, the lsr <dig> protein may physically protect corynebacterial dna against reactive oxygen intermediates  <cit> . formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase is a primary participant in the repair of dna lesions caused by oxidative damage  <cit> . a second gene  encoding formamidopyrimidine-dna glycosylase was detected in the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  but the upstream region of fpg <dig> apparently lacks a ripa-binding site. catalase is another important protective component in the bacterial oxidative stress response which is involved in the detoxification of h2o <dig>  <cit> . hence, the gene composition of the dtxr-ripa gene-regulatory network revealed the interdependence of iron metabolism and oxidative stress response and the regulatory connection between distinct physiological functionalities of the corynebacterial cell, including an important role in virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis.

manganese and zinc regulation in physiology and virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis
peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates are produced by macrophages as part of their antimicrobial response  <cit> . consequently, many pathogenic bacteria have evolved protection mechanisms against these reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates that have potent antimicrobial activity  <cit> . four genes encoding protective enzymes probably involved in corresponding detoxification reactions were identified in the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  including alkyl hydroperoxide reductase , manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase  and copper, zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase . a bioinformatic pattern search with actinobacterial oxyr-binding sites as input data revealed that these genes are most likely under transcriptional control by oxyr . the oxyr gene of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is linked to the ahpcd genes and its gene product may act as a repressor of gene expression  <cit> . ahpc is a member of a large family of peroxidases that contribute to the antioxidant defense in bacteria  <cit> . the ahpc protein directly reduces peroxides and is in turn reduced by ahpd  <cit> . the mycobacterial ahpc protein also catalyzes the rapid conversion of peroxynitrite to nitrite to avoid the formation of deleterious nitrogen dioxide and hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . superoxide dismutase converts superoxide anions into molecular oxygen and h2o <dig>  the latter being broken in turn to h2o by the enzymatic activity of catalase  <cit> . superoxide dismutases were classified into three evolutionarily distinct families according to the type of metal cofactors. most bacteria possess either a manganese-dependent  or an iron-dependent  superoxide dismutase in their cytoplasm, while secreted copper, zinc-dependent superoxide dismutases  have been detected in pathogenic or endosymbiontic bacteria  <cit> . the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> encodes two types of superoxide dismutases, a cytoplasmic mn-sod  and a secreted cu,zn-sod  that is characterized by a lipobox motif and may be anchored in the cell membrane  <cit> . the extracellular location of sodc suggests that it may protect the surface of c. pseudotuberculosis cells against superoxide generated externally by the mammalian host cells. likewise, the mycobacterial sodc protein contributes to the resistance of mycobacterium tuberculosis against oxidative burst products generated by activated macrophages  <cit> . the protective activity of cu,zn-sods has been associated with virulence in many bacteria, such as neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus ducreyi  <cit> . however, further experimental work is necessary to elucidate which protective enzyme contributes to the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis.

as manganese and zinc ions are apparently involved as cofactors in the oxidative stress response of pathogens, the corresponding regulons involved in metal ion uptake were identified in the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> . the uptake of manganese in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is mediated by a typical manganese abc-type transport system  that is negatively controlled at the transcriptional level by the metalloregulator mntr . the manganese abc transporter is composed of: a lipoprotein receptor , anchored to the cell membrane and functioning as an extracellular cation-binding protein; a cytoplasmic atp-binding protein ; and two integral membrane proteins  that mediate the cation flux  <cit> . a homologous gene cluster and its manganese-dependent transcriptional control by the metalloregulator mntr have been examined in the genome of c. diphtheriae  <cit> . the uptake of zinc ions in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is probably mediated by two abc transport systems , as both gene regions are specified by the presence of zur-binding sites . the zur protein is a metalloregulator of the ferric uptake regulator  family of dna-binding transcription regulators  <cit> . the znu abc transporter genes are key components of actinobacterial zur regulons and their expression is generally repressed by zur in a zinc-dependent manner  <cit> . zinc resistance might be facilitated in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> by the arsr-type transcription regulator znr that probably controls the expression of the czce gene encoding a cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux system  <cit> . the ycic gene coding for a putative p-loop gtpase of the cog <dig> protein family is also part of the zur regulon in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> . the ycic protein may function as a metallochaperone/insertase to enable the in vivo assembly of zinc-containing proteins under environmental conditions of zinc deficiency  <cit> .

moreover, the genome-wide motif search for zur-binding sites in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> detected three genes  encoding proteins with a carboxy-terminal sorting  signal that is generally used by gram-positive bacteria to anchor proteins to the cell wall  <cit> . the cpfrc_ <dig> protein contains two cnab-like domains that may be involved in the positioning of a ligand binding domain away from the corynebacterial cell surface and is encoded adjacent to a putative sialoprotein-binding protein. the secreted proteins cpfrc_ <dig> and cpfrc_ <dig> contain actinobacterial surface-anchored protein domains for their covalent attachment to the cell wall  <cit> . the cpfrc_ <dig> protein is encoded next to the components of a transporter and may act together with the cpfrc_ <dig> protein as a substrate receptor for this system. hence, the reconstruction of regulons participating in metal ion uptake of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> led to the detection of genes that may fulfill novel functions in sensing the presence of zinc in the environment.

genes encoding adhesive pili in c. pseudotuberculosis frc41
the complete set of predicted protein-coding regions of c. pseudotuberculosis fcr <dig> was subsequently screened for the presence of further proteins containing a typical sorting signal. this approach revealed ten additional proteins without any conserved domain organization  <cit>  that were annotated as hypothetical proteins with lpxtg motif and, more interestingly, six proteins showing similarity to subunits of adhesive pili from c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> . the corresponding coding regions are organized in two gene clusters that include sortase genes involved in the process of pilus polymerization  <cit> . the housekeeping sortase gene  of c. pseudotuberculosis fcr <dig>  necessary for the cell wall anchoring of pilin monomers and pilus polymers  <cit> , is located elsewhere in the chromosome. the adhesive pili of c. pseudotuberculosis fcr <dig> consist of major pilin subunits , minor pilin subunits  and tip proteins  that are characterized by conserved amino acid motifs . the function of the hypothetical proteins spax and spay encoded in the spa gene regions of c. pseudotuberculosis fcr <dig> is currently unknown. according to alkaline phosphatase  gene fusions generated with a reporter transposon system in c. pseudotuberculosis, at least the spaabc pilus is expressed in this species  <cit> . the spaabc gene cluster contains a putative dna-binding site for the camp-sensing transcription regulator glxr in the spaa-srtb intergenic region , thereby connecting the expression of pilus genes with a global gene-regulatory network in c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . the adhesive pili of c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig> are covalently anchored to the cell wall and can mediate the initial adhesion to host tissues and other bacterial cells  <cit> . the adherence of c. diphtheriae to pharyngeal epithelial cells is mediated also by the minor pilin of the adhesive pilus, as this pilin subunit is covalently anchored to the cell wall and can provide tight contact between the bacterial cell and the host tissue in the absence of a pilus shaft  <cit> . considering a similar functioning of the predicted spaabc and spadef pilus proteins from c. pseudotuberculosis, either a complete pilus structure or the minor pilins spab and spae can probably make the initial contact with host cell receptors to enable additional ligand-receptor interactions and to facilitate the efficient delivery of virulence factors and intracellular invasion.

candidate virulence factors of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> and their integration into a gene-regulatory network
the observation that adhesive pili promote the adherence of c. diphtheriae to host tissue suggests that the spaabc and spadef pili from c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> can be regarded as potential virulence factors  <cit> . to extend the view on proteins contributing to the pathogenicity of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  the genome sequence was screened for further candidate genes encoding virulence factors . the major virulence factor of c. pseudotuberculosis is the sphingomyelin-degrading phospholipase d that facilitates the persistence and spread of the bacterium within the host  <cit> . the expression of the pld gene is regulated by multiple environmental stimuli, including heat, and plays a role in the reduction of macrophage viability following infection  <cit> . the secreted corynebacterial protease cp <dig> was detected previously as a protective antigen of c. pseudotuberculosis and shown to be of the serine protease type, although blast searches revealed homology to endoglycosidases  <cit> . the extracellular cp <dig> enzyme may contribute to the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis by its proteolytic activity, but the enzymatic activity of cp <dig> was not detectable in culture supernatants  <cit> . however, vaccination of sheep with this antigen resulted in protection against infection with c. pseudotuberculosis, probably by affecting directly the function of the cp <dig> protein and indirectly the growth of the pathogen  <cit> . the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> revealed three additional genes encoding secreted proteases, including two subtilisin-like serine proteases and one trypsin-like serine protease . extracellular proteases may exhibit a wide range of pathogenic potentials when interacting with the defense mechanisms and tissue components of the host. redundant enzymatic systems are moreover suitable to promote the survival of pathogens under unfavorable environmental conditions encountered in the infected host  <cit> . the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> also encodes a secreted protein of the sgnh-hydrolase subfamily . sgnh-hydrolases are a diverse family of lipases and esterases which are known to act as virulence factors in other bacteria, such as streptomyces scabies, the causal agent of the potato scab disease  <cit> . further experimental studies are required to elucidate whether the expression of the secreted enzymes promotes the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> 

another candidate virulence factor of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is the extracellular neuraminidase nanh . neuraminidases, or sialidases, belong to a class of glycosyl hydrolases that catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from a variety of glycoconjugates and can contribute to the recognition of sialic acids exposed on host cell surfaces  <cit> . the homologous counterpart of nanh was recently characterized in c. diphtheriae kctc <dig> and shown to be a protein containing neuraminidase and trans-sialidase activities  <cit> . trans-sialidases located on the bacterial cell surface can be used for the decoration of sugar moiety acceptors with sialic acid to enable the invasion of hosts under certain conditions. the trans-sialidase activity is of importance for many pathogenic bacteria and the corresponding proteins are therefore considered potential virulence factors  <cit> . iron limitation reduced the number of sialic acid residues on the surface of c. diphtheriae cells and their adhesive properties, indicating that the expression of dissimilar virulence determinants is coordinately controlled by a gene-regulatory system  <cit> . by bioinformatic pattern searches, a glxr-binding site was detected in the upstream region of the nanh gene of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  suggesting that the camp-sensing transcription regulator glxr might be involved in the control of this virulence factor gene .

likewise, a dna-binding site for glxr was detected in front of the rpfi gene encoding an invasion-associated protein that is involved in cell surface organization and adhesion of corynebacteria  <cit> . the homologue of rpfi in m. tuberculosis  revealed endopeptidase activity and interacts with the resuscitation-promoting factor rpfb, representing a peptidoglycan glycosidase  <cit> . two genes  encoding resuscitation-promoting factors are present in the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> . important roles in pathogenesis for peptidoglycan hydrolytic enzymes have been proposed  <cit>  and an analogous system combining the activities of a muramidase and an endopeptidase contributed to the virulence of listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . as previously demonstrated in c. glutamicum  <cit> , the expression of rpfi, rpfa and rpfb in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is probably under complex control by three regulatory proteins, glxr, ramb and rama .

another potential virulence factor of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is represented by the nor gene encoding nitric oxide reductase . this enzyme is generally involved in the detoxification of nitric oxide and consequently necessary for the long-term persistence of pathogens in macrophages  <cit> . the toxic properties of nitric oxide are used by the host immune system to kill or slow down the growth of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of the nor gene was not induced upon the infection of macrophages by animal c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . as the expression of nor is typically activated by a transcription regulator in response to the presence of nitric oxide  <cit> , the regulatory pattern of nor transcription and its contribution to the protection against nitric oxide remains unclear.

the previous search for macrophage-induced genes of animal c. pseudotuberculosis by means of a cloned promoter library provided two gene tags showing significant induction rates in macrophages  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of the respective gene tags revealed similarity to nonribosomal peptide synthetases  and to the β-subunit of acyl-coa carboxylases , respectively. the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> encodes two nonribosomal peptide synthetases, nrps <dig> and nrps <dig> . these modular enzymes are used by microorganisms to participate in the synthesis of many secondary metabolites, including for instance siderophores and antibiotics  <cit> . as both nrps genes were not assigned to the iron-responsive dtxr regulon of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> and siderophore biosynthesis is carried out by alternative pathways independent of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, a physiological role in iron metabolism of the two proteins cannot be deduced from the current data. however, the strong upregulation of gene expression in macrophages points toward a protective or toxic function during the infection of at least one nonribosomal peptide synthetase  <cit> . a role in virulence of a secondary metabolite produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase has been demonstrated in streptomyces acidiscabies. this phytopathogen produces thaxtomin a which is necessary for the infection of potato tubers  <cit> .

three genes coding for β-subunits of acyl-coa carboxylases are present in the genome of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> . these genes are located in highly conserved regions of corynebacterial genomes and are essential for either fatty acid synthesis  or mycolic acid synthesis   <cit> . the acetyl-coa carboxylase of c. glutamicum consists of the biotinylated α-subunit accbc, the β-subunit accd <dig>  and the small acce protein. the acyl-coa carboxylase involved in mycolic acid synthesis of c. glutamicum consists of the two β-subunits accd <dig> and accd <dig>  in addition to accbc and acce  <cit> . the expression of the respective genes in c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> is probably controlled by the global transcription regulator glxr , providing hints that this regulatory protein has a key function in connecting both the central metabolism and the expression of candidate virulence factors in this pathogenic bacterium. mycolic acids, which are long-chain α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids, are important components of the corynebacterial cell wall  <cit>  and probably associated with the pathogenicity of c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . they can provide a thick layer at the outer surface of the cell that protects the bacterium from antibiotics and the host's immune system  <cit> . moreover, the noncovalently bound trehalose dimycolate is a well-established immunostimulatory compound with toxic properties  <cit> . variations in the amount of mycolic acids and differences in other cell surface properties provide a basis for explaining the aggregation capacity of c. pseudotuberculosis in suspension, the strong aggregation within macrophages, the formation of thick capsules after the release of the pathogen from macrophages  <cit> , and the occurrence of virulent and attenuated strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> of human origin provides detailed insights into the gene repertoire contributing to the virulence of this bacterium that was isolated from a rare case of necrotizing lymphadenitis  <cit> . by combining in silico data obtained from the genome annotation with previous experimental knowledge, occasional observations on genes that affect the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis were integrated into a global view on the pathogenicity of this species. the reconstruction of the dtxr regulon for instance provides a comprehensive set of genes involved in the acquisition of iron and extends the initial observation that a fagb mutant was not impaired in iron uptake  <cit> . a systematic mutational characterization of the newly detected iron transporters and siderophore biosynthesis gene clusters may help to dissect the contribution of each system to the virulence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  it is very likely that the ciu siderophore biosynthesis and transport system may complement the uptake of iron by the fagabcd transporter under certain environmental conditions, as the ciua gene was shown earlier to be expressed in c. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . likewise, a reporter transposon system indicated that a gene coding for a fimbrial subunit is expressed during growth of c. pseudotuberculosis in standard medium  <cit> . as the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> revealed two gene clusters encoding adhesive pili, it is interesting to examine how the respective pilin monomers or pilus polymers contribute to the adherence of c. pseudotuberculosis to host tissue and how their expression is controlled. we detected a dna-binding site for the camp-sensing transcription regulator glxr in the spaa-srtb intergenic region, whereas the iron-responsive regulator dtxr was proposed to control the assembly of pilin subunits in c. diphtheriae nctc  <dig>  <cit> . another previous study provided two dna sequence tags for macrophage-induced genes  <cit>  that were linked to the nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes nrps <dig> and nrps <dig> and to the acyl-coa carboxylase subunit genes dtsr <dig>  dtsr <dig> and accd <dig> by means of the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig>  the detection of the latter genes is consistent with the observation that the cell surface of c. pseudotuberculosis is an important factor contributing to virulence  <cit> . future work should compare the knowledge deduced from the genome sequence of c. pseudotuberculosis frc <dig> with the genetic information generated from other human isolates or animal pathogens of the different biovars  <cit> , or even extend the genome comparison to the pangenomic level. this global comparative approach with a larger set of sequenced genomes may provide comprehensive insights into the distinctive features of each biovar or strain. as the currently available commercial vaccines are unable to fully protect susceptible animals  <cit> , the extended knowledge of potential virulence factors and novel antigens of c. pseudotuberculosis might be helpful for the design of more effective vaccines and molecular diagnostics to control caseous lymphadenitis in sheep and goats to reduce thereby the occupational risk exposure for humans.
