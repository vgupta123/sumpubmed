BACKGROUND
poplars are keystone tree species in several temperate forest ecosystems in the northern hemisphere. poplars are also intensively cultivated in plantation forestry for the production of wood, pulp, and paper. fast growing poplars can serve functions in phytoremediation, as a sink for carbon sequestration, and as a feedstock for biofuel production. poplar has also been firmly established as a model research system for long-lived woody perennials . advances in functional genomics of poplar have been greatly enhanced by the availability of a high-quality genome sequence from p. trichocarpa , combined with comprehensive genetic  <cit>  and physical genome  <cit>  maps, as well as the availability of several platforms for transcriptome analysis  <cit>  and genetic transformation. large collections of expressed sequence tags  have also been developed from a variety of poplar species and hybrids focussing on gene discovery in wood formation, dormancy, floral development and stress response  <cit> . these short, single-pass est reads have been a critical resource for gene discovery, genome annotation, and the construction of microarray platforms.

high-accuracy, sequence-verified flcdna sequences that span the entire protein-coding region of a given gene can advance comparative, functional, and structural genome analysis. for example, the accuracy of ab initio prediction of protein-coding regions in genome sequences is limited by the difficulty of finding islands of coding sequences within an ocean of non-coding dna, and by the complexity of individual genes that may code for multiple peptides through alternative splicing. more robust approaches that unambiguously identify protein-coding regions in a genome sequence have used flcdna data, as demonstrated for example in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . despite their immense value, sequence-verified flcdna clones, where multiple passes verify the authenticity of reads, have not been generated in most plant species subjected to genomic analysis. only a few large flcdna data sets have been generated for plants; namely for rice  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . in contrast, as of september  <dig>  there were only  <dig>  complete sequences from individual poplar flcdna clones in the non-redundant  division of genbank, in addition to a larger number of putative full-length sequences assembled from est reads of multiple cdna clones.

our poplar flcdna program in the areas of forest health genomics and wood formation has focused on mechanisms of defense and resistance against insects and genes associated with xylem development. the forest tent caterpillar  is a major insect pest that threatens the productivity of natural and plantation forests. poplars deploy an array of combined defense strategies against herbivores that can be grouped as chemical and physical defenses, direct and indirect defenses, constitutive and induced defenses, as well as local and systemic defenses . several recent studies have been conducted on the molecular mechanisms underlying inducible defenses against herbivores in poplar  <cit> .

in this paper, we report on the development of four flcdna libraries from poplar that served as the starting template for creating a substantial genomic resource of  <dig>  sequence-verified flcdnas. we describe the overall structural features of these flcdna clones, annotation based on comparisons with other species, and the identification of  <dig> putative poplar-specific transcripts. mapping the flcdna collection to the poplar genome sequence confirmed the overall high quality of the assembled genome sequence as well as the high quality of the flcdna resource, while also identifying  <dig> expressed poplar transcripts that appear to be derived from gap regions of the current genome sequence assembly and  <dig> new poplar genes that have not previously been identified in the genome assembly. by mapping  <dig>  flcdnas to a poplar  <dig>  k cdna microarray platform and performing a comparison with existing transcriptome data, we identified  <dig> flcdnas that match transcripts differentially expressed following insect attack by ftc on poplar leaves.

RESULTS
selection and sequence finishing of flcdnas
flcdnas are defined as individual cdna clones that contain the complete protein-coding sequence and at least partial 5' and 3' untranslated regions  for a given transcript. this definition distinguishes bona fide flcdnas from in silico assembled est sequences derived from multiple cdna clones. in the latter case, it is possible that multiple, closely related genes or allelic variants of the same gene are assembled into a single consensus sequence. this problem is avoided when only sequences derived from the same physical flcdna clone are assembled. we prepared four flcdna libraries using the biotinylated cap trapper method  <cit> . three libraries constructed from xylem, phloem and cambium, and green shoot tips and leaves were derived from the p. trichocarpa nisqually- <dig> genotype, for which the genome sequence has been reported  <cit> . an additional library was developed from the p. trichocarpa × p. deltoides hybrid h11– <dig> genotype using leaves subjected to ftc herbivory .

to select candidate flcdnas for complete insert sequencing, we used a previously described bioinformatic pipeline for est processing  <cit> . an initial set of  <dig>  3' ests derived from flcdna libraries was combined with  <dig>  3' ests from standard est libraries  <cit>  to generate a starting set of  <dig>  3'-end ests, which resulted in  <dig>  high-quality ests after filtering to remove sequences of low quality and contaminant sequences from yeast, bacteria and fungi. these sequences were then clustered using the cap <dig> assembly program  to identify a set of  <dig>  putative unique transcripts . to maximize the capture of complete open reading frames  and utrs, only clones from full-length libraries were considered further. using this strategy, we identified  <dig>  cdna candidate clones for full insert sequencing, which resulted in  <dig>  sequence-verified poplar flcdna clones . inserts of  <dig>  clones were completely sequenced using end reads only, with an average sequenced insert size of  <dig> ±  <dig> bp  and required an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  end reads to finish to high sequence quality. using a combination of end reads and primer walking, inserts of an additional  <dig>  clones were completely sequenced, with an average insert size of  <dig>  ±  <dig> bp requiring  <dig>  ±  <dig>  end reads and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  internal primer reads per clone.

analysis of the  <dig>  flcdna sequences using the cap <dig> clustering and assembly program  identified  <dig>  flcdnas as unique singletons, with the remaining  <dig>  grouping into  <dig> contigs, suggesting a total of  <dig>  unique genes represented with finished flcdna sequences. the high percentage of unique transcripts  within this set confirms the successful clone selection strategy  for establishing a low-redundancy clone set prior to sequence finishing.

sequence quality and "full-length" assessment of poplar flcdnas
all  <dig>  finished flcdnas achieved a minimum of phred <dig>  sequence quality at every base. the majority of flcdnas were of even higher quality with the minimum and average phred values exceeding phred <dig>  and phred <dig> , respectively . we predicted the complete protein-coding orfs for all  <dig>  flcdnas. the distribution of 5' utr, orf and 3' utr lengths is illustrated in figure  <dig> . the average sequenced flcdna length  was  <dig>  ±  <dig> bp , and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, whereas the average predicted orf was  <dig> ±  <dig> bp and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. orfs could not be detected  for  <dig> flcdnas. the 5' and 3' utrs averaged  <dig> ±  <dig> bp and  <dig> ±  <dig> bp, respectively. these results are comparable to cap trapper flcdna collections from other plant species including maize , arabidopsis  and rice . similarly, the average transcript length of the  <dig>  poplar reference genes predicted ab initio from the genome sequence was  <dig>  bp and 5' and 3' utrs averaged  <dig> bp  <cit> , in close agreement with our results obtained with flcdnas.

to further assess the quality of the  <dig>  poplar flcdnas, we performed reciprocal blast analysis against peptide sequences in the arabidopsis information resource  and against a set of  <dig>  poplar sequences previously identified to be full-length . reciprocal blast analysis was performed with a stringent similarity threshold  and identified  <dig>  and  <dig> pairs, respectively, with arabidopsis and previously published poplar flcdnas . of the  <dig> homologous poplar transcript pairs ,  <dig>  agreed well with regard to their orf lengths and position of their start and stop codons . for the remaining pairs, the predicted 5' and/or 3' orf ends did not match suggesting alternative start or stop codons, splice variants, or the possibility that one of the pair members was either truncated or had an incorrectly predicted orf. when comparing the poplar flcdna collection to reciprocal matches from tair arabidopsis peptides, we observed a similar number of  <dig>   pairs with similar orf lengths and positions of their starting methionine and stop codons . these results indicate the majority of the  <dig>  poplar flcdnas represent true full-length transcripts with complete orfs and correctly annotated start and stop codons.

mapping flcdnas to the poplar genome sequence to reassess gene prediction and to identify possible gaps in the genome assembly
as part of the poplar genome sequencing project  <cit> , the poplar flcdnas were used to train a series of gene prediction algorithms to identify coding regions in the genome sequence. to reassess the effectiveness of gene prediction in the current genome assembly and to search for possible genome sequence gaps, we took two approaches: 1) blat  <cit>  was utilized to map flcdnas to the assembled genome sequence, and 2) blastn was applied to align flcdnas with the  <dig>  protein-coding gene loci predicted from the poplar genome sequence. using blat, we mapped  <dig>  poplar flcdnas  to the genome at a minimum threshold . from this set,  <dig>   mapped to the  <dig> linkage groups  whereas the remainder mapped to scaffold segments that were not incorporated into the poplar genome sequence assembly. examination of the linkage group location of flcdnas suggests a pattern of random distribution when grouped by cdna library/tissue of origin, with an approximately even distribution of flcdnas throughout the genome . when we applied a more stringent similarity threshold , the number of poplar flcdnas matching to the genome was only slightly reduced to  <dig>  .

in addition to blat analysis, we also compared the flcdnas with the  <dig>  predicted protein-coding gene loci identified in the genome sequence using blastn and observed  <dig>   matched at an e value < 1e- <dig> . in order to identify possible sequence gaps in the  <dig> × coverage genome, we searched for flcdnas lacking a stringent blat to the genome match and a blastn match  to the predicted gene models. this approach identified only  <dig> candidates, of which  <dig>  flcdnas also had a strong match by blastn  to one or more poplar ests in the public domain, excluding ests reported in this study , suggesting that these flcdnas represent expressed poplar genes that likely map to gap regions within the current genome draft. we cannot exclude the possibility that the remaining  <dig> flcdnas represent sequences from bacterial, fungal or insect species present on poplar tissues harvested for cdna library construction, which were not filtered as contaminant sequences in our est and flcdna processing procedures.

to identify expressed genes that were not predicted in the original genome annotation  <cit> , we searched among the set of  <dig>  flcdnas with a stringent blat match to the genome that did not match to any of the  <dig>  predicted gene models . this analysis revealed  <dig> flcdnas,  <dig> of which also showed strong similarity  to one or more poplar ests in the public domain , suggesting that these  <dig> flcdnas represent expressed genes and possibly non-coding rnas, that were missed by gene prediction software during the annotation of the poplar genome. the fact that these poplar transcripts had been missed could be due in part to the relatively short lengths of these  <dig> flcdnas .

comparative sequence annotation of poplar flcdnas against arabidopsis and other plants identifies proteins unique to poplar
despite the growing research interest in poplar as a model angiosperm tree species and the recent completion of the poplar genome sequence, poplar still represents a difficult experimental system with relatively few functionally characterized proteins, compared to other established model systems such as arabidopsis. therefore, our effort of in silico annotation of poplar flcdnas was largely based on comparison with arabidopsis together with the nr database of genbank containing sequences from all plants, among other species. using blastx, we found that the proportion of flcdnas with similarity to tair arabidopsis proteins was  <dig> %  at e value < 1e- <dig> and  <dig> %  at e value < 1e- <dig> . similar values were obtained when using blastx to compare against peptides from other species in the nr division of genbank  . as expected, the proportion of poplar flcdnas with sequence similarity to previously published poplar ests  by blastn was very high, with  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of flcdnas having matches with e values < 1e- <dig> and < 1e- <dig>  respectively .

to identify genes that are potentially unique to poplar, we next examined the relationship of sequence similarity among the poplar flcdnas and best matching sequences in the tair arabidopsis proteins, other nr database proteins , and previously published poplar est datasets. of the  <dig>  poplar flcdnas,  <dig>   had at least low sequence similarity to sequences in all three databases . only  <dig> flcdnas had no similarity  to sequences in any of these databases; however,  <dig> of these strongly matched to the poplar genome using blat . our results suggest that these  <dig> genes that are represented with flcdnas and with poplar genomic sequences are new genes that have not previously been identified in other poplar est collections or among genes in arabidopsis and other plant species .

in addition, we also identified  <dig> poplar flcdnas  with no similarity to arabidopsis or nr proteins , of which  <dig> flcdnas matched with high similarity to both the poplar genome by blat and to previously published poplar ests by blastn . these poplar flcdnas could represent genes that were gained and then rapidly diverged in sequence since the recent whole genome duplication in poplar, or they may also represent non-coding rnas or small peptides in poplar that share limited sequence similarity with other plants. the fact that these putative poplar-specific flcdnas do not share similarity with existing plant sequence data may also reflect the limited availability of sequence data from salicaceae species closely related to poplar in the current nr database. to test these putatively poplar-specific flcdnas for known functional domains, we performed a search of the pfam database  <cit> . at a threshold of e values < 1e- <dig>  we identified  <dig>   poplar flcdnas with similarity to a pfam domain; however, among the collection of  <dig> putatively poplar-specific genes only  <dig> flcdnas in this set matched a pfam domain . domain matches included pf <dig> /ribosomal protein l <dig> , pf <dig> /dss1/sem <dig> family , pf <dig> /unknown function , and pf <dig> /dna binding protein s1fa .

annotation of poplar flcdna transcripts affected by ftc herbivory
a major emphasis of the program that motivated the development and analysis of poplar flcdnas is the discovery of genes affected by insect attack. to identify herbivore-responsive genes among the poplar flcdnas, we first mapped the flcdna set onto a poplar  <dig>  k microarray based on blastn comparison to ests spotted on the array. this microarray platform was previously used for profiling of the poplar leaf transcriptome affected by ftc larvae feeding  <cit> . using a stringent similarity threshold of ≥ 95% identity over ≥ 95% alignment coverage, we identified  <dig>  flcdnas that matched with  <dig>  est elements on the array . although we did observe some cases of individual flcdnas mapping to multiple array elements, as well as multiple flcdnas mapping to the same array element, it should be noted that the in silico match stringency applied here is likely higher than the capability of cdna microarrays to discriminate among highly similar transcripts by actual dna hybridization. next, we identified poplar flcdnas with a role in the response to insect attack by screening the  <dig>  flcdnas against existing transcriptome data of differentially expressed  genes in leaves that were exposed for  <dig> hours to ftc feeding  <cit> . this approach resulted in the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> flcdnas that were induced or repressed, respectively, in ftc-treated leaves compared to untreated control leaves  using the de criteria of fold-change ≥  <dig> -fold, p value <  <dig>  and q value <  <dig> . a complete list of expression data is provided . each of the  <dig> flcdnas was translated and evaluated for the presence of orfs, and annotation was assigned based on manual examination of the highest scoring and most informative blastx matches in nr.

among ftc-induced transcripts represented with flcdnas, we identified a large number of defense-related and stress response proteins such as chitinases, kunitz protease inhibitors, dehydrins, beta- <dig> -glucanases, pathogenesis related protein pr- <dig>  and glutathione-s-transferase . several classes of transcription factors  were also strongly affected by ftc feeding such as bzip domain tfs, nac domain tfs, nam domain tfs and ethylene response factor tfs. a number of genes associated with signaling were also strongly affected by ftc feeding, including allene oxide cyclase involved in jasmonate formation and calreticulin associated with calcium signaling. we also observed a substantial number of flcdnas annotated as involved in phenolic metabolism, particularly flavonoid biosynthesis, including isoflavone reductase, epsp synthase, flavonoid 3-o-glycosyl transferase and flavanone 3-hydroxylase, along with several cytochrome p450s of unknown function . among the ftc-repressed transcripts represented with flcdnas, we observed photosystem ii proteins associated with photosynthesis, malate dehydrogenase and thiamine biosynthesis enzyme associated with primary metabolism, several zinc finger tfs, and stress-responsive proteins such as small heat shock and universal stress proteins . twenty two of the  <dig> ftc-responsive genes represented with flcdnas matched to hypothetical proteins of unknown function and nine have no obvious similarity to any proteins in the nr database.

discussion
previous studies using the biotinylated cap trapper method for flcdna library construction have demonstrated this technique to be highly effective for capturing predominantly true full-length clones in large-scale projects  <cit> . in this study, we generated a set of  <dig>  flcdnas, which represents the third largest plant flcdna resource published to date, behind only arabidopsis and rice. cap <dig> clustering and assembly indicates that more than 85% of the flcdnas are non-redundant within this collection. the average sequence length, orf and utr sizes of the poplar flcdnas were comparable to those observed with the cap trapper-derived flcdna collections for maize  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , and were also very similar to the ab initio predicted reference genes in the poplar genome sequence  <cit> . applying a reciprocal blast strategy, we demonstrated that among flcdnas with high sequence similarity to known arabidopsis peptides and/or previously published poplar flcdnas, nearly 80% had similar orf lengths and starting methionine and stop codon positions. collectively, these data show that the poplar flcdna libraries are of high quality and that our clone selection strategy combined with the cap trapper method was effective in capturing bona fide flcdnas from poplar.

comparison of poplar flcdnas and the poplar genome sequence assembly confirmed both the overall high accuracy of the current genome assembly, as well as the quality of the flcdna resource described here. however, as has been previously demonstrated with efforts to identify the complete catalogue of genes in arabidopsis and rice, gene prediction and genome assembly is an iterative process. the results reported here for the mapping of flcdnas to the poplar genome sequence reveal opportunities for improvement of the genome sequence assembly , as well as opportunities to further improve tools for the in silico prediction of genes. to address the discovery of apparent gaps in the genome assembly, the availability of  <dig> flcdnas that are not covered in the current assembly could be used to target bac clones for re-sequencing and filling of gap regions. similarly, the discovery of  <dig> flcdnas that do not have corresponding gene predictions in the current genome annotation may provide an opportunity to further improve gene prediction tools for poplar. algorithms used for gene prediction in the poplar genome sequence assembly could be tested with these  <dig> flcdnas to find out why they may have initially been missed. if this leads to an improvement of prediction tools, the assembled genome sequence could be tested with the modified tools to identify additional genes.

the comparative sequence annotation of poplar flcdnas against arabidopsis, the nr database, and previously published poplar ests revealed that ca. 88% of poplar flcdnas showed similarity to sequences in arabidopsis or other plants. many of the ca.  <dig> % of poplar flcdnas without significant sequence similarity in arabidopsis or other plants are supported with evidence of gene expression in the form of previously published poplar ests and matching the poplar genome sequence, thus excluding the possibility that they are artifacts of cdna library construction. the discovery of poplar flcdnas without matches in other plant species is also in agreement with previous analysis of the poplar genome sequence where 11% of predicted proteins had no similarity to proteins in the nr database and 12% had no similarity to arabidopsis proteins  <cit> . for comparison, only 64% of the  <dig>  orfs derived from rice flcdnas showed significant similarity to coding sequences predicted from the arabidopsis genome and conversely, only 75% of arabidopsis coding sequences had similarity to rice flcdnas  <cit> . these findings suggest that a substantial proportion of protein-coding sequences are not conserved among all plant species. the putative poplar-specific genes could be the product of past local or whole genome duplications in the lineage that led to extant poplar species  <cit>  followed by sequence divergence  <cit> . furthermore, ca. 2% of poplar flcdnas did not contain a predicted orf suggesting these putative poplar-specific genes likely encode non-coding rnas .

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a large flcdna resource of high sequence quality and low-level redundancy that facilitated the discovery of a substantial number of genes not present among the published sequences of other plant species, and that also facilitated the discovery of several hundred insect-affected genes in the poplar leaf transcriptome that were represented by flcdnas. the newly established poplar flcdna resource will be valuable for further improvement of the poplar genome assembly, annotation of protein-coding regions, and for functional and comparative analysis of poplar genes. specifically, the identification of flcdnas that are not covered in the current genome assembly or that were not predicted during the genome annotation provides opportunities to further refine the current genome assembly. the availability of a large collection of flcdnas that show altered gene expression following insect herbivory affords more rapid characterization of the role of these genes in poplar biotic interactions.
