BACKGROUND
cyclic nucleotide monophosphates  are ubiquitous second intracellular messengers which play an essential role in the transduction of a variety of extracellular signals. the control of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels is achieved by different enzymes, including cyclases that synthesize the cyclic nucleotides and catabolic enzymes such as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases . at least twenty one genes coding for cyclic nucleotide pdes have been identified in mammals. they have been classified in  <dig> families and in humans they code for more than  <dig> different isoforms through alternative splicing  <cit> .

the pde9a gene encodes a cgmp-specific high-affinity pde with widespread expression in most of the tissues examined  <cit> . the human pde9a gene is located on 21q <dig> , and has at least  <dig> exons spanning  <dig> kb. because of its mapping position pde9a is a possible candidate for genetic diseases mapped on 21q <dig> , such as bipolar affective disorder. furthermore, its overexpression might be involved in down's syndrome  <cit> . for these reasons the expression in brain tissues of pde9a, and also other pdes, has been studied  <cit> . bay 73â€“ <dig>  a potent and selective pde9a inhibitor, is currently under preclinical development for the treatment of alzheimer's disease  <cit> .

at least  <dig> different human pde9a mrna transcripts have been so far identified by est analysis and sequencing of pcr amplification of cdnas from different tissues, which are produced as a result of alternative splicing of 5' exons  <cit> . however, based on 5'race  <cit>  and est studies, there is only one alternative splice variant  that is present in mouse and rat. this result may indicate an important difference in the regulation of this gene in human and rodents at the level of splicing. these  <dig> different pde9a splice variants could present different translation start codons to produce the functional protein. this mechanism has been described previously in other pdes  but it has not yet been further studied. a complete review has been recently published summarizing the current efforts to understand the specific roles and functions of alternative splicing in metazoan  <cit> .

the cyclic nucleotide-mediated pathways are regulated by a complex signalling system involving multienzyme families of adenylyl  and guanylyl cyclases , protein kinase a  and cgmp-dependent protein kinases , and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases. one of the most important points of this signalling system is the cyclic nucleotide compartmentalization, which has been observed for camp in a number of cell types  <cit> . this can arise through the distinct intracellular localization of separate ac isoforms, the specific intracellular targeting of pde isoforms, and the binding of pka isoforms to specific anchoring proteins. for example, there are different pde <dig> isoforms which have specific intracellular targeting  <cit> , and interact with scaffolding proteins  <cit> , due to the modification of specific n-terminal regions via alternatively spliced mrnas in their 5' regions.

in this study we report the differential usage of pde9a translation start sites depending on the splice variant, allowing the synthesis of a variety of pde9a polypeptides that differ in their n-terminal regions. we also show the differential subcellular localization of certain pde9a splice variants with different start codons that may have consequences for compartmentalization of cgmp signalling.

RESULTS
different start codon usage of pde9a splice variants
pde9a has a large number of alternative splice variants that produce a number of mrnas differing in their 5' region while the 3' domain that contains the region coding for the catalytic site of the enzyme is present in all cases. during this work, a new pde9a splice variant called pde9a <dig>  has been found by rt-pcr from human colon mrna, which adds to the  <dig> splice variants previously described  <cit> . the sequence analysis of the predicted proteins indicated that if the open reading frame has to include, in phase, the pde9a catalytic domain sequence in all the variants, a number of the different possible start codons  could be used, depending on the splice variant  <cit> . according to the predicted sequence on the pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig> splice variants , the first start codon in exon  <dig> is in phase with the complete orf which has the catalytic domain. using this atg, other splice variants like pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig> give two short proteins  due to early stop codons found in their orf . however, there is a second atg  <dig> bases downstream from the first one, also located on exon  <dig>  in a shifted reading frame, which could be the start codon in pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig>  resulting in slightly shorter pde9a proteins but having a complete catalytic domain. figure 1b shows the schematic amino terminal representation of these splice variants. therefore, this situation might lead either to the use of the first atg, giving rise to a truncated protein, or to the use of a different downstream atg that would produce a protein with a different n-terminus but that would include the catalytic domain. these four splice variants represent most of the pde9a splice variants and would help us to clarify the usage of the different start codon in those transcripts.

in order to test these possibilities, cdnas corresponding to the pde9a <dig>  pde9a <dig>  pde9a <dig>  and pde9a <dig> splice variants were cloned in the pegfp-n <dig> expression vector to create fusion proteins between the predicted orf of the specific pde9a isoform and that of egfp fluorescent protein, and then they were transiently expressed in both cos- <dig> and hela cells. the cdnas were cloned with  <dig> nucleotides of the 5'-untranslated region  of pde9a <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides of the 5'utr of pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig>  . this region was obtained by 5' race on the longest cdnas cloned  <cit> . these clones express the pde9a splice variant followed by a gfp fluorescent protein in the c-terminal of the chimeric protein. all constructs were sequenced and the gfp sequence was, in all cases, in phase with the pde9a catalytic domain. no changes in the sequence of the predicted pde9a or gfp protein were observed.

the expression of the four pde9a splice variants  fused to gfp were tested in transiently transfected cos- <dig> cells by immunoblotting analysis using both anti-gfp  and anti-pde9a sera . all splice variants  were detected with both antibodies and they show their predicted molecular mass , revealing that both start codons were used by the cell to produce the chimeric pde9a-gfp protein. the same results were obtained expressing these constructs in hela cells . it may then be concluded that in the different splice variants of pde9a, a variety of polypeptides with different n-terminal sequences but containing the catalytic domain are produced by the use of two different start codons present in exon  <dig> 

observing the mrna initial sequence of pde9a, a previously described hairpin structure  <cit>  could be seen , which could be the responsible element of a post-transcriptional regulation of pde9a splice variants. there are some examples of proteins whose translation is affected by 5'utr hairpin, such as ornithine decarboxylase translation inhibition, which is regulated together by its 5'utr and enzymatic products  <cit> . having a close look around exon  <dig> start codons sequence context and comparing them with kozak consensus sequence  we could see that the first start codon presents an optimal context for initiation of translation in mammals at sequence level, which could be affected by the secondary structure of the mrna. on the other hand, the second start codon presents a weak or suboptimal context due to the pyrimidine on - <dig> position, but it might probably not be influenced by the inhibitory effect of the hairpin located upstream.

the different start codon usage in exon  <dig> reported here allows the differential translation of protein domains like the n-myristoylation motif present in the protein sequence region. a similar situation may be supposed to occur with the expression of splice variants of other pdes such as pde8a <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> splice variants  <cit> , human pde4d splice variants  <cit> , and rat pde7b <dig> splice variant  <cit>  therefore producing a variety of proteins that differ in their n-terminus. recent findings also show an increasing number of genes  with ires elements  that regulate their translation by a balance between the cap-dependent and ires-mediated expression to produce several proteins .

intracellular location of pde9a splice variants in transfected hela and cos- <dig> cells
in a number of other pde proteins it was found that the protein structure contains a phosphodiesterase catalytic domain in the c-terminus of the protein, and several different regions in the n-terminus produced by differential splicing of the exons. this situation provided a large number of different proteins which properties differ in the regulation of catalytic activity. they may include a cleavage site for caspase activities   <cit> , a site for protein-protein interactions   <cit> , or consensus sequences for subcellular targeting   <cit> .

laser scanning confocal microscopy has been employed to define the intracellular localization of the proteins produced by the pde9a <dig>  pde9a <dig>  pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig> splice variants. for this analysis, cdnas corresponding to the different splice variants were transiently transfected in hela and cos- <dig> cells with the gfp protein fused in the carboxy terminal region, and with the cfp protein fused in both the carboxy and amino terminal region of the predicted proteins, obtaining very similar results. the strategy chosen for the study has been to express the different pde9a polypeptides in cultured cells. expressing tagged-proteins in cases where no useful antibodies are available may be the only way to detect the location of the proteins within the cell, and fusing the tag in both the carboxy and amino terminal region maximize the reliability of this approximation.

this study revealed that pde9a <dig> is predominantly localized in the membrane ruffles at the cell margin, but it is also directed to a discrete perinuclear location , golgi apparatus , intracellular vesicles, and weakly to endoplasmic reticulum . in the detailed image  the membrane and membrane ruffle association of pde9a <dig> is visible as well as the location in vesicles. however, the amino terminal pde9a <dig> construction , lacking the c-terminal region that contains the catalytic domain, was not clearly expressed in the cell margin, but was distributed throughout the cell cytosol . the carboxy terminal pde9a construction, spanning the catalytic domain and the extreme carboxy terminal region of pde9a , was also distributed all around the cytosol . a weak nuclear expression was detected in this construction, while pde9a <dig> expression was excluded from the nucleus in all cases . there was a high level of pde9a <dig> in membrane ruffles and in the perinuclear region . however, it was also present in other cell membrane regions. in vivo fluorescence microscopy of hela cells transiently transfected with pde9a1-gfp and pde9a2-gfp constructs and stained with fm4- <dig> has revealed the co-localization of pde9a-gfp chimeric proteins and the fluorescent membrane tracer . the reticular location of pde9a2-gfp chimeric protein could also be observed in these images. the pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig> splice variants, on the other hand, seem to have lost the targeting towards a cortical region having, instead, a cytosolic location  and a weak colocalization with the endoplasmic reticulum . in these cases there was a clear definition of the cell outline, which was missing from the control gfp expression .

different cellular location of the pde9a splice variants may be regulated by the n-terminus region, which is the main change in the different splice variants. the analysis of this region shows that two putative domains  for nuclear localization in pde9a are found in this region. the pat <dig> signal is present in splice variants  <dig> and  <dig> , and the bipartite signal is present in all splice variants studied . in contrast to our data, wang and colleagues  <cit>  found a pat7-dependent nuclear location or pde9a <dig>  whereas our chimeric constructions with the pat <dig> signal have never given a nuclear location. there is an n-myristoylation pattern  in the first amino acids of pde9a <dig> and pde9a <dig> , which is often related to modifications leading to a membrane attachment. the presence of pde9a <dig> in the golgi apparatus is consistent with post-translational myristoylation, which is done in this cellular compartment.

the results obtained above indicate that both the amino and carboxy terminal regions take part in the regulation of the cellular localization of pde9a, because only the complete sequence is found in the vicinity of the membrane region while a cytoplasmic location is observed for both n-terminal and c-terminal isolated regions. however, a recent structural study suggests that the n-terminal region of pde9a does not significantly participate in the regulation of pde activity  <cit> . nevertheless only the longer splice variants show the specific pattern observed. it could then be possible that the cellular localization of pde9a is regulated by differential splicing, which provides a specific combination of sequences, and post-translational modifications allowing a membrane targeting. these different types of modifications may explain the differences observed in studies that have used different cell types  <cit> . in this situation, the interaction with another protein or proteins may be important for the observed localization of the protein.

the presence of pde9a splice variants in the vicinity of the membrane and in other subcellular locations may allow the regulation of cgmp degradation in cellular microdomains, which may be in accordance with cyclic nucleotide regulation due to multiple pde proteins presence in each cell. these cellular microdomain locations, together with co-localization with other pathway signalling molecules probably contribute to both spatial and temporal regulation of specific cellular signal transduction.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that the two start codons of pde9a located on exon  <dig> could produce a variety of polypeptides with different n-terminal sequences but containing the catalytic domain. moreover, these alternative splice variants present a different subcellular distribution, allowing the regulation of cgmp degradation in cellular microdomains contributing to a fine regulation of specific signal transduction.
