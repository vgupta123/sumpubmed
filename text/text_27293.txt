BACKGROUND
the pig, sus scrofa, appeared in south east asia ~ <dig>  million years ago   <cit> , colonizing a wide range of habitats thereafter including europe and north africa. european and asian wild boars are estimated to have diverged ~ <dig>  m  <cit> . the wild boar is among the first of the domesticated livestock species, an event that occurred approximately  <dig> - <dig>  bc both in europe and in asia in independent events  <cit> . today, thanks to the intense modern breeding and selection programmes, the pig is one of the most economically important domestic species worldwide providing a relatively cheap source of dietary protein for humans. the species sus scrofa is highly variable at both the dna and phenotypic levels and there are 200- <dig> pig breeds currently recognized  <cit> . consequently, the study of pig diversity from different ecosystems and breeds including wild and domestic populations may uncover phenotype-genotype relationships of high evolutionary and adaptive physiology relevance. in particular, dietary adaptation through taste sensory mechanisms is emerging as a major evolutionary selection pressure  <cit> . taste receptors  and their genes  are known to monitor the presence of dietary compounds in the oral cavity. with the exception of the salty and sour tastes, all other candidate receptors known to date related to taste and nutrient sensing belong to the family of g-protein coupled receptors . salty and sour perceptions seem to be related to ligand gated transmembrane channels. more specifically, these channels consist of tetrameric epithelial sodium channels  for salty; and dimeric hydrogen gated channels  for sour  <cit> . both multimeric transmembrane channels are quite ubiquitous and do not seem to be specific to sensory cells, hence have not been included in this study. on the other hand, the taste system includes two main families of gpcrs. family  <dig> is related to simple sugars and some l-amino acids present in the diet . family  <dig> is part of the sensory mechanism to identify potentially toxic compounds and elicits bitter taste   <cit> . other gpcrs have been related to nutrient sensing in the oral cavity and include the sensing of amino acids and peptones , medium and long chained saturated and unsaturated fatty acids   <cit> . overall, the oral chemosensory gene repertoire can be potentially divided into those receptors identifying nutrients  which in turn would elicit a positive hedonic sensation, and receptors responding to potential undesirable substances , which in turn would trigger a repulsive response .

more precisely, the tas2r family seems to play a role of particular relevance in species evolution across mammalian species  <cit> . in a genomic analysis involving  <dig> vertebrate species  li and zhang  <cit>  found evidence that the tas2r diversity was associated with the adaptation to the presence of dietary toxins among other selective forces. in addition, genetic selection related to domestication may also be an important driver to dietary adaptations  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that the cluster of tas2rs across pig breeds from different geographical origins and/or selection pressure  will show a higher presence of polymorphisms than the non-bitter nutrient/taste sensing genes.

the genome of the duroc breed of swine was sequenced by the international swine genome sequencing consortium  and the information was made publically available in  <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig> a reviewed annotation was released which identified part of the porcine taste receptor repertoire  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  genes  are currently annotated in the sus scrofa assembly  <dig>  . however, the nutrient sensing and taste receptor gene repertoire in pigs has only been partially described  <cit>  and their diversity across the sus scrofa population remains unknown.

the objective of our study is to update the current porcine genome annotation regarding nutrient sensors or taste receptors and study their diversity. here we quantify and compare the variability in nutrient and taste receptor genes across different domestic breeds and wild boars spread around the world. given the potential role of bitter perception in environmental adaptations, we will test the hypothesis that the tas2r repertoire in pigs has a higher diversity than the non-bitter taste receptors.

RESULTS
prediction of the porcine taste and nutrient receptor gene repertoire
in order to identify the tasr repertoire in the porcine genome, we carried out blast searches using known human  and mouse  mrna sequences. we excluded putative sour and salty taste receptor genes from the analysis because of their multimeric nature, ubiquitous expression  and not being gpcrs. the genes were grouped based on nutrient sensing: sugars ; amino acids and peptones ; fatty acids ; and bitter compounds . figure  <dig> shows the homology percentage between the known tasrs and tasrs in human and mouse, respectively compared to those found to match in the pig genome. we have included  <dig> tas2rs, for which the current annotation denotes  <dig> of these to be protein coding and  <dig> to be pseudo genes . the porcine tas2r repertoire appears to differ significantly from human and mouse repertoires. for example, seven human tas2r  and three mouse tas2r  show high homology  to only a single pig bitter receptor pseudo gene, tas2r <dig>  in contrast, the pig tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> have no human orthologs.figure  <dig> 
blast results showing percent homology. shown is the percent identity between the porcine nutrient sensor and taste receptor gene  mrna sequences from the pig genome refseq database  blasted to the human  and mouse  genomes. in total there were  <dig> nutrient sensor and tasr mrna sequences identified in the pig genome as being orthologous to respective taste receptor genes in human and mouse. included are  <dig> tas1rs,  <dig> tas2rs,  <dig> fat/fatty acid genes,  <dig> amino acid genes,  <dig> calcium receptor gene and  <dig> peptone receptor gene. for those genes that had more than one blast hit , with different homology percentages, this can be seen as more than one ●/▲ on the graph corresponding to that gene. in the case where the hits had the same homology percentage, the symbols overlap.



of all the  <dig> porcine genes studied, the cluster of genes sensing amino acids showed the highest homologies to their human orthologs ranging from 90% to 93% . the peptone receptor, gpr <dig>  had 84% homology with its human ortholog. with the exception of the gpr <dig> , the fatty acid receptors and the three tas1rs showed medium to high identities between the two species ranging from 82% to 88%. finally, the lowest homologies identified between pig and human tasrs were amongst the porcine tas2r family and gpr <dig>  in addition, when comparing the pig tasr repertoire to the mouse, the gene homologies follow a similar pattern.

expression of the porcine gpcr nutrient sensor and taste receptor gene repertoire in circumvallate papillae
we determined whether the candidate porcine tasrs were transcribed into mrna in tongue circumvallate papillae using real time pcr. following standard procedures, total rna was extracted from porcine papillae and reversed transcribed into cdna before carrying out the pcr assays . figure  <dig> shows the relative in vivo gene expression levels of all the genes identified in our study as constituting the pig tasr repertoire in pig circumvallate papillae. all tasrs identified were significantly expressed, with the exception of tas2r <dig> which was not measured; due to it not satisfying our criteria of being a protein coding tas2r . the results showed that gpr <dig> and tas2r <dig> had the highest and casr the lowest relative gene expression levels. of the tas1r subfamily, tas1r <dig> is expressed significantly  higher than tas1r <dig> and tas1r <dig>  amongst the tas2r repertoire, we observed the highest expression levels for tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig>  in contrast, tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig> and tas2r <dig> were found to have a relatively low gene expression level. two of the fatty acid sensors had higher  expression levels  compared to the other three . among the group of genes with specificity to amino acid sensing, casr showed a significantly  lower abundance than the rest.figure  <dig>

species wide variant discovery
out of all  <dig> gustatory genes identified, we carried out a comprehensive variability analysis of the sequence of  <dig> genes that were present in the current porcine assembly . the seven genes excluded from the analysis were tas1r <dig>  tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig> and gpr <dig>  because they were either not annotated or annotated in contigs and not in any of the  <dig> porcine autosomes or sex chromosomes.

using high throughput sequencing data from  <dig> samples distributed worldwide , a total of  <dig>  snps were found across all  <dig> genes and 10 kb flanking regions . the average rate of transitions vs. transversions was ti/tv = <dig> , similar to the genome wide rate in pigs  <cit>  and similar to that found in other mammalian species  <cit> . a total of  <dig> snps  had been previously assigned reference snp numbers available in the single nucleotide polymorphism database . out of  <dig>  snps positioned between 5’ and 3’ utrs,  <dig>  were in introns,  <dig> in exons in the protein coding regions of the genes, and only  <dig> in utrs . among functional coding snps, one stop lost, one stop gained,  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous mutations were found. additional file  <dig> contains all snps with reference snp id number or rs id if available, reference and alternative allele, amino acid change; sift score for non-synonymous changes, and frequency of each variant, globally and by population. the  <dig>  novel snps have been reported to dbsnp .table  <dig>

details included are the chromosome, start and end position, total snps and their distribution by genomic region and functional consequence, and missing data . this analysis was performed in  <dig> pigs .


agenes excluded because of high missing rate, sy = synonymous and ns = nonsynonymous sites. *number of exons per genes.. † total length in base pairs for all genes .

the % of missing data, for every position, was computed as the number of non-callable genotypes, either because of low quality or low depth , divided by total number of samples . total missing rate was the average across positions.



we used sorting intolerant from tolerant  tool  <cit> , as implemented in ensembl variant effect predictor, to predict amino acid changes that may affect protein function of nssnps subset from dbsnp   <cit> . while these in silico tools are not always reliable, they do provide guidelines as to what snps to prioritize in follow up functional studies. out of  <dig> nssnps for the investigated tasrs, it was possible to predict tolerance index for  <dig> snps, of which  <dig>  presented a tolerance index score below  <dig> , and can therefore be considered potentially deleterious to protein function . in general, and in agreement with the potentially deleterious nature of these mutations, these alleles were rare and mostly present in a single population; they are probably recent mutations that have not been purged yet. however, a few interesting exceptions exist. for instance, nssnp rs <dig>  was at intermediate frequency in asian domestics  and is present in international and in american village pigs.

patterns of nucleotide variation
a worrying aspect of shotgun next generation sequence  data is the fact that coverage is a quasi-random process and it is therefore unlikely that all samples have enough depth and quality to be analysed. in our data, we found an average of 20% missing data rate , which makes it necessary to use methods that account for this. the missing rate was as high as 50% for two genes, casr and tas1r <dig>  and these were removed from further analyses. consequently, for the rest of the work we discuss the results relevant only to the  <dig> loci remaining.

nucleotide diversity per nucleotide and global fixation indices  were calculated using mstatpop , which provides unbiased estimates of basic population genetic statistics even at high missing rates  <cit>  . species wide, average gene variability was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  comparable to that found in the flanking regions . synonymous variability rate  was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> on average whereas non-synonymous rate  was three times lower , in agreement with most results in the literature  <cit>  and consistent with a prevailing purifying selection model.table  <dig>

among gene regions, nucleotide diversity  ranged from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in gprc6a to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in tas2r <dig>  interestingly, bitter taste genes exhibited higher nucleotide diversity on gene regions  than in intergenic regions . the opposite was observed in the remaining groups of genes, which showed greater diversity in the complete region, i.e., gene sequence plus 10 kb flanking regions . both fatty acid and amino acid receptors showed lower gene nucleotide diversity than bitter taste receptors . overall, the gene variability, especially for the bitter taste receptors, are higher than normally reported for the pig species genome wide, which are in the order of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for international pig breeds and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for iberian pigs  <cit> .table  <dig>

estimations are per kilobase and were calculated at total  and gene region  by population and gene group.

samples from tamworth, ‘manchado de jabugo’, and the two sumatran wild boars are not included.

*p <  <dig> , significance based on  <dig> permutations.



as mentioned, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous variants  was smaller than  <dig> in all genes , indicating prevalent purifying selection. some extreme cases were observed. for instance, we did not find any non-synonymous snps in gpr <dig> or any synonymous polymorphisms in tas2r <dig>  four genes  presented ω values higher than  <dig>  and smaller than  <dig>  likely due to weak purifying selection .

estimates of nucleotide diversity varied greatly between genes and between populations . asian domestic  and asian wild boar  exhibited a high within-population variability, with average value πg = <dig>  × 10- <dig>  iberian population was the least variable , whereas the american village and brazilian pigs presented the highest levels of diversity πg = <dig>  × 10- <dig> and πg = <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively which seem to reflect their admixed ancestry  <cit> . we also analyzed the nucleotide diversity by gene groups in each population . brazilian, creole and euwb population showed the highest variability for tas2rs, mainly when we analyzed only the gene regions . iberian population, in comparison to other populations, showed almost two times lower nucleotide diversity for this same gene group . therefore, except in the iberian pig where we analyzed the highly inbred strain ‘guadyerbas’  <cit> , the rest of porcine populations analyzed exhibit considerable variability in these genes.

structure and phylogeography
like most domestic species, the pig is arranged in breeds with specific phenotypic differences that are genetically isolated or with limited genetic interchange. high differentiation indices  are therefore expected in such a structured species with a wide range of distribution and many specialized breeds which prevent the gene flow between them. not unexpectedly, the global estimate of the fst over all populations per each gene was significantly different from zero, except in tas2r <dig>  tas2r <dig>  gpr <dig> and gpr <dig>  indicating a widespread population differentiation and limited gene flow between populations. by groups, the fatty acid receptors had the lowest degree of differentiation. significant fst’s ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

we used principal component analysis  and structure  <cit>  to represent breed and geographic differentiation . we applied pca at three resolution levels: using all snps, using only bitter receptor snps, and using only non-synonymous mutations in bitter receptor genes. both the pca and structure analyses  show a separation between asian and local european breeds  as is typically observed in mtdna and at the autosomal level  <cit> . remarkably, we observed a continuum rather than a clear geographic split between asia and europe. for instance, figure 3a shows the pca plot with all snps from the  <dig> genes. here, the first axis explains  <dig> % of the variance, and discriminates between asia and europe with international breeds clustering in between, but there is a continuum rather than an abrupt divide . the second axis in figure 3a accounts for  <dig> % variance and separates highly selected breeds from wild boar and non-selected local breeds . this suggests that modern selection has exerted a consistent influence across breeds on the pattern of variability in the pig. creole and brazilian pigs tend to fall within the international cluster . this pattern is exacerbated when only bitter receptor polymorphisms are considered , with some interesting changes: the first axis  now separates european wild boar and iberian from the rest, while the second axis  distinguishes asia from the rest. some international breeds such as large white are tightly clustered due to their low nucleotide diversity that was smaller than average for this gene groups , may be as a result of a selective pressure in commercial breeds on tasrs. similar results were observed when only non-synonymous snps are employed .figure  <dig> 
principal components  and structure analysis. pca performed on all snp data from all  <dig> genes considered  and for a subset different subsets: bitter  and non-synonymous snps for bitter . structure analyses with full set of snps  and non-synonymous snps from bitter taste receptors . each individual is represented by one vertical line with the proportion of assignment to each cluster shown on the top and the different colours are referent to different clusters: international  = blue; asian  = green; and european  = red. breed and population codes are as in table  <dig> 



the structure analyses of snp data from bitter taste receptors suggested that the optimal values of genetic clusters k were  <dig> for non-synonymous snp and  <dig> to  <dig> for the full set of snp . for k = <dig>  figure 3d and e show a clear separation between asian , european  and international  breeds. nonetheless, there was a large heterogeneity among individuals within each breed, as is also evident from the pca graphs. in the brazilian population , the piau breed was assigned to the international cluster with 100% probability, whereas monteiro and moura present an admixed fraction of genome from asian and european origins. within euwb, three individuals from the netherlands and france  were predicted to hold a high international breed component value . this could be due either to introgression of international breeds into wild boar or to a lack of differentiation between euwb and international pigs for these genes. in principle, the introgression hypothesis seems a plausible one, given that admixture events between euwb and domestics have been repeatedly documented  <cit> .

for both set of snps the iberian population was assigned to a cluster of its own, and only one individual had approximately 3% of its genome composition assigned to the international  cluster. this means that the iberian population is highly homogeneous, presumably because the individuals studied belong to a highly inbred herd.

discussion
our data defines for the first time the full gpcr nutrient and taste receptor gene repertoire in the pig using human and mouse gene sequence homology analysis and a comprehensive survey of its worldwide variability using shotgun sequence data from  <dig> pigs. however, it should be noted that current porcine assembly  <dig>  and its annotation are still incomplete, where about 8% of genome is estimated to be missing  <cit> ; further there is a high missing rate in the ngs data as well . in addition, novel nutrient sensing genes might be identified in the future. thus, future studies may be able to uncover a potential hidden fraction of tr and additional tr variability. within the tasr repertoire, two main categories have been outlined: those receptors that sense nutrients , also referred here as non-bitter trs ; and those receptors that sense primarily non-nutritional or potentially toxic compounds known as bitter taste receptors . admittedly, there is a wide range of non-toxic potential bitter tr ligands including amino acids, peptides or polyphenols amongst many others, but a more detailed discussion on that is outside the scope of the current paper.

our results from porcine tongue mrna abundance confirm that the large majority of the genes studied are expressed. the samples were collected by specifically targeting the taste papilla, however, small portions of surrounding structures and cell types , may have also been harvested. consequently, it is possible  that the results of the gene transcripts are not related to taste sensory cells. the relative gene expression levels were found to differ significantly  amongst genes. tas1r <dig>  tas2r <dig> and gpr <dig> showed the highest whilst tas2r <dig> and casr were amongst the lowest expression levels. within the tas1rs, the high relative expression level of tas1r <dig> compared to the other  <dig> genes supports previous findings that this gene encodes one part of a dimer for both sweet  and umami  taste receptors  <cit> . the heterodimeric porcine umami receptor  was the first porcine tr to be sequenced, cloned and fully characterized . in agreement with previous reports our data supports the view that pig tas1rs and mglur <dig> have a high homology with the human orthologs  <cit> . furthermore, the homology of the porcine tas2r <dig> to the human tas2r <dig> and to the mouse tas2r <dig> has also previously been reported  <cit> .

other published work on porcine tasr expression have been related to the presence of the receptor proteins t1r <dig> and t1r <dig> in the small intestine  <cit> , the presence of the amino acid/peptone receptors gprc6a, gpr <dig> and casr in gastric antrum  <cit>  and seven tas2rs found to be expressed in five sites of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, these is the first systematic study on porcine tasr expression related to the oral cavity  which includes an updated pig taste and nutrient gpcr receptor repertoire. we completed a detailed investigation of the annotation of all the tasrs resulting in the identification of several incorrect intron-exon boundaries and open reading frames in the current porcine annotation for  <dig> genes. a correct gff file with the correct annotation is provided in as additional file  <dig>  all non-bitter tasrs found in the pig genome were annotated as complete functional genes, with the exception of gpr <dig>  this gene has a discrepancy in its annotation as ncbi denotes it to be a validated protein coding gene, whereas ensembl classifies it as a pseudo gene. our data showing relatively high expression level of this gene seems to further support the ncbi annotation. in contrast, four of the porcine tas2rs were annotated as pseudo genes.

mammalian diversity in tasrs has been related to dietary adaptations  <cit> . consequently, it is tempting to speculate that the differences in tasr homologies, particularly related to fatty acid and amino acid sensing, between humans and pigs might be related to diet. the amino acid and peptone receptors showed the highest homologies between pigs and humans  which presumably highlights the nutritional relevance of dietary protein across species. dietary energy is the other macronutrient essential for life and is mainly related to fats and sugars. in our study, the tasrs for simple carbohydrates  and fatty acids  except gpr <dig> also resulted in high homologies between the pig, humans and mice. both humans and pigs are omnivorous species. however, pigs in the wild are foraging animals with a diet consisting roughly 90% of plant-derived foods primarily fruits, roots, leaves and grasses. the relative amount of dietary protein and fats from animal tissues is usually well below 10%  <cit>  which accounts for an important difference relative to humans who have evolved on dietary habits containing  <dig> to 80% of animal-derived foods  <cit> . a higher reliance on plant-derived foods might, in turn, be related to a higher olfactory acuity of pigs compared to humans and other mammals. to date, pigs have the largest of the olfactory gene repertoire of all studied mammalian species. it might be speculated that the lower number of tas2rs in pigs compared to humans is related to a higher dependency on olfaction. however, the porcine non-bitter  tasr repertoire is very similar in number of genes and sequence homology to the human system. in addition, the lower number of porcine tas2rs compared to humans, may not imply a decreased sensitivity to dietary bitter compounds since some of the additional human t2r seem to be narrowly tuned and may not even be related to food volatiles  <cit> . overall it seems that pigs have a similar gustatory capacity when compared to humans.

our results show that the highest degree of divergence between pigs and humans is related to the tas2r repertoire. humans have  <dig> functional tas2rs while our study shows that pigs have only  <dig> of which  <dig> have been annotated as pseudo genes . of the  <dig> known human tas2rs, tas2r <dig> had no porcine gene ortholog and seven of the human tas2rs had high homology with the porcine tas2r <dig>  the tas2r <dig> is currently annotated in ncbi as a pseudo gene; however, we have several reasons in support of this gene being protein coding. we observed that the porcine tas2r <dig> shares high homologies of up to 77% with the human orthologs . in addition, when translating the mrna sequence, we predict  <dig> amino acids as well as  <dig> conserved transmembrane domains, both attributes consistent with all the other porcine tas2rs. furthermore, we have found the gene expression level for tas2r <dig> in pig tongue to be similar to other pig tas2rs. finally, looking across mammalian species, tas2r <dig> is annotated as a protein coding gene in humans , chimpanzee , mouse , hedgehog  and shrew , to name but a few. we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that the currently annotated tas2r <dig> is in fact a pseudo gene which would indicate that the tas2r <dig> we have found expressed is currently not annotated.

in contrast, we could not find a human ortholog for porcine tas2r <dig> or tas2r <dig>  our results show also significant divergence between pigs and mouse such that there was no mouse ortholog for porcine gpr <dig>  in addition, of the  <dig> known mouse tas2rs,  <dig> had no porcine orthologs. our findings outlining the bitter taste receptor repertoire in the pig are consistent with a previous report by groenen et al.  <cit> , with the exception of  <dig> genes; since we have excluded tas2r7a and tas2r7b and tas2r <dig>  the gene id entries in ncbi for tas2r7a and tas2r7b have been discontinued and tas2r7c has been re-annotated as tas2r <dig>  on the other hand, there is an inconsistency in the annotation of the porcine tas2r <dig> between ncbi and ensembl. in ncbi, the gene appears shorter than the rest of the protein coding porcine tas2rs while ensembl denotes  <dig> exons, a feature not related to tas2rs. in addition, tas2r <dig> was annotated in a contig and not in any of the porcine chromosomes. however, differences in the tas2r <dig> sequences between commercial and local pig breeds have been recently reported which should warrant further research  <cit> .

t2rs are involved in detecting potential toxic compounds, consequently a high plasticity at the gene sequence level suggests a role in the adaptation to different ecosystems and feeding regimes  <cit> . different t2rs respond to different types of bitter tastants and with different ranges  <cit> . therefore it is reasonable to envisage that changes in the types and amounts of bitter compounds encountered in a specific environment may elicit specific selection pressures on tas2rs. recent evidence has shown a dynamic eco-evolutionary process between the bitter taste system and dietary diversity across vertebrates  <cit> , particularly mammalian species  <cit> . li and zhang  <dig>  <cit>  showed that the number of genes of the bitter taste system is species dependent and correlates with the relative amount of plant-derived foods usually present in their diet since most potentially toxic compounds are found in plant tissues. consequently, it might be inferred that dietary toxins play an important selection driver shaping between-species tas2r diversity. our pig population genomic analysis showed that tas2rs exhibited higher nucleotide diversity than both fatty acid and amino acid receptors . in addition, this gene variability is higher than the normally reported for the pig species genome wide. these findings provide additional evidence of the potential role of the bitter taste system in the adaptation, possibly through balancing selection, to various ecological niches in agreement with recent findings related to mammalian species  <cit> .

in general, the high average nucleotide diversity in gene regions compared to intergenic regions for tas2rs was in contrast to the remaining groups of genes, which showed the opposite effect. the incidence and location of the non-synonymous snps across the  <dig> porcine tas2rs occur with the same frequency in both the transmembrane and non-transmembrane domains indicating that there has been no selection signature for having mutations in predicted ligand binding domains. among non-synonymous variants, the most potentially deleterious ones, according to the sift score, were in general at low frequency . an interesting exception was that of nssnp rs <dig> , with intermediate frequency in asian domestics and segregating in international breeds as well. the high frequency in asian domestics but absence in asian wild boars suggest that this mutation appeared after domestication and that quickly raised in frequency afterwards, may be because its potentially deleterious consequences were offset by other advantages and was positively selected. further functional studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. using homology analysis with the tas1r <dig> human sequence, the pig snp rs <dig> is predicted to be located in the first transmembrane helical domain. the polymorphism is unlikely to affect ligand binding because the ligand binding domain in tas1r <dig> is located in the extracellular n-terminus  <cit> . furthermore, the amino acid change l- > v is unlikely to have significant consequences  as both aa are non-polar, i.e. hydrophobic.

the asian and european wild boars diverged ca.  <dig>  m  <cit> . this long evolutionary distance results in two highly differentiated clusters when both asian and european pigs are investigated using, e.g., high density snp arrays or mitochondrial phylogeny  <cit> . it is therefore noteworthy that tasr phylogeography departs significantly from the genome wide autosomal pattern and, for these taste receptors, the extreme autosomal asia – europe divergence is highly attenuated . a potential explanation for lack of divergence between europe and asia would be the well-known introgression of chinese pigs into european domestics that occurred as of the 17th century onwards, followed by selection of chinese haplotypes. although this has been observed in some genes  <cit> , it is unlikely to be the  reason for the pattern observed since a high variability is found across all populations, including european wild boar. nevertheless, asian introgression cannot be excluded. to study this issue better, we carried out a pca and computed neighbor-joining  trees for each individual gene . interestingly, for the most differentiated gene, tas2r <dig> , the nj tree  does suggest the presence of introgression in large white and hampshire, as well as in some creole pigs,

assuming that the genome wide pattern is primarily the result of drift, a less than expected differentiation might be explained by some sort of balancing selection at the tr genes. balancing selection could also explain that variability is higher than genome wide and that remains approximately constant within the tasrs and the flanking regions . a higher than expected variability could be an artifact due to the presence of copy number variants  however, this is unlikely in this case since we did not find any overlap between tasr positions and cnv coordinates reported in the pig genome  <cit> . in contrast, purifying selection seems also to have played a role in shaping tasr diversity, given the prevalence of ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide diversity  smaller than one . these results do not seem to agree, in part, with groenen et al.  <cit> , who found four taste receptor genes  under positive selection . however fewer samples were used in the previous study compared to the current data set, which includes creole, brazilian and local iberian pigs. to verify this result, we also computed other tests for detection of positive selection , but none of them were significant , suggesting weak or no positive selection pressure.

genome wide analyses have shown a higher nucleotide diversity in asia than in europe, as expected due to the bottleneck experienced by european wild boars when migrating out of asia  <cit> . in asia, a reduced diversity in domestics vs. wild boars was also observed by bosse et al.  <cit>  and groenen et al.  <cit> . interestingly, this reduction in diversity was not observed for taste receptors neither when comparing asian vs. european wild boars, nor between asian domestics and wild boars . the only population with a marked reduction in diversity was the iberian breed, and it should be mentioned that the strain sequenced here pertains to a closed population  maintained genetically isolated since  <dig>  <cit> . as argued by esteve-codina et al.  <cit> , inbreeding due to confinement explains most of loss in variability in this strain, whereas the whole of iberian strains hold a variability comparable to that found today in european wild boar. the most variable populations were american village pigs ; this apparently surprising finding can be explained by their admixed nature, as these pigs are the result of crossing with many different origins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we are defining a full gpcr-based nutrient and taste receptor gene repertoire in the pig and a comprehensive analysis of its worldwide variability using shotgun sequence data from  <dig> domestic and wild pigs of  <dig> different breeds. the porcine tasr repertoire in our study consists of  <dig> genes of which  <dig> have been identified as bitter taste receptor genes  of which  <dig> were pseudo genes. our findings on tasrs improve the most recent annotation of the pig genome . in addition, all the researched genes  were found to be expressed at different levels in pig’s tongue circumvallate papillae. our pig population genomic analysis showed that bitter taste genes had higher nucleotide diversity than either fatty acid or amino acid receptors. the cluster of genes related to bitter taste  showed the lowest degree of homology with the human repertoire together with the highest nucleotide diversity when compared to the fatty acid and amino acid receptors. these findings are interpreted as evidence of a dynamic eco-evolutionary process between the bitter taste system and dietary adaptation particularly to plant compounds. interestingly, we also found a much less marked divergence between asian and european haplotypes than found with genome wide markers; that, together with the high variability, may be indicative of a balancing selection at these loci, in particular for bitter taste receptors.
