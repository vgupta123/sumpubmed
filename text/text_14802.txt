BACKGROUND
developmental gene expression entails waves of coordinated transcriptional activation and repression events, which are orchestrated at least in part by the epigenome , a layer of reversible post-translational modifications on chromatin  <cit> . these studies invariably indicate that the epigenome is dynamic and that epigenetic modifications are linked to changes in gene expression in a concordant or sometimes seemingly non-concordant manner. however, some features of the epigenome appear to be more static than others: subsets of histone post-translational modifications  form combinatorial associations that are relatively stable and hence can be used to functionally annotate genomic elements  <cit> .

several stem or progenitor cell-based differentiation models have been used to assess the temporal changes in epigenetic states across the genome . a system which has remained under-studied relative to its societal importance is the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes. regulation of the balance between maintenance of a pool of adipocyte progenitors and their differentiation into adipocytes is essential for adipose tissue homeostasis  <cit> . adipogenic differentiation is driven by activation of genes encoding transcription factors that synergistically up-regulate target genes involved in adipocyte formation and lipid metabolism , and by chromatin remodeling notably at regulatory elements essential for transcription factor binding  <cit> . genome-wide profiling of hptms by chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing  during mouse and human in vitro adipogenic differentiation has led to the identification of thousands of putative adipogenic-specific promoters and enhancers  <cit> . the current data portray a dynamic view of enrichment in individual hptms  <cit> ; however insights on the temporal transitions in combinatorial associations of hptms during adipogenic differentiation have been missing, leaving out a key aspect of developmental gene regulation.

a deeper appreciation of the complexity of chromatin signatures can be obtained through bayesian methods which model combinatorial associations of chromatin marks  <cit> . among these, hidden markov modeling  uses machine learning to discover chromatin states from recurrent combinations of histone modifications, transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors  <cit> . from the analysis of a panel of factors in several unrelated cell types , hmm provides the ability to distinguish functional genomic elements, generating genome-wide profiles of chromatin ‘activity’  <cit> . however, the experimental material used in these studies was not chosen to infer a temporal dynamics of chromatin states; thus developmental transitions in chromatin states in a genome-wide context have not been fully explored.

to palliate this gap, a variation of hmm has been proposed as an unsupervised hierarchical model enabling correlations between gene expression patterns and clusters of combinatorial chromatin marks  <cit> . this model supports the tissue- and cell type-specificity of enhancer activity and associated histone modifications  <cit> , and concurs with recent evidence for distinct mechanisms of gene expression regulation along the genome  <cit> .

here, we applied chromhmm, a high-throughput pipeline based on a multivariate hmm  <cit> , using chip-seq data for seven chromatin marks  <cit> , in combination with rna-sequencing , to discover interrelationships between chromatin states and gene expression patterns during differentiation of human pre-adipocytes. we identify several coordinated gene expression modules and learned a 15-state model which we use to map and quantify temporal transitions in chromatin states across these expression modules. we reveal the importance of gene expression level in generating diversity in chromatin signatures and the hyper-dynamic nature of ‘bivalent’ promoter states during lineage-specific differentiation.

RESULTS
coordinated gene expression modules characterize adipogenic differentiation
we used deep paired-end rna-seq to unveil transcriptomic changes at four time points of adipogenic differentiation of human preadipocytes. numbers of reads per time point ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> million, of which numbers of paired alignments were > <dig> to >  <dig> million . we analyzed cells two days before adipogenic induction , immediately prior to adipogenic induction  and on d <dig> and d <dig> of differentiation. principal component analysis shows that the first two components segregate the transcriptome of proliferating and confluent ascs from that of adipogenic-stimulated cells , reflecting a major transcriptional switch. this conversion is manifested by the greatest differences both in the numbers of differentially expressed genes  and in the magnitude of differential expression levels . culturing ascs to confluency remarkably reduces the overall variability in transcript levels detected in proliferating cells , consistent with greater individual variations in gene expression patterns in unsynchronized cell populations  <cit> . this reduced variability is maintained after adipogenic induction , consistent with the establishment of a coordinated gene expression program. of note, this does not preclude potentially persistent cell-to-cell variations in transcriptional response to the differentiation stimulus in the populations analyzed  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the transition from cell proliferation to confluency  is characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in extracellular matrix reorganization, regulation of proliferation, development and signaling, and down-regulation of genes important for cytoskeletal reorganization and signaling functions , in line with the acquisition of a cell cycle arrest phenotype. adipogenic stimulation  up-regulates metabolic genes key for adipocyte development including lipid synthesis, metabolism and homeostasis . we importantly confirm expression and up-regulation of positive regulators of pparγ , a key regulator of adipogenesis  <cit>  , including krüppel-like factors , stat proteins , sterol-response element binding protein 1c  and ccaat/enhancer-binding proteins . conversely, negative regulators of pparγ  are down-regulated . our rna-seq data thus identify massive transcriptional changes leading to the activation of key metabolic genes required for adipocyte formation and function.

to provide a dynamic assessment of transcriptional changes during differentiation, we identified by hierarchical clustering  <dig> cohorts of genes displaying unique expression profiles throughout differentiation . we identify cohorts of genes with stable expression levels  which regroup 81% of all expressed genes. the remaining genes partition into  <dig> clusters showing sequential transcriptional induction  on d <dig>  d <dig> or d <dig> , up-regulation of already expressed genes , sequential transcriptional down-regulation , and transient up- or down-regulation . genes sequentially activated or repressed  or transiently activated or inactivated  are involved in signaling and transcription regulation processes important for adipogenic and lipid metabolism functions encoded by cluster  <dig> . our rna-seq and clustering data reveal therefore the establishment of coherent gene expression modules characterizing the adipogenic differentiation program. our datasets also constitute a high-depth transcriptome resource mapping the adipogenic process in human primary preadipocytes.

spatial relationships between chromatin states reveal restricted state transition choices along the genome
we sought to identify a relationship between temporal gene expression changes and enrichment in combinations of chromatin marks during adipogenic differentiation. we used chromhmm  <cit>  to learn a  <dig> chromatin state  model from recurrent combinations, in consecutive 200-base pair  bins, of seven chromatin marks  profiled by chip-seq  <cit>  in preadipocytes on d- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of differentiation . our model balances information level, interpretability and resolution. we annotated the  <dig> states into functional genomic elements including active and inactive enhancers, enhancer location , active, inactive and ‘bivalent’ promoters and transcribed gene bodies . chromhmm also generates transition parameters based on spatial relationships between adjacent genomic segments, representing the sequence of states across the genome . these parameters show that one state is most commonly followed by the same state or by one other state rather than by many states . for instance, cs <dig>  and cs <dig> , or cs <dig>  and cs <dig> , frequently follow each other, suggesting embedding of active or inactive enhancers within promoter regions. state  <dig> can also be followed by ‘blank’ state  <dig>  revealing enhancer sites also within chromatin deserts .figure  <dig>

we find that genome coverage and length of states vary considerably, from  <dig> bp  to tens of kilobases . this agrees with the genomic nature of histone modifications defining these states, which mark spatially restricted elements  or wider areas such as h3k27me <dig> domains  or entire h3k36me3-marked coding regions  . our model also enables to estimate that ~16% of the genome contains at least one of the marks examined . this is in line with recent data from man  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  and drosophila
 <cit> , which based on the marks examined and analysis methods concur in that most of the genome is in a ‘blank’ state. logically, state  <dig> is the broadest  and essentially deprived of genes . the spatial relationship between chromatin states learned in our hmm demonstrates a limited choice in the the transition from one state to another along the genome, which reflects a higher order chromatin layout. the data also reveal the existence of chromatin state ‘variants’ learned from non-canonical genomic elements, such as canonical enhancer sites  within promoter elements or active gene bodies.

analyzing the load and temporal dynamics of chromatin states
we next established relationships between chromatin state enrichment level or state dynamics in the course of differentiation, and gene expression outputs. we computed, for each expression cluster, the ratios of genes  harboring any given state at a given time point. the output was normalized chromatin state heat maps linked to genes at each time point . we also determined time points at which gene ratios significantly differ from the previous or following time point . since a difference in gene ratios for any given state between two time points represents a gain or loss of that state for these genes, the maps in effect show the levels of enrichment of genes in a given chromatin state at each time point, and significant changes in chromatin state between time points. normalization of gene ratios, i.e. chromatin state enrichment levels, within expression clusters allows chromatin state maps to be compared between clusters.figure  <dig>

strong gene expression is associated with high chromatin signature complexity
we first examined the relationship between gene expression patterns and global chromatin state enrichment level . from the expression cluster-based chromatin state maps, we computed a statistics matrix of significant differences in global chromatin state enrichment between expression clusters . to this end, we averaged all gene ratios within each cluster for all states  and compared ratios between clusters. we find that strongly expressed genes  display greater chromatin state enrichment than weakly expressed genes  . this is exemplified for individual genes: eomes, essentially not expressed in ascs or adipocytes  is marked by bank state  <dig> and the repressive states cs <dig> and cs <dig>  whereas the pro-adipogenic factor srebf <dig>  expressed at all stages , is heavily enriched in states . clusters of strongly expressed genes  also display greater state enrichment than all other clusters , which can be related to the lower expression level in the latter . linear regression analysis shows that gene expression level correlates with global enrichment of chromatin in hptms . this would be expected from the nature of the hptms examined, which for the most part characterize active chromatin domains. lastly, genes that are stably induced or repressed  or transiently up- or down-regulated  show similar chromatin state enrichment level regardless of the time point at which gene expression changes are detected . thus, gene up- or down-regulation, and timing thereof, do not affect the global chromatin state load in the gene regions implicated.

our results indicate that based on our hmm, chromatin signature complexity positively correlates with gene expression level, more so than with a switch in expression pattern such as activation or repression. this implies that timing of gene activation or repression is not determined by global epigenetic load; chromatin state enrichment is rather related to gene expression level.

temporal dynamics of chromatin states
the temporal chromatin state maps we generated enable a dynamic analysis of chromatin state enrichment in the course of differentiation. we first find that the total number of significant state alterations between differentiation time points  is greater after adipogenic induction  than during progression towards an adipogenic phenotype . this suggests that once adipogenic commitment is initiated, patterns of chromatin modifications tend to stabilize.figure  <dig>

next, we compared global chromatin state dynamics between expression clusters by calculating the p-value of differences in state enrichment levels between time points in each cluster, averaging these p-values within clusters, and comparing cluster-averaged p-values. we first find that strongly expressed genes, in addition to being heavily epigenetically marked, display highly dynamic chromatin; in other words, states are locally dynamically changing between differentiation time points . second, chromatin states at genes that are expressed and further up-regulated during differentiation  are by far the most dynamic . for instance at the pparg locus two dominant states, blank cs <dig> and weak enhancer state cs <dig>  are substituted by active enhancer states  and logically a state annotating transcribed gene bodies . third, short temporal gene activation events, detected at one time point only, are associated with the lowest state dynamics . it is notably lower than the chromatin dynamics of genes showing longer lasting changes or several up- and down-regulation events changes . these observations suggest that chromatin is less prone to remodeling when genes are only transiently induced than when a more durable change occurs; this is again consistent with transcription being associated with dynamic chromatin states.

bivalent promoter states are the most dynamic during differentiation, while weak enhancers retain their chromatin signature
analysis of significant temporal changes in individual chromatin states during differentiation reveals the dynamic nature of specific promoter states while in contrast, enhancer states are more stable. we find that, together with cs <dig> , cs <dig>  is the least dynamic: it shows the lowest frequency of change throughout clusters  and changes of least significance between time points . state  <dig> is annotated as ‘enhancer in active gene bodies’ , and reflects the variable localization of enhancers relative to the promoters they regulate  <cit> . stability of cs <dig> during adipogenesis is exemplified by the steadily expressed dnttip <dig> locus  and is evidenced for several gene expression modules . additional enhancer states marked by h3k4me <dig>  such as cs <dig>  cs <dig> and cs <dig>   <cit> , or cs <dig> and cs <dig>  are also among the temporally least dynamic . state  <dig>  an active enhancer state marked by h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac, is more dynamic than weak enhancer states : this may be explained by the connection between h3k27ac and enhancer activity, i.e. expression of the gene it regulates  <cit> . we infer from these data that enhancers retain epigenetic identity through h3k4me <dig> marking in the adipogenic lineage.figure  <dig>

in contrast to enhancer states, the ‘bivalent’ promoter state cs <dig>  is the most dynamic during differentiation . this is exemplified by the sort <dig> promoter , controlling developmental expression of sortilin- <dig>  involved in lipoprotein metabolism  <cit> . the dynamics of cs <dig> is consistent with enrichment of this apparently bivalent state on developmentally-regulated promoters in embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and in ascs , and its resolution into a h3k <dig> or k <dig> methylated state coincident with promoter activation or repression, respectively.

the temporal relationship between cs <dig> and transcript levels during differentiation is complex  and reflects both a regulatory and priming role of this state on developmental gene expression. for instance, increase in cs <dig> from d <dig> to d <dig> on genes activated on d <dig>  when cs <dig> load declines , suggests that bivalent promoters are marked early during differentiation, prior to gene activation. in contrast, cs <dig> may mark expressed genes for repression  or, consistent with a recent report  <cit> , it may target genes after transcriptional inactivation is initiated . cs <dig> load can also parallel transcript levels during differentiation . our data suggest that temporal dynamics of cs <dig> is linked to the h3k27me <dig> mark, as cs <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  promoter states deprived of h3k27me <dig>  are less dynamic than cs <dig> . the temporal dynamics of the bivalent promoter state cs <dig> identified here infers its sensitivity to fluctuating changes in response to environmental stimuli.

discussion
we report a 15-chromatin state hmm which describes temporal changes in chromatin signatures in relation to gene expression patterns throughout adipogenic differentiation of human primary ascs. identification of coherent gene expression modules and of chromatin states fitting these modules demonstrates the complexity and dynamic nature of hptm combinations during adipogenesis. these expression modules reveal distinct patterns including sustained expression, up- and down-regulation transitions, single-pulse patterns and oscillatory patterns. interestingly, single-pulse expression patterns prevail in responses to stimuli  <cit> , suggesting an adaptive response of ascs to environmental changes such as cell cycle exit and adipogenic induction. these pulses initiate a downstream cascade of expression changes with sequential offsets which may involve feed-forward loops  <cit> .

active chromatin regions display tremendous diversity in epigenetic signatures , suggestive of plasticity and amenability to remodeling. this complexity would be anticipated from the modifications examined, which mostly mark active chromatin. our findings nonetheless also show the remarkable dynamics of these states at a given locus in the cell populations analyzed. clearly, the diversity of chromatin state patterns may reflect complexity in a population of cells inasmuch as complexity within each cell in the population. support to this interpretation is lent by a recent single-cell rna-seq study of cell differentiation  <cit> . single-cell quantitative epigenetic analyses would help clarify this issue but remain currently inaccessible at the level of resolution required. gene expression may regardless play an important role in generating this chromatin diversity, perhaps by providing a chromatin template accessible for histone modifiers. the functional interplay between chromatin modifiers, hptms and transcriptional outputs has been difficult to underpin because this relationship is development- and locus-dependent  <cit> ). chromatin engineering strategies may prove useful in dissecting the effect of histone modifications on gene expression  <cit> .figure  <dig>

gene activation and inactivation is also associated with a remodeling of hptms, though not always concomitant to expression changes. both the extent of chromatin modifications and chromatin state dynamics are lower in gene regions that are transiently up- or down-regulated than in highly active domains. this suggests that temporal gene expression is under control of factors other than hptms in a pre-disposed chromatin environment  <cit> . supporting this idea, ‘stand-by’ occupancy of regulatory regions by pioneer transcription factors precedes activation of developmentally-controlled genes, conferring transcriptional competence . cooperative binding of transcription factors also plays a key role in the induction of adipogenic genes  <cit> . further, the correlation between transcription factor binding and target gene activation timing  <cit> , together with differences in transcription factor affinity  <cit> , could underlie the gene activation offsets within the adipogenic program.

our temporal hmm reveals several patterns of chromatin state changes during adipogenic differentiation .  the simplest is the formation of one or more state from a blank state, which is often detected at loci that become activated.  conversely, upon or following gene inactivation, one or more state can be lost, giving rise to a ‘blank’ state.  one state can also be substituted by another: this occurs in the form of replacement of one state by another or by insertion of a state into a larger pre-existing domain. this is illustrated by the introduction of enhancer sites within gene bodies concomitant with gene up-regulation, such as our observations on pparg.  states may also spatially shift over a limited area, leading to the perception of local replacement; this may represent a regulated mechanism or a stochastic event of functional importance for proper gene regulation  <cit> . restricted positional shifts of chromatin states are consistent with nucleosome sliding and histone replacement  events that occur on promoters and bodies of active genes .

the finding that the bivalent promoter state cs <dig> is the most dynamic during adipogenesis is surprising because promoter states tend to be conserved between cell types  <cit> . cs <dig> dynamics seems to be linked to the polycomb-associated h3k27me <dig> mark, as promoter states with no h3k <dig> methylation are significantly less prone to change. the dynamic nature of polycomb repressor complex  <dig> and of ensuing h3k <dig> trimethylation has been documented  <cit> . notably, an important caveat in the identification of a ‘bivalent’ state is that it remains unclear whether co-methylation on k <dig> and k <dig> occurs at the same locus or whether this state reflects heterogeneity in the cell populations. hmm data are compatible with both interpretations because input data into the model result from epigenomic information from not only all cells in a given population but also from all cell populations  examined  <cit> . gain of cs <dig> on developmentally-regulated genes before transcriptional activation, or conversely loss of cs <dig>  reinforces the importance of polycomb-mediated marking for proper adipogenic differentiation  <cit> .

inasmuch as promoter bivalency may precede developmental gene activation, de novo enhancer establishment by h3k4me <dig> marking emerges as a predictor of lineage-specific enhancer usage and downstream expression of the gene it regulates  <cit> . thousands of h3k4me1-marked enhancers found in undifferentiated ascs are retained through differentiation, in line with the adipogenic commitment of ascs  <cit> . in contrast, active enhancers  are more dynamic, in keeping with the cell type specificity of h3k27ac  <cit> . a functional advantage in maintaining enhancer identity within a lineage may be by favoring the formation of ‘hubs’ of signal integration and relay to efficiently remodel chromatin and activate lineage-specific gene networks  <cit> .

a remaining question is the origin of the multiple histone modifications detected on promoters and enhancers, including some known to commonly mark either element. this may reflect the embedding of enhancers in distinct domains such as promoters or transcribed exons, illustrating the variable localization of enhancer elements relative to promoters and genes they modulate  <cit> . recent evidence indicates that enhancers interact with other elements, particularly promoters, through 3-dimensional chromatin looping . future studies will be important to determine the extent to which three-dimensional conformation of the genome impacts chromatin states, their developmental transitions and gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-scale modeling of chromatin into  <dig> states in the course of adipogenic differentiation demonstrates a hyper-dynamic nature of bivalent promoter states, which underlies distinct and coherent gene expression cohorts. our results take our understanding of transitions in chromatin organization through the genome and in a developmental context to a new level, and constitute a resource enabling the assessment of possibilities to manipulate the adipogenic differentiation program.
