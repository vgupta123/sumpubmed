BACKGROUND
the distal portion of the human 4q <dig> genomic region  contains a complex arrangement of repetitive sequences and several genes including facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy  region genes  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . a polymorphic tandem array of  <dig>  kb repeats  has also been detected distally to these genes  <cit> ; the d4z <dig> unit contains an open reading frame  encoding a homeobox protein , but dux <dig> transcription has not been demonstrated  <cit> .

deletions within the subtelomeric d4z <dig> array lead to autosomal-dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy   <cit> . unaffected individuals have 11– <dig> copies of the d4z <dig> repeat on both chromosomes 4q, whereas almost all fshd patients have one chromosome 4q characterised by 1– <dig> tandem copies  <cit> . moreover, 4q <dig>  d4z <dig> repeats are methylated in the general population, whereas the contracted array is hypomethylated in fshd patients  <cit> . the property of 4qter array methylation has led to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of fshd is associated with an epigenetic mechanism. in this regard, the array contraction might cause proximal or distal changes in chromatin structure, with the consequent up-regulation of one or more 4qter genes  <cit> , and it is known that transgenic mice over-expressing the frg <dig> gene  develop a muscular dystrophy resembling human fshd.

some studies of inappropriate gene activation in the fshd region support this hypothesis  <cit> , but other papers report a similar level of 4qter gene expression in fshd patients and controls  <cit> . furthermore, recent findings indicate that fshd may share some features with nuclear envelope dystrophies  <cit> . unlike most other chromosome ends, normal and fshd 4qter alleles are preferentially localised at the nuclear rim  <cit> . it is assumed that this consistent and non-random localisation of 4qter in the periphery of human cell nuclei has some functional significance, and that fshd may be due to improper interactions with transcription factors or chromatin modifiers at the nuclear envelope  <cit> .

despite these observations, studies aimed at defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of fshd are difficult to perform because the genomic sequences involved in the disease are a complex patchwork of duplications. the d4z <dig> repeat is not restricted to chromosome 4; perfect arrays of d4z <dig> units can also be detected on chromosome 10q, and there are additional homologous sequences interspersed with beta satellites on many heterochromatic loci, such as the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes and the pericentromeric region of chromosome 1q  <cit> . moreover, a subset of 4q <dig>  sequences proximal and distal to the d4z <dig> array, including the frg <dig> and frg <dig> genes, are duplicated in the human genome  <cit> . this complex genomic scenario makes it difficult to understand the regulation of gene expression at 4q <dig> , as well as its alteration in fshd.

in order to obtain further insights into the function of the human 4qter genomic region, we studied its evolution by investigating genomic organisation, nuclear positioning, chromatin acetylation levels and gene expression in african apes. we chose the gorilla as a starting point because previous studies have indicated the presence of a chromosome-specific block of subtelomeric sequences in 4qter  <cit> , and d4z <dig> dispersion is less complex than in humans.

RESULTS
isolation and sequence characterisation of gorilla 4qter genomic clones
a gorilla genomic library was screened using a probe from a human subtelomeric block of sequences  that are located on chromosomes 1p, 8q, 15q and 19p in the human genome, but only on chromosome 4qter in gorilla and chimpanzee. a non-repetitive hybridisation probe was generated by pcr on dna from bac ac <dig> mapped to 15q <dig> , which includes subtelomeric block  <dig>  <cit>  . by this approach, six bac clones were obtained. in the human reference sequence, one or both ends of five clones  were similar within a region of approximately  <dig> kb on chromosomes 15q <dig>  and 19p <dig>   <cit>  , which proved to be a complex patchwork of fragments from different line subfamilies  . subtelomeric block  <dig> and the line block in the human reference sequence overlap for ~ <dig> kb . furthermore, one end of three clones  showed similarity with the 4q <dig>  locus, within a region of approximately  <dig> kb distal to the frg <dig> gene .

after kpni or ecori digestion and hybridisation with d4z <dig> , all of the clones showed a very similar restriction and hybridisation pattern of bands . these results strongly suggested that all of the isolated bacs carry very similar dna sequences, including an array of approximately 10– <dig> d4z <dig> repetition units, as derived from the densitometric profile of kpni-digested bac dnas.

the sequence content of the gorilla bac clones was investigated by means of orthologous pcr using primer pairs derived from the human reference sequence that defined the frg <dig> and frg <dig> promoters and marker 13e <dig> at 4q <dig> , and  <dig> kb of the line block at 15q <dig>  . all of the clones were remarkably similar insofar as they included the frg <dig> promoter, the 13e <dig> marker, and an almost complete line block of  <dig> kb . the isolated gorilla genomic clones thus showed redundancy of essentially three classes of sequences: an array of d4z <dig> repeats, a line block, and a region of non-repetitive 4q <dig>  dna between the frg <dig> gene and the 13e <dig> marker . taken together, the molecular analyses strongly suggested that the isolated genomic sectors genuinely derived from the gorilla 4q <dig>  locus.

chromosomal evolution of the 4qter region
four bac clones  were mapped by fish on gorilla metaphase chromosome spreads, and essentially detected 4qter and an interstitial location on chromosome 3p ; comparable results were obtained on chimpanzee chromosome spreads . furthermore, inter-alu sequences from bacs ch255-18c <dig> and ch255-39m <dig>  yielded a single fish signal at 4qter on african ape chromosomes , whereas both probes hybridized to 4qter and 10qter on human chromosomes .

the chromosomal distribution of d4z <dig> and the line block was derived using probes consisting of a  <dig>  kb unit  and a line fragment of ~ <dig> kb  obtained from bac ch255-39m <dig>  the line probe hybridised only the gorilla and chimpanzee 4qter region, whereas four subtelomeric regions were highlighted on human chromosomes  . conversely, the d4z <dig> repeats showed a more pronounced spread from gorilla to humans .

genomic organisation of the gorilla 4qter region
as the six gorilla bac clones were isolated from one genome equivalent and showed a very similar internal sequence organisation, we speculated that the gorilla 4qter region might consist of tandem repetitions of a stretch of dna made up of 4q <dig> -specific sequences linked to a short array of d4z <dig> and spaced by a block of line sequences. to verify this hypothesis, we carried out two-colour fish experiments using 39m12-d4z <dig> and 39m12-line probes on stretched gorilla metaphase chromosomes. as shown in figure 2a, both probes yielded multiple hybridisation spots at the 4q subtelomere, which were clearly intermingled, and similar results were also obtained using bac 39m <dig> as a probe ; conversely, the d4z <dig> and line probes gave single hybridisation signals on stretched chimpanzee chromosomes . figure 2c shows the proposed organisation of the 4qter region of human, chimpanzee and gorilla based on these results.

nuclear topology of the 4qter region in african apes
to study the impact of evolutionary genomic changes in the 4qter region on nuclear topology, we performed fish experiment using 3d-preserved fibroblast nuclei of chimpanzee and gorilla. the fish probes were gorilla bac clone 39m <dig> for the 4q subtelomere and a human chromosome  <dig> painting probe; in gorilla and chimpanzee interphase nuclei, we observed two major hybridisation signals per nucleus with bac 39m <dig> .

visual inspection of 3d image stacks from  <dig> gorilla nuclei revealed 36% of 4qter signal loci abutted to the nuclear envelope defined by the border of nuclear counterstaining . one allele in 7/ <dig> cells , and both alleles in a further seven cells , were found at the nuclear edge . in addition, 10/ <dig> nuclei showed multiple localised hybridisation signals for one allele per nucleus, which were clearly distinguishable from the double-dot bac signals in replicated loci . visual inspection of confocal image stacks from  <dig> chimpanzee nuclei identified one allele at the nuclear edge in 11/ <dig> cells  and both alleles at the nuclear edge in 4/ <dig> cells : a total of 34% of alleles . all of the bac signals were dot-shaped; there were no multiple localised hybridization signals like those seen in the gorilla nuclei.

quantitative evaluation of the radial arrangement by means of 3drrd and ads software confirmed the clearly peripheral nuclear location of the gorilla locus syntenic to human chromosome 4q <dig>  . the average relative radius  for  <dig> evaluated nuclei was  <dig> % , equivalent to an approximately  <dig> nm mean distance from the nuclear edge . furthermore, the 4q <dig>  locus was located significantly more peripherally than the chromosome  <dig> territory  . with respect to the chromosome  <dig> territory surface, the bac clone was again found very peripheral, being located on the surface, or even outside the "core" territory as defined by chromosome painting  .

as in gorilla, quantitative evaluation revealed the clearly peripheral nuclear localisation of the chimpanzee 4qter . the arr for  <dig> evaluated nuclei was  <dig> %, corresponding to a mean distance of  <dig> nm from the nuclear edge . furthermore, as in gorilla, the 4qter region was significantly more peripheral than the chromosome  <dig> territory . notably, the distribution curve obtained using 3drrd software revealed two peaks in the nuclear periphery at approximately 75% arr and 90% arr, thus indicating two distinct preferential locations for the bac signals. with respect to the chromosome  <dig> territory surface, the bac clone was preferentially located at the surface or outside the "core" territory  .

chromatin organisation and gene expression of the 4qter region in african apes and humans
by means of chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays of gorilla, chimpanzee and human lymphoblastoid cell lines, we analysed the histone h <dig> acetylation status of the 13e <dig> marker proximal to the d4z <dig> array, and the frg <dig> and frg <dig> promoters . the 13e <dig> marker and frg <dig> and frg <dig> promoters showed much less h <dig> acetylation in gorilla and chimpanzee than in human cells .

expression analysis of the frg <dig> and frg <dig> genes by means of quantitative rt-pcr confirmed the results of the chip analysis: the frg <dig> and frg <dig> genes were significantly  less expressed in gorillas and chimpanzees than in humans . however, treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a  increased both histone h <dig> acetylation, and frg <dig> and frg <dig> expression, in gorilla and chimpanzee cells to levels that were comparable with those observed in human cells . this may indicate the presence of repressive complexes in the gorilla and chimpanzee 4q subtelomere that are absent from the human orthologous region, an interpretation that is supported by the analysis of frg <dig> and frg <dig> gene expression in tsa-treated human cells .

discussion
in this study, we investigated in african apes the genomic and chromatin organisation of regions syntenic to the human chromosome 4q <dig>  harbouring the fshd locus, concentrating on the d4z <dig> array that has been previously suggested to be the pivotal sequence motif for human 4q <dig>  transcriptional regulation  <cit> . as most hominoid species show considerable trans-chromosomal duplication and spreading of d4z <dig> repeats, we analysed the gorilla species because it has only a few d4z <dig> chromosomal locations  <cit> .

genomic analysis of the gorilla locus syntenic to human chromosome 4q <dig>  revealed clear differences in organisation in comparison with humans. a basic block of short d4z <dig> arrays  and 4q <dig> -specific sequences  spaced by line is repeated at least twice in gorilla, whereas chimpanzee has a single d4z <dig> array linked to a line block, and humans show further remodelling involving the loss of the line block. the 4q subtelomere therefore underwent substantial genomic changes during evolution, and its remodelling essentially involved d4z <dig> and line sequences .

in humans, the line block is still present at the subtelomere of chromosomes 1p, 8p, 15q and 19p, which suggests that at least the first round of duplications preceded its deletion at 4q <dig> . this was a recent evolutionary event that might be mediated by the instability of subtelomeric regions, which are well known to be prone to reciprocal translocations  <cit> , whereas the dispersal of the d4z <dig> array from the 4q ancestral locus of the macaque has an older evolutionary history, as it took place in an ancestor of the orang-utan and preferentially involved acrocentric chromosomes in both chimpanzee and man  <cit> . furthermore, 1qcen, 10qcen and 10qter are human-specific sequence dispersals of d4z <dig> repeats.

although the sequence dispersal of d4z <dig> repeats during evolution preceded that of the line block, their simultaneous occurrence at gorilla and chimpanzee 4qter may explain the evolutionary remodelling of the region. both sequence types are prone to unequal homologous recombinations leading to the expansion/contraction of the 4q subtelomere, and this mechanism could account for the expansion of the d4z <dig> array and the complete loss of the line block in man.

despite the evolutionary genomic remodelling of the 4q subtelomere, both gorilla and chimpanzee lymphoblastoid cells showed very little or undetectable histone h <dig> acetylation at the 13e <dig> marker, and the frg <dig> and frg <dig> gene promoters; furthermore, this was paralleled by very low levels of frg <dig> and frg <dig> mrna expression. conversely, human lymphoblastoid cells showed higher levels of both frg <dig> and frg <dig> promoter acetylation and mrna expression.

the human cell data partially agreed with the results of previous experiments comparing histone h <dig> acetylation in lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cells from normal individuals and fshd patients, which led to the conclusion that the observed acetylation levels across the 4q <dig>  region were not like those in condensed chromatin  <cit> . therefore, the low acetylation levels in gorilla and chimpanzee cells indicate the occurrence of a more condensed chromatin structure at 4qter, and this correlates well with their very low expression of frg <dig> and frg <dig> genes.

however, the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity in african apes restored the expression of frg <dig> and frg <dig> to levels comparable with those found in human cells, and this reversibility of histone acetylation makes it possible to speculate that the 4q subtelomeric region in certain gorilla and chimpanzee cell differentiation lineages could acquire a more open chromatin structure. within the gorilla and chimpanzee locus syntenic to human chromosome 4q <dig> , line may represent candidate sequences for chromatin condensation as the silencing of gene expression has been associated with an epigenetic mechanism mediated by long and short interspersed repeats  <cit> . in this regard, line enrichment has been correlated with the spread of x chromosome inactivation  <cit> .

previous studies of normal and fshd human nuclei have shown that the 4q subtelomere is consistently localised at the nuclear periphery  <cit> . a similar analysis of 3d-preserved chimpanzee and gorilla fibroblast nuclei showed a considerable evolutionary conservation of the nuclear positioning of the chromosome  <dig> territory and 4q subtelomere. we found that, as in human fibroblast nuclei  <cit> , the chromosome  <dig> territory in chimpanzee and gorilla is located in the nuclear periphery, and the locus syntenic to human chromosome 4q <dig>  has an even more peripheral location near or at the nuclear edge. this extremely peripheral location cannot be simply explained by the current hypothesis suggesting that local gene density determines the nuclear positioning of a locus  <cit> , because the local gene density of the 4qter region  is higher than that of the entire chromosome territory .

in addition to the remarkable similarities in the spatial arrangement of the 4q subtelomere in humans and african apes, we also found some notable qualitative differences in the topology of chimpanzee and gorilla nuclei. in particular, the 4q subtelomere in chimpanzee nuclei showed two peripheral but distinctly different preferential positions, which may indicate the occurrence of 4q allelic variants  <cit> .

localization to the nuclear periphery is generally associated with gene repression  <cit> , and the condensed chromatin structure and low expression of 4qter genes in gorilla and chimpanzee are in line with this. conversely, although maintaining the preferential association of the 4q <dig>  locus with the nuclear periphery, human cells show less chromatin condensation and higher 4q <dig>  gene expression. on the basis of these data, we hypothesise that the peripheral localisation of the 4qter region is maintained independently of: a) the underlying dna sequences , b) their genomic organisation; and c) the expression of embedded genes. however, the evolutionary conservation of 4qter nuclear topology suggests that still unidentified subtelomeric dna sequences are responsible for the preferential nuclear location, or still unknown epigenomic features of the nuclear periphery play a role in the sub-localisation of 4qter in african apes and humans.

the chromatin condensation and nuclear anchoring of the 4q subtelomere in gorilla and chimpanzee probably reflect a need to repress genes actively in a lineage-dependent manner, and sequester them in a particular nuclear sub-compartment capable of maintaining the repressive state. the line-mediated heterochromatisation of the african ape 4qter region could be triggered in trans by interaction with constitutive heterochromatin-associated proteins residing at the inner nuclear membrane  <cit> .

in human cells, the genes of the fshd region could be protected from repression by the loss of the line block in association with the expansion of the d4z <dig> array and, in this regard, it has been suggested that d4z <dig> may be a barrier or insulator against heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing  <cit> . interestingly, mutations in the lamin a-type gene  that cause human diseases called "laminopathies" can also abrogate the nuclear peripheral location of the 4q subtelomere  <cit> , and so 4q <dig>  gene expression might be dictated by the interaction of chromatin and/or dna with components lining the inner nuclear membrane, such as the lamins known to recruit transcriptional regulators  <cit> . however, it is still not possible to rule out the possibility that repressive histone marks are responsible for the fine-tuning of human 4q <dig>  gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our study showed a particular genomic organisation of the gorilla locus syntenic to human chromosome 4q <dig> . during evolution, this chromosome region has undergone extensive remodelling in both chimpanzees and humans. particularly in human cells, 4q <dig>  genomic remodelling had an impact on chromatin condensation and the regulation of frg <dig> and frg <dig> gene expression, but did not influence the peripheral nuclear positioning of 4qter. these data suggest that evolutionary remodelling has probably conferred a novel functional relevance to the human 4q <dig>  locus, and reinforce the idea that most biological phenomena can be better understood if studied in an evolutionary frame.
