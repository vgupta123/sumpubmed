BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rna molecules, typically between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in length, that regulate protein-coding genes through sequence-specific binding to messenger rnas . these molecules were first implicated in caenorhabditis elegans development in the early 90s
 <cit> , and have been associated with a variety of biological processes since then
 <cit> . they are believed to have important roles in cancer aethiology and progression, and are currently being evaluated for cancer classification and prognosis
 <cit> .

in order to identify cell processes that are affected by mirnas, overexpression and inhibition of mirna genes are routinely performed for in vitro functional studies. well-established cell lines are generally used for this purpose, since they are readily available from certified sources that guarantee the genetic identity. primary cultures, on the other hand, have the advantage of not presenting genetic changes associated with the process of obtaining immortalized cell lines. it is clear, however, that experimental data will be biased by the adopted cell model and should be interpreted with caution.

head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  is a smoking-related cancer for which, despite being one of the most common malignancies worldwide, reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers are not available
 <cit> . recent studies have addressed deregulation of micrornas in the context of hnscc, suggesting that these molecules could be used to improve diagnosis and the outcome of this disease
 <cit> .

cell models are being broadly used in order to comprehend the function of specific mirnas in this disease, but there is no current information on the mirna content of these cells. due to the complexity of mirna regulatory networks, where one mirna may target multiple genes, and where a single gene might be targeted by several mirnas, mirna expression levels  of a cell line may lead to a significant bias in functional studies results. aiming to understand the mirna background of cell models used for functional studies in hnscc, we report the high-throughput sequencing analysis of the small rna transcriptome of an oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line  and of normal oral keratinocytes obtained from primary cultures. we believe that a deep understanding of the molecular background of cell models should greatly improve knowledge on mechanisms targeted by mirnas and other gene regulators.

RESULTS
mirnas expressed in the carcinoma cell line and in normal keratinocytes
we aimed to identify mirnas that are expressed in a human carcinoma cell line and in a cell type representing its normal counterpart for mirna functional studies in the context of hnscc. with this purpose we chose scc <dig>  a tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line, and normal oral keratinocytes derived from primary cultures. three small rna libraries were constructed for each cell type and sequenced on a solid sequencer. table 
 <dig> shows that, after filtering out rrna, trna and other contaminants,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of reads accounted for mirnas previously annotated in mirbase  for scc <dig> and normal keratinocytes, respectively. when we considered only reads matching mature mirnas, these numbers dropped to about 2% in both cases. three hundred and thirty one mature mirnas were identified in keratinocytes and  <dig> in scc <dig>  with  <dig> common mirnas. the complete set of detected mature mirnas for both cell types can be found in additional file
 <dig> 

figure 
 <dig> depicts the  <dig> most represented mirnas in scc <dig> and keratinocytes. these mirnas represent 72% of reads mapping mature mirnas in keratinocytes and 80% in scc <dig>  the three most expressed mirnas were common to both datasets: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been reported as hnscc biomarkers
 <cit> , but here there was no differential expression between the normal cell and the cancer cell line. noteworthy is the fact that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are involved in keratinocyte proliferation and migration
 <cit> , a common characteristic that might justify their ubiquous presence in these epithelium-derived cells. mir- <dig>  on the other hand, has not been implicated in hnscc. a few reports mention a tumor suppressor function for mir- <dig> through the regulation of apoptosis
 <cit> . we assessed the expression levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> by real-time pcr, confirming that there was no significant difference in the expression of the two mirnas between the two cell types .

together mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> may target  <dig> genes . the task of identifying mirna gene targets is an essential step for the understanding of their role in a given cellular environment. however, it is also a challenging undertaking due to the fact that mirnas are usually imperfectly complementary to the 3′utr region of their mrna targets. considering these difficulties, in order to access cellular processes targeted by the three most and commonly expressed mirnas in the cell line and the normal keratinocyte, we selected only gene targets experimentally verified, as reported by mirecords and tarbase databases. most of the  <dig> validated targets are reportedly involved in cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death . we emphasize the involvement of these mirnas in the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases , key components in cell cycle regulation and traditional targets for cancer therapy development, in the regulation of smad and of type ii receptor of tgfb , components of the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway, as well as in the regulation of notch <dig>  pi3k and pten. a recent review addresses the relationship between smad/tgfbr <dig> and notch <dig>  pten and pi3k, considered relatively new players in hnscc
 <cit> .

only seven mirnas were detected uniquely in keratinocytes, when a read count of at least ten reads was considered: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  only one mirna was uniquely expressed in scc <dig> with this cut-off: mir- <dig>  to our knowledge, no targets have been validated for these molecules up to now.

differential regulation of mirnas between the cancer cell line and normal keratinocytes
the relative abundance of mirnas was then compared between the carcinoma cell line and normal keratinocytes. among the  <dig> mirnas expressed in both cell types,  <dig> mirnas were overexpressed in keratinocytes and  <dig> in scc <dig>  when a 2-fold change in expression was considered. this result is in agreement with previous findings reporting overall lower levels of mirnas in cancer as compared to normal tissues. twenty mirnas presenting higher fold-changes are depicted in figure 
 <dig>  where blue bars correspond to mirnas mostly expressed in keratinocytes and white bars correspond to mirnas mostly expressed in the cell line. additional file
 <dig> summarizes differences in gene expression for  <dig> mirnas expressed with a 2-fold change between keratinocytes and the cell line.

from the  <dig> mirnas, we found experimentally validated targets for only  <dig> molecules – mir- <dig>  mir-125b and mir-133a up-regulated in keratinocytes and mir-196a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> up-regulated in the cell line. among these, we chose to confirm by real time pcr the deregulation of the mirnas presenting the lowest level of deregulation – mir- <dig> and mir-133a, up-regulated ~ 2-fold in keratinocytes, and of mir-196a, up-regulated ~  <dig> fold in the cell line. results between real time pcr and sequencing were consistent . these  <dig> mirnas may target  <dig> gene targets . programmed cell death-related genes were the most represented among targeted genes, mostly grouped under the go term regulation of apoptosis  . this result indicates differences in apoptosis regulation between the cancer cell line and the normal counterpart. illustrating the importance of this scenario for hnscc, p <dig>  a key tumor suppressor frequently mutated in hnscc
 <cit>  is a validated target of mir-125b
 <cit> , and this mirna has also been recently implicated in the carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas
 <cit> .

cell differentiation-related genes, grouped under go term positive regulation of cell differentiation , were also enriched in the dataset , an expected result considering intrinsic differences between a cell line and a keratinocyte derived from primary cultures, the later retaining its full capacity for cell differentiation.

top over-expressed mirnas in keratinocytes included mir- <dig>  reportedly a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer
 <cit> , mir- <dig>  a recently described mirna corresponding to the antisense strand of mir- <dig>  which is a mirna preferentially expressed in the skin, and which has been described as a tumor suppressor molecule silenced in different malignancies
 <cit> , and mir-376c, shown to induce apoptosis and described as down regulated in hnscc
 <cit> .

mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have not been previously associated with hnscc biology or epithelial differentiation, but mir- <dig> has been reported to be a tumor suppressor
 <cit>  and mir- <dig> has been shown to be down-regulated in hpv positive hnscc samples
 <cit> .

among top over-expressed mirnas in scc <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-181c have been previously associated with hnscc. mir- <dig> has been described as a marker for tumor hypoxia and a prognostic factor in hnscc
 <cit> . mir-181c, reported as up-regulated in tongue squamous cell carcinoma , was the second most up-regulated mirna in scc25
 <cit> .

taken together these results highlight important differences between a cancer cell line derived from the oral cavity, and its normal counterpart, a keratinocyte derived from a primary culture. these differences are consistent with the genetic background they represent and should be taken into consideration when cell models are chosen.

mrna expression patterns in the cell line and keratinocytes
dna microarrays were used in order to evaluate gene expression differences between keratinocytes and the cancer cell line that might support processes targeted by the differential mirna expression. even though mirnas are mostly posttranscriptional regulators and their effect on mrna abundance would be small in our cell models, we aimed to access differentially regulated biological processes and, when possible, associate these differences with mirna regulation potential. a total of  <dig> genes were over-expressed in scc <dig> when a 2-fold difference in gene expression was considered, while  <dig> were down-regulated  .

gene ontology term enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes dataset identified processes associated with cell cycle regulation  enriched when genes up-regulated in scc <dig> were considered . genes up-regulated in keratinocytes were mostly involved with epithelium development . these results are mostly in agreement with expected differences between the cell types, since up-regulation of proliferation-related processes should be a characteristic of a cancer cell line and epithelium development of a normal keratinocyte.

we then looked for gene targets for the  <dig> mirnas that possess experimentally validated targets addressed in the previous section – mir- <dig>  mir-133a and mir-125b up-regulated in keratinocytes and mir-196a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> up-regulated in the cell line – in the dataset of deregulated mrnas. a total of  <dig> targets were found among deregulated genes . however, only eight of these targets presented expression levels inversely correlated with the related mirna, an indication of regulation. although the correlation of expression levels does not confirm the regulation of targets by a mirna, nor does the lack of gene expression differences indicate that the targets are not being regulated - since regulation might not be at the gene expression level and we did not check protein levels - we chose to present only targets previously shown to be regulated at the gene expression level.

the table reports  <dig> validated gene targets presenting deregulation between scc <dig> and keratinocytes. fold-change in bold-type indicates that the fold-change is in agreement with the expression level of the regulator mirna in the cell.

identification of mirna-like molecules
for the identification of novel mirna-like molecules, all reads shorter that  <dig> nt, having more than  <dig> copies in our libraries and no match to known mirnas were tested. reads were mapped to the genome and, at each genomic locus of a read to be tested, one longer sequence covering the read was extracted for secondary structure analysis. this sequence extended  <dig> nt upstream and  <dig> nt downstream from the read and this length was established following the average length of known human precursor mirnas . a set of  <dig> sequences obtained this way was submitted to a four-step annotation procedure:  sequence similarity search with the blast program against a locally curated ncrna database;  structural search against all rfam families using infernal,  ab initio characterization using rnafold and hhmmir;  manual curation of the results . candidates that mapped to known coding regions were discarded. of the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> presented some evidence in at least one of the procedures. the results are shown in table 
 <dig>

four candidates presented good blast alignments with sequences in ncrna databases  and, of these one aligned with a ncrna classified as mirna . three candidates  presented good structural alignments to rfam families, but of these only two alignments included the corresponding original reads  and only two candidates aligned to rfam families that included mammalian sequences . all candidates but for cand <dig> and cand <dig> were predicted by hhmmir as including mirnas, however only candidates cand <dig>  cand <dig>  cand <dig>  cand <dig> and cand <dig> had the original reads included in predicted stems .

five of the thirteen candidates showed evidence of the original read mapping  in a predicted stem in the precursor sequence considered . these full sequences  were analyzed with the computational tool maturebayes for the identification of possible mature sequences. as depicted in the additional file
 <dig>  the algorithm did not find a potential functional part in the proposed precursor sequences  that contained the original read. this analysis underlines difficulties in novel mirna discovery, showing that different approaches are needed for complementarity.

comparison of results in cells with clinical samples
in order to compare mirnas expressed in cell cultures with clinical samples, small rna libraries from eight hnscc patients were constructed and sequenced, following the same procedures described for the cells . in each case we sequenced a tumor sample and surgical margins, the later representing cancer-free tissue. a pca plot illustrates global characteristics of these samples: despite heterogeneity within the two groups, the expression level of shared molecules is able to differentiate cancer from cancer-free samples . table 
 <dig> shows that similarities in mirna population, when cancer samples were compared to their cell model counterpart, varied from 46% to about 70%. since these percentages did not correlate with the sequencing coverage obtained in this study, we concluded that sequencing depth for each clinical sample was adequate.

tumor samples were compared to the cancer cell line and tumor-free samples with normal keratinocytes.

despite differences in absolute quantities, mirnas highlighted as most expressed in cells are frequently present among the most expressed mirnas in clinical samples . noteworthy is again the widespread expression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  already addressed in cells. this result corroborates the assumption that these abundant molecules are involved in processes common to epithelial cells and/or maintenance, and do not seem to be affected by the cancer phenotype.

on the other hand, the scenario describing the differential expression between cancer samples vs cancer-free tissue is more complex and not directly comparable with results obtained for cell lines. this is expected due to the complexity of the addressed tumor type. for instance, mir- <dig>  presenting the highest fold-change between the keratinocytes and the cancer cell line was over-expressed in cancer-free tissue in only four patients, while mir- <dig>  highly over-expressed in the cell line when compared to keratinocytes, was not differentially expressed in our clinical samples. in additional file
 <dig> we show the comparisons between common mirnas in cancer and cancer-free tissue and their cell counterpart.

finally, we considered the expression levels in the genomic region containing the mirna candidate proposed in this study. table 
 <dig> depicts the expression of the two reads that constitute the candidate in each clinical sample. samples  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed similar levels of expression found in cells. results suggest that the molecule might be functional and have a role in hnscc.

samples  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented expression levels similar to findings in cells.

discussion
complex regulatory networks connect genes within cellular processes. mirnas have been recently added to this scenario, constituting an additional layer in gene regulation. the involvement of mirnas in fundamental biological processes such as cell differentiation and programmed cell death, as well as their implication in innumerous human diseases, are currently known. the comprehension of their roles at a systems-level, however, is far from complete.

once a mirna is identified as a player in a pathological condition, functional studies using cell models are commonly used to address its involvement in gene regulation and consequent phenotypes. due to the complex interactions between mirnas and gene targets, the knowledge regarding the expression of mirnas in available cell models should be carefully considered before tackling mirna functional assays. additionally, the response of cell lines to different stimuli varies due to, among other issues, their particular genetic background. for squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, distinct patterns of proliferation and survival upon treatment with drugs or environmental stress have been reported in the literature
 <cit> . regulation of mirnas certainly impacts these conclusions, even though it was not addressed in the above-mentioned studies.

in this study we addressed the mirna constitution of a cancer cell line and normal oral keratinocytes, both used as models for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and its cancer-free counterpart, respectively. our results comparing the expression of mirnas expressed in both cell types corroborate literature findings. for instance, the expression of mir- <dig> was comparable in both cell types, in agreement with its description as a marker of squamous epithelia
 <cit> , and higher expression levels of mir-125b in keratinocytes corroborates recently published data implicating the loss of mir- <dig> and hnscc carcinogenesis
 <cit> . on the other hand, unexpected results such as the finding of mir- <dig> equally expressed between the cell models, a mirna commonly deregulated in cancer
 <cit> , was confirmed by differences in the expression level of this mirna found between our clinical samples.

through the relationship between mirna expression levels and the targets they could be regulating we show that important cancer hallmarks i.e. cell death and cell proliferation regulation, could be intensely affected by the expression of these molecules. on the other hand, we also demonstrate that the expression of certain mirnas, and, consequently, processes they target, might be independent of the cancer phenotype. for this result we addressed mirnas that did not show differences in expression between the cell types and their experimentally validated gene targets reported in the literature. as expected, expression levels of mirnas in clinical samples varied and did not always correlate with findings in the cell models.

we have also performed an in silico analysis to search for new mirna candidates. it is currently known that high throughput sequencing technologies allow for the discovery of novel molecules, due to their inherent sensibility and accuracy. the analysis used structural alignment against known mirna families, ab initio prediction using hhmmir and rnafold, and similarity search against a curated mirna local database. since we were sequencing small rnas, we postulated that any mirna sequenced in the process was a mature mirna, and therefore had to be part of a stem in the precursor mirna secondary structure. of the  <dig> candidates with any mirna evidence, in only five there was any evidence that the original read mapped totally or partially in a predicted stem , these will be discussed in detail. cand <dig> had only a hhmmir prediction, which partially included the original sequence in a stem, and was expressed only in keratinocytes. cand <dig> presented a good hhmmir prediction, and was expressed only in scc <dig> cells. cand <dig>  had evidence coming from a hhmmir positive prediction and an alignment against an uncharacterized small ncrna in smirnadb. cand <dig> had a positive hhmmir prediction and an alignment to a known mirna family . cand <dig> also mapped to the same rfam family , with the original read located in a predicted stem. in fact, the genomic mapping of the candidates showed that they cand <dig> and cand <dig> correspond to adjacent genomic locations . the original reads of each candidate covered both sides of the same predicted stem in the mirna family. additionally both candidates were more expressed in scc <dig> cells when compared to keratinocytes . a close investigation of the rf <dig> family in rfam shows mirnas have been characterized for  <dig> different species . finally cand <dig> had a hit against an undefined small ncrna deposited in the smirnadb database. cand <dig> also had a structural alignment to the rfam family rf <dig>  but this alignment included only  <dig> bases of the original read, and in spite of the fact that the family has been characterized in human, the alignment did not cover the whole consensus sequence.

all candidates were also submitted to the software maturebayes, which identifies mature sequences within putative precursors, but in none of the candidates the original read was considered as a mature mirna. however, in this software, the definition of the precursor sequence could significantly impact the results. our putative precursor sequences were based on the average length of precursors in humans. the extension of 100nt on both sides of the read derives from the fact that we did not have enough information to the position the read within its precursor. this may have affected the quality of the software’s predictions.

this conjunction of evidences point to the genomic region comprising candidates cand <dig> and cand <dig> as a strong candidate for a new mirna gene. other two candidates, cand <dig> and cand <dig>  also presented consistent evidence, but based only on hmmir, which is heavily dependent on the folding provided by the rnafold algorithm, and suffers from the same dependence of the putative precursor sequence as maturebayes.

the genomic region comprising the strongest candidate for a new mirna was evaluated in clinical samples. expression levels of the sequences that originated cand <dig> and cand <dig> were up-regulated in several tumor samples, when compared to cancer-free surgical margins, suggesting that this molecule might, indeed, have a role in hnscc. further experiments are necessary in order to confirm if the molecule is truly a mirna.

CONCLUSIONS
mirna content of two cell models used for hnscc cancer research was characterized by deep sequencing. several mirnas were equally expressed between a cancer cell line and keratinocytes, suggesting that the regulation of processes targeted by these molecules may be independent from the cancer phenotype. on the other hand, we provide evidences that pathways commonly deregulated in hnscc, such as apoptosis and cell differentiation, may be targeted by mirnas differentially expressed between cell types. our results also imply that the use of cell models for microrna functional studies in cancer research demands careful assessment of underlying molecular characteristics for proper data interpretation. the characterization of putative novel microrna molecules carried out here revealed one strong new mirna gene to be experimentally validated. this candidate was mostly expressed in the cancer cell line and its expression was validated in clinical samples, indicating a possible role in cancer.
