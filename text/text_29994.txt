BACKGROUND
phytophthora sojae kaufm. and gerd. is a yield limiting soil borne pathogen of soybean . this disease is most prevalent for soybean grown in poorly drained soils, and symptoms include pre- and post-emergence damping-off, root and stem rot, yellowing and wilting of lower leaves of the plants  <cit> . p. sojae is characterized as a hemi-biotrophic pathogen. p. sojae haustoria are produced during the early intracellular biotrophic stage and as the pathogen colonizes root tissues. at later stages of infection, light tan to brown symptoms develop leading to necrosis and cell death. resistance to p. sojae in soybean is conferred by both single, dominant genes, known as rps genes, that confer resistance to specific pathotypes  and partial resistance which is inherited as quantitative trait loci   <cit> . in both types of resistance, zoospores move to the roots where they encyst, germinate, and penetrate within the first six hours after inoculation   <cit> . in rps mediated resistance, the hyphae from avirulent p. sojae strains were only found in the first three cell layers. in partial resistance, hyphae colonized deeper into the cells of the root cortex. at  <dig> hai, hyphae were found in the same layers of root cells for soybean genotypes that are highly susceptible or had high levels of partial resistance  <cit> . the visible haustoria observed at  <dig> hai, and disease symptoms at  <dig> hai, suggested that the biotrophic stage of p. sojae occurred within the first  <dig> hai and the necrotrophic stage may begin approximately  <dig> hai in both partial resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> qtl have been identified in soybean genotypes resistant to p. sojae, of which  <dig> were mapped from eight separate populations from the resistant cultivar ‘conrad’  <cit> . of these  <dig> qtls, six mapped to chromosome   <dig> , five mapped to chr.  <dig> , two mapped to chr.  <dig> , and the remaining two mapped to chr.  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, the qtl on chr.  <dig> and  <dig> were not consistently detected with multiple isolates or the different field assays from these studies  <cit> . individual qtl that respond differentially to specific isolates of a pathogen and environmental conditions have also been identified in several other host-pathosystems  <cit> . in order to breed for a broad-spectrum durable host resistance, the selected qtl must be able to confer resistance to multiple isolates of a pathogen, act stably under different environment conditions, explain a large percentage of the phenotypic variation , and be confirmed in different mapping populations  <cit> . in an earlier study, one of the qtl on chr.  <dig> and two of the qtl on chr.  <dig> responded similarly following inoculation to three isolates of p. sojae and with two different disease assay methods  <cit> . these three qtl also explained a significant proportion of phenotypic variation that contributed to reduced levels of root rot and lesion size. additionally, rils with the resistant haplotypes at these qtl had significantly higher yield than rils with the susceptible haplotypes in field tests. these attributes make these qtl strong potential targets for breeding of broad-spectrum resistance in soybean against p. sojae.

to improve the efficiency of incorporating these qtl into cultivar development, identifying the key genes controlling these qtl and characterizing their functions is key  <cit> . these genes are not only the best markers for efficient breeding, but they are also important in understanding the mechanisms that contribute to the expression of partial resistance which still remained largely unknown. in the soybean-p. sojae interaction, few studies have explored the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the expression of partial resistance in conrad to p. sojae. pathogenesis-related  protein pr1a, pr <dig>  basic peroxidase and matrix metalloproteinase transcript levels were reported to be higher in conrad compared to ox 20– <dig>  3 days after inoculation   <cit> . two studies reported that preformed suberin, a component of basal resistance, was higher in whole roots of conrad compared to those of the susceptible line ox760- <dig>  <cit> . this was proposed to contribute to a 2–3 h delay in p. sojae penetration through the epidermis of conrad compared to the susceptible line. whole-genome transcription profiling of eight soybean genotypes with differential levels of partial resistance to p. sojae, were analyzed using soybean affymetrix® gene chips  <cit> . the eight soybean genotypes were examined at  <dig> and  <dig> dai, and ~ <dig>  genes had statistically significant responses to infection, with little difference in transcript levels between these two sampling time points  <cit> . the infection response of four soybean genotypes, including conrad and a susceptible cultivar sloan, was also analyzed in a time course assay at several locations surrounding lesion development with the affymetrix® gene chips  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  genes  had significant changes in transcript abundance in conrad and sloan compared to mock inoculated controls in response to p. sojae infection, and the majority of changes occurred at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dai  <cit> . under the two qtl on chr.  <dig>   <dig> % of the genes had significant infection response in conrad or sloan from this microarray analysis  <cit>  . interestingly, most of the annotated functions of the genes from these regions have been reported to be involved in host defense to plant pathogens. none of the genes in this region have an r gene-like motif based on the williams  <dig> reference genome  <cit> .

to date, only three genes have been cloned from disease resistance qtl in plants and they each encode proteins with diverse functions  <cit> , which is in accordance with the multiple hypotheses for mechanisms underlying qtl in effectively limiting pathogen colonization  <cit> . these three genes all had sequence variation between the resistance and susceptible alleles  <cit> . in this study, our hypotheses were that i) a complex network of defense-pathways is underlying each soybean qtl conferring resistance to p. sojae; ii) sequence of the genes under a qtl between resistant and susceptible genotypes are different in regions that will affect gene expression; and iii) sequence analysis will expedite the identification of potential candidate genes in soybean conferring resistance to p. sojae.

the two qtl on chr.  <dig> responded similarly across different phenotypic assays and isolates of p. sojae, and a large number of defense genes associated with these qtl had significant changes in transcript abundance in response to p. sojae infection. thus, they are prime candidates to explore the variation in gene sequence and expression patterns between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. therefore, our objectives were to: i) confirm the qtl in an advanced and larger f6: <dig> conrad × sloan population ; ii) examine the sequence variation of the genes underlying these qtl between conrad and sloan; iii) analyze the expression patterns of candidate genes representing different defense mechanisms underlying these qtl following infection by p. sojae. this research will not only address an expedited means to identify candidate genes in soybean conferring resistance to p. sojae, but also provide more polymorphic markers for further fine mapping of the qtl regions.

RESULTS
qtl confirmation in f6: <dig> population
these two qtl were identified previously in the f4: <dig> conrad × sloan population of  <dig> rils  <cit> . in tray test assays carried out in the present study, best linear unbiased predictor  values  <cit>  from root lesion lengths measured at  <dig> dai from p. sojae isolate  <dig> s. <dig>  in the conrad × sloan f6: <dig> ril population ranged from − <dig>  to  <dig>   with a normal distribution, indicating that the resistance was quantitatively inherited . the broad-sense heritability estimate for lesion length was  <dig> . conrad has high levels of partial resistance to p. sojae and sloan is moderately susceptible. both of cultivars performed consistently as checks across replicates. hereafter, conrad and sloan will be referred to as the r and s genotypes, respectively. five qtl with resistance alleles from r cultivar, two each on chr.  <dig> and  <dig> and one on chr.  <dig> , were identified, each explaining  <dig> - <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for a total of  <dig> % for interval mapping , and  <dig> - <dig> % of the phenotypic variation for a total of  <dig> % for composite interval mapping  .

the qtl presence in the six selected lines for qrt-pcr is also shown.

a qtl were presented as chromosome number, followed by the serial number if there were more than one on the same chromosome;

b markers tested in each qtl interval: markers started with ‘barc’ or ‘sat’ are from the public databases , and markers started with ‘glyma’ are the pamsa markers designed in this study;

c conrad  alleles for each marker were presented as “+” in the selected lines for qrt-pcr, while “-” referred to the sloan  alleles;

d nearest marker under each qtl interval.

the qtl 18– <dig>  19– <dig>  and 19– <dig>  which confer resistance to multiple p. sojae isolates, were first mapped in a conrad × sloan f4: <dig> population using two different phenotypic methods  <cit> . in this study, all three qtl were confirmed in the larger f6: <dig> generation, flanked by similar markers as in the f4: <dig> population. the qtl 18– <dig>  co-localized with the position of the r-gene mediated resistance to p. sojaerps <dig>  and rps <dig>   <cit> . residual function of defeated r-genes has been proposed to contribute to the expression of partial resistance in other host-pathogen systems  <cit> . however, the r genotype in this study does not have known rps genes, nor does this locus have isolate specificity to p. sojae. direct sequencing of this qtl region would be necessary to assess if r-gene-like sequences were present in r or s genotypes. in contrast to qtl 18– <dig>  there were no r gene-like sequences in williams  <dig> where the qtl 19– <dig> and 19– <dig> mapped, which indicates the mechanisms underlying these two qtl that contribute to the expression of partial resistance are likely to be different than r-gene mediated resistance. the qtl 19– <dig> and 19– <dig> spanned ~ <dig>  cm and ~ <dig>  cm, respectively, on the soybean consensus map v <dig>   <cit> . in this study, these two qtl had the log of odds likelihood lod scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  , and accounted for  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the variation in lesion length, respectively . the expression of broad-spectrum resistance to multiple isolates, consistent detection through different phenotypic assays, and detection in two generations of the same population, make the two qtl on chr.  <dig> prime targets to examine the genetic and mechanistic contributions towards the expression of partial resistance to p. sojae in soybean. these qtl regions are large and encompass many genes, thus, numerous molecular markers per locus may be required to ensure successful introgression of the critical component of the locus for full expression of resistance in cultivars.

sequence variation of genes underlying the qtl between r and s cultivars
the qtl 19– <dig> and 19– <dig> spanned ~ <dig>  mb  and  <dig>  mb , respectively, on the physical map  <cit> . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were within qtl 19– <dig> and 19– <dig>  respectively . these genes were classified into  <dig> functional categories . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> from qtl 19– <dig> and  <dig> from qtl 19– <dig> were successfully amplified in r and s genotypes with lr-pcr and sequenced with illumina ga ii, including  <dig>  kb upstream and 400 bp downstream of the gene coding regions. a total of  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified between r and s in  <dig> genes  . the ‘transcription factor’  and ‘protein modification’  functional groups had the highest percentage of genes with snps between r and s . of the  <dig> genes with significant infection response in r or s from the previous microarray studies  <cit> ,  <dig> were successfully sequenced and  <dig> snps were identified from  <dig> genes . for comparison,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with no infection response from the microarray results were sequenced and  <dig> snps were identified from  <dig> genes .

among these sequences, there was a greater number of snps in the introns and  <dig>  kb upstream regions compared to the exons and utrs . this was expected and similar to that observed in the soybean genome reported from other studies  <cit> . there was an average of  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms  per 1000 bp , which was slightly higher than the average snp frequency  in the genic and perigenic regions of soybean cultivars calculated from previous studies  <cit> . marker assays using the  <dig>  snps from the “universal soy linkage panel”, estimated an average of  <dig> snps for each pair of soybean cultivars based on pair wise comparisons of  <dig> elite cultivars  <cit> . only  <dig> of the  <dig> snps were polymorphic between the r and s genotypes, which indicated that the polymorphism between r and s was slightly lower than the average for pairs of soybean cultivars . thus, an elevated snp frequency in the genic and perigenic regions of defense-related genes may reflect the sequence differences in these regions that control the phenotypic differences in resistance between r and s.

of the total  <dig> snps between r and s,  <dig> snps located in  <dig> genes within qtl 19– <dig> occurred in r compared to both s and williams  <dig> . there were  <dig> genes that had  <dig> snps unique in r when compared to s and williams  <dig> . both s and williams  <dig> have lower levels of partial resistance than r, hence we hypothesized that these  <dig> snps, especially those in the  <dig> genes, are more likely to contribute to the expression of high levels of partial resistance. of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> were non-synonymous, located in eight genes  and potentially contribute to the differences in partial resistance by modified protein structure.

twenty-seven of  <dig> selected snps  were verified by a modified polymerase chain reaction  amplification of multiple specific alleles   <cit> . locus-specific primers could not be found for the snp in glyma19g <dig>  of which a highly homologous copy was present on chr.  <dig>  sanger sequencing of the pamsa amplicons of the second gene not confirmed by pamsa, glyma19g <dig>  identified a 22 bp deletion instead of the predicted snps at 918–939 bp upstream . this gene is predicted to encode a serine/threonine protein kinase and microarray analysis indicated a similar level of down-regulation in both r and s at  <dig> dai  <cit> .thus, the deletion in the upstream region most likely did not cause the infection response observed in both r and s in the microarray analysis.

candidate genes underlying the qtl and their expression patterns
microarray data was available for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes from qtl 19– <dig>  and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes under qtl 19– <dig>  <cit> . of these,  <dig> genes from qtl 19– <dig> and  <dig> from qtl 19– <dig> responded significantly to infection in r or s genotypes. the highest percentages of genes  with infection response were observed in the ‘signal transduction’, ‘metabolism’, ‘unknown’, and ‘transcription factor’ categories . to further differentiate the potential candidate defense genes within the qtl regions, one gene from qtl 19– <dig> and  <dig> genes from qtl 19– <dig> were examined for their expression patterns in response to p. sojae infection at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hai in r, s, and four selected rils using qrt-pcr . the genes were selected based on their annotated functions, sequence variation and differential expression patterns from microarray data between r and s. eight of the genes had microarray data with significant infection response in r, of which six genes had snps between r and s. a total of  <dig> genes in qrt-pcr assay had snps between r and s, with eight genes harboring unique sequence in r compared to both s and williams  <dig>  the presence of r and s alleles of these genes in the four rils was verified by pamsa .

during the qrt-pcr experiments, lesion symptoms were not visible until  <dig> hai, which was the same timing as symptom development reported in the microarray assays  <cit> . samples for analysis were collected at the inoculation site for the first three time points. at  <dig> hai, significantly longer lesions were observed in s and ril  <dig> in comparison to the remaining four lines ; tissue samples were collected both above the lesion margin, similar to the microarray assays  <cit> , and at the inoculation site. most changes of transcript abundance were observed at  <dig> and  <dig> hai, which was similar to the previous findings that most of the transcript abundance changes in the expression of partial resistance to p. sojae in soybean occurred  <dig> hai or later  <cit> . similar expression patterns were obtained with qrt-pcr compared to microarray data for six of the eight genes at all time points. however, glyma19g <dig> and glyma19g <dig>  had suppressed transcript levels at  <dig> hai in microarray assays  <cit> , but not in the qrt-pcr assays.

overall, sixteen of the genes analyzed with qrt-pcr had significant differences in transcript levels between r and s in either mock-inoculated samples, infected samples, or infection response . these three types of expression contrasts were also analyzed between the three lines harboring the r haplotype  and the three lines with the s haplotype  with significant differences observed for  <dig> genes . significantly different infection responses in  <dig> genes were observed between r and s, as well as between the r and s group . eight of the  <dig> genes had snps in upstream, utr, exon, intron, or downstream region. the annotated functions and differential expression patterns of these  <dig> genes suggested their potential association with the higher level of partial resistance in r compared to s.

signaling genes
five genes with annotated functions in signal transduction were found to be associated with the high level of partial resistance in r. calcineurin-like phosphatase  is a ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. it was up-regulated at  <dig> hai in the r group, which was 24 h earlier than the s group . this gene is involved in calcium-signaling, which is an important component of plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . repression of calcineurin-like proteins resulted in hypersensitivity to abscisic acid , indicating their roles as negative regulators of an aba signaling pathway  <cit> . aba was also reported to be a negative regulator of r-gene mediated resistance against p. sojae in soybean through suppression of salicylic acid -mediated defense pathways  <cit> . the results from this study indicated calcineurin-like phosphatase in the defense pathways could contribute to the high level of partial resistance in r genotype. its potential interaction with aba-signaling needs to be further explored in future studies in the soybean partial resistance to p. sojae.

map3k is part of the map kinase cascade, which is known to be one of the early signaling events in pamp-triggered immunity . the map3k-anp <dig> gene in arabidopsis was reported to suppress early auxin response but activate mpk <dig> and mpk <dig>  which are the positive regulators of plant defense in pti  <cit> . in this study, a map3k-anp1-like gene glyma19g <dig> with  <dig> snps in s compared to both r and williams  <dig>  with seven in the upstream, three in the introns, and one synonymous snp was identified. the map3k-anp1-like gene was up-regulated during infection in the r genotype at  <dig> and  <dig> hai. this gene also exhibited significantly higher transcript abundances in the r group than the s group at the inoculation sites  <dig> hai . these transcriptional results make this a candidate gene that may be involved in regulating soybean defense to p. sojae.

class iii alcohol dehydrogenase , is also known as the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase  or s–nitrosoglutathione reductase . it functions in nitric oxide  signaling, which is an important signaling pathway in regulating defense gene expression, defense hormone interplay, and oxidative stress response during plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . in arabidopsis the orthologous gene, adh <dig>  has been demonstrated to positively regulate basal resistance to pseudomonas syringae and hyaloperonospora parasitica through activating sa-mediated defense pathway  <cit> . however, another study reported that down-regulation of adh <dig> increased the basal resistance in arabidopsis to h. parasitica <cit> . in this study, an adh <dig> ortholog in soybean  had  <dig> snps in s compared to both r and williams  <dig>  in the upstream, exon , intron, 3’ utr and downstream regions. it was down-regulated at the inoculation sites  <dig> hai in the s group only . the suppression of this gene may potentially contribute to the susceptibility of soybean to p. sojae.

rapid alkalinization factor  was first identified in a search for bioactive defense peptides in tobacco, and it was reported to promote extracellular alkalinity and activate map kinases  <cit> . significantly higher levels of ralf activation were observed in the resistant variety of chickpea in comparison to the susceptible one at  <dig> hai with fusarium oxysporum <cit> . interestingly, in a study with poplar, methyl jasmonate  treatment was found to strongly suppress ralf expression  <cit> , which may indicate that the defense pathways associated with activation of ralf were different than the jasmonic acid -mediated pathway. in this study, a ralf-encoding gene  had unique sequence in r compared to both s and willams <dig> . it was up-regulated in the r group at  <dig> hai, which was 24 h earlier than the s group . these results suggest its potential association with partial resistance in r.

a transducin/wd <dig> domain-containing protein  had unique sequence in r compared to both s and williams <dig> . it was down-regulated in the s group only at the inoculation site  <dig> hai . members of this class of genes in other plant species have been reported to be up-regulated in the resistant response to pathogen infection, such as in potato against p. infestans <cit>  and in arabidopsis against colletotrichum higginsianum <cit> . the suppression of this gene in soybean may potentially contribute to the susceptibility to p. sojae.

genes involved in hormone-mediated pathways
auxin signaling and transport has been found in several other pathosystems to promote plant susceptibility to bacterial and fungal pathogens  <cit> . in arabidopsis, pti suppressed the binding of auxin-responsive tfs to the promoters of downstream genes, hence down-regulating the auxin-response pathway  <cit> . in soybean-p. sojae interactions, transcript abundance of a pin1-like auxin transport protein and an auxin-induced protein were both found to be up-regulated in s but were suppressed in r at  <dig> and  <dig> dai  <cit> . in this study, an auxin-responsive tf  was up-regulated only in the s group at the infection front  <dig> hai . at the same time, the infected samples of s group also had significantly higher transcript abundance than the r group . these results suggest the potential role of auxin may be in the susceptible response, and one of the partial resistance mechanisms in r may be the suppression of p. sojae-induced auxin-signaling.

a bhlh tf, myc <dig>  was reported to positively regulate ja response to wounding and insect attack, but negatively regulate the ja response to pathogen infection  <cit> . this gene has been proposed to be a key regulator in the crosstalk among sa-, ja-, et-, and aba-mediated signaling pathways  <cit> . a putative bhlh tf  in this study had one snp at the 251 bp upstream in r compared to both s and williams  <dig>  and the other synonymous snp in an exon. significantly higher level of up-regulation was observed with this gene in the r group at the inoculation site  <dig> and  <dig> hai , which again indicated the potential involvement of these hormone-mediated pathways in soybean partial resistance to p. sojae.

as observed in previous studies  <cit> , the disease symptoms in this study were first observed in soybean roots at  <dig> hai with p. sojae, which indicated that biotrophic stage of infection occurred at inoculation site during the first  <dig> hai, while necrotrophic stage can be seen at  <dig> hai. the genes encoding bhlh and auxin-responsive tfs, together with the calcineurin-like phosphatase encoding gene, map3k-anp1-like gene, and ralf signaling gene discussed earlier, were all induced in r group during biotrophic infection. based on the functional studies of these genes in different pathosystems combined with the analyses in this study, it indicates the potential involvement of sa-mediated pathway, accompanied by suppression of auxin-, and/or aba-mediated pathways contributing to the expression of partial resistance to p. sojae in soybean. interestingly, auxin-, aba-, or ja-signaling have each been reported to work antagonistically with sa against biotrophic pathogens, and elevated sa levels will suppress these three hormone-mediated pathways  <cit> . the cross-talk among these hormone-mediated pathways and their contribution to partial resistance in soybean against p. sojae should be a focus in future studies.

genes involved in modification of plant cell structures
modification of plant cell structures is an important aspect of plant defense response and three genes, each involved in modification of cell wall, cytoskeleton, and phloem structure, potentially contributed to the expression of partial resistance to p. sojae. glycosyl hydrolase  <dig>  hydrolyses pectin is one of the major components of plant cell walls  <cit> . many bacterial and fungal pathogens secret this enzyme to help them penetrate plant cells  <cit> . in this study, a gh28-encoding gene  had a unique sequence in r as compared to both s and williams <dig> . transcription for this gene was down-regulated at  <dig> hai in the r group, which was 24 h earlier compared to the s group  and may indicate the suppression of cell wall degradation as one of the many components in the expression of partial resistance in soybean against p. sojae.

kinesin motor is one of the cytoskeletal motors, which may participate in defense responses when a plant is challenged by environmental stresses or pathogen attacks  <cit> . a kinesin motor  in this study had a predicted premature stop codon in r, and the resulting peptide is predicted to be missing  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminus compared to both s and williams  <dig> . it had significantly lower transcript abundance in both mock-inoculated and infected samples of the r group than the s group , possibly due to the predicted truncated protein in r; however, this needs to be validated. in addition, this gene was up-regulated at the inoculation site  <dig> hai only in the r group , which may indicate the potential involvement of the r allele in soybean partial resistance against p. sojae.

plant lectins belong to a large gene family with diverse functions, one of which is the anti-microbial function in plant defense  <cit> . soybean cultivars with r-gene mediated resistance towards p. sojae were found to have two-fold more lectins in seeds than susceptible cultivars  <cit> . phloem-specific lectins are also known to be related with defined stages of phloem differentiation  <cit> , and their interaction with mesophyll plasmodesmata are known to increase the size exclusion limit of movement between cells  <cit> . in this study, a putative phloem-specific lectin pp <dig> gene  had unique sequence in r compared to both s and williams <dig> . it was up-regulated at the inoculation site at  <dig> and  <dig> hai across all the resistant and susceptible lines, however, significantly higher fold changes were observed in the r group at  <dig> hai . thus this gene may also potentially contribute to the higher level of partial resistance of soybean to p. sojae.

genes involved in ubiquitination
ubiquitination, which functions in protein modification and degradation, has been found to be an important regulator of plant defense response, such as the oxidative burst, hormone signaling, gene induction, and programmed cell death  <cit> . ubiquitin ligases are the key enzymes to select target proteins for ubiquitination. these ligases have been reported to regulate sa-, ja/et-mediated pathways and they could have either positive or negative effect on plant defense  <cit> . in this study, a putative ubiquitin-protein ligase  was activated at the inoculation site  <dig> hai in the r group only , which may indicate this gene as a positive regulator of soybean partial resistance against p. sojae.

from the  <dig> genes discussed earlier, three genes, an auxin-responsive tf, a transducin/wd <dig> domain-containing protein, and a class iii alcohol dehydrogenase, all had significant infection response in s group only. their annotated functions suggested that these responses may potentially contribute to the soybean susceptibility to p. sojae. the response of auxin-responsive tf was observed  <dig> hai at infection front, where biotrophic infection occurred; whereas the other two genes were down-regulated  <dig> hai at inoculation site, where the necrotrophic phase is in progress. distinct effector proteins have been found to be secreted by another oomycete pathogen, p. infestans, during biotrophic and necrotrophic stages of infection  <cit> . thus, secreted effectors from p. sojae may also mediate the different stages of infection, potentially targeting these three genes as well as others to suppress the defense response. further studies are needed to assess if the sequence variation of these genes contributes to the pathogen effector-target recognition process, which in turn contribute to the higher level of partial resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
it is usually difficult to demonstrate the effect of each individual gene underlying a qtl on partial resistance due to the large number of genes with minor and additive effects on the phenotypes  <cit> . in this study, we utilized sequence and expression analysis to efficiently identify candidate genes underlying the soybean qtl conferring resistance to p. sojae. two qtl were dissected by sequence and gene expression analysis between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. a list of candidate genes was identified, including those potentially involved in signal transduction, hormone-mediated defense pathways, plant cell structural modification, and ubiquitination. also, several genes from this list have been reported for their roles in pti in heterologous systems, which may indicate that basal resistance may be another component of partial resistance. these findings supported our hypothesis that defense to p. sojae may be a coordinated, multifaceted response to infection. eleven of the  <dig> genes with snps had significantly different changes in transcript abundance between the r and s genotypes in response to p. sojae infection in the qrt-pcr assay, which also supports our hypothesis that snp analysis could expedite the identification of candidate genes involved in partial resistance. in addition to transcriptional regulation examined in this study, other regulatory mechanisms, including post-transcriptional and translational regulation, could contribute to the differential partial resistance levels between r and s and represent interesting targets for future studies. whole-genome sequencing of these two cultivars may aid in the discovery of conrad-specific genes, which may contribute to partial resistance. overall, this study provides an initial list of candidate genes for further study and additional snp markers for fine mapping and marker-assisted breeding of soybean partial resistance to p. sojae.
