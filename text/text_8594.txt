BACKGROUND
because of its intense oxidative metabolism, the brain consumes a high fraction of total oxygen generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . although brain antioxidant defenses function properly during most of human life, a number of neurodegenerative processes which involve redox-active iron accumulation become evident with age  <cit> . iron is a pro-oxidant that in the reductive intracellular environment catalyses hydroxyl radical formation through the fenton reaction  <cit> . at present, the crucial components of the iron homeostasis machinery have been identified. thus, current efforts should be directed to the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cellular iron levels and antioxidant defenses. this is of primary importance for the development of strategies to ameliorate iron accumulation and oxidative damage in neurons.

in vertebrates, cellular iron levels are post-transcriptionally controlled by the activity of iron regulatory proteins , cytosolic proteins that bind to structural elements called iron-responsive elements . ires are found in the untranslated region of the mrnas of the major proteins that regulate cellular iron homeostasis: the transferrin receptor, involved in plasma-to-cell iron transport, and the iron-storage protein ferritin. irp2-/- mice are born normal but in adulthood develop a movement disorder characterized by ataxia, bradykinesia and tremor  <cit> . irp1-/- mice are normal with slight misregulation of iron metabolism in the kidney and brown fat  <cit> . thus, irp <dig> seems to dominate the physiological regulation of iron metabolism whereas irp <dig> seems to predominate in pathophysiological conditions.

iron is internalized into cells by the import transporter dmt <dig>  four dmt <dig> isoforms have been identified that differ in both the n-and the c-termini  <cit> . two of the isoforms have a 3' iron responsive element  in their mrna. additional variation is given by exons 1a and 1b in the 5' end. expression of dmt <dig> in response to iron availability follows a pattern similar to transferrin receptor  <cit> , but its control by the ire/irp system is not clear .

a new iron transporter, ireg <dig>  also known as ferroportin or mtp <dig>  was recently described  <cit> . the protein is expressed mainly in enterocytes and macrophages . in enterocytes ireg <dig> is responsible for iron efflux during the process of intestinal iron absorption, while in kupffer cells ireg <dig> mediates iron export for reutilization by the bone marrow  <cit> . the presence of both dmt <dig> and ireg <dig> has been described in neurons, glioma cells and astrocytes  <cit> . the presence of ireg <dig> in neurons opens the possibility that they may be able to down-regulate intracellular iron concentration through its expression.

in this study we examined iron homeostasis in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons. we found that iron accumulation killed a large proportion of cells, but a sub-population became resistant to iron accumulation developing an adaptative mechanism intended to decrease intracellular iron content.

RESULTS
iron accumulation and cell death
iron accumulation was determined in sh-sy5y cells grown to confluence and then cultured for two days in media containing from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm iron . total cell iron increased with increasing extracellular iron, reaching a plateau at 40– <dig> μm fe . the observed increase in cell iron was accompanied by increases in the labile iron pool . iron accumulation indeed caused loss of cell viability, with hippocampal neurons demonstrating higher sensitivity than sh-sy5y cells to iron treatment . nevertheless, a sub-population of cells survived to high iron concentrations. it was of interest to inquire into the processes underlying this adaptation, since they could help to understand iron accumulation observed in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. consequently, we characterized the components of the iron homeostasis machine during the process of iron accumulation.

ferritin and dmt <dig> regulation
ferritin, the main iron-storage protein in mammalian cells, is considered the first line of defense against iron overload. increasing iron from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm produced a robust 4-fold increase in cell ferritin content . further increases in iron induced additional increases in ferritin. at  <dig> μm extracellular iron, ferritin increased 11-fold compared to the basal  <dig>  μm iron condition. in molar base, ferritin increased more than iron. the iron to ferritin mol : mol ratio decreased from  <dig> at  <dig>  μm fe to  <dig> at  <dig> μm fe to  <dig> at  <dig> μm fe .

we further characterized iron homeostasis in sh-sy5y cells by examining the expression of the iron importer dmt <dig> . a  <dig> -fold decrease in dmt <dig> protein expression was observed when iron increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> μm. the presence of dmt <dig> even at high iron concentration explains the sustained iron uptake observed at  <dig> μm fe  <cit> . thus, dmt <dig> activity persisted even under conditions of iron accumulation that preceded cell death.

ireg <dig> expression and functionality
given that the presence of ireg <dig> in the central nervous system has been   reported , it was of interest to examine if it participates in neuronal iron homeostasis. western blot analysis revealed that sh-sy5y cells   expressed anti-ireg <dig> reactive bands of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda molecular weight . densitometric analysis revealed a 10-fold increase in the  <dig>  kda band in the  <dig>  to  <dig> mm fe range while the  <dig>  band had a minor increase . both bands were eliminated if the antibody was   incubated with the immunogenic peptide before the assay . a similar pattern was obtained with an independent anti-ireg <dig> antibody . thus, it is most likely that the  <dig>  and    <dig>  kda bands correspond to the monomer and dimer of ireg <dig>  the stability of the  <dig>  kda band was dependent of the concentration of b-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer since increasing b-mercaptoethanol produced a shift in the  <dig>  kda / <dig>  kda band ratios . it is possible that in neuronal cells ireg <dig> tends to form s-s bridged dimers resistant to the electrophoresis conditions.

the presence of ireg <dig> in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons was further documented by immunocytochemistry. ireg <dig> was detected in both types of cells, with a predominantly cytosolic distribution pattern . the levels of ireg <dig> expression were directly proportional to the amount of iron in the culture. thus, it was determined by two independent methods that ireg <dig> expression in neuronal cells increased with cell iron content.

efflux of iron from neurons has never been reported. in view of the presence of ireg <dig>  we tested whether sh-sy5y cells actually had an iron efflux function. to that end, iron efflux from cells pre-cultured for  <dig> days with varied iron concentrations was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. this method was preferred to the use of radioisotopic iron since the latter could underestimate a putative iron efflux because of isotope dilution with the pre-existing iron pool . sh-sy5y cells had discrete but measurable iron efflux activity . the iron efflux rate increased markedly in the 20– <dig> μm fe range . interestingly, the efflux rate correlated closely with the presence of the  <dig>  kda band, while the correlation between efflux activity and the  <dig>  kda band was weaker .

discussion
the number of neurological diseases associated with iron accumulation in the brain underlines the need for increased knowledge of the mechanisms of brain iron homeostasis. in this study we show that iron accumulation by sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells and hippocampal neurons resulted in cell death of part of the population, while another fraction survived by adapting the expression of iron homeostasis proteins.

iron content increased significantly as a function of fe in the culture up to 20– <dig> μm fe, increasing very little thereafter up to  <dig> μm fe. cell iron increase was accompanied by increased ferritin content. the increase in ferritin more than compensated for the increase in iron. iron to ferritin mol ratios of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were obtained for  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> μm fe in the culture media. thus, the ire/irp system of sh-sy5y cells over-responded to iron accumulation in terms of ferritin expression. despite the increase in ferritin, the lip increased between  <dig>  and  <dig> μm fe. this finding clearly indicates that in sh-sy5y cells the level of labile iron is a function of total iron, even in the presence of ample ferritin supply. it is possible that ferritin-stored iron contributes to the lip each time that ferritin undergo lisosomal degradation.

iron accumulation was accompanied by a marked decrease in dmt <dig> expression. nevertheless, some dmt <dig> persisted even at 40– <dig> μm iron. the persistence of dmt <dig> at high iron concentrations could underline the continuous iron uptake observed under these conditions  <cit> . this is curious because at 40– <dig> μm fe cells were dying. sustained dmt <dig> expression points to the inability of neuronal cells to shut-off iron uptake and the need for additional defense mechanisms to prevent iron-mediated cell death.

the discovery of increased ireg <dig> expression in response to cell iron accumulation is a major break-through in the understanding of cell survival under conditions of iron accumulation. total ireg <dig>  and especially a putative ireg <dig> dimer, increased markedly in the 20– <dig> μm fe range. thus, in sh-sy5y cells ireg <dig> is up-regulated by increased cell iron. expressed ireg <dig> was functional since it associated with increased iron efflux activity. iron efflux activity in astrocytes  <cit>  and neurons  indicate that iron efflux from brain cells is a dynamic process, and highlights the importance of iron transporters as determinants of iron accumulation.

the regulation of ireg <dig> expression is unknown but seems to be cell-specific. in enterocytes, ireg <dig> expression is induced by iron deficiency  <cit>  while in macrophages iron increases ireg <dig> expression  <cit> . the findings reported here indicate that in neuronal cells ireg <dig> has a macrophage-like regulation. this is certainly the case for cells in the 40– <dig> μm range that survived to iron accumulation. ireg1's predominantly cytosolic distribution pattern is similar to that of kupffer cells  <cit> . again, this distribution points to macrophage-like behavior of neuronal ireg <dig>  in examining brain biopsies from alzheimer's patients an intriguing question arises: why do some neurons die or present evident signs of degeneration while others in the vicinity show a normal phenotype? extrapolating on the data presented here, it is tempting to hypothesize that surviving neurons induce ireg <dig> expression while sick neurons do not. nevertheless, at present we cannot exclude that other regulatory molecules may play a pivotal role under these conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
hippocampal neurons and sh-sy5y cells displayed an active system to regulate iron content. nevertheless, this system was unable to block iron accumulation which resulted in death of part of the cell population. another fraction of the cell population developed an adaptative mechanism that includes decreased expression of the import transporter dmt <dig> and increased expression of ferritin and the efflux transporter ireg <dig>  the finding that neurons regulate the expression of functional ireg <dig> opens new avenues for the understanding and possible treatment of iron-related neurodegenerative processes.
