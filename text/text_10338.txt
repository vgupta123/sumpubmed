BACKGROUND
colorectal cancer  is one of the most common causes of cancer worldwide affecting almost a million people annually and resulting in approximately  <dig>  deaths  <cit> . approximately 5% of individuals born today will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer during their lives, representing a lifetime risk of  <dig> in  <dig>  crc remains a serious threat to life with approximately 20% of patients presenting with late stage metastatic disease. although  <dig> year survival rates are favourable at 80-90% for early stage disease, this drops significantly to less than 10% with the presence of distal metastasis.

the majority of colorectal tumours originate from adenomatous precursor lesions and develop along a well-defined adenoma-carcinoma sequence. according to this model the culmination of mutational events including activation of oncogenes and loss of function of tumour suppressor genes results in the emergence of carcinomas  <cit> . molecular profiling across the spectrum of normal-adenoma-tumour tissue types has yielded many candidate genes in the search for novel molecular diagnostic and prognostic markers and treatment strategies  <cit> . in latter years real-time quantitative  pcr has become established as the gold standard for accurate, sensitive and rapid quantification of gene expression  <cit> . in comparison to alternative methods such as northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays , rq-pcr has been universally adopted as the transcriptomic method of choice due to its superiority with regard to speed, sensitivity, reproducibility and the wide range of instrumentation and reagents commercially available.

to accurately quantify an mrna target by rq-pcr, samples are assayed during the exponential phase of the pcr reaction during which the amount of target is assumed to double with each cycle of pcr without bias due to limiting reagents. analysis of cycle threshold , the cycle number at which signals are detected above background, can be used to estimate gene expression levels by relating ct values either to a standard curve  or to a control gene . the latter method requires the generation of standard curves of known copy number for each target and so is limited due to logistical issues associated with the generation of standards in studies of multiple gene targets. relative quantification is the most widely adopted approach and as the name suggests, quantification of gene expression is based on the analysis of a target gene whose expression is normalised relative to the expression of a control gene. central to the reliable determination of gene expression is the choice of control gene with which to normalise real-time data from target genes. normalisation can be achieved using endogenous or exogenous controls; however the use of endogenous control  genes is the most widely adopted approach as it excludes variation associated with differences in amounts of template rna. vandestompele et al  <dig> described a normalisation method whereby geometrical averaging of multiple ec genes improved accuracy  <cit> . this approach has been adopted to reliably measure levels of gene expression in many studies in different tissue types including breast  <cit> , lung  <cit> , kidney  <cit> , brain  <cit>  and liver  <cit> .

an ideal ec gene  should be stably expressed and unaffected by parameters such as disease status and in the case of crc, should remain unaffected by whether a tissue was derived from normal, adenoma or carcinoma lesions. traditionally gapdh  has been widely used to normalise rq-pcr data. a common feature of earlier studies was that the stability of reference gene expression between different sample types was assumed with little consideration paid to validation of these ec genes as suitable normalisers. more recent studies have brought into question the stability of commonly used ec genes such as gapdh on the basis that gene expression levels have been found to vary in response to treatment or as a result of physiological, pathological or experimental changes. for example, alteration in oxygen tension and hypoxia were found to be associated with wide variation in gapdh, b-actin and cyclophilin expression  <cit> . in addition, gapdh expression was found to be strongly unregulated in diabetic patients and down-regulated in response to the administration of bisphosphonate compounds in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer  <cit> . other evidence indicates that neoplastic growth can affect ec expression levels  <cit> . goidin et al  <cit>  found differences in the expression of gapdh and b-actin in two sub-populations of melanoma cells derived from a tumour in a single patient. treatment agents such as dexamethasone, deprenyl and isatin also affect ec gene expression  <cit> . schmittgen et al  <cit>  reported increased expression of gapdh, b2m, 18s rrna and Î²-actin in fibroblasts after the addition of serum: evidence of the effect of experimental conditions on ec expression. these findings were further supported by wu et al  <cit>  in their investigation of the effect of different skin irritants on gapdh and polya+ rna expression. gapdh was found to be involved in age-induced apoptosis in mature cerebellar cells  <cit>  and also as a trna binding protein present in the nuclei of hela cells  <cit> .

as the use of unreliable ecs can result in inaccurate results, the identification of the most reliable gene or set of genes at the outset of an investigation is critical. thus far, a pervasive stably expressed gene  has yet to be identified across all tissue types  <cit> . this would indicate that the identification of robust ecs at the outset of transcriptomic analysis would yield more reliable and meaningful rq-pcr data.

the aim of this study was to evaluate a panel of thirteen candidate ec genes from which to identify the most stably expressed gene  to normalise rq-pcr data derived from primary colorectal tumour and tumour associated normal  tissue. six of the candidate ec genes were selected from the literature and represent the most frequently studied reference genes in cancer including, but not limited to, colorectal cancer. each gene was previously reported as being constitutively expressed in various tissues. these ec genes included b2m   <cit> , hprt   <cit> , gapdh  <cit> , actb   <cit> , ppia   <cit>  and mrpl <dig>   <cit> . the remaining seven genes included hcrt, slc25a <dig>  dtx <dig>  apoc <dig>  rtdr <dig>  krtap12- <dig>  and chrnb <dig>  the latter candidates were selected from an unpublished whole genome microarray dataset of  <dig> human tumour specimens and represented the most stably expressed probes with a fold-change of  <dig> - <dig> , . expression of cxcl <dig>  <cit> , fabp <dig>  <cit> , muc <dig>  <cit>  and pdcd <dig> genes were chosen as targets against which to measure the effects of candidate ec expression on the basis of their previously identified roles in tumourigenesis. in addition to its tumour suppressor properties, pdcd <dig>  <cit>  also has diagnostic and prognostic utility and represents a promising target for anti-cancer therapy.

RESULTS
range of expression of candidate ec genes
a range of ct values was observed across the candidate ec genes in tumour and tan tissue from crc patients as indicated in table  <dig>  only samples with a standard deviation <  <dig>  from the mean ct of the triplicates were included for further analysis. the expression of rtdr <dig>  hcrt, apoc <dig> and krtap12- <dig> could not be determined in all  <dig> tissue samples, resultantly these candidates were excluded from further analysis.

mean ct values for the remaining genes ranged from  <dig>   for b2m to  <dig>   for chrnb <dig>  b2m displayed the narrowest range of ct values between  <dig>  and  <dig>   followed by ppia and mrpl <dig>  while actb had the widest range of ct values between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the genes broadly fell into three categories, those least abundant genes with mean ct values of 27- <dig> , moderately abundant genes with mean ct values of 22- <dig>  and the most abundant highly expressed genes with mean ct values of 19- <dig>  table  <dig> 

b2m and ppia were the most abundantly expressed genes, having the lowest mean ct values while mrpl <dig> was the least abundantly expressed gene with average ct values >  <dig>  both b2m and ppia had the lowest range in their ct values.

identification of optimal ec genes
scaled expression levels across the remaining nine candidate ecs analysed  indicated within-gene differences in expression between tumour and normal tissue groups in both slc25a <dig>  and chrnb <dig>  but not in the remaining genes , . therefore, slc25a <dig> and chrnb <dig> genes were excluded from further analysis. significant differences in variance of ec expression were identified using levene's test . these findings necessitated further evaluation of each candidate ec gene prior to their possible use to accurately quantitate gene expression levels of the target genes cxcl <dig>  fabp <dig>  muc <dig> and pdcd <dig> 

the stability of candidate ec genes was analysed using genorm  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit>  programmes. stability was further evaluated using qbaseplus  <cit> , a commercially available rq-pcr data mining package. these programmes were used to calculate amplification efficiency-corrected relative quantities from raw fluorescence data. the ranking of candidate ec genes as determined by each of these programmes is illustrated in table  <dig>  in the case of genorm the variable v indicating the pairwise variation  between two sequential normalisation factors  indicated that three ec genes was the optimal number of genes for accurate normalisation , however, target genes expression did not differ significantly if two rather than three ec genes were used . use of all three programmes confirmed that b2m and ppia was the best combination of genes for normalising rq-pcr data in crc tissues . the equivalence test  <cit>  was used to examine the expression of candidate ecs. all genes were equivalently expressed between the normal and tumour colorectal tissues using a fold cut-off of  <dig> .

for genorm, lower stability values  indicate greater stability. in the case of normfinder, stability is calculated from inter- and intra-group variation. by grouping the tissues into tumour and normal the best combination of genes was identified. for genorm stability was based on the estimation of pair-wise variation. qbaseplus through its components, genorm and qbase, identified coefficient of variation  and stability  values and thereby the best combination of genes for normalisation only when more than one gene is used.

association between ec genes and target genes
there was a significant effect of the expression of the candidate ec genes on relative expression of cxcl <dig> , fabp <dig> , muc <dig>  and pdcd <dig>  . moreover, a significant effect of the choice of ec with regard to the estimation of error  was also detected. these findings were further confirmed for each ec gene compared to each other by anova tukey post hoc tests . the combined use of b2m and ppia significantly reduced the magnitude of error in comparison to the use of either gene individually for both cxcl <dig> and pdcd <dig> expression. the addition of a third ec gene  to the b2m/ppia combination did not result in any further improvement of the estimation of error .

non-normalised expression levels of target genes
to assess whether normalisation was necessary in a large cohort such as this in which the biological effect of the target genes is already established, we compared the expression of the four target genes in tumour vs. normal tissues using non-normalised cycle threshold  values in the entire sample set  and in a sub-set of randomly selected  <dig> normal and  <dig> tumour tissues . this analysis showed down-regulated target gene  expression in tumour compared to normal tissues , in keeping with their documented tumour suppressor functions, when using the larger set of samples. the unchanged target gene expression levels in the large cohort could be explained by the fact that in larger sample sizes the biological milieu may diminish subtle variations in individual samples. in contrast, when the smaller sample size was used, no significant differences in target gene expression were observed. furthermore the expression levels of pdcd <dig> appeared slightly higher in tumours than in normal tissues. when the same subset of  <dig> samples were normalised with ppia/b2m, significant differences in target gene expression were observed.

discussion
since its introduction in  <dig>  <cit>  many methods have been developed for the analysis real-time quantitative pcr data. relative quantification has come to the fore as the method of choice due to its superior flexibility and reduction in inherent variation associated with sample preparation. prior to the availability of high-throughput realtime pcr instrumentation, a handful of genes were commonly used to normalise real-time data. major technological advances enabling high throughput analysis of both samples and target genes have enabled investigation and validation of putative ec genes prior to their use to normalise target gene expression. it is now accepted that the use of more than one gene to normalise rq data improves experimental accuracy compared to the use of a single ec gene  <cit> 

in their study of ec gene expression in breast and colon cancer tissues tricarico et al  <cit>  illustrated significant variation in the expression levels of  <dig> commonly used housekeeping genes including 18s rrna, both between individuals and between biopsies taken from the same patient. they concluded that normalisation to a single ec gene was inappropriate for human tissue samples. moreover, vandesompele et al identified errors of up to  <dig>  fold when a single ec gene was used in comparison to the use of multiple genes for data normalisation  <cit>  thereby clearly indicating the potential for superior accuracy when due consideration is paid to the choice of ec genes.

many analytical programmes for relative quantification have been developed, certain of which enable the identification of ec genes from a study population  <cit> . in the present study the stability of expression of candidate ec genes was determined using a pair-wise comparison model: genorm  <cit>  and an ms excel anova based model, normfinder  <cit> . no effect of disease status ec gene expression was identified in colorectal tissue. since both genorm and normfinder are based on the assumption that candidate genes are not differentially expressed between samples, this was an important first step prior to their continued use  <cit> .

in this study genorm was used to identify the most stably expressed ec genes from our panel of candidates and also provided a measure of the optimal number of ec genes. b2m and ppia were identified as the most stable pairing. in order to achieve a pair-wise variation value  below the cut-off of  <dig>  additional genes should theoretically be used; however this cut-off point is not absolute  <cit>  and may not always be achievable  <cit> . no significant difference in target gene expression was observed when the top three most stable ec genes identified by genorm were used confirming that using of a pair of genes may be more practicable given cost, work load and sample availability considerations.

normfinder was designed to identify ec genes with the lowest stability values; these values are calculated based on intra- and inter-group variation. in this study normfinder was used to define the best combination of genes using tumour and normal as group identifiers in the calculations. mrpl <dig> was selected as the most stable gene using these criteria; however b2m and ppia were highlighted as the best combination of genes with even lower stability value compared to mrpl <dig> alone. qbaseplus real-time pcr data manager programme was developed based on genorm and qbase  <cit>  algorithms. qbaseplus was used to confirm our selection of the b2m and ppia pairing as the best combination of ecs in colorectal tissue.

equivalence testing was developed in biostatistics to address the situation where the aim is not to show the difference between groups, but rather to establish that two methods are equal to one another. in equivalence testing, the null hypothesis is that the two groups are not equivalent to one another, and hence rejection of the null indicates that the two groups are equivalent. therefore, as stated by haller et al, there is a risk of accepting non-differentially expressed genes as suitable controls although they are not equivalently expressed  <cit> . equivalence of expression between tumour and normal colorectal tissue was confirmed for all candidate ec genes using the equivalence test and a fold cut-off of  <dig>  dtx <dig>  b2m, mrpl <dig> and ppia showed the minimum of variability in the confidence interval hence can be used for normalisation.

in their study to identify ec genes to monitor enterocyte differentiation and to compare normal and adenocarcinoma of the colon from microarray data, dydensborg et al  <cit>  recommended rplp <dig> for normalising gene quantification in human intestinal epithelial cells and b2m for studying gene expression in human colon cancer. in addition, blanquicett et al  <cit>  analysed the extent of variability in gene expression between tumour and normal colorectal and liver tissues using two-tailed t tests. they showed that 18s, s <dig> and gus were the least variable genes in normal and metastatic liver specimens and were also appropriate for normal and tumour colorectal tissues. in the present study, we confirmed that more than one ec gene is required for optimal normalisation in colorectal tissue. we used clinico-pathologically diverse tissues to systematically evaluate normalisation of gene expression data in colorectal tissues. we also conducted equivalence testing to confirm the equality of expression of each ec gene. thereby, the risks of incorrect rejection  and of false negativity  were minimised.

as stated above significant differences in target gene expression were noticed when using each of the ec genes and the combination of ppia and b2m. moreover, significant effect of ec on the magnitude of error associated with estimation of target gene expression was also determined in this study . our results were further confirmed by post hoc testing of individual levels of ec gene expression . reduction in the magnitude of error achieved using the combination of ppia and b2m in comparison to using individual ec genes alone, further indicates that using two ec genes to normalise real-time data achieves greater accuracy in the determination of gene expression levels.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings reported in this study confirm that use of two ec genes to normalise rq-pcr data resulted in superior accuracy in the quantification of gene expression in colorectal tissue. the combined use of b2m and ppia was validated as the optimal pair of ec genes with which to estimate the expression of all four target genes in colorectal cancer tissue. although these ecs may not be ideal in other tissue types, the approach described herein could serve as a template to identify valid ecs in other tissue types.
