BACKGROUND
genome-wide association  studies have been used to identify over  <dig> potential causal loci in complex diseases such as metabolic/cardiovascular disorder, autoimmune disorder, and cancer  <cit> . the approach requires a stringent adherence to quality control, statistical analyses and replication studies  <cit> . in quantitative trait loci  analysis, there is an implicit assumption that the phenotype data follow a normal distribution. violation of this assumption can severely affect the power and type i error  <cit> .

in most cases, quantitative traits are not normally distributed and one strategy is to perform parametric transformation to approximate normality. in cases where the traits are left-skewed, the appropriate transformation may not be so straight-forward. transformation is crucial for meta-analyses, where two or more populations are combined to improve statistical power. preferably, the traits are transformed similarly to enable comparison of genetic effects. this may prove challenging when the traits from different populations are not similarly distributed and cannot be transformed in the same manner. literature search in this area shows evaluation of normalization methods in pedigree studies  <cit> , looking at the logarithm, power, and rank-based transformations, and giving mixed results. in labbe and wormald  <cit> , box-cox and log were compared and box-cox was found to perform better. peng et al  <cit>  evaluated enqt, a rank-based transformation in variance components and semi-parametric qtl models, showing enqt improved power. for diao and lin  <cit> , the question was not which normalization worked best but whether the semi-parametric qtl performed better than the variance-components models in terms of power and type i error, as well as robustness to outliers when the assumption of normality does not hold. nevertheless, diao and lin's simulations showed that estimated and true transformations  gave higher power and lower type i error for likelihood-ratio tests compared to the logarithm, the square-root  and untransformed data.

in the absence of comprehensive study on various transformation methods for association studies, it is difficult to decide which transformation to apply. how much normality will suffice for the underlying assumption of association tests? in the context of sample size and genetic effects, what are the effects of these methods? although it is generally accepted that deviation from normality can reduce the power of the study, the effects of different normalization methods are not clearly understood.

in this paper, we report the effects of these normalization methods in basic quantitative association tests on simulated data. our objective was to quantify the effects of normalization in gwa studies. since a large sample is needed to detect small effects, we also evaluated the effects of normalization on varying sample sizes and genetics effects. for simplicity, we limit our study on additive models. we also approached the evaluation by emulating gwa studies, measuring performance of the normalization based on the sensitivity of discovering causal single nucleotide polymorphism  and its respective ranking in association tests after bonferroni corrections.

RESULTS
to assess the effects of normalization, genotype data was generated from a disease model with one causal snp allele using hapsimu  <cit> . for each sample size and genetic effect,  <dig> datasets were generated. the average minor allele frequency  for the causal snp was  <dig> . four traits,  <dig> transformations,  <dig> samples sizes and  <dig> genetic effects were evaluated. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of genotype-specific traits in the simulated dataset for sample size of  <dig> and  <dig>  phenotypic variance explained . figure  <dig> shows the traits distributions of an example data from this dataset after each transformation. figure  <dig> shows the sensitivity of rank-based transformation for each sample size and pv. table  <dig> shows the sensitivity, false positive rate, and displacement of causal snp for pv of  <dig> . the same trend was observed for other pv of  <dig>  and  <dig>  . in gwa studies, besides genome-wide significance p-value after multiple testing corrections, the ranking of the causal snp is also important. preferably, the causal snp should be ranked high in the list. the displacement is the rank of the causal snp, minus  <dig>  the expected rank.

discussion
a gwa study is an expensive venture which requires careful design and quality control. one such consideration is normalization. our simulation indicated that in studies where the effects and sample size were large; transformation had little effect. performance issues arise when the genetic effect was less than moderate and sample size was not large. in this case, the type of normalization became a serious consideration with impacts on results.

the results showed that larger pv  and samples size generally gave higher sensitivity and smaller displacement with a slight increase in false positive rate. when pv varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , untransformed normal distribution showed sensitivity of  <dig> % to  <dig> % ,  <dig> % to  <dig> % , and  <dig> % to  <dig> %  for  <dig> to  <dig> samples . when the phenotype was rank transformed, the sensitivity ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % ,  <dig> % to  <dig> %  and  <dig> % to 100%  respectively. this is in concordance with literature; with larger sample size and genetic effects, the causal snp is more likely to be discovered. it also showed improved results with rank-based transformation for all phenotypes, though the amount of improvement depends on sample size and pv. the improvement factor for sensitivity  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>   for pv =  <dig> . for pv =  <dig> , the improvement factor ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the improvement factor tended towards  <dig> for pv =  <dig> , indicating that for larger genetic effects, transformation was not so critical . this trend was also observed in the case of larger sample size regardless of the distribution of original traits.

displacement of causal snp decreased with increasing sample size and pv. for pv =  <dig>  and  <dig> samples of the untransformed trait, the causal snp was ranked on average  <dig>  out of  <dig>  this improved to  <dig>   and  <dig>  . with rank-based transformation, the displacement improved:  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>  .

false positive rate is a concern in gwa studies. in our study, the false positive rate increased with pv and sample size. the simulation showed that rank-based transformation incurred a slightly higher false positive compared with the other methods. we recognize that the false positive rate computed here was subjective, depending on the  <dig> non-causal snps in simulated data. nevertheless, it gave an indication of false positives amongst the different settings in simulations; i.e. traits distribution, sample size, and genetic effects. does this mean that rank transformation has no benefits? for small sample size and genetic effects, the increase of sensitivity outweighs the slight increase in false positive rate. for large sample size and genetic effects, this is not true so caution is needed on transformation. we propose no transformation in this scenario.

despite the concerns of rank-based transformation being too 'perfect', results showed that it improved the sensitivity and ranking, both important in deciding genes or loci of interest for fine-mapping. one of the reasons sensitivity improved was due to the effects transformation had on the distribution of each genotype. the transformation attempted to keep the distribution of each genotype within its respective tertile  while maintaining a variance of  <dig> . in the additive model, the distribution of aa after rank-based transformation veered towards the 33th percentile of the distribution and the bb's distribution towards 67th percentile. the consistent variance of  <dig> in each genotype meant less overlap between the distributions, accentuating the discriminating additive signals in association test. this also explained why false positive increased correspondingly since the same effects would be applicable on non-causal snps.

it was noted in figure  <dig> that the normally distributed trait did not follow a perfect normal distribution. in transformation such as log or beta, as long as the original trait followed a normal-like distribution, each trait would transform accordingly to left-skew, right-skew, or bimodal as intended. as for the effects of normality of the original trait on results, we observed that generally the original normal distribution did not perform as well as the rank transformation, suggesting that a 'perfect' normal distribution was desirable at least for small sample size and genetic effects.

in the simulations, box-cox sometimes achieved a normal distribution  though not perfectly normal like the rank-based transformation. however, its performance was still not comparable with the latter. in addition, it was observed that although some distribution appeared normal, rank-based transformation could still improve sensitivity. this is interesting as it suggests that it is not just sufficient to attain some form of normality for quantitative traits but to achieve a normality that increases the additive discriminating signals. transformation should also be considered in the context of sample size and genetic effects. in large sample size and more than moderate effects, it may not be necessary to transform, thus maintaining a lower false positive with comparable sensitivity and displacement. for conditions other than this, rank-based transformation tends to improve the performance regardless of the distribution.

in our literature review, the traits were usually generated as non-normally distributed trait and not well defined traits such as those in our study  where we could assess the effects of transformation on different distributions. this arises from the difficulty of generating quantitative traits to meet these distributions using genotype, especially using real genotype data. in peng et al , the normal trait was transformed to meet certain skewness and kurtosis for their evaluation. we adopted the same idea in our simulation by transforming the trait after genotype has been generated. this approach has the advantage of allowing us to use existing genotype data  to study effects of different trait distributions.

CONCLUSIONS
the four quantitative traits investigated here are common distributions described by several statistical empirical distributions. simulations were done on common factors affecting results of gwa study, such as normalization, sample size, and genetic effects. the simulation showed that rank-based transformation gave the best performance in terms of sensitivity and displacement regardless of the distribution of the trait. this is however accompanied by a slight increase in false positive rate. the positive effect of rank-based transformation decreased with increasing sample size and genetic effects. for large sample size and genetic effects, normalization is not recommended.
