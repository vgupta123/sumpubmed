BACKGROUND
massive transfer of genes from the plastid to the nucleus occurred following the endosymbiotic origin of the plastid from cyanobacteria  <cit> . photosynthetic land plant plastid genomes  only encode 101– <dig> genes, most of which represent genetic system and photosynthetic genes  <cit> . a considerable number of organelle-targeted genes in the nucleus are translated in the cytosol and imported into the plastids and mitochondria where they perform essential functions. many studies have revealed that gene transfer from organelles to the nucleus is an ongoing process  <cit> , however subsequent molecular characterization of these events has been limited. transferred plastid genes must obtain nuclear expression elements as well as transit peptides for import of gene products into the plastids  <cit> . successful functional gene transfers from the plastid to the nucleus in seed plants have been documented for only four genes: infa in multiple lineages  <cit> , rpl <dig> in fabaceae and fagaceae  <cit> , rpl <dig> in rhizophoraceae and salicaceae  <cit>  and accd in trifolium  <cit> . transferred plastid genes have either adopted a transit peptide from an existing nuclear gene or acquired a novel transit peptide  <cit> . in addition to functional gene transfers, movement of dna fragments from the plastid to the nucleus is common among flowering plants   <cit> , and the proportion of nupts differs considerably among species  <cit> .

the angiosperm family ranunculaceae  exhibits enormous ecological, anatomical, biochemical, and morphological diversity and comprises approximately  <dig>  species in  <dig> genera and five subfamilies distributed throughout the world  <cit> . ranunculaceae have two chromosome types: r -type with large chromosomes, and t -type with small chromosomes  <cit> . although there are several different classification systems for ranunculaceae  <cit> , multiple lines of evidence suggest that genera with the t-type chromosome  form a monophyletic group  <cit> . thalictrum, a member of the subfamily thalictroideae, is one of the most diverse genera of ranunculaceae in terms of number of species and morphological variation  <cit> . recent studies have estimated phylogenetic relationships of thalictrum using molecular data to understand the evolution of sexual systems and polyploidy  <cit> . this genus has great medicinal value because it contains high levels of thaliblastin , which has anticancer properties  <cit> . thalictrum coreanum is a popular, economically important endemic plant native to korea and it is used widely in horticulture and medicine. its natural habitat is restricted to small areas in korea and it is often confused with a species of berberidaceae, epimedium koreanum, which is used in traditional chinese and korean herbal medicine as a potent enhancer of erectile function.

previous studies performed restriction site mapping of the plastid genome of ranunculaceae and identified several phylogenetically informative rearrangements, including inversions, the loss of the rps <dig> gene and loss of the rps <dig> cis-spliced intron  <cit> . the complete plastid genome sequences of only two species of ranunculaceae have been reported  <cit>  and neither of these are members of the subfamily thalictroideae.

in this study the plastome sequence of t. coreanum is presented, which represents the first sequenced member of the subfamily thalictroideae. genome organization is examined, including identification of transfers of two genes, infa and rpl <dig>  from the plastid to the nucleus. in addition, the phylogenetic distribution of the rpl <dig> gene loss in the ranunculaceae is examined. the plastome sequence of t. coreanum provides valuable additional information about variation within the ranunculaceae.

RESULTS
plastome of thalictrum coreanum
the thalictrum coreanum plastome is  <dig>  bp with a pair of inverted repeats  of  <dig>  bp separated by a small single copy  region of  <dig>  bp and a large single copy  region of  <dig>  bp . the genome encodes  <dig> different genes, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrna genes and consists of  <dig> % genes  . the translation initiation factor a  is a pseudogene due to the presence of frameshift mutations. the ribosomal protein l <dig> , which is usually located between ndhf and trnl-uag , is a pseudogene because deletions near the 5’ end generate two internal stop codons.figure  <dig>

general features of the plastomes of three ranunculaceae are summarized in table  <dig>  compared with two other sequenced ranunculaceae plastomes  <cit> , megaleranthis saniculifolia and ranunculus macranthus, changes in genome organization reflect shifts of the irs at the lsc/ir boundary relative to nicotiana tabacum . for example, irb of t. coreanum and m. saniculifolia extends into the lsc to include the n-terminal portion of rps <dig>  generating a truncated rps <dig> fragment in ira. however, in r. macranthus, ira extends into the lsc to include the c-terminal portion of trnh-gug, generating a trnh-gug fragment in irb. in terms of gene losses, the infa loss is shared by t. coreanum and r. macranthus, whereas m. saniculifolia contains an intact infa gene in its plastome. the presence of rpl <dig> as a pseudogene is unique to t. coreanum among all three ranuculaceae analyzed.

identification of functional gene transfers to the nucleus
to determine if the plastid-encoded rpl <dig> gene in thalictrum has been transferred to the nucleus, the transcriptome database  for t. thalictroides was queried with the rpl <dig> coding sequence of m. saniculifolia and r. macranthus. a transcript with high sequence identity to rpl <dig> is present and has an extended sequence of 417 bp upstream from the conserved ribosomal protein l <dig> domain . the first  <dig> amino acids of the open reading frame  is predicted by both targetp and predotar to be a transit peptide that is targeted to the plastid . the extended region including the transit peptide had no significant hits with blastn to any sequences in the ncbi databases and phytozome genomics portal. extensive searching of the phytozome genomics portal revealed the presence of a nuclear-encoded rpl <dig> orf in aquilegia coerulea, which is also a member of the subfamily thalictroideae. the sequence upstream from the conserved domain also has a transit peptide . however, an rpl32-like gene sequence was not detected in the hydrastis canadensis transcriptome. alignment of the nuclear-encoded rpl <dig> from thalictrum and aquilegia revealed a pairwise nucleotide sequence identity of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the extended region and the conserved domain, respectively . amino acid alignment of four nuclear-encoded rpl <dig> copies  shows that the extended region of thalictrum is highly similar to aquilegia with  <dig> % identity, whereas populus and bruguiera are highly divergent with very low identities  to thalictrum . the conserved ribosomal protein l <dig> domain of nuclear and plastid copies has pairwise identities ranging from  <dig> % to 100% .table  <dig>

phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear-encoded rpl <dig> copies  and the plastid-encoded copies from  <dig> other angiosperms show that the thalictrum and aquilegia nuclear copies are nested within a clade with the plastid copies of the two ranunculaceae ranunculus and megaleranthis, and the populus and bruguiera nuclear-encoded copies are grouped with the rosid cucumis . the nuclear copies of thalictrum and aquilegia group together with high bootstrap support . the branch lengths on the tree indicate that the four nuclear-encoded copies have much higher substitution rates compared to plastid-encoded copies of closely related species. however, bootstrap support across the angiosperms is weak because the tree is based on only a single, short gene sequence.

to examine rate variation further, pairwise analysis of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  substitutions for plastid and nuclear rpl <dig> homologs was performed . the analysis shows higher divergence in both aquilegia and thalictrum nuclear-encoded genes compared to other species of ranunculaceae. higher sequence divergence in the populus nuclear-encoded copy is also evident. the synonymous substitution rate of thalictrum and aquilegia clade is  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than their closest relatives megaleranthis and ranunculus, respectively. the branch lengths on the tree indicate that the thalictrum copy has experienced much higher synonymous substitution rates than aquilegia . the correlation of dn and ds was moderate . the dn/ds ratio among plastid copies shows similar patterns with ds larger than dn, which is also the case for the three nuclear copies .figure  <dig>

in addition, a blast search of the t. thalictroides transcriptome from the 1kp database identified one or more transcripts of the translation initiation factor if <dig>  domain that has a transit peptide for targeting back to the plastid . the aquilegia transcriptome databases from phytozome v. <dig> were queried with the infa domain sequence from the thalictrum nuclear copy, confirming an infa-like orf acquired a transit peptide . examination of the aquilegia coerulea v <dig>  nuclear genome  showed the presence of the nuclear-encoded infa gene containing two exons totaling  <dig>  bp separated by a 105 bp intron . nuclear-like infa sequences were not detected in the hydrastis transcriptome.

characterization of rpl <dig> gene in the subfamily thalictroideae
the plastid-encoded rpl <dig> is a pseudogene in t. coreanum . seventeen additional species of thalictrum representing two subgenera were surveyed for the presence of a pseudogene using pcr and sanger sequencing . in t. thalictroides, pcr failed to amplify a product, which may be due to variation in primer binding sites. the product sequence sizes for the other  <dig> species of thalictrum range from 745 bp in t. alpinum to  <dig>  bp in t. rochebrunianum . blast searches using intact rpl <dig> from m. saniculifolia  and r. macranthus  revealed that  <dig> examined thalictrum species have remnant sequences of rpl <dig>  ranging from  <dig> to 210 bp . however, one species, t. alpinum, lacks any detectable rpl32-like sequences, suggesting a loss of the entire gene. nucleotide alignment of rpl <dig> revealed a consistent pattern, the majority of indel events are shared by members of the t. coreaum clade .figure  <dig>

to further investigate the rpl <dig> gene loss, six other genera  were examined in the subfamily thalictroideae. the results show frameshift mutations due to insertions and deletions  in five of the genera , and the sixth genus leptopyrum has entirely lost rpl <dig>  maximum likelihood  analysis of a concatenated data set resolves phylogenetic relationships among members of the subfamily thalictroideae with bootstrap values of 98% for the monophyly of thalictrum and 100% for the monophyly of subfamily thalictroideae . overall the rpl <dig> gene in the plastid genome of subfamily thalictroideae is likely nonfunctional due to indels that disrupt the reading frame.

correlation between reduction of ndhf-trnl intergenic spacer and rpl <dig> gene loss
the ndhf-trnl intergenic spacer  including rpl <dig> gene, which is either a pseudogene or absent within the subfamily thalictroideae, shows considerable length variation . this igs region in the subfamily thalictroideae is nearly two times shorter than in other angiosperms . both t-test and wilcoxon signed rank test estimates indicated that the mean size of igs between the two groups is significantly different .figure  <dig>

discussion
functional gene transfer to the nucleus
two protein coding genes, translation initiation factor a  and ribosomal protein l <dig> , are pseudogenes in the t. coreanum plastome. in case of infa, multiple independent losses have been reported across angiosperms including caltha from the ranunculaceae  <cit> . this previous report, combined with the phylogenetic distribution of infa loss from the sequenced ranunculaceae genomes, indicates that this gene has been lost multiple times in the family. in order for a gene transfer event to be successful, transferred genes must acquire a transit peptide to shuttle the product back into plastids. nuclear-encoded infa copies from thalictrum and aquilegia were identified in the transcriptome and they have high levels of sequence identity. in view of the high nucleotide sequence identity of both infa  and the transit peptide , it is likely that there has been a single transfer of this gene to the nucleus within the subfamily thalictroideae, although expanded sampling is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

most ribosomal protein subunits have been transferred to the nuclear genome since the endosymbiotic origin of plastids; however, land plant plastid genomes still retain a set of  <dig> small ribosomal protein subunits  and  <dig> large ribosomal protein subunits   <cit> . among the remaining plastid-encoded rps and rpl genes, several examples of gene losses across seed plants have been demonstrated  <cit> . comparative analysis of the three sequenced ranunculaceae plastomes  indicates that the loss of the plastid-encoded rpl <dig> gene is unique to the thalictrum plastome. however, comparisons of  <dig> additional thalictrum species suggest that pseudogenization of the plastid encoded rpl <dig> gene occurred within the entire genus . alignment of rpl <dig> pseudogenes from the sequenced thalictrum species with intact rpl <dig> genes from m. saniculifolia and r. macranthus reveals that the majority of indel events are shared by members of the t. coreaum clade , indicating that the deletions occurred in the ancestor of this clade. examination of the transcriptome sequences of thalictrum and aquilegia reveals that rpl <dig> has been transferred to the nucleus and acquired a target peptide for transport back to the plastid . the nuclear copies from aquilegia and thalictrum have high sequence identity at both nucleotide and amino acid levels . the transferred genes have significantly elevated synonymous substitution rates and have experienced purifying selection . phylogenetic analysis provided strong support for monophyly of the nuclear-encoded rpl <dig> copies , suggesting a single transfer of rpl <dig> to the nucleus. plastid-encoded rpl <dig> gene losses have also been reported from bruguiera, populus, yucca, and some parasitic plants  <cit> . there is evidence in only two of these cases, bruguiera and populus, that rpl <dig> has been functionally transferred to the nucleus  <cit> . in the case of bruguiera and populus rpl <dig> fused to an existing nuclear gene  to acquire a transit peptide, whereas thalictrum and aquilegia have acquired a novel transit peptide.

loss of plastid-encoded rpl <dig> gene in the subfamily thalictroideae
the high level of conservation of genome organization among the three sequenced ranunculaceae plastomes enabled a pcr and sequencing survey of the ndhf and trnl-uag region, which contains the rpl <dig> gene. the absence of intact rpl <dig> gene was identified for seven genera of the subfamily thalictroideae  and the evolutionary fate of the plastid-encoded rpl <dig> differed among the genera or species examined; the gene is completely absent in leptopyrum and t. alpinum and pseudogenes of varying length are present in the remaining species . this suggests that rpl <dig> was transferred to the nucleus in the ancestor of subfamily thalictroideae. previous studies have shown that reductions of igs regions are caused by gene loss, which has led to a more compact genome  <cit> . although most examined thalictroideae have a portion of rpl <dig> remaining, the ndhf-trnl intergenic spacer is significantly shorter in the subfamily thalictroideae than in other angiosperms  due to extreme degradation of the igs. this finding indicates that the reduction of the ndhf and trnl-uag igs region is associated with the loss or pseudogenization of rpl <dig> 

two different types of chromosomes based on size have been characterized in ranunculaceae, r-type and t-type  <cit> . the subfamilies thalictroideae and hydrastidoideae belong to t-type chromosome group, however, phylogenetic analyses have shown that these two subfamilies are polyphyletic  <cit> . the distribution of the transfer of rpl <dig> to the nucleus in thalictrum and aquilegia but not in hydrastis indicates that this transfer does not represent a synapomorphy for the lineages with the t-type chromosomes.

fior et al.  <cit>  used the rbcl, matk and 26s nuclear ribosomal dna  sequences generated by wang et al.  <cit>  to infer divergence times for the main clades of the ranunculaceae. the divergence time of the subfamily thalictroideae was estimated at  <dig>  mya . another estimate indicated slightly later divergence times with the shorter interval for the subfamily thalictroideae at  <dig>  mya   <cit> . thus, the transfer of rpl <dig> to the nucleus at the base of the subfamily thalictroideae occurred approximately 20– <dig> mya.

the monophyly of subfamily thalictroideae has been confirmed based on phylogenetic analyses of multiple dna markers: rbcl, matk, trnl-f spacer, and 26s nrdna  <cit> , 26s nrdna  <cit> , and atpb, rbcl, and 18s nrdna  <cit> . the rpl <dig> gene transfer event, combined with divergence time estimates, provides valuable phylogenetic data in support of the monophyly of subfamily thalictroideae. although there are multiple examples of plastid gene losses that exhibit homoplasy , the loss of rpl <dig> by all sampled members of subfamily thalictroideae provides an excellent example of a genomic change that supports the monophyly of this subfamily.

CONCLUSIONS
the plastome sequence of thalictrum coreanum, the first genome completed from the subfamily thalictroideae, provides new insights into the evolution of plastomes within ranunculaceae. the t. coreanum plastome is highly conserved with gene order identical to the ancestral organization of angiosperms  <cit>  and at 155 kb it has the median genome size for photosynthetic land plants  <cit> . the only unusual feature of the plastome is the loss of two genes, infa and rpl <dig>  examination of nuclear transcriptomes indicates that both of these genes have been transferred to the nucleus. comparing the plastome sequence of thalictrum with the two other ranunculaceae and the survey of the rpl <dig> gene loss resolve the phylogenetic distribution and timing of this gene loss/transfer event in ranunculaceae.
