BACKGROUND
the free ionic iron  concentration in the human body is kept at a very low level to limit bacterial growth. this is achieved through fe-carrier proteins like transferrin and lactoferrin that bind ferric fe  with a high affinity. pathogenic bacteria however have developed powerful mechanisms that are capable of chelating fe at very low concentrations.

coagulase negative staphylococci  and in particular s. epidermidis are the most common cause of foreign body associated infections  such as infections of prosthetic valves, pacemakers, orthopedic prostheses and cerebrovascular shunts. a typical aspect of these fbi are the so-called biofilms consisting of multilayered clusters of cons that are attached to the hard surface and embedded in a slime layer  <cit> .

limited data are available regarding fe-scavenging mechanisms in staphylococcus epidermidis. a cell surface fe-receptor to obtain fe from the receptor-bound transferrin has been reported  <cit>  and another mechanism involves the production of siderophores  <cit> . these low molecular mass ligands chelate free fe and were also shown to release fe from transferrin due to their higher affinity for fe  <cit> . the cell surface receptor and siderophores need to be complemented by another mechanism that mediates the uptake of fe into the bacterial cell. cockayne et al.  <cit>  and hill et al.  <cit>  have suggested that the sitabc operon contains genes that could be involved in fe uptake. the sitabc operon gene products  together constitute an abc-transporter with homology to the multifunctional abc operons involved in adherence and genetic competence in streptococci  <cit> . the products of sita, sitb and sitc also show homology to the products of the mntabc operon  transporter) in s. aureus  <cit> . sita encodes an atp binding protein and sitb codes for a membrane protein. the third open reading frame  encodes a lipoprotein that is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit>  and could act as a ferric siderophore receptor or could be involved in shuttling fe from the transferrin receptor across the cell wall to the cytoplasmic membrane prior to uptake into the cell  <cit> . the genes of the sitabc operon have a single common promoter region, and the expression of sitc is considered representative for the expression of the complete operon  <cit> . sitc is a  <dig> kda cell membrane protein that is very immunogenic and fe-repressible. in vitro studies by cockayne et al.  <cit>  and hill et al.  <cit>  showed that sitc is expressed in a fe-limited environment but not in a fe-rich environment. sitc shows homology to a number of bacterial adhesins like, efaa, scaa and fima in enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus parasanguis, respectively. because sitc remains tethered to the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipid tail, it can function in siderophore dependent and independent fe acquisition pathways. furthermore, it is unlikely that sitc plays a specific role in the adhesion of s. epidermidis because of its limited exposure to the surface  <cit> . according to modun et al.  <cit>  and cockayne et al.  <cit> , cell envelope proteins like sitc could be important virulence factors and could be toxic to mammalian cells. it is interesting that release of significant quantities of these staphylococcal membrane lipoproteins into culture supernatant under fe-restricted growth conditions in vivo and in vitro was observed  <cit> .

located adjacent to this sitabc operon is sirr. sirr is a metallo-dependent repressor that has homology with dtxr and dtxr homologues like mntr in s. aureus, especially since the metal coordination sites are preserved  <cit> . according to hill et al.  <cit>  a putative operator site of sirr could be found in the sequence of the promoter region of the sitabc operon is this operator site is a sir-box, a region of dyad symmetry that overlaps the transcriptional start of sitabc in the promoter region of the operon. it has also been reported by hill et al.  <cit>  that if the genes of the abc transporter are regulated through sirr, they are transcriptionally regulated through sirr in a fe- or mn-concentration dependent manner. intracellular ferrous fe  could attach to the metal coordination sites leading to conformational changes in the fe2+-sirr complex that facilitate binding to a sir-box  <cit> . several sir-boxes are found in the genome of s. epidermidis and sirr might, similar to dtxr and fur-homologues, be a pleiotropic regulator of gene expression in this bacterium  <cit> . according to hill et al.  <cit> , expression of sirr in planktonic  bacteria is not affected by the fe concentration. it remains to be established whether other regulatory mechanisms can affect sirr expression. additionally, it is not yet clear whether expression of sirr is different in sessile  bacteria due to the specific metabolic conditions in biofilm or due to biofilm formation itself.

the expression of genes of the sitabc operon in planktonic bacteria on the other hand is affected by the fe and mn concentration, as has been shown in in vitro studies  <cit> . in these studies, no expression of sitc was observed after  <dig> hrs of growth in a medium with fe or in a fe-free medium with mn  <cit> . earlier studies also indicated that the sitabc operon was expressed in vivo  <cit>  and in vitro  <cit>  in an fe-depleted medium in planktonic bacteria. studies on the mntabc operon and its regulator mntr gene in s. aureus found that the transcription of the operon was affected more by the fe concentration than by the mn concentration  <cit> . according to horsburgh et al.  <cit>  mn plays a role in the protection of a number of bacteria, like bacillus subtilis and s. aureus against oxidative stress.

bacteria in a biofilm display significant phenotypical and genotypical changes  <cit> . because of this, the concentration range of an essential growth factor like fe may be different for sessile and planktonic cell growth  <cit> . in vivo and in vitro, sessile bacteria respond to a more narrow fe concentration range than planktonic bacteria  <cit> .

in this study we examined the expression of the sitabc operon and sirr during biofilm formation by s. epidermidis, in vitro in the presence and the absence of fe and in vivo in a fbi rat model.

RESULTS
effect of fe on growth kinetics and siderophore production
bacteria from an overnight culture of s. epidermidis in rpmi  <dig> depleted of fe,  were resuspended in  <dig> ml frpmi with  <dig> μm fecl <dig>  and without fe at a density equivalent to an od <dig> of approximately  <dig> .

with inocula of  <dig> cells/ml,  the lag phase was shorter and the growth yield was higher in frpmi-fe <dig> than in frpmi. the exponential growth of s. epidermidis in frpmi was slower than in frpmi-fe <dig> . stationary phase was attained after approximately  <dig> hrs, followed by a slight decrease in bacterial density after  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs in both media. with inocula of  <dig> cells/ml, the lag phase also was shorter in frpmi-fe <dig> than in frpmi. the stationary phase was reached sooner for both media in comparison to the lower inoculum and the difference in final bacterial yield  between both media was smaller for  <dig> cells/ml than for  <dig> cells/ml .

the presence of siderophores reflected the presence or absence of fe in the medium. in fe-rich medium  the siderophore production remained at a constant low level over a time period of  <dig> hrs. in the absence of fe, the siderophore production increased and a maximal siderophore production was achieved after  <dig> hrs .

effect of pre-incubation and incubation conditions on the expression of sirr and sitc in planktonic bacteria in vitro
after overnight pre-incubation of s. epidermidis in bhi and resuspension of the bacteria in frpmi-fe <dig> and in frpmi  the expression of sirr remained at a constant low level, independently of the fe-content of the medium. the same results were obtained when frpmi was used for overnight pre-incubation instead of bhi . however, after pre-incubation in frpmi and re-incubation in frpmi versus frpmi with  <dig> μm fecl <dig> , differences in sirr expression were observed . in frpmi-fe <dig> sirr expression increased during the first  <dig> hrs , followed by a decrease  to the level of expression of sirr observed in frpmi.

after  <dig> hrs and for all subsequent time points, a similar expression of sirr was found irrespective of pre-incubation and incubation conditions .

the expression of sitc was considered representative for the expression of the sitabc operon. expression of sitc was examined in function of the time and fe-content of pre-incubation and incubation media. for bacteria that were pre-incubated in bhi and re-incubated in frpmi-fe <dig> and in frpmi, the expression of sitc was not significantly different  . pre-incubation of s. epidermidis in frpmi, followed by resuspension in frpmi and in frpmi-fe <dig>  showed that the expression of sitc was significantly  different between the fe-containing and the fe-free environment during the initial part of the growth curve . after t =  <dig> hrs, expression of sitc was identical in both media . the expression of sitc significantly decreased from t =  <dig> until t =  <dig> hrs both for bacteria in fe-rich and fe-limited medium .

for bacteria pre-incubated in frpmi and incubated in frpmi versus frpmi-fe <dig>  significant differences in the expression of sitc were observed . from t =  <dig> hrs onwards, the expression of sitc in bacteria incubated in frpmi-fe <dig> was more pronounced than in bacteria incubated in frpmi . in addition, bacteria pre-incubated in frpmi had a significantly higher initial expression of sitc than bacteria pre-incubated in bhi .

effect of fe on growth of sessile bacteria
after overnight pre-incubation of bacteria in frpmi, bacteria were incubated in frpmi or frpmi-fe <dig> with added catheters, and real-time quantitative pcr of the gmk housekeeping gene was used to determine bacterial load . in frpmi as well as in frpmi-fe <dig> from  <dig> hrs till  <dig> hrs of incubation, approximately  <dig> bacteria per catheter were measured. after one day and four days of incubation, more sessile bacteria were detected in frpmi-fe <dig> than in frpmi . similar results were obtained after sonication and plating of the catheters .

during these in vitro experiments approximately 107– <dig> planktonic bacteria per ml sample were measured after  <dig> hrs and  <dig> bacteria per ml sample after  <dig> hrs in frpmi; in frpmi-fe <dig>  107– <dig> bacteria per ml were measured after  <dig> hrs and  <dig> after  <dig> hrs .

confocal laser scanning microscopical data confirm the results obtained with gdna quantification. after  <dig> hrs of incubation in frpmi  and frpmi-fe <dig>  clusters of cells and pia production could be visualised. preliminary data indicate higher production of extracellular matrix in frpmi than in frpmi-fe <dig> after  <dig> hrs . the thickness of the biofilm was up to  <dig> μm in some places. after  <dig> day of incubation in frpmi-fe <dig> multilayered clusters of bacteria with extracellular matrix production could be visualized. the overall thickness of the biofilm was  <dig> μm. limited numbers of dead cells were scattered throughout the biofilm. in frpmi fewer bacteria were visible although multilayered bacterial clusters of approximately  <dig> μm with extracellular matrix could also be visualized . preliminary data indicate that after one day more extracellular matrix is present in frpmi than in frpmi-fe <dig> . our data also indicate that a one-day old biofilm is not substantially different from a four-day old biofilm .

expression of sirr and sitc in sessile versus planktonic bacteria in vitro
differences in expression of sirr between planktonic and sessile bacteria were determined after overnight pre-incubation of bacteria in frpmi and incubation in frpmi or frpmi-fe <dig> with added catheters.

initially, a significantly increased expression of sirr was observed both in planktonic and sessile bacteria in frpmi-fe <dig> . this increase was more pronounced in planktonic than in sessile bacteria . after this initial phase, expression was similar, independent of the fe concentration or growth mode of the bacteria. at t =  <dig> hrs the expression of sirr in sessile bacteria in frpmi-fe <dig> increased significantly  in contrast to the expression of sirr in planktonic bacteria in the same medium which decreased .

comparison of the expression of sirr in sessile bacteria after pre-incubation in bhi versus pre-incubation in frpmi and incubation in frpmi and in frpmi-fe <dig> did not show significant differences .

the expression of sitc in sessile versus planktonic bacteria was analysed in bacteria that were pre-incubated overnight in frpmi and subsequently incubated in frpmi or frpmi-fe <dig> with catheters . in frpmi, the expression of sitc in planktonic bacteria  and sessile bacteria  was significantly down regulated during the first  <dig> hrs. after that, sitc expression was up regulated in planktonic bacteria  but not in sessile bacteria. after  <dig> hrs in frpmi the expression of sitc in planktonic bacteria was significantly higher than in sessile bacteria .

in frpmi-fe <dig>  the expression of sitc for planktonic bacteria was initially down regulated until t =  <dig> hrs  followed by a significant increase in expression until t =  <dig> hrs  . for sessile bacteria in frpmi-fe <dig>  the expression of sitc remained constant from incubation until t =  <dig> hrs. after a decrease in expression of sitc, from t =  <dig> hrs until t =  <dig> hrs , expression slowly but significantly increased at t =  <dig> hrs . the expression of sitc differed significantly between sessile and planktonic bacteria in this fe-rich medium from t =  <dig> hrs onwards . the up-regulation of sitc expression as well for sessile as for planktonic bacteria started sooner in frpmi-fe <dig> than in frpmi. the expression of sitc for sessile bacteria in frpmi-fe <dig> at t =  <dig> hrs was also significantly higher  than the expression in frpmi.

the expression of sitc in sessile bacteria after pre-incubation in bhi and incubation in frpmi with and without fe after  <dig> hrs, was the same as observed in sessile bacteria after pre-incubation in frpmi and incubation in frpmi with and without fe .

to obtain confirmation of these results, total rna extracts were analyzed through rna blotting with a dig labelled sitc-specific rna probe. after overnight pre-incubation in frpmi and incubation with catheter fragments in frpmi-fe <dig>  sessile and planktonic samples were randomly chosen at t =  <dig> min, t =  <dig> hrs and t =  <dig> hrs. similar results were obtained in comparison to the real-time quantitative pcr .

the expression of sirr and the sitabc operon in vivo
in vivo, the expression of sirr in sessile bacteria increased immediately after implantation followed by a rapid decrease from  <dig> hrs until  <dig> hrs after implantation. the expression of sirr varied  <dig>  log between t =  <dig> hr and t =  <dig> hrs  and  <dig>  log between t =  <dig> hrs and t =  <dig> hrs . the expression levels at t =  <dig> hrs and t =  <dig> hrs were significantly lower than the expression levels at later time points . after  <dig> hrs the expression stayed at a constant level .

in vivo, the expression of sitc in sessile bacteria increased significantly  from t =  <dig> hr to t =  <dig> hrs. it increased  <dig>  log between t =  <dig> hr and t =  <dig> hrs and  <dig>  log between t =  <dig> hrs and t =  <dig> hrs; the expression level at t =  <dig> hr was significantly lower than the expression level at all subsequent time points  .

in vivo, the expression of sita and sitb was similar to the expression of sitc in sessile bacteria .

the amount of bacteria on the catheter during the two weeks incubation period was quantified via the number of copies of genomic dna . during the two weeks implantation period, the number of bacteria decreased from  <dig>  bacteria per catheter at implantation to  <dig>  bacteria per catheter at explantation two weeks later  

discussion
the impact of fe on fe-regulated genes is difficult to assess because of our incomplete understanding of fe uptake. although several studies have addressed fe uptake by staphylococci, substantial gaps in our understanding of this process remain. an additional difficulty in cons is the existence of differences in siderophore production between different strains. lindsay & riley  <cit>  reported fe-regulated production of siderophores in 31% of  <dig> s. epidermidis isolates and constitutive production of siderophores in most other isolates of s. epidermidis tested. some isolates apparently had no detectable siderophore production under the test conditions used. the genetic background of these differences in siderophore production and the possible link to virulence are not yet established. to determine the nature of siderophore production in the strain used in this study, we investigated growth and siderophore production in fe-depleted and fe-replete conditions. from these data it appears that siderophore production is present and is fe-regulated in the strain 10b that we used in our experiments. further studies on biofilm associated strains with constitutive siderophore production are clearly needed. for this study we only used s. epidermidis 10b because this strain was isolated from a well defined case of catheter infection and has a 100% infection rate in our in vivo foreign body infection model.

in planktonic bacteria in media without fe we found that siderophore production started only after  <dig> hrs of growth. this could be due to the limited sensitivity of the assay, implying a very low siderophore production by the bacteria during the first  <dig> hrs of incubation  <cit> . alternatively and according to somerville et al  <cit> , fe acquisition in s. aureus mostly occurred between post-exponential and stationary phase. extrapolation of these data to our findings for s. epidermidis could explain the lack of siderophore production in frpmi during the first  <dig> hrs of incubation. later studies on s. epidermidis however suggested tca cycle activity, necessitating increased fe import, in the early exponential growth phase of s. epidermidis  <cit> . the amount of siderophore production in planktonic bacteria at a free fe concentration of  <dig> μm was very low. in frpmi supplemented with transferrin bound fe, a significantly higher siderophore production was found than in a medium with a comparable concentration of free fe . although siderophores have a higher affinity for fe than transferrin  <cit> , fe-bound transferrin is less accessible to bacteria than free fe.

the size of the initial inoculum may affect the impact of fe on bacterial growth. for high inocula  the effects of absence or presence of fe were less pronounced. in this study the lowest inoculum used was – due to technical reasons –  <dig> cells/ml. consistent with the findings of matinaho et al.  <cit>  we found that an increase of the free fe concentration up to 1– <dig> μm effectively improved bacterial yield. higher concentrations of fe starting from  <dig> μm fecl <dig> had little additional effect on bacterial yield .

we examined both in vivo and in vitro, the expression of the sitabc operon and sirr over time and the effect of fe on the expression of these genes in s. epidermidis fbi. we have previously shown that our methodology is sufficiently sensitive to document the time-dependent induction in vitro and in vivo of genes involved in biofilm matrix formation such as icaa and icac which are present in the s. epidermidis strain 10b  <cit> . in in vitro cultures, biofilm formation could also be observed via confocal laser scanning microscopy. these data confirmed that after 1– <dig> hrs in vitro, the first bacterial cells were seen to attach to the surface of the catheter and after 4– <dig> hrs in frpmi, with or without fe, an extracellular matrix was formed. after  <dig> day in vitro, multiple dense layers of bacterial cells embedded in an extracellular matrix were observed.

different pre-incubation conditions  were used to differentiate between bacteria with and without induced siderophore production. according to ahn et al.  <cit>  bhi contains approximately  <dig>  μm free fe although the fe content may differ between different lots of bhi. incubation was in frpmi with defined fe concentrations. in our sessile versus planktonic in vitro experiments, using inocula of 107– <dig> cells/ml, the post-exponential phase starts round  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs for frpmi with fe and frpmi respectively. taking into account that siderophore expression in response to fe-depletion takes a few hours to reach maximal levels, we can assume that gene expression patterns in bacteria for the first few hours after re-incubation reflect differences in intracellular fe concentrations. a rapid increase in intracellular fe concentrations might be expected after induction of siderophores due to pre-incubation in a fe-depleted medium and incubation in fe-replete media. no increase can be expected after pre-incubation in frpmi and incubation in frpmi. pre-incubation in bhi will lead to minimal siderophore induction and a slower response to fe-depleted growth conditions upon incubation

in planktonic bacteria pre-incubated in bhi, a low sirr expression was mirrored by a gradually up-regulated expression of sitc, independently of the fe concentration. the level of expression of sitc was higher after overnight pre-incubation in frmpi compared to bacteria grown in bhi. somewhat surprisingly, incubation in  <dig> μm fecl <dig> gave an initial and transiently higher sitc expression than in frpmi. other studies using northern blots  <cit>  found no expression of sitc in fe-replete medium but they studied expression after  <dig> hrs of growth. to validate the results from our in vitro tests, total rna extracts from planktonic and sessile bacteria grown in frpmi-fe <dig> were also analyzed through rna blotting with a dig labelled sitc-specific rna probe. expression of sitc was observed on the rna blot for sessile and planktonic bacteria after  <dig> and  <dig> hrs of growth in a fe repleted medium .

from these data it appears that expression of sirr in planktonic bacteria is transiently increased when high siderophore expression and extracellular fe concentration coexist, probably resulting in high uptake of extracellular fe. our data are also consistent with the regulatory role of sirr in the expression of the sitabc operon in planktonic bacteria. significant variability between this study and previous studies  <cit>  regarding gene expression of sirr in planktonic bacteria could be due to the transient nature of the gene expression. this suggests that single point measurements of gene expression might not be adequate to study the interactions between genes and the impact of environmental conditions. the increase in sitc expression in the exponential/post-exponential phase in frpmi-fe <dig> and frpmi could be due to the need for fe and for fe-acquisition.

several reports indicate that the fe concentration also affects biofilm formation  <cit> . it has been shown  <cit>  that for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the concentration of fe is critical for the shift from a sessile to a planktonic growth mode. according to lyte et al.  <cit> , biofilm formation of s. epidermidis is stimulated by a sufficient acquisition of fe. in sessile bacteria, for most genes observed so far, there is a clear and lasting down-regulation of expression compared to the same genes in planktonic bacteria consistent with the low metabolic activity in biofilm-associated bacteria  <cit> . analysis of the expression patterns of sirr and sitc in vitro showed not the usual down-regulation in sessile bacteria compared to their expressions in planktonic bacteria.

our findings indicate that the expression of sirr in sessile bacteria is less affected by the pre-incubation conditions and the fe content of the incubation medium than in planktonic bacteria.

the inverse relation between expression of sirr and sitc observed in planktonic bacteria was less pronounced in sessile bacteria in vitro. this suggests that other factors might affect sitc expression in addition to sirr or that the interaction between the sitabc-operon and sirr is different in sessile bacteria. according to hill et al.  <cit> , it is possible that sirr functions as a mn2+ rather than a fe2+-dependent repressor. they showed that the transcriptional regulator mntr in s. aureus is responsive to either mn2+ or fe2+ levels  <cit> . further studies will be needed to establish the role of mn2+ on sirr and sitabc in fbi.

according to weinberg  <cit>  sessile bacteria need a much narrower fe concentration range to form a biofilm than planktonic bacteria need during their growth. this implies that the regulatory mechanisms leading to biofilm formation have to be more stringent than in planktonic growth. thus the high expression of sirr in the early phase of biofilm formation could reflect a more efficient regulation of several secondary metabolism associated components. studies have also suggested that higher concentrations of fe are needed for attachment  <cit>  and for the high metabolic activity in the initial phase of biofilm formation  <cit> . in a recent study of fe involvement in biofilm formation by p.aeruginosa, it was found that these bacteria need active fe transport to acquire sufficient intracellular fe for biofilm development  <cit> . deighton & borland  <cit>  and vuong et al.  <cit>  on the other hand have shown that biofilm formation by s. epidermidis is enhanced in a fe depleted environment. quantification of sessile bacteria via real-time quantitative pcr of the gmk gene showed that in the in vitro experiments, the amount of sessile bacteria during the first hours of incubation was higher in frpmi-fe <dig> than in frpmi. however, after approximately  <dig> hrs of incubation, the amount of sessile bacteria was the same for both media. the transiently higher expression of sitc in the early phases of biofilm formation in frpmi-fe <dig> and the hypothesis that the sitabc operon could be a fe transporter are consistent with an increased growth rate. in frpmi-fe <dig>  the decrease in number of bacteria from t =  <dig> hrs until t =  <dig> hrs coincides with a decrease in sitc expression and was followed by an increase in cell numbers until t =  <dig> hrs and a second decrease after t =  <dig> hrs. in frpmi on the other hand, the number of bacteria increased till t =  <dig> hrs and stayed almost constant over the rest of the observation period. in addition, these data are not necessarily in contrast with earlier studies  <cit>  that measured biofilm formation through production of extracellular polysaccharides irrespective of bacterial counts and showed that low fe concentration stimulates extracellular polysaccharide production in exponential as well as stationary phase bacteria  <cit> 

the in vivo situation is different from the in vitro situation because most of the fe is transferrin bound  <cit> . in human serum, the total amount of available fe  is between  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm with free fe at approximately 10- <dig> m  <cit> . preliminary in vitro data showed differences in the expression of sirr and sitabc in sessile and planktonic bacteria in a medium with transferrin bound fe compared to a medium with free fe or without fe . briefly, for planktonic bacteria sirr expression stayed constant over a period of  <dig> hrs in a medium with transferrin bound fe. meanwhile sitc expression was initially high in comparison to fe limited medium or medium with free fe and its expression decreased later on. in sessile bacteria sirr expression decreased after  <dig> hrs of incubation in a medium with transferrin bound fe in contrast to its expression in a medium without fe or with free fe. in our rat model, sirr expression decreased also after  <dig> hrs and  <dig> hrs of incubation in comparison to its expression at other in vivo time points. sitc expression was less dependent on the fe content .

in our in vivo rat model, the amount of the bacteria decreased slightly between implantation and explantation two weeks later, because of detachment of the bacteria from the catheter. the gmk gene was used for bacterial quantification of sessile bacteria during our in vivo and in vitro studies. this was in all phases of the biofilm shown to be the most accurate method  <cit> 

during gene expression studies, the transient expression peak after  <dig> hrs of implantation for all genes could be due to the adaptation to the new environment. the expression of sitabc was not inversely related to the expression level of sirr. high expression of sirr in itself may not necessarily lead to inhibition of the sitabc operon unless sirr is complexed with fe2+. a higher intracellular concentration of sirr might however allow a more stringent and rapid response to changes in the intracellular fe concentration. it remains to be determined how the expression of sirr is up regulated in sessile bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that in planktonic bacteria, expression of sirr is inversely correlated with sitc expression. in sessile bacteria our data suggest that the link between sirr and sitc expression is less stringent. in planktonic bacteria, sirr expression depends on the incubation conditions. in sessile bacteria, the expression of sirr and sitc is elevated in the initial phase of biofilm formation and after a transient decrease remains constant independently of the fe content of the medium.

the different expression patterns of sirr and sitc in sessile versus planktonic bacteria warrant caution in the extrapolation of data obtained in planktonic bacteria to sessile bacteria.
