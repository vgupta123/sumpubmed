BACKGROUND
endometrial cancers  are the most common type of uterine cancer. with more than  <dig>  cases occurring annually worldwide, it has become the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide
 <cit> . the incidence rate of ecs is higher than uterine cervix cancer and ovarian cancer in the united state
 <cit> . these tumors have been broadly classified into two major subtypes i and ii, based on the clinic-pathological characteristics such as prognosis and aggressiveness, as well as, molecular alterations that impact tumor response to therapies
 <cit> . type i tumors are the most frequent subtype which have been linked to obesity, estrogen excess, and low-grade  inflammation. type ii endometrial tumors are serous carcinoma that have been associated with older, non-obese, post-menopausal women, high-grade , and also with worst outcomes. it has been suggested that the molecular-genetic alterations may be responsible for the distinct morphology and biologic behavior of the different subtypes of human ecs
 <cit> . for example, low-grade or early-stage type i tumors may progress to high-grade or late-stage; nonetheless type i and ii cancers appear to be separate entities in most cases, and different molecular abnormalities would result in unique cellular functions and distinctive tumor morphology
 <cit> . therefore, it is crucial to discover with more accuracy the putative molecular signatures of ecs, which should allow for improved detection and monitoring of endometrial tumorigenesis, since such knowledge could be beneficial for early diagnostic, enhanced prognostic, and more effective therapeutic strategies.

ecs are characterized by a variety of genetic alterations and significant gene expression modifications. over the last decade, multiple studies have identified aberrant gene expression of several important genes in ecs, with the mutation frequency varying according to the histological classification
 <cit> . type i tumors are frequently characterized by the loss or altered expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog . pten modulates cell survival and proliferation through its effects on downstream factors, mainly phospholipid phosphatidylinositol -triphosphate  and protein kinase b . pten inactivation leads to a decrease of lipid and protein phosphatase activity and promotes cell cycle progression to the g1/s phase
 <cit> . other genes are linked to abnormalities in type i tumors includingβ-catenin, k-ras and dna-mismatch repair genes
 <cit> . in comparison, type ii tumors have been reported to be associated with abnormalities in tp <dig> and her2/neu <cit> . the gene tp <dig> encodes a tumor suppressor p <dig>  the most frequently mutated protein in cancer. p <dig> prevents cell cycle progression after dna damage, inducing cell arrest and apoptosis through several regulator proteins such as p <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  and rb <dig>  tp <dig> mutations occur as an early event in type ii tumorigenesis and may occur as manifestations of late-stage molecular changes in type i lesions. overexpression of her-2/neu observed in type ii carcinomas has been linked to coding alterations for a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling
 <cit> . although these studies provide important insights into the molecular basis of endometrial cancers, a limited set of well-known cancer genes was obtained from these studies. in fact, until now, a large-scale screen of the gene expression analyses incorporating systematic methods to discover cancer subtypes and their molecular alterations in ecs has not been globally conducted and explored.

recent advances in constructing genetic network approaches have enabled the unprecedented characterization of studying a variety of somatic alterations and gene expression in cancer genomes. therefore, these advances allow connecting the existent gap of understanding the association of individual genes to complex diseases such as cancer by the systematic investigation of the observed relationship between gene products and tumorigenesis. a weighted gene co-expression network approach  has been proposed to reconstruct gene co-expression networks  in terms of large-scale gene expression profiles and as well as for the distinction of centrally located genes  driving key cellular signaling pathways
 <cit> . the wgcna approach provides a functional interpretation in systems biology and leads to new insights into cancer pathophysiology
 <cit> .

here, we aimed to establish a systematic framework for constructing for the first time, the ecs-associated gene co-expression networks and pin-pointing cancer hub genes contributing to endometrial tumorigenesis and progression. this study provides a novel and broad application platform for the identification of cancer gene signatures of ecs tumorigensis and for the discovery of potential new molecular targets for the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of ecs.

RESULTS
systematic framework for identifying cancer hub genes in ecs
in this study, a novel systematic analysis was developed to integrate wgcna and elastic-net analysis to identify cancer hub genes in ecs . this method is divided into three main parts. first, we performed a very large human microarray-based ecs meta-analysis by merging multiple platforms to reveal the differentially expressed genes on  <dig> ec samples properly matched with normal samples. second, we conducted the wgcna analysis to reconstruct ec-associated gene co-expression networks  and discover the cancer hub genes. third, we developed a cancer hub genes-based classifier model to distinguish the phenotypic characteristics of ecs . finally, we used the hub genes as the gene signatures to validate its biological and phenotypic characteristics relevance using 10-fold cross-validation and independent data set validation. figure 
 <dig> presents an overview of approach in this study, and the detailed methods are described in supporting information .

reconstruction of ec-specific gene co-expression network
in the initial analysis, we identified  <dig>  genes having significant expression difference between subjects with cancer and subjects without cancer by applying a 1% fdr . these endometrial cancer-related genes were used to reconstruct the ec-associated co-expression network  and identify a number of modules of high co-expression genes. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  these modules are significantly enriched for biologically important processes that are relevant to cancer, including cell-cycle regulation, antigen processing, immune response, and cell adhesion . among the modules, yellow-colored module  that specifically corresponds to clinical information of ecs, showed a high pearson correlation with phenotypic characteristics of ecs including grade , type  and stage  in ecs. the blue-colored module  was only significantly correlated with the stage of ecs . by contrast, other modules showed a much lower correlation with the phenotypic characteristics of ecs. interestingly, the myellow module was significantly enriched for cell-cycle regulation . conversely, mblue gene ontology categories included antigen processing  and the citric acid  cycle .

identification of cancer hub genes
genes with the highest degree of connectivity within a module  are termed hub genes and are expected to be drivers required for signaling pathways of essential cellular function. to identify the cancer hub genes in the myellow and mblue modules, we estimated the scale connectivity  for each gene and for gene significance  based on its pearson correlation with phenotypic characteristics of ecs  and predicted the frequency  by using the elastic net regression model combined with bootstrap approaches in the modules . we set the weighted cutoff value  to identify cancer hub genes with strongest connections to other genes and to link to phenotypic characteristics of ecs. as a result, we identified  <dig> cancer hub genes with at least  <dig> connections derived from the myellow and mblue modules. these hub genes associated with grade , type  and stage  in the myellow, module. nonetheless,  <dig> hub genes associated with stage including idh3g, ndufv <dig>  atp5b, psmb <dig> and psmb <dig> were identified in the mblue module . figure

pathway analysis of hub genes
this study reconstructed and identified the gene networks of cancer hub genes to search the potential key regulators of endometrial tumorigenesis and to identify regulatory relationships among cancer hub genes. using functional enrichment analysis, we identified three major signaling pathways; cell-cycle regulated networks , antigen processing  and the tca cycle, as the main gene ontology biological processes overrepresented in the gene networks deriving from the cancer hub genes . in the cell-cycle network, bub <dig>  aurkb, cenpa, kif20a, cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  e2f <dig> and fen <dig> seem to regulate distinct co-expression pathways that contributed to mitotic g2-g2/m phase, g2/m checkpoints, and kinesins in type ii ecs, whereas these genes regulate the m phase and mitotic g1-g1/s phase in type i ecs . in addition, the antigen processing and tca cycle networks are regulated by the hub genes idh3g, ndufv <dig>  atp5b, psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  contributing to tumorigenesis in type ii ecs .

cancer hub genes classification based model
this study performed receiver-operator characteristic curve  analysis to assess the predictive accuracy of the cancer hub gene signatures. as follows, an auc  value of  <dig>  indicated that the predictive performance equals chance, while values greater than  <dig>  indicated high predictive capacity. using a strict 10-fold cross-validation, the classification capacity of cancer hub gene signatures proved to be significantly better than random predictability . furthermore, the module showed a substantial capacity to distinguish ecs grade , type  and stage  in independent datasets . strikingly, these hub genes deriving from the co-expression networks of myellow and mblue provided significant predictive power in distinguishing the phenotypic characteristics of ecs.

discussion
in this study, we integrated a large-scale transcriptional profiling of  <dig> ecs datasets to identify appropriate cancer subtypes and biomarkers. our long-term goal is to provide insights into disease biology and diagnostic classification, which may guide early-phase of clinical therapeutic applications. we also determined that co-expression networks reflect causative relationships between different gene-gene interactions. first, this study found that an ec-specific co-expression network majorly regulated the tumorigenesis of ecs. this network not only enriched genes known to play critical roles in cell cycle regulation but also showed significant correlation with grade, type, and stage of ecs. second,  <dig> highly connected hub genes were defined into two ec-associated co-expression networks. detailed and systematic network analysis revealed that these hub genes played roles as major regulators in cell-cycle regulation, kinase modulation, and the development of various tumors. finally, for independent analysis of microarray data as validated data sets, these hub genes can provide excellent diagnostic power in distinguishing grade, type, and stage of ecs. altogether these findings strongly suggest that the role of these hub genes in the ec-associated networks may provide new insights into the underlying biological mechanisms driving the tumorigenesis of ecs.

tumor cell progression is typically associated with aberrant cell-cycle regulation, and this study identified several unique hub genes in the networks associated with the grade of ecs including tp <dig>  bub <dig>  aurkb, cenpa. in agreement with previous reports
 <cit> , the disruption of these hub genes was observed in a variety of human tumors and often correlates with tumorigenesis. for example, bub <dig> has been suggested to play a direct role in the suppression of p53-mediated cell death via physical interaction with p <dig> at kinetochores in response to mitotic spindle damage
 <cit> . altered expression of bub <dig> is associated with therapy failure and death in patients with multiple types of cancer
 <cit> . fu et al. 
 <cit>  reported a possible mechanism on the roles of aurora kinases in mitosis and tumorigenesis. they found that overexpression of aurka and aurkb disruption overrides spindle checkpoint, resulting in the aneuploidy or polyploidy that occurs during cell division. when cells lose the normal function of p <dig>  they enter mitosis and become aneuploid, which is considered a cancerous manifestation.

recently, up-regulation of bub <dig> gene has been linked to the inhibition of p53-dependent senescence, hyper-activation of aurkb and phosphorylation of cenp-a, and might be considered as a potential oncogene in driving the aneuploidiation and tumorigenesis
 <cit> . interestingly, this study found bub <dig> not only highly connected with other genes in the co-expression network, but also significantly correlated with the transformation of ecs. therefore, bub <dig> gene seems to modulate the expression of tens or hundreds of genes suggesting that it might allow undifferentiated cancer cells to overcome apoptotic checkpoints favoring aberrant progression through mitosis.

previous reports suggested that pten mutations occur early in the neoplastic process of type i ecs and co-exist frequently with other mutations in the pik/akt pathway
 <cit> , yet type ii ecs showed an alteration of the e2f–retinoblastoma protein–p <dig> pathway by mutations of p <dig> and p <dig> <cit> . in this study, several unique hub genes  were identified in the co-expression network associated with the subtype of ecs, which were linked to the pten and p16-associated pathway. the cell division gene, cdc <dig>  is required for the cell cycle g1-to-s transition. wu et al. 
 <cit>  have identified that cdc <dig> is the putative pten target and demonstrated a causal linkage between cdc <dig> and pten in metastatic human prostate cancer. they indicated that the regulation of cdc <dig> expression by pten is mediated through the e2f transcriptional factor and the e2f <dig> protein. furthermore, overexpression of aurkb has been suggested to compromise the tumor suppressor function of p <dig> <cit> . the gene prc <dig>  encodes one of the polycomb-group proteins, and is involved in cytokinesis. of note, the prc <dig> and prc2/3/ <dig> proteins can induce the repression of the pten transcription via binding to the pten promoter region in leukemic cells
 <cit> , while kif20a is known to be controlled by the e2f–retinoblastoma protein–p <dig> pathway, and is linked to tumor aggressiveness in human hepatocellular carcinomas
 <cit> . taken together, it appears that this gene-signature is commonly linked to pten, pik/akt and e2f–retinoblastoma protein–p <dig> pathway, and may be marginally associated with the subtype of ecs.

cancer stage is the most import indicator for selecting an appropriate cancer treatment option for a patient. in this study, two co-expression networks were significantly correlated with the stage of ecs. these two network-regulated signaling events contributed to cell-cycle regulation, antigen processing and tca cycle, respectively. from the cell-cycle regulation network,  <dig> hub genes were identified including bub <dig>  fen <dig>  kif <dig>  cdc <dig> and prc <dig>  bub <dig> and cdc <dig> are involved in the m phase of mitotic cell cycle and dna replication, and play critical roles in the cell-cycle regulation
 <cit> . altered expression of cell-cycle associated protein like bub <dig> and cdc <dig> may lead to chromosomal instability. bub <dig> and cdc <dig> are important regulators of the anaphase-promoting complex 
 <cit> . apc’s function is to trigger the transition from metaphase to anaphase by tagging critical cell-cycle proteins for degradation, and maintaining genomic stability in a normal manner. bub <dig> can directly phosphorylate the apc’s co-activator cdc <dig>  leading to the decreased activity of apc, which determines the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. the overexpression of bub <dig> or cdc <dig> induces misregulation of apc, and is associated with the chromosomal instability and poor outcomes in breast cancer patients
 <cit> . kif <dig> belongs to the kinesin family, and it is part of the central spindle in a complex that clusters prc <dig> and aurkb together at the spindle midzone to enable anaphase in dividing cells and regulation of central spindle assembly
 <cit> . abnormal regulation of these genes may lead to the chromosomal instability, thereby promoting tumor development and progression.

the pathway of mhc class i presentation is an important mechanism in determining whether tumors are able to evade immune response. down-regulation of mhc class i has been described in ovary and cervix malignancies. abnormal expression of mhc class i genes has been linked to the advanced stage of disease and poor survival in ovarian cancer
 <cit> . recently, a large cohort study of patients with endometrial cancer indicated that down-regulation of mhc class i expression in endometrial cancer patients are correlated to late-stage ecs
 <cit> . in this study, we identified a group of hub genes associated with the stage of ecs deriving from the mhc class i co-expression network. these hub genes, psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  were found to significantly regulate the network of antigen processing and to contribute to class i mhc mediated processing. furthermore, we also discovered  <dig> hub genes  associated with the tca cycle. no other study to date has reported that these hub genes might be associated with cancer, but recent studies have indicated that the alterations in the tca cycle enzymes may favor tumorigenesis by impacting on cellular redox state and overall cell metabolism
 <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these hub genes could be involved with tumor progression.

to identify the signaling pathway through which hub genes regulated the co-expression network in the progression of ecs, we compared the gene co-expression networks between type i  and type ii ecs  of ecs. in the cell-cycle regulation network, type ii ecs displayed a distinct pathway when compared with type i ecs. however, bub <dig>  aurkb, cdc <dig>  cenpa and kif20a seemed to be critical regulators for the co-expression network in type ii compared to type i ecs. among these genes, bub <dig> may play a key role in regulating these genes to promote tumor formation. the overexpression of bub <dig> regulates aurkb, cenpa, cdc <dig> and kif20a in a variety of human cancers
 <cit> . furthermore, from the antigen processing and tca cycle co-expression networks, we found that the network regulated tca cycle through the co-regulation of idh3g, ndufv <dig> and atp5b, and linked to the pathway of cass i mhc antigen processing key players were psmb <dig> and psmb <dig> in type ii compared to type i ecs. expression of these genes in type ii ecs may facilitate the identification of signaling pathways contributing to tumor progression.

CONCLUSIONS
this study used a novel systematic framework to identify two co-expression networks associated with ecs tumorigenesis based on large-scale human microarray data. in addition, a number of novel hub genes in these two co-expression networks were identified contributing to three signaling pathways: cell-cycle regulation, antigen processing and tca cycle, and presented a high predictive power in distinguishing grade, type and stage of ecs. although type i and type ii ecs shared similar genetic information, several critical hub genes were identified that may contribute to progression of ecs. together, these findings provided a clearer and broader picture of the signaling pathways regulated by co-expression networks contributing to ecs. furthermore, the characterization of these hub genes might infuse novel insights into the identification of novel clinical markers and potential therapeutic targets for ecs.
