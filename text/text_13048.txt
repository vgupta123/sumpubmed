BACKGROUND
viruses are small infectious agents, which are found wherever there is a life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved
 <cit> . there are millions of virus types
 <cit> . wherein, those virus species which have been reported were sorted into dsdna, ssdna, dsdna-rt, ssrna-rt, dsrna, ssrna and ssrna viruses based on their genome types; they can also be sorted into algae, archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, plants, protozoa and vertebrates viruses based on the general host categories according to the ictv 
 <cit> . these viruses can infect all types of organisms including archaea, bacteria, plants and animals
 <cit> . many common human diseases are caused by viruses, such as common cold, influenza, chickenpox, cold scores, etc. in addition, many serious diseases such as ebola, aids, avian influenza and sars are also caused by viruses. what's more, many genotypes of viruses are responsible for cancers, for example, human papillomavirus, hepatitis b virus, hepatitis c virus, epstein-barr virus, kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human t-lymphotropic virus, and so on . though there are three main theories on the origin of virus: regressive, cellular and coevolution origin theory, it is still unclear how viruses originated because they do not like other organisms forming fossils
 <cit> . so studying viruses via molecular information has been the most useful means in investigating how they arose and evolved
 <cit> . success of viral genome researches will promote our understandings and solutions of numerous problems, including their origin, evolution, infection mechanism, disease treatment, etc. the genome sizes  of viruses vary greatly between species. the smallest viral genomes — the ssdna circoviruses, family circoviridae — code for only two proteins and have a genome size of only  <dig> kb; the largest — miniviruses have genome sizes of over  <dig>  mb and code for over one thousand proteins
 <cit> . two main mechanisms have been implicated in changes of genome size: one is the accumulation of transposable elements
 <cit> ; the other is the accumulation of tandemly repetitive sequences
 <cit> .

simple sequence repeats , also known as microsatellites, generally defined as simple sequences of 1– <dig> nucleotides that are repeated multiple times and are present in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome
 <cit> . ssrs are ubiquitous and highly abundant in eukaryotic
 <cit>  and prokaryotic genomes
 <cit> . dna repeats are primarily expanded by three models: replication, repair and recombination
 <cit> . meiotic recombination plays a key role in the maintenance of sequence diversity in the human genome, and ssrs have been reported to be hot spots for recombination as well as sites for random integration
 <cit> . thus, alterations in ssrs lie at the center of dna evolution and sequence diversity that drives adaptation; on the other hand, changes in repetitive sequences can result in deleterious effects on gene expression and function, leading to diseases
 <cit> . the instability of ssrs was identified to be a pathway to lead to colorectal cancer
 <cit> . it is now accepted that unstable maintenance of microsatellites occurs in about 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers
 <cit> . microsatellite instability is also frequently associated with other diseases such as ovarian cancers, malignant tumors of endometrium
 <cit> , small intestine
 <cit> , stomach
 <cit> , skin
 <cit>  and brain, etc. the features of microsatellite instability observed in bacteria, yeast, mice and man can provide general clues as to how genomes evolve and how certain instability could contribute to human disease
 <cit> . some pathogens use ssrs in a strategy that counteracts the host immune response by increasing the antigenic variance of the pathogen population
 <cit> .

genome sequences with diverse lengths make it possible to investigate the relationship between genome size and accumulation of ssrs in all virus genera whose complete genome sequences have been reported. therefore, scatter plots and regression analysis were performed to survey the correlation between repetitiveness  and genome size. distributions of different repeat classes were also surveyed among virus genomes of various sizes. while, relative abundance and relative density were examined to make the ssrs comparison parallel among differently sized species genomes; principal component analysis  was designed to investigate which repeat class made a greater contribution to the variance among virus species as well as the relationships between repeat classes.

methods
genome sequences
the eighth report of ictv  provided information on  <dig> orders,  <dig> families,  <dig> subfamilies,  <dig> genera and  <dig> virus species
 <cit> ; wherein  <dig> genera have been reported on complete genome sequences on ncbi and one typical species was identified as the representative for each genus according to the listing in taxonomic order . therefore, the  <dig> genome sequences were selected as samples for the analysis of relationship between ssrs distribution and genome size in the level of the whole virus. all the genome sequences were downloaded in both genbank and fasta formats from the ncbi . sequences obtained include dna and rna, so both t and u bases were represented with t. some genomes were segmented, multipartite and consist of two or more segments with various sizes .

ssrs extraction
ssrs were identified and localized using the software ssr identification tool , which identifies perfect di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats. we have considered only those repeats, wherein the motif was repeated more than  <dig> times for further analysis. mononucleotide repeats  were identified using the tool imex , which can extract perfect microsatellites as well as imperfect microsatellites. here we presented the data for all perfect repeat types. no distinctions between the occurrence of repeats in coding and noncoding regions were made, the rationale for this decision was that the coding regions often account for the large proportion ; while the sequences of noncoding regions are usually very short; moreover, the overlap phenomenon is very common in virus genomes, and many of the details were presented in
additional file  <dig> 

relative abundance and relative density
these total numbers have been normalized by using relative abundance and relative density of ssrs to allow the comparisons to be parallel among genome sequences with different sizes. relative abundance was calculated by dividing the number of ssrs by kilo base pair  of sequences; and relative density  was calculated by dividing the total sequences analyzed  by the number of base pairs of sequence contributed by each ssr.

pca
principal components analysis  is a well known statistical technique which has wide ranging applications. the main goal of pca is to reduce the dimensionality by decomposing the total variances observed in an original data set. that is to say, we use pca method to transform a set of original variables into a set of new and uncorrelated variables. the mathematic principle of pca method lies in coordinate conversion. consequently, pc  is a linear combination of the original variables.

mathematical model. if the sample size isn, and each sample has p observed index , we can get the following matrix of the original dataset:

 x=x11x12…x1px21x22…x2p⋮⋮⋮xn1xn2…xnp=x <dig> x <dig> …,xp 

wherein,
xi=x1ix2i⋮xni,i= <dig> ,…,p.

making linear combinations using the p variables  of the original data matrix x:

 y={y1=e11x1+e21x2+…+ep1xpy2=e12x1+e22x2+…+ep2xp…yp=e1px1+e2px2+…+eppxp 

hence,
yi=e1ix1+e2ix2+…+epixp,i= <dig> ,…,p

here, yi is the principal component, but it must meet the following conditions: 
e1i2+e2i2+…+epi2= <dig> i= <dig> ,…,p;  there is no correlation between yi and yj ;  the variance of yi is the maximum during 
yi,yi+ <dig> …,yp; 
vary1+vary2+…+varyp=varx1+varx2+…+varxp

geometric meaning. supposing that the sample contains n individuals, each individual has two variables x <dig>   x <dig>  and in addition, variables subject to the normal distribution. that is, we discuss the geometric meaning of pca by using bivariate normally distributed variables. therefore, scatters of sample are roughly distributed in the shape of ellipse . then orthogonally rotate the original plane rectangular coordinates composed of x <dig> and x <dig> with an angle θ, thus, two original correlated variables  were transformed into two integrated and uncorrelated variables , and the correlation between the original and new axes is as following:

 {f1=x1cosθ+x2sinθf2=−x1sinθ+x2cosθ 

because the variance of the original variables is greater in y <dig> axis than in y <dig> axis, so a minimum of information will be lost if integrated variable y <dig> is used for replacing all original variables. hence, y <dig> is defined as the first principal component; in contrast, the variance of variables is smaller in y <dig> axis, and it can explain minor information relative to y <dig>  so y <dig> is called the second principal component.

RESULTS
to obtain an expansive and unbiased data set, all virus genera with complete genome sequences reported on ncbi were scanned for ssrs analysis; wherein, one typical species was selected as the representative for each genus according to the ictvdb . therefore, we analyzed perfect ssrs over  <dig> bp long, from the  <dig> completely sequenced virus genomes. while, the genome size varies widely, ranging from  <dig> bp ssrna- <dig>  hepatitis delta virus, nc_001653) to  <dig> bp  .

relationship between ssrs and genome size
we constructed two sets of scatter plots and then performed regression analysis of ssrs  versus complete genome size for all analyzed viruses to examine the relationship between ssrs and genome size. above all, scatter plots were made, in which, genome size was taken as an independent variable, and all analyzed data were split into two groups  to make the scatters and curves natural and visible ; and then  <dig> curves  were fitted according to their respective mathematical models by using the software spss  <dig> . parameter estimates and visual inspection showed that goodness fit of data varies greatly to different models; nevertheless, curves with the best goodness of fit were picked out for correlation analysis between ssrs  and genome size . the number of repeat arrays varies from  <dig> in nodamura virus genome ssrna-36) to  <dig> in amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus 'l' genome  . the power function model provides the best fitted values towards all studied ssrs occurrence and genome size by regression analysis, and results display a very strong and significant positive relationship between the occurrence of ssrs and genome size clearly  . power function and cubic model best fit for the data of genome >  <dig> bp and ≤  <dig> bp group, respectively . clearly, the ssrs occurrence is strongly, significantly and positively related to the genome size in both genome >  <dig> bp  and ≤  <dig> bp  group. especially in the group of genome ≤  <dig> bp, the values of ssr occurrences fluctuate with a relatively narrow range. an exceptional case is worth noting. one point of the scatter plot locating far above the fitted curve represents the value of ssrs in amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus 'l' genome  with the size of  <dig> bp, in which the ssrs occurrence is a total of  <dig>  far more than ssrs in any other analyzed virus genome.

the length of ssrs varies from  <dig> bp in nodamura virus genome ssrna-36) to  <dig> bp in amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus 'l' genome ; and the percentage of ssrs varies from  <dig> % in nodamura virus genome ssrna-36) to  <dig> % in amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus 'l' genome  . similarly, we investigated the correlation between ssrs length and genome size. figure
 <dig> showed that the distribution of ssrs length is similar to the ssrs occurrence in differently-sized genomes, and it indicated that ssrs length is also significantly and positively correlated with the genome size to all analyzed data , to genome > <dig> bp group  and to genome ≤  <dig> bp  group. likewise, amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus 'l' genome  shows features out of the ordinary, with the total ssrs length of  <dig> bp and ssrs percentage of  <dig> %, occupying the number-one spot in length and percentage of ssrs among all analyzed virus genomes. except that, other points float up and down the curve with a small range . the above results indicated that genome size is an important factor in affecting repetitiveness of microsatellites in viruses.

relationship between repeat class and genome size
we surveyed the distribution of different ssr classes in virus genomes to investigate the relationship between repeat classes  and genome sequence length. the data of genome size <  <dig> kb group are not in our consideration here, because too small sample sizes lead to statistical insignificance. data presents such a trend that, for the same repeat class, the ratio of genomes with corresponding ssrs to all genomes increases with the genome sequence growing, although the genome distribution is uneven among different genome ranges . for example, the ratio of genomes with hexanucleotide ssrs is  <dig> in group of 2 ~  <dig> kb, and it is  <dig> % in 5 ~  <dig> kb,  <dig> % in 10 ~  <dig> kb,  <dig> % in 30 ~  <dig> kb and  <dig> % in >  <dig> kb group, respectively. for the same range of genome sizes, tendency seems to be that the ratio decreases with the increase of the length of repeat unit. for example, in the genome range of 10 ~  <dig> kb, the ratio is 100% , 100% ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. observed value per virus genome showed a rising trend with the increase of the genome sequence. additionally, long repeat units such as penta- and hexa- ssrs were rarely, or even not, observed in small genomes, and certain repeat unit class distributed in genomes with a certain range of sequence length. all mono- and di- repeats were observed in analyzed genomes except duck hepatitis b virus , cryphonectria parasitica mitovirus  <dig> ssrna-4) and nodamura virus ssrna-36) in which mono- repeats were not found; tri- repeats seemed to widely distribute in all virus genomes; and tetra- ssrs, as a common component, consist in genomes with size more than  <dig> kb ; in contrast, it is rarely observed in genomes with size <  <dig> kb; and genomes containing penta- and hexa- ssrs are not more than 50% in <  <dig> kb group. moreover, the number of tetra-, penta- and hexa- ssrs is very small in genome range of <  <dig> kb . results indicated that the correlation is strong between length of repeat unit and genome size. the longer the genome sequence, the longer repeat units. for the same repeat unit class such as mononucleotide ssrs, the number of ssrs increases with the genome length increasing. it confirmed a preference that ssrs tend to accumulate in larger virus genomes.

 <dig> genome number, e.g., the number of genomes is  <dig> with the size of 2 ~  <dig> kb;  <dig> genome number with corresponding repeat class, e. g., there are  <dig> virus genomes from which mononucleotide ssrs were extracted in the genome range of 2 ~  <dig> kb;  <dig> ratio of g. n. r. to geno. no.;  <dig> observed value of corresponding ssrs, e. g., a total of  <dig> mononucleotide repeat motifs were extracted from the genome range of 2 ~  <dig> kb.

relative abundance and relative density of ssrs
because of the irregular sizes of analyzed virus genomes, we calculated the relative abundance and relative density of ssrs to make the comparison of ssrs abundance parallel among differently-sized genomes. frequency of virus genomes with the ssrs relative abundance of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  is quite high with the value of  <dig> . wherein,  <dig> genomes  were found to have the ssrs relative abundance of  <dig>  ~  <dig> . however, genomes with the ssrs relative abundance of <  <dig>  and >  <dig>  are relatively fewer  . paralleling, frequency of genomes is relatively high in the ssrs relative density range of 12 ~  <dig> bp/kb with the genome number of  <dig> , and  <dig> genomes  have the ssrs relative density among 16 ~  <dig> bp/kb; moreover,  <dig> genomes  have the ssrs density of 20 ~  <dig> bp/kb . the relationship between ssrs relative abundance, relative density and genome size were investigated respectively. scatter plots showed that the correlations between the ssrs relative abundance and genome size and between the relative density and genome size are quite weak . the results indicated that the genome size has slightly affected the relative abundance and relative density of ssrs in virus genomes. chen et al.
 <cit>  also found that the relative abundance and relative density of ssrs were not significantly related to genome size. on the contrary, ssrs are distributed in the virus genomes with a certain proportion.

pca applying to ssrs study
pca was used to examine which factor primarily lead to differences in ssrs abundance among the virus species. the sample with the size of  <dig>  contains  <dig> variables . di- ssrs is the most and hexa- ssrs is the least on average, but the standard deviation is very large for each repeat unit class among the virus genomes . even so, correlation is still strong and extremely significant between the original variables . the results showed that the two principal components with eigenvalues of  <dig>  and  <dig>  together can account for  <dig> % of all differences of ssrs abundance among viruses. wherein, the first component can account for  <dig> % and the second  <dig> % of all variances, respectively. other components played a less important role in explaining the differences of ssrs abundance among virus genomes. the comparison of the parameters' coefficients for the first and second components showed that the first component has a major loading on the difference of ssrs during analyzing genomes . the results indicated that the ssrs differences among virus genomes are mainly due to the following parameters: mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-. wherein, the variable of di- affects the differences of ssrs among virus genomes most strongly with the loading of  <dig> , followed by tri-, mono- and tetra-. in this component, penta- and hexa- played relative minor role in explaining the differences of ssrs among virus genomes. in the second component, hexa- with high positive coefficient and tetra-, penta- with negative coefficients showed different effects on ssrs abundance. in this component, hexa- played the most important role in explaining differences of ssrs abundance. overall, the results of pca indicated that di- affected the ssrs variances among virus genomes most strongly, followed by tri-, mono- and tetra-; and then by hexa-; penta- played the weakest role in influencing the variances of ssrs abundance among viruses.

all results of kaiser-meyer-olkin , bartlett's and scree test indicated that it is significantly meaningful to analyze our data using pca . the kmo measure with the value of  <dig>  is close to  <dig>  and bartlett's test  approximates to  <dig>  and scree plot displays the "cliff" and the "screes" vividly . moreover, the correlation is strong between the original variables .

preference of ssrs
ssrs vary greatly in repeat classes and motifs among analyzed virus genomes . dinucleotide ssrs accounts for the largest proportion of  <dig> % in all repeat classes, followed by mono-  and trinucleotide ssrs . both a and t mono- ssrs are much more than c and g ssrs, and they make up about  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all ssrs in analyzed viruses respectively. at/ta ssrs predominate in dinucleotide repeats with the proportion of  <dig> %, and it is slightly more than a and t mono- ssrs ; other di- repeat motifs are neck and neck in occurrence, but they are all higher than c and g mono- ssrs . repeat motif group of aat/ata/att/taa/tat/tta showed the highest percentage and agt/act/cta/gta/tac/tag showed the lowest percentage in tri- ssrs. tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide ssrs are rare, accounting for  <dig> % more or less. it's abnormal that penta- ssrs are less than hexa- ssrs with  <dig> %, which is approximately only one third of hexa- ssrs. however, it is usually assumed that the longer repeat unit, the lower frequency it occurred. repeat motifs differ greatly among different virus genomes .

discussion
these analyses extend those in chen et al.
 <cit>  in three ways: firstly, by using larger sample such that these analyses cover almost all taxonomic virus genera; secondly, by making the data more comprehensive because the genome size varies greatly, ranging from  <dig> bp ssrna- <dig>  hepatitis delta virus, nc_001653) to  <dig> bp , ; and thirdly, by applying statistically significant methods. the above extension made it possible to investigate the relationship between repetitiveness of microsatellites and genome size more fully and deeply.

the previous analysis
 <cit>  simply considered the correlation between microsatellites and genome size based on relatively small sample with  <dig> complete hepatitis c virus  genomes, and they found that the number of ssrs is weakly correlated with genome size. we believe that chen's result is lacking of statistical significance due to the relatively small sample size and uniform genome length. here, the sample made up of  <dig> representative virus genome sequences was designed to investigate the relationship between ssrs and genome size on the level of the whole virus. the result of our data showed a very strong and significant positive relationship between the occurrence, or length of ssrs and genome size with the value of r2 =  <dig> , p <  <dig>   and r2 =  <dig> , p <  <dig>  , respectively. that is, the longer the virus genome sequence, the more ssrs extracted. hancock
 <cit>  confirmed that the simple sequence repeats were positively and significantly correlated with the genome size in both archaea and eubacteria, and ssrs accumulate preferentially in organisms with larger genomes. moreover, there is evidence proved that short ssrs  exist in reduced genomes, but long ssrs  consist in larger genomes in prokaryotes
 <cit> . the overall level of repetition in genomes is related to genome size and to the degree of repetition, and the entire genome accepts simple sequences in a concerted manner when its size increases
 <cit> . a relative scarcity of repeating dna is a major factor in causing the relatively compact size of the avian genome
 <cit> . what's more, differences in genome size account for approximately 10% of the variance in genomic repetition in archaea and eubacteria
 <cit> , suggesting that other factors can also play important roles. dna structure and base-stacking determined the number and length distributions of microsatellites in vertebrate genomes over evolutionary time
 <cit> . hosts are responsible for the variances of ssrs content to a certain degree. for example, with the similar genome size, viruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates tend to be higher than viruses attacking bacteria in ssrs content, relative abundance and relative density of ssrs overall . this can be explained by the following statements. genomes of reptiles are estimated to consist of about 30-50% repeats, birds have been estimated to consist of 15-20% of repeats
 <cit> , mus musculus of  <dig> %
 <cit> , and  <dig> % of human genome were occupied by repeats
 <cit> . while ssr tracts make up  <dig> % of the e. coli genome
 <cit> , significantly less than vertebrates'. ssrs have been reported to be hot spots for recombination as well as sites for random integration
 <cit> . thus, the increase of viral ssrs content is maybe due to combining partial genome sequences of hosts in the process of infecting vertebrates and invertebrates. as we know, hosts evolved a number of defense systems in response to the challenge from parasites. meanwhile, the parasites evolved multiple counter-defense mechanism as well under the selection pressure from hosts. bacteria have developed crispr/cas  immune system to defend against bacteriophages by cleaving their dna
 <cit> . antagonistic coevolution between bacteria and their ubiquitous parasites, bacteriophage , is well known
 <cit> . the genomic regions of crispr/cas are hot spot of recombination, and crispr/cas modules underwent rapid evolution in natural environments because of recurrent selection pressure exerted by coevolving viruses
 <cit> . meanwhile, viruses may combine partial crispr/cas sequence in response to the counter-defense of bacteria. therefore, it is no coincidence that ssrs content is high in both viruses that infect vertebrates and invertebrates and these hosts themselves. the recombination enhanced the virus's ability of infection and anti-immunity to a certain extent. evolutionarily speaking, it is the result of selection in the process of interaction between viruses and hosts. it has proposed that reduced genome size represents an adaptation to the high rate of oxidative metabolism in birds, which results primarily from the demands of flight, and the relatively small genome size of birds in general may reflect the selective pressure to minimize the amount of repetitive dna
 <cit> .

overall, the longer genome sequence, the stronger capability the genome holding long ssrs. each type of repeat unit is distributed in a certain length range of genomes. mono- and di- ssrs were observed in almost all analyzed virus genomes; tri- repeats appeared to widely distribute in all virus genomes but it's number is obviously less than mono- and di- ssrs; tetra- ssrs as a common component consist in genomes with size more than  <dig> kb . in contrast, it is relatively rare in genomes with the size <  <dig> kb; genomes containing penta- and hexa- ssrs are not more than 50% in <  <dig> kb group. moreover, the number of tetra-, penta- and hexa- ssrs is very small . dinucleotide and trinucleotide ssrs were observed in all analyzed hiv genomes , but almost no tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide ssrs were found
 <cit> . tetranucleotide ssrs are contained in  <dig> % of the analyzed potyvirus genomes , but the number of tetranucleotide ssrs is small
 <cit> . the data of tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide ssrs are also rare in mycoplasma, but they are relatively sufficient in bacterial
 <cit> , fungal
 <cit> , plant
 <cit> , vertebrates
 <cit>  and human
 <cit> . those results confirmed that ssrs distribution is closely related to the genome size, indeed. the accumulation of simple sequence repeats would be attributed to the results of selection in the process of evolution. it has been well known that viruses such as influenza virus, hepatitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus  have a higher mutation rate to resist drugs, vaccines and so on during the process of replication and  recombination, which is one of the reasons for curing flu, hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  with difficulty. moreover, viruses lack complete repair mechanisms. therefore, long ssrs can be poorly found in viruses. in the opinion of mrázek et al.
 <cit> , small genomes have a strong negative selection against long ssrs due to their strong constraints against expansion.

CONCLUSIONS
genome size is an important factor in affecting the occurrence and the total length of ssrs, moreover, there is a positive correlation between them. additionally, hosts are also responsible for the variances of ssrs content to a certain degree. for example, with similar genome sizes, viruses infecting vertebrates and invertebrates tend to be higher than viruses attacking bacteria in ssrs content, relative abundance and relative density of ssrs, overall. we inferred that maybe viruses combined partial genome sequences of hosts in infecting, resulting in relative large genome and high content of ssrs. evolutionarily speaking, it is the result of selection in the process of interaction between viruses and hosts. virus is a group of parasite, so studying of ssrs in viruses is helpful to the research of many etiopathogenesis of its hosts.
