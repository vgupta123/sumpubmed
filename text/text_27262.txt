BACKGROUND
seed germination is controlled by multiple endogenous and environmental factors  <cit> , which are integrated to trigger this developmental process at the right time. two plant hormones play important roles in seed germination: gibberellins , which have an inductive effect, and abscissic acid , which inhibits the process  <cit> . several physical factors affect seed germination, such as light, temperature and water potential. the effect of light is mediated mainly by the photoreceptor phytochrome b   <cit> , and the levels of ga and aba are oppositely modulated by light, which induces ga biosynthesis and causes a reduction in aba levels  <cit> , <cit> . among the regulators involved in phyb-mediated ga-induced seed germination in arabidopsis, the bhlh transcription factor phytochrome interacting factor 3-like  <dig>  represents the master repressor  <cit> . in seeds kept in the darkness, pil <dig> activates transcription of ga-insensitive  and repressor of ga1- <dig>   <cit> , two nuclear-localized della transcriptional regulators that repress ga-mediated responses and are rapidly degraded in response to ga  <cit> – <cit> . indeed, it has been shown that in arabidopsis all della proteins are under negative control by ga and the proteasome  <cit> . accordingly, gain-of-function della mutants show ga-insensitive phenotypes , whereas loss-of-function mutations result in ga-hypersensitive phenotypes   <cit> .

the della proteins represent a subfamily of the gras plant transcription factors, and are characterized by the n-terminal della domain. in arabidopsis there are five della genes: the above mentioned gai and rga, and rga-like  <dig> , <dig> . an insertional mutagenesis approach enabled cloning of arabidopsis gai by isolation of a ds transposon-mutated gai-t <dig> allele  <cit> , while rga was identified by loss-of-function mutations  <cit>  and shown to encode a protein closely related to gai  <cit> . gai and rga were shown to have overlapping functions in repressing many growth processes, such as leaf expansion, stem elongation, floral initiation and seed germination  <cit> , <cit> . moreover, double mutant seeds have a higher germination rate than the wild-type ones in response to increasing red  light fluences  <cit> .

as of other della proteins involved in seed germination, rgl <dig> also plays a negative key role: genetic data clearly showed that only a combination of rga and rgl <dig> or gai-t <dig> and rgl <dig> mutant alleles could restore seed germination in a ga1- <dig> background  <cit> .

we have previously shown that the dof transcription factor dag <dig>  is a repressor of seed germination in arabidopsis: dag <dig> knock-out mutant seeds require lower ga and r light fluence rates than wild-type seeds to germinate  <cit> – <cit> . we have also pointed out that dag <dig> acts in the phyb-mediated pathway: dag <dig> expression is reduced in seeds irradiated for 24 hours with r light, and this reduction is dependent on pil5; in pil <dig> mutant seeds dag <dig> expression is reduced irrespective of light conditions, indicating that dag <dig> acts downstream of pil5; moreover, dag <dig> negatively regulates ga biosynthesis by directly repressing the ga biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig> <cit> . very recently, we demonstrated that gai cooperates with dag <dig> in repressing atga3ox <dig>  and that it directly interacts with dag <dig>  <cit> .

in order to further clarify the role of dag <dig> in phyb-mediated seed germination, we focus here on the functional relationship between dag <dig>  rga and gai in the control of this process. we provide genetic and phenotypic evidence suggesting different roles of the two della proteins in seed germination and with respect to dag <dig> 

RESULTS
the gai-t <dig> and rga <dig> mutant alleles show different seed germination phenotypes
it has been reported that concurrent inactivation of both gai and rga increases the seed germination potential: gai-t6rga <dig> double mutant seeds require less r light fluences than wild-type ones to germinate  <cit>  - a phenotype that is reminiscent of dag <dig> mutant seeds, which need a fluence rate six times lower than wild-type to germinate  <cit> . we compared the seed germination properties of stored  gai-t <dig>  rga <dig>  double mutant gai-t6rga <dig> and col- <dig> wild-type seeds, under phyb-dependent germination conditions  <cit> , <cit> . we also assessed the germination properties under white light and in the dark, with or without stratification.

under phyb-dependent conditions, in the absence of stratification, germination rate of rga <dig> mutant seeds  was only 38%, compared with almost 100% of gai-t <dig> and gai-t6rga <dig> seeds and of wild-type seeds. instead, after stratification, all mutant lines and wild-type seeds germinated completely .

under white light the only substantial difference in the germination rate of stratified seeds was observed at 24 hours between rga <dig> and gai-t6rga <dig> mutant seeds compared to wild-type ones , and in all cases 100% germination was attained in 72 hours . in the absence of cold treatment, although all lines reached 100% germination after 96 hours, gai-t <dig> seeds germinated faster and rga <dig> seeds slower than wild-type, while gai-t6rga <dig> mutants showed the same germination kinetics of the latter, i.e. roughly 60%, 40% and 30%, respectively, after 24 hours . after 5 days in the dark, stratified seeds of all mutant lines germinated completely as did wild-type seeds; on the contrary, without stratification, the germination rate of gai-t <dig> and wild-type seeds were similar , whereas both rga <dig> and gai-t6rga <dig> seeds germinated significantly less  . as one function of stratification is to remove seed dormancy, we verified whether the rga <dig> germination phenotype was due to increased seed dormancy.

a seed germination assay, without stratification, was performed with freshly harvested mutant seeds, and with seeds respectively at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> dar, to asses a possible loss of dormancy due to seed storage. the germination rate was scored after seven days under white light. freshly harvested and  <dig> dar single gai-t <dig> and rga <dig> and double gai-t6rga <dig> mutant seeds showed a germination rate lower than 10%, similarly to wild-type seeds . the germination of gai-t <dig> and wild-type seeds increased up to 48% and 52%, respectively, after two weeks of storage; dormancy was almost completely relieved after three weeks - 83% and 97% germination for gai-t <dig> and wild-type seeds, respectively. conversely, rga <dig> and gai-t6rga <dig>  <dig> dar seeds still retained a significantly higher level of dormancy, as revealed by a germination rate of 30% and 22%, respectively. after three weeks of storage both rga <dig> and gai-t6rga <dig> mutant seeds lost part of their dormancy , although only rga <dig> seeds showed a significant difference with wild-type seeds  .

these results point to different effects of gai and rga on seed dormancy: the absence of rga severely increases dormancy, while lack of gai partially compensates rga inactivation, as gai-t6rga <dig> mutant seeds show a milder phenotye than the rga <dig> single mutant.

the dag <dig> and rga <dig> mutations are not epistatic
to elucidate the genetic relationship between the dof gene dag <dig> and the della–encoding genes rga and gai, we constructed the dag1rga <dig> double mutant. in contrast, attempts to isolate the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant were unsuccessful . as the dag <dig> and rga <dig> mutant lines are in different ecotypes , several lines for each genotype - double mutants, parental lines and wild-type - were selected and analysed in order to minimize the effect of the ecotype on the phenotype of interest.

seed germination assays under phyb-dependent conditions  revealed that, in the absence of stratification, the germination rate of dag1rga <dig> double mutant seeds was similar to wild-type seeds , whereas the dag <dig> and rga <dig> single mutant seeds had significant different germination rates , compared to wild-type. in contrast, upon stratification all mutant lines and wild-type seeds germinated almost completely . after stratification and under white light, 100% germination was attained in 72 hours by mutant and wild-type seeds, although rga <dig> mutant seeds showed a significative slower kinetics  . under white light without stratification, rga <dig> seeds exhibit germination properties significantly lower  than dag1rga <dig> , wild-type  and dag <dig>  seeds as measured at 24 hours . after 5 days in the dark, stratified seeds of the mutant lines germinated completely as wild-type seeds ; on the contrary, in the absence of stratification, wild-type, dag <dig> and dag1rga <dig> double mutant seeds showed similarly high germination rates , whereas rga <dig> seeds displayed a significantly lower germination percentage  .

since the dag1rga <dig> seed germination phenotype is not completely similar to that of the single mutants, dag <dig> and rga <dig> do not have an epistatic relationship.

simultaneous inactivation of both dag <dig> and gai affects embryo development
as for the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant, we analysed by pcr-based genotyping more than one hundred f <dig> plants derived from both the dag <dig> × gai-t <dig> and the reciprocal cross, but we were unable to isolate the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant. to verify the possibility that concurrent inactivation of both dag <dig> and gai may affect embryo development, we performed a macroscopic analysis of siliques from plants of the f <dig> generation, which contain f <dig> seeds segregating different combinations of wild-type and mutant alleles of both dag <dig> and gai . we compared the f <dig> seeds derived from the crosses with those of dag <dig> and gai-t <dig> single mutant seeds and of their respective wild-type seeds. moreover, as the single mutants are in different ecotypes, the f <dig> seeds were also compared with seeds in siliques derived from a ws- <dig> × col- <dig> cross, and with the parental lines  also derived from the dag <dig> × gai-t <dig> cross . the results of this analysis revealed a high percentage of aborted seeds  in the f <dig> generation from the dag <dig> × gai-t <dig> and reciprocal crosses, compared with about 1% in the different wild-type siliques, including those from the ws- <dig> × col- <dig> cross. interestingly, while we observed only 2% of aborted seeds in the siliques of the gai-t <dig> single mutant, siliques from the dag <dig> single mutant contained 17% of abnormal seeds, indicating that lack of dag <dig> results in embryonic defects and that the simultaneous absence of gai enhances this phenotype . in addition, in order to minimize the possibility that the embryo-lethal phenotype could be due to the combination of dag <dig> with the gai-t <dig> allele in the col- <dig> ecotype, we performed the same crosses with the gai-t <dig> allele in ler background. analysis by pcr-based genotyping of about one hundred f <dig> plants was again unsuccessful, as we could not isolate the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant. both the frequencies of the dag <dig> and gai-t <dig> single mutants and of the heterozygous lines were different from what expected . further genetic analyses will be required to verify whether any of the different allelic combinations has viability and/or germination problems.

we then analyzed the phenotype of f <dig> embryos and checked for additional phenotypes compared to wild-type and single mutants. in wild-type, dag <dig> and gai-t <dig> single mutants, transversal division of basal vascular cells at globular stage led to asymmetric cells . in contrast, some f <dig> embryos displayed longitudinal divisions , thus altering the radial symmetry of the embryo axis  observed in control plants . an additional phenotype was observed at the transition stage where individuals of the f <dig> embryos showed aberrant triangular shape, as highlighted by the arrow  and also shown in the 3d image  compared to wild-type embryos . interestingly, a small percentage of dag <dig> embryos also showed similar phenotypes .

expression of dag <dig> complements embryo defects and germination properties
to verify whether expression of the dag1-ha chimaeric protein would, at least in part, complement the above-described embryo defects, we crossed the dag1dag1-ha line with the gai-t <dig> single mutant. out of 28 f <dig> plants derived from the cross, we were able to isolate seven dag1gai-t6dag1-ha lines. macroscopic analysis of siliques from these plants revealed normally-developing seeds with a percentage of aborted seeds similar to wild-type . moreover, we analysed the germination properties of dag1gai-t6dag1-ha seeds, as well as of dag1dag1-ha seeds, under phyb-dependent germination conditions, and in the presence or absence of stratification both under white light and in the dark . the transgenic lines were compared with the corresponding wild-type . under all conditions tested, the germination rates of these transgenic lines were not significantly different from those of wild-type seeds. the only conspicuous difference regarded dag1dag1-ha seeds which germinated significantly slower than wild-type .

dag <dig> is expressed during embryo development
we have previously shown that dag <dig> expression is localized in the vascular system of the plant. the dag <dig> promoter is also active in the vascular tissue of seeds during the process of imbibition  <cit> , <cit> . the involvement of dag <dig> in the process of embryogenesis prompted us to further analyse dag <dig> expression during embryo development. we used a dag1:gus reporter transgenic line utilized in a previous study  <cit> . gus activity was observed in embryos at the globular, heart, torpedo, and bent cotyledon stages. interestingly, gus staining was extended to all cells at the globular stage, whereas from the heart stage on it was restricted to the procambium .

discussion
we had previously characterized the dag <dig> transcription factor as a repressor of seed germination  <cit> – <cit>  that acts downstream of pil <dig> and negatively regulates ga biosynthesis  <cit> . as also the della proteins rga and gai act downstream of pil <dig> in seed germination  <cit> , we investigated on the respective roles of these della proteins in this process and their relationship with dag <dig> 

rga and gai have distinct roles in seed germination
rga and gai have been reported to be involved in several growth processes  <cit> , <cit> ; however, the single null mutants rga <dig>  rga <dig> and gai-t <dig> were reported to lack any visible phenotype, and a functional redundancy of the two proteins had been suggested  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . as for seed germination, the single rga <dig> and gai-t <dig> mutants were shown to behave similarly to the wild-type in response to increasing red light fluences  <cit> .

here we show that the rga <dig> and gai-t <dig> single mutants have different seed germination phenotypes, suggesting  distinct functions for rga and gai in this developmental process. in particular, rga <dig> seeds have, in the absence of stratification, a lower germination rate than wild-type irrespective of light conditions. this germination phenotype is likely due to an increased dormancy - as revealed by our germination assays on freshly harvested seeds and on seeds at different dar.

our data suggest that rga plays a negative role in the regulation of seed dormancy. rga has been shown to be involved in seed dormancy and to be directly activated by spatula , which also inhibits the negative regulator of rga mother of-ft-and-tfl <dig>   <cit> - <cit> , but dormancy of the rga <dig> single mutant was not analysed by those authors.

on the other hand, our work shows that although the gai-t <dig> single mutant does not have a dormancy phenotype, lack of gai partially compensates rga inactivation, as gai-t6rga <dig> mutant seeds show a milder phenotye than the rga <dig> single mutant. in addition, in our hands gai-t <dig> mutant seeds showed a germination potential slightly higher than wild-type under white light in the absence of stratification, similar to that of the dag <dig> mutant .

it should be pointed out that rga and gai also differ in their transcriptional regulation in connection with dag1: while we have recently shown a reciprocal negative transcriptional control of the genes dag <dig> and gai during seed germination  <cit> , a previous microarray analysis of ours showed that gai, but not rga, was upregulated by dag <dig> inactivation  <cit> .

inactivation of gai enhances the dag <dig> embryo mutant phenotype
we have previously reported that dag <dig> siliques contain numerous aborted seeds  <cit> . in this work, attempts to isolate the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant were unsuccessful, suggesting that the simultaneous inactivation of both dag <dig> and gai results in an embryo-lethal phenotype, i.e. a more severe phenotype than inactivation of only dag <dig>  this is not due to an additive effect of the two mutations, since a statistical analysis of the siliques revealed that while dag <dig> contained 17% abnormal seeds, only 2% aborted seeds were present in gai-t <dig> and in wild-type siliques. thus, the absence of gai does not in itself lead to seed abnormalities, but inactivation of this gene in a dag <dig> mutant background is apparently responsible for embryo lethality. this may be an additional indication of the cooperation between dag <dig> and gai in controlling common target genes that we pointed out in a previous paper, where we showed that the two proteins cooperate in negatively regulating the atga3ox <dig> gene  <cit> . consistently, we could restore embryo development by expressing the dag1-ha chimaeric protein in the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant background.

the earliest phenotype of the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant is an impairment in cell divisions in the basal portion of the globular stage embryo, the hypophyseal and the procambial precursor cells, but not in the ground precursor cells. consistent with this mutant phenotype, the dag <dig> promoter is active in the embryo starting from the globular stage.

simultaneous inactivation of poltergeist  and poltergeist-like  <dig>  results in defects in basal embryo patterning similar to what described here for the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant  <cit> . pol and pll <dig> are two related phosphatases required to establish the vascular axis in the embryo, by inducing expression of the wuschel  homolog wuschel related homeobox  <dig> .

it is tempting to speculate that dag <dig> and gai may also function in this molecular network. as the double mutant dag1gai-t <dig> has a more severe phenotype than the double mutant polpll <dig>  one might hypothesize that dag <dig> and gai act upstream of pol and pll <dig>  further analysis on the functional and molecular relationship among these factors will help unveiling the complex signaling underlying embryo development.

CONCLUSIONS
here we show that the della proteins rga and gai have, at least partially, different roles in the seed germination process. indeed, rga inactivation results in increased seed dormancy, whereas lack of gai partially compensates this phenotype, as gai-t6rga <dig> mutant seeds show a milder phenotye than the rga <dig> single mutant.

with respect to dag <dig>  our data suggest that this latter and rga act in independent branches of the pil5-controlled germination pathway, whereas gai and dag <dig> are involved in embryo development since the dag1gai-t <dig> double mutant proved embryo-lethal. this latter finding should be regarded in the context of the cooperation of dag <dig> and gai in regulating common target genes, such as in the case of the ga biosynthetic gene atga3ox <dig> that we have very recently demonstrated  <cit> .
