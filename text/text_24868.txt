BACKGROUND
ddit <dig>  encodes a transcription factor belonging to the ccaat/enhancer binding protein  family  <cit> . ddit <dig> is normally transcribed at very low levels but is elevated upon dna damage in cellular stress conditions  <cit> . the ddit <dig> protein has a central role in endoplasmatic reticulum stress and dna damage response by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis  <cit> . ddit <dig> has recently been implicated in the stress response leading to death of pancreatic insulin producing β-cells  <cit>  and it may also be a part of cellular stress conditions causing neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . in addition, ddit <dig> is believed to be involved in growth cessation and terminal differentiation of lipoblasts, osteoblasts and erythrocytes  <cit> . ddit <dig> forms heterodimers with several other c/ebp family members  <cit>  as well as other leucine zipper carrying proteins  <cit>  and the heterodimers are believed to act as dominant negative inhibitors of transcription  <cit> .

ddit <dig> is also a part of a fusion oncogene critical for the development of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma   <cit> . the tumor cells carry the chromosomal translocation t that results in fusion of ddit <dig> to fus  or more rarely the t that fuses ddit <dig> to ewsr <dig>  <cit> . the chimerical fus-ddit <dig> oncoprotein functions as an abnormal transcription factor  <cit>  and localizes to distinct nuclear structures in cultured cells  <cit> . mls/rcls cells exhibit abnormal expression profiles of cell cycle controlling factors and among them cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases   <cit> . in addition, the ddit3-binding c/ebpα has been shown to interact and inhibit the kinase activity of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> . based on these observations, we searched for putative interaction partners of the oncogenic fus-ddit <dig> with g <dig> cyclins and cdks as these might provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which the chimerical oncoprotein induces malignancy.

RESULTS
cdk <dig> and cyclin e colocalize with fus-ddit3
ht <dig> cells were transiently transfected with a fus-ddit3-gfp construct and colocalization between the ectopically expressed fusion oncoprotein and endogenous cyclin d <dig>  cyclin e, cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> was investigated by immunofluorescence. cyclin e and cdk <dig> showed prominent colocalization with the fus-ddit <dig> protein and were detected in fus-ddit <dig> containing granules in the majority of cells . we found no signs of colocalization between fus-ddit <dig> and cdk <dig>  or cyclin d <dig> . cells transfected with the empty gfp vector showed no granules and a smooth nuclear distribution of cdk <dig> and cyclin e .

fus-ddit <dig> binds cdk <dig> through its ddit <dig> part
cells were transfected with fus-ddit3-gfp and cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated with gfp antibodies and further analyzed by western blot. in pilot experiments, we used ht <dig> cells stably expressing fus-ddit3-gfp and could weakly detect endogenous cdk <dig> in immunoprecipitates while cyclin e was not found . to further confirm a possible interaction between fus-ddit <dig> and cdk <dig>  we instead transiently transfected cells using cloned cdk <dig> cdna expressed in frame with the fluorescent protein dsred <dig>  cells co-transfected with cdk2-dsred <dig> and either of fus-ddit <dig> or ddit <dig> expressing constructs showed presence of cdk2-dsred <dig> in anti-gfp immunoprecipitates from both fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig> transfected cells . in contrast, cdk2-dsred <dig> was not found in immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with the n-terminal part of fus present in the fus-ddit <dig> protein or in gfp-transfected control cells . in a reverse experiment, ht <dig> cells were transfected with fus-ddit <dig>  fus-ddit3Δlz, ddit <dig> and gfp constructs and cellular proteins in extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti cdk <dig> antibodies . we found that endogenous cdk <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with ddit <dig>  fus-ddit <dig> and fus-ddit <dig> lacking a leucine zipper domain. these results indicate that the region binding cdk <dig> is located n-terminally of the leucine zipper part of ddit <dig>  clustalw alignment performed between ddit <dig> and the related c/ebpα showed conservation of several amino acids in distinct regions shared by the two proteins but that ddit <dig> lacks a region similar to the one that binds cdk <dig> in c/ebpα  <cit>  .

cdk <dig> expression, phosphorylation status and turnover is not changed by fus-ddit3
the cdk <dig> expression in ht <dig> cells after  <dig> hours of transfection with fus-ddit3-gfp or gfp was investigated by western blot analysis . in addition, the phosphorylation status of cdk <dig> was analyzed using cdk <dig> antibodies targeting either the two inhibitory phosphorylations at threonine  <dig> and tyrosine  <dig> or the activating phosphorylation at threonine  <dig> . no apparent difference in cdk <dig> phosphorylation between cells expressing fus-ddit3-gfp or gfp was detected and the amount of cdk <dig> between the two transfected cell populations was equivalent . the cdk <dig> protein half-life did not differ between stably transfected fus-ddit <dig> cells and ht <dig> control cells upon a six hour cycloheximide chase assay .

cdk <dig> protein binding affinity is altered in fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig> expressing cells
ht <dig> cells were transfected with either of fus-ddit <dig>  ddit <dig> or gfp and cdk <dig> was immunoprecipitated from lysates with cdk <dig> specific antibodies . precipitates were analyzed by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. several bands were present in the fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig> precipitates that were absent in precipitates from gfp expressing cells . bands from three regions were cut as indicated in the figure and analyzed by lc-ms/ms. the cytoskeletal cross-linker plectin , the actin motor-protein myosin  and the intermediary filament protein vimentin  were enriched in immunoprecipitates of fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig> cells. the thicker bands with similar abundance in all three lanes in region  <dig> were identified by mass spectrometry as rabbit heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules.

discussion
in the present study, we used immunofluorescence microscopy to investigate putative colocalization between fus-ddit <dig> and cyclins/cyclin-dependent kinases involved in g <dig> cell cycle control. cdk <dig> and the cdk <dig> binding cyclin e were found to change their localization in fus-ddit <dig> expressing cells to a pattern that was identical to the fus-ddit <dig> nuclear granules reported earlier  <cit> . this suggests that cdk <dig> and cyclin e are translocated to nuclear structures defined by the fus-ddit <dig> protein. as the ddit <dig> part is considered a dna-binding transcription factor  <cit> , we speculate that the fus-ddit <dig> defined structures may contain active chromatin and mrna at different stages of processing. thus, the accumulation of cdk <dig> and cyclin e to such nuclear regions may result in changed phosphorylation patterns and regulation of substrates present at these foci.

ddit <dig> is able to form dna-binding heterodimers with c/ebpα through its leucine zipper region  <cit>  and c/ebpα is reported to bind cdk <dig> and inhibit its kinase activity  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the binding between ddit <dig> and cdk <dig> is mediated through c/ebpα or another c/ebp protein. however, we here show that a ddit <dig> mutant lacking the leucine zipper domain binds cdk <dig>  which implies a binding between ddit <dig> and cdk <dig> that is independent of other c/ebp proteins. ddit <dig> and c/ebpα contain several regions with sequence similarities but the proline-histidine rich part reported to bind cdk <dig> in c/ebpα  <cit>   is not present in ddit <dig>  this suggests that ddit <dig> binds cdk <dig> through a different mechanism than c/ebpα.

analyses of gfp-immunoprecipitates failed to detect cyclin e in these samples. the absence of cyclin e in cdk <dig> immunoprecipitates bears resemblance to previous reports showing that c/ebpα disrupts cdk2/cyclin complexes leading to growth arrest  <cit> . hence, it is possible that the ddit <dig> bound to cdk <dig> disrupts cdk2/cyclin e complexes in similar way as c/ebpα. consequently, since cyclin e is a major regulator of cdk <dig> kinase activity in g <dig>  the ddit <dig> binding may alter cdk <dig> activity in ddit <dig> and fus-ddit <dig> expressing cells. we did however not detect a change in phosphorylation status of cdk <dig> in fus-ddit <dig> expressing cells compared to control cells. to further analyze the functional effects of ddit3/fus-ddit <dig> binding to cdk <dig>  we immunoprecipitated cdk <dig> in cells transiently transfected with fus-ddit <dig>  ddit <dig> and gfp constructs. analysis of the precipitates revealed enhanced binding of cdk <dig> to components of the cytoskeleton in cells expressing fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig>  an increased affinity for cytoskeletal components and crosstalk between cell cycle proteins and cytoskeletal regulatory proteins could lead to changes in cytoskeleton structure  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show that cdk <dig> is translocated to nuclear structures defined by the fus-ddit <dig> oncoprotein and that it binds the ddit <dig> part of the chimera. cyclin e is also recruited to fus-ddit <dig> nuclear structures but can not be found in cdk2-containing ddit3/fus-ddit <dig> precipitates. the interaction of fus-ddit <dig> and ddit <dig> with cdk <dig> appears to alter the binding affinity of cdk <dig>  possibly leading to changed phosphorylation patterns and regulation of cytoskeletal or other proteins. many of the observed biological effects of ddit <dig> may involve the interaction with cdk <dig>
