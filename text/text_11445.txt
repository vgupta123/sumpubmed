BACKGROUND
transcription factors  are important part of the functional genomics. since the first transcription factor was found in maize  <cit> , a large number of tfs have been proven to participate in various physiological processes and regulatory networks in higher plants. gras proteins are named after gai, rga and scr , the first three functionally identified members in this family. typically, proteins of this family exhibit considerable sequence homology to each other in their c-terminus, within which motifs including lhr i, vhiid, lhr ii, pfyre and saw can be recognized in turn . in contrast, n-terminus of gras family varies in length and sequence, which seems like the major contributor to the functional specificity of each gene  <cit> .

by far, gras gene family has been genome-wide explored in several plant species, including populus, arabidopsis, rice, chinese cabbage, prunus mume, and pine . however, only small number of gras proteins were functionally characterized, including some members identified in zea mays, petunia hybrida, medicago truncatula, lilium longiflorum . these genes play crucial roles in diverse fundamental processes of plant growth and development. for instance, the most widely known sub-branch of gras proteins, which share the amino acid sequence della in their n-terminal region and thus are referred as della proteins, function as repressors of gibberellin signaling  <cit> . the scr and shr, which belong to two different sub-branches of gras family, are both involved in radial organization of the root through forming a scr/shr complex  <cit> . two independent studies demonstrated that endodermis-expressed scl <dig> acted as an integrator downstream of the ga/della and scr/shr pathways, mediating the ga-promoted cell elongation during root development  <cit> . another sub-branch, which contains  <dig> highly homologous in arabidopsis, pat <dig>  scl <dig>  scl <dig>  and scl <dig>  are involved in light signaling pathways. interestingly, pat <dig>  scl <dig>  scl <dig> are positive regulators of phytochrome-a signal transduction while scl <dig> is mainly participated in phytochrome-b signal transduction . two gras proteins, nsp <dig> and nsp <dig> can form a dna binding complex which is essential for nodulation signaling in legumes  <cit> . moc <dig>  mainly expressed in the axillary buds, has a pivotal role in controlling rice tillering  <cit> . ls and las, the homologous gene of moc <dig> in tomato and arabidopsis, also act in the axillary meristem initiation of tomato  <cit> . in addition, liscl is a transcriptional activator of some meiosis-associated genes, participates in the microsporogenesis of the lily anther  <cit> . ham mediates signals from differentiating cells for controlling shoot meristem maintenance in the petunia  <cit> . and three arabidopsis orthologs of petunia ham, scl6/scl6-iv, scl22/scl6-iii and scl27/scl6-ii, also known as targets of post-transcriptional degradation by mirna170/ <dig>  have been demonstrated to play an important role in the proliferation of meristematic cells, polar organization and chlorophyll synthesis .

tomato  is an important crop because of its great nutritive and commercial value, and also a good model plant for fleshy fruit development. with the release of the whole genome sequence of tomato  <cit> , it is very convenient to comprehensive analysis an entire gene family now. to date, transcription factor families like erf, wrky, sbp-box, iaa, arf, and tcp have already been identified in tomato . here, considering the important role of gras proteins in plant growth regulation and the lack of information about this gene family in the crop, we describe on the first characterization of the entire gras gene family of transcription factors in tomato. the present work identified  <dig> putative slgras genes, together with analyzing their gene classification, chromosome distribution, phylogenetic comparison and exon-intron organization. in addition, the expression profile analysis of slgras genes by real time qpcr in different stages of vegetative and reproductive development were performed, and their transcript abundance in response to different hormones and abiotic stress treatments were also investigated. this study provides details of gras gene family and facilitates the further functional characterization of gras genes in tomato.

RESULTS
identification and multiple sequence analysis of slgras genes
phytozome search tools  was performed using keywords search with “gras”, and  <dig> genes were found when searched against the pfam gras hidden-markov model . however, one of them, solyc09g <dig> . <dig> was excluded because it represented only part of the gras domain and was annotated as an bola-like protein in the tomato genome database . meanwhile, blastp analysis using the amino acid  sequences of characterized atgras proteins as queries obtained  <dig> previously annotated gras members in tomato wgs chromosomes , which were all included in the  <dig> gras genes identified above. subsequently, online bioinformatics tools, expasy-prosite  and tblastn of ncbi showed that all sequences contained a gras domain, thus further confirmed the authenticity of the identified slgras genes. taken together, a total of  <dig> distinct gras transcription factors were indentified in tomato genome . all of the  <dig> tomato gras genes were mapped onto the  <dig> tomato chromosomes and then renamed based on their distributions and relative linear orders among the respective chromosome , among which, sldella and slls were kept as their already existed name, and so did the slgras <dig> to slgras <dig>  which were previously described by mayrose et al.  <cit> . the tomato gras genes display uneven distributions across the chromosomes., chr <dig> occupies the largest number of gras genes ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> gras genes were found on chr <dig>  chr  <dig>  chr <dig>  chr <dig>  chr  <dig>  and chr <dig>  respectively, and the other  <dig> chromosomes each have  <dig> gras genes. besides, there are  <dig> slgras genes  clustered into seven tandem duplication event regions on tomato chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the size of the deduced gras proteins varies greatly, ranging from  <dig> amino acids  to  <dig> amino acids . the molecular weight varies from  <dig> to 98 kda, and the predicted theoretical pi also varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these facts indicate that different slgras proteins might function in different microenvironments. most members possess a variable n-termianl and a single highly conserved c-terminal gras domain. however, three members  present their gras domains in the n-terminal part, whereas slgras <dig>  contains two gras domains. interestingly,  <dig> gras genes with only one exon were found, which seems like a widespread phenomenon of this gene family observed in many plant species . the exon number of other gras genes ranged from two to five. more detailed information about each gras gene was shown in fig.  <dig>  including the gras gene group name, gene locus number, the length of coding sequences, the schematic plots of gras domain, the exon-intron structure, the molecular weight, and the theoretical pi information.fig.  <dig> the information of  <dig> gras transcription factors identified in tomato genome. slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  whose full amino acid length less than  <dig> were distributed to “no group” and were excluded from some of the following analyses

fig.  <dig> positions of gras gene family members on the solanum lycopersicum chromosomes. tandemly duplicated genes were indicated in red colour



from the alignment of predicted gras domain sequences we found members containing partial gras domains with missing motifs, some of which were severely truncated. in tomato, for instance, the gras domain of slgras <dig> could be as short as  <dig> amino acids, while the typical gras domain had a minimum length of about  <dig> amino acids , thereby  <dig> non-canonical gras proteins  were excluded from some of the following analyses  because of the low reliability by incorporating these fragments. furthermore, although the multiple sequence analysis showed a low overall identity among the  <dig> analyzed slgras proteins, the  <dig> most prominent motifs, including leucine-rich region i , vhiid, leucine-rich region ii , pfyre, and saw could be observed in their gras domains .fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> gras domain from tomato gras genes obtained by clustalx and manual correction. the most conserved motif of gras domain, vhiid, was underlined



phylogenetic analysis and classification of gras members from arabidopsis and tomato
to uncover the evolutionary history of the gras gene family in tomato and to help in their classification, a total of  <dig> gras proteins, comprising  <dig> from arabidopsis,  <dig> from tomato,  <dig> from prunus mume,  <dig> from populus, and  <dig> from rice, were performed to construct an unrooted phylogenetic tree usingneighbor-joining  method by mega <dig>  . based on the phylogenetic tree, the gras proteins could be divided into  <dig> subfamilies: atpat <dig>  atscl4/ <dig>  atscl <dig>  atshr, ham, atlas, atscr, atscl <dig>  atscl <dig> della, pt <dig>  os <dig>  and os <dig>  agree well with the tree made by liu et al.  <cit> . it is noteworthy that some gras proteins considered to be species-specific in previous publications have homologs in tomato. for example,  <dig> tomato slgras genes , together with pmgras <dig> and ptgras <dig>  belong to “pt20” subfamily, which was previously regarded as populus-specific group  <cit> . two  and one  tomato gras genes, were clustered into “os4” and “os19” subfamily, respectively, which were previously reported as rice-specific protein groups  <cit> . these three subfamilies did not include any arabidopsis genes, implying lineage-specific gene loss in arabidopsis. the other  <dig> subfamilies harbor gras genes from each of the five species with one to eleven slgras genes per group. to date, the functions of the slls and sldella protein have been clearly illuminated in tomato . atpat <dig> subfamily includes  <dig> members from tomato, two slgras proteins  and three slgras proteins  have high sequence similarity with atpat <dig> and atscl <dig>  respectively, which are associated with phytochrome a and b signaling, respectively  <cit> , suggesting that tomato gras homologs might have similar functions in the phytochrome signal transduction. six proteins  are clustered into atscl <dig> subfamily. although the biological roles of arabidopsis gras proteins in this group are largely unknown, a member of this group in lilium longiflorum named liscl was identified as transcriptional regulator during microsporogenesis  <cit> . five  and three  proteins belong to atshr and atscr subfamily, respectively. considering the important role of atshr and atscr proteins in root and shoot radial patterning  <cit> , we predict these homologous genes in tomato may be related to root and shoot development. two proteins  belong to atscl <dig> subfamily, which regulates root cell elongation by integrating multiple signals in arabidopsis  <cit> . slgras <dig> is the only member of atscl <dig> subfamily in tomato, and a homologous gene identified in rice, osgras <dig> , is involved in controlling the plant height of by modulating brassinosteroid signaling  <cit> . there are  <dig> slgras proteins  clustered into the ham subfamily. in arabidopsis,  <dig> gras proteins of this group are post-transcriptionally regulated by mir <dig>   <cit> . here, the closest homologs of these arabidopsis genes in tomato are the two genes, slgras <dig> and slgras <dig>  both having a putative binding site for sly-mir <dig>  hence, 5’-race was performed to confirm their relationship. as expected, the 5’-race products of the predicted size to be generated from cleaved slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> template could be amplified. subsequently, these products were cloned and the sequences of several independent inserts were determined. sequencing results showed that the complementary sequences of each gene to sly-mir <dig> mature sequence as well as the cleavage sites were exactly the same . interestingly, in silico analysis  showed that another member of ham subfamily, slgras <dig>  can also bind sly-mir <dig> mature sequence and was predicted to be regulated through translational repression rather than mrna cleavage, suggesting that a complicated regulatory mechanism of sly-mir <dig> and its target genes in tomato.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of gras proteins. the phylogenetic tree was generated by neighbor-joining method derived from clustalx alignment of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 16gras amino acid sequences from tomato, arabidopsis, populus, p.mume, and rice, respectively. members in the same sub-branch were marked by circle filled with same color

fig.  <dig> cleavage sites of mir <dig> at complementary sequences of slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> determined by 5’-race. the electrophoretogram shows the pcr products representing the 3’-cleavage fragments that were cloned and sequenced for each gene. both slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> were cleaved between 10th and 11th, 13th and 14th nt of mature mir <dig> sequence 



in addition, to further explore the orthologous relationships of gras genes between tomato and other solanaceae crops,  <dig> and  <dig> gras genes from potato  and pepper , respectively, were selected to construct another phylogenetic tree . we found that almost every member of slgras genes  has its homologous gene in either or both of potato and pepper genome, suggesting that the evolutional conservation and closer homology relationship among gras genes in closely related species.

expression analysis of slgras genes in different tissues and organs
to investigate the potential functions of slgras genes during tomato development, their expression patterns were carried out in different tissues including root, stem, leaf, bud, anthesis flower and three stages of fruit development using qrt-pcr. in the qpcr analysis, genes exhibiting ct value >  <dig> were treated as non-expressors. as shown in figs.  <dig> and 10a, a total of  <dig> slgras gene transcripts were obtained, while  <dig> other slgras genes could not be detected because of their low expression levels or might be pseudogenes. it is apparent that the expression levels in different tissues vary widely among the tomato gras genes, as well as among different tissues for individual gras genes. of them,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were found exhibit the highest expression in stems, anthesis flowers, and roots, respectively. during fruit development, generally higher transcript abundance can be observed in immature fruits than mature fruits, which suggests that those genes might relate to early fruit development. nevertheless, several genes show dramatic increase at the breaker stage compared to the immature stage. for example, slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  and slgras <dig> display relatively strong and specific expression during fruit ripening, indicating that they might have functional significance during the onset of ripening.fig.  <dig> the expression profiles of  <dig> slgras genes analyzed using qpcr during eight stages of development. y-axis represents relative expression values and x-axis represents stages of development as follows: r root, s stem, l leaf, bud bud flower, ant anthesis flower, im immature green stages, br breaker stage, and rf red ripe stage of fruit development. the expression data of root were normalized to  <dig>  error bars show the standard error between three replicates performed

a large number of slgras genes demonstrate relatively high expression in flowers, suggesting the important role of these genes in such tissues. given that many gras proteins are involved in regulating the gibberellic acid  response, one of the key plant hormones during fruit set  <cit> , we analyzed the expression profiles of slgras genes during the flower-to-fruit transition process . of all the  <dig> slgras genes identified,  <dig> genes exhibite higher expression in stamen while the transcripts of  <dig> genes are more abundant in ovary tissues, indicating functional specialization among gras gene family members in tomato floral organs, at least in stamen and ovary. the data show that most of slgras genes undergo a drastic change in their mrna levels either or both in stamens and ovaries, suggesting that the gras family members play different roles during pollination/fertilization.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of  <dig> gras family genes in response to hormone treatments in two different parts of seedlings. black and gray columns stand for the expression levels of the plant shoot part and root part collected from tomato seedlings, respectively. the x-axis represents various hormone treatments. c control sample, eth ethephon, ga <dig> gibberellin, iaa indole acetic acids, sa salicylic acid. the expression data of control sample were normalized to  <dig>  error bars show the standard error between three replicates performed



expression analysis of slgras genes in response to hormone treatments
plant hormones have been extensively studied for their roles in the regulation of various aspects of plant development. in this study, hormone treatments resulted in a wide variety of slgras gene expression profiles . the expression levels of  <dig> gras genes detected vary significantly in response to different hormone treatments as well as in different tissues in response to an individual hormone treatment, suggesting that the slgras genes have differences in signal-selectivity not only among different hormones but also among different tissues of tomato seedlings. in ethephon  treatment,  <dig> and  <dig> slgras genes were obviously induced and inhibited, respectively. of them, the most up-regulated gene was slgras <dig> in roots, and the most down-regulated gene was slgras <dig> in shoots. similarly, ga treatment led to  <dig> and  <dig> slgras genes were obviously induced and inhibited, respectively, the most up-regulated gene was slgras <dig> in roots, while the most down-regulated gene was slgras <dig> in roots. in iaa treatment,  <dig> and  <dig> slgras were significantly induced and inhibited, respectively, and slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> in roots were found to be most up- and down-regulated, respectively. as for sa treatment,  <dig> and  <dig> slgras genes showed dramatic increase and decrease, respectively, slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> in roots went through the largest increase and decrease, respectively. notably, several genes even demonstrated opposite expression in roots and shoots when responding to the same hormone treatment. for instance, slgras <dig> was up-regulated in shoots in response to eth, ga <dig> and iaa treatments, while down-regulated in roots. similar expression patterns were found in slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  slgras <dig>  and slgras <dig>  the results suggest the complicated regulatory mechanism of these genes in response to hormone treatments in tomato. taken together, these expression variations indicate that the slgras gene family members were collectively regulated by a broad range of hormonal signals. thus it is reasonable to speculate that those relevant genes might play pivotal roles in the cross-talk of hormones and should be candidates for further research in the field.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of  <dig> gras family genes in response to abiotic treatments. the x-axis represents different abiotic stresses. c control sample, ss salt stress, ds drought stress, cs cold stress, hs heat stress, osms osmotic stress, oxis oxidative stress. the expression data of control sample were normalized to  <dig>  error bars show the standard error between three replicates performed



expression analysis of slgras genes in response to abiotic treatments
to further assess the functions of slgras genes that may be involved in plant defenses to abiotic stresses, we analyzed the expressions of slgras genes in response to salt, drought, cold, heat, osmotic and oxidative stress . although only two genes  were found to be hyperresponsive to all treatments, all the analyzed genes exhibited differential expression in response to at least one abiotic stress treatments. overall, in the six stressed conditions, a total of  <dig> slgras genes were significantly induced, implying their putative roles in stress tolerance.  <dig> and  <dig> slgras genes showed obviously increase and decrease under salt treatment, among which, slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> underwent the greatest mrna levels change, respectively. similarly,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated following drought treatment with greatest change in slgras <dig> and slgras <dig>  respectively. intriguingly, most members showed strong sensitivity toward heat  and cold treatments , and the largest differential expression usually observed when responding to one of these two treatments. for example, the transcript accumulation of slgras <dig> exhibited more than 250-folds change during cold stress compared to that in the control plants and slgras <dig> showed more than 50- folds change in response to heat treatment. by contrast, not too much change observed in most slgras genes when osmotic and oxidative stresses were carried out. these data show the potential of some slgras genes for enhancing adversity resistant capacity, especially considering that the tomato is an extremely temperature-sensitive crop.fig.  <dig> the expression profiles of slgras genes visualized as heatmaps with respect to different tissues , floral organs , hormone treatments , and stress treatments . members in the same subfamily based on the phylogenetic tree  were grouped together. the color scale represents log <dig> expression values. the relative expression levels of root, - <dig> dpa stamen, and untreated control samples were normalized to 0



discussion
to date, several attempts have been made to group members of gras family into subfamilies that reflect their evolutionary relationships . these dendrograms were in substantial agreement though some fine-tunings. the bioinformatic analysis of gras proteins showing higher similarity within the same species indicates that gene duplications have occurred after the split among these lineages. compared to arabidopsis, larger number of gras proteins arisen in tomato suggests more gene duplications events or higher frequency of the retaining copies after duplication in tomato. taken the tandem duplication events as example, 2/ <dig>  10/ <dig>  15/ <dig>  17/ <dig>  40/ <dig> gras genes were identified as tandem duplicated genes in arabidopsis  <cit> , p.mume  <cit> , tomato , rice  <cit> , and populus  <cit> , respectively, further validating that the duplication events are the most common mechanism contributing to the rapid expansion of gras gene family members in different species. meanwhile, the exon-intron organization analysis showed that  <dig>  % of slgras genes were intronless in tomato , with proportions  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, 55 % and  <dig>  % in p.mume, arabidopsis, rice and populus, respectively . the high percentage of intronless genes in gras gene family in plant implies the close evolutionary relationship of gras proteins. apart from gras gene family, intronless genes are also enriched in some other large gene families, such as f-box transcription factor gene family  <cit> , dead box rna helicases  <cit> , and small auxin-up rnas  gene family  <cit> . generally, intronless genes are archetypical in the prokaryotic genomes, and there are three explanations for the formation of the intronless genes in eukaryotic genomes: horizontal gene transfer from ancient prokaryotes, duplication of existing intronless genes, and retroposition of intron-containing genes  <cit> . zhang et al.  <cit>  recently reported the origin of plant gras genes from prokaryotic genomes of bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. that might be the reason of the abundant intronless genes in the gras gene family, which is likely to be its prokaryotic origin followed by extensive duplication events in the evolutionary history.

intrinsically disordered proteins  are highly abundant in eukaryotic proteomes and important for cellular functions. an idr  within an idp often undergoes disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to various partners, allowing an idp to recognize and bind different partners at various binding interfaces  <cit> . by computational and bioinformatics tools, sun et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the gras proteins are intrinsically disordered. one of the distinguishing features of gras proteins is its variable n-terminal, which is predicted to contain morfs , short interaction-prone segments that are located within idrs and are able to recognize their interacting partners by undergoing disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to these specific partners  <cit> . in tomato, except a few uncanonical gras proteins, multiple sequence analysis of tomato gras proteins showed that most members in this family possess a highly variable n-terminal domain, indicating the functional versatility of this gene family in tomato. highly conserved c-terminal domains  were observed in most slgras proteins. generally, leucine-rich regions i  and ii  flank the vhiid motif to form a lr i-vhiid-lr ii pattern present in most gras proteins. it has been widely and experimentally confirmed for many gras proteins that the lri-vhiid-lrii pattern or individual motifs within the pattern are used for interactions with protein partners .

due to the functional diversity of gras genes, many members of this gene family need to be further functionally characterized. the expression patterns of slgras genes here could help us to assess their possible functions.  <dig> slgras genes were undetectable in any tissues/organs suggests a tendency to degenerate those genes after gene duplication or the lost of their functions during evolution. on the whole, the expression patterns vary greatly among different members even between those orthologous pair genes  . previously, expression profiles of gras genes in populus and p.mume also demonstrated rather broad expression patterns across a variety of tissues, not only among subfamilies but members in the same clade  <cit> . these results suggest that gras genes may undergo neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization in many higher plant species. yet still, some gras genes with extremely high sequence identity   exhibited conserved expression patterns, implying their retention by genetic redundancy and selection for their contributions to the robustness of the genetic network. slgras <dig> slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> with high mrna levels in roots and stems suggests conserved functions with their homologous gene atshr  <cit>  and atscr  <cit> , which are involved in root and shoot radial patterning in arabidopsis. the strong ovary-preferential expression of slgras <dig> during flower-fruit transition suggests its potential role in fruit development by modulating brassinosteroid signaling  <cit> . the homologs of atscl <dig>  displayed high mrna levels in anthesis flowers, indicating that they may exert new functions during pollination/fertilization by modulating ga signaling  <cit> . our results have proved that slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> can be cleaved by mir <dig> , one of the most conserved mirnas in plants, suggesting that they may have similar functions with their homologous genes characterized in other species such as arabidopsis  <cit> . however, the expression patterns of slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> in tomato are largely different, which suggests that the complicated and widespread functions of the mir171-grass regulatory networks in tomato. noticeably, according to the supplementary table  <dig> of tomato genome consortium  <cit> , there are  <dig> slgras genes  were differentially expressed from mature green stage fruits to breaker stage fruits. our results are consistent with the above data, suggesting the pivotal roles of these genes during fruit ripening. two of them, slgras <dig> and slgras <dig>  predominantly expressed in breaker and red ripening stage fruits, have been reported as target genes of rin  <cit> , which is key transcriptional regulator during fruit ripening. moreover, the spatio-temporal expression patterns revealed that the majority members of slgras identified presented sharply increase or decrease upon pollination/fertilization either or both in stamen and ovary  , indicating their potential active roles during ovary and anther development. considering the relationship between gras genes and ga signaling, we speculate that members of this gene family involve in mediating ga responses during flower-to-fruit transition.

plant growth and development are regulated by a chemically and structurally diverse group of hormones. many known growth and development responses to hormones are due to modulation of gene expression, and these responses are among the best characterized to date  <cit> . in general, hormones control the expression of genes by regulating the abundance of two types of gene regulatory proteins, transcription factors and transcriptional repressors. to our knowledge, the relationship between gras proteins and hormones remain scarce, apart from the widely known gibberellin  <cit> , only a few reports mentioned some members involved in auxin and brassinosteroid signal transduction  <cit> . among four hormones conducted here, auxin  is involved in almost all aspects of plant growth and development, from embryogenesis to senescence, from root tip to shoot tip  <cit> . gibberellic acid also regulates a diverse array of developmental processes such as seed development and germination, organ elongation and control of flowering time  <cit> . ethylene and salicylic acid play important roles in biotic stresses  <cit> , while ethylene is also the key regulator during fleshy fruit ripening  <cit> . it has been reported that bnscl <dig>  a gras protein identified in brassica napus, showed differential dose response to auxin in shoots and roots  <cit> . the current results demonstrated that the majority of slgras genes detected here displayed distinct changes following different hormone treatments, and some of them even exhibited opposite trends in roots and shoots, suggesting that gras transcription factors regulate gene expression by modulating phytohormone signaling through complicated networks . additionally, several studies have revealed that gras genes play potential regulatory roles in stress responses. pescl <dig>  a member of gras genes from poplar, was regarded useful for engineering drought- and salt-tolerant trees  <cit> . over-expression of a bnlas gene in arabidopsis thaliana could increase its drought tolerance  <cit> . the della protein was proved to be involved in many abiotic stresses such as low temperature, phosphate starvation, and high no concentration . as for the evidence of gras proteins in the regulation of plant defence responses in tomato: transcripts corresponding to gras genes in resistant tomato plants infected with virulent phytopathogenic bacteria were different  <cit> . furthermore, the expression analysis by qrt-pcr showed that several tomato gras genes were associated with plant disease resistance and mechanical stress response  <cit> . many transcription factor families have been shown to display stress-responsive gene expression with significant overlap in response to various stress treatments, indicating the cross correlation upon signaling pathways involved in various stresses. the induction of slgras genes in response to more than one stress treatments in the present work highlights the wide involvement of gras genes in environmental adaptation . we observed that slgras genes showed larger accumulation under salt, cold, and heat treatments compared to other three treatments, suggesting that the slgras gene family members might play more important roles in response to these three stress conditions. combined analysis of all qpcr data , we found that four highly homologous genes belonging to atpat subfamily  exhibit similar expression levels when responding to hormone and abiotic treatments, implying that these genes may be also involved in hormone signaling and stress response. consistently, two genes of this subfamily from rice, cigr <dig> and cigr <dig>  were reported to be gibberellin and stress related  <cit> . slgras <dig> was significantly decreased in response to all hormone treatments while obviously increased in its mrna levels upon four abiotic stresses. likewise, slgras <dig> was induced by all hormone treatments, and the strong upregulation of its transcripts under cold stress suggests the great potential for cold stress tolerance. interestingly, both slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> share strong sequence similarity to atscl <dig>  a gras transcription factor that is essential for the activation of stress-inducible promoters  <cit> . a homologous gene of atscl <dig> from rice, osgras <dig>  is involved in drought stress response through regulating expression of stress-responsive genes  <cit> . thus, we deduce that slgras <dig> and slgras <dig> may play important role in eliciting stress responsive genes in tomato. besides, several slgras genes were dramatically regulated under both hormone and abiotic stress treatments, indicating the coordinate response of these two determinants.

CONCLUSIONS
although some classical functions of gras transcription factors have already been characterized in several plant species, more members of the gras family in agricultural crops, especially in those with fleshy fruits, remain to be further studied. in this work,  <dig> gras transcription factors were indentified in tomato. the information generated about the structure of slgras proteins will shed light on their functional analysis. the comparative, phylogenetic, and expression analyses of gras members will be useful to comprehensive functional characterization of the gras gene family, and to better understanding their possible roles in mediating hormone cross-talk and abiotic stress. after all, the data shown here should be taken into consideration in future studies for genetic improvements of agronomic traits and/or stress tolerance in tomato and probably other solanaceae plants.
