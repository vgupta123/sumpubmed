BACKGROUND
a long-standing mystery facing neurobiologists is the molecular mechanism underlying the highly-diversified neural network in vertebrate brains  <cit> . the discovery of three closely-linked protocadherin  clusters in mammalian genomes has led to an intriguing speculation that these genes may provide a profound molecular code for specifying neuron-neuron connections in the central nervous system  <cit> . each of the three clusters, designated pcdh α, β, and γ clusters, contains different numbers of large  'variable' exons. each of these exons encodes an extracellular domain comprising six repeats of calcium-binding ectodomain , a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic segment. the 3' ends of the α and γ  clusters contain three 'constant' exons each, that are alternatively spliced to individual variable exons in their respective clusters. the constant exons encode the main part of the cytoplasmic domain shared by all members in the same cluster  <cit> . in many ways, this type of genomic organization resembles the immunoglobulin and t-cell receptor gene loci, which are widely known for their ability to generate a remarkably diverse repertoire of antigen recognizing molecules. pcdh genes are expressed mainly in the neurons, and their proteins are highly enriched on synaptic membranes  <cit> . the transcription of pcdh genes is controlled by individual promoters located adjacent to each variable exon  <cit> , which contribute to the differential expression patterns of individual pcdh genes in the central nervous system  <cit> . the pcdh genes also appear to be under a higher order of complex regulation since their expression seems to be allele-selective  <cit> , and individual neurons, even of the same kind, express an overlapping but distinct combination of pcdh genes  <cit> . more recently, two long-range cis-regulatory elements in pcdhα cluster have been identified and proposed to underlie the monoallelic expression of the pcdh genes  <cit> . taken together, these features of pcdh genes indeed suggest that they have the potential to play a fundamental role in establishing neural diversity in the brain.

the pcdh clusters are essentially a vertebrate innovation that accompanied the emergence of the neural tube and the elaborate central nervous system. no such pcdh cluster has been identified in invertebrate genomes  <cit> . mammals contain a single pcdh locus consisting of about  <dig> genes  <cit> . the lobe-finned fish, coelacanth, which is believed to be a forerunner of tetrapods, also contains a single pcdh locus organized into α, β, and γ clusters similar to mammals, with a total of  <dig> genes  <cit> . in contrast, the teleost fish, zebrafish, contains two unlinked pcdh loci , presumably due to the 'fish-specific' genome duplication  <cit> . the zebrafish genes in each locus are organized into only α and γ clusters. the two loci collectively contain at least  <dig> genes. the massive expansion of pcdh genes in zebrafish has been attributed to lineage-specific expansion of individual genes in some pcdh clusters  <cit> . interestingly, the zebrafish pcdh genes have experienced concerted evolution through adaptive selection and gene conversion  <cit> . thus, the structure and organization of pcdh clusters in zebrafish is quite divergent from that in lobe-finned fish and mammals. it has been speculated that the differences in the complement of pcdhs in zebrafish and mammals could be related to the anatomical differences of their brains  <cit> . however, it is not known whether the organization of pcdh clusters in zebrafish is typical of all teleost fishes or unique to the zebrafish lineage. teleosts are the largest and most successful group of vertebrates. the extant teleosts include almost the same number of species as all other living vertebrate species combined. teleost fishes also exhibit wide diversity in their habitat, morphology, behavior, physiology and adaptations  <cit> . given the possible function of protocadherins in the formation of neural complexity, it would be of interest to characterize pcdh clusters from diverse groups of teleost fishes.

in this study, we report the sequencing and comparative analysis of pcdh clusters in the pufferfish, fugu rubripes. pufferfishes are unique in having the smallest genome among vertebrates. the reduction in the genome size of pufferfish is attributed to a paucity of repetitive sequences and short intergenic regions and introns. at  <dig> mb, the fugu genome is one-eighth the human genome and one-quarter the size of the zebrafish genome. a 'draft' sequence of the fugu genome was completed in  <dig> purely by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy  <cit> . however, we found that most of pcdh genes were misassembled in the 'draft' genome sequence, most likely due to the presence of a highly similar 3' region  shared by all the variable exons in the same paralog subcluster . we therefore sequenced overlapping cosmid and bac clones and meticulously assembled the complete sequence for the pcdh loci. our results show that there are two unlinked pcdh loci in fugu, similar to zebrafish, and they contain at least  <dig> genes. the pcdh <dig> locus in fugu has undergone an extensive degeneration, resulting in the complete loss of the γ cluster. based on the inferred evolutionary relationships of fugu and zebrafish pcdh genes, we were able to reconstruct the two pcdh loci in the common ancestor of fugu and zebrafish and the ancestral single pcdh locus in the teleost fish lineage prior to the 'fish-specific' whole-genome duplication. our data indicate that pcdh clusters in teleost fishes have undergone extensive diversification largely through lineage-specific degeneration, tandem gene duplication, and gene conversion.

RESULTS
two unlinked protocadherin loci in fugu
we searched the fugu 'draft' genome assembly for scaffolds containing pcdh genes by tblastn using the human pcdh protein sequences as the query. altogether we identified about  <dig> scaffolds with high similarity  to pcdh sequences. a closer inspection of the scaffold sequences showed that most of them were either misassembled pcdh cluster sequences, due to the presence of a stretch of nearly identical sequences across about  <dig> bp shared by multiple pcdh variable exons, or contained non-clustering pcdh genes. only three scaffolds  contain reliably-assembled sequences equivalent to the pcdh constant regions. detailed examination of scaffold_ <dig>  revealed that this scaffold contains a small pcdhα cluster, consisting of three variable exons followed by three constant exons, but no pcdhγ genes . these genes are flanked by several non-pcdh genes, indicating that this is a complete pcdh locus . to verify this, we have identified three overlapping cosmid clones that span this region . the sizes of these cosmid clones, as inferred by mapping their end sequences to scaffold_ <dig> sequence, range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb. these are typical sizes of cosmid clones and thus indicate that there are no large scale deletions or insertions at the pcdh locus on the assembled scaffold_ <dig> sequence. to confirm this, we analyzed cosmid clone c112d <dig>  whose sequence spans the entire pcdh <dig> locus, by restriction mapping using three enzymes  and found that it contains  <dig> kb insert and its restriction map exactly matches that predicted from scaffold_ <dig> sequences . this confirms that the pcdh cluster on scaffold_ <dig> represents a complete fugu pcdh locus, and contains only three pcdhα genes and no pcdhγ genes. phylogenetic analyses of the variable  and constant  exons showed that these genes are orthologous to zebrafish drpcdh1α genes. we thus designated this pcdh locus as frpcdh <dig> . we filled gaps in the pcdh constant region in scaffold_ <dig> and scaffold_ <dig> by pcr using fugu genomic dna as a template and extended the sequences by identifying and sequencing overlapping cosmid or bac clones . this approach resulted in two contiguous sequences of length  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb.

the larger contig includes a complete pcdhα cluster containing  <dig> variable exons and three constant exons, followed by the first  <dig> variable exons of a pcdhγ cluster . we identified three non-pcdh genes, fetf <dig>  ffbxw <dig> and ffgf <dig> upstream of the pcdhα cluster indicating that the α cluster on this contig is complete . the shorter contig contains  <dig> variable exons and three constant exons of a pcdhγ cluster, followed by two non-pcdh genes, fdiaph <dig> and ftrpc <dig> . rt-pcr with forward primers corresponding to variable exons of the pcdhγ cluster of the larger contig and a reverse primer for the constant region of pcdhγ in the shorter contig  showed that the two contigs belong to the same locus. we designate this locus as frpcdh <dig> locus . we were unable to fill the gap between the two contigs due to the lack of a genomic clone spanning the two contigs. attempts to fill the gap by long-template pcr using fugu genomic dna as a template also failed, presumably due to the large size of the gap between the two contigs. the frpcdh <dig> locus contains  <dig> α variable exons and at least  <dig> γ variable exons. the exons downstream of the gap have been numbered with a prime sign  to indicate that the numbers may not represent their actual positions in the cluster. thus, fugu possesses two unlinked pcdh loci, pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig> 

the two pcdh loci in fugu apparently resulted from segmental duplication from an ancestral pcdh cluster. phylogenetic analyses using constant  and variable  regions of fugu and zebrafish pcdh genes show that the two pcdh loci in fugu are orthologous to the duplicate zebrafish pcdh loci, respectively, indicating that the locus duplication took place before the divergence of the two lineages. this duplication is most likely the result of the "fish-specific' whole genome duplication event that occurred early during the evolution of ray-finned fishes  <cit> . like the two zebrafish pcdh loci, both fugu pcdh loci lack β cluster genes. the presence of a β cluster in the lobe-finned fish and tetrapods, and its absence in fugu and zebrafish suggest that the β cluster either evolved in the lineage that led to the lobe-finned fish and tetrapods, or was already present in the common ancestor of these vertebrates and was subsequently lost in the teleost lineage before the divergence of the fugu and zebrafish lineages.

the two pcdh loci in the fugu and zebrafish show significant differences in their gene content and organization. for instance, frpcdh <dig> cluster is highly degenerate compared to the zebrafish pcdh1; as a result, it contains only three α genes compared to ten α genes in zebrafish pcdh <dig> cluster  <cit> . more strikingly, the fugu pcdh <dig> locus completely lacks a γ cluster , whereas the zebrafish pcdh <dig> locus contains a γ cluster with at least  <dig> genes  <cit> . thus, unlike the zebrafish genome which contains two pcdhγ clusters, fugu genome contains a single pcdhγ cluster that is located in the pcdh <dig> locus. the whole-genome sequence of a second pufferfish, tetraodon nigroviridis, has recently been completed  <cit> . to determine whether tetraodon contains a single pcdhγ cluster like the fugu, we performed a blastx search of the tetraodon genome database and discovered that tetraodon also contains two sets of α constant exons belonging to two putative pcdh clusters but only a single set of γ constant exons similar to fugu. thus the second copy of pcdhγ cluster associated with the pcdh <dig> locus seems to have been lost before the divergence of the fugu and tetraodon. the highly degenerate nature of the pcdh <dig> locus in pufferfishes is consistent with the trend of pufferfish genome towards compaction. the complete loss of the second copy of pcdhγ cluster in pufferfish suggests that these pcdhγ genes may be redundant. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the loss of this cluster in pufferfishes might have an effect on their phenotype with regard to the structure and function of the central nervous system.

phylogenetic relationships of fugu, zebrafish and coelacanth protocadherin genes
the frpcdh <dig> locus contains  <dig> α genes and at least  <dig> γ genes, as compared to  <dig> α genes and at least  <dig> γ genes in the zebrafish pcdh <dig> locus  <cit> . in order to determine the phylogenetic relationships of these genes and to trace the evolutionary history of pcdh clusters in teleosts, we performed phylogenetic analyses using the neighbor-joining method. we used only ec1-ec <dig> sequences, instead of the entire ectodomain region  for the analyses, because the c-terminal ectodomain  of some fugu and zebrafish genes have undergone extensive regional sequence homogenization due to repeated gene conversion events , and using such homogenized regions would bias the tree and the inferred relationships. we first determined the relationships among fugu pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig> genes . the topology of the gene tree shows that frpcdh2α cluster is mainly comprised of three major paralog groups, frpcdh2α3– <dig>  frpcdh2α8– <dig> and frpcdh2α26– <dig>  the three α genes in the pcdh <dig> cluster, frpcdh1α1-α <dig>  are the inter-locus paralog of frpcdh2α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> of the pcdh <dig> locus, respectively. frpcdh2γ cluster also consists of three large paralog groups, frpcdh2γ1– <dig>  frpcdh2γ19–32' and frpcdh2γ 33'-36'. in addition, pcdhγ cluster also contains two individual genes, frpcdh2γ <dig> and frpcdh2γ37', that seem to be distantly related to the other genes in the cluster, suggesting they are generated from ancient gene duplications. interestingly, frpcdh2γ37' appears to be more closely related to the frpcdh1α <dig> and frpcdh2α <dig> in the pcdhα cluster . notably, such a phylogenetic relationship between pcdhα and pcdhγ clusters is also evident in mammalian pcdh clusters  <cit> . the two genes, c <dig> and c <dig>  at the end of mammalian pcdhα cluster are shown to be evolutionarily closer to the last three genes, c3-c <dig>  of the pcdhγ cluster than any other genes in the pcdhα cluster  <cit> . interestingly, phylogenetic analyses show that frpcdh1α <dig>  frpcdh2α <dig> and frpcdh2γ <dig> indeed belong to the mammalian c1-c <dig> gene group . the remarkable conservation of these genes suggests that they may play an important role in protocadherin functions in all vertebrates. the overall structure of fugu pcdh cluster gene tree is highly similar to that of zebrafish, which also contains three large paralog groups each of pcdhα and γ clusters  <cit> .

to explore the orthology of fugu and zebrafish pcdh genes and their phylogenetic relationships with pcdh genes from other vertebrate groups, we next performed phylogenetic analyses of fugu and zebrafish pcdh genes together with pcdh genes from coelacanth. coelacanth was selected as a representative of lobe-finned fish and tetrapod lineages since the single pcdh cluster in coelacanth is likely to be the closest to the ancestral pcdh locus of the two teleost lineages. we analyzed pcdhα  and pcdhγ  clusters separately.

as shown in fig 3a, pcdhα genes of fugu, zebrafish and coelacanth comprise three large paralog/ortholog groups. the first group  contains genes localized at the two ends of fugu and zebrafish pcdhα clusters, including fugu frpcdh1α1– <dig>  frpcdh2α1– <dig>  frpcdh2α <dig> and zebrafish drpcdh1α1– <dig>  drpcdh1α <dig>  drpcdh2α1– <dig>  drpcdh2α <dig>  besides all but one of the genes  in the coelacanth pcdhα cluster. these fugu and zebrafish genes are further divided into four subgroups. the first subgroup  consists of two fugu inter-locus paralogs, frpcdh1α <dig> and frpcdh2α <dig>  zebrafish drpcdh1α <dig> and lmpcdhα <dig>  the second subgroup  is comprised of two fugu inter-locus paralogs, frpcdh1α <dig>  frpcdh2α <dig> and their zebrafish orthologs, drpcdh1α <dig> and drpcdh2α <dig>  the third subgroup  contains fugu frpcdh1α <dig> and frpcdh2α <dig> and their zebrafish orthologs drpcdh1α <dig> and drpcdh2α <dig>  as well as the coelacanth ortholog, lmpcdha <dig>  an interesting feature of these pcdh genes is that they seem to be resistant to gene duplication. in spite of the heavy turnover of genes in their neighborhood , they have been conserved as single-copy genes throughout the evolution of these vertebrates. this suggests that they may play a fundamental role in the central nervous system. the fourth subgroup  contains fugu frpcdh2α3– <dig> and zebrafish drpcdh2α2– <dig>  no direct orthologous relationship can be identified between individual genes in this subgroup; instead, frpcdh2α3– <dig> as a paralog group seems to be orthologous to drpcdh2α5– <dig>  this type of phylogenetic relationship indicates that subsequent to the divergence of the two species, the ancestral paralogs have undergone independent lineage-specific gene duplications, giving rise to a multi-gene paralog group in each species. this phylogenetic tree also suggests that the subgroup ia and ic are derived from a common ancestor, while subgroup ib and id share a common ancestor. except lmpcdhα <dig> and lmpcdhα <dig>  other coelacanth genes in this group do not show any direct orthology to fugu and zebrafish genes, suggesting that these genes are either specific to lobe-finned fish and tetrapods or have been lost from the teleost fish lineage.

the second paralog/ortholog group  in the pcdhα phylogenetic tree comprises fugu frpcdh2α26– <dig>  zebrafish drpcdh1α3– <dig>  drpcdh2α26– <dig>  and a single coelacanth gene, lmpcdhα <dig>  the subtrees of this group show that a subset of genes in the zebrafish pcdh1α locus, the drpcdh1α, are generated from an ancestral paralog of drpcdh1α <dig> through multiple gene duplication events in the zebrafish lineage. no fugu ortholog for zebrafish drpcdh1α3- <dig> genes is found in frpcdh <dig> locus, presumably due to the independent loss of this paralog group of genes in fugu. on the other hand, frpcdh2α31– <dig> appear to be derived from a single common ancestor through lineage-specific duplications in fugu. a single fugu gene, frpcdh2α <dig>  seems to share a common ancestor with a cluster of zebrafish genes, drpcdh2α, indicating that while the fugu gene was retained as single-copy, the zebrafish gene has undergone multiple duplications. the fourth subset of genes in this paralog/ortholog group consists of multiple fugu and zebrafish genes including frpcdh2α26– <dig>  drpcdh2α and drpcdh1α <dig>  however, the orthologous relationship between these subsets of genes cannot be inferred with confidence since the bootstrap values at their branch nodes are rather low . as these paralog/ortholog group genes are closely related and are clearly segregated from other fugu and zebrafish pcdh paralog/ortholog group genes, we consider the whole group as one large paralog/ortholog group. the evolution of such paralog/ortholog groups is likely to have involved many rounds of lineage-specific gene duplication and degeneration. it appears that lmpcdhα <dig> is a distant ortholog of this group . interestingly, this coelacanth gene also shares common ancestry with the entire mammalian α cluster   <cit> , suggesting that this paralog/ortholog group of fugu and zebrafish genes is perhaps orthologous to the entire mammalian pcdhα cluster.

the third paralog/ortholog group of pcdhα genes  seems to be teleost-specific, containing only fugu frpcdh2α8– <dig> and zebrafish drpcdh2α8– <dig>  these genes can further be divided into three subgroups. the first subgroup  contains fugu frpcdh2α <dig> and its zebrafish ortholog drpcdh2α <dig>  whereas the other two subgroups  that contain multiple fugu and zebrafish paralogs do not exhibit any manifest individual orthologous relationships. however, it is clear that fugu frpcdh2α  and frpcdh2α  as paralog subgroups are orthologous to zebrafish drpcdh2α19– <dig> and drpcdh2α9– <dig>  respectively.

similar to pcdhα genes, the pcdhγ genes also form three large paralog/ortholog groups . orthology between multi-gene groups  seems also to be a common feature of the pcdh1γ cluster. for example, the fugu frpcdh2γ32'  is apparently orthologous to the entire zebrafish paralog group drpcdh2γ28– <dig>  whereas the fugu frpcdh2γ1– <dig>  as a paralog group is orthologous to a zebrafish drpcdh2γ1– <dig>  additionally, orthology between two individual genes from two species is also observed in the pcdhγ cluster. for instance, fugu frpcdh2γ <dig>  is clearly an ortholog of zebrafish drpcdh2γ <dig>  consistent with the previous study  <cit> , the phylogenetic tree for pcdhγ cluster also revealed that coelacanth pcdhγ genes comprise five paralog groups , of which four, lmpcdhγ, lmpcdhγ11– <dig>  lmpcdhγ and lmpcdhβ1– <dig> are closely related to each other, whereas the fifth group, lmpcdhγ21– <dig>  is more closely related to fugu frpcdh2γ37' and zebrafish drpcdh1γ <dig> . such a phylogenetic relationship suggests that a massive expansion of pcdhγ genes has occurred in the coelacanth lineage subsequent to the divergence of these species.

orthology between an individual gene in one species and a group of genes in another and between groups of genes in two species rather than between individual genes is a characteristic of multigene families which have experienced continuous events of lineage-specific gene duplications and losses. pcdh cluster is a typical example of such a dynamic cluster of genes in vertebrates. the pcdh clusters from fugu and zebrafish include instances of orthology between a single fugu gene and a group of paralogous zebrafish genes  and between entire paralog groups of fugu and zebrafish genes . these types of phylogenetic relationships among pcdh genes in fugu and zebrafish illustrate the exceptionally dynamic evolutionary changes at the pcdh loci in the teleost fish lineage following the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication event. although the single pcdh cluster in mammals and the coelacanth have experienced gene duplications and losses, the extent of turnover is much lower than that in the fugu and zebrafish. such variations in the complement of pcdh genes show that pcdh clusters are much more dynamic in teleost fishes than in mammals and lobe-finned fishes. since teleost fishes are the most species-rich and most diverse group of vertebrates, it is likely that the evolutionarily dynamic pcdh clusters in teleosts might have contributed to morphological and behavioral diversity of teleost fishes.

regional gene conversion in fugu protocadherin locus
a striking feature of fugu pcdh cluster genes observed during the assembly of cosmid and bac sequences is the highly similar 3' region of variable exons  shared by multiple paralogs. these paralogs, which can be differentiated by their divergent 5' sequences, are generally located at close proximity on the chromosome and segregate into subclusters. we have identified three such paralog subclusters in each of the fugu pcdh2α  and pcdh2γ  clusters, respectively. to investigate the extent of sequence similarity and differences in the 5' and 3' regions of these genes, we aligned protein and nucleotide sequences of individual paralog subclusters and calculated their pair-wise amino acid and nucleotide sequence identities based on the multiple alignment. while the sequence identity of the less similar upstream region ranges from  <dig> to 80% at both amino acid and nucleotide levels, the 3' sequences are nearly 100% identical among members in each subcluster . the two distinct regions are separated by a discrete boundary located at the coding sequence for domains ec <dig> or ec <dig> in different subclusters . because purifying selection for protein function does not act on synonymous sites, the astonishingly high sequence similarity at the nucleotide level is thus unlikely to be due to a greater functional constraint on the protein sequence. instead, such homogenized sequences could have arisen from repeated regional gene conversion events. there is evidence that tandem gene arrays tend to embark on gene conversion that leads to sequence homogenization among paralogs  <cit> . indeed, zebrafish and human pcdh paralogs have been shown to have undergone frequent gene conversions, resulting in substantial sequence homogenization among paralogs  <cit> . however, gene conversions do not seem to be an inherent characteristic of all pcdh clusters, because no gene conversion signatures have been uncovered at the coelacanth pcdh locus  <cit> . to determine whether the high similarity regions shared by fugu paralogs are generated through gene conversion events, we compared the gc content at codon third positions  between the 5' low similarity and the 3' high similarity regions among paralogs in each group. it is known that repeated gene conversions usually cause an increase of gc <dig> in converted regions  <cit> . the gc <dig> in 3' regions of all the paralog groups is above 50%, and is significantly higher than that for their corresponding 5' regions , indicating that these high similarity regions are indeed the result of gene conversion events.

pcdhs have been proposed to provide molecular diversities for neuron-neuron connections through the combinatorial interaction of protocadherin proteins. for classical cadherins, the trans-homophilic interaction  is mainly mediated by the ec <dig> domain  <cit> . although yet to be demonstrated experimentally, it is generally believed that pcdhs also engage in a similar form of homophilic interaction as the classic cadherins. however, unlike classic cadherins which contain five ectodomains in their extracellular region, the extracellular region of pcdhs contains six ectodomains. it is possible that the molecular diversifying signals of pcdhs in fugu are encoded by the extracellular ec1-ec <dig> domains since this region is more divergent among individual pcdhs as compared to the highly homologous c-terminal extracellular domains. this is consistent with the observation that the ec <dig> and ec <dig> domains of zebrafish and mammalian pcdhs seldom undergo sequence homogenization processes and thus provide the most diversifying signals for the molecules  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown recently that ec <dig> and ec <dig> of mammalian pcdhs undergo diversity-enhancing positive diversifying selection  <cit> . collectively, these observations imply that the n-terminal ectodomains of pcdhs play a crucial role in mediating neuronal connections in the brain. furthermore, in contrast to the virtually 100% identical c-terminal sequences of paralogs in the same fugu subclusters, the converted regions are highly divergent between subclusters. the consensus sequences for the converted regions between different subclusters of pcdh2α and pcdh2γ exhibit on average only  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities, respectively. this implies that the converted regions in different subclusters may have undergone adaptive selection and acquired diverse functions specific to each subcluster. in contrast to fugu pcdh <dig> cluster genes, the pcdh <dig> cluster genes do not contain any signature for gene conversion.

reconstruction of protocadherin clusters in ancestral fish lineage
based on the inferred phylogenetic relationships of fugu, zebrafish and coelacanth pcdh genes, we have reconstructed models of the duplicate teleost pcdh clusters in the common ancestor of fugu and zebrafish, and the single pcdh cluster in the fish lineage prior to the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication event . these models illustrate the dynamic nature of the pcdh locus in vertebrates. the pcdh loci in teleost fishes and the coelacanth have repeatedly experienced lineage-specific gene losses and gene duplications. the lineage-specific tandem gene duplication is rather dramatic in the pcdh <dig> locus of teleost fishes, giving rise to at least  <dig> and  <dig> genes in fugu and zebrafish respectively, compared to  <dig> genes in the coelacanth. according to our model, the single pcdh cluster in the fish lineage prior to the whole genome duplication contained at least six pcdhα paralog groups  and ten pcdhγ paralog groups  . in contrast, coelacanth pcdh cluster contains orthologs for only three of these fish pcdhα genes and one of the fish pcdhγ genes. on the other hand, two of the coelacanth pcdhα paralog groups  and one pcdh paralog group containing lmβ1– <dig> and lmγ1– <dig> have no apparent orthologs in the ancestral fish pcdh cluster. these comparisons show that the pcdh loci have been subject to dynamic changes since the divergence of the lobe-finned fish and ray-finned fish lineages and have been continuously undergoing lineage-specific degeneration and tandem duplications. characterization of pcdh cluster from a more basal vertebrate, such as a cartilaginous fish, should shed light on the ancestral state of pcdh cluster and help to reconstruct the evolutionary changes in the basal lobe-finned fishes and teleost fishes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified two unlinked fugu pcdh loci that collectively contain at least  <dig> pcdh genes. the gene content of the two fugu pcdh loci is quite different from that of the two pcdh loci in zebrafish. we show that following the 'fish-specific' whole-genome duplication, regional sequence homogenization due to repeated lineage-specific gene conversion processes, secondary gene losses and tandem gene duplications are the major factors affecting the evolution of pcdh clusters in teleosts. based on phylogenetic analyses, we predict that there were at least six α and ten γ genes  in the pcdh locus of the ancestral fish genome prior to the whole-genome duplication event. elucidating the origin and evolutionary dynamics of pcdh clusters in different lineage of vertebrates is an important endeavor as it may help to uncover the molecular code for the complex central nervous system of vertebrates.
