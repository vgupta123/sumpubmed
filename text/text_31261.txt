BACKGROUND
probiotics, especially lactic acid bacteria have beneficial effects on consumers health as suggested in  <dig>  <cit> . it was believed that bacteria mainly controlled infections caused by enteric pathogens and regulated toxoaemia, thereby improving health and influencing mortality. meanwhile it has been known that some of the positive effects on consumers health are the improvement in the microflora balance in the gut, the stimulation of the immune system, and aiding the organism to fight pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . a large part of interest was concentrated on the use of strains of the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, even if there are also other bacteria with probiotic effects, e.g. some propionibacteria.

the above mentioned properties are also the basis for a microorganism to be labelled probiotic. there are different definitions worldwide but they are similar in content. one of the criteria for a probiotic strain is its resistance to acidity and gastric solutions in the human gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . it is therefore important, to evaluate the resistance of a potential probiotic strain to the acidic and gastric environment in the intestine.

because of high costs and ethical as well as safety regulations for clinical studies, screening survival is easier to simulate in vitro. a simple test is to incubate the bacterial cells in acidic or bile salt solutions for a defined period and count the number of surviving cells. in a further step, the simulation is carried out in agitated flasks, combining acidity and gastric solutions followed by an estimation of surviving cells over the entire simulation. this is a more realistic replication of the conditions in the intestine  <cit> . another system, the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem , consists of  <dig> to  <dig> serially connected ph controlled bioreactors  <cit> . the setup is quite complex and demands absolute anaerobic conditions. furthermore, the absorption of metabolites and water is not simulated. this was overcome by using dialysis membranes as described by marteau et al.  <cit> .

recently, a new system using a single bioreactor was developed to study the stomach-intestine passage  <cit> . the system allowed the ph to be altered inside a single reactor and was adapted to the retention times in the different regions of the stomach-intestine passage.

lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> was recently isolated from infant faeces  <cit> . it produces a bacteriocin which is active against clostridium sp. and their spores. l. gasseri belongs to the so called "acidophilus"-group and several independent studies identified these strains as inhabitants of the skin and intestine  <cit> . in previous experiments, it has already been shown in vitro that l. gasseri k <dig> survived in an acidic environment and with  <dig> % bile salts  <cit> . these findings make the strain interesting as a possible probiotic.

in this study, a single bioreactor system based on the work of sumeri et al.  <cit>  was used to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> and eight bifidobacterium strains from our collection. we were able to compare the results for l. gasseri k <dig> with a study performed in piglets  <cit>  which allowed the assessment of a correlation between the in-vitro study with results from in-vivo experiments.

the retention times and ph used in this study were based on data from the literature. several methods exist for measuring the ph in the intestine  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the ph values in the different parts of the intestine as measured by the heidelberg capsule  <cit> . retention times can be calculated either by using marker substances  or by radio telemetry capsules such as the heidelberg capsule  <cit> . however, capsules usually have longer retention times than chemical markers. table  <dig> lists some of the retention times found in the literature  <cit> .

RESULTS
acid resistance screening
the aim of an initial series of tests was to obtain an overview of the acid resistance of eight bifidobacteria strains. figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the survival of these strains using contour plots made with sigmaplot. bifidobacterium dentium  showed the least acid resistance. between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  there was no difference in survival and the concentration of cells dropped by more than  <dig> log within  <dig> minutes. bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis was more resistant up to  <dig> min at ph  <dig> , but then decreased by about  <dig> log when incubated for  <dig> minutes . at a ph between  <dig>  and  <dig>  the decrease was less than  <dig> log after  <dig> minutes.

all the other tested bifidobacterium strains  showed a similar but different pattern from b. animalis subsp. lactis . they had a short survival time below ph  <dig>  and survived in higher numbers above ph  <dig> .

with the aim of developing a method to simulate the gi in the bioreactor, a further test was done with one strain. to observe the influence of a food matrix, concentrated b. longum subsp. infantis was resuspended in skim milk before inoculating into acidic solutions. as shown in the right-hand column of figure  <dig>  milk had a direct effect on the survival of the strain. between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  the bacteria survived for  <dig> min with a reduction of log  <dig>  below ph  <dig>  the survival rate decreased to about log  <dig>  the decrease in survival below ph  <dig>  was rapid but regular over time. at ph  <dig>  and above, the strain was resistant for at least  <dig> minutes.

the left-hand column of figure  <dig> shows the same strain without added skim milk. at a ph above  <dig> , there was no influence on the survival of the bacteria. however, below ph  <dig>  the survival decreased depending on the duration of incubation. between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  the strain had already decreased by about log  <dig>  after  <dig> min incubation, there was almost a linear decrease in survival with decreasing ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

simulation in the bioreactor
most systems described in the literature consist of several reaction vessels, e.g. the shime  <cit> . other studies used immobilized cells with three reactors  <cit>  or a dialysis system  <cit> . based on the work of sumeri et al.  <cit>  and the collected data of the conditions in the intestinal passage we were able to limit the simulation to one vessel. together with the data from the acid resistance screening, the selection of a possible starting ph and broth composition in the simulator could be chosen. the resulting simulation parameters are shown in figure  <dig> and described in the material and methods section. during the experimental stage of this study, sumeri et al.  <cit>  developed a similar system to evaluate lactobacillus sp. in a stomach-intestine passage simulation.

the software package "lucullus" was an excellent tool to control the ph and the process according to the developed simulation. selecting the medium in the bioreactor was simplified by choosing the corresponding growth medium for the strains, supplemented with skim milk, functioning as a simulated food matrix. afterwards, it was acidified to the starting ph and supplemented with enzyme solutions as described in materials and methods. the simulations were carried out serially, one per day. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  the strains used for the simulation are listed in table  <dig>  and were standardized to an od <dig> of  <dig>  prior to inoculation.

bifidobacterium adolescentis was inoculated as described above at an initial concentration of  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> and decreased almost linearly to below  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> after  <dig> hours. b. breve and b. longum strains had an initial concentration between  <dig> and  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> and diminished to below  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> within the first  <dig> minutes. b. animalis subsp. lactis  <dig> survived to approximately 15% of the initial average cfu of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  there was a rapid decrease in survival of b. longum subsp. infantis over the first  <dig> min. afterwards the survival decreased only slowly from  <dig> to  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> 

in a later phase, lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> was included in the study since several projects were running at this time at our institute with this strain. lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> was inoculated at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> and after  <dig> h simulation a concentration of  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> living cells was still present in the culture media . the highest reduction in survival was within the first  <dig> hours and began immediately after the addition of gastric juice and bile salts. within this time, there was a reduction of living cells by log  <dig>  during the rest of the simulation time, there was only a log  <dig> reduction of living cells.

the preparation of the inoculum of l. gasseri k <dig> in a  <dig> ml culture volume was also evaluated. the results of the experiments are shown in figure  <dig>  with  <dig> ml culture the decrease in living cells was about log  <dig> whereas the decrease with a  <dig> ml culture was only log  <dig> over the whole incubation time. however,  <dig> h after addition of bile salts and pancreatic juice, the decrease in cell counts was similar for both volumes.

discussion
when harvesting a culture after a given incubation time, the growth phase of each bacterial strain can be different since all have different growth dynamics. in order to obtain cells at approximately the same growth phase, preliminary experiments were performed . an incubation time of  <dig> h for the pre-culture was suitable for all tested strains except bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis which needed to be incubated for only  <dig> h.

the acid tolerance screening  was performed to evaluate the effect of ph independently of other conditions. bifidobacterium dentium was highly sensitive to acid and therefore would possibly not survive the passage through the stomach. the strain was therefore not included in the simulation experiments. the b. longum strains  did not yield much better results than b. dentium . however, close to ph  <dig> they were more resistant than b. dentium.

b. longum subsp. infantis is one of the first species to populate the human intestine shortly after birth  <cit> . based on the experiments in this study, however, the tested b. longum subsp. infantis strain would only be able to pass the infant stomach in high numbers if the transition time in the acidic stomach was very short. the survival of the selected strain in the tested environment was too low for successful passage in high numbers. when the strain was resuspended in skim milk, survival increased . this could be an indication that human milk helps b. longum subsp. infantis strains to pass the stomach-intestine passage with at a higher survival rate.

the protective effects of milk proteins in the digestive system have already been described in the literature  <cit> . protection with milk proteins has also been shown in this study . with the appropriate matrix or even a carrier, probiotic bacteria could safely pass through the stomach to the intestines to reach their site of action.

b. adolescentis strains that populate the human intestine at a later age, had slightly higher resistance than b. longum subsp. infantis which may explain the reduction of the latter during the progress of the human infant to adulthood  <cit> .

the most interesting strain was b. animalis subsp. lactis, which was the least sensitive strain in our study. this ph-resistant strain has a great potential for use in foods as a probiotic supplement since a higher number of bacterial cells would survive the passage. however, to use this strain as probiotic, more studies have to be performed in order to achieve the probiotic status according to the definition of klaenhammer  <cit> .

in our study, the ingestion of a food matrix was simulated in an initial environment of acidified milk and growth medium. the added simulated gastric solution and oxygen during the stomach phase increased the stress. during the simulated passage to the small intestine the oxygen was replaced by nitrogen and the medium was neutralized to ph  <dig> . the addition of the pancreatic solution and bile salts completed the passage into the small intestine. this in-vitro system did not take into account that in in vivo digestion, enzymes are activated and inactivated and other substances, e.g. bile salts are reabsorbed. sumeri et al.  <cit>  found a partial solution to bypass this problem. they diluted the content of the reactor with a specially designed dilution medium. another possibility would be to precipitate the bile salts at the end of simulation of the small intestine to imitate the enterohepatic circuit. this could be performed with calcium ions  <cit> . removing the bile salts would better simulate the environment of the colon and might even allow bifidobacteria to proliferate.

in our study, the remaining bile salts and pancreatic juice in the simulation led to an additional stress on bacteria which probably altered the true characteristics of the strains in vivo.

the starting cfu in the simulation varied within one log cfu even though the adjustment of od <dig> of the inoculum was previously tested with the bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis strains. the bifidobacteria used in this study showed a tendency to form clusters that may result in reduced cfu . in another study, the formation of clusters could be related to decreasing ph during growth  <cit> . these clusters are usually counted as one colony on a plate.

all b. longum and b. breve strains died very rapidly at the beginning of the simulation and were below the detection limit of the plating method within a few hours  which was to be expected from the results of the screening experiment above .

on the other hand, b. longum subsp. infantis  <dig> decreased rapidly at the beginning of simulation but after the addition of pancreatic juice and bile salts and a change to an anaerobic environment, the reduction rate decreased. our study suggests that this strain is well adapted to the conditions in the intestine but needs to be ingested in high numbers to survive the conditions in the stomach . as mentioned above, b. longum subsp. infantis strains belong to the first group of bacteria populating the intestine of infants  <cit> .

in contrast to b. longum subsp. infantis, b. adolescentis decreased almost linearly during the  <dig> h simulation. there was no detectable interruption when the conditions in the fermenter changed. based on the experiments for the acid tolerance screening, this result was unexpected.

however, this might be related to the testing conditions where the bile salt and gastric juice concentrations remained at the initial level and were not diluted as they would be in vivo. in a future experiment, it should be evaluated whether the dilution method developed by sumeri et al.  <cit>  would stabilize the cell counts of b. adolescentis during the  <dig> h simulation period in the intestine.

in our study, we also evaluated the stomach-intestine passage of lactobacillus gasseri k <dig>  the strain has already been evaluated for survival in vivo in piglets  <cit> . therefore, it was possible to compare our in-vitro results with data from in vivo experiments.

bogovic et al.  <cit>  fed piglets over a period of  <dig> days with 5* <dig> cfu day- <dig> of l. gasseri k <dig>  this resulted in approx. 7* <dig> cfu g- <dig> in the faeces during the feeding period. it has to be taken into account that the concentration of bacteria was diluted before it finally arrived at the stomach-intestine passage. in a rough approximation, we estimated that about 1% arrived at the passage. this allowed us to compare the results of this piglet study with the end of our simulation.

as shown in figure  <dig>  l. gasseri k <dig> had a cell concentration of approximately 5* <dig> cfu ml- <dig> after the  <dig> h simulation period  which is similar to the concentration in the faeces of the piglets. this suggests that the simulation model used in this study could be a helpful tool to estimate the effects of the passage in an in-vitro model prior using expensive in vivo models. the model could be further optimized by diluting the bile salts and pancreatic juice as described by sumeri et al.  <cit> . to simulate the activation and deactivation of enzymes a suitable method has still to be found.

when only  <dig> ml medium was used for the inoculum of l. gasseri k <dig>  the culture survived the simulation better . both volumes had a similar initial cell count. both volumes were inoculated by  <dig> ml. therefore, the culture with  <dig> ml volume was in an earlier stage of growth than the  <dig> ml culture. these results were an indication of the growth phase dependency of the culture for during stress.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we were able to show that the system to simulate the stomach-intestine passage developed by sumeri et al.  <cit>  was suitable for the assessment of survival of  <dig> bifidobacterium strains and lactobacillus gasseri k <dig> even though we did not simulate the removal of gastric juice and bile salts. for l. gasseri k <dig> we were able to compare the results with an in-vivo study on piglets and obtained similar results.

the single reactor system presented here allows a more straightforward identification of the ideal growth phase for any possible probiotic strain which is required to pass the stomach-intestine passage than if it had to be performed with other systems with a difficult setup.

the study also showed that all tested bifidobacterium strains, except for b. animalis subsp. lactis, would require protective agents to survive the passage through the stomach-intestine in high numbers. this could be done using an appropriate food matrix or encapsulation of the cells.
