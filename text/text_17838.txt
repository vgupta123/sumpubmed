BACKGROUND
in the last decade, genome sequencing projects of economically or biologically important species have been a major driving force for biological research. after a genome is sequenced and annotated, functional characterization of genes that are important for development, cellular processes, or stress response becomes a major effort in the scientific community. classically, gene function is determined using two opposite but complementary approaches: reverse genetics, which consists of deciphering the function of a gene by analyzing phenotypic effects of up- and down-regulations of the gene ; and forward genetics, which consists of analyzing a phenotype  of a modified organism to identify gene responsible for this particular phenotype .

transposable elements  are mobile dna sequences found in both prokaryote and eukaryote genomes. they usually represent a large proportion of the genome and under particular circumstances such as various stresses, some tes become active and transpose themselves to other locations of the genome  <cit> . tes are classified into two categories: class i retrotransposons move following a “copy and paste” manner and class ii dna transposons following a “cut and paste” manner. due to their mobility and depending on the location of their insertions, they may impact gene expression and gene function. therefore, transposons are considered as a driving force of evolution and key players in adaptive mechanisms. in addition to specific endogenous transposons, exogenous transposable elements have been frequently used to develop numerous insertional mutant populations such as in mouse  <cit> , yeast  <cit> , nematode  <cit> , fruit fly  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . the development of insertional mutant populations in combination with forward genetic approaches have been widely used in functional genomics studies.

medicago truncatula is a model plant to study legume biology and has been studied in different research areas such as seed biology  <cit> , leaf development  <cit> , symbiotic nitrogen fixation  <cit> , secondary metabolite accumulation  <cit> , response to stresses  <cit> , and plant pathogens  <cit> . with the recent completion of a draft genome and its annotation  <cit> , more than  <dig>  gene loci have been identified and need to be functionally characterized. large-scale mutant populations have been developed, including a tnt <dig> insertional mutant population  <cit> , in order to accelerate functional genomics studies. the tnt <dig> mutant population was generated by transforming m. truncatula r <dig> with a well-studied tobacco retrotransposon, called tnt <dig>  <cit> . tnt <dig> is a retrotransposon with a long open reading frame  in the center encoding enzymes that function in replication and transposition. the center region is flanked by 610 bp long terminal repeats  in the same orientation . during its transposition, tnt <dig> usually introduces a 5-bp target-site duplication  sequence on the two sides of the insertion site  <cit>  . the high efficiency of transposition of tnt <dig> during tissue culture enabled generation of a nearly saturated mutant population of m. truncatula genome  <cit> , which has been widely used in reverse genetics approaches. in order to enhance the use of the tnt <dig> mutant population as a tool for forward genetics studies, efforts to identify flanking sequence tags  of the tnt <dig> inserts have been made to ultimately identify the disrupted genes in different lines. high-throughput identification of fst sequences have been initiated using thermal asymmetric interlaced -pcr-based approaches but technical limitations resulted in partial identification of tnt <dig> inserts.

recent improvement of the throughput and decrease in experiment cost of next-generation sequencing  technologies permit the use of ngs to identify te locations, fst sequences and ultimately disrupted genes at the genome-wide scale. although several algorithms have been developed to identify te insertion sites using whole genome re-sequencing data, most of them are not making full use of the information from short reads  <cit> . whereas some of these algorithms detect insertions only by searching for cross reads pairs, where one read is aligned to the genome and its mate aligned to the inserted te sequence  <cit> , other algorithms only use clipped read pairs, in which a single read containing the te sequence along with flanking reference sequence  <cit> .

in this study, we present a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, called itis , which was designed to identify flanking sequences of inserted transposable elements and ultimately genes disrupted from paired-end ngs data. based on simulated and case study datasets, we demonstrated equal or superior sensitivity and specificity of our pipeline in comparison to other methods. by applying itis to a ngs dataset from a m. truncatula mutant line containing tnt <dig> insertions, we validated our method in a plant system by identifying and confirming te insertion sites in the genome.

RESULTS
design and implementation of itis
itis requires three sequence files as input:  reference genome sequence,  transposable element  sequence, and  paired-end  short reads generated from the re-sequenced genome that contains novel te insertions. the overall design of itis is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the first step of the itis pipeline is to map pe reads to the reference genome sequences and the transposable element sequence using short read alignment program bwa  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
overall design and workflow of itis. black lines represent genome sequences, red lines represent te sequences and green lines represent target site duplication sequences. paired-end reads are denoted by arrow lines. the reads from the same genome region are framed by parallelograms.



as second step, itis processes the alignment file and classifies pe reads into two categories. if both pe reads are mapped to the reference genome, but not the te, they are regarded as background pe reads. background pe reads do not provide information to determine insertion sites, but their numbers at the insertion loci are used to determine whether the insertion loci are heterozygous or homozygous. if at least one of the pe reads overlaps at least 20 bp with the insertion te sequence, the pe reads are regarded as informative pe reads . based on how the insertion junction is covered, the informative pe reads can be further classified into two types . the first type is cross pe reads, in which one end is completely mapped to the reference genome and the other end mapped to the insertion te. the second type is clipped pe reads, in which at least one end covers both the reference genome and the insertion te sequence. clipped pe reads are used to determine the exact nucleotide position where the te is inserted.

as third step, itis uses the genome coordinates of the informative pe reads to locate the cluster of informative reads. each cluster indicates a candidate te insertion site. in order to generate a list of insertion sites that are most likely genuine, itis uses a series of filters to discard possible false candidates by requiring that the average mapping quality of informative pe reads being at least  <dig> , the average sequencing depth around the insertion being between  <dig> and  <dig>  the number of supporting pe reads being at least  <dig>  and both ends of the insertion must be supported by at least one read pair. clipped pe reads are then used to determine the exact genomic location of the insertion.

finally, for each detected insertion of te, itis determines the likelihood of the insertion site being heterozygous or homozygous by using the number of informative pe reads  and the number of background pe reads . itis was implemented in perl and is freely available at http://bioinformatics.psc.ac.cn/software/itis. itis is a standalone software that runs in a linux/unix system from the command line.

evaluation of itis with a simulated dataset
to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the itis pipeline, we created a simulated benchmark dataset. an artificial transposon insertion mutant genome was created by in silico simulation with  <dig> tnt <dig> transposons  being randomly inserted into the m. truncatula a <dig> genome . assuming that all insertion sites are heterozygous, equal amount of 100 bp pe reads were randomly extracted using the pirs program  <cit>  from the mutant genome and the reference genome to reach different coverages from 3x , 5x , 10x , 15x , 20x  to 25x . these simulated reads were used as input to itis and the candidate insertion sites identified by the algorithm were compared to the known locations of the  <dig> insertions. by requiring that both ends of a te were covered by at least one cross read pair or clipped read pair, we observed that at 3x genome coverage,  <dig>  insertions could be correctly identified, among which  <dig> were assigned to the exact insertion positions, and  <dig> were located within 100 bp from the insertion sites . at 10x coverage, itis identified  <dig>  insertions. however, the rate of identified insertions appeared to have reached plateau at 10x coverage and no additional insertion was recovered with higher genome coverage. after close examination, we found that the remaining undiscovered te sites were inserted in repetitive sequence regions and, thus, could not be identified by itis with high confidence. these results demonstrated the high sensitivity of itis, which performed well with relatively low genome coverage  by identifying more than 90% of heterozygous insertions.figure  <dig> 
performance evaluation of itis and four other algorithms at different genome coverage using a simulated dataset. the recovery rates of known insertions were compared among itis, relocate, retroseq, temp and tif. identified insertions are considered false positive if their distance from the known insertion site exceeds 500 bp.



we also compared the performance of itis to four other similar algorithms: relocate  <cit> , retroseq  <cit> , temp  <cit>  and tif  <cit>  using the same simulated dataset as input. as shown in figure  <dig>  itis outperformed the other four algorithms in terms of sensitivity and specificity. itis was particularly effective when the genome coverage was relatively low  by accurately identifying the highest number of insertions. when the coverage was higher , temp and retroseq correctly identified similar number of insertions. however, retroseq and temp only allowed approximate locations of insertions within  <dig> or 500 bp to the insertion sites, whereas itis identified the exact insertion sites, showing better specificity. even though tif was able to correctly determine the exact insertion positions of the majority of the te insertions, it was not as sensitive as itis at low coverage and displayed the highest rate of false positive insertions .

identification of tnt <dig> insertions from a m. truncatula mutant line
to further validate the effectiveness of itis, we applied itis to a m. truncatula mutant line from the tnt <dig> insertion mutant population. this mutant population is ideal for testing itis performance because of the two main challenges present in most of biological systems:  the presence of multiple tnt <dig> inserts within the genome at the homozygous and heterozygous states and  this mutant population originated from a slightly different genotype  than the reference genome a <dig>  which was used by itis in our study. we selected mutant line, nf <dig>  as case study, based on its interesting phenotypes to be studied further. we extracted dna from leaf tissues and about  <dig> million clean pe reads were obtained, corresponding to 108x coverage over the 380 mb m. truncatula genome. we used itis to detect te insertions in the genome and predict their zygosity based on allele frequencies . a total of  <dig> tnt <dig> insertions were identified in mutant line nf <dig> . among them, a total of  <dig> insertions  were identified into genic regions, including  <dig> in exons and  <dig> in introns . the preference for insertions in genic regions was statistically significant, comparing to  <dig>  simulated runs of random te insertions . this result is consistent with previous reports in m. truncatula, potato and soybean  <cit> , which showed that tnt <dig> insertion events preferentially occur in genic regions.  <dig> out of  <dig> insertions could be assigned to exact chromosomal positions. we further determined whether these insertion sites were in heterozygous or homozygous state. if a tnt <dig> insertion is in heterozygous state, the ratio of supportive pe reads  to background pe reads is 2: <dig> in theory. by the binomial test, we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> insertions were most likely homozygous .figure  <dig>

in order to evaluate how genome coverage affected the effectiveness of different programs, we randomly sampled pe reads from the sequence dataset generated from nf <dig> into subsamples representing 3x, 5x, 10x, 15x, 20x, 30x, 40x, … and 100x genome coverages and we examined the number of insertions that were identified using the four previously mentioned algorithms and itis. as shown in figure  <dig>  itis was the most effective at low genome coverage. most of the insertions could be identified with 25x genome coverage, where the number of insertions reached a plateau. tif, retroseq and relocate recovered less insertions than itis at all coverage levels. temp identified more insertions than itis at high coverage . however, the number of identified insertions continued increasing until 100x coverage and was not consistent with other algorithm results, suggesting that additional identified insertion sites identified by temp might be false positives. to validate our hypothesis, we selected three out of the  <dig> additional inserts uniquely identified by temp, for pcr validation. none of the three putative insertions were confirmed by pcr amplification, which suggests that most, if not all, of these additional insertions identified by temp were false positive insertions . to explain temp results, we inspected the  <dig> additional inserts uniquely identified by temp and found that all of them were located in repetitive regions, which might cause the unreliable temp identifications.figure  <dig>

comparing to the simulated dataset, itis required higher coverage to identify most of the insertions. it is most likely due to the fact that in the simulated dataset, reads were sampled from the reference genome , but in the nf <dig> dataset, reads were generated from a closely related genotype . even considering the difficulty of read alignment between the reference genome  and the pe reads from r <dig> due to genetic variations, itis showed better sensitivity and specificity than other algorithms.

validation of transposon insertions using database search and pcr-based approaches
to confirm itis identification in the mutant line nf <dig>  we first compared itis results with the tnt <dig> insertions identified and stored in the m. truncatula mutant database. in parallel, we confirmed the presence of tnt <dig> inserts identified by itis using a pcr-based approach.

a few years ago, a large effort has been initiated to identify the fst sequences present in the tnt <dig> insertional mutant population  <cit> . to date, a tremendous work has allowed the identification of more than  <dig>  high confidence  fst sequences from the  <dig>  tnt <dig> mutant lines using tail-pcr method. positions and sequences of these fst sequences have been stored in the m. truncatula mutant database  <cit> . this web server represents a powerful tool in reverse genetics to identify mutant lines for specific candidate genes. however, its potential is limited for forward genetics study because of partial recovery of fst sequences present in the database due to the large size of the population  and limitations of the high-throughput tail-pcr method used. in the m. truncatula mutant database,  <dig> tnt <dig> flanking sequences were identified in nf <dig>  however only  <dig> insertion sites were mapped in the genome. out of these  <dig> putative insert positions identified by tail-pcr, ten were also identified by itis . in order to validate insertions that were identified by itis, but not in the m. truncatula mutant database, we performed pcr-based validation of the presence and orientation of ten randomly selected putative insertions. we designed primers flanking the tnt <dig> insertion sites in order to test its presence or absence and primers on both sides of the tnt <dig> sequences  to determine its orientation . based on pcr results, both the presence and the orientation of all the different inserts tested were consistent with itis results . thus, in conclusion, the pcr-based approach validated itis results in term of presence, localization and orientation of inserts. in order to consolidate our experience, we sequenced a second m. truncatula tnt <dig> mutant line, nf <dig>  at around 40x genome coverage . using these short read data, itis predicted the presence, location, orientation and zygosity of six tnt <dig> insertions in nf <dig> . we performed pcr-based validation of five of them, and the presence, location, orientation and zygosity of all the inserts tested were consistent with itis results .

CONCLUSIONS
itis is a powerful bioinformatics tool suitable for identification of transposable elements for forward genetics. it may also serve as a valuable tool to identify phenotypic changes resulting from transposition events occurred at the species or sub-species level in evolutionary studies. it is suitable from low to high complexity genomes and performed well even using sequence dataset from genotypes that are closely related to the reference genome. by comparing with other similar algorithms, itis showed its superior or equal specificity, sensitivity and accuracy in a complex system. in conclusion, itis is a robust tool for identification of transposable elements in wide-ranging systems from cell to complex organisms such plant or mammal.
