BACKGROUND
pulmonary surfactant is a lipid-protein complex that is synthesized by type ii epithelial cells in the alveoli. surfactant is stored in intracellular organelles known as lamellar bodies and is secreted into airspace by exocytosis. surfactant lipids form monolayer and multilayer that line the alveolar surface, reducing surface tension created at the air-liquid interface. pulmonary surfactant is essential for the proper inflation and function of the lung  <cit> . surfactant deficiency is associated with premature birth, lung infection or injury. mutations in genes critical for surfactant production or function can cause lung atelectasis and respiratory failure  <cit> . surfactant homeostasis is maintained by a balance among multi-tiered processes, including the synthesis assembly, trafficking, storage, secretion recycling and degradation of surfactant proteins and lipids. while the structures and functions of pulmonary surfactant proteins and lipids have been extensively studied, little is known regarding the genetic and cellular mechanisms integrating the complex processes controlling surfactant lipid homeostasis.

transcriptional regulation of lipogenesis has been extensively studied in the liver and adipocytes. a number of tfs have been identified controlling the expression of lipogenic enzymes and genes in the lipogenic pathways including sterol regulatory element binding protein  isoforms, ccaat-enhancer binding protein  isoforms, nuclear hormone receptors  and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors   <cit> . srebp has two genes  encoding for three protein isoforms, srebp-1a, srebp-1c and srebp- <dig>  srebps are synthesized as inactive precursors and activated by proteolysis in the golgi apparatus. srebp- <dig> primarily activates cholesterol biosynthetic genes whereas srebp-1c predominantly activates genes involved in fatty acid production  <cit> . the c/ebps belong to the basic-leucine zipper class of tfs. six isoforms have been identified; all of which act as homo-or heterodimers via highly conserved bzip domain  <cit> . the involvement of c/ebps in lipogenesis is strongly supported by both in vitro and in vivo data. in adipocytes, c/ebpα, srebp-1c and pparγ induce fatty acid biosynthesis, but only c/ebpα is essential  <cit> .

lung maturation is highly dependent on the differentiation and function of the respiratory epithelium that, in turn, produces pulmonary surfactant lipids and proteins. studies from the conditional deletion or mutation of specific genes have lead to the identification of several tfs in lung epithelium that are crucial to lung maturation and respiratory adaptation, include ttf- <dig>  foxa <dig> and c/ebpα. ttf- <dig> binds to the promoters of lung specific genes such as sftpa, sftpb, sftpc, sftpd and scgb1a <dig> and increases their expression  <cit> . the deletion of foxa <dig> or cebpa from lung epithelial cells resulted in the lack of surfactant lipids and proteins, lack of appropriate differentiation of type i and ii cells and absence of lamellar body formation, indicating delayed peripheral lung maturation  <cit> . comparative microarray analysis show that although these tfs bind to distinct cis-elements in the promoter region of target genes, they are able to influence the expression of many common targets involved in surfactant proteins and lipid biosynthesis , fluid and solute transport  and innate host defense , suggesting that foxa <dig>  cebpα and titf <dig> may share common transcription network regulating perinatal lung maturation and postnatal adaptation  <cit> . the majority of information regarding the role of srebp has been focused to cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in tissues such as liver and adipose  <cit> . srebp-1c is expressed in the developing lung, where its expression increases during late gestation, concomitantly with the perinatal increases in surfactant lipid synthesis and the induction of genes critical for surfactant function  <cit> . srebp activates ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for phosphatidylcholine synthesis and increases surfactant phosphatidylcholine synthesis in the mouse lung  <cit> . these data strongly support the notion that in lung, srebp may play an important role in surfactant and phospholipid homeostasis.

a fundamental challenge in the "post genomic era" is to decode transcriptional networks that direct intricate patterns of gene expression in complex organisms. in the lung, how tfs interact with each other and signaling molecules to regulate groups of gene targets mediating distinct but integrated aspects of cell or organ function, and how lipid homeostasis is integrated with maturation of type ii epithelial cells remain unclear. it is highly likely that surfactant lipid homeostasis is controlled by complex interactions among transcriptional networks that integrate distinct but interrelated aspects of alveolar cell biology, e.g., lung maturation, host defense and surfactant function. several strategies have been devised to decipher regulatory components and networks, each is partially successful and none is without limitations. microarray analysis reveals mrnas that change significantly in expression, but fails to assign these changes to biological events. the go annotation and literature mining enable the association of genes with biological processes and pathways, but are limited to current knowledge. tf-tg correlation takes into account that expression profiles of tfs and their targets are often correlated and genes with highly correlated profiles are likely to be regulated by the same tf. in some instances, however, tfs regulate their targets, not by changing their own expression, but by post-transcriptional mechanisms such as transcript stability, binding site accessibility, interaction with tissue-specific co-factors or chromatin structures  <cit> . promoter analysis seeking conserved or common tfbss in promoters of co-expressed genes can identify the potential cis-elements, but may not inherently identify the binding tf or its role in transcription; moreover, this analysis is often associated with high numbers of false positive predictions due to the short and degenerate nature of many tfbs motifs. in the present study, we sought biological consistency and comprehensiveness by using a systems approach to integrate analytic results from independent and complementary resources, including gene expression profiling, protein interaction, functional annotation, promoter and literature mining, to develop a map of genetic networks regulating lung lipogenesis and surfactant homeostasis that are critical for lung function, focusing on the roles of key tfs in the network.

RESULTS
we retrieved microarray data from a lung specific gene expression database that measures lung mrna responses to genetic modification of various genes important to lung development and function . total of  <dig> mrna microarray samples from  <dig> distinct mouse models were used in this study .

cyclopamine_
clustering and functional classification revealed three lipid enriched gene clusters
cluster analysis grouped  <dig> genes that significantly changed in response to various gene perturbations into  <dig> clusters . genes in each cluster were further classified according to go classification by biological processes to test the biological relevance of each cluster. the criteria for an enriched functional class were p <  <dig>  in fisher exact test, the functional term being shared by more than 20% of the genes in the cluster. most clusters  had enriched functional classes according to the criteria, indicating their functional coherence within each cluster .

clusters listed in additional file  <dig> were subject to gene ontology analysis http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ to determine the extent of enrichment of biological function among genes in each cluster. clusters sharing biological functions were grouped together according to the function. shown in the table are enriched functional classes with enrichment p-value <  <dig>  and shared by more than 20% of the genes in the cluster.

in the present study, we sought to identify the transcription networks regulating perinatal surfactant lipid homeostasis. "lipid biosynthesis/metabolism/transport" was enriched in  <dig> out of  <dig> clusters and srebp was a member in three of the clusters. we chose to focus on three srebp related lipid clusters  for compactness and simplicity of the network .

in addition to the commonly enriched functions, i.e. "lipid biosynthesis and metabolism", each cluster has its uniquely enriched functionality . cluster  <dig> is functionally enriched in "lung" and "vascular" development, with corresponding mouse phenotypes that include "abnormal vascular development, alveolar morphology and respiratory mechanics". membrane/insoluble fraction is the most enriched cellular component in cluster  <dig>  cluster  <dig> is the smallest cluster among the three and is enriched for "lipid metabolism and lipid transport". mouse phenotypes associated with the cluster  <dig> include "abnormal respiratory alveolar morphology and abnormal lipid homeostasis". "endoplasmic reticulum " is the most enriched cellular component in this gene cluster. tissue distribution analysis indicated that the expression of genes in this cluster is most abundantly expressed in the lung. these functional annotations aligned well with the fact that surfactant lipid and proteins are synthesized and assembled in the er of alveolar type ii cells. cluster  <dig> is functionally enriched in "lipid metabolism" and "response to external/chemical stimulus", the corresponding mouse phenotype being "abnormal blood chemistry and alveolar morphology". overall, the functional classifications indicate that lung lipid metabolism is closely associated with lung development and is required for various stress responses.

genes from each cluster were subject to gene set enrichment analysis to identify enriched functions and processes, mouse phenotypes and cell components http://toppgene.cchmc.org/.

identification of commonly enriched tfbs
in general, transcriptional regulation is mediated by the binding of tf or their partners to specific binding sites  in the regulatory regions of the target genes . the tfbss are often located in close proximity to the transcription start site , but sometimes can be located at more remote locations  <cit> . it is assumed that functional tfbs are subject to greater selective pressure, and therefore will be evolutionarily conserved across species  <cit> . to identify over-represented tfbss in a given cluster, we took three approaches. first, we searched  <dig> kb upstream genomic sequence for tfbs in the evolutionarily conserved regions  that are over-represented in a gene cluster  <cit> . we then searched proximal promoter regions  for over-represented tfbs in the cluster  <cit> . we also determined the over-represented tfbs frequency in the proximal promoter region for each gene in the cluster. the relative importance of a tfbs was determined by the average ranking order of the ecr, promoter and frequency analysis. the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  tfbs for cebp , hnf3b  and srebp  are common to all three clusters, likely indicating the universal roles of these factors in lung lipid metabolism. tfbs for ttf <dig>  hnf <dig> , tcf <dig>  sox <dig> and barbie  were commonly enriched in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> genes. the enrichment of this group of tfbs in cluster  <dig> and  <dig> gene promoters may indicate their related roles in lung development and morphogenesis. in addition to commonly enriched tfbs among the clusters, we identified tfbs uniquely enriched for each cluster. for example, ciz , oct  and ets <dig> were unique to c <dig> genes; hnf <dig> and egr <dig> were unique to c <dig> genes; nfat and stat <dig> were unique to c <dig> genes. this was consistent with the finding that the three clusters have shared as well as unique functionalities.

determination of tf-tg functional similarity and expression correlation
it is assumed that genes share similar annotations are likely to be involved in similar biological processes. we used kappa statistics to quantitatively measure the degree of agreement how tf-tg sharing annotation terms  <cit> . kappa result ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  the higher the value of kappa, the stronger the agreement is. the annotation terms are downloaded from david knowledgebase http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/. we calculated the kappa similarity between the enriched tfs of a given cluster  and genes in the same cluster. table  <dig> lists top ranked genes according to their functional similarity  to that of srebf <dig> and cebpα.

correlation: the expression profile similarities between tf and genes in the same cluster were calculated using pearson correlation and ranked accordingly from high to low based on the correlation coefficient. the top  <dig> genes with the highest correlation with cebpa and srebf <dig> are listed in table  <dig> 

kappa similarity was calculated to estimate functional similarity between tf and genes based on the shared annotation terms. tf-tg functional association were ranked from high to low based on the kappa value. the top  <dig> genes sharing the highest functional annotations with cebpa and srebf <dig> are listed in table  <dig> 

we collected the positive tf-tg relationships from ingenuity knowledge base , transfac  <dig>  , eldorado  and pubmed. references for the known tf-tg relationships are listed in the table.

expression profiles of transcriptional regulators and their targets are correlated in many cases, and genes regulated by the same regulators are likely to be co-expressed  <cit> . we considered tfs in each cluster as potential regulators of the genes in the same cluster. we determined the tf-tg correlations using pearson correlation. srebf <dig> and cebpa expression profiles correlated well with many of the genes in the lipid clusters across various experimental conditions, there were  <dig> genes correlated with srebf <dig> and  <dig> genes correlated with cebpa with a correlation coefficient ≥ <dig> . table  <dig> lists genes whose mrna expression was strongly correlated with that of srebf <dig> and cebpα in the rank order of the pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. as indicated in the table  <dig>  regulation of a number of the top ranked genes by srebf <dig> and cebpα was experimentally confirmed through literature search, indicating tf-tg functional similarity and expression correlation can be useful features for tf-tg prediction.

tf-tg functional similarity measure is limited by known annotations for a given gene. likewise, correlation does not always hold true. for example, previous studies using lung selective deletion of foxa <dig> in the mouse demonstrated that foxa <dig> is critical for lung maturation and is involved in the expression regulation of genes in surfactant lipid synthesis  <cit> . the promoter and gene ontology analysis also indicate that foxa <dig> is an important regulator in the mouse lung lipid network. foxa <dig> mrna levels were poorly correlated with genes in the lipid clusters, there were only  <dig> genes that correlated with foxa <dig> with a correlation coefficient ≥ <dig> . we confirmed by qrt-pcr that foxa <dig> mrna expression levels do not substantially change during lung maturation . tfs can regulate their targets independently of their own levels of expression, for example by changing chromatin structure, histone-modification states, nucleosome positions in vivo, phosphorylation status, and binding site accessibility with other partners  <cit> . in other words, a positive correlation between tf and tg provides useful evidence for a regulatory relationship; a poor expression correlation does not necessarily indicate there is no relationship between a given tf-tg pair. our predication is based on the combined evidence from mrna expression correlation with promoter profiles and gene ontology similarity; the latter two methods do not require expression correlation.

prediction of gene regulatory interactions via data integration
we then predicted tf-tg interaction based on the integration of evidence from tf-tg correlations, promoter tfbs information, tf-tg kappa similarity and tf-tg interaction evidence. an integrative scoring function was developed to rank the possibility of tf-tg relationship, and to prioritize and associate each target with its potential regulators . based on these regulatory relationships, we constructed a lung lipid regulatory network. using the cut off confidence score of  <dig> , the overall connectivity of each tf was calculated and summarized in table  <dig>  hnf <dig>  etsf, srebp, cebp, gata and irff were the most common tfbss across the three lipid clusters with the highest connectivity in the network. using this method, we linked the tfs to their potential target genes in three lipid clusters in the order of confidence score . the tfbs of srebp, hnf <dig> and cebp are commonly enriched in all three lipid related clusters and share many downstream targets. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> listed top ranked potential targets for srebp, cebp and hnf <dig> according to the confidence score from the integrative analysis of three lipid related clusters. within the top  <dig> predicted targets for cebp, srebp and hnf <dig>   <dig> were common between srebp and cebp,  <dig> were common between cebp and hnf <dig>  and  <dig> were common between srebp and hnf3; suggesting complex crosstalk and interactions among cebp, srebp and hnf <dig> in the proposed lung lipid network.

we calculated the confidence score based on the integrative evidence of tf-tg relationship. using the cut off confidence score of  <dig> , the overall connectivity of each tf to its potential tgs within three clusters were calculated and summarized in table  <dig>  the corresponding tfs expressed in lung were also listed.

this method enables identification of genes of interest and their regulators in rank order of their confidence level . for example, abca <dig> is predicted to be regulated by tfs in the order of srebp <dig>  hnf <dig> , ttf <dig>  egr , e2f  and cebpa. abca <dig> is a known phosphatidylcholine transporter and plays an essential role in pulmonary surfactant lipid metabolism and lamellar body biogenesis  <cit> . abca <dig> mutations are associated with surfactant deficiency and fatal respiratory distress syndrome  <cit> . our previous studies showed that abca <dig> gene expression was regulated by srebp, cebpa and foxa <dig>  <cit> . abca <dig> promoter activity was regulated by both lung selective tfs including ttf <dig>  cebpa and foxa <dig> and the lipogenic tf srebp <dig>  the direct binding of srebp1c to abca <dig> promoter was confirmed by chip assay  <cit> . thus abca <dig> expression is regulated by both cis-acting cassettes, providing a mechanism by which surfactant and lipid homeostasis may be integrated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . in addition to known regulators, our model predicts egr and e2f as potential important regulators for abca <dig> expression. elovl <dig> encodes a microsomal enzyme involved in tissue-specific synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and sphingolipids  <cit> . little is known about elovl <dig> expression regulation other than that its mrna expression is correlated with srebp <dig> in brown adipocytes  <cit> . elovl <dig> was grouped in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  together with abca <dig> and our analysis predicts its control by srebp, cebp, hnf <dig>  ttf <dig> and tcf <dig>  sharing similar regulation with abca <dig>  slc34a <dig> encodes na/pi cotransporter 2b , is expressed most strongly in lung and only in apical membrane of alveolar type ii cells, the cells that produce and secrete surfactant. because of this localization, it was proposed that the function of the gene product is to take up phosphate from the alveolar fluid  <cit> . mutations in slc34a <dig> cause pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis  <cit> . we utilized transient transfection promoter assays and confirmed the activation of elovl <dig> and slc34a <dig> transcription by both srebp <dig> and cebpa . dlk <dig> encodes an egf like homeotic transmembrane protein that acts as a negative regulator of notch <dig> and adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . our analysis predicts its control by cebp, hnf <dig>  srebp <dig>  egr <dig>  hnf <dig> and gata <dig>  both elovl <dig> and dlk <dig> are highly enriched in alveolar type ii cells. based on the present model, we hypothesize that genes such as slc34a <dig>  dlk <dig> and elovl <dig> may share similar transcription regulation with abca <dig> in the lung where they are likely to influence surfactant metabolism.

gene
genes were selected based on their functional relevance to surfactant biosynthesis/transport. for each gene of interest, its potential tf regulators were predicted in rank order of tf-tg confidence score and tf-tg relationships were supported by promoter assay. top  <dig> tfbs and their corresponding tf in lung are listed under the selected genes.

construction of a lipid gene regulatory network in the mouse lung
a lung "lipid gene regulatory network" was generated by combining the predicted tf-tg relationships from the three clusters. in figure  <dig>  we show a sub-network consisting of the tfs with the highest connectivity  among three gene clusters. srebp, hnf <dig>  etsf, cebp, gata and irff are clear regulatory hubs in this network, these tfs are likely to be key regulators controlling surfactant lipid homeostasis in the lung via the regulation of genes within the three lipid-related clusters. the roles of several key tfs in the proposed network have been partially confirmed by previous studies from our group and others, including srebp <dig>  foxa <dig>  cebpa, etv <dig> and gata <dig>  <cit> . irf <dig> encodes interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  a member of the interferon regulatory transcription factor family. the finding that irf may serve as an important regulator in lung lipid homeostasis merits further experimental validation. the finding that previously experimentally validated transcriptional regulators of surfactant homeostasis were identified as key hubs in present unbiased network, strongly support the reliability of our proposed model.

due to the complexity and modularity of the biological networks, we have focused on several important sub-networks. figure  <dig> depicts the cebpa-srebp centered sub-network. 3a represents top ranked common gene targets for cebp and srebp and 3b represents top ranked unique gene targets for cebp and srebp. many known markers of lung maturation and function, including sftpb, abca <dig>  aqp <dig>  lpcat smad <dig>  etv <dig>  and vegfa are predicted to be co-regulated by srebp and cebpa. further studies are needed to understand how the proposed interactions between srebp and cebpa control lung maturation. a subset of predicted targets whose regulation was unknown previously was experimentally confirmed by in vitro promoter reporter assays .

experimental validation of predicted tf-tg relationships
network prediction was validated through promoter reporter assays, transgenic animal models and literature confirmation. since the integrative analysis predicted srebp, cebp and hnf <dig> as key regulators in the lipid related transcription network in lung, we focused on these three tfs to validate the network predictions derived from the bioinformatics analysis.

gene promoter assays were carried out on selective tf-tg pairs utilizing the following selection criteria: 1) confidence score, prioritizing top ranked gene targets of srebp and cebp, 2) tissue and cell specificity i.e. lung epithelial type ii cell enrichment and subcellular location in endoplasmic reticulum or golgi, 3) functional annotation that is lipid related and 4) originality, seeking novel targets with new function. applying these criteria, we selected the first set of candidate genes likely modulating lipid homeostasis in the lung epithelial cells, including elovl <dig>  slc34a <dig> and zdhhc <dig>  their functionality, expression and subcellular location as listed in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the promoter-reporter assays using c/ebpα and srebp1c cotransfected with ~ <dig> kb elovl <dig>  slc34a <dig> and zdhhc <dig> promoter-luciferase constructs in mouse lung epithelial cells  <cit> . consistent with our prediction , cebpa and srebp1c activated elovl <dig> and slc34a <dig> promoters; zdhhc <dig> was only regulated by srebp1c but not by cebpa. the functions of elovl <dig> and zdhhc <dig> in lung biology are unknown whereas scl34a <dig> has recently been linked to alveolar microlithiasis <cit> .

type ii cell expression information is obtained from pbge db. subcellular location is based on gene ontology http://amigo.geneontology.org/ db and genecard http://www.genecards.org/. protein function is based on uniprot knowledgebase http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/. disease information is based on the ingenuity knowledgebase  and genecard http://www.genecards.org/.

transgenic mice were used in conjunction with mrna microarray to identify genes and processes regulated by tfs and signaling molecules. the correlation between the genomic response of selective tf perturbation using transgenic mouse models and the integrative prediction derived from the present study provide in vivo evidence for the predicted tf-tg regulatory relationships. we compared predicted srebp, hnf <dig> and cebp targets with the genes differentially expressed in the lung after selective deletion of scap , foxa <dig> and cebpa from respiratory epithelial cells <cit> . these three arrays were not included in previously array analysis and network development, therefore can be used as independent data for validation. genes with high confidence score  were used as positive prediction, genes with low confidence score  were used as negative control. based on the binomial probability calculation, predicted gene targets showed significant overlap with genes responsive to the deletion of the respective tfs in vivo . within the top  <dig> ranked candidate targets for cebp ,  <dig> mrna were decreased in response to the cebpa deletion in the lung in vivo. likewise, within the top  <dig> ranked candidate targets for srebp ,  <dig> mrnas decreased in response to the scap deletion in vivo; and within the top  <dig> ranked candidate targets for hnf <dig> ,  <dig> mrnas were decreased in response to the foxa <dig> deletion . these results provide evidence that srebp, hnf <dig> and cebpa regulate the predicted gene targets expression in lung in vivo.

literature mining provides another resource to validate computational predictions for the enriched tfs and their potential target genes in the three lipid clusters identified in the present study. we used medscan reader, a natural language processing  text-mining tool  <cit>   to search the entire pubmed database. for each tf - tg pair, this algorithm extracts various types of regulatory mechanisms and the effects of regulation by recognizing different domain-specific named entities in the input text and extracting functional relationships among them. as indicated in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  all experimentally confirmed srebp targets were ranked in the top 5% of our predictions; all confirmed hnf <dig> targets were ranked in the top 10% of our predictions. in the case of cebpa, all of the experimentally confirmed cebpa targets were ranked within the top 30% of our prediction with the score > <dig> , 86% of them were ranked in the top 10% of our prediction. ccaat/enhancer binding proteins  include multiple family members that bind to cebp binding sites with different affinities; that may influence the precision of the present prediction.

taken together, the consistency of results from in vitro reporter assays, transgenic mice and literatures support the validity of the present approach and its potential utility for predicting important tf-tg relationships in the proposed transcription regulatory network.

biological implication of the lung lipid transcription networks
in the present study, we identified both general and context dependent regulators of lung lipid homeostasis related to pulmonary surfactant. the tfbs of srebp, hnf3b and cebp are commonly enriched in all three lipid related clusters and share many downstream targets. we hypothesize that srebp, cebp and hnf <dig> family of tfs form core regulatory modules to maintain surfactant production. consistent with our model, previous studies demonstrated that the deficiency of hepatic c/ebp in leptin-deficient mouse leads to impaired srebp signaling  <cit> , c/ebpα and srebp- <dig> form complexes in hepatocytes and synergistically regulate the transcription of lipogenesis associated genes such as acly and acss <dig>  <cit> . recent work from payne et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that srebp-1c is directly regulated by c/ebp factors during adipocyte differentiation  and c/ebpα plays a critical role in regulating srebp-1c in the later stages of adipogenesis . in the lung, c/ebpα and srebp-1c play important roles in alveolar type ii cells lipogenesis  <cit> . foxa <dig> interacts with c/ebpα in mouse liver  <cit> , foxa <dig> is necessary for normal expression of c/ebpα in embryonic mouse lung epithelial cells  <cit> .

core tfs may cooperate with other factors in a context dependent manner. in addition to "lipid metabolism", srebp is associated with target genes involved in other related biological processes in cooperation with other tfs. ttf- <dig>  plays a central role at various stages of lung development, essential for lung cell differentiation, maturation and proliferation, and for the production of surfactant proteins. ttf- <dig> binds to the promoters of lung specific genes such as sftpa, sftpb, sftpc, sftpd and scgb1a <dig> and increases their expression  <cit> . the effects of ttf- <dig> are likely mediated by its interactions with other tfs and co-activators, including wwtr <dig> , gata <dig>  <cit> , rar  <cit> , nfatc <dig>  <cit>  and nfi  <cit> . in the present study, ttf- <dig> is enriched in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  sharing many targets with srebp to control lipid and surfactant biosynthesis and transport , apoptosis , transcription regulation  and respiratory disease . among these, predicted targets such as cebpa, foxa <dig>  wwtr <dig>  jun, abca <dig>  sftpa and sftpb have been identified as interaction partners or transcriptional targets of ttf- <dig> <cit> ; targets like ahr, cebpa, id <dig> and dlk <dig> have the same relationships with srebp <cit> , but little information is available regarding combinatorial regulation of targets by multiple transcription factors.

egr is uniquely enriched in cluster  <dig> genes . egr- <dig> belongs to c2h2-type zinc-finger protein family and activates genes required for differentiation and mitogenesis. in lung, egr- <dig> plays a key role in the pathogenesis of il-13-induced inflammatory responses  <cit> . the role of egr- <dig> in lipid metabolism is unknown. present study identified a number of egr and srebp shared common targets that associated with lung disease or function , lipid metabolism , cell growth and proliferation . among these, scd <dig> and  <dig> are known target of srebf <dig>  <cit> , their mrna expression are also dependent on egr <dig>  <cit> . scd and fabp <dig> are known to play important roles in lung specific phospholipids/surfactant biosynthesis  <cit> . lpcat <dig> encodes lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylcholine in the remodeling pathway of phatidylcholine biosynthesis  <cit> . lpcat <dig> is highly expressed in lung type ii cells and plays a critical role in regulating surfactant phospholipid/surfactant biosynthesis  <cit> .

known disease associated genes were identified through the present network analysis. as predicted in figure  <dig>  abca <dig>  dlk <dig>  vegfa, ager, slc34a <dig> and surfactant proteins are co-regulated by srebp and cebpa. deficiency or mutation of surfactant proteins and abca <dig> cause interstitial lung disease and respiratory failure  <cit> , prdx <dig> is associated with allergic pulmonary eosinophilia and asthma  <cit> , dlk <dig> is associated with bronchiolo-alveolar adenocarcinoma and lung cancer  <cit> , vegfa  and kdr  play important roles in lung maturation  <cit>  and pulmonary hypertension  <cit> , ager  is associated with acute allergic pulmonary eosinophilia  <cit> , and mutations of slc34a <dig> cause pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis  <cit> . the finding that the present approach identified genes and processes associated with human lung disease indicates its potential utility for the discovery of new genes and biomarkers that may be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of lung disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
we employed a systems biology approach to begin mapping a transcriptional network regulating surfactant homeostasis in the lung. we identified novel and known tfs, signaling molecules and potential target genes within the network. srebp, cebp, hnf <dig>  ets, gata and irf were identified as regulatory hubs with high connectivity. we propose that srebp, hnf3b and cebp form a common core regulatory module mediating surfactant lipid homeostasis. these key tfs likely interact with other tf partners to regulate lung growth , differentiation and maturation , pulmonary host defense and inflammatory responses . the present study provides a systematic view and working model of a transcriptional network regulating the formation and metabolism of the pulmonary surfactant system.

the current approach also has several important limitations. the approach is unlikely to identify epigenetic, post-transcriptional and gene-environmental interactions that may play important roles in gene regulation  <cit> . likewise, we have not emphasized the study of enzymatic transport activities of the many enzymes and proteins identified in the network. all these will be important for our long-term understanding of lung lipid homeostasis, but are beyond the scope of the present study.
