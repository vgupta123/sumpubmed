BACKGROUND
the nuclear genomes of grass species vary widely in size due to polyploidization and amplification of repeat elements. on the smaller end of the size spectrum lies rice  whose ~ <dig> mb genome has been sequenced  <cit> . mid-sized genomes such as that of maize  present a far greater challenge for sequencing, while large genomes such as bread wheat  will require exceptional approaches. the great differences in genome size are mainly caused by differences in repetitive dna content, primarily ltr  retrotransposons that can comprise more than 50% of a nuclear genome. because the amplification of these sequences occurred in waves, assembly of contiguous sequence information without a physical map is difficult or impossible for genomes as large as the maize genome  <cit> .

despite these great variations in genome size, the gene content of these species appears to be about the same per  <dig> n genome  <cit> . therefore, a number of "gene-enriched" sequencing techniques have been proposed with the goal of sequencing primarily the genic regions, while excluding repetitive sequence as much as possible. the oldest of these is est sequencing, consisting of end reads from cdna clones. more recently, full length cdnas have been sequenced in rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , and a similar project is underway in maize  <cit> . these are by far the most gene-enriched techniques, albeit with some contamination from transcribed transposable elements  and other repeats  <cit> . in addition, these transcription-based techniques automatically eliminate transcriptional pseudogenes, a non-trivial undertaking when analyzing genomic sequence alone. however, est sequencing also has significant drawbacks, of which the most important is that it is strongly affected by transcriptional biases. some genes are expressed at high levels per cell or tissue, while others make only a handful of mrna molecules, and/or are active only in certain tissues or developmental phases. hence, est sequencing tends to miss some genes while sequencing others many times over, a costly redundancy. furthermore, sequencing of expressed products captures only exons and excludes all information about promoter regions, and paralogs may be easily conflated because intronic sequence data are missing.

to overcome these drawbacks, other techniques have been developed that work directly with nuclear dna. the most generic is high-cot sequencing , in which sheared dna is separated based on renaturation time. repetitive fragments renature faster, allowing them to be removed. this method has been applied in maize and resulted in 6-fold enrichment of genic sequences  <cit> . a second approach, referred to as methyl-filteration , makes use of the special properties of methylation in higher plant genomes. in these genomes, repetitive dna is generally found to be hypermethylated, while genic regions are hypomethylated, permitting enrichment by cloning into bacteria that do not tolerate some forms of cytosine methylated dna  <cit> . for the mf technique, dna is sheared from total genomic dna and is inserted into a plasmid vector, followed by transformation of the library into an escherichia coli host that will not tolerate clones containing methylated dna inserts; in maize this technique yielded gene enrichment comparable to the hc reads  <cit> . a third approach employed in maize makes use of the rescuemu transposable element  <cit> , relying on the fact that mutator elements preferentially insert into low-copy-number dna  <cit> .

a large dataset of hc, mf, and unfiltered  sequences has been produced and assembled to generate the assembled zea mays  contigs  <cit> . version  <dig> of these assemblies was constructed from  <dig>  mf,  <dig>  hc and  <dig>  unfiltered  reads. this dataset contains separate mf-only, hc-only and uf-only assemblies, which are henceforth referred to as the "mf", "hc", and "uf" datasets. the rescuemu assemblies  <cit> , henceforth referred to as "rm", are also available for comparison.

the mf and hc datasets were derived from small-insert clones, with mean length of  <dig> kb for hc clone inserts and < <dig>  kb for mf clone inserts. small inserts were essential for these techniques, since longer clones will often include repetitive elements along with genes and thereby be excluded; however, the small sizes limit the ability of the read pairs to link contigs into scaffolds. rescuemu-flanking sequences also do not link over a substantial distance, as the reads are adjacent to the insertion site. assembly of such reads leads to short contigs that result in a gapped alignment along a gene, especially because transposable elements may be present within introns  <cit>  and between core promoters and regulatory elements  <cit> . although comparison with est databases and sequenced clones indicates that almost every gene is represented in the assemblies, only about 30% were fully covered by the first ~ <dig>  mf and hc reads  <cit> . when these reads were compared to  <dig> random genomic regions of the maize genome, only 29% of the predicted genes were covered over more than 90% of their length  <cit> . furthermore, sequences assembled from these gene-enriched sets cannot be easily localized on a physical or genetic map.

to overcome these limitations, two complementary techniques have been proposed. both of these approaches generate paired end reads from longer clones, allowing them to link contigs generated by the previous methods. both techniques rely on methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to cleave nuclear dna preferentially in genic regions. for methylation-spanning linker libraries , dna was subjected to complete digestion by restriction enzymes such as sali or hpaii, and fragments of varying sizes  were cloned. the relatively long length of these clones allows them to span repetitive regions between genes, thereby linking the genes; it also allows their integration into a bac-based physical map based on dna fingerprints. hypomethylated partial restriction  libraries are similar but utilize only enzymes having 4-bp recognition sequences. partial digestion was employed, and fragments from 2– <dig> kb were selected for cloning and end-sequencing. the need for two unmethylated sites in close proximity ensures that these clones often sample low-copy-number sequences, and that they can also provide valuable information for linking contigs into scaffolds.

pilot studies  of  <dig> msll sequences  <cit>  and  <dig> hmpr sequences  <cit>  demonstrated enrichment of genes  equal to or greater than that seen with mf or hc, with hmpr producing the greatest retroelement depletion seen outside of est libraries. such pilot studies cannot indicate, however, when such approaches saturate  or how generally useful they can be across a genome that has been largely or fully sequenced.

although the dna composition and arrangement in most plant genomes is complex and only narrowly understood, the much greater epigenetic complexity of these genomes is even more mysterious. both msll and hmpr technologies provide full-genome capacity for the discovery of methylated blocks  <cit> . comprehensive analysis of a genome with msll and hmpr will uncover all of the blocks of dna that are completely methylated, perhaps in a tissue or at different times in development, and these can be studied to find unusual components like methylated genes or unmethylated transposable elements. as with any genomics technology, a comprehensive and high-throughput use of msll and hmpr can identify and highlight important components that deserve more detailed study.

the following study reports results of a comprehensive study of msll and hmpr sequences in maize. the observations from the pilot studies are confirmed and extended. it is shown that msll clones longer than  <dig> kb may be generated, and that msll clones of size  <dig> kb and higher can be accurately placed on a bac-based fpc map . the msll clones are found to be particularly valuable for identifying fully methylated dna blocks that could be discovered by no other technique, thereby allowing the identification of "genes" that are either annotation artifacts or exceptional in their epigenetic status. these valuable resources are made available to all scientists by providing their alignment to sequenced maize bacs as a web-based service  <cit> .

RESULTS
library production
the details of the production of the msll and hmpr libraries are summarized in table  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  hmpr clones of size 2– <dig> kb were produced and end-sequenced, yielding  <dig>  successful reads, with  <dig>   paired. the clones comprised  <dig> different libraries, built using one of two 4-bp specificity enzymes, hpaii or hpych <dig> iv, and different degrees of partial digestion. a total of  <dig>  msll clones were produced and end-sequenced, yielding  <dig>  successful reads, with  <dig>   paired. the clones comprised  <dig> different libraries, built using either hpaii  or sali , with insert sizes ranging from  <dig> kb to over  <dig> kb. one msll library used high-copy plasmid vectors with inserts of 7– <dig> kb, while the rest used bac vectors.

the sequences have been deposited in genbank with the following accession numbers: msll; cw003489– <dig>  cw010655– <dig>  dx824179–887735; hmpr; cl983298– <dig>  cw000001– <dig>  cw509394– <dig>  er990272–er <dig>  et000001–et <dig> 

the intent of the multiple libraries was to cover the maize genome thoroughly, as each library is expected to sample a somewhat different space. the msll clones were complete digests, so there should not be multiple clones of different lengths covering the same region, for libraries having the same cloning enzyme. the different sali and hpaii libraries should therefore be mutually exclusive, both in the genome regions they cover and  in their end reads. between the sali and hpaii library sets there will be overlap in the genomic regions covered, but the end-read sets are still expected to be disjoint, because the 4-bp recognition pattern of hpaii causes the cut site to be much closer, on average, to the starting point of the methylated region . because of this significant difference in the expected placement of the end reads, separate results are provided for msll-sal and msll-hpa.

in the case of hmpr, the size selection combined with the differing digestion levels  should ensure that each library samples regions with different average densities of cloning enzyme restriction sites  <cit> , and the two different restriction enzymes were used to target regions of maize with greater and lesser gc content . the presence of 5-methylation at any of the cytosines in these restriction sites will fully block digestion. considerable overlap was found between the hmpr read sets, and overall very similar properties were observed for the libraries, so the hmpr results are not usually reported separately by cloning enzyme.

the msll and hmpr reads were aligned to sequenced bacs to verify the size of the clones and to investigate the content of the internal sequence. a total of  <dig>  maize bacs were downloaded from genbank, of which  <dig>  had msll or hmpr alignments. of these bacs,  <dig> had ordered sequence contigs. the alignments were required to be paired, with stringent filtering applied to reduce false-positive alignments from the dataset . paired alignments were found for  <dig> hmpr clones and  <dig> msll clones, including representatives from all but two of the libraries. from the alignments, the clone lengths were estimated and found to be in accordance with expectations .

the repeat content of the bac sequences was characterized by masking them against the tigr v <dig>  repeat database . having done this, the bac alignments were used to estimate the repeat content of the whole msll and hmpr clones . for the hmpr clones, the percentage of masking was relatively low, from 18% to 36% with an average of 26%, while for msll libraries the percentage varied from 55% to 86% with an average of 65%.

organelle content of the sequences was also analyzed and used to develop an estimate of chimerism in the msll and hmpr clone libraries. organellar sequence was found in  <dig> % of msll clones and  <dig> % of hmpr clones. if chimerism is present in the libraries, some clones should exhibit organellar sequence on one end and genomic sequence on the other, with the ratio of single to paired organellar sequences providing a measure of the chimeric fraction. applying this test  led to an estimate of  <dig> % chimerism in the msll and  <dig> % in the hmpr .

by randomization of the data and sampling with replacement, the last  <dig> sequence reads were analyzed for new sequence discovery. hmpr yielded  <dig> unique sequences, while msll yielded  <dig> novel sequences in this last  <dig> after  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads were analyzed, respectively. both of these numbers are actually under-estimates of the true novelty of sequence discovery, because the same sequence found two or more times was often caused by different copies of the same repeat. hence, for msll, the true rate of novel sequence discovery may be 3-fold higher and as much as 25% higher for hmpr. even unadjusted, the level of novel sequence discovery for hmpr after this many clones are analyzed is exceptional, far exceeding rates of novel sequence discovery by est analysis, for instance  <cit> . these results also indicate that these two technologies were far from saturated at the current level of analysis in the maize genome.

since msll clones resulted from a complete digestion, they should uniquely cover their genomic region of origin. therefore, when comparing paired end reads from two clones, either both ends or neither end should match. to test this, the ratio of clone pairs matching on both ends to those matching on one or both ends was calculated . a total of  <dig> msll clone pairs matching on at least one end were identified, of which  <dig>  matched on both ends. the effect was relatively constant across the different msll libraries, with nine of the ten libraries having pairing fractions between 45% and 63%, and only one  being substantially different .

coverage of gene space
the end-sequences of hmpr and msll clones preferentially tag genes and therefore constitute another form of gene-enriched sequencing  <cit> . it is important to characterize the degree of the enrichment, and in what ways the gene space coverage of the various techniques are different. for example, if the msll sequences cover regions distinct from the mf and hc sequences, then their effectiveness as linkers will be reduced; conversely, if the hmpr cover unique regions, then they may be effective additions to a gene-rich sequencing strategy.

the hmpr, msll, mf, hc, uf, and rm sequences were compared to maize est contigs  <cit>  and the tigr maize repeat database  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  the msll-sal sequences were quite enriched for genic  sequences, while the hmpr were similar to the hc, mf, and rm sequences, and the msll-hpa were less enriched. hmpr sequences were also highly depleted in retroelement sequence , being slightly more depleted than the hc, and only the rm exhibited greater depletion.

 <dig> the mf, hc sequences are contigs of reads; all other types are direct reads.

known mite transposons are a quantitatively minor component of the maize genome, but were quite enriched in the msll and hmpr end-sequences compared to the uf control. msll-hpa reads were particularly rich in these predicted mites , while the msll-sal clones were rather less enriched .

to investigate the coverage of genic regions by hmpr and msll sequences,  <dig> annotated maize gene sequences were employed, each consisting of one gene along with introns and varying amounts of upstream  and downstream  intergenic sequence . a total of  <dig> hmpr sequences  and  <dig> msll  could be aligned to these genes . the positional distributions of the gene alignments are shown in figure  <dig>  which was created using a subset of  <dig> genes for which at least  <dig> kb of up- and downstream sequence was present in the annotated sequence set. each graph covers the  <dig> kb upstream, the gene interior, and the  <dig> kb downstream regions. this subset included  <dig> hmpr alignments to  <dig> different genes,  <dig> msll-hpa alignments to  <dig> different genes, and  <dig> msll-sal alignments to  <dig> different genes. both classes of msll alignments exhibit strongly bimodal distributions, with 5' and 3' peaks and a trough in the gene interior. the pattern was most pronounced for the msll-hpa inserts, for which the distribution was almost entirely concentrated in the 5' and 3' intergenic regions, while the msll-sal end reads extend into the gene itself. the hmpr alignments exhibited a more even distribution.

also interesting are the starting locations of the reads for the various sequence types. figure  <dig> shows the percentage of alignments for each type that begin in one of four different gene regions, either exons, introns, upstream dna, or downstream dna.  the msll-sal sequences were the most likely  to begin within an exon, and were the least likely  to begin within the 3' region. in contrast, the msll-hpa sequences were the most likely to begin in the 5' region , and were among the least likely to begin within either an exon  or an intron . hmpr reads were the second most likely to begin within an exon . the msll end reads were seen to be by far the most unevenly distributed class.

the msll sequences are expected to begin in unmethylated regions, and  to be fully methylated in the interior. given the association between repetitive elements and methylation, it is expected that repetitive elements should be less frequent near the start of these reads  as compared to the end of the reads . also, this effect is predicted to be most pronounced for the hpaii clones, whose ends lie closer to the epigenetic boundary. analysis of the repeat-masked reads bears this out: msll-hpa reads were  <dig>  times as likely to be masked in the last  <dig> bp compared to the first  <dig> bp, while msll-sal reads were 50% more likely, and uf control sequences were equally likely to be masked at either end. both varieties of msll clone were much more likely  to be masked within their interiors  than on their end reads .

linking of gene-rich contigs and placement on the fpc map
msll and hmpr sequences were aligned to the tigr azm v <dig>  contigs  as described in methods. in all,  <dig>   of the hmpr and  <dig>   of the msll reads could be aligned to  <dig>  azm contigs . links between two different azm contigs were made by  <dig> hmpr and  <dig> msll clones. as expected given their small size, a significant number of hmpr reads  had both ends within a single azm. the links were used to construct scaffolds of which  <dig> contained  <dig> azms,  <dig> contained  <dig> azms, and  <dig> contained > <dig> azms . the individual linking pairs were further checked, where possible, against the sequenced maize bacs, with 85% of  <dig> testable links being verified.

in order to place the scaffolds on a physical map, the msll clones were fingerprinted and integrated into the maize hicf fpc map  <cit> . a total of  <dig> clones were fingerprinted using the hicf methodology of  <cit> , where  <dig> were from 35– <dig> kb libraries ,  <dig> were from a 60– <dig> kb library , and  <dig> were from a > <dig> kb library . a total of  <dig> successful fingerprints were generated, of which  <dig>  were placed onto the map, in approximate agreement with the 83% estimated genome coverage achieved by the map  <cit> . of the  <dig> placed clones,  <dig> were in the 35– <dig> kb group, for a placement rate of 87%, which is significant as it demonstrates that clones that are much shorter than the original clones in the map  may be located on an hicf fpc map.

placements were checked for accuracy using the alignments to the sequenced bacs, as the location of the msll inserts on the fpc map should correspond to the location of the bac that it aligned to. of the 35– <dig> kb msll,  <dig> placements could be checked and  <dig> were verified, while  <dig> placements could be checked for the > <dig> kb range, and all were verified.

msll clone positions across the largest current contiguous assembly in maize
bruggmann and coworkers  <cit>  sequenced and assembled/annotated  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb regions on maize chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, from inbred b <dig>  when msll clone data were mapped across these regions, most msll bacs with paired end data were found to link genes that were separated by a large block annotated as mostly repetitive dna . this standard result indicates that all of these intervening repeats are 100% methylated at the restriction sites used for bac construction. in rarer cases , genes were annotated in the area between the msll bac ends. these may be exceptional genes that are 100% dna methylated for the bac construction enzyme sites, or more likely, are genome annotation errors. in the case shown in fig. 3b, three genes  are predicted to be inside a fully methylated region. although this could be caused by the methylation of these genes, it could also be a result of mis-identification of low-copy-number transposons as genes  <cit>  or assembly of the contigs into an inaccurate scaffold. in any of these three cases, the region is now identified as one that deserves further inspection. it should be noted that the epigenetic boundaries identified by msll clones need not always be between unmethylated genic regions and methylated regions full of transposable elements. in some cases, where genes are extensively or fully methylated, an epigenetic boundary can be fully genic and would be uncovered by msll or hmpr clones that indicate an absence of digestibility within that gene.

maize gene-searching and location web site
though all msll and hmpr sequences are available from genbank, their utility is greatly augmented for the public if they are available for search and location through a specialized web site. to this end, they have been made available online  <cit> . the location of the msll, hmpr, azms, est contigs and repeats along each bac is shown in the 'mini-bac' table , which provides an easy way to locate the gene-rich regions on the bacs. selecting a bac displays its details in the genome browser , and a versatile java display is also provided. the bac genome browser view also shows rm insertion sites, tigr repeats, and fgenesh predictions  <cit> . this site is updated with an automatic system that downloads new or modified bacs from genbank. additionally, a user-supplied sequence can be searched against any of the four types of sequences, with the alignment display linking in turn to the sequence and location on the bac.

discussion
this project was initiated for two reasons. first, to test the degree to which msll and hmpr technologies could enhance an efficient gene-enrichment approach to the characterization of large and complex genomes like those found in flowering plants and, second, to determine how efficiently epigenetic information could be added to a complex genomic sequence analysis. maize was chosen as the test organism because of the difficulty in assembling contiguous sequences from its  <dig>  gb genome  <cit> ; because a large database of mf and hc sequences exists for these species  <cit> ; and because many bac sequences have been and are currently being generated . in the process of characterizing the efficacy of msll and hmpr for aiding the finishing and linkage of shotgun sequences, the results provided additional insights into the structure and epigenetic status of the maize genome.

comprehensive coverage and possible artifacts in the hmpr or msll data
very few candidate chimerics were detected in the more than  <dig>  msll clones with paired end reads. only  <dig> clones exhibited an organellar dna sequence at one end and non-organellar dna at the other, and most of these were observed to be likely cases of organellar dna inserted into the nuclear genome . given the incomplete state of the maize genome sequence, it is quite possible that all of these apparent chimerics are actually cases of nuclear genomic regions with inserted organellar dna. apparent organellar chimerics in the hmpr data were even rarer, probably because organellar dna insertions into the nuclear genome are likely to be extensively cytosine methylated, and nearly all the candidates were found to be likely cases of organellar insertions in the nuclear genome.

among msll clones, which are the products of a complete digest, another possible indication of chimeric clones would be those that share the same sequence at one end but a different sequence at the other. among  <dig> apparently redundant msll clones, 44% were found to have the same sequence at both ends and 56% were found to have the same sequence at one end and a different sequence at the other. however, given the near-zero chimeric rate predicted by the organellar clones, it seems likely that most of this 56% must be caused by some other phenomenon than chimerism. using a newly identified low-copy-number database for maize  to scan these data, many of the clones with one different end sequence were found to be cases where the shared end sequence was in fact repetitive but not masked using existing repeat databases. hence, the "shared" ends were not truly shared, but were different copies of the same low-copy-number repeat, and these low-copy-number repeats appear commonly to be present in an unmethylated state. the partially-matching msll clones that would remain, if any, after a full masking by maize repeats, could indicate a lack of homogeneity in epigenetic status within the tissues sampled for dna preparation.

the number of clones needed for complete genome coverage is expected to vary widely across different msll and hmpr libraries. for instance, sali is predicted to have about  <dig>  sites in the maize genome, with about 16-fold more sites for hpaii or hpych <dig> iv, although the majority of these sites will be methylated. how sites are clustered, whether they are more or less abundant in the major repeats and several other issues can also affect the outcomes of msll and hmpr experiments. taking all of these issues into account, the major technical significance of this question is clear. moreover, it is also clear that the answers could only be provided when large-scale analyses were conducted like the one described herein.

because the number of gene islands is constant within a specific dna source , the actual number of msll-sal and msll-hpa clones needed to find all of these islands would be approximately the same . however, it would be predicted that deeper sequencing of larger size clones would be needed, on average, for msll-sal compared to msll-hpa. after  <dig>  msll bacs had generated paired end sequence data, >12% of the last  <dig> analyzed were still yielding unique linkages, compared to 33% in the  <dig> msll clones analyzed. hence, this technology was far from saturated, and analysis of another  <dig>  msll bacs would have been appropriate.

the hmpr libraries generated >43% unique sequences in the last  <dig> of  <dig>  generated reads . hence, the hmpr approach was far from saturation. if the maize genome is approximately 20% unmethylated and genic  <cit> , then this  <dig> mb is expected to have about 2– <dig> million digestible sites each for hpaii and hpych <dig> iv, so as many as a million reads from hmpr libraries would be appropriate to fully utilize this exceptional gene discovery technology on the maize genome. of course, any genes that are highly methylated in the tissues analyzed may not be enriched by hmpr technology, depending on methylated block size and the length of cloned fragments, but their ends might be uncovered by the msll approach, especially if small fragments are cloned.

maize genome structure and the distribution of dna methylation
the use of msll and hmpr libraries further confirmed, as previously observed by many laboratories, that most of the maize genome is highly cytosine 5-methylated at 5'-cg-3' and 5'-cng-3' residues, and that this dna modification is rarer in genes than in the ltr retrotransposons that make up the majority  of the maize genome  <cit> . this is illustrated both by the hmpr libraries, which have substantial enrichment for genic sequences coupled with a very low frequency of ltr retrotransposon sequences, and by the msll libraries, for which the incidence of retroelements increases greatly within the methylated interior region of the clone as compared to the end sequences, which are at least terminally unmethylated .

a significant fraction  of the dna inside the msll clones was found not to match known ltr retrotransposons or other abundant repeats . such non-repetitive, non-genic dna was noted previously  <cit> , and the present work extends this observation to show that much of this dna is also cytosine-methylated. the nature of this dna is unknown, but it is possible that it may be either currently unannotated ltr retrotransposons that are low in copy number, or degraded fragments of such elements  <cit> . in support of this interpretation, recent studies  have discovered dozens of new families of ltr retrotransposons that make up a good portion of the maize genome, but have low copy numbers  that have led to their current absence from any repeat-masking database.

the enrichment of mites in msll end sequences was expected because previous studies have shown that mites preferentially accumulate near genes, especially near the proposed insulator elements at the 5' ends of genes that are predicted to protect genes from spreading inactivation by surrounding heterochromatin  <cit> . the greater enrichment of mites within the end sequences of msll clones using hpaii as the generating enzyme was also expected since sali, a 6-bp recognition enzyme, should digest on average ~ <dig> kb from the epigenetic boundary, giving rise to an end read that would not often reach the boundary. this also explains the greater gene discovery potential of sali msll clones, because the recognizable coding exons of genes are usually several hundred bp to a few kb away from the epigenetic boundary where sali cuts.

the overall pattern of msll end read alignments to genes  was as expected, with 5' and 3' peaks and a central minimum reflecting the relationship of msll ends to epigenetic boundaries, and with both of these characteristics more pronounced for the hpaii clones relative to the sali clones. this indicates that a combination of sali and hpaii msll clones would be most effective in extending gene sequences to the epigenetic boundary and then linking them across methylated regions.

msll clones also provide a unique window into the dna methylation status of large stretches of the maize genome. because they are derived from complete digestions with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, the end sequences of a msll bac prove that the dna between those ends was completely methylated at all sites for that restriction enzyme in the tissue that was the source of the dna. such techniques as hybridization of immunoprecipated chromatin or dna  <cit>  and bisulfite sequencing  <cit>  are able to detect altered epigenetic states in a genomic region, but they are unable to easily or efficiently deal with specific repeats in highly repetitive regions. it would not be a major challenge to utilize the msll technique across tissue types to see if and when dna methylation patterns change across whole genomic regions during development or under some environmental conditions. in addition, when predicted genes are found inside a methylated block, this conflicts with the general observation that plant genes are unmethylated regardless of the tissue analyzed  <cit> . thus, these genes may be particularly interesting targets for the study of epigenetic regulation of genes  <cit>  and/or candidates that should be further investigated to see if they are actually artifacts of incorrect genome annotation  <cit> .

efficient genome sequencing with gene enrichment techniques
gene enrichment approaches to genome characterization are designed to provide the maximum amount of informative sequence in a short timeframe and at low cost. ideally the sequence set would include  the sequences of all genes  and  the locations of all genes on physical and genetic maps. the highly complementary hc and mf approaches have been proven to tag most maize genes with very high efficiency at least with one read  <cit> . however, comparison of hc and mf data to  <dig> random regions of the maize genome indicates an under-representation of sequences flanking the coding region that contain regulatory elements  <cit> . the results herein show that msll reads, particular from the hpaii libraries, drive sequencing into the 5' and 3' flanking regions . in addition, both hmpr and msll clones were successful in linking azm contigs into larger scaffolds, even at the low coverage attained in this project. this is essential for spanning whole gene regions, given that regulatory and coding sequences may be separated by the insertion of ltr retrotransposons, and that introns may also be enlarged due to the presence of repetitive elements  <cit> .

the results also show that msll clones, uniquely among gene-enriched sequence types, can be fingerprinted and placed on the physical map by the now-routine hicf technology. since their end sequences will often overlap azms, dna markers used for genetic mapping, and other gene-rich sequence assemblies, they can provide indispensable linking of gene-rich contigs onto both physical and genetic maps.

CONCLUSIONS
msll and hmpr technologies generate uniquely interesting sets of gene-rich sequences, offering significant benefits as part of an overall genome sequencing strategy. in particular, msll sequences access the dna upstream and downstream of genes that are under-represented in other gene-enrichment survey sets. each technique also generates paired reads, enhancing the assembly and linking of all gene-rich regions, and allowing the resulting contigs to be located on an fpc map.

because the b <dig> cultivar of maize is now being fully sequenced using a bac-by-bac strategy  <cit> , low-cost sequencing in this cultivar is no longer an urgent need, and none of the gene-rich sequencing strategies have been carried fully to completion. however, the gene-rich strategies can play a major role for other cultivars of maize and for the larger genomes  that are found in the majority of flowering plants. until such a project is attempted at a scale that tests the final steps in complete gene discovery and sequence analysis, the degree to which these tools can be applied across plant genomics will remain somewhat unclear.

even in the context of bac-by-bac maize sequencing, the msll and hmpr sequences can play a valuable role in improving and correcting the assemblies, due to their use of paired reads, and their tendency to span highly repetitive and difficult-to-assemble genomic regions. furthermore, placement of unmethylated sites and methylated blocks onto the genomic sequence provides an additional epigenetic level of genome annotation, indicating candidate sites for further analysis of the accuracy of gene discovery and for further study of poorly understood gene regulatory functions. a full display of msll/hmpr alignments to maize bacs, as well as alignments of other gene-rich sequences and repeat-database annotation, is provided at the arizona genomics computational lab  <cit> . the hc, mf, hmpr and msll clones can be ordered from the arizona genomics institute  <cit> .
