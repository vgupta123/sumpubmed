BACKGROUND
peroxisomes are ubiquitous intracellular organelles that originate from the endoplasmatic reticulum  <cit> . various biosynthesis and metabolic pathways including β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, α-oxidation of branched and straight chain fatty acids  <cit> , plasmalogen synthesis  <cit> , and hydrogen peroxide detoxification  <cit>  are located in peroxisomes. unlike mitochondria, peroxisomes lack the ability to synthesize dna and proteins. therefore, all peroxisomal proteins must be imported. more than  <dig> proteins, predominantly enzymes and peroxisomal membrane proteins are known to be sorted from the cytoplasm or endoplasmatic reticulum to peroxisomes. apart from a peroxisomal membrane protein specific targeting signal   <cit>  two types of peroxisome targeting signals, pts <dig> and pts <dig>  mediate the peroxisomal import of proteins by peroxisome biogenesis factors  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the majority of peroxisome-targeted proteins contain pts <dig>  a c-terminally located trimer -- signal that has been refined and extended to a dodecamer motif  <cit> . less than ten peroxisomal proteins are targeted via the n-terminally located pts <dig> signal --x-x---x--  <cit> . one of the pts2-targeted proteins phytanoyl-coa hydroxylase is deficient in refsum disease and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type  <dig>  these and other inherited peroxisomal disorders caused by deficiencies in pex proteins and ten other peroxisomal enzymes  <cit>  have significantly contributed to the understanding of metabolic pathways in peroxisomes. however, several regulatory mechanisms including intra-peroxisomal processing of imported enzymes and their degradation, glycophospholipid metabolism, or oxidative stress defense in mammalian peroxisomes cannot be fully explained with the known set of peroxisomal proteins. in addition, the peroxisomal localization of pts1-containing viral proteins  <cit>  and piggy-back type targeting  <cit>  imply that cellular proteins with and without pts and hitherto unknown peroxisomal location maybe sorted to peroxisomes under certain conditions  <cit> .

attempts to identify the peroxisomal proteome from subcellular fractions of rat livers using mass spectrometry  <cit>  led to the discovery of new peroxisomal proteins but also missed a number of known peroxisomal proteins  <cit> . alternatively, new peroxisome-targeted proteins can be predicted computationally. for example pts1prowler is predicting whether a protein with c-terminal pts <dig> sequence is targeted to peroxisome  <cit> . yet, the performance of subcellular location predictions, for example psort ii  <cit> , ptarget  <cit>  or pts <dig> predictor  <cit>  is limited by the small number of peroxisomal training data compared to the data on nuclear, mitochondrial and cytoplasm-located proteins. even the predictions for known peroxisomal proteins by different programs may not show agreement in terms of subcellular location.

we therefore developed a computational pts <dig> screening method combined with manual annotation steps to identify new peroxisome candidates from protein coding sequences of genbank®  <cit> . the effort led to the identification of tysnd <dig>  a peroxisomal protease that processes pts <dig> and pts2-targeted enzymes involved in β-oxidation  <cit> . encouraged by this finding we decided to apply a similar approach for identifying new pts2-targeted proteins, while improving the first-pass experimental confirmation of remaining pts <dig> and new pts <dig> candidates. unlike the pts <dig> screening, regular expression and hidden markov model  profile searches were used to extract pts2-containing candidates from genbank®. for rapid confirmation of peroxisomal protein candidates by confocal laser scanning microscopy we established the cell line cho-perred that stably expresses a peroxisome-targeted red fluorescence reporter.

preempting the results, none of the experimentally tested pts <dig> candidates localized to peroxisomes. zinc binding alcohol dehydrogenase zadh <dig>  one of two tested pts <dig> candidates, was confirmed and preliminary characterized. yet, the non-peroxisomal location of pts <dig> candidates raised interesting questions about differential targeting and the future of subcellular targeting predictions, including their validation.

methods
regular expression search
putative translation of non-truncated coding sequences  of more than  <dig> amino acids length were retrieved from mrna entries of genbank®  primate , rodent  and high-throughput cdna  divisions. the extracted  <dig>  cds were screened with the emboss suite program  <cit>  fuzzpro for the presence of the modified pts <dig> signal --{p}-x-x---x--. proline was excluded at position three of the original pts <dig> regular expression  <cit>  because it can prevent targeting. mismatches were not allowed and the search space was limited to the first  <dig> amino acids.

hmm profile search
a hmm profile is a position-specific scoring model derived from a multiple sequence alignment. the pts <dig> hmm profile was created from known functional pts <dig> signals of peroxisome-targeted proteins  using hmmbuild  <cit> . the calibrated hmm profile was used to search the cds set sequences, containing the first  <dig> amino acids, with hmmer.

filtering and annotation of candidates
both regular expression and hmm profile searches will yield sequences matches that are redundant, associated with known pts2-targeted proteins, or with candidates that are unlikely to be localized to peroxisomes. to eliminate these sequences we applied a triage supported by manual curation, similar to the filtering procedure described by kurochkin et al.  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> known pts <dig> containing sequences  were eliminated from both regular expression  and hmmer search  results. information on protein family classification and functional domains of the protein candidates were extracted from interpro  by using interproscan . blastp  searches against non-redundant genbank® cds translations were used to establish biological informative names for sequences without descriptions. sequences that contained only motifs incompatible with peroxisomal localization ), or that were supported by an unequivocal psort ii  <cit>  nuclear localization were eliminated. in addition, we predicted protein solubility and the numbers of trans-membrane spanning regions using the programs sosui  <cit>  and tmap  <cit> . only sequences that resulted in "soluble" predictions and no more than one trans-membrane spanning region were considered.

cell culture and transfection
cho-k <dig> chinese hamster ovary cells  were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  containing  <dig>  mm non-essential amino acid  and 10%  fetal bovine serum  at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig>  one day before transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown for one day in  <dig> ml medium without antibiotics. at 90–95% confluence the cells were transfected using lipofectamine  <dig>  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the plasmid dna was diluted in opti-mem i reduced serum medium . four to six hours after transfection the medium was replaced with fresh antibiotic-free growth medium.

selection of stable cell line
cho-k <dig> cells were transfected with pdsred2-peroxi , encoding the peroxisome-targeted dsred <dig> reporter protein . stably transfected cho-k <dig> cells were selected with g418-supplemented medium  at a final concentration of  <dig> mg/ml. after two weeks of g <dig> selection, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates and monitored by fluorescence microscopy. wells containing only red fluorescent cells were chosen for subculturing . the stable cell line cho-perred was maintained in the  <dig> mg/ml g418-containing medium to avoid the loss of the transfected dna. after a maximum of five passages cells were frozen.

localization of novel peroxisomal candidates using confocal microscopy
cho-k <dig> or cho-perred cells were plated onto glass cover slips. cho-perred cells were transfected with expression vectors pcdna <dig> /nt-gfp-zadh2-topo, pcdna <dig> /nt-gfp-kbtbd10-topo, pcdna <dig> /ct-galk2-gfp-topo, pcdna <dig> /ct-qpctl-gfp-topo, pcdna <dig> /ct-fut8-gfp-topo, pcdna <dig> /ct-sytl3-gfp-topo, pcdna <dig> /ct-ppp3ca-gfp-topo and pcdna <dig> /ct-acaa1-gfp-topo . the pts <dig> candidates  and known pts2-located thiolase  were expressed as fusion proteins with gfp at the c-terminus. the pts <dig> candidates kbtbd <dig> and zadh <dig> was expressed as n-terminal gfp fusion proteins. live-cell microscopy using the 63× objective of the laser scanning confocal microscope tcs sp <dig>  was performed  <dig> h after transfection of the gfp fusion protein constructs. the laser spectra  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm were used for observation of gfp and dsred <dig>  respectively.

these experiments were performed as previously described by kurochkin et al.  <cit> . details are given in additional file  <dig> 

RESULTS
peroxisomal protein candidates
the prediction of pts2-targeted proteins from translated cds of genbank® rodent and primate mrna sequences using regular expression yielded  <dig> matches whereas the hmm profile search  <cit>  produced  <dig> hits . of  <dig> total matches  <dig>  were detected by both methods. seventy-two  matches were unique to hmmer and  <dig>  matches to the regular expression searches. the results reflect the difference of prosite-type matching of all possible pts <dig> variants, and pfam-style position-specific scoring that corrects for unequal representation of pts <dig> residues. thirty-six sequences that were identified by both methods corresponded to known pts2-targeted proteins encoded by six mouse genes and their eleven orthologs in human, rat, and/or guinea pig .

after visual inspection of  <dig> new candidates, supported by results of blastp and interpro motif searches as well as predictions of transmembrane-spanning regions and psort ii subcellular localization, we excluded  <dig> sequences that were either redundant or contained unambiguous features, deemed incompatible with peroxisomal functions . of the remaining  <dig> candidates, representing  <dig> mouse genes, eight human and five rat orthologs, twelve sequences showed a conserved pts <dig> signal in all three species . eight candidates carried a conserved pts <dig> signal in mouse and human . two mouse pts <dig> candidates, e330021d16rik and 6030452d12rik, lacked mammalian orthologs. four candidates  had human orthologs, but without pts <dig>  details of the detection method, pts <dig> signal and selection criteria for experimental testing of the  <dig> mouse candidates are shown in table 1a and additional file  <dig>  five candidates  containing conserved pts <dig> were chosen for co-localization studies. in addition, we included the pts <dig> candidates  sarcosin  and zadh <dig> in the experimental evaluation. both candidates were predicted in an earlier study  <cit> , but have not been evaluated by us.

establishment of stably transfected cell line for peroxisomal co-localization studies
a commonly used method to support computationally predicted subcellular localizations is testing cells for co-localization of the transiently transfected gfp-tagged candidate and a fluorescent marker. variation in the copy number of integrated plasmids expressing the marker protein in transiently transfected cells, and time-consuming optimization of the ratio between gfp-fused candidate and the marker dna for each experiment render this method unsuitable for systematic testing of larger number of candidates with minimum variation in experimental conditions. since cho-k <dig> cells are widely used in co-localization experiments of peroxisomal proteins, we stably transfected the peroxisomal marker dsred2-pts <dig> into cho-k <dig> cells to establish the cell line cho-perred .

the morphology of cho-perred cells was comparable that of cho-k <dig>  dsred <dig> was uniformly expressed in almost all cells . after five passages the expression of dsred <dig> has not changed . co-localization of known peroxisomal proteins with dsred <dig> was tested by transfecting cho-perred cells with gfp-fused acca <dig> , which is targeted by pts <dig>  confocal microscopy confirmed the overlapping punctuate distribution of acaa <dig> and dsred <dig>  that is characteristic for peroxisomal localization.

peroxisomal localization of pts1-containing candidate zadh <dig> in cho-perred cells
mouse zadh <dig> co-localized with dsred in cho-perred cells . the peroxisomal localization of zadh <dig> was corroborated by the findings of islinger et al.  <cit> . the authors identified zadh <dig> in liver peroxisome subfractions of bezafibrate-treated rats using mass spectrometry. the peroxisomal localization of zadh <dig> was demonstrated in a stably gfp-pts <dig> transfected cho cell clone. however, the function of this new peroxisomal enzyme was not further characterized.

since computational inferred evidence from sequence analysis suggested alcoholdeydrogenase and antioxidant functions, rather than direct involvement in β-oxidation we tested whether zadh <dig> is inducible by bezafibrate or high fat diet. bezafibrate is a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha  agonist that increases liver β-oxidation of fatty acids. zadh <dig> expression upon bezafibrate treatment was slightly reduced  compared to normal-diet controls , indicating a non-pparα related activation mechanism. in accordance with previously published data  <cit> , bezafibrate significantly induced thiolase expression  whereas scp <dig> expression remained unchanged. on the other hand, high fat diet induced zadh <dig> expression  while the expression β-oxidation enzyme thiolase remained more or less at control levels. considering that the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase is not affected by bezafibrate  <cit> , zadh <dig> may indeed assume protective functions against peroxisomal peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. whether zadh <dig> is a functional homolog of the cytosolic nadp-dependent quinone oxidoreductase  <cit> , which also belongs to the superfamily of zn-containing alcohol dehydrogenase remains to be established in future studies.

non-peroxisomal localization of pts2- and pts1-containing candidates in cho-perred cells
the predicted subcellular locations of one pts <dig> and five pts <dig> candidates did not conform to the observed localization in cho-perred cells . kbtbd <dig>  galk <dig>  sytl <dig> and qcptl were detected in the cytoplasm. fut <dig> localized to spotted structures in the cytoplasm within proximity of the nucleus. considering that fut <dig> was initially isolated from golgi-rich fractions of rat liver  <cit>  the observed localization is believed to be the golgi apparatus. ppp3ca was detected in aggregated structures in the cytoplasm with negligible punctuate localization to peroxisomes. the aggregates were reminiscent of the calcineurin clusters in cos <dig> cells  <cit> .

from a computational point of view the five pts <dig> candidates were false positives. typically, the result would be indicative of poor accuracy of the initial pts searches and/or problems in the candidate selection strategy. the initial pts <dig> regular expression search used an improved motif --{p}-x---x-- that is much more restrictive than the original pts <dig> motif --x-x-x-x-x--  <cit> . similarly, when building the hmm model we excluded a. thaliana at1g <dig> , to obtain a tighter model. consequently, the number of hits for both regular expression  and hmmer  without redundancy reduction was relative low and included  <dig> known pts <dig> sequences.

the selection strategy was based on the knowledge of peroxisome biology at the time the study was planned. since the intermingling of computational search with semi-manual candidate filtering and manual prioritization  for experimental validation does not allow standard performance comparisons with other methods, we only used the sequences of the selected candidates, known pts sequences and actual subcellular locations for comparisons. a complete assessment of the selection strategy would require not only the replication of all steps for the initial prediction results of other methods, but also the comparison of different semi-manual filtering steps, and the prioritization step by independent biologists. despite the partial nature of comparisons with other methods, the emerging discrepancies and limitations of peroxisome targeting prediction approaches, including ours, may be used to re-evaluate and improve peroxisome targeting prediction strategies, particularly for pts <dig> 

comparison of subcellular locations with predictions by pts <dig> predictor
pts <dig> target signal predictor of peroxisomedb  <cit> , which uses blimps position-specific scoring matrix search  <cit> , detected putative pts <dig> in all candidates at the same positions as hmmer, albeit different e-values . the e-values  of potential pts <dig> in ppp3ca, ppp3cb, zmiz <dig>  armc <dig>  and wdr <dig> sequences were one to two magnitudes lower than hmmer e-values . assessment of the predictions with published, experimentally determined subcellular locations showed that none of the proteins were reported to locate to peroxisomes . on the other hand, the pts <dig> target signal predictor e-values of galk  and qpctl  and fut <dig>  were above the cut-off threshold of  <dig> . although the comparison with pts <dig> targeting predictor was restricted to our candidate set, both prediction methods do not appear to be very effective.

comparison of pts <dig> predictions with locate subcellular location summaries
comparison of the predicted peroxisomal location with available subcellular location summaries of locate database  <cit>  showed no concordance . the locate subcellular location summary is based on evidence from primary literature, original experiments, and annotations derived from various databases , if available. all known pts2-targeted mouse proteins, except acaa1b, and four out of ten pts <dig> candidates had a locate summary. the summaries of fut <dig>  ppp3ca, ppp3cb and zmiz <dig> displayed non-peroxisomal locations, which are in line with our experimental results  or literature evidence .

variation of predicted subcellular locations across different prediction tools
locate entries are also linked to integrated results of computationally more sophisticated subcellular location prediction methods cello, ptarget, proteome analyst, wolfpsort, and multiloc. when comparing the predicted subcellular locations of entries corresponding to six known pts <dig> targeted proteins as well as our candidates, we noticed little agreement in the output of each prediction method . in fairness to the five methods, it should be noted that they were not specifically designed to predict peroxisomal locations. a performance comparison by sprenger et al.  <cit>  demonstrated an overall good performance for frequently represented locations e.g., nuclear, cytoplasmic, extracellular and mitochondrial. cello, multiloc and wolf psort showed reduced sensitivity for under-represented locations, such as peroxisomes.

interestingly, ptarget  <cit>  and cello  <cit>  predicted five of six sequences of known mammalian pts <dig> targeted proteins correctly. wolfpsort  <cit>  predicted pex11c, phyh, acaa <dig> and acaa1b as mitochondrial, apgt as cytoplasmic and mvk as extracelluar. proteome analyst  <cit>  reported two peroxisomal , one cytoplasmic , two mitochondrial  and one unassigned locations . multiloc  <cit>  is not trained to recognize pts <dig>  the predictions of the pts2-containing but non-peroxisomal located proteins coincided with experimentally reported locations for galk <dig>  wdr <dig>  ppp3ca and pgm <dig>  but varied for the other tested sequences.

similarly, the recently identified pts1-targeted tynsd <dig>  zadh <dig> of this study and three candidates, kbtbd <dig>  gab <dig> and scarb <dig>  were predicted by all five programs to locate to various non-peroxisomal locations. locate subcellular location summaries were not available for these proteins.

when using the dedicated pts <dig> prediction methods of pts1prowler  <cit>  and pts1predictor  <cit>  the concurrence of results with experimentally determined locations improved, particularly for pts1prowler. details are shown in additional file 8b. tysnd <dig> and zadh <dig> were correctly predicted as pts <dig> targeted with scores of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. since pts1prowler is an add-on to the general subcellular location predictor pprowler  <cit> , prediction results indicated also a possible mitochondrial location for tysnd <dig> . zadh <dig> was given a score , almost equal to the peroxisomal location score , for an unspecified other subcellular location. these predictions contrast independent experimental results.

pts1predictor predicted all five proteins as peroxisome-targeted, but with varying scores and false positive probabilities . the peroxisome-targeted tysnd <dig> received the highest score  and lowest false positive probability followed by gab <dig> , scrab  and kbtbd <dig>  which are actually non-peroxisomal. the peroxisomal zadh <dig> had the lowest score .

another three pts <dig> prediction tools are peroxip  <cit>  and peroxisomedb pts <dig> target signal predictor  <cit> . peroxip could not be evaluated due to web server problems at the time of preparing the manuscript. the target signal predictor for pts <dig> is using a twelve amino acid pts <dig> position-specific scoring matrix for the blimps search  <cit> . since the blimps search output provides hits over the entire sequence length rather than the c-terminus were pts <dig> resides, the results require manual inspection by the user.

concept of oscillating pts
the unsatisfactory outcome of the predictions suggests that sequence-based features and evolutionary conservation, even in combination with manual annotation and human-inferred supporting associations  are insufficient for predicting the correct subcellular location, particularly for pts2-containing candidates. similar observations were made by neuberger et al.  <cit>  for  <dig> vertebrate lysozyme sequences containing a computational bona fide pts <dig> sequence that causes pts1predictor  <cit>  to classify them as peroxisome-targeted candidates. in fact, lysozymes are secreted proteins. when the n-terminal signal peptide was replaced by a gfp tag, lysozyme was targeted to peroxisomes. since pts <dig> became functional upon replacement of the signal for secretion it was dubbed a "silent pts", rather than a false positive  <cit> . we believe that the existing disagreement about the cytosolic and peroxisomal locations of the gmph kinase family members mevalonate kinase  <cit>  and phosphomevalonate kinase  <cit>  might be rooted in ptss that oscillate from "silent" to "functional", depending on their surface accessibility. the localization of the third gmph kinase family member galk <dig> in this study may underlie the same mechanism.

the recently characterized peroxisomal matrix protein, human soluble epoxide hydrolase  lends support to our hypothesis. ephx <dig> contains a rare pts <dig> signal  and two pts <dig> signals  <cit> . it locates to the cytoplasm or peroxisome depending on the surface accessibility of pts <dig> and protein expression level. the two pts <dig> signals are non-functional due to surface inaccessibility. in vivo data showed that the pts <dig> signal poorly mediated peroxisomal targeting if the ephx <dig> protein expression level was low. according to the authors, 90% of ephx <dig> of was found in the cytoplasm. on the other hand, increase of epxh <dig> pts <dig> surface accessibility led to peroxisomal import that was independent of the protein expression level.

the concept of oscillating pts should not be misunderstood as excuse for the poor performance of pts <dig> predictions. instead, it highlights the need to build pts <dig> and pts <dig> predictors that can simulate the selection criteria of pex <dig> and pex <dig> receptors. the comparison of free energy differences of pts <dig> peptide pex <dig> receptor binding showed mediocre correlation  with the pts1predictor scoring results  <cit> . improvements in predicting pts <dig> targeting are expected to come from the integration of pts <dig> accessibility information gleaned from three-dimensional structures of pts2-containing proteins and quantitative measurements of pts <dig> peptide affinities to pex <dig>  improved prediction indicators may not entirely solve the problem of differential subcellular sorting and interactions with cytosolic proteins or even other organelles.

differential subcellular sorting and context dependency
for two peroxisomal enzymes, mammalian alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase   <cit>  and yeast catalase a   <cit>  differential targeting has been associated with changes in dietary or nutrient conditions. agt has a n-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal  and a c-terminal pts <dig>  the dual-targeting capacity of agt to locate preferentially to the peroxisomes  or mitochondria  is likely correlated with the shifting diet in the evolution of carnivors  <cit> . in case of human agt pts <dig> targeting is further complicated by the dependency on an ancillary  <dig> amino acid peroxisomal signal  <cit> . analyses of agt substitution ratios in the mts of primates  <cit>  and carnivora  <cit>  indicated that positive selection pressure by an increase of herbivorous diet component in primates affected the n-terminal mts and use of two neighbouring in-frame translation initiation sites. the outcome is seen in a decreased or abolished mitochondrial targeting capacity.

indeed, statistical analysis of across  <dig> mammalian species demonstrated that the localization significantly correlated with diet rather than phylogeny  <cit> . for example, in human, rabbit, and guinea pig agt localises to the peroxisomes, whereas in dog and cat, agt is predominantly mitochondrial. in rat, agt localises to both, peroxisomes and mitochondria. subcellular localisation testing of peroxisom-targeted enzymes over a wider range of species may reveal more cases of diet context-dependent differences in targeting.

even more striking is the nutrient-dependent differential targeting of cta <dig> in yeast  <cit> . cta <dig>  which has both pts <dig> and pts <dig> signals but no mitochondrial targeting signal, localizes almost exclusively to the mitochondria when grown on raffinose under respiratory conditions. if the yeast is grown on oleate or on glucose under fermentation conditions, cta <dig> is targeted to both peroxisomes and mitochondria. details of the molecular mechanism and regulatory network are not known.

at last, the discovery of mitochondria-derived vesicles   <cit>  added yet another twist to the prediction of subcellular protein locations. mdvs were shown to transport various mitochondrial proteins to peroxisomes where they fuse with a subset, estimated to make up around 10% of the peroxisomes  <cit> . thus, actual mitochondria-targeted  proteins may localize in part via mdvs to peroxisomes.

since the aforementioned findings complicate the peroxisomal targeting prediction, more data on the structure of pts-containing proteins and dynamics of peroxisome targeting process are needed to derive better prediction models. dynamic changes in protein location depending on the cell conditions can be captured by location proteomics  <cit> . the genome-based central dogma  tagging approach  <cit>  which does not affect endogenous regulatory sequences combined with high throughput microscopy movies successfully detected previously unknown cell cycle-dependent localization changes of nuclear proteins. the submission and collation of peroxisomal data into growing integrated protein and genetic interaction resources such as biogrid  <cit>  may help in the evaluation of false positives/negatives and improve our understanding of protein sorting to peroxisomal and other subcellular locations.

CONCLUSIONS
the non-peroxisomal localization of all tested pts2-targeted candidates in cho-perred demonstrated the underperformance of computer-aided predictions of pts2-containing sequences. at least pts <dig> prediction methods, including ours will not improve by simply amending algorithms. new experimental data, derived from location proteomics, protein structure analysis, and quantitative pts <dig> peptide pex <dig> binding assays are required to lift the performance of predictions. in a few cases, the presence of a silent pts <dig> indicated the potential for conditional subcellular sorting which might be worthwhile to follow up. the surface accessibility and expression context-dependent pts1-targeting of ehxp <dig>  <cit>  is an encouraging example. as cho cells are considered a model for mammalian peroxisome research, the stable cell line cho-perred is expected to become an effective tool for peroxisomal location research. in view of the growing importance of subcellular localization we suggest to promote the development of other peroxisomal marker cell lines that cover cells of different ontology in parallel to community-agreed computational and experimental standards for peroxisomal localization.
