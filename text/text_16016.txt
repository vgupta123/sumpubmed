BACKGROUND
pectinases have various important applications in plant fiber processing, especially in textile, paper, fruit juice, coffee, and tea fermentation industries
 <cit> . depending on the mode of action and substrate specificity, pectinases involved in such biotechnological interventions can be classified into three major groups: protopectinases, pectinesterase , and pectin depolymerases
 <cit> . among the pectin depolymerases, pectate lyase  has attracted a great deal of interest in the past few decades from both scientific and commercial perspectives. pel is capable of cleaving α- <dig>  linkages in pectate polymers by β-elimination mechanism, producing  <dig> -unsaturated oligogalacturonates
 <cit> . pectin, composed of partially methylesterified pectate, is more commonly used as a natural substrate in fiber crop degumming and retting processes, as it is an essential component in the middle lamella and the primary cell wall of higher plants
 <cit> . therefore, pels that are capable of depolymerizing methylesterified substrates are more useful for industrial application. for instance, in textile processing, a crucial step for successful scouring of fabric is wax and pectin removal
 <cit> , which is generally performed under high temperature and high alkaline conditions that cause serious environment impacts and raw material loss. therefore, it is desirable to develop pels with high thermostability and alkalistability, which can be used as the ideal candidates for both commercially viable and environmentally responsible bioprocesses.

pectolytic enzymes are ubiquitous in nature, and most of the pels previously reported have been isolated from microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi
 <cit> . industrial applications of bacterial alkaline pels, the majority of which occur in the bacillus and pseudomonas genus, have been extensively studied
 <cit> . however, in terms of practical bioprocesses, only a few of them are robust enough to undergo long-time bioprocess treatment. recently, enzymes originating from thermophilic or alkaliphilic microorganisms are garnering more interest
 <cit>  because of their good performance at extreme temperature or ph. although only limited information on the alkaliphilic strains of paenibacillus spp. exists, several pels from this genus have proved to be highly stable
 <cit> . hence, these bacteria have great potential for industrial-scale production of novel enzymes with desirable compatibility between the optimal temperature/ph and the extended useful life.

in the present study, we cloned the gene of a pel  from paenibacillus sp.  <dig> isolated and identified from high alkaline soil based on its capacity of producing pel. the biochemical properties of the recombinant peln were comprehensively studied, which suggested its tolerance to high temperature, alkaline condition, and methylated substrates. the production of the recombinant peln was accomplished in an efficient escherichia coli secretory expression system, which achieved the highest yield in shake flasks reported so far with a high secretion capability. the biochemical degumming experiments of peln suggested its favourable efficiency in ramie fiber bast degumming and various potential applications in biotechnology processes, especially in textile industry.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
a dna fragment of 128 bp was obtained in degenerate pcr. the subsequent blast search in genbank suggested that this fragment was a part of a pel gene. the assembly of this fragment with the sequence obtained in inverse pcr with specific primers of this fragment produced a nucleotide of 2740 bp which consisted of the complete orf of a pel gene  and its flanking fragments. a putative promoter was predicted to be in the upstream region of the orf, and the − <dig> and − <dig> regions were “5′-tttaca-3′” and “5′-tattat-3′,” respectively. a typical ribosomal binding site  was also located upstream of the atg initial codon. in addition, in the downstream of the orf, a rho-independent transcription terminator was also identified.

the deduced protein sequence of the orf was found to have  <dig> amino acids, including a typical signal sequence cleaved by the type i signal peptidase 
 <cit> . the signal peptide of  <dig> amino acids comprised a positively charged n-domain with lysine and arginine residues, a hydrophobic h-domain with  <dig> amino acids, and a spase i cleavage site of three amino acids. it was found that the downstream residues of the signal peptide at the n-terminus of the mature protein also contributed to the cleavage site recognition
 <cit> . the consensus sequence gagg of pels, which was predicted to form the cleavage signal at the mature protein side
 <cit> , was also present in the n-terminus of peln in the form of gagg. analysis of the msa of peln and other pels with solved structures from the pl <dig> family identified three conserved sequence patterns and a set of invariant amino acids located within the peln peptide . the conserved sequence patterns used to characterize a novel sequence as a pel are axdikgxxxxvtxs, vwidh, and vxxrxpxxrxgxxhxxxn
 <cit> . the invariant amino acids involved in catalytic function mainly comprised the catalytic residues r <dig>  k <dig>  and r <dig>  and the ca2+-binding residues d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> in peln. six single mutants of these key residues, obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, resulted in almost completely inactive proteins, as shown in [additional file
1].

according to the cazy database , pels occur within five pl families: pl <dig>  pl <dig>  pl <dig>  pl <dig>  and pl <dig>  the blast  search against the ncbi database indicated that peln is the closest to the pl <dig> family sequences. the deduced amino acid sequence of peln exhibited 67-90% identity with the corresponding amino acid sequences from the same genus .

expression and purification of peln
peln without the signal sequence was successfully expressed in the recombinant e. coli bl <dig>  in shake-flask cultivation mode . under the optimal induction condition in this case , the highest extracellular and total pel activities reached  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> u ml− <dig> after 42-h cultivation, respectively, with a high secretion capability of  <dig> %.

peln was purified from the crude extract of e. coli bl <dig>  harbouring pet-peln. the two-step purification resulted in a three-fold increase in purity with a yield of 29%, and the purified protein had a specific activity of  <dig>  u mg− <dig> on pga . furthermore, peln generated a single electrophoretic band on the sds-page gel at 48 kda, corresponding to the calculated molecular weight .

recombinant enzyme characterization
optimum ph and temperature
the purified peln displayed activity over a wide range of ph from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with a maximum activity at ph  <dig>  . the effect of temperature on the peln activity was measured at the optimal ph of  <dig>  and different temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 70°c. the pel activity increased gradually from  <dig> %  at 35°c to the maximum of 100%  at 65°c and then decreased sharply to  <dig> %  at 70°c and  <dig> %  at 75°c .

the effects of different metal ions and chemicals
the effects of various metal ions and chemicals were determined under the standard reaction condition. we found that peln exhibited robust tolerance to several metal ions, and only ba2+ caused a severe loss of activity . on the other hand, triton x- <dig> and tween- <dig> had negligible influence on the activity . similar to the majority of pels, peln required ca2+ for its maximal activity. the presence of  <dig>  mm ca2+ in pl buffer  increased enzyme activity by more than 7-fold, while no activity was detected with the addition of  <dig>  and 1 mm edta, indicating that ca2+ plays an important role in the catalytic reaction of peln. hence, we also determined the optimal ca2+ concentration . in particular, peln activity was found to be considerably elevated with the addition of  <dig> –2 mm ca2+, but was inhibited at a high concentration of more than 5 mm ca2+.

nd: no detectable activity.

protein stability
as the fiber degumming process could be accelerated under alkaline conditions
 <cit> , a favourable alkalistability of pels is essentially required for many industrial processes. to explore this potential, the ph-dependent stability of the enzyme was further investigated by pre-incubation for 1 h at 45°c at varying ph values . the purified peln was found to be stable over a ph range of  <dig> – <dig>  and was most stable at ph  <dig> .

on the other hand, the long-term thermostability of pels is a crucial aspect from the industrial perspective
 <cit> . to investigate the effect of temperature on enzyme stability, peln was incubated at different temperatures at ph of  <dig> , and the samples were drawn at various time points. the results indicated that the recombinant peln was considerably stable at  <dig> and 50°c, with activities decreased to only  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, after 12-h incubation. the half-life values of peln were approximately  <dig>  min at 45°c, 550 min at 50°c, 50 min at 55°c, and  <dig>  min at 60°c, respectively . the effect of temperature on protein structural stability was studied by carrying out the dsc experiment, and the melting temperature midpoint  of the purified peln was found to be  <dig> °c . besides, thermally induced denaturation was irreversible for peln, as no detectable energy transition was observed in a second scan of the corresponding samples.

substrate specificity
the enzyme activities on pectins were also investigated under the standard condition. as shown in table 
 <dig>  peln exhibited relatively high activity on methylated substrates. on pectin with relatively low degree  of methylation, the remaining specific activity of peln was approximately 100% of that on pga. high methylated pectin  resulted in slight inhibition of the peln activity, which was still higher than 74%.

subsequently, the dependence of the enzyme reaction rate on substrate concentration was investigated under the standard conditions using pga and both the types of pectins, respectively. the kinetic parameters of peln were found to vary considerably on different substrates. the corresponding vmax of peln on pga was  <dig>  mol mg−1 min− <dig>  which was  <dig> -fold higher than that on 20–34% methylated pectin, and  <dig> -fold lower than that on highly methylated pectin. the affinity of peln, indicated by km, for 20–34% methylated pectin, was lower than that for the other two substrates, whereas the catalytic efficiency, indicated by kcat/km, on pga was similar to that on low methylated pectin and was much higher than that on highly methylated pectin.

treatment of ramie bast fiber
the enzymatic degumming processing of ramie fiber was optimised in terms of the enzyme dose at 50°c. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the unsaturated oligogalacturonic acid releasing peaked at  <dig>  μmol ml− <dig> after 3-h treatment with 500u ml− <dig> of peln, and an increase in either enzyme dose or treatment time had no significant effect on the degumming reactions. however, when chemically pre-treated ramie fibers were subsequently treated with 500u ml− <dig> of peln at 50°c, the unsaturated oligogalacturonic acid released reached  <dig>  μmol ml− <dig> after 3-h of enzymatic treatment. accordingly, the percent weight loss of ramie fiber treated by 500u ml− <dig> of peln and the combined biochemical method reached the maximums  after 3-h of enzymatic treatment. compared with chemical treatment, in which the percent weight loss of ramie fiber peaked at  <dig> % after 6-h of 2% naoh treatment at 90°c, the combined biochemical method seemed to be more effective and economical. the fibers were also observed using an sem, and the sample after biochemical treatment showed the smoothest surface in our experiments , suggesting that the gum-like material could be mostly removed by the combined method.

discussion
in this study, the encoding gene of a pel from a paenibacillus strain previously isolated from high alkaline soil was cloned. heterologously production of this protein was accomplished using the recombinant e. coli bl <dig> . compared with the highest yield of pel in e. coli previously reported by fang et al.
 <cit> , the extracellular pel production achieved in the present study exhibited an  <dig> -fold increase, and the secretory capability increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. pels have also been expressed in other expression systems, such as b. subtilis <cit>  and pichia pastoris <cit> , among which the highest yield reported previously was  <dig>  u ml− <dig> in b. subtilis after 44-h cultivation in a  <dig> -l fermentor
 <cit> . this is  <dig> -fold lower than the production reported in this study. moreover, compared with the b. subtilis expression system, the production of pel using e. coli offers several important advantages. these include more reliable carriers of recombinant plasmids and no sporulation under stress conditions, which are propitious for large-scale industrial production. the secretory expression strategy of peln proposed in this study achieved a relatively higher secretion capability. this strategy has not only overcome the limitations of inclusion body formation, but also significantly simplified the downstream processing of this enzyme, as the fermentation broth could be directly used in fiber degumming.

furthermore, biochemical properties of the recombinant peln were also investigated in the present study. the optimal ph of this enzyme showed a similarity with the majority of alkaline pels previously reported
 <cit> . nevertheless, except for a few hyperthermophilic pels
 <cit> , the optimal temperature  of peln was much higher than those of the common pels from p. amylolyticus <cit> , bacillus sp.
 <cit>  and b. subtilis 168
 <cit>  . since a moderate temperature  has often been applied in practical bioscouring processing, most of the enzymatic assays were carried out at  <dig> or 50°c in the present study, at which the relative activity was only  <dig> % or  <dig> % of the maximum, but was still practical.

the effect of calcium ions that play an important role in the activity of peln was also investigated. on one hand, the activity of this enzyme was further elevated with the increase of ca2+ concentration until apparent saturation was reached. on the other hand, the activity of peln could not be detected in the presence of metal cation chelator. zheng et al.
 <cit>  found that in crystals of different pels of the pl <dig> family, the numbers of ca2+ ions and the corresponding binding residues differed from each other. this suggests that the variety of the numbers of ca2+-binding residues may be responsible for different modes of the calcium dependence of pels. in the case of peln, three aspartates  were predicted to bind to two ca2+ ions [additional file
1] by msa analysis . moreover, asp <dig> was found to have a more significant impact on the catalysis than the other two aspartates, presumably due to its potential interaction with both ca2+ ions. similar ca2+-binding mode, residues and dependence were also observed in pel from a marine strain t. maritima <cit> . as aspartates are capable of binding to several types of cations, addition of mg2+ and zn2+ could slightly enhance the enzyme activity. this phenomenon has been previously observed in other pels, such as pelz from e. chrysanthemi <cit>  and pel <dig> from b. pumilus bs22
 <cit> , when using various divalent cations as cofactors.

one of the most attractive properties of peln is its robust thermo-alkalistability. in fiber bioscouring, alkaline environment and moderate temperature are required for effective degumming and fiber quality improvement. therefore, enzyme stability under such conditions is a key property for commercially viable bioprocesses. similar to most pels, peln showed maximum activity under alkaline conditions. moreover, this protein was found to be very stable over a wide ph range and exhibited highest stability in stronger alkaline solution , thereby meeting the requirements of the textile industrial bioscouring processes. as a thermostable candidate, pela from the hyperthermophilic bacterium t. maritima, with an optimal temperature of 90°c and 2-h half-life at 95°c, has been found to be the most thermoactive pel characterized to date
 <cit> . meanwhile, researchers have also made significant efforts to improve the thermostability of pel. for example, sequence-based knowledge has provided potential amino acid substitutions for stability optimization of pelii from xanthomonas campestris, leading to a 23-fold increase in its half-life  at 45°c
 <cit> . as the half-life of peln has been demonstrated to be longer than 41 h at 45°c, it can be considered to be an ideal candidate for further engineering for large-scale industrial application when similar strategies are deployed.

another notable feature of peln is its activities on both pga and various methylated pectins. it has been reported that the degree of methylation of naturally occurring pectins is about 70%
 <cit> , thus making the robust activity of peln on highly methylated substrates an attractive property for practical applications. to date, most of the reported pels have been found to be capable of degrading pga or low methylated substrates more efficiently than highly methylated pectins 
 <cit> . notably, peln demonstrated a similar activity on pga and 20–34% methylated pectin, and its activity on 55–70% methylated pectin remained 74%. comparison of the determined km values of the recombinant peln suggested that the enzyme exhibited an approximately  <dig> -fold increase in the affinity for pga and highly methylated pectin  than that for pectin with a low degree  of methylation. in contrast, the specificity constant kcat/km values of peln decreased with the increasing degree of methylation of the substrate. it has been reported that the km values of pels from bacillus sp.
 <cit> , b. licheniformis <cit> , x. campestris <cit>  and streptomyces sp. s27
 <cit>  on pga range from  <dig>  and  <dig>  g l− <dig>  although the km value determined for peln on pga falls within this range, it is much higher than those of other bacterial pels
 <cit> , indicating relatively lower substrate affinity. interestingly, in the case of pelii from x. campestris <cit> , the km value was reported to be only  <dig>  g l− <dig>  which was  <dig> -fold lower than that of peln, while the kcat value of pelii was much lower  than that of peln. thus, the catalytic efficiency of peln indicated by kcat/km was more favorable.

in the degumming experiments, the biochemical method developed in our research has proved to be more effective and milder than conventional chemical treatment. moreover, the total processing time was reduced from 6 h to  <dig>  h. in earlier reports, the natural producers of pels were used directly in the bio-degumming
 <cit> . in such cases, inducible pels and/or other pectin-degrading enzymes are secreted into the media by microorganisms, break down the pectin polymers and then provide nutrients for the producers
 <cit> . the enzyme production and degumming occur in the same process; however, the processing time is significantly prolonged because of bacterial adaptation and the low yield of pels in low-cost degumming media. for example, it took  <dig> and 48-h incubation of the alkaliphilic bacteria bacillus sp. nt- <dig> and nt- <dig>  respectively, to remove the gum of more than  <dig> % of the fibers
 <cit> , and 24-h incubation of b. pumilus to cause the weight loss of the ramie fiber by 25%
 <cit> . degumming performed by enzymes from fermentation supernatant of recombinant producers was demonstrated to be more practical. pel <dig> from the b. subtilis  <dig> was produced by recombinant p. pastoris, and used in ramie fiber degumming. the results showed that the textile lost 15% weight after 1-h treatment and only suffered from a minimal detrimental effect for fibers
 <cit> . admittedly, chemical treatment outperforms enzymatic method in terms of gum removal rate. the combined treatment used in our experiments and other studies
 <cit>  was demonstrated to considerably reduce the consumption of chemicals and energy, thus making itself more economical and eco-friendly.

CONCLUSIONS
a pectate lyase gene from paenibacillus sp.  <dig> was cloned and overproduced in e. coli bl <dig> . the enzyme exhibited favourable alkalistability, with a maximum residual activity after incubation at ph  <dig>  for 1 h, and showed promising thermostability, with the highest activity level at 65°c and long-term half-life at  <dig> and 50°c. furthermore, this enzyme was capable of maintaining high specific activities on methylated pectin. in ramie degumming processing, the combined biochemical method with the advantage of reduced process time and energy consumption was found to be a promising substitute to traditional alkaline treatment characterized by high pollution. these findings, together with its high production in the recombinant e. coli bl <dig> , highlight the industrial application potential of this enzyme as a key enzyme in mild and cost-effective bioresource industries in textile, paper-making, and pectic wastewater treatment.
