BACKGROUND
intrabodies are defined as antibody molecules which are ectopically expressed inside the cell  <cit> . the concept of using intrabodies can result in the induction of a phenotypic knockout either by directly inhibiting the function of the targeted antigen or by diverting a protein from its normal intracellular location  <cit> . the main advantage of using intrabodies instead of rna inhibition is that the inhibition is done at the protein level. as such, it is possible to target post-translational modifications or a specific conformation of the antigen  <cit> . in addition, by targeting antibody molecules to specific subcellular compartments using addressing signals  <cit> , the intrabody induced phenotypic knockout can be restrained to a specific cell compartment. altogether, this makes intrabodies a very promising tool for the study of protein function in vivo  <cit>  and for the development of highly specific therapies  <cit> .

one of the main problems associated with intrabodies is that most scfvs are not able to fold under the reducing conditions of the cell cytosol and nucleus, where most of the interesting targets are located. this is thought to be due to the limited stability of scfvs after the two conserved disulfide bonds are reduced, as occurs in the cell cytosol  <cit> . indeed, in vitro, most of the scfvs cannot be renatured under reducing conditions  <cit> . to be an efficient intrabody a scfv must thus present a high in vitro stability  <cit> . recent studies using either statistical analyses of scfv sequences  <cit>  or an experimental approach  <cit>  have shown that less than 1% of the scfvs are stable enough to be high quality intrabodies and that only about 10% have a "moderate chance" to be functional in vivo. in addition, even if a scfv protein is indeed stable enough in its reduced form to be expressed and active in vivo, other parameters such as protease susceptibility  <cit>  or folding kinetics  <cit>  may also influence the final in vivo fate of the protein and are critical for intrabody expression and activity  <cit> .

in order to get an active intrabody it is thus usually needed to screen several clones in vivo, looking for the best expressed scfv with a biological activity. in order to facilitate this step, it has been proposed to first screen interesting clones using two-hybrid systems before testing them in cells  <cit>  or even to select them directly in yeast  <cit> . several very potent intrabodies have been isolated with such approaches  <cit>  and this has allowed the isolation of several highly stable antibody frameworks  <cit> .

as a more general strategy authors have proposed to stabilize scfvs in vivo using a fusion partner like the maltose binding protein  <cit>  or to construct a scfv library tailored for intracellular expression  <cit> . ideally, such a library should only contain scfvs able to fold under the reducing conditions that pertain in the cell cytoplasm. several groups have constructed antibody libraries based on a small number  <cit>  or even a single framework  <cit> . in addition, several studies have shown that the framework stability and folding properties are at least partially conserved upon loop grafting to confer a new specificity. this is both true in the periplasm  <cit>  and in the cytoplasm  <cit>  of escherichia coli for scfv and vhh domains  <cit> . these findings suggest that it may be possible to construct a scfv library based on a single optimized framework for intrabody selection.

we have recently obtained by molecular evolution a human scfv, called scfv13r <dig>  which is expressed at high levels in e.coli cytoplasm  <cit> . this scfv is also expressed under a soluble and active conformation in yeast  <cit>  and mammalian cells  <cit> . this scfv is very stable in vitro and can be renatured in presence of a reducing agent. in addition, analysis of its folding kinetics showed that it folds faster than the parent scfv and aggregates more slowly in vitro  <cit> . the mutations isolated are mainly located in the vh domain and seem to be highly specific to this particular scfv since they cannot be transferred to a very homologous vh domain  <cit> . interestingly, most of these mutations decreased the homology between the original scfv <dig> sequence and the intrabody consensus sequence described by visintin et al.  <cit>  underlining again their non-general nature.

in this paper, we have constructed a human scfv library, based on the framework of the optimized scfv13r <dig>  that contains more than a billion clones. by using optimized cdr <dig> loops and filtering steps to eliminate the non-expressed clones, we only retained in the library the cytoplasmically expressed scfvs without compromising the diversity, as tested with several proteins used as antigen. most of the scfvs in the library are expressed in e.coli and in mammalian cytoplasm, and are functional as intrabodies. this new library is a promising tool for facile and large-scale selection of functional intrabodies.

RESULTS
the aim of this project was to construct and validate a human scfv library, based on a single framework, optimized for intracellular expression and displayed on filamentous phage. to achieve this goal, the following principles have been used during library construction : i) we used the antibody framework of the previously optimized scfv13r <dig> human scfv  <cit> ; ii) we introduced diversity only in the cdr <dig> loops and mainly in the h <dig> region by using degenerate oligonucleotides  <cit> ; iii) we designed the oligonucleotides so as to have the same representation of the amino acids as that observed in natural human cdr <dig> loops  <cit> ; iv) we removed the non expressed vh and vl sequences by fusing the scfv genes to the cat enzyme and selecting for cam resistance  <cit> . altogether, these principles should result in a large fully human synthetic scfv library optimized for intrabody selection.

a database of human cdr <dig> sequences
we compiled human cdr <dig> sequences from three main sources: the kabat database  <cit> , the imgt database  <cit>  and the rcsb pdb  <cit> . after removing the duplicates, the database contained  <dig> h <dig>   <dig> λ cdr <dig> and  <dig> κ cdr <dig> unique sequences . it can be noted that most of the h <dig> sequences were unique since, for instance, in the kabat database,  <dig> h <dig> sequences  were found only once among the  <dig> complete h <dig> sequences. the result was comparable in the case of l <dig> and k <dig> since, respectively, 74% and 64% of the sequences were unique in the kabat database. this underlines the very high variability of the human cdr <dig> sequences.

as noted by several authors, this variability is not evenly distributed in the loop, and the frequency of each amino acid varies from one position to another and for each loop length  <cit> . in addition, the amino acid distribution depends on the animal origin of the antibody sequence  <cit> . this bias can be due to a structural constraint as for instance in the case of the antepenultimate residue which is frequently an aspartate  and plays an important role in the switch between the extended and the kinked conformation of the h <dig>  <cit> . in other cases, this bias may only be due to the limited number of sequences available for the d and j segments, and amino acids other than those found in natural antibodies may be tolerated  <cit> . for the construction of the library we decided to make cdr3s that mimic the natural distribution for two main reasons: i) we wanted the scfvs generated to be as human as possible for possible use in human therapy  <cit> ; ii) since the antibodies found in the database are functional, maintaining their amino acid distribution will more likely result in functional antibodies, since we incorporated at each position only the amino acids tolerated in natural antibody cdrs  <cit> .

cdr <dig> sequences from the database were aligned by length, and the frequency for each of the  <dig> possible amino acids at each position and for each loop length were calculated. in the case of the light chain cdr3s, sequences were analyzed independently for each class. in the case of the h <dig> sequences, this resulted in  <dig> tables, one for each h <dig> length between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. for a loop of length n, this table contained  <dig> n frequencies. this is illustrated in figure 1c with the  <dig> amino acid long h <dig> loop case . the only strongly variable position was the position  <dig> where the most frequent amino acid  was only present in 16% of the loops. this is not surprising since this residue is frequently in contact with the antigen  <cit> . by contrast, strong biases were observed at position  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the number of highly variable positions increased with the loop length but, in all the cases, none of the positions was truly random. for the other loop lengths, the frequencies are given in additional file  <dig> "amino acid distribution in cdr3s".

design of the oligonucleotides encoding the cdr <dig> loops
eighteen oligonucleotides were designed to follow the amino acid distribution found in the compiled cdr <dig> database. we used  <dig> optimized mixes of the four nucleotides at each position of the codon to match as well as possible the desired amino acid distribution . plots showing the target and the oligonucleotide-encoded distributions are given in additional file  <dig> "amino acid distribution in cdr3s". the process is illustrated in figure 1c with the  <dig> amino acid long h <dig> loops. d bars represent the frequencies of the  <dig> amino acids in the human database at the  <dig> positions. t bars are the expected frequencies with the optimized mixes . due to the constraint of the genetic code, some positions were not perfectly optimized. for instance, at position  <dig>  alanine and glycine were under-represented in our mix and we had to introduce a substantial amount of some non naturally found amino acids like cysteine in order to match other amino acid frequencies. there was however a good overall agreement between the database and the oligonucleotide-encoded frequencies since the most frequently found amino acids were represented in the library and the rare ones were most of the time present at a low frequency. the sequences of the  <dig> degenerate oligonucleotides used to construct the cdr <dig> loops are given in additional file  <dig> "sequences of the spiked oligonucleotides used to introduce the random cdr <dig> loops".

construction of the library
we constructed independent libraries for each cdr <dig> loop length. this was done independently for the heavy and the two classes of light chains. for each library, random cdr <dig> loops were introduced by pcr and the resulting library cloned back in the scfv13r <dig> gene fused to the cat gene in vector pscfvΔcat . this resulted in libraries of scfv13r <dig> clones with one and only one randomized cdr <dig> loop.

we validated the approach by first constructing the  <dig> amino acid long h <dig> loop library. we sequenced  <dig> randomly chosen clones and the frequencies of the  <dig> amino acids at each of the five positions are shown in figure 1c . some positions diverged from the expected values as, for instance, the glycine at position  <dig>  which is over-represented in our library. however, on average, the distribution in the library matched the expected distribution. this showed that the quality of the oligonucleotides was good enough for the approach and that the resulting library followed the natural distribution of the amino acid in human h <dig> loops.

using this approach, we constructed  <dig> vh libraries with h <dig> loops ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids since more than 85% of the human h <dig> lengths are within this range. the same strategy was used for the vl libraries. we introduced random cdr <dig> loops of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids modeled on the human κ loops and ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids for those modeled on the human λ loop sequences. these loop lengths represented respectively 81% and 85% of the human cdr <dig> loops in the database. the  <dig> libraries were constructed and contained at least  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones each .

a initial diversity of the library cloned as fusion with cat and selected on ampicillin. this is the number of clones obtained after transformation.

b between  <dig> and  <dig> clones from the transformation were checked on cam plates. plates were incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c and colony size estimated. columns ++,+ and - give, respectively, the fraction of clones that grew normally, gave tiny colonies, and did not grow at all.

c diversity of the libraries selected on cam. the diversity is estimated from column "initial diversity" and "cam phenotype" by assuming that the final diversity is close to  × . the real diversity may be a higher since some of the clones noted + in column "cam phenotype" may be present in low abundance.

some of these clones, however, may not be functional as a result of the cloning steps  or because of a poor expression level in the bacterial cytoplasm. to remove these non functional scfvs, we selected for clones expressed in the bacterial cytoplasm by means of a fusion between the scfv and the cat enzyme  <cit> . we tested different cam concentrations for this selection step ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml. at the highest concentration, the library was indeed enriched in well-expressed scfvs, but also in clones containing recombined plasmids harboring partial or complete deletions of the scfv gene . we thus plated the libraries on a medium cam concentration . this concentration was high enough to remove all the non-expressed or strongly aggregating scfvs but did not result in a detectable amount of plasmids harboring scfv deletion. the size of the libraries of expressed scfv was thus estimated as the product of the original library size  by the frequency of the camr clones. the sizes of the  <dig> libraries ranged from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> .

the  <dig> cam selected libraries were assembled in amounts proportional to the natural distribution of cdr <dig> loop lengths in human antibodies to give a final library of more than a billion of clones. since the theoretical possible diversity is about  <dig> , it is very unlikely to obtain twice the same clone in the final library. one hundred and eighteen clones were sequenced to determine loop lengths and sequences. as shown in figure  <dig>  all the introduced lengths except  <dig> for the h <dig> were found in the library.  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid long h <dig> loops were under-represented in the library. this is presumably due to the poor quality of these oligonucleotides as shown by their profile on an agilent bioanalizer . h <dig> loop lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> were over-represented in the library but only by a two-fold factor. the h <dig> loop lengths between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, which are the most frequently found in human antibodies, were all present in the library. the number of sequenced clones was too small to analyze the frequency of the amino acids found in the cdr <dig> loops. except for some contaminations with the original scfv13r <dig> sequence , no cdr <dig> sequence was found twice in the sequenced clones. the sequences of the  <dig> clones are shown in the additional file  <dig> "sequence of randomly picked clones".

cytoplasmic expression of scfvs
the idea underlying the library construction is that the cam selection step of the vh and vl libraries should result in only expressed scfv proteins. indeed, since only the cdr <dig> loops are modified between scfv13r <dig> and the libraries, most of the interface residues between the two domains are conserved between clones  <cit> . it is thus likely that any vh will assemble correctly with any vl and that the expression level of the resulting scfv will be close to that of both clones from the vh and vl libraries selected on cam. we tested this hypothesis by picking random clones of the final library and expressing them in e.coli cytoplasm and in mammalian cytosol.

twenty clones were tested in e.coli and  <dig> of them showed some soluble expression in the cytoplasm . one-fourth of the clones  were expressed at very high levels since the scfvs were clearly visible on a coomassie stained gel. to obtain a more global view of the soluble expression levels in e.coli, the library was cloned in front of the gfpuv gene under the control of the t <dig> promoter. if the scfv is soluble and expressed in the cytoplasm, this should result in gfp activity that can be directly monitored on an uv transilluminator  <cit> . about  <dig> clones were tested for the presence of detectable gfp activity and approximately 60% exhibited a gfp+ phenotype  showing again that most of the scfv clones from the library were expressed in e.coli cytoplasm.

we next tested the expression of the library in mammalian cells. fifteen scfvs were cloned in a mammalian expression vector as fusions with the egfp gene and under the control of the sv <dig> early promoter, then transfected in hela cells. typical results are shown in figure  <dig>  three clones were expressed at a high soluble level, comparable to that of the parental scfv13r <dig> ,  <dig> scfvs were found to be mainly soluble but some aggregated material was still present in the cell  and  <dig> clones accumulated essentially as cytoplasmic aggregates , as observed with the hybridoma-derived anti-oncoprotein e <dig> scfv 1f <dig>   <cit> . in conclusion, thirteen out of the fifteen scfvs tested were expressed as soluble proteins that could be easily detected in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of the transfected cells.

altogether these results showed that more than 85% of the clones from the final library expressed soluble scfv in e.coli  and mammalian cytoplasm , while about 20% of them expressed scfv at a very high level . this is a great improvement over the results obtained by other authors with non optimized scfv libraries  <cit> .

selection of binders
as shown above, the library contains a high proportion of expressed clones but it remains to be shown that antibodies against particular proteins can be selected. we thus used the phage displayed library to select for binders against five different antigens using purified proteins adsorbed on microtiter plates. we performed three rounds of selection and the eluted phages were tested by elisa against the immobilized antigens. as shown in figure 5a, in all the cases a positive signal was obtained after a single round of selection. this signal increased strongly after two rounds and did not increase further during the third round of selection. this very fast selection process was presumably due both to the focused library itself, which contains only expressed scfvs resulting in a low background, and to the use of a trypsin-sensitive helper phage that further decreased the background level  <cit> .

we next tested whether the library contained clones expressing soluble scfvs in the periplasm. the non-suppressive hb <dig> strain was infected with the phages eluted after the third round of selection against tubulin, gst:syk and the core histones. periplasmic extracts were prepared and tested for binding activity by elisa . in the three cases, 12–20% of the clones gave a strong signal with absorbance values higher than  <dig>   and about 30% were clearly positive with an absorbance value higher than  <dig>  . these results compared favorably with those reported with other scfv libraries, underlining again the high proportion of well-expressed clones present in the library. in addition, this showed that our cat fusion approach selected efficiently for constructs without stop codons present in the oligonucleotides. this is indeed of premium importance to isolate soluble scfvs from phage-displayed libraries since amber stop codons in cdrs are frequently selected during panning of synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries  <cit> .

in both the previous characterizations, the scfvs were expressed under oxidizing conditions in e.coli periplasm, either as scfv-piii fusion or as soluble protein. in addition, panning was done on phage, again under oxidizing conditions. we could not exclude that the selection and the screen introduced a bias towards clones expressed in the periplasm at the expense of those expressed in the cytoplasm. to test that the selected scfvs were indeed also expressed in the cytoplasm, we subcloned the same pool of clones  in a cytoplasmic expression vector under the control of the strong t <dig> promoter. for each antigen, ninety-five clones were tested by elisa for binding to their respective antigen. in each case, the number of positive clones was comparable or even better than in the periplasmic screen . for instance, in the case of gst:syk, 80% of the tested clones were positive after three rounds of selection. this demonstrated that the periplasmic selection step did not decrease the proportion of soluble scfvs in the cytoplasm and that by using our library it is not necessary to directly select within the cytoplasm to avoid introducing a bias during the selection  <cit> .

we sequenced individual clones from the 2nd and the 3rd round of selection against tubulin . most of the clones were different since only one clone from the 2nd round and one from the 3rd round were found twice. this demonstrated that a high diversity is still present after  <dig> rounds of selection. eight of the anti-tubulin scfvs were purified by affinity chromatography from the cytoplasm. in all cases, more than  <dig> mg of scfv was purified from one liter of cells grown in a flask , and some scfvs were expressed at a level per cell comparable to the exceptionally high expression level reported for an anti-her <dig> in e. coli periplasm   <cit> . this expression level corresponds to about 1/4th of that of the original scfv13r <dig> but this may be presumably increased by using optimized protocols.

functionality of isolated scfvs as intrabodies
to determine if the isolated scfvs were able to bind to their target in vivo we characterized the anti-histones scfvs expressed in human cells. the third round of selection was cloned in vector p513-egfp and ten randomly chosen clones were transfected in hela cells. typical results of the cells expressing the scfv-egfp fusions and observed by fluorescence microscopy are shown in figure  <dig>  one scfv was expressed as cytoplasmic aggregates. four scfvs were expressed as soluble cytoplasmic proteins, as judged by the homogeneous staining of the cells, at a level comparable to that of the scfv13r <dig>  finally, three scfvs gave rise to a strong staining of the nucleus  and, two scfvs were exclusively localized in the nucleus . since these scfvs fused to the egfp were expressed in the cytoplasm of the cell and did not contain a nuclear localization signal, this suggested that they were able to interact in vivo with the histones and were thus active inside the cell  <cit> . this analysis showed that about half of the clones present after the third round of selection against core histones were able to bind to their nuclear target in vivo. this was confirmed in vitro by western and dot blot with purified scfv . in addition, sequencing of the five positive clones showed that they contained different heavy and light chain cdr <dig> regions .

in vitro characterization of anti-tubulin scfvs
to demonstrate the activity of the anti-tubulin scfv under the reducing conditions that pertain in the cell cytoplasm, we extracted the scfvs in presence of a reducing agent and we compared the elisa signal with that obtained with the scfvs extracted under oxidizing conditions. as shown in figure  <dig>  the five scfvs gave the same elisa signal in both conditions, demonstrating the full activity of the scfvs under reducing conditions and thus in absence of disulfide bond formation.

the five scfvs were able to recognize unfolded tubulin by western blot in brain extracts and the native protein in a competition elisa . finally, we tested their ability to interact with microtubules in cells by if. clones 2f12c and 2g4c, but no the three other scfvs, were able to reveal the microtubule network in cells. in figure  <dig> is illustrated the utility of this new library as a source for both in vivo and in vivo proteomic studies: hela cells were transfected with the anti-histones clone  <dig> fused to a red-gfp then the microtubule network was revealed by if using the 2f12c scfv.

finally, we characterized clone 2f12c by biacore since it was the best binder in elisa and if. data were fitted to a two-state reaction model giving a kd of  <dig> nm . this value is comparable to those obtained for the best scfvs obtained with other single framework libraries with variability restrained to the cdr <dig> loops  <cit> .

altogether, our results show that the library described in this report is highly diverse and functional and allows fast and easy isolation of in vivo and in vitro active fully human intrabodies.

discussion
as noted by several authors  <cit> , despite very interesting applications in the proteomic  <cit>  and therapeutic fields  <cit> , intracellular immunization remains a difficult approach, and its full potential in the post-genomic area remains to be demonstrated. the usual approach to obtain efficient intrabodies requires two successive steps. first, a panel of antibodies against the target antigen must be isolated. due to the availability of very high quality naive antibody libraries displayed on phage, this step is now easily accomplished by phage-display and can be automated in order to isolate binders against several proteins in parallel  <cit> . in a second step, these antibody fragments  must be tested in vivo for their ability to inhibit their target. however, most scfvs do not fold properly under the reducing conditions that pertain in the cytosol and the nucleus of the cell where most of the interesting targets are located. this results in the formation of aggregated and inactive scfvs, unable to interact with their target. this makes the process of identifying intrabodies from regular scfv libraries a difficult procedure even when the screening is done in vivo using two-hybrid system  <cit> . in addition, this low proportion of active scfvs in the current libraries makes the isolation of intrabodies against different epitopes of the same protein at best difficult if not impossible. more recently, to avoid this two-step procedure, visintin and collaborators  <cit>  demonstrated that it is possible to directly select, in a single step, efficient intrabodies in yeast using the two-hybrid system. however, the relatively low efficiency of yeast transformation restrained the size of the library to  <dig> 

in this report we describe the construction and use of a large phage displayed library of scfvs optimized for intracellular expression. the library was constructed on a single antibody framework previously evolved to improve its activity inside the cytoplasm  <cit> . the parental scfv is very stable, has favorable folding and aggregation kinetics  <cit>  and is expressed at very high levels in all tested cell types  <cit> . having a single framework for the construction of a library should allow more comparable expression levels between clones since most of their sequences are conserved. in addition, because cdr sequences play also a role in scfv folding and expression, we anticipated that the expression level of the clones would still exhibit some variability. to minimize these differences, we only introduced variability in the cdr <dig> loops for three main reasons: these loops are the most variable in antibodies and are thus more likely to be highly tolerant to sequence and length variations; the parental scfv had gained mutations in the cdr <dig> loops during its evolution process and we did not want to reverse back these mutations; it has been previously shown that introduction of variability in the cdr3s was enough to generate antibodies against most proteins  <cit> . in addition, the frequencies of the amino acids in these loops were carefully biased so as to recover the distribution observed among natural human sequences. when the expression levels of randomly picked clones were compared in the cytoplasm, despite some clear differences, a high proportion of them were correctly expressed at high levels both in e.coli and in mammalian cells .

it must be noted that the design of the library allowed in the vl not only the introduction of cdr3s corresponding to the original λ light chain class but also to the κ class. such a hybrid vl domain with full binding properties has been previously realized by grafting λ cdrs on a κ framework  <cit> , and we have also successfully grafted the cdrs from a mouse κ scfv directed against the human papilloma virus e <dig> protein  <cit>  on the scfv13r <dig> λ framework . this is the case of the best isolated anti-tubulin 2f12c scfv since it contains a κ cdr <dig> close to the cdr <dig> sequence encoded by human germline igkv1- <dig>  <cit> . this showed that such grafts can produce functional scfv and that the differences in the sequences of the cdr <dig> loops between the λ and the κ classes are due to evolutionary divergences and not to structural constraints.

a frequent concern when constructing scfv libraries is the simultaneous optimization of the library's diversity and size. indeed, the size of such a library is limited by the transformation efficiency to about  <dig> clones. given this "limited" number of clones, it is thus of premium importance to avoid non-expressed scfvs or duplicates. to solve this problem we used a two-step procedure. first, we constructed  <dig> "small" libraries for each cdr <dig> length  and removed from them all the non-expressed clones by fusion to the cat enzyme, in e.coli cytoplasm, and selection on cam plates. this step reduced each library diversity by about 10–30%. in a second step we recombined the selected vh and vl libraries at random to generate the final diversity. we made the assumption that if a vh and a vl were expressed when associated respectively with the vl13r <dig> and the vh13r <dig>  the scfv constituted with these vh and vl would also be expressed, resulting in a library containing only expressed scfvs. as shown in figure  <dig> this is indeed the case since  <dig> out of  <dig> clones picked at random were expressed at least partially under a soluble form in e.coli cytoplasm. since this selection step was done early during the library construction, the diversity of the final library was only limited by the final transformation. in addition, this recombination step, by generating a high diversity, ensured that all the clones were unique in the final library. altogether, this approach resulted in a library of  <dig>  billion expressed scfvs.

successful use of scfvs as intrabodies on a large scale requires several essential points to be fulfilled by the library. first, the scfv must be easy to isolate. this is the case here since we were able to isolate binders against all the tested proteins . second, the scfv should be able to fold in all the cell compartments, particularly in the reducing ones. again, this is the case for the scfv library described herein, since more than 80% of the tested clones are at least partially soluble in the cell . in addition, we have shown that good cytoplasmic binders can be obtained from the phage selected scfvs in e.coli  and in eukaryotic cells . finally, to get active intrabodies it is important to be able to target any epitope of a protein. it is know that the immune system is able to raise antibodies against essentially any part of the surface of a protein  <cit> , and it remains to be proved that this is also the case with our and other phage displayed libraries. however, the high length diversity introduced in the cdr <dig> loops should favor a broad diversity of paratope shapes  <cit>  and thus of the epitopes recognized.

even if the library has been tailored for the isolation of intrabodies, it can also be used as a general purpose library to select scfvs for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. because we designed the cdr <dig> diversity using expressed human sequences, the scfvs present in the library are fully human and should not induce an anti-scfv antibody response in patients  <cit> . however, for such applications, the affinity of the scfv for its target must be very high in order to get a good sensitivity in a diagnostic test or a strong in vivo effect in therapy. since our library is based on a single framework, it should be fairly easy to improve the affinity of a selected scfv by using, for instance, chain shuffling  <cit> , error-prone mutagenesis  <cit>  or by optimization of the cdr <dig> and cdr <dig> loops  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this new library is a promising tool not only for an easy and large-scale selection of functional intrabodies but also for the isolation of highly expressed scfvs that could be used in numerous biotechnological applications. the availability of scfvs based on a highly stable framework  <cit>  that are obtainable from e. coli in milligram quantities from a  <dig> ml culture  would be very useful for developing antibody arrays. because of the human origin of both the framework and binding site regions  <cit> , scfvs isolated from the library should also have therapeutic applications.
