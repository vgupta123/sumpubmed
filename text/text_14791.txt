BACKGROUND
campylobacter spp. are recognized as the leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the industrialized world  <cit> . in the european union , the incidence of human campylobacteriosis cases has followed an increasing trend in recent times and it continues to be the most commonly reported zoonosis with  <dig>  confirmed cases in  <dig>  <cit> . the majority of the infections are sporadic and seasonal, with a clear incidence peak in the summer months and early autumn  <cit> . although infrequently reported compared with sporadic cases, outbreaks of campylobacteriosis do occur and are often associated with the consumption of raw milk and contaminated drinking water . in finland, waterborne outbreaks caused by enteric pathogens are commonly registered  and c. jejuni was the causative agent in 19% of the recorded outbreaks between  <dig> and  <dig> . this corresponds to approximately two c. jejuni waterborne outbreaks annually. resolving c. jejuni outbreaks is complicated due to a prolonged lag time. a long incubation period  and lengthy diagnostic procedures cause an estimated lag time of approximately 2 weeks between time of exposure and recognition of the waterborne transmission  <cit> . this lag time may hinder the ability to detect c. jejuni from the water source, especially if the drinking water was transiently contaminated  <cit> .

pfge  typing of isolates has been widely used in outbreak investigations. pfge is considered to be the gold standard for source tracking  <cit>  due to the reported stability of pfge genotypes in different host populations , irrespective of temporal and geographical space . however, pfge profiles cannot conclusively establish the clonal relationship between isolates, affecting the epidemiological investigations. bacterial strains with identical pfge or highly similar profiles isolated years apart generally show genetic diversity accumulated by genetic drift, homologous recombination or horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . on the contrary, the genomic differences between epidemiologically linked isolates sharing pfge profiles are expected to be minor since the strains are considered to be the recent expansion of a single clone  <cit> . however, due to limited resolution capacity similar pfge profiles could overestimate the clonal relationship between isolates  <cit> . furthermore, since alterations in the pfge patterns can result from a single genetic event due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a restriction site  <cit> , bacteriophage acquisition or loss or transposition  <cit> , a clonal relationship may exist even between strains with different pfge profiles  <cit> .

whole-genome sequencing  has recently been utilized to increase resolution power in the analysis of outbreak-associated isolates, leading to faster and more precise source identification in outbreak investigations, and to discriminate between alternative epidemiological hypotheses  <cit> . the aim of this study was to explore the applicability of wgs to an outbreak investigation by comparing the genomes of c. jejuni isolates from a finnish waterborne outbreak that had occurred in  <dig>  the outbreak had already been resolved using both epidemiological and environmental analysis tools. all isolates have penner serotype  <dig> and their kpni and sacii profiles were identical, except for one patient isolate that had a three-band difference in the kpni profile and a two-band difference in the sacii profile  <cit> .

RESULTS
genome of c. jejuniwater isolate  <dig> and identification of mobile genetic elements
the combination of paired-end and 5 kb mate-pair library allowed the complete assembly of the genome of c. jejuni strain  <dig>  consisting of a single chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> nucleotides. plasmid dna was not detected. a total of  <dig>  coding dna sequences  were identified in a coding area of  <dig> % and function was predicted for ~73%. the strain belongs to st- <dig> and, as previously observed in certain strains of the st- <dig> complex, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, fucose permease and a secreted l-asparaginase were not detected  <cit> . the lipooligosaccharide  locus resembles class p of c. jejuni gb <dig>  <cit> , which is associated with a non-sialylated los outer core structure without ganglioside mimicry  <cit> . islandviewer predicted the presence of a putative prophage of  <dig>  bp  integrated between locus bn867_ <dig>  and locus bn867_ <dig> . this prophage showed  <dig> % global nucleotide identity with the integrated element cjie <dig> identified in c. jejuni rm <dig>  and it is integrated in the same region of the chromosome. the cjie <dig> element in c. jejuni  <dig> includes  <dig> open reading frames , but a putative function was predicted for only three of these . upon manual inspection, a second region that probably also has a phage origin was detected to be inserted between nucleotide  <dig>   and  <dig>  . pairwise comparison with c. jejuni rm <dig> revealed that this region corresponds to a vestigial mu-like phage of approximately  <dig>  bp : bn867_ <dig> is a homologue to cje <dig>  and bn867_ <dig> is a homologue to cje <dig>  the vestigial mu-like phage of c. jejuni  <dig> is integrated in a different region than in c. jejuni rm1221: it is located upstream to the invasion phenotypic protein . a vestigial mu-like phage integrated upstream of cipa is also present in the genome of c. jejuni m <dig> .

the human outbreak-associated isolate ihv <dig> underwent genome rearrangement
the human c. jejuni isolates ihv <dig> and ihv <dig> were sequenced using paired-end library, assembled and mapped against c. jejuni  <dig> 

the kpni pfge profile of the human isolate ihv <dig> differed from that of c. jejuni  <dig> and ihv <dig> by three bands  <cit> , which were interpreted to mean that the isolate was closely related to the outbreak strain  <cit> . however, the assembled contigs of ihv <dig> did not map unequivocally to the genome of c. jejuni  <dig>  on the contrary, all contigs of c. jejuni ihv <dig> mapped completely to the water isolate genome.

initial comparison between the outbreak isolates as well as other available genomes of c. jejuni strains belonging to the st- <dig> was performed using blastn with default parameters and an atlas was built using c. jejuni  <dig> as the reference genome . the more divergent genomic regions of all analysed st- <dig> complex genomes  included the los, flagella and capsule  loci, as well as cjie <dig> which was only present in the three outbreak isolates. as expected, the genomes of human isolates were highly similar to the reference genome of the water isolate. however, significant variation was detected within the cjie <dig> region between the isolates ihv <dig> and  <dig> figure  <dig>

c. jejuni  <dig> and ihv <dig> differ also from ihv <dig> by an insertion of approximately 6 kb downstream of cjie <dig>  located between trna-2-selenouride synthase  and ferrochetolase . a second copy of this locus occurs downstream the acyl-coa thioester hydrolase  and it is a homologue to the locus cj0967-cj <dig> of c. jejuni nctc  <dig>  the cj0967-cj <dig> locus downstream of cj0965c, as observed in ihv <dig>  is conserved among several c. jejuni strains including st- <dig>  by contrast, the second copy of this locus inserted between ybbb and hemh has been previously described only in c. jejuni 81– <dig>  <cit>  and blastn analysis showed that it is present also in c. jejuni m <dig> ,  <dig> and icdccj <dig> . as described for c. jejuni 81– <dig>  <cit> , both these loci in c. jejuni  <dig> harbour a ~200 bp specific region of intergenic at-rich dna, including an inverted repeat and a g-rich tract upstream the start codon of the cj <dig> homologue. in the c. jejuni isolate ihv <dig> the locus downstream of ybbb is substituted by a gene encoding an ammonium transporter showing  <dig> % nucleotide identity with the pseudogene cj <dig> in c. jejuni nctc  <dig> and high amino acid identity with several c. jejuni and c. coli ammonium transporters. this gene is not present in the genome of either c. jejuni  <dig> or ihv <dig> 

the analysis revealed that the human isolate ihv <dig> contained several genome rearrangements inside and immediately downstream the cjie <dig> element compared to the water isolate, and these were responsible for the observed differences in pfge profiles. these differences were verified by pcr, thus they were not a consequence of misassembly or sequencing error. however, based on these data it cannot be determined whether these alterations have evolved in ihv <dig> during the infection in the patient, or were already present in the population that caused the outbreak.

snp analysis and genealogy reconstruction suggest that c. jejuni <dig> and ihv <dig> are two different strains
to understand the microevolution of the waterborne outbreak-associated isolates, we analysed the polymorphic sites detected using progressivemauve aligner. the polymorphic sites were checked manually if they fulfilled our criteria and they were divided into isolated snps and cnps . snps are most likely caused by mutations, whereas cnps are probably the result of homologous recombination  <cit> . the human ihv <dig> strain showed only three snps compared with the water strain  <dig> . in contrast, even when excluding the previously recognized variable regions , the human strain ihv <dig> differed from c. jejuni  <dig> by  <dig> snps, which are spread across the chromosome . furthermore, ihv <dig> showed the presence of  <dig> cnps affecting a total of  <dig> genes .

only a few snps are expected to be produced during a single passage through the host, based on previous studies in a human patient  <cit>  and animal models  <cit> . the few differences observed between ihv <dig> and  <dig> can be a consequence of a single passage through the patient. by contrast, the much greater number of polymorphisms observed between ihv <dig> and  <dig> suggests that they were not generated during the outbreak.

to verify this hypothesis we attempted to reconstruct the genealogy of the three isolates. for this analysis we included the genomes of four additional st- <dig> c. jejuni strains isolated from chicken 12 years after the outbreak. the chicken isolates had a kpni pfge profile indistinguishable from c. jejuni  <dig>  or differentiated by two bands  . two chicken strains  were obtained from different houses of the same farm, while the other two strains were obtained from two different farms two weeks later. it is expected that in the time frame of 12 years the isolates would accumulate several snps by genetic drift, allowing us to estimate the distance between c. jejuni  <dig> and ihv <dig>  assuming that similar pfge patterns originated from a common ancestor. the genealogy reconstructed using clonalframe based on core genome alignment obtained with progressivemauve is presented in figure  <dig>  the tree shows a monophyletic relationship between c. jejuni  <dig>  the human isolate ihv <dig> and the chicken strains. the c. jejuni human isolate ihv <dig> is located in a separate branch that originates directly from the root. a blastn comparison of the genomes of c. jejuni  <dig> and the chicken strains revealed that they are very similar . differences between c. jejuni  <dig> and the chicken strains were located in the cjie <dig> , the los locus and the flagellar locus. to estimate the genetic distance between the chicken and the outbreak strains, we compared the allelic profiles of  <dig>  genes obtained from the pubmlst-campylobacter database. split decomposition  showed that the chicken strains are closer to c. jejuni  <dig> and the human isolate ihv <dig>  than ihv <dig> . we further calculated the number of snps present between c. jejuni  <dig> and the chicken strain 6236/ <dig> using the same criteria applied for the outbreak strains. in particular, we excluded all regions that could be affected by homologous recombination  in order to detect only those polymorphisms most likely acquired by mutation. from an original list of ~ <dig> polymorphisms extracted from progressive mauve alignment of c. jejuni  <dig> and 6236/ <dig>  only  <dig> snps fulfilled our criteria . in fact, the majority of the polymorphisms were located within the cjie <dig> or were classified as cnps, indicating that homologous recombination explained the accumulation of genetic differences between c. jejuni  <dig> and 6236/ <dig> 

these results suggest that the number of differences observed between c. jejuni  <dig> and ihv <dig> is too large for accumulation over the course of the outbreak. on the basis of the results, two hypotheses can be formulated: 1) the water was contaminated by a mixture of at least two related c. jejuni strains and 2) ihv <dig> is not associated with the outbreak. considering the findings of the epidemiological investigation  <cit> , the first hypothesis appears to be the most plausible.

recombination is the probable origin of the observed differences in cjie2
cjies are postulated to be hypervariable genomic regions that contribute to diversity of c. jejuni
 <cit> . in particular, cjie <dig>  has been shown to form a family of prophages with both conserved and divergent sequence regions, and appears to be adapted to c. jejuni
 <cit> . our analysis of three outbreak isolates showed that cjie <dig> is variable even between highly related c. jejuni strains . we extended the comparison to include cjie <dig> sequences of chicken strains of the same st- <dig>  two different cjie <dig> sequences were detected: 6236/ <dig> and 6237/ <dig> have an identical cjie <dig> sequence, whereas 6538/ <dig> possesses a cjie <dig> that differs from the cjie <dig> of 6236/ <dig> and 6237/ <dig> at three positions . comparing the chicken-associated cjie <dig> sequences with those of the outbreak strains, we observed that they are more related to cjie <dig> of c. jejuni ihv <dig> than to  <dig>  in spite of the ancestral relationship between the later and the chicken strains. this observation suggests that cjie <dig> undergoes extensive recombination and genetic rearrangement, comparable with that of the mu-like phage cjie <dig>  considering that the endonucleases encoded by these elements inhibit natural transformation of c. jejuni
 <cit> , their hypervariability might influence the microevolution of closely related c. jejuni strains.

CONCLUSIONS
outbreak strains are isolates that are both epidemiologically  and genetically related . such isolates are presumed to be clonal  <cit> . however, in waterborne outbreaks, several varieties of pathogens  or a mixture of strains are sometimes detected in the water as well as in human samples as a result of waste water contamination  <cit> . in such cases several different outbreak-associated strains may be detected  <cit> . in the waterborne outbreak re-investigated in this study, two human isolates were attributed to the water contamination, based on serotype and pfge data  <cit> . although one of the human isolates had a slightly deviant pfge pattern, this was not considered significant enough to exclude it from the outbreak, as a pfge profile can change after only a single passage through the chicken host  <cit> , by genomic rearrangement due to phage infection  <cit>  or mobilization of temperate phages  <cit> . the pfge pattern differences observed in ihv <dig> could potentially have occurred during the passage though the human host. however, our comparative genomic analysis clearly reveals that this human isolate contains so many genomic alterations compared to the water strain, that it represents another c. jejuni strain. in this particular case, whole genome analysis was required to correctly define the clonal frame. this study highlights the capability of whole-genome sequencing to unambiguously resolve the relationship between the isolates of a c. jejuni outbreak. in the future, next-generation sequencing technologies will more intensively be applied as a tool for outbreak strain characterization, remarkable improving the reliability of epidemiological conclusions on the association between source and infected patients.
