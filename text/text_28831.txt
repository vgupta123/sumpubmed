BACKGROUND
microbial contamination of pharmaceuticals has been an everlasting problem for researchers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers worldwide. it can result in the spoilage of the formula by breaking down active ingredients and excipients, affecting the potency, stability and efficacy of the drug  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of high numbers of pathogens poses a serious health threat to consumers, especially those who are already ill or in a weakened state . several cases of infection due to contaminated pharmaceuticals were reported in literature .

common pharmaceutical contaminants include bacteria, where contamination with gram-positive bacteria implicates human intervention as a major reason for product contamination, while the presence of gram-negative bacteria suggests lack of process control in pharmaceutical environments, especially involving water systems and raw materials  <cit> . gram-negative rods are considered the most commonly found bacterial isolates in non-sterile pharmaceuticals, regardless of geographical location or time  <cit> .

conventional standard microbiological methods are currently used for the routine testing of pharmaceutical products and identification of pharmaceutical bacterial contaminants, including conventional pharmacopoeial methods, as well as simplified, commercially available biochemical test kits, such as the api system  <cit> . recently, however, molecular technologies have positively affected the field of pharmaceutical microbiology, providing rapid quantitative as well as qualitative information on microorganisms present in a given pharmaceutical sample . the 16s rrna gene is most commonly used for taxonomic purposes  <cit> .

the objective of this study was to identify bacterial contaminants, isolated from different pharmaceuticals using conventional biochemical methods and the api identification system. bacterial isolates showing inconclusive or contradictory results were further subjected to polymerase chain reaction -based methods of identification using either universal or species-specific primer pairs.

moreover, this study aimed at comparing between standard biochemical methods and pcr-based assays in the detection of pharmacopoeial bacterial indicators in artificially-contaminated pharmaceutical samples with respect to time, cost and limit of detection.

methods
standard bacterial strains
the following standard strains were used: staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538p, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc  <dig>  bacillus subtilis atcc  <dig>  bacillus cereus atcc  <dig>  escherichia coli nctc  <dig>  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc  <dig>  salmonella enterica subspecies enterica atcc  <dig>  and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  <dig> 

tested pharmaceuticals
a total of  <dig> used pharmaceuticals  were tested for bacterial contamination. these included  <dig> pharmaceutical preparations,  <dig> cosmetic preparations,  <dig> raw materials and  <dig> herbal products.

isolation of contaminants
one gram  of the tested pharmaceutical were aseptically added to  <dig> ml of sterile tryptic soy broth  with or without plt  as a neutralizing agent  <cit>  and incubated at  <dig> °c for 24– <dig> h in a shaking incubator at  <dig> rpm. fifty microliters  aliquots of the overnight cultures were then streaked onto nutrient agar plates and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h.

identification of the bacterial isolates by biochemical tests
after gram-staining, the bacterial isolates were identified according to the “identification flow charts” of bergey’s manual of determinative bacteriology  <cit> .

the gram-positive cocci were streaked onto the surface of mannitol salt agar , and then identified by subjecting them to confirmatory tests specific for staphylococcus spp., including catalase test, tube coagulase test, dnase test, blood hemolysis, urease test and novobiocin sensitivity test. the tested isolates were further identified using the api staph kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sporulating, rod-shaped gram-positive isolates were subjected to spore staining to confirm the presence of bacillus spp. they were subsequently subjected to biochemical tests, namely starch hydrolysis , voges proskauer and catalase tests .

on the other hand, gram-negative isolates were respectively streaked onto the surface of both macconkey’s agar and cetrimide agar. oxidase-negative gram-negative isolates, growing only on macconkey’s agar  were further identified using various biochemical tests including indole production, methyl red, voges proskauer, citrate utilization, urease, oxidative/fermentative activity, motility tests as well as growth on triple sugar iron agar and xylose lysine desoxycholate agar  <cit> . further biochemical identification of gram-negative isolates was done using the api 20e kit .

pcr-based identification
identification using species-specific primer pairs
pcr-based identification of a specific bacterial species was carried out using a dna extraction protocol  <cit> , and the species-specific primer pairs were designed using the standard nucleotide basic local alignment search tool   <cit> . the adopted species-specific primer pairs and universal primer pairs are listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> pcr primers used in this study

six species-specific primer pairs for s. hominis, s. warneri  <cit> , s. epidermidis  <cit> , b. subtilis, b. cereus and b. anthracis  <cit>  were used for further identification of selected staphylococcal and bacillus isolates, respectively, by a simple uniplex pcr-based method. appropriate positive and negative controls were included to exclude false negative and false positive results  <cit> . the primers for s. epidermidis atcc  <dig>  s. warneri isolate , b. subtilis atcc  <dig> and b. cereus atcc  <dig> were used as the positive controls for their respective strains, whereas the 16s rrna universal primer pair was used as a positive control for s. hominis and b. anthracis. on the other hand, s. aureus atcc 6538p was used as the negative control for s. epidermidis,s. warneri and s. hominis. in addition, b. cereus atcc  <dig> was used as a negative control for b. subtilis while b. subtilis atcc  <dig> acted as a negative control for b. cereus and b. anthracis.

the protocol of amplification for all of the tested bacterial species was as follows:  <dig>  μl of 2× green pcr master mix ,  <dig> μl dna template ,  <dig>  μm of each primer, and  <dig>  μl pcr-grade water.

the pcr reactions were performed using a perkin elmer thermocycler , with an initial denaturation at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles at 95°c , tm- <dig>  and  <dig> °c  and a final extension at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min. the extension time during the  <dig> cycles was chosen based on the product size .

the amplified samples were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using 1– <dig>  % agarose gels  that had been prestained with ethidium bromide .

identification using 16s rrna universal primer pair
identification of selected bacterial isolates was done by pcr amplification of the16s rrna gene using universal primer pair  <cit> , followed by 16s rrna gene sequencing of the amplified pcr products. genomic bacterial dna isolation kit  was used to extract highly pure dna, which was used for downstream molecular experiments, including dna sequencing. each pcr reaction tube  contained the following:  <dig> μl of 2× green pcr master mix ,  <dig> μl dna extract ,  <dig>  μΜ of each primer, and  <dig> μl pcr-grade water. a negative control was prepared by replacing the dna template with sterile deionized water . the pcr reaction was performed with an initial denaturation at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles at  <dig> °c,  <dig>  °c and  <dig> °c for  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min, respectively and a final extension at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min. the final pcr product was purified by the company sigma for scientific services  prior to dna sequencing of the 16s rrna gene with the help of a bioneer automated sequencer , using forward and reverse 16s rrna universal primer pairs  <cit> .

sequence alignments and construction of phylogenetic trees
using the nucleotide basic local alignment search tool   <cit> , the nucleotide sequences were compared against the genbank database. the top twenty homology matched hits for each isolate, with the highest total score, were then used together with the isolate sequence to construct a phylogenetic tree using the blast program.

artificial contamination of a pharmaceutical sample
ten-gram samples of raw material glucose powder were added to  <dig> ml of tsb. after thorough dissolution, samples were inoculated separately with  <dig> ml of a 10− <dig> dilution of 24-h tsb cultures of either p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  e. coli nctc  <dig>  s. aureus atcc 6538p or s. enterica subsp. enterica atcc  <dig>  inoculated samples were placed in a shaking incubator for  <dig> h at  <dig> °c and  <dig> rpm.

standard methods for isolation and detection of bacterial contaminants
after incubation, the enriched tsb cultures were streaked on macconkey’s agar, msa, cetrimide agar and xylose-lysine-desoxycholate  agar plates. after incubation at  <dig> °c for 24– <dig> h, colonies were streaked onto sterile plates of trypticase soy agar  for isolation of pure cultures. tsa plates were incubated for 18– <dig> h and cells from pure cultures were gram-stained and then subjected to biochemical identification tests. additionally, api 20e and api staph kits were used for further biochemical identification.

dna extraction from artificially-contaminated samples
three ml-aliquots of the artificially-contaminated samples were centrifuged for  <dig> min at  <dig> rpm. the pellet was washed twice in  <dig> ml of sterile diw, then resuspended in  <dig> ml of sterile diw and boiled for 10– <dig> min followed by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was used as a source of dna for the pcr reaction.

pcr detection of bacterial contaminants
for each sample,  <dig> μl of the dna lysate  were transferred into a pcr tube containing  <dig>  μl 2× green pcr master mix ,  <dig>  μm of each primer , and  <dig>  μl pcr-grade water. the simple uniplex pcr reaction conditions were optimized for the different species-specific primer pairs for each bacterial contaminant , so that they could be used in a single pcr run with an initial denaturation at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles at  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c for  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min and  <dig>  min, respectively, and a final extension at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min.

determination of minimum detection limit  for both methods under investigation
the mdl of each method was determined by using standard e. coli nctc  <dig> as a representative of bacterial contaminants. the pharmaceutical product used was  <dig> % glucose solution prepared aseptically by adding  <dig> gm glucose powder to  <dig> ml sterile distilled water.

a tsb culture of e. coli nctc  <dig> was diluted in  <dig>  % sterile saline to prepare a series of 10-fold dilutions. the  <dig> % glucose solutions were separately inoculated with the above mentioned dilutions to contain about  <dig> -  <dig> cfu/ml for each of the tested methods. to determine the mdl for conventional biochemical methods; a loopful of each inoculated sample was streaked onto selective media  as well as tsa plates. the mdl was estimated based on the least inoculum  showing growth on agar plates.

to determine the mdl for pcr-based methods, the following was done: 1ml of each inoculated sample was centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in  <dig> μl sterile diw which was then transferred into a pcr tube that was then heated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min to extract dna. the remaining pcr components were then added to the pcr tube:  <dig>  μl of 2× green pcr master mix ,  <dig>  μm of each primer, and  <dig>  μl pcr-grade water.

using the species-specific primer pair for e. coli  <cit> , the reaction was performed with an initial denaturation at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles at 95°c,  <dig> °c and 72°c for  <dig>  min each, and a final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> pre-used pharmaceuticals  were collected and examined for the eventual presence of bacterial contaminants. the samples were collected from different available classes of preparations including syrups, elixirs, drops , powders, teabags and cosmetics. in total,  <dig> bacterial contaminants were successfully isolated from  <dig> of the tested pharmaceuticals, i.e., bacterial contaminants were found in  <dig> % of the tested products. these contaminants were distributed as follows:  <dig> from  <dig> pharmaceutical preparations,  <dig> from  <dig> raw materials,  <dig> from  <dig> cosmetic preparations and  <dig> from  <dig> herbal products. gram-positive bacteria were more prevalent than gram-negative bacteria in the tested products, where they constituted  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and 100%  of the detected contaminants in pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetic preparations and raw materials, respectively. on the other hand,  <dig> out of the  <dig> contaminants in herbal products were gram-negative bacteria.

following their isolation, the bacterial contaminants were subjected to biochemical identification, using conventional tests as well as api identification systems. selected isolates, which showed inconclusive or contradictory results, were further identified using pcr-based methods.

biochemical identification of the bacterial isolates
among the isolated contaminants,  <dig> isolates were gram-positive , whereas the remaining  <dig> isolates were thin short gram-negative rods .

based on the biochemical identification results of the  <dig> gram-positive cocci , six isolates were accurately identified by both conventional methods and the api staph system. on the other hand, the remaining  <dig> isolates and the gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped isolate 24b were not conclusively identified, and were thus further subjected to pcr-based methods to achieve proper identification.table  <dig> identification of gram-positive cocci using conventional biochemical methods and api staph kit

molecular identification using pcr-based methods
species-specific primer pairs were used whenever the results of the conventional and the api methods were contradictory, or when further identification to the species level was required. this pertained to  <dig> staphylococcal isolates , as well as all of the bacillus isolates. two of the former isolates  showed a pcr product at the specified band size   and were thus identified as s. epidermidis. the results of the pcr-based identification of these  <dig> isolates were in agreement with those of conventional biochemical tests, while they contradicted those of the api staph kit.fig.  <dig> pcr amplification of specific gene fragment  in s. epidermidis. lane m:  <dig> bp plus dna ladder*; lane 2: isolate 20a; lane 3: isolate 52; lane 4: positive control ; lane 5: negative control . * dna ladder yields  <dig> fragments of the following sizes :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 100



the remaining  <dig> staphylococci  were not definitively identified by biochemical methods , though the api staph kit results were more useful in guiding us towards choosing the specific primers  used in the pcr-based identification. the  <dig> isolates were identified as s. warneri, since they showed a pcr product at the expected band size  upon using the respective species-specific primer pair .

for further identification of all of the  <dig> bacillus isolates, three species-specific primer pairs were used, each was respectively specific to one of the  <dig> most pathogenic bacillus spp.; b. anthracis, b. subtilis and b. cereus. none of the bacillus isolates was identified as b. anthracis, while twelve isolates yielded a pcr product at the specified band size  after pcr amplification using a b. subtilis-specific primer pair . it is worth mentioning that, although isolate 8b failed to hydrolyse starch when grown on starch agar and isolate  <dig> showed a negative voges proskauer test, they were both still identified as b. subtilis using the respective species-specific primer pair. moreover, only one bacillus isolate  turned out to be b. cereus, since it showed a pcr product at  <dig> bp upon using the respective species-specific primer pair . as for the remaining three bacillus isolates, none of them showed a pcr product with any of the three used primer pairs. consequently, the latter isolates could not be identified by the applied pcr-based method.

the presence of three gram-negative isolates showing contradictory results between both conventional tests and api 20e kit at the genus level  necessitated the use of a pcr-based method using enterobacter-specific and klebsiella-specific primer pairs. however, this was found to be inapplicable, since the two genera share very close genotypic characteristics  <cit> , which was confirmed by checking the specificity of the respective genus-specific primer pairs published in the literature  and using the blast program  <cit> .

on the other hand, the use of the 16s rrna universal primer pair, followed by gene sequencing, was used whenever biochemical identification results were inconclusive. this applied to;  two staphylococcal isolates ,  the gram-positive non-spore-forming rod-shaped isolate 24b, and  three gram-negative isolates . their identification was achieved by pcr amplification of the conserved 16s rrna gene  using a universal primer pair, followed by dna sequencing of the amplified 16s rrna gene and construction of phylogenetic trees using the blast program. only three figures representing the three groups mentioned above are shown here .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree for the gram-positive isolate 16b

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree for the gram-positive isolate 24b

fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree for the gram-negative isolate 55a



the gram-positive isolate 16b was found to bear similarity to s. saprophyticus subsp. bovis . this finding coincides with that of the api staph kit, although the latter’s results were considered “invalid” .

using phylogenetic analysis , the gram-positive isolate  <dig> was found to be closely related to s. warneri. since most of s. warneri strains are known to be mannitol-fermentors  <cit> , while this isolate was found to be both mannitol non-fermenting and novobiocin-sensitive, it was incorrectly identified by conventional biochemical methods as s. epidermidis. on the other hand, results of the api staph for the same isolate showed an invalid identification giving a %id of  <dig> % and  <dig>  % for s. hominis and s. warneri, respectively . therefore, the molecular identification results of the s. warneri isolate  <dig> somewhat agreed with those of api staph kit; however, they contradicted those of conventional biochemical tests.

as for the gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped isolate 24b, it was found to be closely related to microbacterium paraoxydans by phylogenetic analysis . the identity of this isolate, which did not grow on mannitol salt agar nor macconkey’s agar, could not be determined using the conventional biochemical tests.

regarding gram-negative isolates, the phylogenetic tree of isolate 11b  revealed a close relationship to pectobacterium cypripedii. the genus pectobacterium, which includes gram-negative non-lactose-fermentors, is closely related to the genus erwinia  <cit> . the molecular identification result is therefore close to that of conventional biochemical tests, which identified this isolate as erwinia cacticida. on the other hand, the api 20e kit identified the same isolate, though to a low discrimination level, as buttiauxella agrestis . this result confirms the fact that the api 20e kit does not consider lactose fermentation in the differentiation between members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

the phylogenetic relationship between the gram-negative isolate 55a and pantoea agglomerans is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  this result was in accordance with that of the api 20e kit that identified this isolate as pantoea spp. , but with a low level of discrimination. while k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae  came in second place in the api kit identification, it did not even appear in the phylogenetic tree of the isolate.

finally, the gram-negative isolate 82a was found to be closely related to p. stutzeri lmg 11199t , which, in turn, is in accordance with conventional biochemical tests, where it was identified as pseudomonas spp. other than p. aeruginosa . it is noteworthy that this isolate was not conclusively identified by the api 20e system where it was merely described as a non-fermentor species with %id =  <dig> ,and a low discrimination level.

artificial contamination of pharmaceutical samples
biochemical methods for detecting bacterial contaminants in the pharmaceutical samples involved streaking onto selective/differential agar media for isolation of the target microorganisms. representative well-isolated bacterial colonies were then transferred to tsa plates for further morphological and biochemical confirmatory identification tests. the standard strains s. aureus atcc 6538p and e. coli nctc  <dig> were subjected to biochemical analysis using the api identification system. s. aureus was misidentified as s. xylosus with a good identification level, probably due to the fact that the api staph kit does not include the coagulase test. on the other hand, e. coli was correctly identified using the api 20e kit, with a very good identification level.

in our study, dna extraction was achieved by boiling, as suggested by jimenez et al.  <cit> , since that method was found to be effective for all of the tested bacterial contaminants. the specificity of the different previously reported dna primer pairs used was confirmed using a blast search  <cit> , available through the website of the national centre for biotechnology information .

the working concentration of the primer pairs specific to p. aeruginosa, e. coli and s. aureus used in pcr was  <dig> picomoles/μl. however, the s. enterica-specific primer pair was used at a higher concentration , in order to show a pcr product.

all of the tested bacterial contaminants were successfully detected in their respective glucose samples by pcr amplification of respective characteristic dna fragments using species-specific primer pairs . it should be noted that the pcr product of s. enterica was more intense when using the primer pair at a higher concentration ; however, a strong primer dimer band was detected.fig.  <dig> pcr amplification of specific gene fragments in selected strains. pcr amplification products of the oprl gene fragment  in p. aeruginosa atcc  <dig> ; uida gene fragment  in e. coli nctc  <dig> ; nuca gene fragment  in s. aureus atcc 6538p  and inva gene fragment  in sal. enterica atcc  <dig> using  <dig> picomoles/μl and  <dig> picomoles/μl species-specific primer pair, respectively. lane m shows  <dig> bp plus dna ladder of fragments sizes :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 100



a period of 5– <dig> days was required for the bacteria to be isolated, purified, and identified by biochemical methods. on the other hand, the time needed to complete the pcr assay, including both sample preparation and pcr amplification of the specific dna bacterial targets, was only 29– <dig> h.

the calculated cost of each method included all the steps required to achieve final identification of the selected bacterial contaminants. however, it should be noted that the cost of equipment required for each method was not included. it was found that the cost of culture media, reagents and kits required for the identification of the selected bacterial contaminants by biochemical methods in  <dig> samples mount to about  <dig> egyptian pounds . on the other hand, the cost of the reagents and chemicals required for the pcr-based assay was about  <dig>  l.e. for all  <dig> samples. although the individual reagents for the pcr assay are relatively more expensive, they are much less in number.

we then estimated the mdl for each identification method under investigation by inoculating  <dig> % glucose solutions with different inocula  of the standard e. coli nctc  <dig>  on one hand, the inoculated glucose samples were streaked onto selective agar media as well as tsa plates to determine the least inoculum exhibiting growth. on the other hand, the minimum inoculum showing a detectable pcr band of the specified size on agarose gel was determined by pelleting  <dig> ml of each inoculated glucose sample and using the pellet as a source of dna , in order to exclude the effect of the dna extraction step on the determination of the mdl of the pcr-based method.

we found that the mdl of e. coli using the pcr assay  was lower than that observed when using conventional methods .

discussion
microbial contamination of pharmaceuticals may arise during manufacturing, storage or use by the consumer, and can ultimately result in several undesirable consequences. in egypt, microbiological labs follow the usp and bp recommendations for testing the presence/load of microbial contaminants in non-sterile dosage forms and dietary supplements.

in the present study, different biochemical  and molecular  methods were used for the identification of a number of bacterial contaminants isolated from various types of pharmaceuticals . both of these methods were then compared with regard to the recovery and identification of selected bacterial contaminants.

the bacterial contaminants were isolated from  <dig> out of  <dig> pre-used pharmaceutical products tested . similarly, it was reported earlier that 50% of the nonsterile pharmaceuticals products tested were heavily contaminated  <cit> . on the other hand, campana et al.  <cit>  reported much lower contamination of the tested cosmetic products . pre-used products were chosen for this study, in order to increase the probability of finding contaminants. contaminants isolated from pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics and raw materials were mostly gram-positive , while those isolated from herbal products were mostly gram-negative . in agreement with this latter finding, abba et al. reported that  <dig>  % of herbal remedies tested were contaminated with s. typhi,  <dig>  % with shigella spp. and  <dig>  % with e. coli  <cit> . the observed contamination of herbal tea bags in this study with gram-negative bacteria could be due to any of the following reasons:  unsuitable preparation methods;  contaminated materials and equipment; and/or  improper handling of raw materials by infected personnel during processing. in order for herbal preparations to maintain best quality, safety and efficacy, manufacturing companies must ensure the highest level of hygiene during manufacturing, in order to ensure the lowest possible level of pathogenic organisms in their final herbal products. on the other hand, incidents of microbial contamination of cosmetics are widely reported . this could be attributed to inadequate preservation of cosmetics or the use of expired products by the public, which in turn can lead to microbial contamination that favors growth and proliferation of skin pathogens upon use  <cit> . in  <dig>  hugbo and colleagues reported that microbial contamination was detected in some brands of cosmetic creams, where the most common bacterial contaminants found were staphylococcus spp. and bacillus spp., a finding which is similar to ours in the current study  <cit> . on the other hand, a recent study conducted on non-sterile oral dosage forms found that contaminants were mostly gram-negative enterobacteria  <cit> .

compared to cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations, raw materials showed a higher percentage of contamination , probably due to the lack of effective chemical preservation, where  <dig> % of the contaminants where gram-positive bacteria. our results are in agreement with those of de clerck et al. who reported that the majority of contaminants isolated from gelatin extracts belonged to members of the genus bacillus  <cit> .

in the current study,  <dig> % of the contaminants were identified as bacillus spp., the majority of which were isolated from non-sterile dosage forms. similarly, in a recent study from the year  <dig>  mugoyela and mwambete  <cit>  reported that the majority of microbial contaminants isolated from non-sterile pharmaceuticals were bacillus spp.,

since only  <dig>  % of the isolated contaminants  were conclusively identified using both conventional methods and the api staph/api 20e system, molecular identification was deemed necessary for the remaining contaminants. in addition, further identification of bacillus contaminants to their exact species was not feasible by conventional biochemical tests, since members of the genus bacillus exhibit a wide range of physiologic versatility, allowing them to live in almost every natural environment  <cit> . they therefore required further identification using pcr-based methods using species-specific primer pairs. similar to conventional biochemical test results, isolates 20a and  <dig> showed a pcr product at the corresponding band size , and were thus identified as s. epidermidis. it should be noted that isolate 20a was mistakenly identified as s. auricularis using the api staph kit. although s. auricularis is biochemically similar to s. epidermidis, the former is urease-negative  <cit> . this observed contradiction in the biochemical identification results of isolate 20a most probably arose due to the fact that it gave a positive urease test using the conventional method, whereas it was reported as urease-negative using the api staph kit. s. chromogenes also has a similar biochemical profile to s. epidermidis; however, isolate  <dig> was not identified as s. chromogenes, since the latter produces yellow-pigmented colonies upon culturing on nutrient agar  <cit> , unlike isolate  <dig> 

some identification schemes do not account for phenotypic variations among strains belonging to the same species. for instance, s. saprophyticus is listed in several identification schemes as mannitol non-fermenting, although in our study, one mannitol-fermentor, isolate 16b, was conclusively identified as s. saprophyticus by phylogenetic analysis. on the other hand, most of s. warneri strains are known to be mannitol-fermentors  <cit> . this fact resulted in the erroneous identification of the s. warneri isolate  <dig>  a mannitol non-fermentor, novobiocin-sensitive and urease-positive staphylococcal isolate, as s. epidermidis by conventional biochemical methods. nevertheless, all five s. epidermidis isolates  were conclusively identified as such by conventional biochemical tests, based on their mannitol non-fermenting, coagulase- and dnase-negative, novobiocin-sensitive and urease-positive characteristics.

in this study, both biochemical and pcr-based methods were used to detect bacterial indicators in artificially-contaminated pharmaceutical grade glucose powder, for the purpose of comparing both identification methods with respect to time and cost. optimization of the pcr reaction conditions for the different primer pairs  was done in the pcr-based identification method, in an attempt to save time. . the pcr reaction conditions optimized in other similar studies  <cit>  differed, probably depending on the primer pairs used and the size of the amplicons produced besides the type of dna polymerase used for amplification.

the relatively long time required by biochemical methods of identification was similar to other studies  <cit> . we therefore concluded that the standard usp procedure  <cit> , which relies primarily on biochemical methods for the identification of bacterial indicators, was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. it also requires multiple steps for the growth and isolation of pure bacterial cultures prior to their identification, resulting in delaying the release of raw materials/pharmaceutical products. on the other hand, the relatively short time necessary to conduct a pcr assay was in accordance with previous studies  <cit> . on estimating the mdl for each identification method, the mdl of e. coli using the pcr assay was lower than that observed using conventional methods. similarly, jimenez et al.  <cit>  calculated a mdl of  <dig> cfu/ml for salmonella spp. by a pcr-based method, while a year later, a higher mdl  for e. coli, p. aeruginosa and s. aureus was reported  <cit> . conversely, samadi et al.  <cit>  reported a much lower mdl of  <dig> cfu/ml. more recently, farajnia et al.  <cit>  were able to detect microbial contamination at a level of less than  <dig> cfu/ml or gram of a product, using a multiplex pcr assay. none of the latter studies calculated an mdl for conventional tests.

CONCLUSIONS
pcr-based methods provided an earlier, more cost-effective and more sensitive detection and identification of bacterial contamination, compared to standard biochemical methods currently applied in the pharmaceutical industry. this would allow for rapid implementation of corrective actions, thereby minimizing manufacturing losses and speeding up product release.
