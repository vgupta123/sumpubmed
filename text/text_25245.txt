BACKGROUND
the cell cycle is the sequence of events by which a growing cell replicates all of its components and divides them into two daughter cells  <cit> . proliferating cells are repeating this sequence therefore the process is periodic. the eukaryotic cell division cycle is driven by an underlying molecular network which centers around complexes of cyclin-dependent kinases  and cyclins  <cit> . in proliferating cells the cell cycle engine is in periodic motion which suggested to many theoreticians that it is driven by a limit cycle oscillator  <cit> . in our view the cell cycle engine can show limit cycle behavior but only under special developmental contexts like early development  <cit> . in contrast, the cell cycle of growing cells is controlled by checkpoint mechanisms that generate stable steady states  <cit> . as a consequence, the cell cycle progression of growing cells can be viewed as irreversible transitions among stable states  <cit> . the driving force for these transitions is provided by the growth of cytoplasm and at the end of the cycle the cell divides and the control system settles in a steady state where it was starting from. in this paper we try to illustrate this point by using one of the models for the budding yeast cell cycle  <cit> . the "chen model"  <cit>  is defined by a 13-variable set of ordinary differential equations  and by  <dig> kinetic parameters. the kinetic equations describe the dynamics of the core cell cycle regulatory components: different cdk/cyclin complexes that drive bud formation, dna replication and mitosis  <cit> ; the regulators of cyclin degradation  and synthesis  and a cdk inhibitor . there are several positive and negative feedback loops among cell cycle control components in the model . both cln <dig> and clb <dig> cyclin synthesis are characterized by transcriptional positive feedback loops because the corresponding cdk/cyclin complexes  activate their own transcription factor   <cit> . another positive  feedback is between clb2/cdc <dig> kinase and its g <dig> enemies : they inactivate or promote the degradation of each others  <cit> . all the positive feedbacks in the mechanism are counteracted by negative feedback loops . cdc28/cln <dig> besides activating its transcription factor  which is a positive feedback, initiates a sequence of events that inhibits sbf: cln <dig> -|  -| clb <dig> -| sbf which is a time delayed negative feedback loop. similarly, clb <dig> kinase which is activated by a transcriptional positive feedback  <cit> , activates cdc <dig> that promotes clb <dig> degradation . the double-negative feedback is also regulated by a negative feedback, because clb <dig> activates sic <dig> and cdh <dig> via cdc20: clb <dig> → cdc <dig> →  -| clb <dig> 

a series of mathematical and computational methods have been developed for the analysis of complex reaction kinetic models . some of these tools are applied here to the chen's budding yeast cell cycle model in order to illustrate that the growing cell undergoes a series of irreversible transitions among cell cycle states.

RESULTS
excitation and relaxation periods during the budding yeast cell cycle
the extension of linear stability analysis to non-stationary systems tells us whether the trajectories of perturbed and unperturbed systems are converging or diverging in time . this analysis must be done all over the trajectory of the unperturbed system, because the reference point is changing in non-stationary systems  <cit> . if the real parts of all the eigenvalues of the linearized system are negative then the distance between the original and the perturbed systems are decreasing. if the real part of at least one of the eigenvalues is positive, then the distance between the original and the perturbed point is increasing in time. in chemical systems a positive real part eigenvalue is a sign for an autocatalytic regime when the system is in an excitation phase. in contrast when all the real part of eigenvalues are negative the system is in a relaxation period approaching to a stable steady state  <cit>  indicating that the perturbed system approaches the unperturbed one. the imaginary part of an eigenvalue is also informative, because it determines the way  how the perturbed and the original trajectories are converging to or diverging from each other. since we were not interested in these local characteristics of the trajectories, we have analyzed the real parts of the eigenvalues only. therefore, in the following text term eigenvalue always refers to the real part of the complex eigenvalue.

the eigenvalues of the jacobian for the chen  <cit>  model was calculated during the simulation of the budding yeast cell cycle . there are four periods  during the cycle  where at least one of the eigenvalues is positive which indicates an excitation in the underlying cell cycle control system. excitation periods e4a and e4b are very close to each other at the end of the cycle and they are well distinguishable only on the small inlet . in the middle of excitation period e <dig> another eigenvalue of the jacobian becomes positive, which is indicated by dark grey shading . each excitation period is followed by a relaxation period  where all the eigenvalues are negative.

at the beginning of the cell cycle all the eigenvalues are negative and the control system is in a stable state which is called g <dig> phase of the cell cycle . in this cell cycle phase all the major cyclins  are absent, but the level of g <dig> stabilizers  is high . although g <dig> is a stable state in the model, it is not a unique steady state, because the cell is growing in its cytoplasmic mass, which causes a slow but steady accumulation of cdk/cyclin activities. this is reflected in the slow decrease of sic <dig> level during relaxation period r <dig>  because sic <dig> gets degraded due to cdk dependent phosphorylation  <cit> .

just before  <dig> mins the stable g <dig> state looses its stability and the control system enters into excitation period e <dig> . the positive eigenvalue of the jacobian is the consequence of the transcriptional positive feedback loop between sbf and cdk/cyclin activities  <cit> . during this excitation period sbf jumps from very low value to one, which causes an increase in the rate of cln <dig> and clb <dig> synthesis . because of this positive feedback loop the cell cycle control system leaves the stable g <dig> state during excitation period e <dig> in an irreversible manner. all of these characteristics of excitation period e <dig> leads us to associate it with start transition of the cell cycle .

excitation period e <dig> is followed by a relaxation period  when the system approaches a new stable state, which is qualitatively different from g <dig>  since sbf is high which activates the synthesis of cln <dig> and clb <dig> cyclins, the level of cln2/cdc <dig> and clb5/cdc <dig> complexes is increasing. both of these cdk/cyclin complexes down-regulate the g <dig> stabilizers   <cit> , therefore sic <dig> and active cdh <dig> levels are decreasing during this relaxation period . the activity of cln2/cdc <dig> appears first which is responsible for initiation of bud formation. since clb5/cdc <dig> is inhibited by sic <dig> <cit> , its activity appears and triggers dna replication only after sic <dig> has dropped to very low value . the two cell cycle events during relaxation period r <dig> are initiation of bud formation and dna replication, which are coincident during budding yeast cell cycle  <cit> . therefore, we associate the state corresponding to relaxation period r <dig> with high sbf, cln <dig>  clb <dig> and low cdh <dig>  sic <dig> levels with s phase of the cell cycle .

relaxation period r <dig> is very short  because the system soon enters into a new excitation period . since both cdh <dig> and sic <dig> are negative regulators of cdc28/clb <dig> kinase, the decrease of sic <dig> and active cdh <dig> levels help to activate the transcriptional positive feedback loop between clb2/cdc <dig> and mcm <dig>  <cit> . it is true again that the transcription factor  for cyclin synthesis changes faster than the corresponding cyclin  level. by entering into the second excitation period the control system shoots for states where sbf, cln <dig>  clb <dig>  mcm <dig> and clb <dig> levels are high, while sic <dig> and active cdh <dig> levels are low. therefore we associate excitation period e <dig> with the irreversible decision to enter into mitosis. this excitation period interrupts relaxation period r <dig>  which reflects the fact that budding yeast cells enter into mitosis during s phase and they do not have a real g <dig> phase between s and m phases  <cit> .

there is a narrow excitation period  in the middle of the second excitation period, which is caused by turning off the sbf-cln <dig> transcriptional positive feedback loop  <cit> . this positive feedback was turned on during excitation period e <dig> at start transition. however, high cdc28/cln <dig> kinase activity – besides activating sbf  – also initiates a time delayed negative feedback loop: cdc28/cln <dig> down-regulates sic <dig> and cdh <dig>  which help cdc28/clb <dig> activation which inhibits the transcription factor for cln <dig> . when the rising cdc28/clb <dig> level during excitation period e <dig> crosses the inhibitory threshold, sbf turns off abruptly. turning off sbf causes decrease in both cln <dig> and clb <dig> levels after excitation period e <dig> . since cln <dig> kinase is responsible for polarized growth driving bud formation  <cit> , this excitation changes the growth characteristic of the cell  <cit> . the polarized growth started at e <dig> by cdc28/cln <dig> switches to isotropic growth resulting in bud expansion in all directions .

excitation period e <dig> changes the characteristics of the mitotic state induced by the control system during excitation period e <dig>  in period r <dig> the system relaxes to a state where clb <dig> and mcm <dig> levels are high, while sbf, cln <dig> and clb <dig> levels are low . the excitations  drives the cells out of the mitotic state when the spindle checkpoint is released  <cit> . this signal stimulates cdc <dig> activation that induces clb <dig> degradation  <cit> . the drop in clb <dig> level causes a decrease in cdc28/clb <dig> activity, which gets further amplified by turning off the positive feedback loop between cdc28/clb <dig> and mcm <dig>  reduction of cdc28/clb <dig> kinase activity also turns the double negative feedback loop between cdc28/clb <dig> and cdh <dig> to the g <dig> regulators side. activation of cdh <dig> causes further clb <dig> degradation and an irreversible exit from mitosis. the stoichiometric cdk inhibitor  also gets up-regulated in an autocatalytic manner but only after some delay and it is responsible for excitation e4b. the two excitations  drive the system to a g <dig> state with low clb <dig> level .

cell cycle transitions shifted in cell cycle mutants
the cell cycle transitions described in the previous section for wild type cells are shifted in certain cell cycle mutants. the analysis of eigenvalues during simulations when the level of certain cell cycle regulators were changed helped us to understand the role of feedback loops in irreversible cell cycle transitions.

the sbf-cln <dig> transcriptional positive feedback loop can be cancelled out by reducing sbf inhibition  to zero. this parameter change corresponds to the deletion of sbf inhibitory component, whi <dig>  which is a viable cell  <cit> . both e <dig> and e <dig> excitations are abolished  supporting that these excitations are the consequences of turning on and off the sbf-cdc28/cln <dig> positive feedback loop. the cdc28/clb2-mcm <dig> transcriptional positive feedback can be eliminated by constitutive clb <dig> expression which simulates a gal-clb <dig> strain, which is a viable cell  <cit> . ectopic clb <dig> expression eliminates excitations e <dig> and one of e <dig>  indicating that synthesis of mitotic cyclin  is turned on and off at these excitation periods . the prediction is that in the combined double mutant, whi5Δ gal-clb <dig>  four excitations should disappear, leaving one excitation period at mitotic exit intact. in contrast to our expectations, we found two excitation periods in the double mutant . simulations revealed that the first excitation period marks the g1/s transition where cdh <dig> and sic <dig> are turned off or degraded by appearing clb <dig> kinase activity . this antagonism between cdc28/clb <dig> and cdh <dig>  sic <dig> does not produce a positive eigenvalue in wild-type cells because cdh <dig> and sic <dig> are inactivated by cln <dig> and clb <dig> before clb <dig> cyclin appears  <cit> . the situation is different in this double mutant, which cycles at a reduced cell size because of the elevated clb <dig> synthesis. although sbf is fully active, cln <dig> level is small and roughly constant because the rate of synthesis is cell size dependent. as a consequence, in the double mutant it is cdc28/clb <dig> which turns off cdh <dig> and eliminates sic <dig> giving rise for a new excitation not observable in wild type.

in the absence of cln <dig>  start  is delayed compared to wild type cells , because the transcriptional positive feedback loop responsible for start is compromised. this delay in start is fully compensated and start is even advanced in a cln2Δ sic1Δ background . elimination of sic <dig> helps cdc28/clb <dig> to activate the transcriptional positive feedback. observe that sic <dig> deletion on its own does not have an effect on the cell cycle position of start .

dimension of the manifold
the dimension of the manifold of a dynamical system identifies how many variables are changing independently of the others at a certain time. figure  <dig> shows the change of the dimension of the manifold during a cycle. the dimension was estimated using the theory described in methods using threshold value zthres =  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the dimension of the manifold changes between one and seven during the cycle. the dimension usually increases in each excitation period, where one of the eigenvalues becomes positive. during excitation period e <dig> the dimension increases to  <dig> and then gradually decreases to 1; in excitation period e <dig> the dimension increases from  <dig> to  <dig>  and there is a further a rise in dimension  at the time of entry into mitosis, which is associated with e <dig> . the general picture is that the dimension of the manifold increases in excitation periods and then decreases in the subsequent relaxation periods. however, the dimension of the manifold never drops to zero during relaxation periods but rather to one. the minimum dimension is one because cell mass continuously increases during the cycle. therefore, the cell cycle control system never reaches a real steady state during the cell cycle, but it is rather pulled by increasing cell mass. the fact that the model has a maximal dynamical dimension of  <dig> does not mean that an explicit 7-variable equivalent model could be constructed. it rather suggests that a locally valid model can be constructed with no more than  <dig> variables at any time point.

discussion
dynamical models for natural phenomena are usually studied by computer simulations using numerical methods. the temporal patterns provided by this approach are often directly comparable to experimental data, which is a real advantage. however, computer simulations do not provide the modeler with any inside view why the mechanism works in a particular way. this disadvantage can be eliminated by using other tools of dynamical systems theory like bifurcation analysis. bifurcation analysis provides us with recurrent solutions  of the control system, which could be stable or unstable. the number, the nature  and the stability of recurrent solutions are dependent on parameter values. a change in the number or the characteristic of recurrent solutions is called bifurcations. both methods  have been extensively used for analysis of cell cycle models. cytoplasmic mass has an influence on the cell cycle progression, but its change is much slower than the molecular changes in the control system. therefore cellular mass is often considered as a bifurcation parameter  <cit>  which helps us to identify cell cycle states and cell cycle transitions dependent on cellular mass. however, those cell cycle transitions that are not dependent on reaching a critical cellular mass cannot be identified by bifurcation analysis.

we have tried to overcome this problem by applying a new method which has not been used for analyzing models of biological systems before. the time scale analysis applied here is a frequently applied tool for the investigation of complex chemical reaction networks . this approach is applicable for any models which are represented by ordinary differential equations. based on the sign of jacobian's eigenvalues the temporal evolution of the system can be divided into excitation and relaxation periods. in addition, considering the eigenvectors of the jacobian, the dynamical dimension of the system can also be calculated. during relaxation periods all the eigenvalues are negative and system approaches to a stable steady state. in contrast during excitation periods at least one of the eigenvalues is positive which leads to a deviation from a stable state. by applying time scale analysis to the chen's cell cycle model  <cit>  we have identified four excitation and four relaxation periods during the budding yeast cell cycle. the relaxation periods correspond to well known cell cycle phases like g <dig>  s and m phases. the excitations represent the irreversible cell cycle transitions driven by activation or inactivation of positive feedback and double-negative feedback loops. the first excitation period at start transition flips the control system from a g <dig> state into s phase with a concomitant initiation of bud growth. the second excitation is responsible for the initiation of mitosis, which is premature in budding yeast. the third excitation changes the morphology of bud growth from polarized to isotropic. finally the last excitation at mitotic exit pushes the system back to g <dig> phase. by analyzing cell cycle mutants we could determine which feedback loop is responsible for a certain excitation and cell cycle transition.

dimension analysis revealed that the dynamical dimension of the system never exceeds seven. this finding suggests that the 13-dimensional chen's model can be reduced to a seven dimension system at any given time point. the maximal dimension was always reached during the excitation periods and the dimension was reduced during the subsequent relaxation periods always to one. dynamical dimension one indicates that all chemical reactions are in stationary state, and the change of the system is dictated by the increase of cell mass only.

although limit cycle oscillators can be constructed without excitation  mechanisms, most examples for limit cycles are characterized by excitation-relaxation periods. in general, the dynamical dimension can be high during the whole cycle. a special category of limit cycles is based on sequential destabilization of attracting stationary points. this is the case in the chen model, where during the relaxation periods the dimension always decreases to one. if the dimension is one, all chemical concentrations are in steady state, which is moving due to the increase of the cell mass only. comparison of figures  <dig> and  <dig> clearly indicates that the chen model can be interpreted as switching between steady states.

CONCLUSIONS
we applied mathematical tools, which have been used to investigate complex chemical reaction models before, for the analysis of a biological regulatory network. the analysis of a budding yeast cell cycle model revealed the presence of autocatalytic excitation and subsequent relaxation periods in the cell cycle and these excitation periods can be connected to major cell cycle transitions. we propose that this technique can be very useful to detect the timing and length of dynamical transitions in any mathematical model of complex regulatory biological networks.
