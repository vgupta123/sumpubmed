BACKGROUND
transcriptional activator-like  effectors of xanthomonas spp. had been featured as central determinants of both bacterial pathogenicity and avirulence in numerous plant species or cultivars
 <cit> . however, it was not until recently that the biochemical function of tal effectors as transcriptional regulators was discovered
 <cit> .

the tridimensional structure of tal effectors showed that these proteins are distinct from any other bacterial effectors that are targeted to the interior of the host cell by the type-iii secretion system
 <cit> . tal effectors striking signature is made by the polymorphisms in positions 12-13th of the 33- <dig> amino acids tandem repeats, referred as repeat-variable diresidues , which comprise the dna-binding domain of the effector
 <cit> . the consecutive repeats wrap around the dna double helix, accommodating the rvds adjacent to the target dna bases in a one-to-one rvd-dna base fashion, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and/or wan-der waals forces between the 13th rvd residue and the dna base
 <cit> . these tal effector-targeted sequences have been initially called upt  boxes, and later more broadly, effector binding elements 
 <cit> . the discovery of the tal effector code has provided an invaluable tool for genome engineering by user-designed tal effectors fused to catalytic domains, or designer tal effectors to activate gene expression and explore their function during bacterial infection processes
 <cit> .

based on host-range, xanthomonas citri strains belong into different pathotypes being the asian group a the most aggressive that exhibit wide-host range. strains from groups b and c form a phylogenetically distinct clade originated in south america that exhibit limited host range
 <cit> . the tal effectors identified in x. citri strains were designated ptha“s”, pthb“s” and pthc“s”, and despite they are inherent in pathogenicity, the corresponding host gene targets remain uncharacterized
 <cit> . interestingly, a pioneering study showed that pathotypes a, b and c carry at least one isofunctional ptha, pthb or pthc effector of  <dig>  repeat domains, which is essentially required to elicit hyperplastic canker lesions on citrus
 <cit> . on the other hand, none of the tal effectors from the limited-host-range strains  was able to trigger the hypersensitive response  observed in grapefruit plants when expressed heterologously in other strain, suggesting that tal effectors from citrus canker pathogens do not limit host range but rather contribute to virulence associated functions
 <cit> .

recent reports have focused on the computational-based prediction of ebes in plant genomes to identify the putative host gene targets of tal effectors
 <cit> . for citrus, the in silico analyses to predict ptha“s” targets in sweet orange provided a set of candidates but additional experimental evidence of, e.g. gene expression, is still needed to validate such predictions
 <cit> . also, those studies did not include pthb“s” or pthc“s” effectors from the restricted host-range strains like xanthomonas aurantifolii pathotype c , which in turn trigger a defense response in sweet oranges. such analyses could provide molecular candidates that regulate the citrus defense response against xanthomonas spp. <cit> . in other pathosystems, the identification of tal effector-induced genes of x. vesicatoria and x. oryzae has revealed novel virulence mechanisms of plant bacteria mediated by the targeted transcriptional induction of key regulators of host susceptibility
 <cit> . therefore, identification of tal effector targeted factors that regulate citrus canker susceptibility is a milestone to understand and improve disease resistance.

using microarray analyses, we have previously shown that the genes up-regulated by xac in sweet orange leaves are involved in basal defense. in contrast, x. citri  induced genes associated with cell division and growth at the beginning of the infection process
 <cit> . we also found that many of the rapidly xc-induced genes, including cellulases, expansins and other cell-wall remodeling proteins, are co-regulated by auxin and gibberellin, hormones that are required for canker development
 <cit>  and control cell growth and expansion in other plant species
 <cit> . tal effectors not only play a central role as major determinants of host susceptibility, but are also capable of eliciting a resistance response when targeting hr-executor genes
 <cit> . based on these evidences, we hypothesized that tal effectors from xc and xac are directly regulating the transcription of sweet orange genes involved in canker formation and defense response, respectively.

in this study, we present a combination of bioinformatics, microarray analyses, and molecular assays to identify sweet orange genes targeted by ptha <dig>  ptha <dig> and pthc <dig> proteins. we show that the ectopic expression of ptha <dig>  ptha <dig> or pthc <dig> in citrus epicotyls resulted in the up-regulation of a group of genes involved in auxin and gibberellin response, cell growth, and defense response. our in silico studies using the tal effector code, predicted many ebes for the ptha“s” and/or pthc effectors in the promoter regions of genes induced in epicotyls expressing the corresponding tal effector. interestingly, we noticed that the ebes overlap with, or localize close to tata box elements of the promoters. in addition, despite the different rvd composition between ptha“s” and pthc“s”, our results indicate a targeting of functionally-related genes, which further support a model where tal effectors display the functional convergence by selective evolution as general tata-binding proteins
 <cit> . finally, we present experimental evidence suggesting that tal effectors from citrus canker pathogens also function as transcriptional repressors.

RESULTS
transcriptional changes in sweet orange triggered by xc tal effectors
by extensive gene expression analyses, we had identified numerous genes up-regulated during the canker disease development of sweet orange leaves infiltrated with xc
 <cit> . to test whether any of those genes are direct targets of tal effectors, we have undertaken two complementary approaches. first, we performed microarrays assays of orange leaves after bacterial infiltration in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide , a strategy that has early pinpointed avrbs <dig> targets in pepper plants
 <cit> . we found that many of the genes induced by xc at  <dig> and/or 48 h after infiltration
 <cit>  are also induced by xc in the presence of ch , thus indicating that xc elicit major transcriptional reprograming independent of protein synthesis. several of these differentially expressed genes are likely involved in terpene and gibberellin synthesis, ethylene production and signaling, cell-wall remodeling, cell division and defense responses . in particular, we noticed that the ethylene synthesis pathway represented by orthologs of acc synthase, acc oxidase and ap <dig> factor genes, which play roles in cell wall softening
 <cit> , appears to be a primary mechanism elicited in the host after xc sensing. on the other hand, defense response genes encoding chitinases, wrky factors and pathogenesis-related  proteins are also rapidly induced .

second, we transiently expressed the xc tal effectors ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> in sweet orange epicotyls and compared the transcriptional changes relative to epicotyls transformed with gus as a control . we selected ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> because they form heterodimers and interact with several citrus proteins implicated in transcriptional control
 <cit> . by inspecting the rvd sequences of ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> , we presumed that they would target common host genes. consistent with this observation, we found that the transient expression of ptha <dig> or ptha <dig> resulted in the up-regulation of a similar group of genes that are functionally related to both defense and disease development . the genes associated with canker development that were most strongly induced by both ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  encode cell-wall synthesis and remodeling enzymes, including a glycosyl transferase ortholog of upa <dig>  that is readily up-regulated by avrbs <dig> in pepper plants
 <cit> . in addition, the defense response induced genes encode chitinases, pr proteins and an acc synthase, which are also up-regulated by xc in the presence of ch, thus providing initial evidence that they might be functional targets of ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> . notably, numerous genes up-regulated in response to ptha <dig> or ptha <dig> are functionally related to auxin and gibberellin synthesis and signaling, cell division and growth, and defense responses . in particular, we noticed a strong ptha4-dependent induction of genes encoding cell division and expansion proteins including kinesins, tubulins, histones, ribosomal proteins, and orthologs of dem  and lob  . besides, the transcriptional profile of epicotyls expressing ptha <dig> is remarkably similar to that of citrus leaves infiltrated with xc 48 h post-inoculation
 <cit> , as shown by the up-regulation of a large number of genes related to auxin synthesis, mobilization, and signaling, including two homologs of the auxin influx carrier protein aux <dig> 
 <cit>  . in contrast, epicotyls expressing ptha <dig> showed the up-regulation of many genes implicated in cell-wall remodeling and gibberellin synthesis and signaling, including orthologs of upa <dig> and upa <dig> , and upa <dig> , respectively, which are putative targets of avrbs <dig> in pepper
 <cit>  . ptha <dig> also induced several genes encoding retrotransposons , which were also reported as off-targets of avrxa <dig> in rice
 <cit> .

gene onthology  enrichment analysis showed that while ptha <dig> modulate several genes categorized in cell-wall organization and rna-dependent dna replication and integration, ptha <dig> affected the expression of genes grouped under the microtubule-based movement and cell growth category. in addition, the go analysis showed that ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> commonly regulate a large number of genes involved in carbohydrate  metabolism, and cell-wall organization and biogenesis . these evidences support the functional convergence between xc tal effectors, and is in agreement with recent reports of x. oryzae tal effectors
 <cit> . in addition, the common targeting of ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> is a strong indicator that they may have additive or even synergistic roles for activation of host genes required for citrus canker susceptibility.
 <cit> , showing that ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> modulate several genes in sweet orange associated with canker development. despite the fact that ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> regulate distinct, but related sets of genes implicated in cell-wall remodeling, cell division and growth, they both altered group of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and cell-wall organization and biogenesis. the identity of the enriched genes can be found in additional file
 <dig> 

transcriptional changes in sweet orange triggered by pthc <dig>  a tal effector of x. aurantifolii
we have shown previously that xac elicit an hr-type response in sweet orange leaves, which is characterized by the up-regulation of multiple defense-related genes
 <cit> . to examine whether xac tal effectors are involved in the host transcriptional defense response, we cloned two tal effectors from xac strain icmp  <dig>  designated pthc <dig> and pthc <dig>  the essential differences between xac tal effectors occur in the number of repeat domains and the nature of the repeat variable diresidues , which altogether form the dna-binding domain of the protein
 <cit> . pthc <dig> has  <dig> rvds or  <dig>  repeat domains, and pthc <dig> is shorter with only  <dig> rvds or  <dig>  repeat domains . despite the overall structural similarities with ptha“s” of xc, pthc <dig> and pthc <dig> are phylogenetically more closely related to pthb“s” and pthc“s” from other pathotype b and c strains, respectively , that are distinguished by their limited host range
 <cit> . in terms of the rvd composition, pthc <dig> appears also more similar to pthb and pthc of other citrus canker strains reported to induce weak disease symptoms or hypersensitive response in sweet oranges
 <cit> . despite the fact that pthc from a group c strain was not required for the hr elicited on grapefruit
 <cit> , we decided to test whether pthc <dig> induce the expression of defense-related genes in sweet orange, as we observed during xac infection
 <cit> . therefore, we transfected pthc <dig> in sweet orange epicotyls and compared the transcriptional changes relative to epicotyls expressing ptha <dig>  ptha <dig>  or the gus gene as reference . we found that pthc <dig> elicit not only a different but also an opposite effect of ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  because its expression resulted in a general down regulation of genes involved in auxin and gibberellin synthesis and signaling, cell-wall remodeling, cell division, and defense responses . the fact that auxin and gibberellin promote initial canker pustule formations
 <cit>  indicate that pthc <dig>  in contrast to ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  do not contribute to canker symptoms in sweet orange. nevertheless, we found aux/iaa and bzip orthologous genes repressed by pthc <dig> , which function as negative regulators of the auxin and gibberellin signaling pathways affecting plant growth and development
 <cit> . in addition, the down-regulation of genes encoding gh3-like enzymes 
 <cit>  and indole-3-acetic acid amido synthase  suggest that pthc <dig> operates to increase the active pools of free auxin. on the other hand, we found no obvious hr-like executor among the genes up-regulated by pthc <dig> in sweet orange epicotyls , although an ap2-domain transcription factor orthologous of the tomato pti4
 <cit>  might be an interesting candidate .

together, these data show that pthc <dig>  in contrast to ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  regulate a different set of genes in sweet orange. although these genes may not significantly favor host susceptibility, they do not appear to be elicitors of an hr response either. this idea is consistent with the observation that a knockout mutation of pthc in a group c strain resulted in loss of pathogenicity on lime, but still triggers the hr response on grapefruit
 <cit> .

computational prediction of ebes for ptha and pthc in citrus genomes
the public release of the citrus sinensis and citrus clementina genomes together with the tal effector code of dna binding
 <cit> , provides a suitable model to investigate in silico the tal effector-targeted genes in citrus. because the computational tools available for tal effector targets prediction do not yet support analyses of the citrus genomes
 <cit> , we designed a position weight matrix based on tal effector-dna association frequencies to predict and score ebes for xc and xac tal effectors in citrus gene promoters . putative ebes for the four ptha“s” and the  <dig> pthc“s” of strains xc  <dig> and xac icmp  <dig>  respectively, were identified in nearly one thousand promoters. we then selected the top one hundred best scoring c. sinensis promoters ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for further analysis . in order to test the performance of our computational matrix analysis, we used the target finder function of the tal effector-nucleotide targeter  <dig>   tools
 <cit>  to search for ptha“s” and pthc“s” ebes in the top twenty best scoring promoters. we retrieved virtually the same ebe predictions with equivalent score values , indicating a similar achievement between our prediction method and the tale-nt tools.

next, we functionally categorized our candidates based on sequence homology to plant, yeast, or animal gene orthologs with known biological function . in addition to genes implicated in auxin and gibberellin synthesis and signaling, and in cell-wall remodeling, we found a substantial number of genes involved in cell division and morphogenesis, transcription regulation and defense . although most of our best scoring promoters do not correspond with the genes identified in our microarray analyses , these data seem to be meaningful because the predicted candidates belong to the same functional categories of those up-regulated in citrus epicotyls in response to ptha/pthc expression or in xc-infiltrated leaves in the presence of ch . remarkably, we predicted two pthc <dig> targets, orange <dig> g035902m.g and orange <dig> g035488m.g , with a strong similarity to the bs <dig> gene of pepper, which is an hr executor transcriptionally activated by avrbs <dig> of x. vesicatoria <cit> . we also found that several ptha“s” putative targets are involved in abscisic acid  synthesis, signaling and response, particularly for ptha <dig> . interestingly, some of these genes, including an aba8-hydroxilase , abi <dig>  and abi3-interacting protein- <dig> , also participate in the cross-talk between auxin and gibberellin, and in plant growth and development
 <cit>  .

experimental validation of putative gene targets of ptha and pthc effectors
although computational identification of tal effector-targeted genes have been recently conducted for tal effectors of x. oryzae and xc in their corresponding host genomes, the studies for xc are largely deficient on experimental validation for novel candidate targets
 <cit> . nevertheless, the combination of in silico predictions with gene expression data, demonstrated to be a suitable strategy to identify new biologically relevant tal effector targets
 <cit> . thus, in order to verify our in silico target predictions, we used the whole set of microarray data in our hands to search for experimental evidence of gene regulation of our predicted tal effector targets. we found that nearly 20% and 3% of the computational-predicted targets were up and down-regulated, respectively, indicating that tal effectors not only induce but may ultimately repress the expression of host predicted targets . using a cross-check criteria we were able to select targets that 1) are differentially expressed in epicotyls expressing the corresponding tal effector, 2) are also differentially expressed after infiltration of xc in the presence of ch, and 3) are functionally associated with the mechanisms of canker development or defense response .
c. sinensis 
that are transcriptionally regulated by xc in the presence of ch or, by the heterologous expression of the tal effector

to verify these data, we first confirmed the tal effector protein accumulation in epicotyls transiently expressing ptha <dig>  ptha <dig> or pthc <dig> , and subsequently examined the mrna levels of the predicted targets by quantitative rt-pcr on the transgenic tissues. totally, sixteen genes implicated in symptom development or defense response, were selected for target validation . these candidates were differentially expressed in response to xc infiltration and also after tal effector expression in epicotyls, and encoded at least one predicted ebe for the corresponding tal effector in their promoters. initially, we tested the expression of four putative ptha <dig> targets, including an ortholog of the pepper upa <dig>  which encodes a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase , a rac-gtpase gene , and an ortholog of the rat brg <dig>  implicated in cell wall strengthening, auxin response, and tumor development, respectively . consistent with the microarray data , the citrus upa <dig> and the brg <dig> genes were slightly but preferentially up-regulated by ptha <dig> compared to ptha <dig>  pthc <dig> or gus in epicotyls; in contrast, xet was significantly down-regulated in response to ptha <dig> . the rac gene, which was induced in epicotyls expressing ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  also appeared down-regulated in tissues expressing pthc <dig> . despite the strong induction of rac by ptha <dig> , we found no good scoring candidate ebes for ptha <dig> in the rac promoter. presumably, this is part of false negative predictions that account for the current limitations of computational analyses of tal effector targets
 <cit> .

to test the ptha <dig> candidate targets, we selected  <dig> genes encoding orthologous of a tobacco 14-3- <dig> protein, a two-domain dioxygenase , a cysteine protease , and a cc-nbs-lrr protein , which play roles in gibberellin synthesis, cell elongation and defense . consistent with the microarray data , we found that the four selected genes were strongly  up-regulated in epicotyls expressing ptha <dig>  which support the computational prediction of best scoring targets of ptha <dig> . although 14-3- <dig> and diox were induced moderately  in epicotyls expressing pthc <dig>  no ebes for pthc <dig> were identified in these targets.

we also tested the pthc <dig> predictions using  <dig> selected candidate genes, including the orthologs of a potato ca+2-dependent protein kinase  and tomato self-pruning interacting protein  <dig> , and two cc-nbs-lrr resistance genes  . an ortholog of the pepper bs <dig> gene  was also tested; however, we were not able to detect this gene by qpcr analysis, even using large amounts of cdna input. we found that sip <dig> and ccnbs <dig> genes were significantly induced in response to pthc <dig> expression relative to gus, although ccnbs <dig> was also up-regulated by ptha <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, sip <dig> and ccnbs <dig> appeared also induced in response to ptha <dig> expression. interestingly, we found an ebe for ptha <dig> in the sip <dig> promoter with a score value of  <dig>  that explains the observation. in contrast, cdpk was 3-fold repressed by pthc <dig> .

altogether, these results partially confirm the tal effector targets prediction but also suggest that more than one tal effector might induce the same gene, and that tal effectors can ultimately cause transcriptional repression of targets, although we have not tested whether this is a direct or indirect  effect of the protein.

to further investigate these observations, we evaluated the expression of a predicted ptha <dig> target, a phenylpropanoid:udp-glucosyltransferase , which was nearly 3-folds down-regulated in ptha2-expressing epicotyls . we also tested a predicted target of ptha <dig>  ptha <dig> and pthc <dig> encoding an avr9/cf9-elicited protein  <dig> homolog, ae <dig>  as well as two lateral organ boundaries genes, lob <dig> and lob <dig>  indentified as targets of ptha4/pthc <dig> and ptha <dig>  respectively . a previous report predicted that the citrus lob <dig> was targeted by ptha4
 <cit> . we found that ae <dig> is induced in response to ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> expression, but in contrast, ptha <dig>  ptha <dig> and pthc <dig>  down-regulate the expression of udpgt . consistent with our microarray data , lob <dig> was predominantly induced by ptha <dig>  but repressed by pthc <dig>  while all the three tal effectors tested induce the expression of lob <dig> .

we also used a ptha <dig> knockout derivative of xc, which is not pathogenic in sweet orange neither it induces hyperplasic lesions
 <cit> , to analyze the expression levels of candidate ptha <dig> targets. we found that three of the predicted ptha <dig> targets, diox, cp and 14-3- <dig>  are induced at higher levels in leaves infiltrated with the wild type xc strain relative to the ptha4-deletion mutant; however, these genes were also up-regulated by the ptha <dig> mutant relative to water infiltration, which indicates that these genes present a more complex mechanism of induction where ptha <dig> is not absolutely required .

we also evaluated the expression of two ptha <dig> predicted targets rac and lob <dig>  and two pthc <dig> targets lob <dig> and sip <dig>  which were highly up-regulated in epicotyls expressing ptha <dig> . although rac expression was under the level of detection by quantitative pcr , we found that the transcript accumulation of sip <dig> was lower in response to ptha4-deletion mutant relative to leaves infiltrated with the wild type xc . similarly, the expression levels of lob <dig> and lob <dig> were significantly lower in leaves infiltrated with the ptha4-deletion mutant . nevertheless, lob <dig>  lob <dig> and sip <dig> were also up-regulated in leaves infiltrated with the ptha4-deletion mutant relative to water-infiltrated leaves, suggesting an alternative mechanism of target induction, potentially by other tal effectors that our analysis failed to predict.

taken together these results confirm our previous observations, and point out to lob <dig>  lob <dig>  sip <dig>  cp and diox as primary targets of xc and xac tal effectors, in particular of ptha <dig> .

ptha and pthc ebes overlap with or localize close to tata box elements in citrus promoters
including avrbs <dig>  several tal effectors bind to ebes that overlap with tata-like sequences
 <cit> . in some cases this causes a downstream shift of the transcriptional start site in the targeted gene, suggesting that tal effectors might have a similar function of tata-binding proteins
 <cit> . here, we found that approximately 73% of the predicted ebes for ptha“s” and pthc“s” localize between  <dig> and 300 bp upstream the translation start codon of the genes . this observation and a recent study in rice suggesting that tal effectors of x. oryzae are predicted to bind within 300 bp upstream the start codon and frequently overlap with tata-box elements of the promoter
 <cit> , prompted us to evaluate whether the overlap or close proximity between tata boxes and ebe positions, also occurs for tal effectors of xc and xac in citrus promoters. we found that most of the ebes predicted for ptha“s” and pthc“s” show a tendency to overlap with, or localize within 30 bp of putativetata-box elements . for instance, in five of the candidate targets  the ebes overlapped with a putative tata box . thus, our data suggest that despite the rvd variations among these tal effectors, they are likely to have an evolutionary selection pressure towards the targeting of tata-rich regions of host sequences that are critical for the transcriptional regulation.

discussion
despite the fact that many tal effectors targets and their molecular functions have been coming to light in recent years
 <cit> , citrus genes directly activated by ptha“s” or pthc“s” effectors, and their role in canker development or host defense against xanthomonas spp., remain poorly characterized. in this study, we have identified a number of genes putatively targeted by ptha“s” and pthc“s” in sweet orange, and shown that most of them impinge on disease and/or host defense responses. we also observed that ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  yet bearing distinct rvds composition , exhibit functional convergence, in particular to regulate genes of the auxin and gibberellin synthesis and response pathways, as well as their downstream signaling cascade genes like those for cell wall remodeling, cell division and expansion. in citrus, targeting these hormonal pathways appear to be the headline of canker-causing xanthomonas spp. since endogenous auxin and gibberellin are required for initial canker formation in leaves infiltrated with the pathogen, and the exogenous application of the hormones transcriptionally regulate specific genes also induced by xc during the onset of infection
 <cit> . how these hormones contribute to the canker disease needs further exploration, but it is clear their relationship with the canker symptoms, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of mesophyll cells
 <cit> , which generate enough internal pressure to prompt the epidermal rupture and facilitate pathogen release to the leaf surface for disease propagation
 <cit> . besides, auxin also increase the host susceptibility on other plant-pathogen interactions
 <cit> , pointing it out as a conserved mechanism of biotrophic microbes to elicit cell wall softening to e.g., leak nutrients from the host cell, and/or to improve effectors translocation that promote host susceptibility and bacterial fitness. overall, it is tempting to speculate that, in the case of the citrus canker pathogens, manipulating the auxin signaling pathway via tal effector-targeting would be an effective way to disarm host defense responses for bacterial survival and pathogenicity. notably, many of the avrbs <dig> up-regulated  genes are also auxin-responsive and some of them including upa <dig>  upa <dig>  upa <dig> and upa <dig>  are known to enhance cell hypertrophy and the synthesis of cell-wall polymers
 <cit> .

these data reflect on recent studies suggesting that the redundancy and convergence in tal effector repertories occurring within and across x. oryzae strains, respectively, may be a conserved feature of tal effector evolution as a consequence of an arms race of the host-bacteria interaction
 <cit> . the biological meaning of such functional redundancy of tal effectors in strain  <dig>  particularly between ptha <dig> and ptha <dig>  denote a cooperative, or eventually a synergistic role of these effectors as transcriptional activators . in addition, it is interesting to note that ptha <dig> physically interacts with ptha <dig>  and that both proteins bind independently to the c-terminal domain of rna pol ii
 <cit> . hence, tal effector-mediated transcriptional regulation in citrus appears to be further influenced by the multiple protein-protein interactions occurring at the assembly locus of rna pol ii. according with this assumption, the up-regulation of lob <dig> and lob <dig> in epicotyls expressing ptha <dig> or ptha <dig> , and in sweet orange leaves infiltrated with xc or its ptha <dig> mutant derivative , emerges as an evident example of a redundant targeting of a presumably major gene for canker susceptibility. we also predicted another gene encoding a lob-domain protein targeted by ptha <dig>  orange <dig> g048558m.g . interestingly, lob genes have been associated to auxin signaling pathways, including cell growth control and organ development
 <cit> . from an evolutionary point of view, it seems advantageous for a single xc strain to target a family of potential susceptibility genes, i.e. lob genes with different tal effectors, which function cooperatively or synergistically, because it will assure the induction of the critical set of genes involved in disease symptoms development. the observation is convincing since it implies a mechanism that the pathogen uses to overcome potential natural polymorphisms in tal effector targeted promoters, in particular those occurring in susceptibility genes among different host varieties
 <cit> .

beyond the functional redundancy of xc tal effectors, we found that ptha <dig> predominantly induce genes encoding ribosomal proteins and proteins of cell division and growth, like kinesins, tubulins and histones . this is noteworthy because ptha <dig> also physically interacts with the citrus maf <dig> protein , which is a negative regulator of rna pol iii that controls ribosome biogenesis and suppresses canker symptoms
 <cit> . thus, the specific ptha4-induction of ribosomal protein genes appears to be a causal feedback mechanism of ribosome biogenesis that is required for cell division and growth. on the other hand, although ptha <dig> does not interact with csmaf <dig>  it binds to and inhibits the prolyl-isomerase activity of the citrus cyclophilin cscyp, a putative negative regulator of the rna pol ii complex
 <cit> . therefore, it remains to be determined how these protein specific interactions between tal effectors and components of rna pol ii and iii complexes affect the outcome of the host expression profiles in response to bacterial infection.

in contrast to ptha“s”-induced genes, epicotyls expressing pthc <dig> showed a general down-regulation of auxin and gibberellin response genes suggesting that this tal effector is not an elicitor of susceptibility. for instance, lob <dig> that is induced by ptha <dig>  appears significantly down-regulated by pthc <dig> , which is consistent with the pthc1-mediated repression of auxin response genes, since lob proteins have also been implicated in auxin signaling
 <cit> . however, it remains to be determined whether the general down-regulation of the auxin responsive genes by pthc <dig> in sweet orange is the major cause for the lack of host susceptibility  after infiltration of sweet orange with xac
 <cit> .

in pepper plants ecotype ecw- <dig>  the bs <dig> resistance gene induced by the x. vesicatoria tal effector avrbs <dig>  executes an hr response after bacterial infiltration
 <cit> . our computational analyses have predicted ebes of pthc <dig> in the promoters of two sweet orange genes orthologous to bs <dig>  orange <dig> g035488m.g and orange <dig> g035902m.g ; however, we were not able to detect their expression in response to pthc <dig> or after xac infiltration , and neither were them detected by any other gene expression analyses we conducted before i.e., differential display pcr and suppression subtractive hybridization
 <cit> . besides, though the results discussed above indicate that xac cannot induce host susceptibility, we do not yet discard the possibility that an hr-like elicitor is mediating the sweet orange defense against xac.

it has been verified and predicted that nodulin and flavone-3-hydroxylase  genes, respectively, represent common targets of xanthomonas ssp. tal effectors
 <cit> . here, we found four nodulin-related genes, which are significantly up-regulated in sweet orange leaves infiltrated with xc in the presence of ch, dn <dig>  or in epicotyls expressing ptha <dig>  cx <dig>  and ptha <dig>  dn <dig> and cv <dig>  however, we were not able to predict ebes for ptha“s” in their promoters suggesting a potential gap for false negative predictions of computational analyses, or eventually indicating that their induction is consequential of other primary targets of the tal effectors. on the other hand, we predicted ebes of ptha and/or pthc in the promoters of the nodulin-related genes orange <dig> g007766m.g and orange <dig> g042021m.g, but none of these genes were up-regulated in our microarray dataset .

one of the predicted targets of ptha <dig> is the citrus dioxygenase gene diox  that is similar to the rice gene f3h, also a predicted target of tal effectors from x. oryzae strains
 <cit> . although the f3h was linked to flavonoid biosynthesis
 <cit> , both f3h and diox are similar to gibberellin-20-oxidases , a group of enzymes that catalyze gibberellin biosynthesis
 <cit> . interestingly, as observed for the lob genes, a citrus gene encoding a putative ga <dig> oxidase  was identified as a target of ptha <dig>  ptha <dig> and ptha <dig> . this protein has the same domain architecture found in diox, which suggests they are functional orthologs. in addition, both ptha <dig> and pthc <dig> transactivate a regulator of gibberellin synthesis namely 14-3- <dig>  and a sip <dig> gene in epicotyls  whose protein products interact with a self-pruning factor involved in the control plant architecture and flowering of tomato
 <cit> . these evidences together support the susceptibility effect of inducing gibberellin genes during the process of infection.

another outcome of our study is the proximity of the predicted ebes relative to putative tata boxes of promoter regions . this is in line with the fact that ebes for x. oryzae tal effectors have been also identified close to tata elements in rice promoters
 <cit> . similarly, avrbs <dig> binding sites are found within 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site
 <cit> , raising the idea that tal effectors might functionally replace general tata-binding factors, as recently proposed
 <cit> . in addition, our data indicates that tal effectors can function as transcriptional repressors, in particular pthc <dig>  as discussed above .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified candidate targets of ptha“s” and pthc“s” in citrus that will not only strengthen our understanding on canker symptoms formation, but also provide novel information about host susceptibility or defenses against xanthomonas pathogens, which will assist in the selection and generation of canker resistant plants.
