BACKGROUND
a single nucleotide polymorphism  is a variation in a dna sequence that occurs in an appreciable portion of the population. high density snp microarrays provide information on the copy number of individual snps, based on measurement of the intensity of hybridized genomic dna fragments to the microarray. these microarrays also provide genotype information on the state of heterozygosity or homozygosity at each snp position. snp arrays facilitate studies of chromosomal copy number change, large-scale linkage analysis, and whole genome association studies.

a variety of platforms for snp-based genotyping are commercially available  <cit> . most rely upon amplification of genomic dna using the polymerase chain reaction  to reduce the complexity of the genome. one commonly used snp microarray from affymetrix consist of probesets corresponding to  <dig>  snps at unique genomic loci , with an average heterozygosity of about 37% and a median physical distance between snps of  <dig> kb  <cit> . another affymetrix platform contains  <dig>  snps  assigned to known loci. the affymetrix genechip dna analysis software  <dig>   algorithm implements a dynamic model-based algorithm to genotype each snp  <cit> . each snp genotype is assessed using  <dig> oligonucleotide probes organized into ten quartets consisting of probes representing both alleles. four possible states or genotype models are assigned to each probe , and a genotype call is assigned based on the confidence metric derived from the hybridization intensities to the probes  <cit> . thus, this approach focuses on the conventional assumption that most snps are biallelic .

in addition to genotyping, a second category of information provided by snp arrays is an estimation of the copy number of chromosomal dna based on the hybridization intensity signals of genomic dna samples. snp arrays have been used to assess copy number changes such as aneuploidy, deletions, and cancer-associated amplifications  <cit> . the affymetrix copy number analysis tool   <cit>  displays snp copy number values and corresponding probability  values across one chromosome, as well as genotype scores and p values as regions of loh. several recent reports describe the visualization of snp array data using this tool or similar plots of intensity ratios and/or log <dig> p values  versus chromosomal position   <cit> . these studies have validated the use of snp arrays to measure chromosomal copy number changes.

a basic requirement of large-scale snp assays is data visualization, which facilitates data analysis, statistical interpretation, and the identification of patterns of biological interest. we developed snpscan as a tool for the visualization and analysis of high throughput snp array data. its main features are the ability to display the combined information of copy number and genotype, as well as associated p values, in a single plot for a dataset; the ability to simultaneously plot multiple data sets at user specified size; world wide web accessibility; paired  ratio comparisons; and the ability to generate a file for visualization of snp data on the genome browser developed by the university of california, santa cruz   <cit> .

an additional feature of snpscan is its ability to identify regions of uniparental disomy . upd occurs when both copies of a chromosome are inherited from one parent  <cit> . two identical copies of the same chromosome may be inherited from one parent , or two distinct copies of a particular chromosome may be inherited from the same parent . upd may occur across an entire chromosome or segmentally, following somatic events such as mitotic recombination. snpscan is useful to identify uniparental isodisomy on the basis of a region of homozygosity with a normal copy number. uniparental isodisomy can be discerned through analysis of an individual genomic dna sample. given the data from parental genotypes, uniparental heterodisomy can also be identified.

RESULTS
implementation of snpscan
snpscan was written in the perl programming language  <cit> , permitting uploads of the user's data, setting of the user's selections, and execution of functions implemented in the r programming language  <cit> . the r codes execute snpscan's algorithm and generate graphics in several formats, to be sent back to the user via the snpscan website  <cit>  written in html and running under an apache web server.

data input
the input data for snpscan is a text file generated by affymetrix cnatv <dig>  software, via its export tool . the platform may be the affymetrix  <dig> k,  <dig> k hind,  <dig> k xba, or  <dig> k  mapping arrays.  the text file has rows corresponding to snps. for  <dig> k arrays, the column headers are  row numbers,  probe set ,  chromosome,  physical position,  id_call ,  id_spa_cn ,  id_spa_pval ,  id_cpa_pval ,  id_loh . for each additional case analyzed by cnat, columns  through  are repeated with values for that dataset. the snpscan algorithm accepts a text file containing all this information, but does not analyze the id_cpa_pval data . for  <dig> k or  <dig> k arrays, columns  through  are as described above, followed by  id_gsa_cn,  id_gsa_pval, and  id_loh. the snpscan algorithm uses all these column values.

the columns that are used by snpscan thus consist of snp identifiers, chromosomal assignment and physical map position, and five additional columns for each array sample, as follows.  the call has four states: aa, bb, ab, or nocall . these calls are determined in gdas software using a dynamic model mapping algorithm, based on snp intensity data  <cit> .  the copy number has values typically ranging from ~ <dig> to  <dig>  with a typical mean value of ~ <dig>  corresponding to disomic, autosomal loci and a mean of ~ <dig>  for hemizygous male x chromosome snps.  the negative log <dig> p value for copy number changes is a measure of the statistical significance of copy number changes. for example, a value of  <dig> corresponds to p < 10- <dig> for rejecting the null hypothesis that no copy number changes have occurred at a given locus. the p values in gdas are calculated by comparison of experimentally derived copy number values to values from  <dig> normal individuals.  an estimate of the statistical significance of copy number changes, accounting for the local regional changes in copy number.  a confidence metric of the genotype call, selected in gdas by choosing the smallest p value from a wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the four possible call models.

a typical snpscan analysis, consisting of data on ~ <dig>  snps on ten individuals, is approximately  <dig> megabyte in size for file upload. we have chosen a default restriction of  <dig> megabytes to the file size for upload.  there are three upload web pages, one for each of the snpscan tools ; a screenshot of one upload page is shown in fig.  <dig>  sample data files are provided at the snpscan website to help users become accustomed to the tools  <cit> . snpscan currently supports analyses using ncbi builds  <dig> and  <dig> 

data output: snpscanplot
there are three main outputs of snpscan: a web page called snpscanplot , a wiggle track  file that is used to visualize snp data in a human genome browser , and a series of plots and tables that summarize snp genotype and copy number data . for each snp array dataset analyzed with the snpscanplot, the output includes the following features . the panels arranged vertically correspond to individual samples . within each individual, the y-axis of the plot has three meanings, displayed with dots, bars, and connected lines of varying colors. the first meaning corresponds to copy number, represented by dots, with a user-defined scale . the second meaning is the grey vertical bar corresponding to loh . the third meaning of the y-axis is the absolute value of the log <dig> p value of the single-point copy number . the points, in addition to representing the copy number, are also color-coded according to the possible calls: red , blue , and green .

this combination of allelic calls with copy number is a unique feature of snpscan. the sequence of plotting  is also uniquely arranged. combining these two designs, snpscan can be used to display and thus discover a variety of chromosomal anomalies. as an example, apparent homozygosity in the snp output  can be due to true homozygosity, or to a hemizygous deletion  that is interpreted as homozygous by the gdas software. interpretation of snpscan plot outputs can resolve this issue for stretches of homozygosity by simultaneously displaying the copy number  along with the genotype. for authentic homozygosity, the copy number is not changed, while for hemizygous deletions, the copy number is reduced and there is a significant -log <dig> p value.

fig. 2b shows a typical higher-resolution graphical output for a female case  and a male case  on chromosomes  <dig> and x. the single  male x chromosome has a large grey region , many blue dots  few heterozygous  points, and an apparent copy number loss  relative to chromosome  <dig> and relative to the female x chromosomes. for each chromosome, a short bar indicates the position of the centromere.

each data set  in snpscanplot includes four statistics in the labeling area at the right of the plot. these are : the call rate , the mean, the standard deviation, and heterozygosity rate  . the call rate information includes all selected chromosomes. the mean, the standard deviation, and the heterozygosity rate  include only selected autosomes, unless chromosome x is the only selected chromosome. these values can be used to assess the chromosome copy number in a given chromosome .

graphical output file formats
each snpscanplot result can be provided in several formats. the server returns a portable network graphics  output at a 20% reduction in size, to better fit into the screen, for a quick overview . the user can click on the png figure to obtain a tagged image file format  file displayed at the full size as specified by the user . this allows a more detailed view, but is slower for download due to the larger file size. links are also provided to obtain a portable document format  file, as well as a postscript  file, to permit extremely detailed viewing and printing . the file size for a  <dig> k snp array data set for ten individual arrays is typically  <dig> kilobytes for png,  <dig>  megabytes for tiff,  <dig> megabytes for pdf, and  <dig> megabytes for ps.

data output: genome browser
the snpscan program allows input data files to be converted to the wig file format. this allows display of continuous-valued data in a track format that is compatible with the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . an example is shown in fig.  <dig>  four custom tracks, visualized by uploading the wig file to the ucsc genome browser website  <cit> , are shown for chromosome  <dig>  many dozens of additional tracks may be added to the browser, and the data may be explored from a scale of several bases to the entire length of a chromosome.

data output: plots and tables
a third feature of snpscan is a group of graphical and tabular summary statistics to describe the genotype and copy number calls from a snp data set. examples include a tabular listing of snps organized by the size of a group of homozygous calls , and a plot of the number of instances of blocks of homozygous snps as a function of the length of the group .

identifying microdeletions via snpscan
we analyzed a series of cases to demonstrate and validate the use of snpscan. these cases include microdeletions, upd, and possible chromosomal mosaicisms .

case 1: deletion on chromosome 7
hoover-fong and colleagues described a female neonate with a unique phenotype of severe facial anomalies including anophthalmia, cryptophthalmos, bilateral cleft lip, and unilateral cleft palate  <cit> . conventional karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization  revealed a 7p <dig> - <dig>  deletion  <cit> . we isolated genomic dna from a lymphoblastoid cell line  and generated snp data using both  <dig> k and  <dig> k mapping arrays. using snpscan, we visualized the 7p deletion region . note the presence of a reduced copy number, a preponderance of heterozygous calls  with almost no heterozygous calls , and a high -log <dig> copy number p value . we estimated the size of the deletion by analyzing the cnat-derived calculation of the cnat copy number value, single point analysis copy number p value, and p value for loh region based on genotype calls. together, these parameters define the beginning and end positions of deleted regions. for this case, the size of the deletion was  <dig> – <dig>  megabases  based on  <dig> k,  <dig> k xba and  <dig> k hind snp arrays , further refining it from a reported estimate of  <dig> mb  <cit> . in addition, we used genomic microarrays  in a dye-swap protocol to independently confirm the extent of the deletion on chromosome 7p . the genomic array result suggests an interstitial deletion of  <dig>  mb, consistent with the snp data analysis.

the clinical anomalies observed in this case result from a developmental insult between four and seven weeks of gestation. a description of the exact genes that are deleted in this syndrome is necessary to elucidate the etiology of the disorder. generation of a wig file and display of the deletion region on the ucsc genome browser provided a view of the genomic landscape including the affected genes .

case 2: deletion on chromosome 3
cargile et al. identified a case with 3p deletion syndrome, with the karyotype  <dig> xy,del.ish del <cit> . clinical features, typical for deletion 3p syndrome  <cit> , included ptosis, microcephaly, growth retardation, and developmental delay. fish studies narrowed the deleted region to  <dig>  mb, the smallest ever identified for this syndrome. we obtained genomic dna from a lymphblastoid cell line , generated  <dig> k and  <dig> k snp array data, and identified the 3p deletion region. a region of blue  and green  dots, with a copy number below  <dig>  is evident in the whole-genome view  and at higher magnification . loh of snps indicated a deleted region of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. analysis of genomic microarrays suggested an interstitial loss of 3p from rp11-21j <dig> to rp11-91k <dig> , consistent with snp data . this patient lacks many major clinical features that are typically present in 3p deletion syndrome, such as cardiovascular defects, renal anomalies, triangular face and rocker bottom feet. thus it is of interest to define the genes that are deleted in this case, as well as the ones that are spared.

case 3: deletion on chromosome 2
an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2q32- <dig> associated with carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i  deficiency, a urea cycle defect, was reported by loscalzo and colleagues  <cit> . we obtained a skin fibroblast cell line , purified genomic dna, and performed  <dig> k xba snp mapping arrays and array comparative genomic hybridization . in this case a deletion region of approximately  <dig>  mb was refined to  <dig>  mb using snp arrays , and to  <dig>  mb by genomic arrays . the region of deletion is characterized by a large grey area , by many blue dots  and green dots . the few red dots  are consistent with the error rate on this individual's x chromosome . the copy number of the deletion region is  <dig> , comparable to the x chromosome copy number  and less than the nondeleted portion of chromosome  <dig> .

identifying uniparental isodisomy via snpscan
uniparental isodisomy can be detected in the analysis of snp array data by the presence of regions of homozygosity  in the absence of copy number changes. we applied snpscan to the analysis of a previously identified patient  and apparently normal individuals from the ceph collection . altug-teber et al.  <cit>  recently used affymetrix  <dig> k mapping arrays to analyze complete or segmental upd in six families with diagnoses of prader-willi syndrome , angelman syndrome , silver-russell syndrome , beckwith-wiedemann syndrome , pseudohypoparathyroidism  and a chromosomal rearrangement . we analyzed these data in snpscan and observed uniparental isodisomy consistent with the findings of altug-teber et al. .

case 4: 14q uniparental isodisomy in a patient with a translocation
antonarakis and colleagues described a nine-year old female with a de novo robertsonian translocation t, short stature, developmental delay, and other symptoms  <cit> . genotyping of polymorphic markers indicated maternal upd for chromosome  <dig>  including isodisomy for proximal markers and heterodisomy for distal markers. additionally, there was mosaic trisomy  <dig> detected in 5% of blood lymphocytes. we obtained a lymphoblastoid cell line , purified genomic dna and performed snp array analysis. uniparental isodisomy was evident by a large region of homozygous calls , high loh , and significant p values . we calculated that the copy number for chromosome  <dig> was  <dig>  ; however, we did not independently confirm the presence of trisomy in these lymphoblasts, and in general this limited degree of mosaic trisomy does not permit visual identification of subtle copy number changes.

case 5: uniparental isodisomy in an apparently normal female
we tested the functionality of snpscan by visualizing snp data from  <dig> individuals  assayed by affymetrix on its  <dig> k snp mapping set. the data are publicly available  <cit> . these samples are ceph trios from the international hapmap project  <cit>  with no known chromosomal disorders. a group of ten ceph snp data sets visualized with snpscan is shown in fig. 7a. in case na <dig>  a male with at least six grandchildren, we observed uniparental isodisomy across the entire long arm of chromosome  <dig> . for all apparently normal ceph cases we studied for which we observed chromosomal abnormalities, there are no known instances of unreported kinship  <cit> .

to confirm that case na <dig> had an extended region of homozygosity, we amplified genomic dna from that case and five randomly selected ceph controls. we generated and sequenced eight pcr products, four from chromosome 1p  and four from 1q . the snp calls were consistent with the sequenced dna except for one snp , in which all dna sequences were homozygous while all snp array calls were heterozygous. that discrepancy is likely explained because the  <dig> nucleotides spanning that snp are expected to hybridize to two distinct positions on chromosome  <dig>  based on blast searching.

for case na <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> snps on chromosome 1q were homozygous, while only  <dig> of  <dig> snp positions on 1p were homozygous . by comparison to five controls, this result is not likely to have occurred by chance . for the snp sequences on the 1p arm, the results for case na <dig> included three positions of heterozygosity, and did not differ from five control cases . thus, dna sequencing of genomic dna confirmed the homozygosity on 1q for n <dig>  consistent with an interpretation of uniparental isodisomy as visualized by snpscan.

the copy numbers and call rates typically vary between experiments. for the ten apparently normal individuals in fig. 7a, the mean autosomal copy number values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , with call rates from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. for the cases in fig. 5a, the mean autosomal copy number values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , with call rates from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. snpscan is useful for identification of abnormalities with datasets of varying call rates.

case 6: partial 2q uniparental isodisomy
inspection of snpscan visualization of the  <dig> ceph trios revealed a possible case of partial uniparental isodisomy on chromosome 2q in case na <dig>  a 65-year old female with at least six grandchildren . snpscan showed a small segment in chromosome 2q of na <dig> as homozygous. using the table and plot tool, we determined that region includes a stretch of  <dig> homozyogous snps in hind  <dig> k array, and  <dig> snps in the xba  <dig> k array. the length of this region was  <dig>  mb.

identifying mosaic chromosomal deletions via snpscan
mosaic chromosomal gains and losses complicate snp analysis because somatic tissues may express variable chromosomal changes between cell types or within a population of cells. snpscan can detect some cases of mosaicism as well as related problems such as mislabelled samples.

case 7: 2q deletion with mosaicism found in an apparently normal control
by using snpscan to analyze the 100k snp data from apparently normal ceph controls, we identified a previously unreported microdeletion on chromosome 2q <dig>  of a healthy caucasian female . there was a region of homozygosity, with only three ab calls among a span of  <dig> consecutive snps from the hind chip, and  <dig> ab calls among  <dig> consecutive snp calls from the xba chip. for this putative deletion region, the copy number was  <dig> .  there was an increased proportion of no calls in this region , also consistent with the occurrence of a hemizygous deletion. we used fish to confirm the presence of a deletion. using two bac probes ,  <dig> of  <dig> metaphase cells  displayed a deletion in 2q <dig>  while the other  <dig> metaphase cells displayed both copies. an example of each case is shown in fig.  <dig>  these results suggest that the individual had a mosaic deletion in this region. this is consistent with the information displayed by the ucsc genome browser , where the cn  track had lower values, the p_value track indicated the statistical significance of the copy number change, but the loh track showed many fragmented bars of light color  due to the mosaic nature of this cell line. in an independent study, researchers at the coriell cell repositories performed acgh using spectral genomics microarrays on this cell line . a deletion of  <dig>  mb was observed, consistent with our findings.

case 8: identifying loss of the x chromosome with mosaicism
analysis of case na <dig> with snpscan indicated a loss of one copy of the x chromosome, with mosaicism . na <dig> was a 42-year old caucasian female with  <dig> children. of the  <dig> ceph individuals, the mean copy numbers for all  <dig> male x chromosomes was  <dig>  for hind and  <dig>  for xba  <dig> k arrays, whereas the mean copy number for all  <dig> female x chromosomes was  <dig>  for hind and  <dig>  for xba. for case na <dig>  the copy numbers were  <dig>  for hind and  <dig>  for xba. this finding would be expected if 70% of the cells from this individual had only one copy of chromosome x. subsequent karyotyping by the coriell cell repositories indicated that an x chromosome was missing from 68% of the cells, with a karyotype  <dig> x34/ <dig> xx <dig> .

loss of a copy of the x chromosome can occur in females in vivo as a function of age, and in cell cultures in vitro as a function of population doublings. further examination of snpscan data revealed three other females  with low chromosome x copy numbers, as listed in table  <dig>  these likely also represent females having mosaic loss of the x chromosome as revealed by snpscan.

case 9: identifying mislabelled snp data
when displaying the  <dig> k trio data downloaded from affymetrix's website, snpscan revealed several anomalous results for na <dig>  and na <dig> , as shown in figure  <dig>  for the na <dig>  hind  <dig> k data, there were unexpectedly  <dig> heterozygous calls and a copy number of  <dig>  for the x chromosome, typical of a female snp profile. for the na <dig>  hind data set there were zero ab calls and an x chromosome copy number of  <dig> , typical of a male snp profile. the xba  <dig> k array data appeared appropriate for each gender. we concluded that the labels on the hind snp data sets were likely erroneous. after swapping them  the apparent error was corrected. the ab calls and averaged copy number of chromosome x, listed in table  <dig>  also confirmed these labelling errors.

paired data comparison via snpscan
in some applications of snp technology, paired samples  from one individual are analyzed. if the paired data option is selected, snpscan generates a third plot for every two snp data set inputs, in the input # <dig> vs. input # <dig> order. the third plot provides a series of comparisons between the samples.

case 10: paired samples
we analyzed data from paired lung cancer and unaffected tissue  from the same individual . when the paired data comparison option is selected in snpscan, the user must provide an even number of snp data sets in the input file. snpscan allows its users to choose plotting colors for eight types of information that are displayed to visualize differences between a paired set of samples. the eight categories are  retention of homozygosity ;  retention of heterozygosity ;  genotype change from homozygous to heterozygous ;  loh genotype change ;  nocall in the first sample but not in the second;  nocall in the second sample but not in the first;  nocall in both; and  diploid switch . fig.  <dig>  highlights a narrow region of copy number gain  in a tumor sample. genotype changes from heterozygous to homozygous are highlighted in red, showing a cluster of such changes in the amplification region. this might have occurred due to the expansion of one allele resulting in apparent homozygosity.

comparison to existing tools
snpscan can be compared to other algorithms and programs that perform the analysis and visualization of snp microarray data. various tools have been created to analyze snp data, including the discovery and analysis of snps as well as predictions of functional aspects of snps . a variety of reports describe snp copy number and genotype  data in adjacent plots  <cit> , highlighting the usefulness of snp arrays in generating both types of information. a relatively limited number of tools provide data visualization features partially overlapping those of snpscan, as follows.

affymetrix's copy number analysis tool v <dig> 
snpscan analyzes snp data that have been processed by cnatv <dig> , providing a variety of features for further analysis and visualization. cnatv <dig>  provides a visualization tool showing neighborhood smoothed copy number, an associated p value, and loh information on three separate tracks, for one chromosome of one individual at a time  <cit> . it does not provide the capability to efficiently scan for chromosomal anomalies in datasets from a large number of individuals. in contrast, snpscan allows data from multiple individuals to be analyzed simultaneously, limited only by the size of the upload buffer.  relative to cnatv <dig> , snpscan offers unique features including visualization of regions of uniparental isodisomy, tabular and graphic summaries of genotype and copy number data, and conversion of snp data to the wig format. cnatv <dig>  allows conversion of snp files to an integrated genome browser format, but does not permit direct upload to the ucsc genome browser, and only one metric  may be exported at a time.

dchipsnp
dchipsnp permits concurrent analysis of loh and copy number changes in paired samples  <cit> . the three main functions of dchipsnp  <cit>  include statistical inference to identify loh regions, copy number analysis, and linkage analysis. the copy number analysis tool of dchipsnp offers a raw, or an inferred, copy number track using multiple normal samples for reference  <cit> . the algorithm includes a hidden markov model to make inferences about loh, with four states in the model comparing normal and tumor samples . dchipsnp is a highly useful program, but requires paired samples for its loh analyses, making it particularly appropriate for comparisons of tumor dna and matched controls. while snpscan is platform-independent, dchipsnp use is restricted to the windows operating system.

copy number analyzer for affymetrix genechip mapping  <dig> k arrays 
nannya et al. introduced an algorithm for analysis of paired samples using data from affymetrix genechip mapping  <dig> k arrays  <cit> . the cnag algorithm provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of copy number changes through the use of a hidden markov model. its features include corrections for the length and gc content of pcr products used for array hybridization, and optimized selection of the reference samples. the output includes a chromosome ideogram  versus a series of tracks  containing copy number ratios, copy number inference from a hidden markov model, and heterozygous snp calls. cnag thus is distinguished from snpscan which displays combined copy number and genotype information. cnag is available by download as a set of algorithms written in c++ for microsoft windows, but a web-based implementation is currently unavailable.

discussion
a variety of technologies have been applied to the measurement of chromosomal abnormalities including conventional karyotyping , fish, and conventional and array-based cgh  <cit> . snp arrays represent a high-density, high-throughput technique with the capacity for measuring highly informative allelic information from complex genomic dna samples  <cit> . for snp array data analysis, a major requirement is accurate measurement of the genotype call and the copy number. affymetrix gdas software provides calls using a dynamic model algorithm. gdas includes a calculation of the probability of a stretch of homozygosity occurring at random in the dataset, based on the probability of a homozygous call for each snp relative to a reference set of  <dig> individuals  <cit> . the gdas and cnat software further provide estimates of the chromosome copy number. p values are generated by comparison of observed single-point and genome-smoothed estimates of the copy number to a reference set of  <dig> ethnically diverse individuals  <cit> . genome-smoothed estimates account for the behavior of neighboring snps in analyzing copy number and associated p values.

in addition to generating statistical estimates of genotype and copy number values in samples assayed on snp arrays, it is also essential to visualize the data. we created snpscan as a web-accessible tool to both analyze and visualize data sets that have been initially processed in gdas and cnat.

snpscan is useful for the following six reasons.  snpscan provides a variety of useful summary statistics. these include the mean autosomal copy number and standard deviation as well as the call rate and percent heterozygosity for each snp dataset. the snpscan plots and tables also offer a variety of summary measures of loh and copy number changes .  it is extremely helpful to visualize data across multiple individuals  to assess whether observed changes are specific to particular samples. in some applications, it is also helpful to analyze paired  samples .  a main feature of snpscan plots is the integration of copy number and genotype data. this is crucial in interpreting the genetic mechanisms could account for observed snp data, including deletions and duplications. visualization using snpscan indicated a series of chromosomal abnormalities. we validated several of these by fish, genomic dna sequencing, and acgh. a number of these chromosomal anomalies, such as mosaic loss of a portion of chromosome  <dig> , and mosaic loss of the x chromosome in four apparently normal females , would have been difficult to detect without an appropriate visualization tool. while snpscan is useful to identify a variety of chromosomal abnormalities, it is also important to consider possible genetic mechanisms such as de novo mutations, inherited mutations, inbreeding, etc.  in addition to being web-accessible, snpscan offers both low-resolution  and high-definition  graphical output formats at user-defined sizes.  as a further feature of snpscan, snp datasets can be converted to the wig format for visualization with the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . this provides tremendous flexibility and depth in further exploring the genomic landscape of potentially affected regions.  snp arrays also represent a powerful tool for the detection of upd and in particular uniparental isodisomy, which appears as a region of homozygosity without copy number change. snpscan permitted detection of upd in a previously characterized clinical case  and in an apparently normal case . there are three main disease consequences that may be caused by upd, all of which could occur in a single patient: trisomy mosaicism, homozygosity of recessive autosomal mutations, and genomic imprinting  <cit> . while upd has only been appreciated as a genetic phenomenon since  <dig>  <cit> , it is likely that the analysis of high-density snp data will enable the discovery of many more cases.

CONCLUSIONS
snpscan enables its users to convert high throughput, alphanumeric snp data into plots of various sizes and resolutions for rapid visual identification of chromosomal anomalies. snpscan uniquely correlates each snp's copy number information with its allelic call information. the correlated data plotted across physical positions, aided with loh and p-value information, generates distinct patterns for easy visual identification of a variety of abnormalities. snpscan is freely available to the research community.
