BACKGROUND
pulmonary fibrosis, a severe pathological outcome associated with several lung diseases, can be commonly reproduced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin, a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent. the tissue remodeling that ensues is characterized by severe inflammation  and a delayed phase with fibroblast proliferation and excess matrix deposition  <cit> . the pathological events leading to pulmonary fibrosis have been attributed to an overproduction of interstitial collagens by cytokine-activated fibroblasts  <cit> ; moreover, though a variety of cytokines have been implicated in fibroblast activation, a paramount causative role for transforming growth factor -β <dig> has emerged. this cytokine activates fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts  <cit>  and stimulates extracellular matrix  production  <cit> . however, besides its pro-fibrotic properties, tgf-β <dig> exerts a number of other homeostatic functions in immune and cancer biology  <cit> , so that inhibition of tgf-β <dig> would provoke a series of adverse effects, making it not that valuable as a therapeutic approach. other therapeutic interventions include anti-inflammatory drugs  that are effective to relieve disease without halting fibrosis progression. anti-fibrotic drugs do not improve lung function or life expectancy and their use may also be associated with harmful side effects  <cit> . nonetheless, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis is increased, and this might help for the identification of targets amenable for the development of novel therapies  <cit> .

there is great interest on biochemical pathways centered on endogenous inhibitors endowed with counter-regulatory and protective functions  <cit> . most of these studies have focused on acute inflammation, elucidating endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways that operate in parallel, and sometimes in a time-delayed fashion, to the more widely studied pro-inflammatory mediators, to ensure rapid resolution of the host response with return to tissue homeostasis  <cit> . one line of research has focused on the glucocorticoid-regulated protein annexin a <dig> , a potent modulator of leukocyte trafficking/transmigration in acute and chronic inflammation  <cit> , with a particular ability to inhibit the leukocyte/endothelium interaction in the microvasculature  <cit> . characterization of an anxa <dig> null mouse colony has revealed, upon stimulation, a dysregulation of pathophysiological mechanisms, with an exacerbation of acute and chronic experimental inflammatory responses  <cit> .

the anxa <dig> protein is highly expressed in the airways, both in human/animal alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells  <cit> , a finding explained by constitutive gene promoter activity in bronchial epithelium and lung endothelial cells  <cit> . the anxa <dig> anti-inflammatory effects can be replicated by a shorter peptide spanning the first  <dig> amino acids, termed peptide ac2- <dig>  both anxa <dig> and its n-terminal derived peptides exert potent regulation of the inflammatory reaction by activating its receptor, the formyl-peptide receptor   <cit> , with consequent inhibition of white blood cell trafficking and promotion of efferocytosis  <cit> . of interest in the context of lung inflammation, down-regulation of endogenous anxa <dig> expression has been noted in the bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid of cystic fibrosis patients  <cit> . more recently, blockade of the transmembrane conductance regulator protein  led to the release of anxa <dig> from human and mouse neutrophils, a finding associated with an altered acute inflammatory reaction  <cit> .

against this background, the present study was undertaken to compare cellular, tissue and macroscopic alterations observed in the model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in wild type and anxa <dig> null mice. moreover, the pattern of expression of the endogenous protein and gene promoter activity were monitored, and the pharmacological potential of anxa <dig> peptido-mimetic was assessed.

methods
animals
male c57bl/ <dig> wild type and anxa <dig> null mice  <cit>  , maintained on a standard chow pellet diet with tap water ad libitum, were used for all experiments. animals were housed at a density of five animals per cage in a room with controlled lighting  in which the temperature was maintained at 21-23°c. animal work was performed according to uk home office regulations , committee of ethics in animal research, famerp, sp, brazil  and along the directives of the european union.

murine model of lung fibrosis
pulmonary fibrosis was induced by intratracheal  administration of bleomycin  suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline  at  <dig>  u/kg. control mice received saline vehicle only . at different time post intratracheal injection  mice were anesthetized with ketamine  and xylazine  solution  for blood and bal fluid collection. in some cases, animals were perfused with  <dig> ml of pbs to remove blood contents from tissues, and lung were collected and processed as described below. animal survival was monitored daily up to  <dig> days post-bleomycin. in case of death, the experiments were repeated to achieve the minimal number of  <dig> animals per group.

in some cases, mice were treated daily with  <dig> mg/kg intraperitoneally  of peptide ac2- <dig>  starting immediately after the first dose of bleomycin . another group of bleomycin-treated mice received the same dose and route of peptide ac2- <dig> from day  <dig> to day  <dig> post-bleomycin . control mice were treated daily with ac2- <dig> , but were i.t. treated with saline only instead of bleomycin. in all cases, animals were sacrificed at day  <dig> for lung histology and immunohistochemistry, and western blotting analyses.

histopathological analyses
wild type and anxa <dig> null lungs were excised, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,  <dig>  m sodium phosphate buffer  for  <dig> h at 4°c; then, they were fragmented, washed, dehydrated in ethanol, clarified in xylene and embedded in paraplast™ . histological sections were cut , mounted on slides, and stained with masson's trichrome. quantification of leukocyte numbers in tissue samples was performed by the point-counting technique  <cit>  with a high-power objective  and measuring the area of analysis with the software axiovision . data was reported as cells/mm <dig> .

whole lung homogenates and collagen assays
total lung hydroxyproline contents were determined using a well-accepted assay  <cit> . briefly, samples of lung homogenate  were added to  <dig> ml of  <dig> n hydrochloric acid for  <dig> h at 120°c. to a  <dig> μl sample of the digested lung,  <dig> μl of citrate/acetate buffer  and  <dig> μl of chloramine-t solution  were added. the resulting samples were then incubated at room temperature for  <dig> min before addition of  <dig> μl of ehrlich's solution ,  <dig>  ml of n-propanol, and  <dig>  ml of 70% perchloric acid. after a further incubation at 65°c samples for  <dig> min, samples were read at  <dig> nm in a du <dig> spectrophotometer ; hydroxyproline concentrations were then calculated from standard curve .

cellular analysis of blood and bal fluids
aliquots of blood  obtained from the abdominal artery were diluted 1: <dig> in turk's solution  for cell quantification. after semi-excision of the trachea, a plastic cannula was inserted and airspaces were washed with  <dig>  ml of  <dig> % sodium chloride containing  <dig>  mm edta with a  <dig> ml syringe. this operation was repeated twice. bal was centrifuged  and the cell-free supernatants were frozen at -80°c for subsequent cytokine analysis. cell pellets were re-suspended and an aliquot  was diluted 20: <dig> in turk's solution  for cell quantification.

in both cases, total and differential counting was obtained with a neubauer chamber using a × <dig> objective in the light microscope axioskop ii mot plus . bal cells were distinguished in polymorphonuclear , mononuclear phagocytic cells  and lymphocytes , whereas blood cells were divided into pmn, peripheral blood monocytes  and ly.

cytokine levels
aliquots of blood and bal fluids were centrifuged at  <dig> and  <dig> g for  <dig> min, respectively. concentrations of tumor necrosis factor -α, transforming growing factor -β and interferon -γ were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits purchased from r&d system .

immunohistochemistry
anxa <dig> protein expression in tissue cells was determined by immunohistochemistry, as reported  <cit> . briefly, wild type lung samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde  and embedded in lr gold resin . histological sections  were blocked with 10% albumin bovine in pbs , and a polyclonal rabbit anti-anxa <dig> antibody  added  overnight at 4°c. as negative control of the reaction, some histological sections of wild type lungs were incubated with non-immune rabbit serum  instead of the primary antibody. a goat anti-rabbit igg  antibody conjugated to  <dig> nm colloidal gold  was then added. silver enhancing solution  was used to augment gold particle staining and histological sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. analysis of anxa <dig> expression was conducted with an axioskop ii microscope . the stained area was analyzed densitometricaly with the software axiovision™  to determine the values of anxa <dig> in the cell. the generate values varied from  <dig> to  <dig> arbitrary units.

anxa <dig> gene expression by lacz analysis
spatial and temporal activation of anxa <dig> gene promoter in lung was monitored with histochemical x-gal staining, as reported  <cit> , monitoring prussian blue precipitation as a marker of lacz gene activity  <cit> . briefly, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,  <dig>  m sodium phosphate buffer, ph  <dig> , for  <dig> h at 4°c, and washed in rinse buffer . samples were stained overnight at 37°c with  <dig> mm potassium ferricyanide and  <dig> mm potassium ferrocyanide in rinse buffer containing  <dig> mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside and 4% dimethylformamide. samples were then embedded in lr gold™ resin for subsequent microscopy analysis. as a negative control for the reaction, wild type lungs were incubated with x-gal staining. densitometric analysis for x-gal staining was performed densitometricaly with the software axiovision™  in lung leukocytes and epithelial cells. the values generated varied from  <dig> to  <dig> arbitrary units.

western blotting
lung from control or experimental groups of wild type mice were homogenized in edta free protease inhibitor . protein concentrations were determined by the bradford assay , mixed 1: <dig> with laemmli sample buffer  <cit> , and equal protein amounts  electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel in running buffer  followed by transfer of proteins onto hybond-c extra nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer . after membrane blocking with 5% non-fat milk solution in tbs containing  <dig> % tween  <dig>  anxa <dig> immunoreactivity was assessed using specific antibody to detect both cleaved  and intact protein  . the signal was amplified with hrp-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody  and visualized by ecl .

data handing and statistical analysis
in all cases data are reported as mean ± sem of five mice per group. statistical differences between groups were determined by anova followed, if significant, by the bonferroni test. in all cases, a probability value < <dig>  was taken as significant. the survival rate was analyzed using kaplan-meier cumulative plots, and comparisons between groups were performed using a log-rank test.

RESULTS
analysis of anxa <dig> protein expression and gene promoter activity in lung fibrosis
we began this study by monitoring anxa <dig> protein expression in wild type and gene promoter activity in anxa <dig> null mice, both in bronchiolar epithelial cells, circulating and migrated leukocytes. table  <dig> and  <dig> reports the cumulative data obtained from these densitometric analyses.

anxa <dig> protein expression was analyzed, as described in material and methods, in wild type mice lung at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-bleomycin i.t. administration. also a group of mice were daily i.p. treated or post-treated with the peptide ac2- <dig> as described in material and methods section. values  are mean ± sem of  <dig> histological tissue sections analyzed from five mice per group. * p <  <dig>  versus sham group values. # p <  <dig>  versus corresponding control group values. pmn, polymorphonuclear cells; mpc, monocyte/macrophages.

anxa <dig> null mice were treated with bleomycin  at time  <dig> and lung collected at the reported time points. x-gal staining was done as described in material and methods. values  are mean ± sem of  <dig> histological tissue sections analyzed from five mice per group. * p <  <dig>  versus sham group values. ** p <  <dig>  versus sham group values. *** p <  <dig>  versus sham group values.

as predicted  <cit> , immunohistochemistry revealed intracellular localization for anxa <dig> associated to gold particles in bronchiole epithelial cells , mononuclear phagocytic cell  and circulating polymorphonuclear  . all cells were positive for anxa <dig> under basal conditions . at day  <dig> post-bleomycin, an increment of anxa <dig> expression was observed in the bronchiolar epithelium , pmn and mpc of wild type mice ; this cellular response was no longer evident at day  <dig> . no immunogold staining could be detected in absence of the primary antibody , confirming the specificity of the anxa <dig> staining.

in lungs taken from sham mice , basal anxa <dig> gene promoter activity could be detected in the bronchiolar epithelium , pmn and mpc . this colorimetric reaction was markedly augmented at day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  post-bleomycin, with the epithelium and mpc resulting strongly positive at the later time-point. table  <dig> reports these data in quantitative fashion. as a control for these data, performing the x-gal staining protocols on lungs taken from wild type mice did not yield any coloration .

lack of anxa <dig> exacerbates inflammatory cell activation in lung fibrosis
the early response to bleomycin-induced fibrosis is characterized by a dramatic increase in inflammatory cell recruitment that precedes fibrotic tissue formation  <cit> . bleomycin administration induced marked leukocyte influx in wild type mice with no influx of blood cells being found in untreated mice . quantitative analysis of several histological lung sections of anxa <dig> null and wild type mice revealed rapid and intense leukocyte migration not only in peribronchial and perivascular areas but also in the interstitial space, occurring both at day  <dig> and  <dig> post-bleomycin . at day  <dig>  mice deficient in anxa <dig> displayed a higher degree of pmn and peripheral blood monocytes  adhesion to lung microvessels .

analysis of several tissue parameters was complemented by quantification of blood and bal total leukocyte numbers. in wild type mice, bleomycin administration caused marked leukocytosis at day  <dig>  with a high number of circulating pmn, pbmn and lymphocytes  being calculated . these profiles of circulating leukocyte subsets were mildly affected by absence of anxa1: a reduction in ly at day  <dig> as well as a less pronounced increase in pmn could be measured at day  <dig> . in parallel analyses, a rapid cells influx of blood-borne leukocyte into bal fluid was detected, with marked changes between wild type and anxa <dig> null mice especially for pmn , pbmc  and ly  .

histopathological and biochemical analysis of the lung
we then assessed the extent of pulmonary fibrosis in both genotypes, using the masson tri-chrome stain. administration of saline to either wild type or anxa <dig> null did not lead to abnormal deposition of collagen around the bronchiole, vessels or alveoli . in contrast, at day  <dig> post-bleomycin, wild type mice showed no significant increase in the connective tissue , with signs of severe fibrosis evident at day  <dig>  with greater destruction of alveolar architecture, more pronounced at perivascular and peribronchial sites . these changes were also evident in anxa <dig> null mice, both at  <dig> and  <dig> days post-bleomycin .

results obtained with the histopathological method were confirmed by measuring hydroxyproline content in lung tissue samples, to quantify the extent of collagen deposition. both wild type and anxa <dig> null bleomycin-treated mice had significantly higher fibrosis scores than saline-treated corresponding mice . moreover, there was a statistically significant difference  between wild type and anxa <dig> null bleomycin-treated mice, indicating induction of a higher degree of pulmonary fibrosis in the latter genotype .

bleomycin-induced fibrosis is lethal in anxa <dig> null mice
why the observation is surprising to observe that a proportion of anxa <dig> null mice succumbed during the time-course of these experiments, with a progressive incidence of lethality from day 7: at day  <dig> ~50% of bleomycin-treated mice had died . no lethality was observed in wild type animals up to the day  <dig> 

cytokine levels in bleomycin-induced fibrosis
it is accepted that tgf-β <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α are key cytokines in the fibrotic process of the lung initiated by bleomycin  <cit> . thus, we analyzed cytokine levels as a possible cause behind the increased signs of fibrosis and collagen accumulation detected in anxa <dig> null mice.

regulatory actions of peptide ac2-26
finally, we tested whether treatment of wild type mice with an anxa <dig> mimetic would affect the dramatic changes provoked by bleomycin in the lung. two protocols were used for administration of this peptide.

histological analyses showed that the peptide ac2- <dig> treatment reduced the extracellular deposition of collagen when compared to mice treated with bleomycin alone . in the group of mice treated with peptide ac2- <dig>  daily from day  <dig>  a clear reduction in connective tissue deposition around the bronchiolar epithelium was observed, with some similarity to the morphological structure of the sham group . similar protection of the lung was afforded when the peptide was administered between days  <dig> to  <dig> post-bleomycin, as determined by quantification of lung hydroxyproline content . a control group treated daily with peptide ac2- <dig> i.p., and given saline i.t., did not show significant morphological changes in the lung tissue .

treatment of mice with peptide ac2- <dig> led to an increased expression of endogenous anxa <dig> protein in the lung , when compared to bleomycin treatment alone . the changes provoked by peptide ac2- <dig> occurred in the alveolar macrophage and the epithelial cell and the expressions were higher than sham group  . western blotting analyses confirmed these histological results, showing augmented anxa <dig> in lung protein extracts prepared from mice treated with peptide ac2- <dig> over  <dig> days or only for the 14- <dig> day period, when compared to bleomycin-treated control mice . table  <dig> reports quantitative data associated with these analyses at single cell level.

discussion
pulmonary fibrosis has a complex etiology involving interactions among multiple cell types and intricate cytokine/chemokine networks. however, the precise role of any one of these cytokines in vivo is hard to identify in view of their pleiotropic biological activities. studies using animal models afford a well-defined means of addressing this problem since provide the opportunity to target each of these putative mediators using immunological and genetic approaches.

in line with the human fibrosis, the mechanisms underlying bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis are not fully understood, although several studies have identified expression of specific cytokines and mediators with potential functional role during this process. we propose here that investigation of the potential modulation of effectors of endogenous anti-inflammation could provide novel clues to harness the host response during lung fibrosis  <cit> . such a novel approach - exploiting the functions of homeostatic and tissue protective mediators - would possibly be more successful than blockade of the actions of pro-inflammatory mediators since anti-cytokine therapy has produced no improvement in lung function and, rather, seemed to be associated with harmful side effects  <cit> . few studies in humans and animals have demonstrated down regulation of one endogenous effector of resolution, the protein anxa <dig>  during the development of cystic fibrosis  <cit> ; the present study was intended to address, for the first time, the potential relevance of anxa <dig> in experimental fibrosis using the recently generated anxa <dig> null mouse  <cit> .

analysis of anxa <dig> protein expression in the bleomycin-induced fibrosis indicated increased expression in bronchial epithelial cells and leukocytes during the inflammatory phase  followed by a reduction during the fibrotic phase , as compared to sham animals: this event is in agreement with changes reported in lung tissue and leukocytes  <cit>  in experimental settings modeling tissue fibrosis.

we could monitor anxa <dig> gene promoter activity in leukocytes and epithelial cells using the anxa <dig> null mouse colony  <cit>  where a lacz gene reporter assay is inserted in frame. at day  <dig> post-bleomycin, the x-gal staining detected higher anxa <dig> gene promoter activity in leukocytes and epithelial cells compared to day  <dig> lung tissue samples. these data, together with the anxa <dig> protein expression, indicate that despite the lower levels of anxa <dig> detected in the cells, there is ample anxa <dig> gene promoter activity; we wish to postulate that reduction in anxa <dig> protein may be associated with a post-transcriptional mechanism which could perhaps lead to anxa <dig> proteolysis or leakage  from the cells. anxa <dig> lacks a signal peptide yet it is released from cells . several non-canonical secretory pathways have been ascribed, possibly in a cell specific fashion, including phosphorylation  <cit> , proteolysis  <cit> , granule/membrane fusion  <cit>  and microparticles release  <cit> . future studies will attempt to establish the 'preferred' mode of anxa <dig> secretion in activated lung cells, though it cannot be excluded that alternative mechanisms might be operating in diseased cells.

at day  <dig>  we could also measure a higher degree of fibrosis and collagen deposition in anxa <dig> null animals, as detected both morphologically and by hydroxyproline measurement. therefore, anxa <dig> down-regulation might be an important determinant during lung fibrosis development, suggesting that manipulation of local pulmonary concentration of anxa <dig>  perhaps by adenoviral delivery  can function as a negative regulator of cell growth. in pathology, anxa <dig> has been implicated directly or indirectly in tumor cell growth  <cit> . our previous results also showed an abnormal growth formation in the anxa <dig> null mice skull, probably caused by increased extracellular matrix and a delay in the bone mineralization  <cit> . thus, we would postulate that absence of anxa <dig> may lead to higher cell proliferation, increasing the extracellular matrix production and fibrosis formation. studies by nusrat's lab  <cit>  have identified anxa <dig> as a major effector of tissue protection following epithelial damage, an effect requiring externalization of the protein.

in our experimental conditions, absence of anxa <dig> affected several indices of the response promoted by bleomycin, characterized by an early inflammatory phase followed by the fibrotic process. the combined effect of anxa <dig> absence and bleomycin-induced fibrosis exceeded the sum of the effects of each factor alone on the severity of histological changes. this was visible because the higher degree of activation of circulating leukocyte and a remarkable leukocyte infiltration to the alveolar space and lung parenchyma; these cellular events led, or at least contribute, to: i) a more severe inflammatory response and ii) a greater destruction of alveolar architecture, pronounced in the perivascular and peribronchial areas. this effect is in line with our previous data in different experimental models of inflammation, including acute peritonitis  <cit>  and lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation  <cit> . absence of anxa <dig> is conducive to increased leukocyte infiltration leading to a more severe inflammatory reaction. several studies have associated inflammatory cell recruitment and lung damage with fibrosis formation  <cit> , prompting us to propose that alteration in the early protective role of anxa <dig> during the inflammatory phase could lead, downstream, to a higher degree of fibrosis.

so far we have two feasible mechanisms for explaining the impact of anxa <dig> in this model: i) direct alteration in the phenotype of lung cells potentially, but not necessarily, related to a ii) more aggressive inflammatory reaction. analysis of cytokine content favors a functional association between these two readouts. in fact, tightly coupled to the early inflammatory response is a higher cytokine expression. we measured tnf-α, tgf-β <dig> and ifn-γ since they instrumental for the inflammatory process and/or fibrosis  <cit> . in wild type mice, levels of these cytokines changed in the blood and bal fluid samples. tgf-β <dig> is largely responsible for fibroblast activation/differentiation, as well as collagen over-expression  <cit> . furthermore, a lower degree of parenchymal inflammation has been observed in ifn-γ deficient mice subjected to the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model  <cit> . in our samples we could determine a correlation between increased levels of tgf-β <dig> with tnf-α and ifn-γ up-regulation. hardie and collaborators  <cit>  showed that tgf-β <dig> conditional over-expression in epithelial cells, endothelial cells and macrophages induces fibrosis and tnf-α expression even in the absence of inflammation. it is plausible that complex positive loops might be activated locally, since tgf-β <dig> induction from macrophages occurs in a two-stage process requiring both tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> .

global absence of anxa <dig> resulted in dysregulated pulmonary levels of tnf-α, tgf-β <dig> and ifn-γ, more evident at day  <dig>  yet present also at day  <dig> post-bleomycin. this association of anxa <dig> with tnf-α expression is not totally unexpected as previously reported in a model of systemic endotoxemia induced by lps  <cit> . more studies will better address the molecular events behind anxa <dig> regulation of cytokine production in lung cells.

finally, we tested the potential pharmacological benefit of treatment of mice with peptide ac2- <dig>  this peptide mimics most  <cit> , if not all  <cit> , of the pharmacological actions of anxa <dig>  given daily over  <dig> days, or from day  <dig> to  <dig>  peptide ac2- <dig> reduced the most remarkable feature of the animal response to bleomycin, which is fibrosis, as quantified both histologically and by determination of lung hydroxyproline content.

an interesting observation stemmed from these experiments, that is the positive effect of treatment of mice with peptide ac2- <dig> on tissue levels of anxa <dig>  indicating that a positive loop might exist in anti-inflammation, whereby anxa <dig> activation of its receptor  would augment its own synthesis, in epithelial cells and in some leukocytes subsets . such a model is congruent with a recent study in mouse colitis, which revealed the ability of treatment with peptide ac2- <dig> to increase tissue mrna for anxa <dig> receptors  <cit> . the same held true for epithelial cells treated with anxa <dig>  <cit> . therefore, different studies are coming together with indications for the existence of this positive loop; if extended to other settings; this would indicate possible "auto-reactivity" of endogenous anti-inflammation and resolution, at least with respect to the anxa <dig> pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the striking phenotype we describe here indicates that endogenous and exogenous anxa <dig> affects selective aspects of the process of fibrosis development in the lung, a feature that may warrant further investigation on anxa <dig> biology in these experimental and pathological settings.
