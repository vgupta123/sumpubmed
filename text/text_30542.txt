BACKGROUND
the signaling of membrane surface receptors is regulated on a short-term basis by many different processes. among these processes are posttranslational covalent modifications of the receptor’s intracellular region, internalization of the receptor and its ligand followed by lysosomal degradation, and/or proteolytic processing induced by soluble or membrane-integrated proteases. this latter process has been studied in different membrane-integrated receptors that have a single-pass transmembrane region, such as the amyloid precursor protein , notch receptor, p75ntr neurotrophin receptor  and some members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family , including apolipoprotein e receptor  <dig> , megalin, and lrp <dig> . the proteolytic processing of the receptors involves two general steps: 1) cleavage, called shedding, in the juxtamembrane extracellular domain, which results in the formation of a carboxy terminal membrane-integrated polypeptide  and a soluble extracellular polypeptide , and 2) a second proteolysis event, carried out by the γ-secretase complex, at the transmembrane region of the membrane-integrated fragment, which produces two fragments, one of which corresponds to the intracellular domain  of the receptor  <cit> . in addition to regulating the half-life of the receptors, shedding and icd production are processes that facilitate receptor signaling. for example, in the p75ntr and notch signaling pathways, the generation of proteolytic fragments is crucial for the correct signaling processes  <cit> .

many studies have focused on the mechanisms associated with the regulation of proteolytic processing of signaling receptors to understand the contribution of shedding to the intracellular signaling pathways. neurotrophin receptors are among the principal study targets. the neurotrophins are trophic factors that act in the nervous system and regulate development and adult neuronal processes, such as neuronal survival or apoptosis  <cit> , the outgrowth or withdrawal of neurites  <cit> , maturation and differentiation of sensory neurons  <cit> , long-term depression   <cit> , and long-term potentiation   <cit> , among others  <cit> . neurotrophin receptors include the trk receptors . binding of neurotrophins to a trk receptor activates different signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase /akt pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway , and the phospholipase c-γ pathway  <cit> . nerve growth factor  binds to trka  <cit> , brain-derived neurotrophic factor  binds to trkb  <cit> , and neurotrophin  <dig>  binds to trkc  <cit> .

the neurotrophin receptor p75ntr, a member of the tumor necrosis factor  receptor superfamily, binds to all the neurotrophins with the same affinity, unlike the trk receptors  <cit> . p75ntr, along with its ligands, induces the regulation of intracellular pathways, including the activation of the c-jun n-terminal kinase  pathway  <cit> , the regulation of the nf-κb transcription factor  <cit> , and the modulation of rhoa gtpase activity  <cit> . in the nervous system, p75ntr has a role in neuronal apoptosis during nervous system development  <cit>  and axon growth inhibition mediated by myelin and its interaction with the nogo receptor, ngr <dig>  and lingo- <dig>  which results in the activation of rhoa  <cit> . furthermore, when p75ntr is co-expressed in neurons along with the trk receptors, the apoptosis induced by p75ntr signaling is abolished, and trk receptor signaling is potentiated . many of the functions of p75ntr in neurons are dependent on receptor proteolysis . in pc <dig> cells, activation of trka by ngf induces the proteolytic processing of p75ntr, resulting in the accumulation of the p75ntr ctf and also its icd  <cit> . furthermore, shedding of p75ntr induced by ngf is mediated by the metalloprotease adam <dig> , a process that facilitates ngf-trka signaling by stimulating the pi3k/akt and mapk/erk pathways  <cit> . similarly, in cerebellar granule neurons, the expression of p75ntr facilitates akt activation in response to the activation of trkb by bdnf  <cit> . another signaling process of p75ntr that is mediated by proteolytic processing of the receptor is the apoptosis of sensory neurons. in these neurons, activation of the apoptotic pathway requires the production of the p75ntr icd and the activation of the jnk pathway  <cit> .

another family of receptors expressed in the nervous system and related to brain development and adult neuronal functions is the ldlr family. two receptors belonging to this family, apoer <dig> and very low density lipoprotein receptor , together with their ligand reelin, are key components of the brain machinery involved in neuronal migration and positioning during brain development  <cit> . in this stage, reelin expressed by cajal-retzius cells  <cit>  facilitates the correct development of different regions of the cns, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex . in the adult stage, the functions of apoer <dig> and its ligand reelin include the regulation of synaptic plasticity  <cit> , dendritic branching  <cit> , actin remodeling  <cit> , growth cone motility, filopodia formation  <cit> , and neuronal survival  <cit> .

reelin is an extracellular matrix protein that binds to apoer <dig> and vldlr, triggering the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways  <cit>  including the interaction between the dab <dig> adaptor with the cytoplasmic region of the receptors  <cit> . additionally, dab <dig> is phosphorylated by the src family of kinases  , facilitating the activation of pi3k/akt pathway  <cit> . pi3k regulates downstream effectors that are associated with cytoskeleton dynamics, such as cofilin  <cit>  and tau  <cit> . like many surface receptors, apoer <dig> signaling is regulated through lysosomal degradation after ligand binding and internalization  <cit> . furthermore, as a result of the interaction between apoer <dig> and its ligand, the receptor levels are downregulated by shedding  <cit> , resulting in the production of the extracellular domain of the receptor and the carboxy-terminal fragment , which is the substrate of the γ-secretase complex. other ligands of apoer <dig>  such as apolipoprotein e, alpha- <dig> macroglobulin  and f-spondin, also induce the proteolysis of the receptor  <cit> . however, there are few studies of the cellular mechanisms involved in the proteolysis of apoer <dig> and the functional consequences that this process brings to the cells.

both the reelin-apoer <dig> and the neurotrophin signaling systems are expressed in neurons of the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex  and share functions associated with brain development and adult neuronal functions, including participation in some pathological conditions such as schizophrenia  <cit> . moreover, the signaling machineries associated with both types of receptors share intracellular signaling molecules with the pi3k/akt pathway. interestingly, there is little direct evidence of crosstalk between these two signaling receptor families. however, ligand binding to lrp <dig>  a member of ldlr family, transactivates the trk receptors through an sfk-dependent pathway in pc <dig> cells and neurons  <cit> , demonstrating that apolipoprotein e-receptors have neurotrophic activity that is dependent on trk receptor transactivation.

the aim of this study was to determine whether the activation of the trk receptors by neurotrophins regulates shedding of apoer <dig>  we demonstrated that ngf regulates the proteolysis of apoer <dig> in pc <dig> cells and that this process is dependent on trka signaling. in this model, we also demonstrated the participation of two signaling pathways in the constitutive shedding of apoer2: the mapk/erk and pi3k/akt pathways. in contrast, reelin was not able to induce shedding of p75ntr. finally, modulation of apoer <dig> proteolysis was also identified in primary cultures of cortical neurons, in which bdnf also induced the shedding of apoer <dig> 

RESULTS
pc <dig> cells stably expressing apoer <dig> respond to ngf and reelin
pc <dig> cells have been widely used to study the neurotrophin signaling pathways and their cellular functions. pc <dig> cells endogenously express trka and p75ntr and, in response to the exogenous ngf, differentiate into a “neuronal cell phenotype” similar to sympathetic neurons found in the pns  <cit> . however, pc <dig> cells do not express high quantities of apoer <dig>  therefore, to study the proteolysis of apoer <dig>  we generated stably transfected pc <dig> cells expressing the human full-length apoer <dig> carrying an ha-tag at its n-terminus  . western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes the intracellular region of apoer <dig> confirmed the expression of both the glycosylated  and unglycosylated  forms in cells transfected with the full-length receptor; additionally, some fragments of lower molecular weight, which represent proteolysis products, were also identified . the receptor was localized throughout the cell, including the tips of the neurites in ngf-differentiated cells, as determined via detection of the ha epitope by immunofluorescence . apoer <dig> transfected cells also responded to ngf by activation of akt .figure  <dig>

pc <dig> cells that express ha-apoer <dig> were activated by ngf in a similar way as the control cells  . it is known that the apoer <dig> ligand reelin induces neurite outgrowth in hippocampal and cortical neurons  <cit> . by pcr and by western blot, we confirmed the expression of the adaptor protein dab <dig>  which is required for the reelin canonical signaling pathway in pc <dig> cells . in addition, we found that pc <dig> cells expressing apoer <dig> respond to reelin; first, when they were treated with reelin-conditioned medium for 30 min it was possible to evidence the phosphorylation of dab <dig>  and second, the cells showed evident neurite extension after 48 h of incubation time with the ligand, . wild-type pc <dig> cells did not respond significantly to reelin , as expected from cells with low expression of endogenous apoer <dig> figure  <dig> 
apoer <dig> expression does not affect pc <dig> differentiation or responses to neurotrophin.  differentiation of the pc <dig> control  compared to cells stably expressing ha-apoer <dig> with ngf  for 48 h. in both conditions, the cells were able to differentiate and extend neurites.  pcr showing the expression of dab <dig> in total brain, embryonic cortical neurons, and both differentiated and undifferentiated pc <dig> cells stably expressing apoer <dig>   pc <dig> expressing ha-apoer <dig> cell were incubated with reelin-conditioned media or mock-conditioned media  for 30 min. cells were lysed and the presence of total and phosphorylated dab <dig> was detected by inmunoblot; α-tubulin is shown as a loading control.  the presence of apoer <dig> in pc <dig> cells makes them responsive to reelin-conditioned media , as assessed by neurite extension.



ngf induces the proteolytic processing of apoer <dig> in pc <dig> cells via trka
wild type pc <dig> cells have been previously used to study the mechanisms involved in the regulation of p75ntr proteolytic processing induced by ngf  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether this process operates in a similar way in the pc <dig> cells stably expressing ha-apoer <dig>  cells were incubated with different pharmacological inhibitors, and the effects of the drugs on the proteolysis of p75ntf were analyzed. inhibiting the γ-secretase complex dapt, which has been used to study the proteolysis of app, notch, and apoer <dig>  among others substrates, induced the accumulation of the ctf of p75ntr, thus corroborating the participation of the γ-secretase complex in the proteolysis of p75ntr . furthermore, incubating the cells with ngf for 2 hours induced an increase in the ctf levels, as shown previously, indicating that ngf regulates the proteolysis of p75ntr in our cell system. the proteolysis of p75ntr was prevented by pre-incubating the cells for 1 h with k252a, an inhibitor of trk tyrosine kinase activity, thus supporting the role of trka in this process  <cit> . it is known that the shedding of p75ntr induced by ngf is mediated by adam <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, when cells were pre-treated with gm <dig>  a broad spectrum inhibitor of the proteases belonging to the metalloproteinases family, the effect of ngf on p75ntr proteolysis was almost completely suppressed. these results show that pc <dig> cells stably expressing ha-apoer <dig> respond to trka-ngf signaling and regulate p75ntr proteolysis, just as the wild type pc <dig> cells  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
ngf induces the proteolytic processing of apoer <dig>   serum-starved pc12-apoer <dig> cells were pre-treated with 10 μm dapt , 50 μm gm <dig>  and/or  <dig> nm k252a  for 1 h and then incubated with 100 ng/ml ngf for 2 h. the blot shows full-length p75ntr, p75ntr ctf, and α-tubulin as a loading control. as described  <cit> , ngf induced the proteolysis of p75ntr and, thus, the accumulation of the ctf. this process depends on trka tyrosine kinase activity and the metalloproteinases.  cells were pre-treated with 10 μm dapt for 1 h and then incubated with 100 ng/ml ngf for 2 h. apoer <dig> and the proteolytic fragment apoer2-ctf were recognized using antibodies against the intracellular region of the receptor. α-tubulin is shown as a loading control.  quantification of blot levels of apoer2-ctf normalized to the loading control α-tubulin and plotted as the average ± sd of four independent experiments. student’s t-test, **p <  <dig> .  pc12-apoer <dig> was treated as previously described and then incubated with 100 ng/ml ngf for different times . cell lysates were used for protein detection by western blot analysis. akt phosphorylation is observed immediately after the addition of ngf. as well as the apparition of p75ntr ctf. α-tubulin is shown as a loading control.  quantification of blot levels of apoer2-ctf normalized to the loading control α-tubulin and plotted as the average ± sd of three independent experiments.



pc12-apoer <dig> cells that were incubated with dapt accumulated the apoer <dig> 17 kda ctf, as has been previously described in other cell types, which supports the constitutive proteolytic processing of apoer <dig>  <cit>  . pc12-apoer <dig> cells that were incubated with ngf for 2 h showed a significant increase in the ctf level . similarly, pc12-apoer <dig> cells displayed a gradual increase in the ctf level when they were incubated for different times with the neurotrophin, which evident already from 10 minutes of treatment . this observation indicates that the proteolytic processing of apoer <dig> is regulated by ngf. as a positive control for ngf activity, we determined the proteolysis of p75ntr and the phosphorylation of akt.

the fact that ngf binds to the trka receptor as well as p75ntr led us to investigate which of the receptors is involved in the regulated proteolysis of apoer <dig> induced by ngf. pre-treatment of pc12-apoer <dig> cells with k252a abolished the akt phosphorylation induced by ngf and also abrogated the increase in apoer2-ctf levels induced by the neurotrophin . this result demonstrates that the regulated proteolysis of apoer <dig> depends on trka activity and not on p75ntr signaling.figure  <dig> 
apoer <dig> proteolysis induced by ngf depends on trka tyrosine kinase activity and on metalloproteinase activity. pc12-apoer <dig> cells were serum-starved and pre-treated with 10 μm dapt and   <dig> nm k252a or  with 50 μm gm <dig> for 1 h. then, the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml ngf for 2 h. apoer <dig>  apoer2-ctf and the proteolytic fragment of p75ntr  were determined by western blot analysis using antibodies directed against their intracellular regions. α-tubulin is shown as a loading control, and the phosphorylated form of akt is a control for trka activation by ngf.  the levels of apoer <dig> ctf were normalized to the loading control α-tubulin and plotted as the average ± sd of three independent experiments. one way anova, holm-sidak post-hoc test, **p <  <dig> ; *p <  <dig> .



metalloproteinases of the adam family regulate the shedding of apoer <dig> induced by ngf
regulated proteolysis of many receptors, including p75ntr and apoer <dig>  is achieved by metalloproteinases  <cit> . when pc <dig> cells were incubated with a general inhibitor of metalloproteinases of the adam family  1 h prior to the addition of ngf, receptor proteolysis was significantly decreased . therefore, this family of proteases is not only involved in p75ntr shedding  but also regulates the ngf-induced proteolytic processing of apoer <dig> 

mapk/erk signaling pathway mediates p75ntr but not apoer <dig> proteolysis induced by ngf
among the signaling pathways activated by ngf is the mapk/erk signaling pathway, which has been shown to regulate the proteolysis of p75ntr
 <cit> . therefore, to further analyze the mechanisms involved in the ngf-induced proteolysis of apoer <dig>  pc <dig> cells were incubated with pd <dig>  an inhibitor of the erk1/ <dig> signaling pathway that controls mek1/ <dig> activity. surprisingly, cells under this treatment displayed an increase in apoer <dig> ctf levels, demonstrating that, under basal  conditions, this mapk/erk signaling pathway downregulates the shedding of apoer <dig> . however, pc <dig> cells that were incubated with ngf in addition to the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor still showed an increase in the levels of apoer <dig> ctf in response to the neurotrophin  that was significantly higher than the ctf levels observed under basal mek1/ <dig> inhibition conditions. these results indicate that the mapk/erk signaling pathway is not involved in the proteolysis of apoer <dig> induced by ngf. in contrast, the proteolysis of p75ntr was dependent on the mapk/erk signaling pathway . therefore, although ngf stimulates the shedding of p75ntr and apoer <dig>  the signaling pathways involved in the proteolytic processing of the two receptors are different.figure  <dig>

 pc12-apoer <dig> cells were serum-starved and pre-treated with 10 μm dapt and 25 μm pd <dig> for 1 h. then, the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml ngf for 2 h. apoer <dig> and the proteolytic control p75ntr were recognized by western blotting using antibodies directed against their intracellular regions. the activation of mek1/ <dig> by ngf was evidenced by recognition of phospho-erk. α-tubulin is shown as a loading control. the blot levels of apoer <dig> ctf  and p75ntr ctf  were normalized to the loading control α-tubulin and plotted as the average ± sd of three independent experiments. one way anova, holm-sidak post-hoc test, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , n.s, not significant.



pi3k activity reduces apoer <dig> basal proteolysis but is not required for the ngf-induced processing
another signaling pathway that is activated in response to ngf is the pi3k signaling pathway. this pathway is also activated by apoer <dig> in response to its ligand reelin. furthermore, this signaling pathway is known to mediate, among several effects, neuronal survival through the regulation of the apoptotic machinery  <cit> . to address the role of pi3k in the ngf-induced processing of apoer <dig>  pc <dig> cells were incubated with different pi3k inhibitors. two pan-class i/ii/iii pi3k inhibitors , ly  <dig>  and wortmannin  as well as the class i/ii pi3k inhibitor , that does not affects class iii pi3k   <cit>  were used and the apoer <dig> and p75ntr ctf levels were analysed by western blot . under basal conditions  the ctf levels of both receptors were significantly increased following inhibitors treatment, indicating pi3k activity decreases the levels of the proteolytic fragments of the receptors . because all the inhibitors tested had the same effects, this suggests the possible involvement of class i/ii and not class iii pi3k. on the other hand, the ngf-induced processing of apoer <dig> was not decreased when pi3k was inhibited; moreover the ctfs production was significantly increased under this condition, indicating that the machinery involved in the ngf-induced processing is not dependent on the activation of pi3k. in the same direction, the proteolysis of p75ntr induced by ngf was not abolished, when pi3k activity was inhibited.figure  <dig> 
pi3k activity regulates the constitutive levels of apoer <dig> ctf but is not involved in apoer <dig> shedding induced by ngf.  pc12-apoer <dig> cells were serum-starved and pre-treated with 10 μm dapt and 50 μm ly <dig> or 5 μm zstk <dig> for 1 h. then, the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml ngf for 2 h. apoer <dig> and p75ntr were recognized using antibodies directed against their intracellular regions. the activation of pi3k, induced by ngf, was determined by detection of phospho-akt. α-tubulin is shown as a loading control. the blot levels of apoer <dig> ctf  and of p75ntr ctf  were normalized to the loading control α-tubulin and plotted as the average ± sd of three independent experiments. one way anova, holm-sidak post-hoc test, *p <  <dig> ; n.s, not significant.



apoer <dig> proteolytic processing in cortical neurons
to further study the connection between apoer <dig> and the neurotrophin system, we searched for potential cross-talk between the pathways in cultured rat embryonic cortical neurons that are known to express both apoer <dig> and the trkb receptor. upon activation with bdnf, a trkb ligand, cortical neurons responded with an increase in akt phosphorylation . apoer <dig> was detected in these neurons by immunofluorescence  and by western blot analysis as a full-length protein as well as its 17-kda ctf . furthermore, this low molecular weight fragment accumulated after treatment with dapt , which indicates that the γ-secretase complex, as expected, participates in the basal processing of apoer2-ctf in cortical neurons. when dapt-pre-treated neurons were subsequently incubated with bdnf for 5 h, the levels of the apoer <dig> ctf significantly increased , thus strengthening the data obtained in pc <dig> cells expressing ha-apoer <dig> regarding the role of neurotrophins in receptor shedding.figure  <dig>

reelin regulates apoer <dig> degradation and proteolysis but not of p75
reelin downregulates the protein levels of apoer <dig>  inducing both proteolytic processing  <cit>  and lysosomal degradation  <cit> . when pc <dig> ha-apoer <dig> cells were treated with reelin, the levels of the mature form of the receptor decreased . moreover, reelin induced the accumulation of the ctf of apoer <dig>  thus corroborating the role of this ligand in the proteolysis of apoer <dig> . to investigate crosstalk between the neurotrophin family and the reelin-apoer <dig> system, we analyzed the levels of full-length p75ntr and the ctf of p75ntr after treatment with reelin for 2 h. the results indicated that, under this experimental condition, reelin does not affect the normal degradation of p75ntr .figure  <dig>

discussion
the nervous system works as a complex network in which the neurons are the primary components. many studies have shown the involvement of diverse signaling pathways both in the development of the nervous system and during adult stages. for example, the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in neurons are crucial for the correct functioning of the cns and pns  <cit> . similarly, reelin and its receptor apoer <dig> participate in neuronal processes during development and in adulthood  <cit> . however, despite the large number of studies that have been conducted in neurons and the discovery of an enormous number of proteins involved in signaling, less is known about the connections between the different signaling systems functioning in the brain.

based on reports showing that the neurotrophin and reelin signaling pathways share common intracellular effectors and that the receptors of both families are regulated by proteolytic processing, we studied whether crosstalk may exist between these two systems at the level of the regulation of proteolysis. as it was reported previously, p75ntr proteolysis is regulated by the activation of trka receptor. until now, there was no evidence of the regulation of other proteolytic processes involving trk activation. in this work, we found that the activation of trka by ngf induced the proteolysis of apoer <dig>  specifically affecting the shedding of the receptor and resulting in the accumulation of its ctf. these results demonstrate a connection between the neurotrophin system and the reelin pathway. similar to the shedding of p75ntr the trka-regulated proteolysis of apoer <dig> was dependent on the metalloproteinases of the adam family. although we did not identify the metalloproteinase involved in the shedding of apoer <dig>  the participation of the membrane integrated metalloproteinase adam <dig> has been described in the proteolysis of p75ntr induced by ngf  <cit> .

the shedding of p75ntr induced by ngf in pc <dig> cells is dependent on mek1/ <dig> activity  <cit>  and our data supported this finding. the activation of the mapk/erk pathway promotes the phosphorylation of adam <dig>  <cit> . the phosphorylation of adam <dig> in the intracellular region  is known to affect its intracellular localization, increase its concentration at the cell surface, and facilitate its maturation  <cit> . moreover, the proteolysis of p75ntr induced by ngf is dependent on the phosphorylation of threonine  <dig> of adam <dig>  <cit> . however, while kommaddi et al. showed that ngf stimulates adam <dig> phosphorylation, they did not observe a change in the surface levels of the metalloproteinase. furthermore, activation of this signaling pathway is known not only to modulate the surface levels of the metalloproteinase but also to shift the balance from adam <dig> dimers to monomers. this process stimulates the dissociation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- <dig>  from adam <dig>  thus activating the metalloproteinase  <cit> . previous studies have shown that timp <dig> decreases the level of apoer2-soluble extracellular fragments and ctfs, suggesting an active role for α-secretase in the first step of apoer <dig> processing at the plasma membrane  <cit> . in contrast, apoer <dig> proteolysis induced by ngf was not dependent on mek/erk activation, which is the first difference between the regulated proteolysis of apoer <dig> and p75ntr. this result suggests that the proteolysis of apoer <dig> induced by ngf may be mediated by metalloproteinases other than adam <dig>  surprisingly, under basal conditions, our results show that mek activity decreases the levels of the apoer <dig> ctf, contrary to what is known about the regulation of adam <dig> activity on different substrates  <cit> . this result therefore strengthens the idea that other metalloproteinases participate in the shedding of apoer <dig> under these conditions.

the pi3k/akt pathway in neurons is another signaling pathway that is activated in response to ngf, and its activation is dependent on trka activity. the pi3-kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositols , a family of minority lipids present in the cytosolic side of cell membranes. many of the products of pi3k p <dig>  ptdinsp <dig>  and ptdinsp3) function in specific regions of the cell to recruit various proteins involved in protein trafficking and signaling  <cit> . our results demonstrate that inhibiting the basal activity of pi3k via the pan-class i/ii/iii pi3k inhibitor ly  <dig> as well as the class i/ii pi3k inhibitor zstk <dig>  <cit>  under a condition in which the activity of the γ-secretase complex is inhibited with dapt, results in a significant accumulation of the proteolytic fragments of apoer <dig>  many studies have shown the importance of pi3k in the trafficking of cell surface receptors through the endocytic pathway. for example, the transferrin receptor and receptors belonging to the ldlr family  display impaired trafficking via the endocytic compartments after treatment with wortmannin  <cit>  a covalent pan-class i/ii/iii pi3k inhibitor. specifically, the receptors accumulate in early endosomes and are prevented from progressing to late endosomes, which affects their lysosomal degradation, and also display impaired recycling to the cell surface. therefore, the observed increase in the levels the ctf of apoer <dig>  when pi3k activity is inhibited could be due to an increase in receptor shedding and/or reduced ctf degradation, by a γ-secretase independent pathway. similarly to what we found for mek/erk activation, apoer <dig> proteolysis induced by ngf was not dependent on pi3k activation. thus, we suggest that the ngf-regulated proteolysis of apoer <dig> does not depend on pi3k activity, in the same way of what was observed for p75ntr.

our results using cultures of primary cortical neurons demonstrate a connection between neurotrophin signaling and the proteolysis of endogenous apoer <dig>  the levels of apoer2-ctf were regulated by bdnf, thus reinforcing the results obtained in pc <dig> cells. our data, together with previous studies in neurons that show common functions and intracellular pathways between the neurotrophin and reelin-apoer <dig> systems, suggest that these two families may be coordinated to regulate neuronal functions both during development and under different physiological conditions in the adult brain. a recent report indicated a genetic interaction between reelin and bdnf that is dependent on the sex hormones  <cit> . moreover, the actions of bdnf in cajal-retzius cells during development decrease the expression of reelin  <cit> , while the mrna expression of vldlr, the other reelin receptor, increases through trkb  <cit> . furthermore the reeler mouse, which lacks reelin, has significantly decreased bdnf levels along with lower trkb activity  <cit> . in addition, mice devoid of bdnf during development have significantly increased reelin levels  <cit> . interestingly, the intracellular fragment of apoer <dig> generated by the activity of the γ-secretase complex, the apoer2-icd, can inhibit the expression of reelin at the transcriptional level  <cit> . therefore, the documented reduction of reelin induced by bdnf  <cit>  could be dependent, at least in part, on the neurotrophin- induced proteolysis of apoer <dig>  as reported in our work. overall, these data suggest a functional relationship between these two systems that may be relevant for pathological conditions such as schizophrenia  and autism .

apoer <dig> is an endocytic receptor that follows the degradative pathway to the lysosomes in response to reelin binding  <cit> . reelin also induces the proteolytic processing of the receptor by a still unknown mechanism  <cit> . when pc <dig> cells were treated with reelin and dapt, the levels of mature apoer <dig> decreased, and the ctf of the receptor accumulated. therefore, in our cell model, receptor degradation is stimulated by its ligand. reelin was also able to induce neurite outgrowth in pc <dig> cells expressing apoer <dig>  but it did not affect the levels of p75ntr or its ctf. these results indicate that, in contrast to the effect of ngf on apoer <dig> processing, reelin signaling does not regulate the functionality of p75ntr or the formation of its fragments. however, we could not discount that the processing of p75ntr could be affected by reelin in a different cellular context because the levels of p75ntr in our cortical neurons were too low to be detected as proteolytic fragments.

to date, little is known about the function of the proteolytic fragments of apoer <dig>  there are studies showing that the extracellular fragment of apoer <dig> produced after shedding have the ability to interact with ligands found in the extracellular medium  <cit> . additionally, the apoer2-icd can translocate to the nucleus  <cit>  where, as mentioned before, it may be able to inhibit reelin transcription  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
even though the signaling pathway regulating apoer <dig> shedding, induced by neurotrophins, was different than the one described for p75ntr in terms of the participation of mek1/ <dig> activity, our study clearly gives new insights into the crosstalk between neurotrophins and the reelin receptors, specifically through the activation of apoer <dig> shedding by the trk receptors. in contrast, the apoer2/reelin pathway would not regulate p75ntr in terms in its proteolytic processing.

further studies are required to understand the cellular role of the neurotrophin-induced apoer <dig> processing in neurons. plausible functions of apoer <dig> processing, induced by its own ligand and/or by neurotrophin signaling, could be involved in fine-tuning the regulation of the reelin signaling cascade that should occur at the synapse and/or during neuronal migration.
