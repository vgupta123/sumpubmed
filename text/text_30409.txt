BACKGROUND
an increasing number of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors have recently been developed on the basis of gfp-like proteins  <cit> . however, currently available genetically encoded sensors are characterized by low signal intensity and limited dynamic range   <cit> , insufficient for routine applications in high throughput screening  assays and restricting sensitivity of precise single-cell studies. at the same time, genetically encoded sensors provide a much wider flexibility, allowing to be targeted to any chosen cellular compartment, to generate stable cell lines and transgenic animals, to be expressed in a particular tissue and/or in a temporally controlled manner under a specific promoter. therefore, development of genetically encoded sensors characterized by increased dynamic range and signal intensity remains an actual task.

one of the most promising approaches to create genetically encoded sensors is based on the circularly permuted fluorescent protein  fused to or inserted into sensitive domain  <cit> . in the presence of an analyte or in response to a cellular event, sensitive domain undergoe structural rearrangements, inducing conformational changes of cpfp and resulting in its altered fluorescent properties. circular permutation allows placing sensitive domains in a close proximity to the chromophore environment of cpfp within chimeric sensor construct. therefore, conformational changes of the sensitive domains and their influence on the spectral properties of cpfp is direct and can lead to significant changes in the fluorescent signal.

in particular, such ca2+ sensors as gcamps  <cit>  and pericams  <cit>  were constructed by fusing calmodulin and its target peptide m <dig>  to cpfp. in the presence of ca2+, calmodulin binds to the m <dig> peptide, causing conformational changes in the vicinity of the chromophore and thereby influencing cpfp fluorescence. similar sensors, named camgaroos  <cit> , are formally based on the non-permuted gfp, but contain an inserted calmodulin molecule at position tyr <dig> of eyfp, which is essentially similar to the circular permutation approach.

in most cases, it was shown that spectral changes of the cpfp-based sensors fluorescence occur through the chromophore transition from the neutral  to the charged  form. noteworthy, the same mechanism leads to 100– <dig> fold increase of green fluorescence after photoactivation of so called photoactivatable fluorescent proteins, pa-gfp  <cit>  and ps-cfp  <cit> . this indicates that potentially the same dynamic ranges may be achieved for the cpfp-based fluorescent sensors, provided that the amino acid residues surrounding the chromophore are adapted properly and the conformational changes of the sensitive domains cause favorable conformational alterations in cpfp.

here we describe the development of high dynamic range cpfp-based ca2+ sensors, that show up to  <dig> -fold increase of the fluorescent signal  in response to ca2+. these sensors are more ph stable compared to flash-pericam  <cit>  and gcamp <dig>   <cit>  and have approximately 3-fold higher dynamic range compared to gcamps  <cit> . we believe that the "fluorescent core" of the sensors reported herein may be employed to develop sensors of various specificity with increased dynamic range, allowing reliable quantitative analyses of cellular signaling pathways.

RESULTS
 <dig>  analyzing the break point
first we compared the break points of circular permutation within the β-barrel of fluorescent proteins used in pericams and gcamps ca2+ sensors . remarkably, amino acid residues corresponding to the positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the intact aequorea victoria gfp   were shown to substantially determine the fluorescent properties of the sensors  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that in pericams and gcamps the amino acid residues  <dig> and  <dig> are in a close proximity to the chromophore, similarly to the native avgfp   <cit> . the amino acid residue preceding position  <dig> and the one following position  <dig> should be the outermost within the cpfp beta-barrel . it can be presumed that the positional relationship of these key amino acid residues and the sensitive domains is common for the sensors described in refs.  <cit>  and this family of circularly permuted variants can be generally named cpfp147- <dig>  a similar spatial organization can be proposed for the camgaroo sensors  <cit> .

 <dig>  adapting the chromophore environment within a ca2+ sensor
looking for the sensor variants with expanded dynamic range, we generated a set of ca2+ sensor constructs which varied at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  in gcamps and pericams position  <dig> was either gly or thr . we presumed that two other amino acid residues with rather compact side chains, ser and ala, wouldn't cause spatial conflict at position  <dig>  while they would alter the spectral properties of the sensor. using site-directed mutagenesis, we ntroduced either ser, ala or thr in position  <dig>  in combination with asp <dig> , glu <dig> , or asn <dig>  the overall sensors design was similar to that of gcamps. we used m <dig> peptide, a calmodulin domain and linkers lengths identical to those reported for gcamp <dig>  <cit> , combined with cpfp described in ref.  <cit>  and originating from ratiometric pericam  <cit> . importantly, all our sensor variants carried phe at position  <dig>  which was earlier shown to influence the fluorescent properties of cpfp-based indicators  <cit> .

our sensor variants and their responses to ca2+ are summarized in table 1b. indeed, the variation at positions  <dig> and  <dig> was shown to determine sensor characteristics to a large extent. analogously to ratiometric pericam , combination of asp <dig> and phe <dig> resulted in dual-excitation spectrum  and strong ratiometric response to ca2+ when coupled with ala <dig> or ser <dig>  however, combination asp148/phe203/thr <dig> resulted in poorly responding sensor.

at the same time, all variants carrying asn <dig> or glu <dig> showed a single  <dig> nm excitation peak. while asn148-containing sensors demonstrated low dynamic ranges, combinations glu148/thr <dig>  and glu148/ser <dig> ) resulted in high dynamic range sensors with up to  <dig> -fold increase of  <dig> nm excited green fluorescence in response to  <dig> mm ca2+. further, cps <dig> was optimized in respect of folding at 37°c using random mutagenesis approach, resulting in an enhanced variant with 12-fold fluorescence increase in response to ca2+, named case <dig>  this variant was characterized by a fast maturation and high brightness and was chosen for further tests in living cells. site directed mutagenesis t145s of case <dig> resulted in a sensor named case <dig>  which was characterized by the highest dynamic range, with up to  <dig> -fold fluorescence increase in response to ca2+ , though less effective maturation in e. coli.

 <dig>  characterization of case <dig> and case <dig> in vitro
spectral properties of case <dig> and case <dig> are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  both sensors demonstrated record multi-fold increase of green fluorescent signal in response to  <dig> mm ca2+ . changes in the absorbance spectra in response to ca2+  were quite predictable from the observed fluorescence changes and reflected the redistribution between neutral and charged states of the chromophore in favor of the latter one. similar responses, although with lower dynamic ranges, were reported earlier for flash-pericam  <cit>  and camgaroo  <cit>  sensors. importantly, maximum brightness  reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  of that of egfp for case <dig> and case <dig>  respectively, which is essentially higher than that of flash-pericam or gcamp <dig>  and comparable to gcamp <dig> .

a calculated brightness compared to that of egfp.

the common weak point of cpfp-based sensors is their low ph stability. for example, pka  for pericams ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . therefore, at physiological ranges of ph  such sensors exhibit lower brightness and dynamic range  <cit> . in contrast, the pka values of case <dig> and case <dig> were shown to be  <dig>   close to that reported for gcamp <dig> . therefore, case <dig> and case <dig> are characterized by notably higher ph-stability compared to gcamp <dig>  or pericams .

further we measured case <dig> and case <dig> kd values for ca2+ binding at ph  <dig> , using molecular probes assay . the apparent kd was found to be  <dig> μm for both sensors , which lies within the physiological range of ca2+ concentrations. in most eukaryotic cells the free ca2+ concentration rests at approximately 100– <dig> nm and following activation of cellular signaling pathways cytosolic ca2+ levels are elevated up to several μm  <cit> .

 <dig>  characterization of case <dig> and case <dig> in living cells
first, we checked maximum fluorescence response for both sensors in living hela cells. for this purpose the sensors were cloned into the n-vector , driving gene expression in eukaryotic cells. cells transfected with case <dig> sensor variant demonstrated relatively weak green fluorescence, which could be detected under a fitc filter set or upon excitation with a  <dig> nm laser line, emission collected at 500– <dig> nm . addition of  <dig> μm ca2+ ionophore a <dig>  allowing ca2+  to enter cells, typically resulted in 5–6-fold increase in green fluorescence brightness. further addition of  <dig> mm egta removed ca2+ and decreased the fluorescence signal close to baseline level, with the final contrast of 11–12-fold. very similar results with 7– <dig> fold increase in the presence of ionophore and the final contrast of 13– <dig> fold were obtained for case <dig> . in analogues experiments with gcamp <dig>  one of the best reported cpfp-based ca2+ sensors  <cit>  , the corresponding contrasts were  <dig> -fold increase in the presence of ionophore and 5-fold decrease after addition of egta, corresponding with the reported dynamic range  <cit> .

further we tested the response of the sensors to the less pronounced ca2+ changes under physiological conditions. m <dig> human melanoma cells expressing case <dig> displayed a nice high dynamic range response to atp at a final concentration of  <dig> μm . this experiment clearly showed that case <dig> fluorescence response to ca2+ oscillations is fast and reversible. it also demonstrated that the sensor responds to changes in ca2+ concentration in living cells in the nanomolar range.

in another experimental set-up, we monitored ca2+ responses in pc <dig> cells. transfected cells were grown at 37°c and ngf  was added  <dig> hours before the experiment in order to induce differentiation. in the course of imaging, cells were perfused with carbogen-saturated acsf   <cit>  within a 34°c chamber. figure 3i shows the ca2+ response of case <dig> sensor to carbachol . after  <dig> min of wash,  <dig> mm kcl was added to the same cells .

further we compared ca2+ responses of case <dig>  case <dig> and a well-known chemical probe for ca2+, oregon green  <dig> bapta- <dig>  to  <dig> mm kcl in pc <dig> cells. initial fluorescence brightness of the genetically encoded sensors and oregon green were approximately at the same level, and amplitudes of responses to ca2+ were very similar. this indicated that case <dig> and case <dig> are comparable with chemical probes for ca2+ in respect of signal brightness and dynamic range.

to further evaluate the sensors in comparison with chemical probes, we applied case <dig> for measuring the ca2+ response to a prolonged glutamate treatment  in cortical neurons. figure  <dig> illustrates typical response of cortical neuron transfected with case <dig> and loaded with fura-2ff, which is a widely used chemical ca2+ indicator. clear spectral differences allowed monitoring of fluorescence of both case <dig> and fura-2ff sensors independently, in sequential excitation mode. while fura-2ff response was tracked by  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm excited green fluorescence brightness , case <dig> fluorescence was monitored using 515– <dig> nm emission filter, with excitation at  <dig> nm. signals were measured within the same cells in parallel . stimulation of glutamate receptors induced primary increase in the cytosolic ca2+ concentration  that after a certain delay was superseded by the secondary c elevation referred to as loss of ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> . the signal of case <dig> clearly detected both phases of glutamate-induced c elevation . it is fair to note that the latent period between these phases was seen as a pronounced decrease in the case <dig> fluorescence, while the fura-2ff ratio showed increased c level during this period. taking into account that cpfp-based sensors are sensitive to ph changes, we presume that this decrease in case <dig> signal is caused by glutamate-induced decrease in cytosolic ph  <cit> . glutamate washout by ca2+-free egta -containing solution induced delayed c recovery. consequent application of protonophore fccp  in ca2+-free medium caused mitochondrial depolarization and released ca2+ accumulated by mitochondria during glutamate treatment  <cit> . both processes were clearly monitored by the case <dig> signal . in spite of the dramatic ph changes during glutamate treatment of cortical neurons, case <dig> clearly monitored all the changes in .

CONCLUSIONS
deeper understanding of cpfp-based sensors mechanics would contribute significantly to the development of "ideal" cpfp-based sensors, characterized with high brightness, dynamic range, ph- and photo-stability. we believe that proposed spatial arrangement of cpfp-based sensors  is close to the reality and that this model will be helpful for the further development of cpfp-based sensors for various analytes and cellular signaling events. however, solution of the crystal structure for one of the cpfp-based sensors remains an actual task in this respect.

developed high dynamic range sensors case <dig> and case <dig> set a new record among cpfp-based and, in general, among any gfp-based sensors reported up to date  <cit> . the most contrasting of the gfp-based fret-indicators, ca2+ sensor yc <dig>   <cit> , reaches a  <dig> -fold ratiometric fluorescence changes. the most contrasting of the reported cpfp-based sensors, flash-pericam, reaches a 8-fold increase of fluorescence  <cit> , whilst yielding to case <dig> and case <dig> in respect of ph-stability and signal brightness . the combined advantages should provide reliable monitoring of ca2+ signaling and suggest that case <dig> and case <dig> will become very popular research tools both in scientific studies and hts assays and might be able to replace some of the currently used chemical ca2+ probes.
