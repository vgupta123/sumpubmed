BACKGROUND
the core binding factor  is a transcriptional regulator complex, which is composed of two sub-units  <cit> . mammals have three genes coding for the α-subunits, runx <dig>  runx <dig> and runx <dig>  <cit> , and one coding for the β-subunit, cbfβ . the α-subunits recognize a specific sequence  in the regulatory regions of their target genes in order to bind dna directly, while the β-subunit heterodimerizes with the α-subunits but does not interact directly with the dna. the interaction with cbfβ stabilizes the runx-dna complex  <cit>  and protects the runx proteins from degradation  <cit> .

in humans, the cbf complex containing runx <dig> as the α-subunit is one of the most frequent targets of chromosomal and genetic alterations in leukemia. chromosomal rearrangements involving runx <dig> or cbfβ  <cit> , somatic point mutations in runx <dig>  <cit>  and amplification of runx <dig>  <cit>  have all been described in acute leukemia. in addition to somatic alterations, germ-line point mutations in runx <dig> are responsible for an autosomal dominant platelet disorder with a propensity to develop leukemia   <cit> . interestingly, the dosage of runx <dig> protein seems to play a role in the determination of the leukemic phenotype. indeed, low dosage of runx <dig>  resulting from haploinsufficient or dominant negative mutations, lead to the development of myeloid leukemia  <cit> , whereas amplification of runx <dig> gene is more often observed in lymphoid leukemia, particularly pediatric all  <cit> . a number of observations also suggest that although runx <dig> is involved in the first steps of leukemia development, additional somatic mutations are necessary and probably determinant for the leukemic phenotype: 1) the predisposition to develop leukemia in fpd-aml patients shows that germline runx <dig> mutations are not sufficient for the development of the disease  <cit> . 2) somatic translocations are not able to induce leukemia in mouse cells on their own  <cit> . 3) the translocation t, which fuses etv <dig>  to runx <dig>  can arise in utero but does not trigger leukemia until later in childhood, with as much as nine years latency  <cit> . these additional mutations are likely to occur in molecules involved in the same biological pathways as runx <dig>  as hemizygous loss of several molecules in the same biological pathway  is thought to be almost as tumorigenic as homozygous loss of one molecule   <cit> . therefore the identification of downstream targets of runx <dig>  with care to the model systems including species and cell type of origin, is of great interest in order to identify novel candidate molecules involved in leukemogenesis.

the identification of the biological pathways regulated by runx <dig> is also of importance to shed light on its in vivo function and role in leukemia development. the observation that runx <dig> knockout mice show a lack of definitive hematopoietic maturation and die at embryonic stage  <dig> from hemorrhages in the central nervous system demonstrates that runx <dig> plays a critical role during development of the hematopoietic system  <cit> . in addition, runx <dig> might also play a role in other systems as it is expressed in many other embryonic tissues  <cit>  and in epithelial cells  <cit> . it is furthermore overexpressed in endometrioid carcinoma  <cit>  and down-regulated in gastric cancer  <cit> . the in vivo function of runx <dig> is therefore yet to be fully understood.

here we describe the combination of a number of genomic and bioinformatic approaches to identify biological pathways downstream of runx <dig>  and report on a number of processes in which runx <dig> is likely to be involved. we also took advantage of the integration of these approaches in order to identify novel runx <dig> target genes.

RESULTS
gene expression profiling of cells harboring different levels of runx1
three different model systems were used to identify the biological pathways regulated by the runx <dig> transcription factor. these were haploinsufficiency using fpd-aml patient b cell lines , overexpression of cbf complex  in hela cells and runx <dig> deficiency in mouse embryos  .

lymphoblastic cells derived from fpd patients heterozygous for a runx <dig> frameshift mutation  were first analyzed. this mutation results in haploinsufficiency of runx <dig>  as the mutant protein has lost its capacity to bind dna and to transactivate the expression of the target genes  <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr on these non-leukemic lymphoblastic cells showed that affected individuals express approximately 55% of the transcript level observed in unaffected individuals . the genes differentially expressed between two affected and two non-affected cell lines are therefore largely the result of a low dosage of runx <dig> protein. using human cdna microarrays with the hs8k cdna clone library from research genetics and a selection of control spots,  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed, of which 52%  were down-regulated in affected individuals .

for overexpression studies, hela epithelial cells were transduced using adenoviral vectors. facs analysis showed that over 90% of hela cells were transduced by a egfp-expressing adenovirus . this system results in a highly homogenous cell population in which small changes of expression can be identified. the wild type cbf complex α-subunit, runx <dig>  was overexpressed together with the β-subunit, cbfβ  and seven hybridizations were performed. following overexpression of the cbf complex,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed including the up-regulation of 42% of the genes .

finally, we compared the expression profiles of two wild type and two runx <dig> knockout mouse embryo propers at each embryonic stages e <dig>  and e <dig> using affymetrix chips. despite the heterogeneity of the samples,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at embryonic stages e <dig>  and e <dig>  respectively. of these genes, 57%  and 72%  were down-regulated in the knockout embryos . these differences in expression are likely to reflect the lack of hematopoiesis and the premature death, respectively, observed in the runx <dig> embryos.

we then compared the different datasets using a mean-rank gene set enrichment test  in order to determine the level of connection between the  <dig> approaches , disregarding the cell type and the organism. high correspondence was observed between the two human datasets. the correspondence between the human and the mouse datasets was not as good, although still significant. this might partially be explained by the difficulties of matching human and mouse platforms .

correlation with clinical aml samples
it was first necessary to determine whether the genes identified in nonmyeloid cells in this study may play a role in myeloid leukemia development. we therefore compared our data to previously published microarray data obtained from  <dig> aml and  <dig> healthy samples  <cit> , using the mr-gse test. the high correspondence between the fpd-aml and cbf datasets had already suggested that a large number of downstream genes were similar between epithelial and lymphocytic cells. therefore we used each approach as representative of the runx <dig> gene dosage, regardless of the cell type. the aml samples used in the comparison include  <dig> patients with a t translocation, which fuses runx <dig> to eto, and  <dig> patients with inv, which fuses the co-factor cbfβ to myh <dig>  the other samples include a range of common alterations or no identified mutations. runx <dig> activation targets should be positively correlated with runx <dig> expression whereas repression targets should be negatively correlated. therefore we ranked all the probes-sets on the microarrays according to their correlation with runx <dig> across the  <dig> aml and normal samples . mr-gse tests demonstrated that genes up-regulated in the fpd-aml patients , had an expression trend opposite to runx <dig> in the aml patients, suggesting indeed that these genes are repressed in vivo in the presence of runx <dig> . on the other hand, the down-regulated genes do not show any statistically significant trend . similarly, the genes activated by the exogenous cbf complex had an expression pattern similar to runx <dig> across the clinical samples , whereas genes repressed by the cbf complex had an expression pattern opposite to runx <dig> .

mr-gse tests also showed that genes differentially expressed in the b cell lines derived from fpd-aml patients tended to be differentially expressed in the blasts and mononuclear cells of  <dig> clinical patients with a t translocation  and of  <dig> patients with the inv abnormality . for example, the top  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the fpd-aml dataset that are also differentially expressed in the clinical samples are shown in additional file  <dig> . as a whole, these results demonstrate that the genes identified in our study are likely to play an important role in the development of the disease.

biological processes regulated by runx1: bioinformatic approaches
bioinformatics tools taking into account all differentially expressed genes  were used to systematically identify the biological processes in which runx <dig> may be involved. a number of gene ontology  annotations were significantly enriched in each dataset . some were identified in more than one dataset such as "cadmium ion binding" and "immune response". other significantly represented processes were identified through the use of ingenuity pathways analysis  . these include cancer related genes as well as genes involved in hematological disorders. to complete this analysis, a mr-gse was also performed using a number of published gene sets related to thrombocytopenia, leukemia and cancer . significant correlation was obtained between the microarray datasets and a number of these sets of genes, including genes involved in megakaryopoiesis and cytokinesis, genes differentially expressed following irradiation of lymphoblasts, and genes consistently differentially expressed in solid-tissue tumors.

the most significant gene ontology annotations are indicated for each dataset as identified through gostat in april  <dig>  interpro motifs were identified through the fatigo program. the p-values are corrected for multiple testing .

biological processes regulated by runx1: in vivo confirmations
we designed a series of assays that were performed on either cell lines, or directly on samples from fpd-aml patients with runx <dig> mutations, to confirm the disturbance of several interesting biological processes identified by the above approaches.

heterozygous runx <dig> point mutations affect proliferation
runx <dig> is thought to be involved in the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, whose disruption leads to leukemia development. however, the molecular mechanisms behind this regulation are not known. we observed that genes participating in cellular proliferation were significantly enriched in both fpd and cbf datasets . the genes responsible for this enrichment are indicated in additional file  <dig> . we therefore performed a brdu proliferation assay in order to determine whether a subtle proliferation defect was present when runx <dig> level was lower in fpd-aml patients. a slower proliferation was indeed observed in fpd-aml lymphoblasts derived from two independent families compared to unaffected cells .

runx <dig> modulates microtubule stability
a significant enrichment of molecules containing a common tubulin motif was observed following overexpression of the cbf complex . five tubulin isoforms were down-regulated following overexpression of the cbf complex. these data led to the observation that cbf overexpression affected the expression of  <dig> genes associated with cytoskeletal structures according to go annotation . this class of genes was not significantly represented in the dataset from the fpd-aml cell lines, however this may be the result of the not complete knock-down of runx <dig> in the affected individuals leading to small changes that are not detected by microarray analysis. therefore we also tested whether microtubule stability was affected in these cell lines. significantly higher microtubule polymer levels were observed in the affected patients compared to the unaffected individuals . furthermore, the microtubules in affected cells could not be stabilized using the drug taxol to the same extent as the unaffected cells . this might result from the inability of the drug to bind to the microtubule molecule because of the unusual presence of other microtubule stabilizing proteins or from a lack of soluble tubulin molecules in the cellular environment. in any case, these results suggest that runx <dig> is involved in microtubule dynamics.

neither the proliferation nor the tubulin defects are due to the ebv transformation of the cell lines as many independent proliferation and tubulin polymerization assays performed on lymphoblastic cell lines derived from families with predispositions to various haematological malignancies do not show similar familial clustering .

genomic instability
highly significant correspondence was observed between the fpd, cbf and mouse datasets and the genes switched on after irradiation of lymphoblasts . we used a glycophorin a assay to test whether the fpd-aml patients are more prone to somatic genetic mutations than unaffected individuals. this test assesses the frequency of mutation events occurring at the glycophorin a locus in erythroid progenitors in blood of heterozygous individuals   <cit> . although more samples would be necessary for corroboration, a significant trend was present between the blood of two affected patients and five unaffected individuals, suggesting that a subtle increase of mutation rate may occur when runx <dig> activity is impaired . this increased mutation rate appears to be higher in the assay that would detect deletions , that are the predominate mutations arising due to ionizing irradiation  <cit> .

identification of potential novel runx <dig> target genes – co-expression in human tissues and hematopoietic cell lines
we reasoned that direct runx <dig> target genes must be expressed in the same tissues or cells as runx <dig>  thus, the expression patterns of a number of differentially expressed genes, chosen due to potential functions in leukemia development, were compared to that of runx <dig> . the expression of  <dig> genes in  <dig> human tissues,  <dig> hematopoietic cell lines and normal human bone cells was assessed using cdna panels  <cit> .  <dig> of these genes show a high expression in a number of hematopoietic cell lines and all the others show common expression with runx <dig> in various tissues such as liver and peripheral blood leukocytes .

identification of potential novel runx <dig> target genes – data overlaps
in order to distinguish between the direct runx <dig> target genes and those effected further downstream by a disregulation of runx <dig> level, we hypothesized that the genes in common in more than one dataset were more likely to be at the top of the genetic pathways regulated by runx <dig> and to be enriched for direct target genes. as suggested by the significant mr-gse results, we observed statistically significant overlap between each dataset. among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in fpd-aml cell lines,  <dig> genes were also differentially expressed following overexpression of the cbf complex, while only  <dig> were expected by chance . as anticipated when comparing an under- and overexpression system, 61%  of the genes in this overlap were differentially expressed in the opposite direction. among these  <dig> genes  <dig> were also differentially expressed in at least one embryonic stage of the runx <dig> knockout embryos .

runx <dig> bs: presence of a runx <dig> binding site in the regulatory region of the gene as determined by opossum. y stands for the presence of binding site and nd stands for not determined due to the absence of the gene in opossum.

identification of potential novel runx <dig> target genes – regulatory region analysis
in order to accumulate evidence that some of the genes present in these overlaps are direct target genes, we searched for human runx <dig> binding sites, which were conserved in mouse using the opossum software   <cit> . many differentially expressed genes contained at least one conserved runx <dig> binding site in their regulatory regions and the overlaps between the datasets show a higher enrichment for such genes as hypothesized above .

the regions flanking five putative conserved binding sites identified in three differentially expressed genes, and one negative control region, were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene and co-transfected together with plasmids expressing runx <dig> and cbfβ. these genes were selected because of their presence in the overlap between the human datasets and/or their interesting functions; anxa <dig>  is involved in cell proliferation and cytoskeleton regulation; armet  is mutated in cancer; cyr <dig>  promotes proliferation and angiogenesis. an increase in luciferase activity was observed for anxa <dig> binding sites and for one of the armet binding sites and a diminution of the luciferase activity was observed for the cyr <dig> binding site . no modification of the luciferase activity was observed for a sequence derived from the negative control casp <dig> regulatory region . it is likely that a combination of a number of binding sites and the presence of additional co-factors are necessary for a correct and synergistic in vivo regulation of these genes and it might explain the small activity observed for the armet binding sites. it might also explain the activation of the anxa <dig> site while this gene was repressed by the overexpression of the cbf complex.

discussion
runx <dig> is one of the most frequent targets of somatic mutations in leukemia and is mutated in an autosomal dominant disorder affecting platelets and predisposing to leukemia development. better characterization of its in vivo function is likely to give insight into the mechanisms leading to the development of leukemia, and will provide new candidate genes for leukemogenesis. we do not believe that as a transcription factor and master regulator of hematological cancers, runx <dig> will alter the function of only one oncogenic molecule, but multiple molecules in the same pathways, and our analyses and functional assays are carefully designed to study these effects. we have described a combination of genomic and bioinformatic approaches to identify the biological pathways and genes regulated by runx <dig>  an overview of which is in figure  <dig>  each approach independently provides a large source of data to identify runx <dig> targets according to runx <dig> gene dosage. however, the combination of them is powerful because of their convergence. although the approaches described here are not the ideal models to study myeloid leukemia, each of them has their own advantages and their integration compensates for their limitations: 1) the use of cells derived from patients harbouring a runx <dig> mutation but who have not yet developed leukemia allow us to observe effects, largely due to changes in runx <dig> dosage. however, it should be kept in mind that due to the difficulties of obtaining myeloid cell lines, these studies were performed in lymphoid cells. 2) the overexpression system using hela cells provided a highly homogenous cell population, which is necessary to perform gene expression profiling. 3) the knockout mouse embryos represent various cell types, however they give us global information of the complete absence of runx <dig>  which is difficult to obtain using cell lines. efficient and homogenous knockdown levels are indeed difficult to obtain using sirna especially in hematopoietic cells  <cit> .

the highly significant correlation observed between the genes identified in the fpd-aml cells and the overexpression system and clinical data on aml samples supports the hypothesis that large number of genes would be broadly regulated by runx <dig> in our various approaches disregarding of the cell type. genes identified as differentially expressed following disregulation of runx <dig> expression level and/or in these aml samples are good candidates for targets of secondary hits during leukemogenesis downstream of runx <dig> mutation. the various approaches described in this study, including conserved binding sites and co-expression studies, will also help to further prioritize genes that might sustain secondary hits. for example, the gene encoding the cyclin d <dig>  was differentially expressed following overexpression of the cbf complex and mutations in this gene have been described in acute myeloid leukemia patients  <cit> .

in order to generate insights into the in vivo role of runx <dig>  we employed bioinformatics tools to identify processes that were changed following alteration of runx <dig> expression level. we have shown that genes involved in megakaryopoiesis tend to be differentially expressed in the fpd and cbf datasets, demonstrating that a large number of the differentially expressed genes may play a role in platelet formation. enrichment for genes involved in cell proliferation was also observed in both the fpd and cbf datasets, and functional assays on the fpd-aml cell lines showed that heterozygous mutation of runx <dig> reduced proliferation of lymphoblasts. these data validate our integrative approach as they confirm studies in transgenic mice expressing the fusion proteins cbfβ-myh <dig>  <cit>  and runx1-eto  <cit> , which both act in a dominant negative fashion over the wild-type protein. these mice show a decrease in both lymphoid and myeloid cell proliferation. this observation also correlates with mouse data showing that runx <dig> promotes cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase  <cit> . an anti-proliferative effect of a runx <dig> mutant protein may have an oncogenic effect due to an improper balance between proliferation and differentiation. for example, overexpression of runx <dig> usually results in all while complete or partial loss of runx <dig> results in aml development.

our integrative approach unraveled a novel process that may play an important role in runx <dig> function, involving the cytoskeletal dynamics. indeed following the finding that an enrichment of microtubule and cytoskeleton related molecules was observed when the cbf complex was overexpressed, functional assay using the fpd-aml cells demonstrated an increase of polymerized microtubules in fpd-aml affected cells compared to cells from unaffected individuals. microtubules are important in many processes such as cell migration, cell division, cellular transport and signal transduction  <cit>  and microtubule remodeling is essential during the cell cycle, especially during mitosis when a correct microtubule network is essential for proper chromosomal segregation  <cit> . interestingly, the fusion protein, cbfβ-myh <dig> that results from inv, co-localizes with the actin cytoskeleton and disorganizes stress fibers and f-actin structures  <cit> . a mild microtubule defect might partially explain the platelet defect observed in fpd-aml patients, as microtubules are necessary at several different stages of megakaryopoiesis including endomitosis, production of platelets from mature polyploid megakaryocytes, and release of the content of platelet granules  <cit> . moreover, mutations in the actin-binding protein wasp and the myosin heavy chain myh <dig> cause the wiskott-aldrich  <cit>  and may-hegglin  <cit>  syndromes of thrombocytopenia, respectively. however, runx <dig> is likely to regulate only specific tubulin isoforms or tissue-specific cytoskeleton-associated proteins as a strong cytoskeleton defect would be more detrimental to the whole organism. in addition, the dosage of normal runx <dig> activity necessary for normal function might differ according to cell type, and some cell types may be more susceptible than others to perturbation in runx <dig> levels. interestingly, taxol resistant leukemic cells have been shown to have a reduced total level of tubulin and an increased level of polymerized tubulin  <cit> , similar to the results seen in the fpd-aml cells. furthermore, a high level of survivin , which was down-regulated following overexpression of the cbf complex, is associated with resistance to taxol  <cit> . this is the first evidence demonstrating a relationship between runx <dig> and microtubule dynamics.

finally, we showed that the predisposition of fpd-aml to develop leukemia may be due to an increased rate of mutation in runx <dig> heterozygous cells. every dataset showed significant correspondence with genes involved in dna damage response. although not conclusive, the glycophorin a assay, which measures the frequency of the progeny of mutated erythrocyte precursors in blood, showed a mild increase in mutation frequency in fpd-aml patients compared to unaffected individuals. recently, it was shown that the runx1-eto fusion protein induces mutations in transfected u <dig> myeloid cells  <cit> . this study demonstrated that the fusion protein regulates many genes involved in the base excision repair pathway, which mainly corrects for point mutations. furthermore, a higher incidence of leukemia in cbfβ-myh <dig> chimeras compared to normal chimeras when exposed to enu mutagenesis has also been observed  <cit> . this demonstrates that alteration of runx <dig> function may increase the rate of mutation and lead to an accumulation of mutated cells.

the three processes described here  are tightly interconnected and may explain the phenotype observed in fdp-aml patients. indeed, a proliferation defect would have an impact on megakaryopoiesis and cytoskeleton remodeling. in turn, a cytoskeleton defect could also affect proliferation and trigger chromosomal aberrations. the necessary threshold level of runx <dig> expression is likely to be cell-specific, explaining why runx <dig> heterozygous mutation affects only hematopoietic cells; nevertheless, our observations could conceivably suggest possible involvement of runx <dig> in solid-tissue tumor.

we also identified new potential runx <dig> target genes by analyzing the regulatory regions and the expression pattern of the differentially expressed genes present in the overlaps between the different platforms. many runx <dig> target genes have already been described in the literature, mainly from in vitro studies and in mouse cells  <cit> . four of the published target genes, csf1r, myb, mpo and timp <dig>  were differentially expressed in the runx <dig> knockout embryos. in addition, target genes that were described more recently, including ccnd <dig>  <cit>  and igfbp <dig>  <cit> , were identified following overexpression of the cbf complex. that there was not more correlation may be due to incomplete microarray platforms, but more importantly is likely to reflect the bias present in the published runx <dig> target genes that were identified because of their primary role in hematopoiesis and these may not represent the most common runx <dig> target genes. interesing candidates were among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in every dataset, such as annexin i , which was shown to reduce inflammation, by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment  <cit>  and has an anti-proliferative effect by inducing aberrant cytoskeleton formation  <cit> . this gene is likely to play an important role downstream of runx <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this combination of gene expression profiling platforms allowed prioritization of novel candidate genes for leukemogenesis according to distinct parameters and has shed light on runx <dig> functions by identifying biological pathways downstream of runx <dig> such as microtubule stability and genomic instability and identified a large number of potential novel runx <dig> target genes. whether or not these are direct runx <dig> targets remains to be demonstrated by further research.
