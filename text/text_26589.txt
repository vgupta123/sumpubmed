BACKGROUND
the genus propionibacterium belongs to the phylum actinobacteria and contains classical  and cutaneous species. whereas classical species such as propionibacterium freudenreichii are considered to have probiotic effects  <cit>  and are rather well characterized due to their importance in the dairy industry, cutaneous species are less well understood. the three most important cutaneous species are p. acnes, p. avidum and p. granulosum; these species can be found on the skin of virtually every human being, and they are also found on other tissue sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and the prostate  <cit> . as part of the skin microbiota, both p. acnes and p. granulosum are found in sebaceous-rich areas, but p. acnes predominates in areas such as scalp, forehead, ear, back, and alae nasi  <cit> . p. avidum prefers moist rather than oily areas; it is found mainly in the anterior nares, axilla, and rectum  <cit> .

the role of human-associated bacterial species belonging to the genus propionibacterium is largely unknown; these species are described as commensals, saprophytes, parasites or opportunistic pathogens. the pathogenic side of cutaneous propionibacteria, in particular p. acnes is slowly gaining attention. apart from its possible role in acne vulgaris due to its immunostimulatory property, p. acnes has been associated with a number of other diseases  <cit> . recently, p. acnes were found in diseased prostatic tissue  <cit> , and its contribution to prostate pathologies is currently under investigation. in our previous study, we isolated p. acnes, p. avidum and p. granulosum from radical prostatectomy specimens  <cit> . little is known about the association of p. avidum and p. granulosum with human diseases. p. avidum has been found to cause abscess formation, in particular after surgical intervention; it has been described as the cause of abdominal wall and intra-peritoneal, perianal, psoas, splenic, and breast abscesses  <cit> . the disease association of p. granulosum is less clear, though it has been found in a few cases of endocarditis and endophthalmitis, and has been associated, like p. acnes, with sarcoidosis  <cit> .

it is not understood if all cutaneous propionibacteria have similar disease-causing potentials. the genome sequence of p. acnes and subsequent studies have highlighted host-interacting factors such as camp factors, hemolysins, sialidases and dermatan-sulphate adhesins  <cit> . to date it is not clear if these factors are shared in all cutaneous propionibacteria. here, we provide genomic insight into p. avidum and p. granulosum, and compare these genomes to p. acnes. we also performed electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy analysis on these species to further highlight differences among cutaneous propionibacteria. together with proteomic data, our study highlights the individuality of each of the three human-associated propionibacterial species. in particular, the distinct surface structures suggest that each species interacts differently with the human host, which likely results in distinct pathogenic potentials.

RESULTS
comparative genome analysis of cutaneous propionibacteria
seven genomes were analyzed and compared, two of each species, p. acnes  and p. granulosum , and three genomes of p. avidum . four genomes were available from public databases    <cit> , p. acnes  <dig>   <cit> , p. avidum  <dig>   <cit>  and p. avidum atcc <dig> ) and we draft sequenced three additional ones  and p. avidum tm <dig>  p. granulosum tm <dig> and p. avidum tm <dig> were both isolated from radical prostatectomy specimens  <cit> , and p. avidum  <dig> was isolated from a human skin abscess  <cit> . p. avidum atcc <dig> and p. granulosum dsm <dig> are both type strains.

first analysis revealed the much smaller genomes of the two p. granulosum strains, which is in average 400 kb smaller than p. acnes and p. avidum . a bidirectional blast revealed the core genome and species-specific genes of cutaneous propionibacteria .  <dig> proteins are common to all three species . kegg analysis showed that this core genome encodes main metabolic pathways, including the propionate formation pathway, the respiratory chain and the fatty acid metabolism . p. acnes proteins encoded by the core genome show in average 89% and 73% identity to homologs of p. avidum and p. granulosum, respectively. this is in agreement with phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequences, showing that p. acnes and p. avidum are closely related, whereas p. granulosum is more distant .

larger and smaller species-specific genomic islands were identified . most of these are associated with a significant divergence from the main g + c content, which could indicate horizontal gene transfer  events. for example, the two genomes of p. acnes contain larger regions  not present in p. avidum and p. granulosum; these encode among others non-ribosomal peptide synthetases , and harbor genes for nitrate reductase and anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase  . other interesting results of comparative genome analyses are reported in the next sections.

absence of host-interacting, putative virulence factors in the genomes of p. avidum and p. granulosum
genome sequencing of p. acnes revealed the existence of five christie-atkins-munch-petersen  factors  <cit> . at least three of these, camp factors  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are produced as either secreted or surface-exposed proteins  <cit> . it has been shown that at least camp factor  <dig> has properties of a co-hemolysin and exotoxin  <cit> . genome analysis revealed now that the genes camp <dig>  camp <dig> and camp <dig> are absent from the genomes of p. avidum and p. granulosum. the latter genome carries only one camp factor gene, designated here camp factor  <dig> , since it has no strong similarity to one of the five camp factors of p. acnes. p. avidum contains two camp factor genes with high similarities to camp factors  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . interestingly, when comparing the genomic regions containing the camp <dig>  camp <dig> and camp <dig> genes in p. acnes with the genome of p. avidum, we noticed that the camp factor genes are encoded on genomic island-like regions . for example, the camp <dig> gene is inserted as part of a six-gene cluster into the backbone genome. this cluster also contains two genes encoding sialidases  and a sialic acid transporter . the camp <dig> containing region is replaced in p. avidum with a region of eight genes encoding a putative arsenate reductase and transposases, underlining the mobile nature of this genomic region. the camp <dig> region is replaced in p. avidum with an island-like region of  <dig> genes, encoding among others a type i restriction-modification system.

besides the camp genes also other predicted host-interacting factor-encoding genes of p. acnes are absent from the genomes of p. avidum and p. granulosum, including a hyaluronate lyase , the two dermatan-sulphate adhesins dsa <dig> and dsa <dig>  <cit> , and other proline-threonine repeat-motif proteins  . furthermore, the characterized sialidase  that has been shown to have a role in p. acnes adhesion and cytotoxicity  <cit> , is truncated in p. avidum atcc <dig> and absent from p. avidum  <dig> and p. granulosum dsm <dig> and tm <dig>  we tested the sequenced strains for hyaluronidase and neuraminidase activities: only the p. acnes strains were positive , thus confirming findings from genome analyses.

p. avidum produces an exopolysaccharide-like structure
the search for species-specific genomic regions identified a large genomic island, present in all p. avidum genomes , that is absent from p. acnes and p. granulosum . this region harbors  <dig> genes ,  <dig> of them encode glycosyl transferases and enzymes involved in mono- or polysaccharide modification. we noticed a similarity of this cluster to a 20-gene cluster found in the genome of rothia mucilaginosa, a gram-positive, coagulase-negative coccus that is part of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract in humans . r. mucilaginosa produces a thick exopolysaccharide -like structure  <cit> ; thus, we applied electron microscopy to examine the cell morphology of p. avidum. we observed a meshwork structure surrounding cells of p. avidum that was absent from p. acnes and p. granulosum , and that is very similar to the meshwork structures surrounding r. mucilaginosa. atomic force microscopy further confirmed the presence of an extracellular structure of p. avidum extending several μm from the cell surface . the afm imaging excludes the possibility of artifacts caused by the vacuum environment of the electron microscope, but the structure did collapse on to the cell surface and underlying glass substrate upon gentle air drying of the sample. it is probably a highly hydrated and amorphous material when in aqueous solution, as it appears more amorphous rather than filamentous in structure at the cell surface where some level of hydration remains. to investigate the composition of this structure, we used specific fluorescent stains for dna and for carbohydrates , which revealed that the structure is made of polysaccharides containing β- <dig>  or β- <dig>  bonds.

p. granulosum possesses pili-like appendices
electron microscopy further revealed pili- or fimbriae-like appendices on the cell surface of p. granulosum . such structures were not detected on the surface of p. acnes and p. avidum. pili or fimbriae are found in several gram-positive bacteria, including some species of the related genus corynebacterium <cit> . in corynebacterium sp. pilin subunits are encoded in several gene clusters that also contain genes for pilin-specific sortases. in a search for such gene clusters in the genome of p. granulosum we found two gene clusters that encode multiple sortases  and homologs of several pilin subunits of corynebacterium sp., namely the major pilin spad and minor pillins spab, spac, spaf and spai . these two clusters are absent from the genomes of p. acnes and p. avidum. the spa-like proteins possess a typical lpxtg sorting motif for anchoring at the c-terminus, and a n-terminal signal peptide. in order to investigate which proteins are involved in pilus formation in p. granulosum we identified surface-attached proteins via a surfome approach . two pilin subunits were identified in strain dsm <dig>  namely homologs of spad  and spab  that are 33% and 35% identity to spad and spab of corynebacterium ulcerans and corynebacterium resistens, respectively . the spad homolog could represent the major subunit of the pilus, and the spab homolog could be a minor pilin, in analogy to the spad-type pilus of corynebacterium diphtheria <cit> .

listed are all surface-exposed proteins that possess a typical n-terminal signal peptide. see additional file  <dig> for a complete list.

secreted and surface-associated proteins of p. avidum, p. granulosum and p. acnes
we determined main secreted and surface-attached proteins of the three cutaneous propionibacteria, since such proteins could mediate the contact with human tissue sites, and could reveal host-interacting strategies. for determining secreted proteins, we collected culture supernatants, precipitated the secreted proteins and identified prominent bands on a 1d-sds-page gel by mass spectrometry . for p. avidum atcc <dig> the main secreted protein, under the applied growth conditions, is a triacylglycerol lipase that is 48% similar to geha , a characterized lipase of p. acnes. furthermore, a homolog of camp factor  <dig> and several proteins of unknown function could be detected in the supernatant of p. avidum atcc <dig> . all identified eight secreted proteins of p. avidum have a homolog in p. acnes; five of eight homologs have also been detected in p. acnes supernatants  <cit> . p. granulosum dsm <dig> abundantly secretes two proteins, with peaks in the beginning of the stationary phase: two predicted lysophospholipases that are 53% and 56% similar to a putative lysophospholipase  of p. acnes . homologs of all secreted proteins in p. granulosum have been detected in culture supernatants of p. acnes <cit> . homologs of one protein  are secreted by all cutaneous propionibacteria; the function of ppa <dig> is unknown. our previous study has shown that p. acnes, regardless of the specific subtype, abundantly secretes camp factor  <dig>  a putative lysozyme , an endoglycoceramindase , and a protein of unknown function   <cit> . homologs of none of these proteins were detected in culture supernatants of p. avidum atcc <dig> or p. granulosum dsm20700; the corresponding genes are absent from their genomes . this indicates that p. acnes secretes a unique set of factors.

the surface-exposed proteins were determined by a surfome-approach that is based on trypsin cleavage of surface-exposed protein moieties  <cit> . in all three propionibacterium species the most abundantly detected surface-attached proteins were rlpa-domain containing lipoproteins . two such proteins  were detected on the surface of p. acnes. ppa <dig> is exclusively produced by p. acnes; it contains a bacterial sh <dig> and a peptidoglycan-binding domain . the corresponding gene is absent from the genomes of p. avidum and p. granulosum. homologs of the other lipoprotein, ppa <dig>  were also abundantly detected on p. granulosum dsm <dig>  and p. avidum atcc <dig> . additional species-specific surface-attached factors were identified, e.g. camp factor  <dig> of p. granulosum. in p. acnes, camp factors  <dig> and  <dig> were detected as well as two endoglycoceramidases and two groel chaperonins . the duplication of surface-exposed factors points to some redundancy, and could indicate that the duplicated factors are of high importance for p. acnes.

discussion
here, we analyzed and compared the genomes of the three propionibacterial species known to colonize the human skin. species-specific gene clusters were identified in each genome that encode traits for colonization and host-interaction. applying high-resolution microscopy and proteomic approaches we could verify the production of these surface-associated functions.

p. avidum was found to be surrounded by an eps-like meshwork. a gene cluster that encodes proteins involved in the biosynthesis and modification of eps was identified. the cluster encodes several homologs for enzymes involved in lps and eps biosynthesis  as well as a number of glycosyl transferases with unknown specificities. rfba, b, d are found in lactococcus lactis, and required for dtdp-rhamnose biosynthesis, which is an important precursor of rhamnose-containing exopolysaccharides  <cit> . the genes neua and neub are found in the lps biosynthesis gene clusters of several gram-negative species. neua and neub have been shown to be important in polysialic acid capsule biosynthesis  <cit> . the p. avidum eps gene cluster lacks a gene for a flippase, indicating that the eps structure is formed on the outside of the cell. interestingly, the cluster also contains genes involved in trehalose biosynthesis . the disaccharide trehalose can protect cells from environmental stresses such as low water availability  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> genes have a homolog in r. mucilaginosa that produces a mucilaginous capsular material  <cit> . like p. avidum, r. muciloginosa is occasionally isolated from disease sites, thus regarded as an opportunistic pathogen, for instance involved in prosthetic device infections. well-studied eps in other bacteria, such as in pseudomonas aeruginosa, have several roles in pathogenicity; eps contributes to biofilm formation, adherence to surfaces and host cells, evasion of phagocytosis, and elicitation of immune response  <cit> . we hypothesize that the eps structure of p. avidum could have a role in biofilm formation, and thereby contribute to its pathogenicity by leading to persistent infections that cannot be cleared by the immune system. this might explain why p. avidum is in particular recognized in abscess formation after surgical intervention  <cit> . it should be noted that several studies reported the presence of a cell wall-associated polysaccharide of p. acnes that can partially be extracted by phenol extraction  <cit> . such a cell wall polysaccharide was further described as a lipidated macroamphiphile; this lipoglycan cell envelope component of p. acnes was found to have a lipid anchor and a polysaccharide moiety containing mannose, glucose and galactose, and probably diaminohexuronic acid  <cit> . we strongly suspect that the lipoglycan of p. acnes is distinct from the eps of p. avidum. we tested different strains of p. acnes grown under different conditions and could not detect any eps-like structure by em analyses . to our knowledge no study so far could visualize an eps-like meshwork on p. acnes cells. moreover, the identified putative eps biosynthesis genes of p. avidum are absent from the genomes of p. acnes .

we found that p. granulosum possesses pili/fimbriae-like appendices and pilin subunits were identified among cell surface-exposed proteins of p. granulosum. we determined two gene clusters encoding pilin subunits in direct vicinity to genes encoding sortases. such clustering of genes for sortase and pilin subunits has been reported for a number of gram-positive bacteria, including related actinobacteria such as corynebacterium diphtheriae that produces three distinct pilus structures, spaa-, spad- and spah-type pili  <cit> . in corynebacteria pilins are covalently polymerized and the formed pilus is anchored to the bacterial cell wall; these steps are catalyzed by pilin-specific and housekeeping sortases, respectively. it has been shown that minor pilins  represent the major adhesins of corynebacteria  <cit> . thus, we hypothesize that pili of p. granulosum could have a role in adhesion to human skin tissue and colonization. they might also have a role in forming a multispecies biofilm, since p. granulosum and p. acnes are often detected together within sebaceous follicles. the anchorage of the base of the pilus to the cell wall is usually mediated by a housekeeping sortase  <cit> . a likely candidate for this housekeeping sortase was identified among the surface-associated proteins: h641_ <dig> , a protein with a sortase e domain. a homolog exists in p. acnes kpa  and in p. avidum atcc <dig> . these sortases likely catalyze the anchoring of other lpxtg-motif proteins of the three propionibacterial species to their cell walls. a genome search revealed that p. avidum contains  <dig>  p. acnes  <dig>  and p. granulosum  <dig> proteins  with a c-terminal lpxtg motif. most of these lpxtg-motif proteins have no or little similarity to known proteins, exceptions are proteins with nucleotidase or phosphoesterase domains. only few of these lpxtg-motif proteins have been identified in the surfome. that could either indicate that they were not or weakly expressed under the applied growth conditions , or were not accessible for trypsin cleavage.

analysis of the surfome data of p. granulosum further revealed the presence of several cytosolic proteins, including ribosomal proteins and those involved in core metabolic functions . that indicates that p. granulosum seems to be more sensitive to trypsin treatment or lyse earlier than p. avidum and p. acnes.

p. acnes has, unlike p. granulosum and p. avidum, no obvious surface appendices. however, p. acnes is by far the most prevalent bacterium in sebaceous follicles of the face and back  <cit> . thus, this species must have evolved a different strategy to adhere to and colonize human tissues. surface proteins could act as powerful adhesins. indeed, the dermatan-sulphate adhesins dsa <dig> and dsa <dig> have been identified and partially characterized in p. acnes <cit> . these were not found in the surfome of the strain kpa, most likely because the respective genes are phase variable, but dsa <dig> and dsa <dig> are present on the surface of the type ia strain  <dig> . in addition, the surfome data revealed an abundance of lipoproteins with rlpa  domains on the surface of p. acnes. the bacterium specifically produces ppa <dig> on the surface; it contains a sh <dig> and a peptidoglycan-binding domain . bacterial lipoproteins have diverse functions; they play roles in a wide range of physiological processes. they can also function as ligands of the innate immunity host cell receptor toll-like receptor  <dig> , thus triggering an innate immune reaction  <cit> . it has been reported that tlr <dig> was sufficient for nf-kappab activation in response to p. acnes and activation of tlr <dig> resulted in an inflammatory cytokine response, which is thought to be of crucial importance in acne vulgaris  <cit> . the tlr <dig> ligand of p. acnes is so far unknown. we speculate that one or all of the surface-exposed rlpa-domain lipoproteins of p. acnes are tlr <dig> ligands. these lipoproteins are abundantly produced on the surface of p. acnes and they are not covered or protected from host cell contact by other surface structures, such as eps or pili in p. avidum and p. granulosum, respectively. it will be interesting to investigate if p. avidum and p. granulosum are also able to trigger tlr <dig> responses, or if this is specific to p. acnes.

the colonization of human skin by p. acnes can be achieved by other strategies, such as factors that allow successful competition with other bacteria, including p. avidum and p. granulosum. successful competition might include the efficient acquisition of nutrients from host components. in this respect, only p. acnes expressed surface-attached endoglycoceramidases, which might hydrolyze gangliosides on host cell membranes  <cit> . another specific feature of p. acnes is the presence and the production of surface-exposed camp factors  <dig> and  <dig>  it has been shown that camp factor  <dig> has properties of a co-hemolysin  <cit> . moreover, inhibition of camp <dig> by neutralizing antibodies efficiently attenuated p. acnes-induced inflammation in the mouse ear model  <cit> , suggesting that camp <dig>  and probably the other ones as well, are virulence factors of p. acnes. the corresponding camp <dig> and camp <dig> genes are absent in the genomes of p. granulosum and p.avidum. camp factors have been partially characterized in streptococcal species as co-hemolsyins and pore-forming toxins  <cit> . they are involved in the camp reaction, the lysis of sheep erythrocytes by the synergistic action of the sphingomyelinase c from s. aureus and camp factor from group b streptococcus strains  <cit> . the sphingomyelinase initially hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide  on the erythrocyte membrane, which renders the erythrocytes susceptible to the lytic activity of camp factor. it was recently shown that camp factor  <dig> of p. acnes can act as an exotoxin, exhibiting cytotoxic activity on host cells  <cit> . the study of nakatsuji et al. further suggests that camp factor  <dig> acts together with host acid sphingomyelinase to amplify bacterial virulence, thus supporting the degradation and invasion of host cells. the gene for camp factor  <dig> is located within a small gene cluster that also contains genes encoding sialidases and a sialic acid transporter. this cluster seems to be inserted into the p. acnes genome . it is tempting to suggest a functional connection of these factors as host-interacting and/or virulence traits. one possible scenario is that sialidases act directly on host cell membrane exposed gangliosides, thus releasing terminal sialic acid residues that are taken up by the sialic acid transporter and used as energy source. the remaining ceramide moiety could be a binding site for camp factor  <dig>  in analogy to the camp reaction. another component in this scenario could be surface-associated endoglycoceramidases of p. acnes that is predicted to hydrolyze gangliosides on host cell membranes into ceramides and oligosaccharides.

important questions remain to be answered, in particular regarding the host tissue and host cell interactions of these three species. although all three species are colonizing human skin, it is not known if these species actually compete at those sites or have adapted to occupy unique niches through species-specific host interactions. the different surface properties of the three species suggest that they have different colonization strategies that could be host cell or tissue-specific at skin and non-skin sites.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, comparative genome analysis showed that camp factor  <dig> and  <dig> and other host-interacting traits  are encoded on smaller genomic regions that are either inserted into the genome of p. acnes or deleted from the genomes of p. avidum and p. granulosum. that might explain the greater versatility of p. acnes to interact with the human host. p. avidum and to a minor extent p. granulosum have their own species-specific genomic regions, that are absent from p. acnes. among these are the eps cluster of p. avidum and the pili/fimbriae gene clusters of p. granulosum. thus, human-associated propionibacteria have evolved different host-interacting strategies which are likely linked to different disease-causing potentials of these three species.
