BACKGROUND
siglec- <dig>  is a sialic acid binding inhibitory receptor expressed on nk and nkt cells and to a lesser extend also on monocytes  <cit> . it shows a prevalence for binding α- <dig> -linked or branched α- <dig> -linked sialic acids in vitro and is constitutively masked by a endogenous ligand in vivo  <cit>  which has not been identified yet. it has been shown that trans-activation of unmasked siglec- <dig> leads to an inhibition of nk cell cytotoxicity  <cit> . natural killer cells are characterized by the expression of cd <dig> . ncam is an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule  and was the first vertebrate protein demonstrated to be glycosylated with polysialic acid , which is a homomeric polymer of α- <dig> -sialic acid. until now only very few proteins have been reported to be modified with psa  <cit> .

our question was whether cd <dig> on nk cells is polysialylated and if psa-ncam could be the endogenous ligand masking siglec- <dig>  for this purpose we performed a facs analysis examining psa expression on peripheral blood. the impact of psa on nk cell cytotoxicity was determined by killing assays after specific enzymatic removal of sialic acids.

RESULTS
detection of psa expression in human peripheral blood
to detect psa+ cells in peripheral blood we used an antibody which binds psa of at least twelve α- <dig> -linked sialic acid residues  <cit> . co-staining of psa and cd <dig> not only shows co-expression but also a strong correlation of staining intensity, which indicates that cd <dig> on nk cells, is polysialylated . co-expression of psa and cd <dig> was also verified by immunocytochemical staining . polysialylation of ncam on nk cells has also been suggested by lanier et al. who sowed excessive sialylation of ncam, but the nature of the linking of sialic acid monomers was not investigated  <cit> .

to exclude psa expression by other hematopoietic cell lineages we compared expression of cd <dig> with anti psa staining. for this purpose co-stainings with several lineage markers for t cells , monocytes , b cells , nk cells , dendritic cells and basophiles  and stem cells  were performed. facs analysis showed psa staining on cd56+cells and on small subpopulations of cd3+ and cd8+ cells, which also express cd <dig> . our data indicates that psa-ncam is expressed by nk and nkt cells, cell types which are also known to express siglec- <dig>  <cit> .

characterization of polysialyltransferase expression in nk cells
two enzymes have been shown to be independently able to synthesize psa, the polysialyltransferases siat8d  and siat8b . to determine which polysialylating enzymes are involved in the expression of psa on nk cells reverse transcriptase pcr was performed. we compared siat8d and siat8b mrna expression in adult cd56+ nk cells and in human adult and fetal brain. expression of siat8d was found in nk cells as well as in both brain samples. in contrast siat8b was expressed predominantly in fetal brain, but the expression was drastically reduced in adult brain and could not be detected in adult nk cells . these findings suggest that only siat8d contributes to ncam polysialylation in peripheral blood nk cells. siat8d expression by nk cells was also reported recently by avril and colleagues  <cit> .

functionality of nk cells after separation via psa
in order to provide functional evidence, psa+ cells and via cd <dig> isolated nk cells were compared using k <dig> killing assays. as shown in fig. 4a, cells separated either via cd <dig> or psa show expression of psa. separated cells were co-cultured with the target cell line k <dig> for four hours followed by a killing efficiency determination. a comparative killing assay showed only a small difference in killing efficiency . comparison of killing efficiencies at the effector target ratio 50: <dig> showed no significant reduction of killing ability by the separation strategy . the slightly reduced killing efficiency of cells separated via psa could be caused by the large labeling complex  due to steric inhibition. these data indicate that cells separated via psa are functional nk cells.

impact of psa expression on nk cell function
to investigate the potential impact of polysialic acid on the killing ability of nk cells, sialic acid residues were removed enzymatically with clostridium perfringens neuraminidase or endo-nf and nk cells were again tested in a killing assay. clostridium perfringens neuraminidase is able to remove all sialic acid residues  from the cell surface while endo-nf removes only α- <dig> -linked sialic acid residues. after enzymatic treatment the vitality was not reduced significantly . as can be seen in fig 5a and 6a only few psa expressing cells are remaining after neuraminidase or endo-nf treatment. only 5% of neuraminidase treated cells and 2% of endo-nf treated cells show re-expression of psa on the cell surface after  <dig> h culture in rpmi/ <dig> mm l-glutamine/10% fcs  indicating that psa is only weakly re-expressed during the killing assay. the comparative killing assay revealed a strongly reduced killing efficiency of neuraminidase treated nk cells . comparison of killing efficiencies at the target effector ratio 1: <dig> showed a highly significant reduction of killing ability of nk cells after neuraminidase treatment  while endo-nf treatment had no impact on the killing efficiency .

discussion
the role of psa-ncam in the developing brain is well characterized, whereas only little is known about psa-ncam expression and function in other organs.

the results presented here show psa-ncam expression on functional human peripheral blood nk cells, which can be isolated via psa without loss of function.

phenotyping experiments with several lineage markers for t cells , monocytes , b cells , nk cells , dendritic cells and basophiles  and stem cells  demonstrated expression of psa on cd56+/cd45+ nk cells and on cd3+/cd8+/cd45+/cd56+ nkt cells.

functionality of psa+ cells was analyzed using killing assays, showing that nk cells separated according to their expression of psa showed only a slightly reduced killing capacity compared to nk cells separated using cd <dig> microbeads. the large labeling complex used to isolate psa+ cells could cause this reduction due to steric inhibition. psa expression has also been described on decidual nk cells   <cit>  which are located in the human placenta where they play an important role in maintaining pregnancy. in contrast to peripheral blood derived nk cells dnk cells show only week cytotoxicity. and as their expression pattern differs from peripheral blood nk cells, even a different nk cell lineage arising from a different progenitor was suggested  <cit> .

pcr analysis of the expression of the two polysialyltransferases siat8d and siat8b showed that nk cells only express siat8d. it has been shown that siat8d plays a predominant role in ncam polysialylation and that mrna levels strongly correlate with protein expression  <cit> . we could show that siat8d is strongly expressed on mrna level in nk cells, which suggests that siat8d is the main polysialylating enzyme in adult nk cells. its expression also provides additional evidence for polysialylation of ncam.

as has been described before, enzymatic removal of all sialic acid residues with clostridium perfringens neuraminidase reduced the killing efficiency of cd56+ cells dramatically due to de-masking of siglec- <dig>  <cit> . however endo-nf treatment of nk cells did not lead to a reduction of killing efficiency. a reduction of psa polymerization degree is supposed to have a major effect on psa function. we thus conclude that psa is not involved in masking siglec- <dig> 

removal of psa using endo-nf creates a rest of four α- <dig> -linked sialic acid residues  <cit> . the psa antibody  used in the experiments above recognizes psa of a minimum chain length of twelve sialic acid residues  <cit> . we thus conclude that after endo-nf treatment a minimum of four and a maximum of eleven α- <dig> -linked sialic acid residues are still left on the nk cell surface. the fact that removal of sialic acid residues with endo-nf does not lead to a reduced cytotoxicity of nk cells gives rise to the speculation that the unknown endogenous ligand of siglec- <dig> consists either of maximal four α- <dig> -linked sialic acid residues or α- <dig> -linked branched sialic acid residues. other candidates for the masking ligand of siglec- <dig> have already been identified. avril et al. for example showed recently expression of a so far uncharacterized α- <dig> -disialylated o-linked glycan by nk cells  <cit> .

the role of psa-ncam on nk cells remains unknown. psa-ncam has been characterized in the nervous system, where it has an impact on cell migration, axonal path finding, neurite outgrowth, fasciculation of neurites and also modulates ampa receptors  <cit>  . muscle cells, including cardiac myocytes also express psa-ncam during development. furthermore psa can directly modulate the homophilic binding potential of ncam  <cit>  and also interactions with other proteins. and agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix has been suggested to bind the heparin-binding site of ncam and psa  <cit> . signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor   <cit>  and platelet derived growth factor   <cit>  is affected by the psa moieties bound to ncam.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we could show expression of psa-ncam on functional human peripheral blood nk cells. our data strongly indicates that the polysialyltransferase siat8d is responsible for psa expression in nk cells. killing assays after specific removal of psa revealed that elimination of psa has no effect on nk cell cytotoxicity and thus indicate that polysialic acid is not the endogenous ligand masking siglec- <dig>
