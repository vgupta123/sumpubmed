BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are gram-negative prokaryotes that synthesize chlorophyll a and carry out photosynthetic water oxidation  <cit> . since they have simple nutritional requirements, needing only air, water and mineral salts, with light as the only energy source  <cit> , their potential industrial application is significant – from e.g. hydrogen production  <cit>  to various biotechnological purposes  <cit> .

in order to develop this biotechnological potential, it is important to thoroughly understand different aspects of cyanobacterial physiology and metabolism. as a part of such a process, obtaining reliable gene expression data is vital. several methods, from northern blotting to microarrays, are routinely used to obtain such data. the validity and reproducibility of the data obtained depend on the quality of the extracted rna and the degree of genomic dna contamination. however, cyanobacteria present particular challenges when it comes to nucleic acid isolation – these organisms possess an extended array of secondary metabolites  <cit>  that impair e.g. cell lysis and nucleic acid purification  <cit> .

in order to assess the quality of rna preparations two strategies are commonly followed: spectrophotometric analysis and ribosomal integrity verification by electrophoresis.

from the spectrophotometric analysis three absorbance values usually are taken into consideration –  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm. the ratio between the absorbance at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm is used to evaluate the purity of the nucleic acid – for "pure" rna a ratio around  <dig>  is expected. a lower ratio may indicate the presence of proteins and peptides absorbing around  <dig> nm. additionally, the ratio between the absorbance at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm is expected to be  <dig>  for "pure" nucleic acid samples. a lower ratio might be the consequence of contamination by peptides, phenols, aromatic compounds or carbohydrates.

the integrity of the ribosomal rna sub-units , the presence/absence of low weight rna degradation products and the presence/absence of genomic dna contamination are commonly visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis. ideally, all expected ribosomal rna sub-units should be observed, with no signs of rna degradation products or presence of genomic dna.

the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction  <cit> , commercially available as trizol  or tri reagent , is a frequently used method for cyanobacterial rna extraction. this method, from this point referred to as trizol, is usually associated with bead beating for physical disruption of the cells. in the present work we introduce the pgtx reagent, a reduced cost alternative to trizol, and evaluate its use while exploring different extraction protocol variants.

RESULTS
extraction buffer  formulation
the most important factor when planning the composition of the extraction buffer pgtx  was to give the extraction solution the ability to quickly inhibit ribonuclease activity. both phenol and guanidine salts are very efficient protein denaturants, therefore ideal for fast ribonuclease denaturation, and their combined use has been previously described  <cit> . we also added 8-hydroxyquinoline since it acts both as phenol stabilizer  and as rnase inhibitor  <cit> .

the poor miscibility of phenol with water allows for easy phase separation at a later stage of the extraction procedure, but should be minimized at the beginning of the process. in order to avoid premature phase formation, glycerol was used to facilitate phenol solubility in the buffer. later on, phase separation is achieved by adding bcp , as previously described  <cit> .

after phase separation, protection of the extracted rna is reduced, since the phenol and guanidine salt concentrations will be lower. in order to avoid degradation from this point on in the process, we used both sodium acetate and edta as chelators to prevent divalent cation catalyzed rna degradation.

triton x- <dig> is a non ionic detergent used for protein solubilisation, membrane permeabilisation and cell lysis. it has been previously demonstrated that its use, in combination with chloroform and heat, is a viable strategy for rna extraction from both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . this method has been further modified by replacing chloroform extraction with an acid phenol extraction  <cit> . for these reasons we included triton x- <dig> in the pgtx extraction solution.

the pgtx solution has the following composition : phenol , glycerol , 8-hydroxyquinoline , edta , sodium acetate , guanidine thiocyanate , guanidine hydrochloride  and triton x- <dig> , and the final ph around  <dig> . at room temperature, the pgtx extraction mixture forms a monophasic solution.

evaluation of rna extraction yield, purity and integrity
the strategies followed for rna extraction are summarized in table  <dig>  during each experimental repetition, rna was extracted from  <dig> cell aliquots  for each of the methods investigated. the extracted rna yield and purity was then determined by measuring absorbance in the  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm range . from the resulting spectra, the concentration of nucleic acids was estimated using the absorbance values at  <dig> nm, while the purity of each sample was determined by calculating the 260/ <dig> and 260/ <dig> ratios .

description, for each method analysed, of basic chemistry and cell lysis strategy followed. bead beating and heat were used as described in methods. .

the highest yields were achieved using the "pgtx beads" and "trizol beads" methods – averaging  <dig>  μg/μl and  <dig>  μg/μl respectively. for "pgtx 95" the yield was  <dig>  μg/μl while for "trizol 95" the calculated concentration was  <dig>  μg/μl. the "trizol standard" procedure yielded  <dig>  μg/μl while the previously published method "bpc" resulted in a solution containing  <dig>  μg/μl of nucleic acids. the different yields are probably correlated with the ability of each method to promote cell lysis. for instance, when considering the use of trizol, we observed that combining it with bead beating is more effective than using heat or trizol alone . we also noted that, as opposed to bead beating, heating to 95°c does not result in an equal rna yield for trizol  and pgtx  – this difference is probably the result of composition differences that allow pgtx to promote more extensive cell lysis.

for the methods using pgtx, 260/ <dig> ratios had a value around  <dig>  – the expected value for a "pure" rna sample. the same was observed for trizol based methods, with a slightly lower ratio, close to  <dig> , when following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. for the "bpc" method the 260/ <dig> ratio was  <dig> , indicating putative dna contamination.

only for the "pgtx 95" and "bpc" methods were the 260/ <dig> ratios around  <dig>  – indicating a low levels of contaminantion with peptides, phenols, aromatic compounds or carbohydrates. for all other methods, these values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . noticeably, both the "trizol beads" and "trizol standard" presented a slight brownish coloration and an insoluble white precipitate . in figure  <dig> this can be seen as a tail of absorption stretching out to  <dig> nm and beyond in the spectra from the three trizol methods. visible spectra up to  <dig> nm were also collected and only showed continuously decreasing absorbance  and gave no further information about the origin of the coloured contamination.

in order to verify integrity, four rna samples for each of the extraction methods were analysed using an automated gel electrophoresis system . for all methods the expected 23s, 16s and 5s bands are observed – while rna integrity is kept for all extraction methods, the replicates of "bpc" presented high molecular weight smears. these were most probably genomic dna, since they were absent after dnase digestion .

detecting dna contamination
dna contamination of rna preparations is not necessarily detected by gel electrophoresis or similar methods. to test if a detectable amount of genomic dna was present after simulated rt reactions , the diluted rna samples were used as template for pcr using primers pairs for ftsz . after  <dig> cycles of pcr  only the "bpc" method resulted in detectable dna contamination. but these findings were unexpected, since we expect some level of genomic dna contamination for all extraction methods. in fact, after increasing the number of cycles from  <dig> to  <dig>  more pcr products were detected . overall, the least dna amplification was observed using the "trizol standard" protocol, while using the "bpc" method results in the highest genomic dna contamination.

sequence of primers used for this work. for genomic dna detection ftsz specific primers were used. during reverse transcriptase one tagged antisense oligonucleotide was used to prime cdna synthesis. pcr amplification of the cdna used one rbcl specific sense primer while the tag was used as an antisense primer.

performing rt-pcr
reverse transcriptase is known to be inhibited by endonucleases, exonucleases and photosynthetic pigments  <cit> , making rt-pcr a suitable test to determine if the extracted rna is suitable for common downstream applications. therefore, we performed rt-pcr using  <dig> μg of rna from each extraction method as template to synthesize and amplify rbcl specific cdna . to allow specific detection of mrna, independent of genomic dna contamination, we used tagged primers  <cit> .

suggested protocol for rna extraction
in light of the previous results, for the best combination of yield and rna extraction purity, we suggest the "pgtx 95" protocol outlined in figure  <dig>  a modification of the original trizol protocol. briefly, to a cyanobacterial cell pellet   <dig> ml of pgtx is added. after resuspending the cells, the screw-cap tubes are incubated at 95°c for  <dig> minutes. immediately after, the samples are placed on ice, again for a period of  <dig> minutes. after addition of  <dig> μl of bromochloropropane and incubation at room temperature, the extraction mix is centrifuged in order to promote phase separation. the aqueous phase is then retrieved and mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol, incubated at room temperature and centrifuged to concentrate the precipitated rna. the rna pellet is washed using 75% ethanol, air dried and finally dissolved in rna storage solution.

cost analysis for the different methods
the cost per sample for the different procedures was estimated taking in consideration only the cost of each phenol based disruption solution, based on sigma-aldrich list prices for sweden during february  <dig>  for the "bpc" method, the use of purchased buffer saturated phenol for rna costs from € <dig>  to € <dig>  per extraction . for the pgtx based methods the cost is € <dig>  . for trizol based extractions the cost per sample is € <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
cyanobacteria have an important amount of polysaccharides that interfere in cell lysis and nucleic acid purification  <cit> , while being rich in nucleases and enzymatic reaction inhibitors  <cit> . with this work we show that variations of extraction protocol, even while maintaining basic chemistry, can have an impact on rna yield and quality. while none of the extractions methods negatively impacted reverse transcriptase activity, we show that replacing bead beating with heating is feasible and maybe even preferable, as the level of contamination is lower and the method does not require the use of an expensive bead beater.

potentially even more cost reducing is pgtx – this extraction mixture has equivalent potential to trizol, while having only a fraction of the cost. we have also successfully used  pgtx to extract rna from several cyanobacteria  and green algae .
