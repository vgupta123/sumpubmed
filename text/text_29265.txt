BACKGROUND
parathyroid hormone  and pth-related peptide  belong to a family of endocrine factors with a highly conserved n-terminal region , which accounts for their overlapping functions in calcium homeostasis  <cit> . in mammals, single copy pth and pthrp genes are proposed to share common ancestry  <cit>  an idea reinforced by the identification of duplicate orthologous genes, pth <dig> and  <dig>  and pthrp <dig> and  <dig> in teleost fishes  <cit>  which underwent a specific genome duplication  <cit> . however, the recent identification of a novel pth-like  gene in teleosts throws into question previous evolutionary models for this gene family  <cit> .

in mammals, pth is a product of the parathyroid glands and pre-pro-pth is processed to liberate the biologically active mature  <dig> amino acid hormone, which regulates serum calcium through its direct actions in bone and kidney counteracting the action of calcitonin  <cit> . in contrast, pthrp is a pluripotent hormone which acts via intracellular, paracrine and endocrine pathways and regulates cell growth and differentiation, bone development and lactation, and embryonic and fetal development and survival  <cit> . tissue specific proteolytic processing of pthrp occurs and generates at least three active fragments  <cit> , of which only the n-terminal  fragment has a cognate family  <dig> g-protein coupled receptor, pth1r, which also binds pth  <cit> . moreover, alternative promoter utilization and exon splicing generates several different human pthrp isoforms which range in length from 139- <dig> amino acids  <cit> . in mammals, a second receptor  is activated by pth and tuberoinfundibular peptide  <dig> , while in teleost fish pth2r is only activated by tip <dig>  <cit> . moreover, in teleosts a paralogue of tetrapod pth1r  with affinity for pthrp also exists  <cit> .

pth and pthrp have been intensively studied in mammals but their function in other vertebrates is poorly documented. in amphibians, pth/pthrp receptors have been characterized and an immunoreactive pthrp-like peptide with widespread tissue distribution has been detected  <cit> . in chicken, pth and pthrp homologues have also been isolated and are involved in chondroblast and osteoblast differentiation, although their role in calcium transport mechanisms is poorly understood  <cit> . amphibians and birds occupy unique phylogenetic positions, the former at the transition of aquatic to terrestrial life, the latter at the transition to homeothermy, and both organisms have a complex system in calcium regulation. the presence of a parathyroid gland in frogs  coupled with their terrestrial/aquatic environment and the occurrence in birds of a hollow skeleton and heavily calcified eggs are examples of physiological/structural processes which influence calcium and phosphorus requirements.

the identification of new pth family members in xenopus sp.  and chicken, gallus gallus  by in silico analysis of public databases and gene cloning is reported. gene structure, gene linkage, alternative splicing and tissue specific transcription are also characterised. the calciotropic activity of xenopus and chicken n-terminal  peptides of pth family members in vitro are established using xenopus skin and chicken chorionallantois membranes. finally a model of pth gene family evolution is proposed and discussed in the context of functional divergence.

RESULTS
xenopus and chicken pth family members
homologues of vertebrate pth, pthrp and takifugu rubripes pth-l genes were identified or deduced in silico using the xenopus and chicken genomes  and validated by cdna cloning and sequencing . the xenopus and chicken pth-family members shared at least 30% amino acid sequence similarity to the takifugu mature proteins and 58% to the  n-terminal amino acid residues. sequence comparison of xenopus and chicken pth-family members with other vertebrate homologues revealed that specific sequence motifs are conserved . for example, the cleavage sites located before the mature protein in human pre-pro-pth and pthrp were conserved. characteristic proteolytic sites within the human pthrp protein, which generate three distinct peptides were also conserved: n-terminal pthrp, mid-region pthrp  and c-terminal pthrp   <cit>  . the first  <dig> n-terminal amino acids, involved in the calcitrophic action of the hormones is the most highly conserved domain. specific motifs such as, m-h-n in pth, and l-h-d in tetrapod pthrp and the amino acids important in receptor-binding in mammals, l <dig> and l <dig> are also conserved. additional conserved residues in xenopus and chicken pth-family members are v <dig>  q <dig>  h <dig> and r <dig> , suggesting they are important in peptide function from fish to mammals.

gene structure and transcript isoforms
comparison of gene structure indicates that amphibian and chicken pth and pth-l gene organization is conserved and that the peptide precursors are encoded by two separate exons  . in contrast, the gene structure of pthrp from xenopus and chicken is poorly conserved and  <dig> exons code for the mature protein. alternative splicing generates two distinct transcripts that differ in their 3' region and modify the predicted amino acid sequence of the c-terminal domain .

transcripts - pth
the xenopus pth gene was deduced in silico and revealed that exon  <dig> encodes the pre-pro-region of the protein and exon  <dig> the mature protein . xenopus pth cdna was amplified by rt-pcr from the intestine  and the predicted protein has  <dig> amino acids and yields a mature protein of  <dig> amino acids. it was not possible to establish the nucleotide sequence of the 5' and 3' utr of xenopus pth. the gene structure of chicken pth was identical to the amphibian homologue but no evidence of alternative splicing was found . chicken pth has  <dig> amino acids and is identical to the previously described cdna . two ests were identified  from cdna of a mixture of chicken tissues  and were identical to full-length pth .

transcripts - pthrp
the deduced xenopus pthrp gene is composed of at least  <dig> exons . the first putative exon contains the pre-pro-peptide and part of the 5'utr, although the full gene structure in this region remains to be elucidated. exon  <dig> encodes the mature protein and part of the 3'utr and yields xenopus pthrp . the largest xenpthrp transcript identified has  <dig> amino acids and results from intra-exon splicing of exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> as occurs in the homologue region  in the human pthrp gene. through alternative splicing, exon  <dig> donates  <dig> amino acids to the predicted protein and at least seven downstream exons generate a unique 3'utr domain. xenopus pthrp encodes the largest 3'utr region identified for this gene in vertebrates.

two previously published mrna   <cit>  encode xenpthrp 1- <dig> and 1- <dig> which share an identical amino acid sequence with the exception of two extra arginine  residues in the latter isoform contributed by exon  . two ests identified in the tailbud   encode a predicted xenpthrp of  <dig> amino acids which yields a mature protein of  <dig> amino acids . a second xenpthrp isoform encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids which generates a mature peptide of  <dig> amino acids  was predicted from analysis of genomic sequences. the existence of xenpthrp transcript was confirmed by rt-pcr of bone .

the deduced chicken pthrp gene is composed of at least  <dig> exons . the first three exons undergo alternative splicing and contain part of the 5'utr . exon  <dig> encodes the remaining 5'utr and part of the pre-pro-protein. the mature protein and part of the 3'utr of chicken pthrp are included in exon  <dig>  in common with human an intra-exon splice of exon  <dig> to  <dig> give rise to chicken pthrp. this final exon encodes for the last  <dig> amino acids of pthrp and the 3'utr.

several chicken pthrp  isoforms which differed in the 5' utr and coding region were identified amongst isolated ests . five ests  differing in their 5'utr region, encoded a ckpthrp of  <dig> amino acids . no ests for putative ckpthrp were identified in database searches although rt-pcr revealed it is expressed in several tissues .

transcripts - pth-l
the gene structure of xenopus pth-l has only been partly elucidated and was composed of at least two exons and appears to have an identical gene structure to pth. the deduced protein sequence of pth-l  is  <dig> amino acids .

two main transcripts for xenopus pth-l  were identified by clustering seven xenpth-l ests . one transcript  was represented by three ests from gastrula stages  <dig> - <dig>  and a mixture of brain and spinal cord from tadpoles stages 58- <dig> . the second transcript  was represented by four ests from gastrula stages  <dig> - <dig> . the deduced xenpth-l was  <dig> amino acids long and yielded a mature protein of  <dig> amino acids .

the chicken pth-l gene had a similar structure to the pth gene and was composed of two exons and one intron. no ests for ckpth-l were identified although rt-pcr indicated it is expressed in several tissues .

phylogenetic analysis
the topologies of phylogenetic trees constructed with neighbor joining or parsimony methods were similar and a consensus tree is presented . pth, pthrp and pth-l were separated into different clades and the xenopus and chicken pth-like family members clustered with their respective vertebrate homologues . in teleosts, a specific duplication of the pth and pthrp genes occurred although only one pth-l exists and this may be a consequence of; 1) deletion of the second copy from teleost genomes or 2) a partial duplication of teleost pth-like members. the isolation of homologues of takifugu pth-l gene in amphibian and chicken genomes suggests that members of the pth/pthrp family emerged prior to the teleost divergence and were subsequently maintained in vertebrate genomes. the exception is eutherian mammals which lack a pth-l gene.

short-range gene environment comparisons
to better understand the evolution of vertebrate pth family members, the gene environment of the xenopus and chicken genes were characterized and compared with the homologue regions in takifugu and human. short-range comparisons indicate that gene synteny and gene order were maintained across vertebrates suggesting that members of this family evolved under conservative pressures . the chicken and human homologue genome segments were the most highly conserved and similar linked genes were identified flanking pth-family members. the genes arntl and btbd <dig> were localized in close proximity to pth. genes mrps <dig> and sfrs <dig> were identified within the pthrp and pth-l homologue regions, respectively. the genes flanking pth-l in xenopus and chicken were identified on human chromosome  <dig>  although pth-l was lacking suggesting that specific gene/genome rearrangement events occurred during the mammalian radiation.

pth family genes expression
the tissue distribution and relative abundance of all xenopus and chicken pth family transcripts was investigated by rt-pcr  and q-pcr . pth and pthrp transcripts had a similar tissue distribution in both xenopus and chicken.

pth-l had a widespread tissue distribution in xenopus and the highest transcript abundance  was detected in brain, lung and bone . xenopus pthrp transcripts were detected in brain, lung, skin and heart and were low abundance in spleen and muscle . it was not possible to design q-pcr primers which discriminated between the two xenopus pthrp transcripts. however, rt-pcr  revealed both transcripts have a similar distribution. xenopus pth was expressed in bone, kidney, lung and nervous tissue . the presence of pth family members was not established in the amphibian parathyroid gland as its small size and variable morphology made it difficult to collect  <cit> .

in chicken, pth transcripts were highly abundant in the parathyroid gland , although they were also detected at low abundance in the pituitary, thyroid, bone and cartilage. chicken pthrp transcripts were widely expressed  and the various isoforms had a differential tissue distribution suggesting they may have different functional roles. ckpthrp5utrb and ckpthrp5utrc were the most abundant transcripts  and were mainly found in cartilage. ckpthrp5utrb, ckpthrp5utrc and ckpthrp5utrd transcripts had a similar tissue distribution. the tissue distribution of ckpthrp overlapped with ckpthrp5utra with the exception of cartilage in which the latter transcript was absent. ckpthrp was highly expressed in muscle and was the only isoform which was not detected in the parathyroid gland. it was also absent from bone together with ckpthrp5utra. in contrast, both isoforms were expressed in kidney where ckpthrp5utrb and pthrp5utrc were not detected. ckpth-l transcripts had a similar tissue distribution to ckpthrp  and were most abundant in cartilage but were also present in pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid glands, muscle, hind brain and kidney.

transepithelial calcium transport
the resistance and short-circuit current of xenopus abdominal skin and chicken cam membranes were substantially different . cam is a leaky epithelium and the frog skin is a tight epithelium and both have calcium transporting capacity. all xenopus and chicken  n-terminal peptides were able to increase unidirectional calcium fluxes from the apical/basolateral membrane site . xenpth changed calcium fluxes across xenopus abdominal skin from  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig>  xenpthrp from  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> and xenpth-l from  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> . a significant increase in short-circuit current  was observed after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of exposure of xenopus abdominal skin to xenpthrp and xenpth-l, respectively which suggests these peptides may also be involved in the transport of other ions in the skin . this possibility was tested by comparing theoretical and measured short-circuit current using the formula isc = ji.z.f   <cit> . for pthrp the calculated value for isc  was  <dig>  vs. the measured value  <dig> . for pth-l the calculated value for isc was  <dig>  vs. the measured value  <dig> . the values of isc for the two peptides are within the same range. the difference between calculated and measured values of isc is indicative of an additional transport mechanism responsive to both peptides, e.g. secretion of anions .

note: isc ; rt ; * indicates statistically significant difference from time =  <dig> control 

ckpth doubled calcium flux through cam from  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig>  ckpthrp from  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> and ckpth-l from  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> to  <dig>  nmol.h- <dig> cm <dig> . human pth induced a significant increase in transepithelial calcium transport in chicken cam but had no effect on xenopus abdominal skin . salmon lhrh was used as a negative control and had no effect on calcium transport in either skin or cam confirming the specificity of the effects observed with the chicken and xenopus peptides.

discussion
in the current study, three pth family members, pth, pthrp and prh-l, were characterized in xenopus and chicken. preliminary functional analysis suggests the action on calcium uptake of the  n-terminal region is conserved in pth family members. comparison of sequence, structure and gene environment suggests they have evolved by gene duplication and deletion events. moreover, a number of novel pthrp splice variants with a variable 5'utr were also identified. all three pth family members are present in teleost and tetrapod genomes with the exception of eutherian mammals which have lost the pth-l gene, probably because of specific gene or genome rearrangements during the mammalian radiation. this hypothesis is supported by the conservation in human chromosome  <dig> of genes linked to pth-l in fish, xenopus and chicken. phylogenetic analysis supports previous theories that pth-like family members evolved from a common ancestral precursor, from which tuberoinfundibular peptide  <dig>  has also been suggested to have arisen  <cit> . to date, pth family homologues remain to be identified in invertebrates and their emergence in vertebrates coupled with their important role in calcium homeostasis and skeletal development suggest that their origin may be associated with the acquisition of a calcified endoskeleton.

analysis of pth family members in xenopus and chicken indicates that similar post-translation modifications to those previously described for the human homologue occur  <cit> . the bioactive n-terminal  peptide of pth family members is the most conserved region of the protein . the physicochemical properties of amino acids in the n-terminal region including l <dig> and l <dig> which are important for receptor activation  <cit> , are maintained in xenopus and chicken suggesting they may have similar functional roles across the vertebrates. moreover, within this region the highest conservation is found in the first residues. previous studies comparing activation of teleost and human pthr by pthrp and pth suggests they have distinct activation profiles and indicate the c-terminal region of the protein is also involved  <cit> .

in addition to amino acid sequence conservation, the gene organization of xenopus and chicken pth and pth-l is also maintained   <cit> . however, although pth-l splice isoforms have been found in xenopus and takifugu  <cit>  no alternative pth splice isoforms have been identified in any species to date. in contrast, the gene structure of pthrp is poorly conserved between vertebrates and unique xenopus and chicken isoforms which result from exon skipping events, were identified and resemble those reported for the human gene  <cit> . in human, three pthrp transcripts are expressed as a result of alternative promoter usage, two of which  are identical in size to those present in chicken. the only difference between the mature proteins in both human and chicken is the presence in the 1- <dig> pthrp isoform of two extra c-terminal amino acids . in xenopus a unique pthrp splice isoform results from a splice event within the osteostatin region and the incorporation of a novel coding sequence and 3'utr giving rise to a longer peptide precursor . in contrast, to terrestrial vertebrates including xenopus where splice variants of pth family members are common, none were identified in teleosts. variation in the utr has been associated with tissue-specific  <cit> , developmental stage or cell state specific  <cit>  regulatory mechanisms. the existence of splice variants suggests that complex regulatory mechanisms for this gene family were acquired within the tetrapod radiation and this may be related to the change in mineral homeostasis which accompanied the adaptation of vertebrates to a terrestrial environment  <cit> .

the presence of distinct xenopus and chicken pthrp isoforms and their widespread distribution and expression in bone, cartilage, skin and kidney  further supports their role as important calciotropic factors. the pthrp transcripts identified in chicken are predicted to produce mature proteins with the same length as the human pthrp and pthrp proteins, although no homologue of the human pthrp was identified suggesting it may be a human innovation. the xenopus and chicken pthrp and pth-l tissue expression overlaps in the majority of the tissues analysed suggesting widespread paracrine actions for the two proteins.

pth distribution is more restricted and in chicken, as expected, is expressed abundantly and almost exclusively in the parathyroid gland . in xenopus, we were not able to identify the parathyroid tissue and it has previously been noted to be inconspicuous and readily degenerates  <cit> . in chicken pth expression was also detected in the pituitary gland and in xenopus brain/pituitary extracts, which is in agreement with studies which showed that immunoactive protein was detected in pituitaries from sheep  <cit> , and fish  <cit>  . pth immunoreactivity in brain and pituitary was also reported for several tetrapods, including chicken  <cit> , but so far has only been confirmed in rabbit and rat brain/pituitary. taken together these results suggest a high degree of conservation of pituitary pth expression and possibly secretion across vertebrates, although in mouse the thymus is also a source of pth  <cit> . pth expression in xenopus lung has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported. however, the overall pth tissue distribution largely coincides with the two pth/pthrp receptors identified in this organism  <cit> . this supports the hypothesis that pth may have a more paracrine action in lower vertebrates.

although there was an overlapping tissue distribution of some of the transcripts of the three pth family members, expression of pth and pth-l, unlike pthrp, is more restricted . the pthrp isoforms identified in chicken seem to conform to specific patterns and levels of abundance, although only one of the transcripts produces a different protein. with the exception of chicken pthrp5utra, the other chicken pthrp are expressed in cartilage at high levels confirming their important role in this tissue  <cit> . however, in xenopus pthrp transcript seemed to be absent from cartilage. the different tissue expression profiles of pth family members in xenopus and chicken  suggest that specific modulation of gene expression occurs and detailed analysis of the promoter region may help clarify this question.

all xenopus and chicken pth-like peptides were found to promote unidirectional calcium influx . the differing effect of human pth in chicken and xenopus is in keeping with what has been previously observed for the bovine peptide  <cit> . however, after pre-treatment with vitamin d, bovine pth is also able to stimulate calcium transport across the rana pipiens skin epithelium  <cit> . xenopus pth-l and chicken pth peptides were the most effective in promoting calcium transport across the membranes in each specific assay. similar results were obtained for transport across teleost larvae epithelia  <cit>  and although more studies are required to establish their specific function, the results provide new insight into the interlink between evolution and function of the pth family.

although the three peptides enhance calcium transport, only pthrp and pth-l caused changes in the short-circuit current in xenopus skin, indicating an additional effect on transport of ions other than calcium . similar effects on the short-circuit current in the same range of pth concentrations have previously been observed with a <dig> cells derived from xenopus kidney  <cit> ; on sodium transport of pt cells derived from chicken kidney  <cit> ; and with pthrp on fish intestine  <cit> . our results further substantiate the effect of the pth family of proteins on the short-circuit current and suggest that the action of the different peptides on the short-circuit current is tissue dependent and may vary with species.

while pthrp and pth genes have been identified in teleosts and tetrapods, pth-l seems to be absent from eutherian mammals and it was recently suggested to be the functional homologue of mammalian pth, in fish  <cit> . in the present study, xenopus pth-l in common with teleost pth-l, was the most potent peptide promoting calcium transport across epithelia. in chicken, a different scenario was observed and pth seemed to be more efficient in stimulating calcium transport. taking into consideration a) the reduced calciotropic activity of pth-l in chicken, b) the overlapping distribution between pth-l and pthrp and c) the absence of a pth-l in the human genome , it is proposed that a transitory functional role between the vertebrate pth-l and the tetrapod pthrp and pth occurred after the amphibian divergence. the tetrapod pth-l probably acquired a minor role and became potentially non-functional and was consequently eliminated from the human genome. in contrast, pth which in teleosts and xenopus appears to be a paracrine factor seems to have gained a more important functional role during evolution and became a major endocrine factor with a restricted production in a highly specialized structure, the parathyroid gland  <cit> . future studies using more in depth functional studies and other organisms will be needed to support this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the parathyroid hormone family contains  <dig> principal members, pth, pthrp and the recently identified pth-l. in teleosts there are  <dig> genes which encode pthrp , pth  and pth-l and in tetrapods there are  <dig> genes , the exception is placental mammals which have  <dig> genes and lack a pth-l. gene structure of pth and pth-l seems to be conserved throughout the vertebrates while pthrp gene structure is divergent and it has acquired new exons and alternative promoters. the highly conserved xenopus and chicken n-terminal  region of pth, pthrp and pth-l has the capacity to stimulate calcium uptake across, respectively, the frog skin and chicken chorionallantois membranes, indicating a conserved role in calcium metabolism possibly via similar receptors. it is hypothesized that pth family genes appeared at approximately the same time during the vertebrate radiation and evolved via gene duplication/deletion events. during evolution pth-l was lost from the genome of eutherian mammals, while pth, which has a paracrine distribution in lower vertebrates, became the product of a specific endocrine tissue, the parathyroid gland and gained an important role in calcium regulation. the pthrp gene acquired during its evolution a disparate and more complex organization in vertebrates probably associated with its paracrine nature and pluripotent functions.
