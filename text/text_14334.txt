BACKGROUND
mannan-binding lectin , a member of the collectin family in the c-type lectin superfamily, is a multimeric protein containing collagen-like sequences. it is synthesized and secreted into the blood by hepatocytes. it has the overall 'bundle-of-tulips' structure first described for c1q  <cit> . the mbl polypeptide comprises four domains: a cysteine-rich n-terminal domain, a collagen-like region  that contains gly-x-y repeats , a neck region and a c-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain   <cit> . the mbl polymer is composed of as many as six homogenous subunits  <cit> , but only the more highly polymeric forms have biological activity and can fix complement.

dendritic cells  are highly efficient antigen-presenting cells that play a central role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses to pathogens  <cit> . in their immature form , they can capture antigen very efficiently by macropinocytosis, endocytosis  <cit> , and phagocytosis  <cit>  through different cell surface molecules, e.g. mannose receptor, toll-like receptors  or scavenger receptors. to elicit an immune response, dcs must undergo a maturation process, which is initiated by inflammatory signals and is completed after contact with t cells. maturation enables dcs to migrate from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs and to acquire a very potent antigen-presenting capacity. mature dcs are also the initial and most prominent source of the cytokines that govern the development of th <dig> responses . dc maturation is known to be induced by several stimuli, including bacterial components , heat shock proteins, viral products  and endogenous factors such as inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

it has been reported that other members of the soluble defensive collagen family such as surfactant protein a , surfactant protein d  and complement c1q, have roles in immune regulation by interacting with various cells. for instance, sp-a inhibits the differentiation and maturation of dcs  <cit>  and modulates cellular responses induced by lps through interacting with cd <dig>  <cit> ; sp-a suppresses tnf-α secretion from alveolar macrophages stimulated by lps  <cit> , and sp-a-deficient mice produce significantly more tnf-α than wild-type mice after intratracheal lps administration  <cit> . sp-d enhances bacterial antigen presentation by bone marrow-derived dcs  <cit> . c1q regulates lps-induced cytokine production in bone marrow-derived dcs  <cit>  and induces maturation of human dcs  <cit> .

as a key soluble pattern recognition molecule in the innate immune system, mbl has been reported to influence the cytokine network after stimulation by various microorganisms  <cit> . to date, however, little knowledge has been obtained about its role in the regulation of adaptive response. since dcs play key roles in initiating adaptive responses, it will be useful to know whether and how this member of the collectin family regulates lps-induced biological functions and the possible mechanisms in dcs.

RESULTS
purification of mbl
mbl was purified from pooled human plasma samples containing high concentrations . sds-page and western blotting showed that the highly purified mbl was a functional multimer composed of 32kd peptide chains . it was highly bioactive, as demonstrated by a ligand-binding assay and yeast coagulation .

mbl suppresses lps-induced mdc maturation
it is well known that dc maturation is induced by lps. during dc maturation, the expression of receptors required for phagocytosis is down-regulated, whereas mhcii and co-stimulatory molecules such as cd <dig> and cd <dig> are up-regulated  <cit> . to investigate whether mbl influences dc maturation, immdcs were stimulated with smooth lps  in the presence of increasing concentrations of mbl  for  <dig> days. cell maturation was assessed by flow cytometry . as shown in figure  <dig>  lps induced elevated expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and mhc ii, but these effects were strongly inhibited by mbl at higher concentrations  compared with the corresponding cells without mbl treatment ; hsa  and lower mbl concentrations  had no such effect. inclusion of anti-mbl polyclonal antibody  during the preincubation of the cells with mbl restored the expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and mhc ii on dcs , indicating that mbl specifically inhibited the interaction between lps and immdcs.

mbl inhibits tnf-α and il- <dig> p40+p <dig> production from lps-stimulated mdcs
immdcs were stimulated with lps and exhibited maximal response to secreted proinflammatory cytokines such as il- <dig> and tnf-α . cytokines produced by mdcs are known to be important in regulating the adaptive immune response, directing it to either the th <dig> or the th <dig> pathway. to investigate whether mbl affects cytokine production by mdcs stimulated with lps, immdcs were stimulated with lps  in the presence of increasing concentrations of mbl  for  <dig> h, and the supernatants were analyzed by elisa. as shown in figure  <dig>  the inductions of tnf-α and il- <dig> p40+p <dig> by lps were strongly inhibited by mbl at higher concentrations , compared with the corresponding immdcs without mbl treatment , but hsa  and lower mbl concentrations  had no such effect. inclusion of anti-mbl pab during the preincubation of the cells with mbl restored the secretion of tnf-α and il- <dig> p40+p <dig> , indicating that the inhibitory effect of mbl is specific.

mbl attenuates allogeneic t cell proliferation induced by lps-stimulated mdcs
as mature dcs are known to be the most potent t cell activators, we next tested whether mbl affects the proliferative response of allogeneic t cells induced by lps-stimulated mdcs. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  t lymphocytes induced by lps-stimulated mdcs co-cultured with mbl  showed significantly lower proliferation than the corresponding mdcs without mbl treatment ; hsa  had no effect. in control samples, mdcs incubated in medium only or primed with lps were used for the mixed lymphocyte reaction. inclusion of anti-mbl pab during the preincubation of the cells with mbl restored allogeneic t cell proliferation , further indicating the specific inhibitory effect of mbl.

mbl attenuates the binding of lps to immdcs
we next examined whether mbl altered lps binding to immdcs. when the cells were incubated at 4°c with labeled smooth lps , significant lps binding was observed on the cell surface . after the cells were preincubated with mbl , this cell-surface binding of the labeled smooth lps was significantly attenuated . inclusion of anti-mbl pab during the preincubation of the cells with mbl restored the binding of smooth lps to the cell surface , indicating that mbl specifically inhibits the interaction between smooth lps and the immdcs.

we also checked whether mbl itself can bind to the lps used in present experiments. the results showed that mbl bound to rough lps from e. coli o111: b <dig> mutant  but not to smooth lps from e. coli o111: b <dig> , suggesting that the mbl-immdcs interaction rather than an mbl-lps interaction affects the lps-induced cellular responses.

ca2+-dependent binding of mbl to immdcs
when immdcs were incubated with biotinylated mbl at physiological calcium concentrations , there was definite but slight mbl binding to the cells, as demonstrated by fcm . at higher ca2+ concentrations the binding was markedly increased ; also, the binding was markedly reduced in the absence of ca2+ . these results showed that mbl interacted with immdcs in a ca2+-dependent manner.

mbl inhibits nf-κb dna-binding and translocation in immdcs
the next question is whether mbl modulates lps-induced signaling as a consequence of its interaction with surface molecules on immdcs. therefore, we investigated the effects of mbl on lps-induced nf-κb activation in immdcs, using two methods: electrophoretic mobility shift assay  and western blotting. for emsa, when nuclear extracts from lps-stimulated immdcs were incubated with p <dig> nf-κb probe, nf-κb binding was enhanced within  <dig> h after lps-stimulation, and mbl  reduced the dna binding activity; dna binding was restored by including anti-mbl pab . this binding of the complex was specific because it could be competed away with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled consensus nf-κb oligonucleotide . for western blotting, analysis of corresponding nuclear fractions using anti-p <dig> ab confirmed that lps significantly increased nf-κb translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in immdcs, and treatment with  <dig> μg/ml mbl strongly inhibited this effect . inclusion of anti-mbl pab restored nf-κb translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , further indicating the specific inhibitory effect of mbl on the interaction between smooth lps and the immdcs.

discussion
this study demonstrates a new biological function of mbl in regulating lps-induced mdcs maturation and cytokine production. mbl bound to immdcs at physiological calcium concentrations, but binding was optimal at supraphysiological concentrations. furthermore, direct binding of mbl to immdcs attenuated the binding of lps to the cell surface and decreased lps-induced nf-κb activity, suggesting that it affected mdc functions by modifying the lps-induced cellular responses.

dcs are professional apcs that are crucial in the initiation of adaptive immunity  <cit> . they recognize pathogens through pattern recognition receptors  that are triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, leading to dc maturation. maturation is a key process in dc biology and determines whether an immune response or tolerance will be initiated upon interaction with a given antigen. it is well accepted that imdcs induce t cell tolerance by inducing regulatory t cells  <cit> . to determine whether mbl affects lps-induced mdc maturation, immdcs were cultivated with mbl at a range of final concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> μg/ml. the results showed that cells treated with high mbl concentrations  expressed significantly less cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and mhc ii than the corresponding mdcs stimulated with lps only. in addition, the proliferation of allogeneic t lymphocytes induced by lps-treated mdcs was significantly inhibited when they were co-cultured with  <dig> μg/ml mbl, suggesting that mbl could regulate adaptive immune systems by modulating dc maturation.

recently macdonald et al.  <cit>  reported that rhmbl did not directly influence dc differentiation or maturation. mature dcs, prepared in the presence of rhmbl and subsequently co-cultured with allogeneic mononuclear cells, markedly promoted the production of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α in vitro. this influence required the presence of rhmbl during dc maturation and was critically dependent on the presence of monocytes. however, the data presented in this study demonstrate that mbl suppresses dc maturation and cytokine secretion in the presence of lps in vitro, suggesting that mbl may act differently under different  conditions and shows much versatility in regulating cellular immunity in addition to its established role as an opsonin.

it has been recognized that the nature of the innate immune response significantly influences the nature of the subsequent adaptive immune response. both soluble and membrane-bound prrs of the innate immune system assess the level of danger of a particular intrusion and initiate a program of protection for the host  <cit> . phagocytic cells  mediate some of these changes, when activated by pathogens, which often initiate the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . the cytokine environment then influences the subsequent specific immune responses. this study provides strong evidence that mbl at higher concentrations , but not at lower concentrations , significantly inhibits lps-induced tnf-α and il- <dig> p40+p <dig> production, indicating that could affect the adaptive immune response by modulating the cytokine network.

it is known that mouse mbl-a interacts with the rough but not the smooth lps  <cit> . estabrook et al.  <cit>  and sprong et al.  <cit>  also proved that human mbl did not interact with lps. in the present study, smooth lps was used to avoid interference from any lps-mbl interaction. we also demonstrated that mbl itself did not bind to the smooth lps used in this study. this evidence strongly supports the view that the mbl-immdc interaction rather than the mbl-lps interaction affects lps-induced cellular responses.

the functional mbl receptor expressed by many cell types is still controversial. as a major soluble prr in the innate immune system, mbl has long been known to recognize pathogens or autologous apoptotic cells via its crd and to interact with autologous cells via its clr. it was believed that the crd does not interact with normal autologous cells, but recently downing et al.  <cit>  reported calcium-dependent mbl binding to autogeneic b lymphocytes, monocytes and immdcs via its c-type lectin-binding site, suggesting a new role of mbl in the immune system. in this study, there was clear evidence to demonstrate that mbl binds immdcs at physiological calcium concentrations, though the binding was optimal at supraphysiological concentrations. sp-a directly interacts with tlr <dig> and md- <dig> and regulates inflammatory cellular responses  <cit> , and mbl and lung collectins interact with tlr <dig> and md- <dig> by different mechanisms  <cit> . as lps/tlr- signaling pathways are crucial for controlling the early inflammatory response and tlr <dig> is critical for lps recognition and signaling  <cit> , we presumed that tlr <dig> might be directly involved in mbl binding to the cell surface. it is also well known that lps recognition is a complex process involving cooperation of several molecules such as lbp, cd <dig> and md <dig>  which enhance tlr <dig> signaling. rat mbl might interact with cd <dig>  <cit> . therefore, other cell surface molecules might play a role through binding to mbl. however, the molecular mechanisms by which mbl interacts with cells need to be investigated further.

lps-activated cells sometimes induce microcirculatory dysfunction as well as inflammatory changes, which cause injury to various tissues, circulatory failure, and occasionally death  <cit> . to prevent excessive and prolonged responses by host innate immune cells to lps, the host may acquire a down-regulating system, lps tolerance, which ensures safe responses to lps and/or unresponsiveness to a second stimulation  <cit> . the fact that mbl at higher concentrations inhibits lps-induced dc maturation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion suggests that it could provide such down-regulation in an inflammatory situation. in addition, the mbl preparation used in this study was determined without endotoxin by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, ruling out lps tolerance induced by endotoxin contamination in the mbl preparations.

the serum concentration of mbl normally ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml  <cit> , but as an acute-phase protein, this can increase from  <dig> - to 3-fold in patients during an acute phase response  <cit> . the serum levels of mbl in patients with rheumatic heart disease increased significantly up to  <dig> μg/ml  <cit> . mbl is also present in such extravascular milieux as synovial fluid, amniotic fluid, lung and vaginal lavages  <cit> , and behaves as an acute-phase reactant in individuals with 'sufficient'  mbl genotypes  <cit> . therefore, we presume that mbl binding to autologous cells is most likely to take place at inflammatory loci, where local elevation of the extravascular mbl concentration and a concomitant influx of immune system cells are to be expected. the data presented in this paper showed that lps-induced mdc functions were significantly modulated by mbl at higher concentrations  but not at lower concentrations . therefore, by analogy, we presume that further investigations could provide evidence that, in the acute phase, high-concentration mbl is secreted to affect cytokine-mediated immune regulation in the serum as well as locally in some extravascular tissues.

therefore, these results suggest that mbl might have anti-inflammatory effects in pathological states. as a common exogenous pathogenic factor, lps is not only a major mediator in the systemic inflammatory response and sepsis, but also a strong activator of monocytes, macrophages and dcs. during inflammatory shock, lps stimulates monocytes to produce excessive inflammatory mediators and their cascade reactions, leading to multiple organ failure. numerous studies have confirmed that the imbalanced cytokines mediating the interaction of natural and acquired immunity contribute to human sepsis and immune dysfunctions. overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines  results in sustained sepsis, shock, and even death  <cit> . in this study, higher concentrations of mbl inhibited lps-induced dc maturation and the secretion of such proinflammatory cytokines as tnf-α and il- <dig>  indicating that mbl might be implicated in the anti-inflammatory effect and immunoregulation, reducing the incidence of shock and prevent endotoxemia-induced death. this study paves the way for a novel treatment of inflammatory shock by modulating excessive activated dcs with mbl.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we demonstrated in this study that mbl could attenuate mdcs maturation and cytokine production induced by lps. mbl also bound directly to immdcs and attenuated the binding of lps to the cell surfaces, resulting in decreased lps-induced nuclear nf-κb activity in these cells. all these data suggest that mbl could affect the functions of dcs by modifying lps-induced cellular responses. this study supports an important role for mbl in the regulation of adaptive immune responses and inflammatory responses.
