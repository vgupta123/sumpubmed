BACKGROUND
cereals are of immense importance to humankind with over  <dig> million tonnes being harvested annually and used for food, livestock feed and industrial raw materials. these uses exploit the reserves of starch and protein, which are deposited in the endosperm which accounts for about 80% of the mature grain. hence, grain yield and end use quality are largely determined by thesize and composition of the endosperm.

the endosperm is formed by a second fertilisation within the embryo sac, with two central cell nuclei and one pollen nucleus fusing to give a triploid constitution. subsequent cereal endosperm development can be divided into a number of stages  <cit> . the first of these is free nuclear division which occurs within the primary endosperm cell to give a coenocyte which, in wheat, may contain over  <dig>  nuclei by  <dig> hours after fertilisation  <cit> . cellularisation then occurs over a period of about  <dig> hours, followed by a period of about  <dig> days during which cell division, expansion and differentiation occur to give the characteristic structure of the endosperm with a total of up to  <dig>  cells  <cit> .

a major transition point occurs at about  <dig> days after fertilisation in wheat grown in temperate climates, marking essentially the end of endosperm cell division  <cit>  and the start of grain filling  in these cells. after about  <dig> days the deposition of storage reserves decreases and the grain starts to desiccate, reaching physiological maturity at about  <dig> days and harvest ripeness 1– <dig> weeks after this. however, the duration of these phases differ greatly between climates with the maximum dry weight being achieved by approximately  <dig> days in n. america  <cit> .

transcriptomics have been used to relate transcript abundance to these changes in developing wheat and barley grain. microarrays of wheat cdna  <cit>  and a macroarray of barley cdna elements  <cit>  have been used to follow selected parts of the transcriptome. alternatively, opensystems based on counts of sequences have been applied by kawaura et al.  <cit>  who classified the expression patterns of two groups of storage protein genes from est abundances and mcintosh et al.  <cit> who used serial analysis of gene expression  on developing wheat grain. the two approaches are complimentary; arrays allow greater resolution of expression differences and ease of comparison from a fixed platform, whereas sequencing approaches allow discovery of novel transcripts.

although cdna-based arrays provide valuable information they give only partial coverage of the genome, for example, laudencia-chingcuanco et al.  <cit>  used a cdna array of  <dig>  elements but the total number of genes in hexaploid bread wheat probably exceeds  <dig> . the wheat affymetrix genechip® array comprises over  <dig>  sets of eleven  <dig> mers  representing  <dig>  wheat transcripts and may cover half of the wheat expressed genes. this platform has been used to study the transcriptomics of meiosis in wheat  <cit>  and, in the first e-qtl study in wheat, to identify loci controlling seed development  <cit> . affymetrix arrays have significant advantages over cdna arrays in terms of data quality and ease of comparison between samples. in particular, it is known that the homoeologous genes from the three genomes of wheat can be expressed with different spatial and temporal specificities  <cit> ; while cdna array elements would be expected to cross-hybridise with these different transcripts, the multiple, short probes of the affymetrix platform could in principle distinguish them  <cit> . we have therefore used this new resource in order to identify transcripts associated with grain development and filling in wheat.

grain development is associated with massive changes in gene expression andany comparisons between genotypes or environments therefore needs to place the results in a developmental context. the data reported here constitute a reference data set to allow this as illustrated with an experiment on effects of heat and drought treatments on the wheat grain transcriptome. the dataset can also be exploited for further studies of grain development; here we have chosen to focus on transcription factors as key regulators of transcription.

RESULTS
the selected winter wheat cultivar, hereward, was released in the uk in  <dig>  but is still widely grown and has remained a "gold standard" for breadmaking wheats.

grain development of cv. hereward
approximately  <dig>  of the  <dig>  probesets on the array showed significant binding to transcripts and, of these,  <dig>  showed significant differences in transcript abundance between developmental stages. . the profiles of this latter set during grain development are summarised with the changes in seed dry and fresh weights in figure  <dig>  hierarchical cluster analysis of the whole dataset  shows that biological replicate samples cluster together, with successive changes in the patterns from  <dig> to  <dig> daa. furthermore, three broad phases are indicated, with the samples from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days, and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days forming separate clusters.

these phases can also be seen in the highly distinctive pattern of normalised transcript abundance  which shows massive changes in expression for many genes in the switch from 10– <dig> days and again from  <dig> to  <dig> days. similar changes can be seen in the smaller set  of differentially regulated transcripts identified by cdna arrays  <cit>  and in the profiles of the  <dig> most abundant sage tags  <cit> .

it is useful to aggregate genes with similar expression profiles to find if probesets with particular properties are over-represented in these clusters. the dataset comprised hundreds of statistically significant different gene expression profiles, but for display purposes we chose to aggregate these into the  <dig> sets shown in figure  <dig> using the self-organising map algorithm. this is appropriate for an overview display as it places similar gene clusters next to each other, so each dimension represents a progressive change in the expression profile of the cluster.

in order to associate the gene clusters with biological processes, we assigned probesets to ten process categories chosen to be of most relevance to grain development . whereas most probesets could be identified in terms of their molecular function , only 38% of them could reliably be associated with these processes. the number of probesets in each category are summarised for each cluster in the left hand pie charts shown in figure  <dig>  whole developing caryopses comprise three main types of tissue: the endosperm, the embryo and the outer, maternal  tissues. we therefore assigned putative tissue locations to  <dig> of the transcripts based on published biochemical studies of the encoded proteins and on the locations reported in the barley transcriptome study of sreenivasulu et al.  <cit> , who analysed separate pericarp, endosperm and embryo tissues. additional information on tissue locations came from the in situ hybridisation database of drea et al.  <cit> . the putative locations of the transcripts in each set are summarised in the right hand pie charts in figure  <dig>  the assignment of probesets to process and tissue classifications are available .

based on their putative assignments of function and tissue location it is possible to relate the changes in gene expression profiles to stages of grain development. an overall pattern is immediately apparent with embryo transcripts tending to increase throughout development , endosperm transcripts tending to increase to a plateau starting at  <dig> daa  and some endosperm and pericarp transcripts decreasing through development .

the cellularisation of the coenocytic endosperm is usually complete between  <dig> and  <dig> days after anthesis and is followed by a period of active cell division, expansion and differentiation to establish the starchy endosperm and aleurone tissues. the embryo develops more slowly than the endosperm duringthis period while the pericarp remains metabolically active. this phase corresponds to the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> day samples in our analysis and many of the transcripts which are expressed most highly during this earliest period  are associated with the endosperm and pericarp and with cell division, photosynthesis and development rather than storage product  synthesis.

grain filling is initiated at about  <dig> daa and continues until about  <dig> days. this is associated with very high abundance of specific transcripts  but these are only represented by about  <dig> distinct probesets. as a result, and because the data shown in figure  <dig> are normalised to median gene expression for display purposes, the dominance of these transcripts during grain fill is not apparent. however, this is clear when our data are expressed on an absolute basis  and confirms results from other transcriptomics approaches , which show storage protein transcripts to be the most abundant in developing seeds of wheat  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . these transcripts tend to reach a maximal level at around  <dig> daa which is maintained  until  <dig> daa.

many transcripts associated with the pericarp and photosynthesis decline steadily from the start of the sampling ; however others maintain a more constant level of expression throughout the developmental series .

in contrast, the majority of embryo transcripts continue to rise until the end of the sampling period . transcripts expressed highly during this latter period include many related to defence and stress , in agreement with sage results  <cit> . the stress transcripts may relate to embryo desiccation; for example, dehydrins are exclusively in group1_ <dig>  during this same period  there are decreases in transcripts associated with the endosperm and pericarp .

several clusters show more subtle, albeit significant, changes in expression throughout development associated with all three tissues  or with the endosperm and pericarp . these four clusters include many transcripts encoding proteins expected to be present in almost every cell type, e.g. mitochondrial proteins, machinery for protein synthesis and degradation, enzymes of primary metabolism.

all clusters contain a small proportion  of probesets that are in the antisense orientation when compared to coding rice sequences. these presumably function to down-regulate the sense transcript in vivo, many of which seem to be involved in protein synthesis and degradation . a similar fraction of transcripts was identified as being antisense using sage technology on developing wheat grain  <cit> .

the clusters identified here can be compared with those reported in other transcriptome analyses of developing wheat  <cit>  and barley  <cit>  grain by identifying similar sequences . the separation into a small number of gene clusters is to some extent arbitrary and dependent on choice of algorithm; nevertheless some trends are clear, e.g. cluster 3_ <dig> is very similar to mcintosh et al. cluster 2j , sreenivasulu et al. cluster  <dig>  and laudencia-chingcuanco et al. cluster  <dig>  those clusters that have similarities in sequence composition , also show similar average expression profiles. this shows some conservation of effects across conditions and between wheat and barley. however, it is noticeable that the size of changes in apparent transcript abundance observed here are often greater than in these other experiments. possibly the est-based platforms tend to integrate across several similar transcripts thus giving a damped signal compared with the oligonucleotide-based affymetrix platform  <cit> .

effects of environmental factors on grain development
environmental factors are known to have effects on wheat grain development, with impacts on both yield and end-use quality  <cit> . the effects of heat, drought and heat & drought on the grain transcriptome profile of cv. hereward, were therefore studied, selecting a highest temperature of 28°c. this temperature is sufficient to affect yield and quality  <cit>  but substantially below temperatures which are known to affect wheat storage protein gene expression  <cit> . the plants were grownin controlled environment  cabinets and subjected to different conditions from  <dig> daa.

the ce datasets show the same trends as observed in the developmental series but are accelerated, especially in hot and hot & dry conditions, as shown by the average expression of gene clusters  or by gene sets where the likely tissue of expression is known .  thus the abundances of embryo-associated transcripts increase throughout while those of endosperm-associated transcripts increase to a plateau. these changes occur faster in the heat treated samples and the late decreases in endosperm associated transcripts are greatly exaggerated in the  <dig> daa heat treated samples . the pericarp-associated transcripts decreased steeply till  <dig> daa then more gradually .

these environmental effects on development are expected since temperature is known to accelerate development and measures such as thermal time have been used in order to quantitise this effect. drought can also accelerate grain development due to stomatal closure, which reduces transpirational cooling, and due to increases in the rate of desiccation. it is possible to accurately quantify these effects on the transcriptome from the array data by estimating the equivalent stage in the developmental series for each of the ce experiment samples. this was done by calculating a distance measure between the ce samples and the interpolated developmental series . the value of daa which gives the minimum distance is an estimate of the developmental stage of the  <dig> samples . these estimates are not sensitive to changes in the sample of probesets used, as shown by the results of a bootstrapping procedure.

this analysis showed that the developmental stage of ce samples at  <dig> daa  is equivalent to about 20– <dig> daa in the developmental series; this is expected as the temperature regime used was 23°c/15°c day/night compared to 18°c/15°c in the developmental series. the variation in equivalent daa probably reflects differences between the separate cabinets used.

increasing the temperature to 28°c/20°c day/night or reducing the water to 44% field capacity both accelerated development over the first seven days of treatment as the control samples progressed the equivalent of  <dig> days, the dry  <dig> days, the hot  <dig> days and the hot & dry  <dig> days. after  <dig> days treatment  the control sample was equivalent to  <dig> daa and the other three samples had progressed beyond the final sample taken in the developmental series . the trends  show that the treatments continued to accelerate development, with the size of effect being dry < hot < hot & dry.

altenbach and kothari  <cit>  showed that the effect of temperature on expression of some selected genes in wheat grain was consistent with the acceleration of physiological markers of development. our estimates of developmental stage from the transcriptome agree well with those using the moisturecontent of the grain, if the values for the ce samples  <cit>  are compared with those from the developmental series . this suggests that water status acts as a major signal for control of wheat caryopsis development .

using this transcriptome analysis, it is also possible to identify genes which are affected by the environmental treatments independently of general developmental effects. the expression values from the ce samples at  <dig> daa were corrected to the closest developmental stage from table  <dig>  probesets were selected which were more than two-fold changed in this corrected expression for both drought-treated or both heat-treated samples relative to corresponding samples lacking these treatments . transcripts specifically up-regulated due to drought seem to have a role in non-starch polysaccharide hydrolysis, whereas those down-regulated include a lt <dig>  transcript; homologues of lt <dig>  have been shown to be highly responsive to environmentalconditions, being induced by low temperature . the most highly up-regulated transcript under heat is rubisco activase whichhas been shown to be inducible by heat and is consistent with its role in maintaining rubisco integrity at high temperature  <cit> . surprisingly, a transcript for a heat shock protein appeared to be down-regulated in the heat-treated samples. altenbach and kothari  <cit>  also identified a few transcripts as affected by temperature, independently of developmental effects, but these effects were not seen here, probably because of the more moderate high temperature treatment . overall, acceleration of development explained the great majority of the changesobserved at  <dig> daa; 93% being within a factor of  <dig>  of the predicted value.

expression of transcription factors
the wheat affymetrix genechip® contains about  <dig>  probesets for potential transcription factors . relatively few tfs have been characterised in cereals and even fewer of their target genes and/or biological roles determined. available evidence, however, suggests that tfs and their targets display a many-to-many relationship: thus, multiple tfs bind to a promoter while individual tfs control multiple genes. transcription is either controlled through the requirement for a set of factors to be present in sufficiently high numbers in the right cells at the right time, or via tf modification to alter their binding to dna or each other. the first model predicts the differential expression of factors together with the genes they control; the second does not. the expression of around a half of the total tfs interrogated was constant during grain development while the remainder were distributed between the expression profiles groups outlined. we selected nine tfs for detailed analysis, using qrt-pcr to confirm the changes in expression levels determined using the genechip® arrays ,

the relative expression levels determined by qrt-pcr showed excellent agreement with those determined using arrays, with correlation coefficients ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in five out of the nine cases, while the other four varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> . this degree of agreement is very close to that observed for other genes by  <cit> .

the expression profiles of the tfs selected showed three distinct patterns, associated with gene expression predicted to be in the endosperm, embryo or pericarp .

endosperm-like expression
four of the tfs  displayed an endosperm expression pattern typical of 2_ <dig>  3_ <dig>  3_ <dig> . the heat and heat & drought treatments precipitated the decline of the transcripts presumably in line with accelerated maturation of the endosperm.

taspa and tapbf
many prolamin storage protein genes  subunits) contain the cis-element known asthe endosperm box in their promoters. this bipartite element is composed ofthe gcn <dig> box to which the bzip tfs taspa , and blz <dig>  bind and the prolamin box to which the dof tfs wpbf and bpbf bind  <cit> . previous northern analysis suggested that taspa and tapbf were endosperm-specific with transcript levels peaking around 15– <dig> daa. our data is in good agreement with this as their expression parallels the rise in transcripts for lmw subunit and α-gliadins genes  which is consistent with a role in prolamin gene expression. additional targets are likely to fall into the same grain filling expression profile, such as the trypsin inhibitor bti-cme genes , known targets of bpbf and biz <dig>  <cit> . however, not all prolamin genes have an endosperm box  <cit> . the high molecular weight  subunit genes, for example, presumably rely on other tfs potentially with similar profiles to taspa and tapbf:  <dig> other putative tfs from  <dig> families are represented in the predominantly endosperm 3_ <dig> cluster.

tagamyb
the r2r <dig> class barley hvgamyb tf, initially isolated based on its ability to bind to ga responsive α-amylase promoters expressed in the aleurone during germination also binds to the aaca elements of the b hordein  and bti-cme  promoters, and interacts with bpbf  <cit> . their northern data showed moderate levels of hvgamyb in the endosperm from  <dig> to  <dig> daa, while in situs at  <dig> daa indicated expression tobe mainly in the aleurone layer and embryo. tagamyb has a pattern of expression , typical of group 2_ <dig>  which would be consistent with roles in endosperm grain filling and in the embryo. α-amylase genes are not normally expressed in late grain development but in some genotypes and under specific environmental conditions pre-harvest sprouting or premature amylase production can occur  <cit> . high levels of tagamyb late in grain development may contribute to this phenomenon.

tanac family
the tf encoded by ta. <dig>  has homology to the nac class of tfs . this large plant-specific tf family  contain a nam dna domain that binds to the core sequence cacg. their members regulate developmental processes, as well as defence and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . although still consistent with endosperm expression, transcripts corresponding to ta. <dig> .s <dig> peaked later in grain development compared to the expression of tapbf <dig> and taspa.

several other nac tfs were also included in the array . although their expression pattern was not verified by q-rtpcr, those represented by probe sets ta. <dig> .s <dig>  taaffx. <dig> .s <dig> and ta. <dig> .s <dig> showed very similar expression patterns to ta. <dig> .s <dig> and their encoded proteins sharea very high degree of sequence similarity with each other and to several barley endosperm expressed nac genes  <cit> . phyologenetic analysis  of the nac related sequences from the tigr gene indices and plntfdb database, placed the wheat and barley genes in a small subcladeof the nam group  <cit>  together with two tfs from rice and the maize nrp <dig> and zmnac <dig> genes. consistent with our data, expression of the maize genes is confined to starchy-endosperm cells  <cit> , while mpss data for the two rice genes suggests their expression is confined to the developing grain. no functions have been ascribed to these proteins; however, their tissue specificity and the fact that the maize nrp <dig> gene is a maternally controlled imprinted gene, may indicate an important role in endosperm development.

interestingly, the gene represented by probe set ta. <dig> .a <dig>  had a distinctly different expression pattern  although was still highly homologous to the others , suggesting either this protein has a different function, or performs the same function in other tissues of the developing grain.

embryo-like expression
three of the other tfs chosen for further analysis showed an embryo like expression pattern similar to group 1_ <dig> and 2_ <dig> transcripts.

taembp and tavp1
taembp a bzip tf  <cit>  and zmvp <dig> an abi3b <dig> class tf  <cit>  are known to be associated with maturation of the embryo and aleurone layer and the expression profiles of taembp and tavp <dig> both showed an embryo like pattern . known targets of both factors include genes encoding the em  protein that are involved in protecting cells against tissue damage during seed desiccation  <cit> . expression of the multiple em genes is induced by abscisic acid  and involves both embp and vp <dig>  binding to the g-box in the abscisic acid response element . expression of the em genes present in the array  was typical of group 1_ <dig> transcripts, thus consistent with taembp and tavp <dig>  being responsible for their expression.

maize vp <dig> is also known to be involved in expression of the aleurone specific myb tf gene c <dig> and in the repression of α-amylase gene expression in the aleurone layer late in grain development  <cit> . accordingly, zmvp <dig> was found to be highly expressed in both developing embryos and the aleurone layer. since em mrna accumulates to high levels in wheat aleurone cells  it is likely that this is also true in wheat which would mean group 1_ <dig> contains transcripts expressed in both embryo and aleurone.

tamyb3
hvmyb <dig> a myb-related  tf was reported to be capable of interacting with bpbf and blz <dig> and to bind to the tatc elements in the promotersof the itr- <dig> , and α-amylase amy <dig>  genes  <cit> . the expression profile of the wheat tamyb <dig>  orthologue , however, does not reflect those of bti-cme , or the lmw subunit genes , nor tagamyb , which potentially regulates the same spectrum of genes, and is more consistent with a primary role in the embryo for this factor. in fact hvmyb <dig> was also shown to be expressed in barley embryos in addition to the developing endosperm, but it ispossible that the roles of hvmyb <dig> and tamyb <dig> may have diverged.

pericarp-like expression
two previously uncharacterised tfs showed a typical pericarp like expression similar to transcripts in groups 2_ <dig> and 3_ <dig> .

tayab2
the protein corresponding to probe set ta <dig> .s <dig>  has homologyto the class of tfs known as c2c2-yabby, all of which contain a zinc-fingerdna binding domain and a hlh yabby domain. this small plant-specific tf family contains seven to eight members in rice and six in arabidopsis, where they have been shown to be involved in establishing abaxial-adaxial polarityin lateral organs and in restricting meristem initiation and growth  <cit> . characterisation of the genes in monocots is less advanced, but mutational and expression analysis suggest that their functions have diverged between monocots and dicots, with the monocot tfs lacking a central role in specifying abaxial-adaxial cell fate  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis  shows that apart from ta <dig> .s <dig> the wheat affymetrix chip also has probesets for wheat homologues to all of the rice genes  <cit>  apart from osyab <dig> and osyab <dig>  the wheat ta yab <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes are not expressed in developing grain , while tayab <dig> , tadl , and tayab <dig>  all showed broadly similar pericarp like patterns of expression ; which is consistent with the pericarp expression reported for hvdl and early grain development forosyab <dig>   <dig> and osdl  <cit> . our data are consistent with a role for all these yabby proteins in pericarp development in wheat.

taarf
probeset ta. <dig> .a <dig> , shows homology to the auxin response factor  family of tfs that bind specifically to tgtctc-containing auxin response elements . this relatively small tf family  play a pivotal role in auxin-regulated gene expression of primary response genes  <cit> . the wheat gene sequence is most closely related to the rice osarf <dig> and the arabidopsis atarf <dig> and  <dig> genes  that are highly expressed in most tissues  <cit> . the function of these arfs is unknown but the wheat gene expression profile would be consistent with an auxin-mediated role in pericarp development. a second arf represented by the probe set ta <dig> .s <dig> was also highly expressed in developing grain although in a pattern consistent with roles in both the pericarp and endosperm , this gene is most closely related to osarf <dig> of rice and at arf <dig> of arabidopsis. mutants in atarf <dig> result in pleiotropic effects related to its repression of cell division. for example, knockouts of atarf <dig> lead to extra cell divisions in the integument, which in turn result in the production of larger seeds  <cit> . it would be of interest to determine if ta <dig> .s <dig> has a similar role in the pericarp and endosperm of wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome of developing wheat caryopses shows massive changes in transcript abundance which can be related to key processes driving development. the data presented here represent a resource which can be exploited by those studying transcriptomics in wheat grain to place their results in a developmental context, exemplified by analysis of the effects of heat and drought treatments. we have also shown that the time course data can be interpreted to provide evidence on the tissue specificity and putative function of transcription factors without the need to isolate individual tissues fromthe grain. it is likely that many future applied studies on wheat will also involve whole-grain transcriptomics on elite cultivars  so our data are suited to help interpret these. the value of this dataset will increase as knowledge of the function and spatial distribution of the transcripts represented on the affymetrix wheat array improves. all the data has been submitted in miame-compliant form to the arrayexpress database .
