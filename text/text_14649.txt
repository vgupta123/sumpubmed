BACKGROUND
src-homology region- <dig>  domains are small protein modules mediating transient protein-protein interactions relative to a large number of cellular processes, many of them in connection with disease  <cit> . sh <dig> domains recognize proline-rich sequences through a highly-conserved mode of interaction. sh3-peptide interactions have been found to be highly promiscuous and relatively weak, with binding affinities ranging between  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm  <cit> . the binding site of sh <dig> domains consists of a hydrophobic surface with three shallow pockets defined by the side chains of preserved aromatic residues. these pockets are flanked by the n-src and rt loops, which play an important role in both the affinity and the specificity of binding  <cit> . a prominent feature of this type of interaction is the polyproline ii  helical conformation for several residues of the peptide in the complexes, favouring the presence of proline residues in the sequences recognized by sh <dig> domains. there are however certain sequence positions in the ligand where proline is most frequently found, giving rise to consensus sequences for the sh <dig> ligands around a core sequence ΦpxΦp  <cit> , being Φ a hydrophobic residue and x any residue. two of the three hydrophobic pockets of the sh <dig> binding site are occupied by the side chains of each of the Φp dipeptides of the core sequence. additionally, the side chains of one each tryptophan and tyrosine residues donate a hydrogen bond to carbonyl groups of the peptide ligand. the third pocket, known as 'compass' or 'specificity' pocket, establishes additional interactions with less conserved residues of the ligand, conferring additional specificity to the binding and dictating the orientation of the ligand peptide chain along the binding site. this gives rise to class- <dig> or class- <dig> binding modes .

sh <dig> domains have become very important targets for drug design due to their involvement in a variety of diseases  <cit> . notwithstanding the increasing amount of structural and functional information available about the recognition of proline-rich sequences by sh <dig> domains, the structural-thermodynamic determinants of binding affinity and specificity in these interactions are not fully understood. in particular, we do not understand well enough how changing a particular interaction at the binding interface modifies the binding gibbs energy. this has limited the success in the design of high-affinity ligands for these small domains, even though some promising results have been obtained by rational design strategies  <cit>  or by the use of libraries of n-substituted peptides  <cit> .

one of the reasons for the relatively slow progress in understanding the determinants of sh3-peptide binding affinity and specificity is the difficulty in linking the structural information with a quantitative accounting of the energetics of these interactions  <cit> . in fact, the experimental thermodynamic magnitudes are often confusing. isothermal titration calorimetry  studies with several sh <dig> domains and their ligands have always yielded strongly negative enthalpy changes of binding, partially compensated by negative entropy changes  <cit> . these results were unexpected as the binding interface is primarily hydrophobic. several recent studies have proposed various possible contributions to the unusual thermodynamic features of this interaction: i.e., the reduction in the conformational motions of the protein  <cit> , the folding of the peptide into the binding-competent ppii conformation  <cit>  or the establishment of hydrogen-bond networks mediated by water molecules buried at the binding interface  <cit> . the relative importance of these effects in the global thermodynamic magnitudes of binding remains, however, obscure. an approach to discern between the contributions to the binding energetics coming from the ligand characteristics and those of the protein is to analyse the structural and thermodynamic determinants of binding of the same ligand to different sh <dig> domains.

here we present the solution structure of the r21a mutant of the α-spectrin sh <dig> domain , both in its free form and bound to the decapeptide apsysppppp . we also show a complete thermodynamic characterization of the sh3-p <dig> interaction by calorimetric methods, together with an analysis of its effect upon the conformational dynamics of the sh <dig> domain using amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange . the p <dig> peptide was initially designed as a high-affinity and high-specificity ligand for the abl-sh <dig> domain  <cit>  and the crystal structure of the complex was subsequently determined  <cit> . the spc-sh <dig> domain also binds p <dig>  although with a 100-times lower affinity  <cit> . the r21a mutation in the spc-sh <dig> domain, near the tip of the rt-loop, produces a  <dig> to 4-fold increase in the affinity for p <dig>  rendering this mutant more appropriate for thermodynamic analysis and structural resolution of the complex. the affinity enhancement is properly rationalized on the light of the three-dimensional structure of the complex. we also present a detailed comparison of the structures of the complexes between p <dig> and each of abl-sh <dig> and r21a spc-sh <dig>  in conjunction with the thermodynamic magnitudes of binding, providing an interpretation of the differences observed on the basis of empirical methods for the prediction of binding energetics based on solvent-accessible surface area calculations. the results give insight into the determinants of binding of proline-rich peptides to these small domains and suggest an important role of water molecules buried at the binding interface in eliciting high affinity and specificity for these domains.

RESULTS
the thermodynamics of binding of p <dig> to the r21a spc-sh <dig> mutant domain
the binding between the p <dig> decapeptide and the r21a spc-sh <dig> mutant domain was studied by a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry  and differential scanning calorimetry  experiments. itc experiments were performed at 25°c at both ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , using several buffers at a concentration of  <dig> mm. similar itc experiments were made with the wt spc-sh <dig> domain for comparison. figure 1a shows an example of a calorimetric titration of r21a spc-sh <dig> with p <dig> at ph  <dig>  and 25°c. the contribution of protonation/deprotonation processes to the binding enthalpy change, was estimated using three buffers differing in their ionization heats . table  <dig> summarizes the results of the itc experiments.

both spc-sh <dig> variants bind the p <dig> ligand, although with low to moderate affinity. the affinities are much lower than that of the abl-sh <dig> domain for p <dig> under similar conditions, which is in the range of  <dig> ×  <dig> –  <dig> ×  <dig> m- <dig>  <cit> . in all cases the binding is driven by a large and favourable enthalpy change, partially compensated by an unfavourable entropy change. a similar thermodynamic signature is usually observed for the binding of proline-rich peptides to other sh <dig> domains  <cit> . the very small variation of the binding enthalpies with the ionization enthalpy of the buffers, indicates an insignificant proton exchange with the buffer upon binding, similarly to abl-sh <dig>  <cit> . this is also supported by the small dependence of the binding enthalpy with ph for both protein variants.

at 25°c the affinity of the r21a spc-sh <dig> mutant for p <dig> is about  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than that of the wt, and the magnitude of the enthalpy change increases significantly, indicating an increment in the number and/or strength of interactions between the domain and the ligand accompanying the replacement of the arginine side chain by alanine. concomitantly, there is a decrease in the entropy change of binding, which results in a net gibbs energy gain of about - <dig> kj mol- <dig>  at both ph values upon mutation. the increase in binding affinity cannot be related to any stability change induced by the r21a mutation, since both protein variants have almost identical stabilities as reported elsewhere  <cit> .

the structure of the free and bound form of r21a spc-sh3
except for the labile side-chain hydrogen atoms, all proton resonances in the free as well as in the bound form were assigned from 2d tocsy and 2d noesy 1h-nmr spectra. these full assignments and the high quality of the  <dig> mhz spectra were crucial for the success of the automatic structure determination of both forms using a combined candid and aria protocol . figure  <dig> shows a stereo representation of the superposition of the free on the bound r21a spc-sh <dig> ensembles of structures. both ensembles fulfil very well the experimental data and are of extremely high quality, as can be seen from the high percentage of the residues in the favoured region of the ramachandran plot . the structure of the free and bound forms are closely similar, with a pairwise rmsd of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for the backbone n,ca,c' atoms and all heavy atoms of residues 7– <dig>  respectively. they are both also very similar to the x-ray wt structure  with a backbone pair wise rmsd of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for residues 7– <dig> of the free and the bound form, respectively. figure  <dig> highlights the close similarity between the three structures, as the aromatic residues present in spc-sh <dig> are coordinated in a very comparable way. all these residues except trp <dig> are important for binding polyproline sequences. moreover, the unfavorable torsion angles for residue  <dig> found in the wt x-ray structure are also present in all structures of both nmr ensembles.

the structure of the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> complex
the structure of the complex between r21a spc-sh <dig> with the p <dig> peptide was obtained by a two-step docking protocol using the haddock software  <cit> . ambiguous interaction restraints were obtained by titrating a solution of r21a spc-sh <dig> with p <dig> and subsequent recording of 2d-tocsy spectra . the most significant changes in the chemical shift of the tocsy cross-peaks can be observed at the rt loop , the beginning of the β-iii strand , the 310-helix  and the f <dig> residue, as it was expected since they constitute the main structural elements involved in the binding to p <dig> in abl-sh <dig>  figure 5b shows all protons  that shift more than  <dig>  ppm in a model of the complex that was created by superimposing spc-sh <dig> on the x-ray structure of the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex . ambiguous interaction restraints  were defined between each of these protons and all atoms of the p <dig> ligand and used as input in the first haddock run. an ensemble of  <dig> lowest interaction energy water-refined complex structures was then used to assign and identify noes within p <dig> and between the protein and ligand. the  <dig> airs and  <dig> intermolecular noes are collected in table  <dig> of the supplementary material . all airs, intra- and intermolecular noes were used as input in a second haddock run . the fifty lowest interaction energy structures were refined in shell of water. all  <dig> structures fall within  <dig> cluster using a cutt-off of  <dig>  Å. the  <dig> water-refined lowest interaction energy structures were used for further analysis. the ensemble of these  <dig> nmr structures fulfils all experimental data; no violations greater than  <dig>  Å of the noe-derived or interaction restraints were found . figure  <dig> shows a stereo representation of the final r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> ensemble of structures derived from the haddock protocol superimposed on the x-ray structure of the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex.

the effect of p <dig> binding upon conformational flexibility of r21a spc-sh3
hx rates, khx, have been measured at ph*  <dig>  and  <dig> °c for the r21a spc-sh <dig> domain, both in the free form and in the presence of the p <dig> peptide at a saturation degree of 96%. reliable data  could be extracted for  <dig> residues in the free form and  <dig> residues in the bound form of the possible  <dig>  from these experimental data the population of states of the protein having each residue in a disordered, hx-competent conformation was calculated as described in methods, for both the free and p41-bound forms of r21a spc-sh <dig>  it is evident from figure  <dig> that the free domain has a considerable conformational flexibility, particularly high at the loops, the chain ends and the edges of secondary structure elements. the binding of p <dig> results in a strong stabilisation for many residues throughout the whole protein sequence, not only limited to those residues involved directly in the binding interface. conformational flexibility is dramatically reduced at the central regions of the secondary structure elements of the domain, i.e., the five β-strands, the short  <dig> helix, and a short stretch of β-sheet formed by residues  <dig> and  <dig> in the long rt-loop. residues at more flexible regions in the free form also show great stabilising effects, in particular at the rt- and n-src loops, likely due to their involvement in p <dig> binding. similar effects were observed for the binding of proline-rich peptides to other sh <dig> domains  <cit> .

discussion
the combined use of candid, aria and haddock has resulted in high quality structures of the r21a mutant of the α-spectrin sh <dig> domain when it is free in solution and bound to the proline-rich ligand p <dig>  we found that candid was more efficient than aria in the automatic assignment of noes, while the resulting structures showed worse structural statistics. this prompted us to use candid for the automatic assignment and aria to calculate and refine the structures of r21a spc-sh <dig> in the free and bound form. this approach resulted in high-quality structures for both forms  that are closely similar and highly comparable to the wt x-ray structure. the success of the approach can be attributed to the use of a single high-quality  <dig> mhz 2d noesy spectrum and to the complete set of assignments of all proton frequencies in both cases.

comparison between the r21a mutant and wt spc-sh3: the role of residue  <dig> in binding affinity
we have shown by the use of itc, that the binding affinity of α-spectrin sh <dig> for p <dig> increases about 3- to 4-fold upon replacement of the arginine at position  <dig> for an alanine residue. the mutation, however, does not have any important effect upon the global or local stability of the domain as indicated by dsc and hx measurements  <cit> . having both wt and mutant structures, we can now rationalize the difference in affinity for p <dig>  the longer side chain at position  <dig> in the wt structure crosses the binding interface of sh <dig> , thus hindering tight binding of the p <dig> ligand to wt α-spectrin sh <dig>  although the corresponding residue in abl-sh <dig> is comparable in side-chain length , the local difference in the backbone structure of the rt loop of abl-sh <dig> makes this side chain pointing away from the binding cleft, enabling tight binding in this case.

comparison between the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> and abl-sh3:p <dig> complexes: rationalizing the differences in binding affinity
the interaction between r21a spc-sh <dig> and p <dig> buries  <dig> ±  <dig> Å <dig> of non-polar area and  <dig> ±  <dig> Å <dig> of polar area, very similar to the values of the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex , in good agreement with the structural details of both complexes.

one of the simplest and most frequently used methods to derive thermodynamic parameters of binding from experimental structural information is based upon applying semi empirical coefficients to the changes in polar and apolar solvent-accessible surface areas  during binding  <cit> . we have used the method of baker and murphy  <cit>  assuming a rigid-body binding model  and ignoring initially the possible participation of buried water molecules in the complexes. with these assumptions, the predictions for the binding heat capacity changes  are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental values . conversely, the predicted binding enthalpies and entropies are completely flawed: both the calculated enthalpic and entropic terms of the binding energy are positive, consistent with a predominantly hydrophobic interaction. more importantly, the predicted differences in the thermodynamic magnitudes between both complexes do not reflect the large experimental differences in binding enthalpy, entropy and gibbs energy, which, therefore, cannot be justified on the basis of only the sh3:p <dig> interaction.

several important contributions to the binding energetics have been neglected in these calculations, such as the folding of the p <dig> peptide  <cit> , the change in the conformational dynamics of the protein induced by ligand binding  <cit> , and the role of long-lived, bound water molecules in mediating binding interactions  <cit> . the first of these contributions should not have an influence here since the two complexes share the same ligand in a very similar bound conformation.

on the other hand, the results of the hx analysis show that binding of p <dig> strongly reduces conformational flexibility of the r21a spc-sh <dig> domain. it is thus plausible that this effect has an important impact on the thermodynamic magnitudes of binding, as it has been discussed elsewhere  <cit> . in fact, both of the enthalpies and the entropies of the spc-sh <dig> conformational fluctuations under native conditions have been found elsewhere to be large, positive and mutually compensating  <cit> . therefore, a decrease in the probability of occurrence of these fluctuations on p <dig> binding may well account for a significant portion of the negative enthalpy and entropy of binding as observed experimentally. it is also possible that the reductions in conformational dynamics of spc-sh <dig> and abl-sh <dig> on p <dig> binding are dissimilar enough to account for part of the observed differences in binding thermodynamics. to confirm such possible contributions would imply, however, an extensive comparative study of the effect of ligand binding to not only spc-sh <dig> but to abl-sh <dig> as well, which will be the scope of future work.

recent calorimetric studies have proposed that five water molecules, found buried into the binding interface in the crystal structure of the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex, may be responsible for the highly favorable binding enthalpy, partially compensated by a large binding entropy  <cit> . we modeled these water molecules into the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> structure by direct superposition of the two complexes . two of these five waters  appear similarly buried in the two complex interfaces, while the other three seem no longer buried in the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> complex, suggesting that they are likely not mediating this interaction. to have a rough estimate of the differential energetic impact of these buried water molecules upon the two complexes, we have recalculated the changes in asa on binding considering the five buried water molecules as part of the abl-sh3:p <dig> complex and only two buried water molecules as part of the r21a spc-sh3:p <dig> complex . the predicted differences in binding energetics between abl-sh <dig> and spc-sh <dig> are now in a better qualitative agreement with the experimental ones providing a plausible explanation for the much higher binding affinity of abl-sh <dig> for p <dig>  this supports an important role for buried water molecules in mediating the sh3-peptide interactions, which are specially optimized in the abl-sh <dig> domain resulting in high binding affinity.

CONCLUSIONS
the combined use of modern automatic structure calculation and docking methods have resulted in high quality structures of the r21a mutant of the α-spectrin sh <dig> domain in the absence and presence of proline-rich ligand p <dig>  the high resemblance between the r21a spc-sh <dig> domain structure in its free and in its p41-bound form implies that the binding interface is completely predetermined and no major conformational changes are needed to adapt to the ligand structure upon binding. based on a deep structural and thermodynamic analysis of the r1a spc-sh <dig> in complex with p <dig> in comparison with the complex between another sh <dig> domain, abl-sh <dig>  with higher affinity to the same ligand p <dig>  we underline the importance of taking into account in any effective strategy of rational design of ligands, factors different from the direct protein-ligand interactions, such as the mediation of interactions by water molecules or the existence of cooperative conformational effects induced by binding.
