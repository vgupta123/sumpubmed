BACKGROUND
atlantic salmon are part of the salmonidae family which comprise all salmon, trout, whitefish, grayling, and charr. a tremendous amount of basic biology is already known about salmonids from studies carried out on their physiology, population dynamics, behavioural ecology and phylogenetics  <cit> . salmon also provide an excellent model system in which to study fundamental genetic mechanisms of growth, development, reproduction and response to infection and disease. for example, salmonids serve as prominent models for studies involving environmental toxicology  <cit> , carcinogenesis  <cit> , comparative immunology  <cit> , the molecular genetics and physiology of the stress response  <cit> , olfaction  <cit> , vision  <cit> , osmoregulation  <cit> , growth  <cit>  and gametogenesis  <cit> .

answers to fundamental scientific questions can also be gained from the study of salmonid genomes. the ancestor of all extant salmonids underwent a whole genome duplication and after a series of subsequent genetic events, salmon are now considered to be pseudo-tetraploid. how a genome reorganizes itself to cope with a duplicated genome and the importance of gene duplications for evolution and adaptation are long standing issues that remain unresolved. questions regarding the origins of genomes have direct implication for our understanding of the roles of gene families, duplication and deletion of segments of genomes, and the mutational process in human health and disease. they also provide a foundation for understanding the genome of atlantic salmon to benefit conservation and enhancement of wild stocks, aquaculture and environmental assessments. genomic resources enable us to address fundamental scientific questions concerning the evolution of salmonid genomes, and the expression of genes and proteins in a wide variety of natural and altered environments and conditions.

toward these goals, more than  <dig> cdna libraries have been constructed from a wide variety of tissues and different developmental stages and more than  <dig>  salmonid cdna sequence reads have been combined from a consortium comprising groups from canada ; susan douglas et al. and the institute for marine biosciences, nrc); france ; norway ) and the u.s.a. . these sequences were assembled into over  <dig>  unique contigs. a preliminary microarray of  <dig>  cdnas was constructed and assessed on its' ability to provide new data in the study of cellular and tissue responses to pollutants, diseases and stress, as well as for reproduction and development  <cit> . on the basis of these results, a larger array of  <dig>  genes has been constructed and initial results have shown sensitivity of gene expression patterns to disease challenge, and to small environmental and physiological changes  <cit> .

RESULTS
library construction  and subsequent est sequencing  were designed to generate 3'-end sequences to enable us to distinguish between potential paralogs arising from the recent salmonid genome duplication. we have determined from a weighted average measurement comparing four different directionally-cloned library types  that approximately 9% of inserts are in the reverse orientation and therefore yield 5' sequence with the m <dig> forward primer  <cit> . the grasp 3'-end reads were used as a framework on which to build the contigs from additional data provided by the nrc, inra, usda/ars and the nsvs. part of the evaluation process for selecting genes for the microarray required criteria that would guard against chimeras. simply put, this meant that each gene choice had to be part of a contig with multiple distinct clones covering each region, or that it was sufficiently similar to another sequence across its whole length that it was unlikely to be chimeric. we did select for immune-specific and reproduction-relevant genes for the microarray, but the preponderance of ests on the 16k chip were randomly picked based on est cluster quality and uniqueness and therefore represent a wide variety of different classes of genes.

application of a 16k cdna microarray to different species
to explore the validity of using the 16k microarray with other fish species, the  <dig>  atlantic salmon  and  <dig>  rainbow trout  cdna features were interrogated with labeled liver targets from four members of the order salmoniformes  and one member of the order osmeriformes  . the average percentage binding of as, rt, chinook salmon, lake whitefish  and rainbow smelt liver targets to the 16k chip was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the average percentage of targets bound to as and rt features for each species are also shown .

our study indicates that there are no significant differences in the percent of targets that bound to the 16k microarray for the four salmonids examined . there is a similar hybridization performance for all salmonids. however, rt targets do consistently show higher overall binding to the microarray; the reason for this efficiency is not yet clear.

the hybridization performance of the rainbow smelt targets were roughly one-half those of the salmonid cdnas. of the species contributing targets to our heterologous hybridization experiment, the osmerid targets were the most phylogenetically removed from the salmonid features. indeed, a recent mitogenomic study places the osmeroidei in a separate clade from the salmoniformes  <cit> . these two clades are separated by at least  <dig> my with the salmonidae having undergone at least one genome duplication event since their divergence  <cit> . other factors such as genome gene content  and genome size are likely to be factors affecting the overall degree of hybridization  <cit> .

application of a 16k cdna microarray to different tissues
different tissues and organs exhibit differences in transcriptome complexity, depending on their cellular heterogeneity and differentiated specializations. the mrnas of a typical somatic cell are divided into three classes based on their sequence complexity and diversity  <cit> . the most prevalent class consists of only a few mrna species that comprise the abundant transcripts present in a cell. often these transcripts are dedicated to cellular functions common to all tissues, but they usually represent genes that specify an organs' unique function. the high complexity class of mrnas includes thousands  of different mrna species, each represented by fewer than  <dig> copies per cell  <cit> .

however, it should be noted that some subsets of genes that have been thought to be unique to one organ have been found to be expressed in others. this has been demonstrated for transcripts in the brain-gonad axis, and is probably not exclusive to these organs. for example, mammalian pheromone/odorant receptors and specific piscine hormones and receptors of the brain are also expressed in the gonad  <cit> . to date, the biological functions of these transcripts in the gonad have not been determined, raising intriguing questions regarding multiplicity of functions for complex transcripts, even in diploid vertebrates such as mammals.

to determine the differences in the transcriptome complexity of seven different as tissues and organs, the  <dig>  as and  <dig>  rt cdna features were hybridized with labeled targets from midgut, brain, spleen, muscle, ovary, kidney and testis . the average percentage binding of midgut, brain, spleen, muscle, ovary, kidney and testis targets to the 16k chip was  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in general, about 45% of the salmonid microarray features were not bound by targets from the various as tissues and organs.

application of a 16k cdna microarray to the same tissue from cohorts
to determine the amount of gene expression variability that exists between individuals of a single species, we compared the transcriptomes of livers from three fish with identical histories. we compared the average percent of variation  in expression of liver transcripts between cohorts  <dig> and  <dig> , cohorts  <dig> and  <dig>  and cohorts  <dig> and  <dig> . two separate experiments of six hybridizations each were conducted with each liverpairing having one dye-flip.

examining each individual array in the intraspecies study showed that the overall mean scatter was  <dig> % . when the liverpair arrays and their respective dye-flips were combined and averaged, the overall mean scatter was reduced to  <dig> %. this indicates that systematic unequal dye incorporation exists resulting in high scatter values. this dye bias has been well-documented by other researchers  <cit>  and illustrates the importance of incorporating dye swap pairs when performing microarray hybridizations whenever possible. the overall mean scatter was further reduced to  <dig> % when the analysis included technical dye swap replicates between respective liverpairs . this demonstrates that increasing the number of technical replicates in a microarray experiment is an important factor to consider for reducing random scatter. it is encouraging that the overall scatter between individuals from the same broodstock was quite low. thus technical and biological variability across arrays and individuals can be significantly reduced by the investigator if the appropriate experimental design is employed.

application of a 16k cdna microarray to analyze bac contents
to assess the use of the 16k array as a screening tool to identify the genes present in a salmonid bac, the  <dig>  as and  <dig>  rt features were interrogated with nebulized and labeled fragments from a single bac whose sequence has been determined . analysis of our initial bac hybridizations revealed that a high proportion of transposon-like sequences and long and short interspersed nuclear elements were binding to the array. it is known that many different repeat elements derived from once-mobile transposable segments comprise large portions of the atlantic salmon genome  <cit> . in an effort to improve the specificity of target binding to the microarray for bac hybridization, we employed a cot- <dig> dna protocol to reduce the binding of these repetitive elements . the addition of cot- <dig> dna increased the number of expected genes identified and the number of hits for the expected genes by displacing many of the repeat family and transposon associated elements.

abac 92i <dig> was previously characterized. the assembled bac sequence was blasted against the microarray gene identification list to determine the expected gene number. repetitive elements, transposon-associated sequences and unknown ests were not included in the total. only the top  <dig> hits were examined.

cnumber of identified transposon, transposase and reverse-transcriptase associated sequences.

although cot- <dig> dna did improve the ability to identify genes for the bac we examined, cot- <dig> dna alone is not enough to block the complications that arise from repetitive elements in whole genome hybridizations. in preliminary comparative genomic hybridization studies we have found that even with cot- <dig> dna included in the hybridizations, the repetitive dna segments found in salmonid genomes interfere with the interpretation of the data. most investigators are not interested in these repetitive segments, but rather in the genes that are interspersed between them. moreover, we have found that often these repetitive elements lead to false positives. using other methods, such as including repeat-element amplified products with cot dna, as well as higher stringency washes, might improve binding specificities. we are currently working on various strategies to maximize blocking of this repeat element 'noise'.

CONCLUSIONS
we validate and demonstrate the usefulness of the 16k microarray over a wide range of teleosts, even for transcriptome targets distantly removed from salmonids phylogenetically. we show the potential of the use of the microarray in a variety of experimental settings through hybridization studies that examine the binding of targets derived from different organs and tissues. intraspecific variation in transcriptome expression is evaluated and discussed. finally, bac hybridizations are demonstrated as a rapid and accurate means to identify gene content. we expect that this array will serve as an important resource for genetic, physiological, ecological and many other fields of salmonid study.
