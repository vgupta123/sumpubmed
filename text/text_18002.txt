BACKGROUND
soybean  merr.) is believed to have been domesticated in north-eastern china from its wild relative, glycine soja sieb. & zucc.  <cit> . glycine soja is native throughout china, the adjacent area of russia, korea, japan and taiwan  <cit> . flower color of g. soja is almost exclusively purple; by contrast, 33%  of the soybean accessions in the usda soybean germplasm collections have white flowers . the reason why g. soja almost lacks flower color variants is uncertain  <cit> . a few white-flowered g. soja accessions were reported in a chinese germplasm collection, but these had high 100-seed weight, strongly suggesting recent outcrossing with g. max  <cit> . one white-flowered plant  was found in  <dig> among the progeny of a purple-flowered g. soja accession  that was originally introduced from south korea in  <dig>  <cit> . genetic analysis indicated that the white flower was caused by a recessive allele at the w <dig> locus similar to the white-flowered soybeans  <cit> .

in soybean, six genes  primarily control flower color and two genes  control pubescence color  <cit> . the hydroxylation pattern of b-ring in flavonoids plays an important role in the coloration of seed coats, flower and pubescence of soybeans. the b-ring of flavonoids can be hydroxylated at either the 3' position leading to the production of cyanidin-based pigments, or at both the 3' and 5' positions to produce delphinidin-based pigments. two key enzymes involved in this pathway are flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  and flavonoid 3'5'-hydroxylase  which are both microsomal cytochrome p <dig> dependent monooxygenases that require nadph as a co-factor  <cit> . chromatographic experiments suggested that t and w <dig> loci are responsible for the formation of flavonoids with 3', 4' and 3', 4', 5' b-ring hydroxylation patterns, respectively  <cit> . hence, t and w <dig> are presumed to encode f3'h and f3'5'h, respectively. the f3'h cdna was cloned and characterized from a pair of near-isogenic lines  for the t locus, to7b  and to7g   <cit> . sequence analysis revealed that they differed by a single-base deletion of c in the coding region of to7g. the deletion generated a truncated polypeptide lacking the ggek consensus sequence of f3'h gene and the heme-binding domain, resulting in non-functional protein.

the w <dig> gene has a pleiotropic effect on flower and hypocotyl color: soybean cultivars with purple/white flowers have purple/green hypocotyls. the soybean f3'5'h gene was cloned from nils for w <dig> and confirmed that w <dig> encodes f3'5'h and that the gene of white-flowered nils contained a  <dig> bp insertion in the coding region  <cit> . in addition to the f3'5'h protein, a cytochrome b <dig> is required for full activity of f3'5'h in petunia, and mutation in cytochrome b <dig> results in a reduction in f3'5'h activity and alteration of anthocyanin amount and composition  <cit> .

the flavonoids in flower petals of soybean have been analyzed  <cit> . the primary components of anthocyanin in purple-flowered cultivars were malvidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, petunidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, delphinidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and delphinidin 3-o-glucoside. in addition, eight flavonol glycosides, kaempferol 3-o-gentiobioside, kaempferol 3-o-rutinoside, kaempferol 3-o-glucoside, kaempferol 3-o-glycoside, kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosylgentiobioside, kaempferol 7-o-glucoside, kaempferol 7-o-diglucoside and quercetin 3-o-gentiobioside, and one dihydroflavonol, aromadendrin 3-o-glucoside were identified  <cit> . the sugar component of kaempferol 3-o-glycoside could not be determined. no anthocyanins were detected in clark nils for w <dig> and w <dig>  clark-w <dig> and clark-w <dig>  and only a trace amount was detected in clark-w3w <dig>  the amount of flavonols and dihydroflavonol in nils for w <dig> or w <dig> was largely similar to the nils with purple flowers suggesting that w <dig> and w <dig> affect only anthocyanin biosynthesis. however, the flavonoid composition in flower petals of g. soja has not been analyzed so far.

yasuda discovered b <dig>  a flower color variant of g. soja, at a slope between a paddy field and a ditch in karatsu, saga prefecture  in  <dig>  . its banner petals have a pale pinkish hue and a pronounced light purple pigmentation that originates from the base of the petals and spreads in streaks towards the petal margins. we designated the flower color as light purple. considering its growth habit, small seed size and unique flower color, it is unlikely that the flower color of b <dig> was derived from outcrossing with soybean. to our knowledge, b <dig> is the first example of a flower color variant of g. soja found in nature. the first objective of this study was to determine the genetic basis of purple flower color by crossing experiments. the second objective was to analyze the flavonoids in flower petals of g. soja accessions. the third objective was to clone and characterize a gene responsible for light purple flowers.

methods
genetic analysis
a canadian soybean cultivar harosoy  with purple flowers and gray pubescence and a nil of a us soybean cultivar clark for w <dig> gene, clark-w <dig>  with white flowers and tawny pubescence were crossed with b <dig> having light purple flowers and tawny pubescence in  <dig>  flowers of harosoy and clark-w <dig> were emasculated one day before opening and pollinated with b <dig>  hybridity of the f <dig> plants was ascertained by tawny pubescence color in crossing with harosoy and by spindly growth habit in crossing with clark-w <dig>  seeds of l63- <dig> were provided by the usda soybean germplasm collection. the nil was produced by crossing clark with t <dig> and backcrossing the progeny to clark up to bc <dig>  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> to  <dig> f <dig> seeds derived from the crossing with harosoy and clark-w <dig> were planted in field  on june  <dig> in  <dig> at the national institute of crop science, tsukuba, japan . a bulk of  <dig> seeds each of  <dig> f <dig> families derived from the cross with clark-w <dig> were planted at the same location on june  <dig> in  <dig>  n, p and k were applied at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  g m- <dig>  respectively. flower color was scored in individual f <dig> and f <dig> plants.

analysis of flavonoids
clark, b <dig> and four additional g. soja accessions were used for flavonoid analysis of flower petals. seeds of japanese accessions with purple flowers kokaigawa- <dig> collected in ibaraki prefecture and col/aomori/1983/nasu- <dig> collected in aomori prefecture were obtained from ms. n. mihashi and the nias genebank, respectively. seeds of a south korean g. soja line with purple flowers  and its derivative mutant line with white flowers  were obtained from the usda soybean germplasm collection. seeds of the g. soja lines were planted in vermiculite in a glasshouse on june  <dig> in  <dig>  and transplanted on june  <dig> to pots  filled with  <dig> kg soil . fertilizers were applied at rates similar to the field plantings.

banner petals were collected with forceps at the day of opening. two  <dig> mg samples of banner petals were collected in  <dig> ml of meoh containing  <dig> %  hcl for anthocyanin analysis. two  <dig> mg samples in  <dig> ml of absolute meoh were also collected for the determination of flavonol and dihydroflavonol. high performance liquid chromatography  of anthocyanins, flavonols and dihydroflavonol was performed following previously described protocols  <cit> . the  <dig> ml extracts were filtered through disposable filtration units  and  <dig> μl from each sample was subjected to hplc analysis. the amount of flavonoids was estimated from the pertinent peak area in the hplc chromatogram . the peak area was subjected to analysis of variance using statistica software .

three additional anthocyanins were characterized by direct hplc comparison with authentic specimens, i.e., chrysanthemin  from the autumn leaves of acer species  <cit> , cyanin  from the flowers of dahlia variabilis  desf.  <cit>  and peonin  from the flowers of paeonia albiflora pall. var. hortensis  <cit> .

rna extraction and cdna cloning
total rna was extracted from banner flower petals  of clark, clark-w <dig> and b <dig> using the trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer's instructions. cdna was synthesized by reverse transcription of  <dig> μg of total rna using the superscript iii first-strand synthesis system  and an oligo primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. the full-length cdna was cloned from clark and b <dig>  using a pair of pcr primers  and end-to-end pcr. the pcr mixture contained  <dig>  μg of cdna,  <dig> pmol of each primer,  <dig> pmol of nucleotides and  <dig> unit of extaq in  <dig> × extaq buffer supplied by the manufacturer  in a total volume of  <dig> μl. a  <dig> min denaturation at 94°c was followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> min annealing at 58°c and  <dig> min extension at 72°c. a final  <dig> min extension at 72°c completed the program. the pcr was performed in an applied biosystems  <dig> thermal cycler. the ~ <dig>  kbp pcr product was cloned into pcr  <dig>  vector  and sequenced.

dna sequencing
nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined with the bigdye terminator cycle method using an abi <dig> genetic analyzer . nucleotide sequences and the putative amino acid translations were analyzed with the blast program  <cit> . primers for sequencing the internal regions of f3'5'h genes were 5'-tgtggtggtggaaatgt, 5'-ctatagaaagcacccttcaa, 5'-gcctcatccctcttgttaca and 5'-tttgagacggcgatcccttc.

dcaps and indel analyses
genomic dna of clark, clark-w <dig>  b <dig> and  <dig> f <dig> plants that were used for f <dig> progeny tests was isolated from trifoliolate leaves by ctab  <cit> . a pair of pcr primers  was designed to detect a single-base substitution at nucleotide number  <dig> that is unique to b <dig>  the first primer contains a nucleotide c that is mismatched with its target dna to artificially create a restriction site of ncoi  in clark . the base substitution within the restriction site would result in presence/absence of the restriction site in the amplified product to generate a polymorphism. the pcr mixture contained  <dig> ng of genomic dna,  <dig> pmol of each primer,  <dig> pmol of nucleotides and  <dig> unit of extaq in  <dig> × extaq buffer supplied by the manufacturer  in a total volume of  <dig> μl. after an initial  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c, there were  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> min annealing at 56°c and  <dig> min extension at 72°c. a final  <dig> min extension at 72°c completed the program. the amplified products were digested with ncoi, and the digests were separated on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in  <dig> × tbe buffer . after electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and the dna fragments were visualized under uv light.

a pair of indel pcr primers  was designed to identify the  <dig> bp insertion in f3'5'h gene of soybean lines with w <dig> allele based on the previous report  <cit> . the pcr profile and electrophoresis conditions were identical with the dcaps analysis except that annealing was conducted at 59°c.

semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis
semi-quantitative rt-pcr was conducted by reverse-transcription of  <dig> μg of total rna using the superscript iii first-strand synthesis system and an oligo d primer according to the manufacturer's instruction. to test the transcription level of the f3'5'h gene, pcr reactions were carried out in a volume of  <dig> μl, using  <dig> ng of cdna. the initial  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c was followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> min annealing at 59°c and  <dig> min extension at 72°c. a final  <dig> min extension at 72°c completed the program. the primers were 5'-gacgctgaggatattcaacc and 5'-agaaatctgtgaggtcacga. a soybean actin gene was used as a control. the initial  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c was followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig> sec denaturation at 94°c,  <dig> min annealing at 56°c and  <dig> min extension at 72°c. a final  <dig> min extension at 72°c completed the program. the primers were 5'-ctggggatggtgtcagccacac and 5'-caccgaactttctctcggaaggtg. pcr products were loaded on a  <dig> % agarose gel, stained by ethidium bromide and visualized under uv light.

f <dig> plants produced from a cross between clark-w <dig> and b <dig> had light purple flowers . segregation of the f <dig> plants fitted a  <dig> light purple:  <dig> white ratio except one plant that had purple flowers. the results suggested that the w <dig> locus was responsible for light purple flowers and that light purple flower was dominant to white flower. six f <dig> families derived from f <dig> plants with white flowers produced only plants with white flowers . thirty f <dig> families derived from f <dig> plants with light purple flowers produced twenty-one families segregating for flower color and nine families fixed for light purple flowers; the segregation pattern fit a ratio of  <dig> segregating lines:  <dig> line fixed for light purple flowers . among the twenty-one segregating families, seventeen families segregated into light purple and white flowers, whereas four families each contained one plant with purple flowers in addition to light purple and white flowers. the frequency of plants with light purple and white flowers fitted 3: <dig> ratio in the twenty-one segregating families. the frequency of purple-flowered plants was similar across generations;  <dig> %  in f <dig> and  <dig> %  in f <dig>  progeny of an f <dig> plant with purple flowers segregated at a ratio of  <dig> purple:  <dig> light purple flower . results of the f <dig> progeny tests supported the hypothesis that light purple flower was controlled by a new allele at the w <dig> locus that was dominant to the w <dig> allele. we designated the allele as w1-lp . the gene symbol was approved by the soybean genetics committee. dominance relationship of the locus was w <dig> >w1-lp >w <dig>

flavonoid analysis
the amount of anthocyanins estimated from peak area by hplc analysis is presented in table  <dig>  hplc chromatograms for anthocyanins in pi 424008a and b <dig> are presented in figure  <dig>  in the purple-flowered g. soja lines, four hplc peaks, viz., a <dig> , a <dig> , a <dig>  and a <dig> , were found similar to clark. the amount of malvidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside in purple-flowered g. soja lines was  <dig> to 252% higher than clark. the amounts of the other three anthocyanins were not substantially different from clark.

aa1: malvidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, a2: petunidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, a3: delphinidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, a4: delphinidin 3-o-glucoside, a5: peonidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, a6: cyanidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, a7: cyanidin 3-o-glucoside.

in contrast, flower petals of white-flowered line pi 424008c contained no anthocyanins. further, the flower petals of b <dig> contained about half the amount of a <dig> to a <dig> compared with clark. the hplc chromatogram of b <dig> exhibited three additional anthocyanin peaks, a <dig> to a <dig>  that were not found in soybeans or other g. soja lines . based on the comparison of retention time with authentic specimens, peonin, cyanin and chrysanthemin, a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> were estimated as peonidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, cyanidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and cyanidin 3-o-glucoside, respectively.

eight peaks, f <dig> to f <dig>  corresponding to flavonol glycosides, were detected by hplc analysis: f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> , f <dig> -), f <dig> , f <dig>  and f <dig> . the sugar component of f <dig> could not be determined. though f <dig> has been partially characterized as kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosylgentiobioside  <cit> , our data indicates that it is actually kaempferol 3-o-rhamnopyranosyl-- by 1h and 13c nmr survey. the pertinant 1h and 13c nmr data of f <dig> are as follows:

1h nmr : δ  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  . 13c nmr :  δ  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ;  δ  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ;  δ  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ;  δ  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  .

the amounts of flavonol glycosides estimated by peak areas in hplc analysis are presented in table  <dig>  pi 424008a and pi 424008c contained all eight of the flavonol glycosides found in clark. col/aomori/1983/nasu- <dig> lacked f <dig> and kokaigawa- <dig> lacked f <dig>  b <dig> was devoid of f <dig> and f <dig>  however, the total amount of flavonol glycosides was not significantly different among the clark and g. soja lines included in this report.

af1: kaempferol 3-o-gentiobioside, f2: kaempferol 3-o-rutinoside, f3: kaempferol 3-o-glucoside, f4: kaempferol 3-o-glycoside, f5: kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--, f6: quercetin 3-o-gentiobioside, f7: kaempferol 7-o-glucoside, f8: kaempferol 7-o-diglucoside.

bnot significant at 5% level by analysis of variance

one peak  corresponding to dihydroflavonol  was found by hplc analysis in clark and all of the g. soja lines. the amount of aromadendrin 3-o-glucoside estimated by peak area in hplc analysis is presented in table  <dig>  the g. soja lines had  <dig> to 155% more aromadendrin 3-o-glucoside than clark.

af9: aromadendrin 3-o-glucoside

cdna cloning
four f3'5'h cdna clones each from clark and b <dig> were sequenced from the 5' and 3' ends. the cdna sequence of both lines consisted of  <dig> nucleotides encoding  <dig> amino acids . compared with clark, five nucleotides were substituted in b <dig> at nucleotide positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the coding region. identical base substitutions at nucleotide positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also observed in cultivar chin-ren-woo-dou with purple flowers . substitution at nucleotide positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had no effects on amino acid sequences. in contrast, the base substitution at nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig> changed amino acids from valine to methionine  and from glutamic acid to valine , respectively . the latter amino acid substitution was also found in chin-ren-woo-dou, whereas the former was unique to b <dig> 

dcaps and indel analysis
the pcr reaction for dcaps analysis produced bands with expected size of about  <dig> bp in clark, clark-w <dig> and b <dig> . ncoi digested the bands of clark and clark-w <dig> and shortened the bands by  <dig> bp. in contrast, the band from b <dig> was largely undigested. in addition, a faint band with approximately the same size was also observed among the digested bands in b <dig>  similar results were obtained in dcaps analysis using a different set of pcr primers and a different restriction enzyme  . the pcr reaction for indel analysis produced shorter bands  in clark and b <dig>  and a longer band in clark-w <dig>  due to the  <dig> bp insertion . in addition, a faint band was also observed in clark-w <dig> that was approximately the same size as the shorter bands in clark and b <dig> 

in dcaps analysis of the f <dig> population, plants with w1w <dig> genotype  had only shorter bands, whereas plants with w1-lpw1-lp genotype  had longer bands with faint bands similar to b <dig> . heterozygous plants with the w1-lpw <dig> genotype  had both bands at similar band intensity. in indel analysis, plants with w1-lpw1-lp genotype had only shorter bands, whereas plants with w1w <dig> genotype had longer bands and faint shorter bands. heterozygous plants with w1-lpw <dig> genotype had both bands at similar band intensity. thus, dcaps and indel markers co-segregated in plants with white and light purple flowers. in contrast, the f <dig> plant with purple flowers had the two bands with similar intensities in dcaps analysis and only a shorter band in indel analysis.

semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis
results of semi-quantitative rt-pcr suggested that the transcript level of the f3'5'h gene was not substantially different among lines .

discussion
flower color of g. soja is almost exclusively purple, whereas about 30% of soybean cultivars have white flowers. the reason why g. soja almost lacks flower color variants is uncertain  <cit> . in  <dig>  researchers found a white-flowered variant of pi 424008a, a usda accession of g. soja with purple flowers that was originally introduced from south korea in  <dig>  <cit> . the mutation may have occurred during propagation at usda. to our knowledge, b <dig> is the first example of flower color variant found in the natural habitat.

genetic analysis suggested that light purple flower is controlled by a new allele at the w <dig> locus, w1-lp. dominance relationship of the locus was w <dig> >w1-lp >w <dig>  interestingly, one f <dig> plant and four f <dig> plants with purple flowers were generated in the cross with clark-w <dig>  considering the fact that purple-flowered plants were produced from heterozygous plants  in both f <dig> and f <dig> generations and that frequency of purple-flowered plants was similar  across generations, the purple flower color may have been produced by a crossover in the w <dig> gene instead of seed contamination or out-crossing. the purple-flowered f <dig> plant produced f <dig> plants with purple and light purple flowers at a 3: <dig> ratio; this suggests that the region including the  <dig> bp insertion was eliminated from the genome. the dcaps and indel analyses indicated that the base substitution was heterozygous but the indel region was homozygous without the  <dig> bp insertion in the purple-flowered f <dig> plant. the results further supported elimination of the insertion that is responsible for gene dysfunction from the plant by intragenic recombination. it remains to be investigated whether the existence of tandem repeats derived from the insertion is responsible for the high frequency of intragenic recombination.

sequence analysis of f3'5'h cdna from clark and b <dig> indicated that two amino acids  were substituted. the former substitution has not been observed in soybean cultivars examined to date. it may be responsible for light purple flower and unique anthocyanin composition. however, no catalytic domains have been assigned to the region. the spontaneous mutation leading to flower color change may not have affected amount of f3'5'h gene transcripts, based on the results from semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses.

flavonoids in flower petals of g. soja with purple flowers were generally similar to those of soybean cultivars with purple flowers. flower petals of pi 424008c with white flowers had no anthocyanin but contained comparable amounts of flavonol glycosides and dihydroflavonols. it is consistent with the result from clark-w <dig>  a soybean nil with white flowers, whose flower petals contained no anthocyanin although it had levels of flavonol glycosides and dihydroflavonol similar to clark  <cit> . the present results confirmed that w <dig> solely controls anthocyanin biosynthesis in g. soja.

purple flowers of soybean and g. soja contain four major anthocyanins with 3'4'5'-substituted form, malvidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, petunidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, delphinidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and delphinidin 3-o-glucoside. in contrast, flower petals of b <dig> contained lower amounts of the four major anthocyanins. in addition, they contained small amounts of the 5'-unsubstituted versions of the above anthocyanins, peonidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside, cyanidin  <dig> -di-o-glucoside and cyanidin 3-o-glucoside. it appears that f3'5'h activity was reduced and f3'h activity was increased in flower petals of b <dig>  flower petals of soybean and g. soja contain large amounts of kaempferols and very small amounts of quercetins  <cit> , suggesting that f3'h activity may be very low. further, alleles at the t locus encoding f3'h did not affect 3'-hydroxylation of flavonols in flower petals  <cit> . therefore, it is unlikely that the f3'h gene might be responsible for the anthocyanin alteration. alternatively, mutation in the f3'5'h gene possibly led to a reduction in f3'5'h activity and an increase in f3'h activity. in petunia, a cytochrome b <dig> is required for full activity of f3'5'h. a mutation in cytochrome b <dig> reduced 3'4'5'-substituted anthocyanins and increased 3'4'-substituted anthocyanins  <cit> . it is possible that the amino acid substitution might directly affect the amount and composition of anthocyanins or interact with cytochrome b <dig>  functional analysis using yeast recombinant assays may be necessary to identify the amino acid substitution that led to light purple flower and unique anthocyanin composition, to investigate the association with cytochrome b <dig>  and to verify whether the amino acid substitution generated f3'h activity. transformation experiments using a soybean line with w <dig> allele may be necessary to verify the function of the f3'5'h gene from b <dig>  b <dig> may be the first example of a flower color variant of g. soja found in the natural habitat. it may be a useful tool for studies of the structural and functional properties of f3'5'h genes as well as investigations on the role of flower color in relation to adaptation of g. soja to natural habitats.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first report of a flower color variant of wild soybean g. soja discovered in nature. genetic analysis revealed that light purple flower of the accession b <dig> was controlled by a new allele of w <dig> locus encoding f3'5'h. the new allele was designated as w1-lp. the dominance relationship of the locus was w <dig> >w1-lp >w <dig>  in crossing experiments, purple-flowered plants were generated in the cross between b <dig> and a soybean near-isogenic line with w <dig> allele. f <dig> progeny test, and dcaps and indel analyses suggested that the plants with purple flowers might be due to intragenic recombination. flower petals of b <dig> contained lower amounts of four major anthocyanins common in purple flowers and contained small amounts of the 5'-unsubstituted versions of the above anthocyanins that are absent in soybeans and other g. soja accessions. the results suggested that f3'5'h activity was reduced and flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase activity was increased in the flower petals. the cdna of b <dig> had a unique base substitution resulting in the substitution of valine with methionine. b <dig> may be a useful tool for studies of the structural and functional properties of f3'5'h genes as well as investigations on the role of flower color in relation to adaptation of g. soja to natural habitats.
