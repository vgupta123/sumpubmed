BACKGROUND
sine and line are interspersed nucleotide repeats distributed widely in eukaryotic genomes and occupy a substantial fraction of genome. for example, alu and line <dig> constitute more than 13% and 20% of human genome, respectively  <cit> . they proliferate and replicate themselves through a "copy and paste" mechanism called retroposition involving transcription of their genomic copies followed by reverse transcription of an rna intermediate and resulting cdnas reintegration at a new location into the genome host  <cit> . therefore, sine and line, together with processed pseudogenes, are classified as retrotransposons  <cit> .

many biologists are interested and make great effort to isolate and characterize many retroposons  in various organisms, because it is an indispensable step for addressing the question that how they originate and evolve as well as their functioning and impact on the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. so far, over  <dig> line and nearly  <dig> sine families have been described to date in various eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . moreover, retroposons insertions have proven to be nearly perfect tools for studies of phylogeny and population biology  <cit>  and have been successfully used to resolve phylogenetic relationships among various groups of different taxonomic rank  <cit> . especially so far sines appear to have gained novel functions, acting for example as enhancers or silencers that regulate the expression of preexisting functional genes  <cit> .

currently methods allowing for isolation of sine and line from an unknown genome mostly depend on construction of genomic library and subsequently screening by colony hybridization method using probe specific to particular region of repeated elements. here we propose and describe a new strategy and method used to isolate sines and lines rapidly, in which library construction and screening is completely eliminated. this method is based on hybridization capture of repetitive elements from digested genomic dna in solution using biotinylated oligonucleotide probes which have been pre-attached to streptavidin magnetic beads. subsequently, the captured probe-target dna fragment complex immobilized on the magnetic beads were selected and separated from other non-complementary fragments by magnetic separation, then released and amplified by adapter polymerase chain reaction , finally the pcr products enriched for sine and line were cloned directly into t-vector for sequencing. the whole procedure was completed within only about a week.

lines are approximately 4– <dig> kilobase pair  in length and encode an endonuclease  and a reverse transcriptase , both of which are required for line retrotransposition  <cit> . luan et al. <cit>  proposed the "target-primed reverse transcription"  as the mechanism of line retrotransposition, in which the line en creates a nick in the dna of the host genome and the rt synthesizes cdna in situ using a 3' oh of the dna generated by the nick as a primer. in contrast, sines are relatively short  and non-autonomous retroposons without orfs and so lack the machinery to replicate themselves. it is suggested that sine has recruited the enzymatic machinery for retroposition from the corresponding line through the common "tail"sequence  <cit> , based on the observation that the sequences of many couple of sine and line pairs isolated from many organisms were similar in their 3'end regions  <cit> . this scenario is supported by recent experiments of retrotransposition assay of eel unal <dig> and human line <dig>  unal <dig> can strictly recognize a specific sequence at their 3'tail and mobilize transcript that has the 3' tail of unasine <dig>  <cit> , whereas human line l <dig> can mobilize human sine alu via the poly a tail  at the 3'end  <cit> .

the template switch during tprt was proposed as possible mechanism to explain the formation of chimeric retrotranscripts from a full copy of u <dig> small nuclear rna fused to the 3'terminus of l <dig>  <cit>  and the observation that several sine families have a common 5' half sequence but different 3'tails  <cit> . so maybe the process of how sine acquired the tail of partner line also resulted from the template switch between line and other rna of sine-to-be during tprt  <cit> .

the two closely related species of east asian cyprinids, silver carp  and bighead carp , are believed to have origined recently  <cit> . in the present paper, we successfully use magnetic-bead based system to isolate sine and line in this two species by developing special protocol. the data show that the designated hamosine family was successfully proliferated recently through borrowing the enzymatic machinery of partner lines for retrotransposition in the two genomes. after comparison and detail analysis, we deduced that the hamo sine, smai sine and foki sine that are similar in sequence with each other, were probably generated independently through the switch template between the line <dig> and rna of sine-to-be in respective genome because of an existence of no-similar central region between them. at last, the advantages of this new method and possibility of combining with other protocols are provided.

methods
dna extraction
all species dna was isolated from ethanol-fixed tissues  by incubation with proteinase k followed by phenol/chloroform extraction  <cit> .

preliminary pcr to detect and identify sine
ab-pcr was performed in silver carp and bighead carp as described elsewhere  <cit> . the reaction mixture  contained  <dig> ng of genomic dna and two 12-nucleotide primers  specific to a and b boxes of rna pol iii promoter consensus, respectively. after  <dig> pcr cycles , the amplified ~ <dig> bp dna fragments were isolated by electrophoresis in 5% agarose gel.

inverse pcr was carried out in silver carp as with modification of the method described elsewhere  <cit> . a pair of inverse primers: primer if, primer ir  was designed according to consensus sequence of ab-pcr fragments in silver carp and bighead carp. in brief, haeiii-digested genomic dna fragments were self-circularized in a final concentration of  <dig> ng/μl in a  <dig> μl ligation reaction. inverse pcr  was carried out using the  <dig> ng of above circularized dna as template. the resulting smear fragments were cloned and sequenced.

a pair of primers  corresponding to internal region of sine was used to detect many individual sine copies. the pcr was run in a total volume of  <dig> μl including  <dig> ng dna template with  <dig> cycles of 95°c 40s, 62°c 40s, 72°c 40s. nine clones were selected randomly and sequenced. the clone hmo41_it was used as probe to conduct the next retroposons enrichment strategy.

retroposons enrichment strategy
a. preparation of genomic pool
1) digestion of genomic dna
approximately  <dig> mg of genomic dna was completely digested with haeiii  overnight in a total volume of  <dig> μl. the fragmented dna were subsequently separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose. fragments ranging from 700– <dig> bp were purified from the gel using gel extraction kit  and finally suspended in  <dig> μl of h2o.

2) ligation of adapters
the adapter oligoa  and oligob  were annealed by heating an equal volume of  <dig> μm oligonucleotides for  <dig> min at 95°c,  <dig> min at 65°c,  <dig> min at 45°c,  <dig> min at 25°c, conserved at 4°c. the annealed product is a double-stranded linker of which one end is blunt while the other has a 3' a overhang. additionally, the oligoa was phosphorylated at the 5' base during manufacturing. excess of annealed linkers were ligated to above  <dig> μl of prepared haeiii-fragmented dna  in a  <dig> μl reaction containing  <dig> μm double-stranded linkers, l× ligase buffer,  <dig> units t <dig> dna ligase ,  <dig> μl 50% peg <dig>  the reaction proceeded overnight at 22°c, and then purified through takara column and resuspend in  <dig> μl h2o.

3) pcr enrichment
set up  <dig> pcr reactions with  <dig> μl ddh2o,  <dig>  μl  <dig> mm dntp's,  <dig> μl 10× pcr buffer,  <dig> μl of the  <dig> μm oligo b primer and  <dig>  μl of taq each. then add  <dig> μl of the linker ligation product to each pcr tube. the pcr reaction profile began with a  <dig> min 72°c filling in the nick between each linker and size fraction fragment left by the ligation step, then followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for 45s, 55°c for 45s, 72°c for  <dig> min  <dig> s. a  <dig> min extension step concluded the reaction. then the total  <dig> tube pcr products were purified using 3– <dig> columns column in order not to overload the columns and finally resuspended in  <dig> μl h2o. the reason for doing the 16– <dig> separate pcr reaction at only  <dig> cycles is to maintain the complexity of the linker ligation mixture. otherwise, a lot of identical clones would produce in the end. before being used, the pool must be heat-denatured at 95°c for  <dig> min to make target single-strand dna accessible to probe.

b. preparation of bead-probe complex
1) probe biotinylation
plasmid hmo41_it corresponding to an internal region  of an individual sine was used as template to be biotinylated. in order to label one biotin at one terminus of the dna fragment, we used the primers  with only primer itf biotinylated to perform pcr. at last, the double strand pcr dna with one strand biotinylated was purified in  <dig> μl h2o. before bound to beads, the double strand biotinylated probe must be denatured at 95°c for  <dig> min.

2) probe bound to beads
following the manufacturer's recommendation,  <dig> μl of streptavidin magnetic particles  was collected by removing the storage buffer then washed three times with  <dig> μl binding buffer ten <dig>  for  <dig> min. each time remove the supernatant using magnetic particle concentrator.

above  <dig> μl denatured probe is added to beads of  <dig> μl binding buffer ten <dig>  then incubate for  <dig> min at room temperature to specifically bind the biotinylated strand, then removed supernatant containing non-biotinylated dna strands followed by washing two times for  <dig> min with ten <dig>  then the preparation of the single strand probe-beads complex is accomplished.

c. capture of target sequences
1) hybridization
the beads were washed once with  <dig> μl of hybridization buffer  for  <dig> min, then  <dig> μl of buffer  and  <dig> μl above denatured genomic pool were added to resuspend the beads followed by hybridization in 55°c for  <dig> hours, then non-complementary sequences were removed by washing successively with  <dig> μl ten <dig>  three times for  <dig> min;  <dig> μl buffer  three time for  <dig> min;  <dig> μl ten <dig> for  <dig> min, all these washing are conducted at room temperature, finally target dna were release from the beads by elution at 95°c for  <dig> min in  <dig> μl h2o.

2) adapter pcr
set up separate  <dig> pcr reactions with  <dig> μl ddh2o,  <dig>  μl  <dig> mm dntps,  <dig>  μl 10× pcr buffer,  <dig> μl of the  <dig> μm er1bh1blunt primer and  <dig>  μl of taq polymerase each. then add  <dig> μl of the linker ligation product to each pcr tube. the pcr reaction profile began with a  <dig> min 94°c then followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for 45s, 55°c for 45s, 72°c for  <dig> min  <dig> s. a  <dig> min extension step concluded the reaction. then the total  <dig> tube pcr products were purified for cloning.

3) cloning and positive detection
the enriched pcr products were ligated directly into t- vector  using t <dig> dna ligase, taking advantage of the 3'a overhangs often produced by taq polymerase. colony pcr amplification were performed directly on many single bacterial colony to determine the size of individual inserts, then select at random and sequence many clones in which inserted fragments were longer than  <dig> bp.

quantification of hamo sine copy number in two genomes using quantitative real time-pcr
plasmid hmo41_it corresponding to one individual copy of hamo sine and genomic dna of silver carp and bighead carp were prepared as standard and sample for real-time pcr, respectively. then, concentration of them were measured using spectrophotometer and five-fold serial dilutions of them were prepared respectively as templates to perform real-time pcr in a pcr machine  one time. all real-time pcr reactions was performed with  <dig> cycles at 95°c 40s, 62°c 40s, 72°c 40s including primer itf and itr  and sybr green in a final volume of  <dig> μl. at last, a melting curve analysis was done after the amplification phase. the standard curve and data analysis were carried out in the software mj opticon monitor  <dig> .

characterization of hamo line family
to determine the 5' upstream sequence from a breakpoint at the haeiii site of the hamo line, we employed the method of genomic dna walking in which tail-pcr  was conducted using one arbitrary degenerate prime provided by kit  and special primer designed according to the consensus of haeiii-fragmented lines. the whole pcr processes are conducted according to manufacture's instruction and the last pcr products were cloned and sequenced.

RESULTS
preliminary pcr to detect and identify sine
ab-pcr was amplified with very small amount of genomic dna as a template and two oligonucleotides specific to boxes a and b of the promoter of rna polymerase iii as primers as described elsewhere  <cit> . among many ab-pcr clones, we obtained some high similar sequences in two closely related species, silver carp and bighead carp, respectively . the similar but not identical ab-pcr sequences and intact a box and b box, together with its reasonable sequence similarity to certain trnas  indicated that they may have been amplified from different sine copies of one same sine family in the above two species.

to amplify the regions flanking ab-pcr fragment and test whether the above ab-pcr fragments belong to a part of a certain sines as we expected, a pair of primer: primer ivf and ivr which face in opposite orientations and correspond to consensus sequences of ab-pcr was designed to perform inverse pcr in silver carp . the whole procedure including recovery of origin sequence is shown schematically and described in additional file  <dig>   <dig> of the recovered original sequences of inverse pcr shared a high similar region possessing characteristic features of typical sines, including line2-related region followed by short tandem repeats , but they differed in their flanking regions which indicate they may represent different retroposon locus . these significant evidences implied that the shared region may be sine and provided us a preliminary window to see the full structure of sine.

in order to get the probe specific to the sine for the next new non-library retroposons enrichment method, we designed a pair of primer  corresponding to the internal region of sine to detect many individual sine copies . nine clones selected by random show little sequence divergence indicate that this sine family may be a young family. at last we selected plasmid hmo41_it to be biotinylated as probe for the non-library enrichment strategy.

non-library retroposons enrichment strategy
the non-library retroposons enrichment strategy has been conducted using plasmid hmo41_it corresponding to the internal region of an individual sine copy as probe to directly capture the haeiii-fragmented genomic dna containing the sine sequence in solution. the whole procedure was schemed in figure  <dig> and described in the materials and methods section. the entire isolation procedure can be completed in about a week. every important phase can be monitored by the electrophoresis . at last, captured specific dna fragments were cloned and sequenced and most of them were 700– <dig> bp in length . in this case, the efficiency of the non-library strategy reaches nearly 60% by calculating the ratio of unique positive clones . finally,  <dig> and  <dig> sine loci are determined in silver carp and bighead carp, respectively. simultaneously,  <dig> line elements  were isolated in the final products, because the probe contained an about  <dig> bp tail region shared by sine and line.

identification of young sine family in silver carp and bighead carp
using the above non-library enrichment method, we isolated and characterized a new sine family containing  <dig> and  <dig> members from silver carp and bighead carp, respectively. we designated it hamo sine family for combining hmo  and amo . the consensus sequence of hamo sine is  <dig> bp in length and identical in the two species, which has typical structure of sines: a trnalys-related promoter region at their 5'-end, a unique central family-specific region and an end with line2-derived 3'-terminus preceding the short tandem repeats taaatg .

we cannot find enough diagnostic nucleotides to divide them into subfamily, and only clone  <dig> in silver carp and clone  <dig> in bighead carp shared a common a <dig> insertion in the trna-unrelated region. almost all members in silver carp  and  <dig> out of  <dig> members in bighead carp are flanked by obvious tsd , which are thought to have been produced during retrotransposition. the small sequence divergence among the members of hamo sine and sd show that this sine family seems to be very young and proliferated very recently

the hamo sine 5' end is derived from trna
blastn homology search revealed that the trna-related region of the hamo family was most similar to trnalys in rabbit  <cit>  and showed equal similarity  to trnalys in rat, chicken, mouse, bombyx mori, drosophila melanogaster, respectively. when compared the predicted secondary structure between the trna-derived region of hamo family and rabbit trnalys , we found a feature that they have no homology in the acceptor stem region, which also happened to trnalys-derived smai family  <cit> . however, the significant homology in secondary structures and the numbers of nucleotides in the stem and loop structures suggested that the trnalys species was the most likely candidate for the origin of hamo sines. the obvious conservation of secondary structure in trna-related regions including conserved a and b boxes of the split promoter in hamo sine manifested their functional importance for transcription by polymerase iii.

characterization of partner line family of hamo sine in silver carp and bighead carp
many isolated clones contain a region only matched to 3' tail of hamo sine probe  in the genomes of silver carp and bighead carp when isolating hamo sine. after blast search and alignment of these sequences of clones, we characterize them as 5'haeiii -fragmented and 5' truncated lines, which are homologs of cr1-2_dr in zebrafish. we designated these lines as hamo line, since possibly they encode rtase responsible for retrotransposition of hamo sine through recognition of the common 3'tail conserved in nucleotide sequences and secondary structure .

in order to determine the 5' upstream sequence from a breakpoint at the haeiii site of these lines, we employed the genomic dna walking method to determine many sequences of clones containing 5'-truncated partial line . at last, a consensus sequence of  <dig> bp was deduced, corresponding to partial orf that encode rtase and 3' utr. the predicted partial amino acid sequences encoded by hamo line are 72% identical to that of cr1-2_dr and homologous to that of other line <dig> .

eickbush's group divided all identified lines into  <dig> distinct clades based on an extended sequence alignment of their rt domains  <cit> . recently a novel l <dig> clade is well separated from the cr <dig> clade which is widely distributed in eukaryotic genomes such as vertebrates, echinoderms and insects  <cit> . when hamo line sequence was added into analysis, the phylogenetic tree shows that hamo line was most close to zebrafish cr1-2_dr and constituted a monophyletic group with zebrafish cr1-2_dr, salmon sall <dig> and eel unal <dig> in the l <dig> clade of lines   <cit> . so hamo line are homolog of other l <dig> in various distantly related species that diverged over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

the common tail conserved in primary and secondary structures between hamo sine and hamo line
hamo sine have an approximately 42-bp-long conserved 3'-tail which are almost identical to hamo line and also high similar to other sine family and their paternal line families . there is only one base different in this region between hamo sine and hamo line, suggesting that the conserved 3'tail of hamo sine, which is important for the process of sine retrotransposition, is derived from hamo line in the same genomes of silver carp and bighead carp.

the predicted secondary structures for the 3' tail rna of hamol <dig> and hamo sine forms a secondary structure consisting of a stem and a loop . hamo sine and hamo line share a hairpin region with a ggaua loop which is thought to be a recognition domain for the line rt in unal <dig>  <cit> . so the clear and significant homolog in the 3'-tail between hamo sine and their partner hamo line in primary and secondary structures suggested the hamo sine may borrow the enzymatic machinery of hamo line to proliferate in the same genome through the conserved 3' -tail.

interestingly, short tandem repeats  of variable numbers are observed in the 3'terminus of the tail in both hamo sine and hamo line. most of copies have more than one repetition of the repeat in the tail, which is probably required for the slippage reaction during reverse transcription initiation  <cit> .

estimation of copy numbers of hamo sine
the pair of internal primer: primer itf and primer itr also was used to amplify the hamo sine sequences in genomic dna  and plasmid hmo41_it  in real-time pcr. the results are summarized in additional file  <dig>  we used a serial of diluted genomic dna as tested samples to perform pcr reaction, the final estimations of copy numbers using different concentrated genomic dna template are very close, suggesting that the result of experiment are stable and efficient. at last, average copy numbers of hamo sine in haploid genome of silver carp and bighead carp were estimated to  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively. considering the possibility of mismatch between primers with more divergent hamo sine sequences, so the results of qrt-pcr were minimal estimates of hamo sine copy numbers in the two genomes of silver carp and bighead carp.

discussion
possible structures of hamo sine leading to successful proliferation
the analysis of hamo sine shows that it was very young and proliferated recently to estimated about  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> copy numbers in the haploid genome of silver carp and bighead carp, respectively. in fact, most of the sine loci isolated in this work are species-specific or even not fixed among fish populations when we detected the presence or absence of sine insertions using flanking primers . so hamo sine are highly efficient and successfully proliferated recently in the genome and it maybe owe to its overall structure and internal structure as described below.

firstly, hamo sine keep the overall secondary structure and conserved a and b box in the trna-related region, which ensures the rna iii recognition and transcriptional activity of sines. more importantly, the irregularity of the acceptor stem, as same as smai family, seems to help to escape recognition by trna-processing or rna-modifying enzymes and therefore prevent the rna from being cleaved by the 3'-endonuclease.

secondly, hamo sine share the almost identical 3'tail with hamo line <dig> in primary sequence and secondary structures, which keep them to well utilize the line <dig> enzymatic machinery. their shared same stem-loop region is thought to function as a recognition site for the unal <dig> protein  when this region is transcribed in the rna  <cit> .

moreover, more than one repetition of the short tandem repeat taaatg appeared in most copies, which are revealed to be necessary for successful retrotransposition by mutational analyses in the experiments on other lines of the l <dig> clade and the initiation of reverse transcription of unal <dig> rna in unal <dig>  <cit> .

thirdly, rna structure of the hamo sine is obviously composed of three parts: trna-related region, a family-specific region and line2-related region , that correspond to there parts of secondary structure of its rna: the cloverleaf structure , an unstructured region, the extended stem-loop . this characteristic domain composition is experimentally probed in salmon smai sine rna and seems to have guaranteed successful and continuous amplification of sines in eukaryotic genomes during evolution. from this view, hamo sine may reveal some internal structures of sine that may lead to its successful retrotransposition and proliferation.

three similar but independently derived sine families
when using hamo sine as query to tblastn search, it shows unexpected high similarity to other two sine families in salmon: smai family  and foki family , both are young sine families and have a limited distribution in several specific species belonging to the family salmonidae  <cit> . the two sine families shared a common tail and parasitized sall <dig> in salmon genome  <cit> . after detailed comparison of the consensus sequences of them and their respective partner line families  <cit> , we found that hamo sine is similar in trna-related region  and line-related region  with smai family and foki family. but the existence of a central region  which showed no similarity with each other and are specific to each family make us deduce that they are probably independently generated and evolved in respective evolutionary lineage other than horizontal transfer.

as noted in the introduction section, the template switch during tprt was proposed to explain how sine acquired the tail from corresponding line. in this process, a short cdna would first be generated by copying the 3'terminal line rna sequence, and then rt landing pad will jump to another rna parent of the sine-to-be carrying an internal pol iii promoter  <cit> . so the above-mentioned trnalys derived sine may be born through template switch between respective line and ancestor rna of sine-to-be containing trna-derived region and family-specific region in respective genome of three fishes. coincidently, the three young families are all derived from trnalys or structurally related to trnalys  <cit> . moreover, their parental line  of the above mentioned three sine families are homologous and share a common tail.

in fact, trnalys is the most common source of sines  <cit> . the possible reason is that maybe the ancestor trnalys sine rna had special selective advantage in the above generation process or been preferentially transcripted and retrotransposed after generation among the population of rna of sine -to be.

so this finding suggested that the three similar but distantly related young sine families were generated independently and created by line families within the same lineage of a line phylogeny in the genomes of different hosts.

some aspects about the new retroposons enrichment strategy
magnetic bead-based isolation system has been widely used for the separation of several specific targets like cells, proteins, microsatellites and so on. however, our work is the first report about application of this system for isolation of sines and lines from fish genomes by developing new special protocol. the results demonstrate that this protocol is technically straightforward and permits the isolation of a large number of sine and line from unknown genome in less time consumption and less cost and effort than is required to execute traditional protocol involving rounds of filter hybridization.

in general, if all steps work, the procedure takes only about a week from tissue to several hundred positive clones. additionally, the purchase of the reagents needed for building and screening one library by traditional protocol will supply sufficient reagents for ten or more libraries applied by enrichment protocol. moreover, the protocol can be easily controlled and handled since it requires little specialized equipment platform or technical expertise, may be the pcr and cloning be the most difficult step.

our method, relying on solution hybridization, could greatly facilitate and speed up the interaction between probe and target dna and result in better hybridization efficiencies in comparison with fixed solid supports  <cit> . moreover, this method can be useful in the case of low copy number sines and lines since at last only a population of sequences enriched for specific retroposons is cloned. generally the frequency of positive clones can reach 50–90% if conditions were optimized  <cit> . so it shows great advantage when usually a great number of retroposon insertions need be isolated as temporal landmarks of evolution for estimations of phylogeny.

most steps in the protocol presented here can be readily modified to suit different experimental backgrounds and knowledge about sine and line and can easily combine with other protocols. okada's group successfully isolated many sine families from many organisms by using the in vitro transcript of total genomic dna as the probes utilizing the properties that sines are redundant in the genome and transcribed by rna polymerase iii  <cit> . while kramerov's group prefered to use ab-pcr product containing a 30– <dig> bp sequence located between boxes a and b of sine as a probe  <cit> . all these specific probes including known sine sequence  can be biotinylated to join into this enrichment strategy.

but it is noted that there are many principles that should be kept in mind. firstly, correct restriction enzyme should be selected to generate appropriate size fragments evenly and its recognized sites should not exist in the targeted repeat elements. in our work, although we isolated sines and lines simultaneously at one isolation reaction, we only obtained the haeiii-fragmented partial lines because of the existed haeiii site in full-size lines. secondly, the amplification cycles of step pcr enrichment and adapter pcr  should be optimized to generate a smear of the pcr products without specific bands. in this case,  <dig> and  <dig> of cycles were done in the two steps respectively to keep the complexity of dna molecules for preventing the generation of a lot of identical clones at last. moreover, the selectivity and specificity can be adjusted by altering specific probe and the stringency conditions . thirdly, there are several methods for labeling one biotin at one terminus of the dna fragment such as pcr method with one of the two primers biotinylated , end-labeling using terminal transferase, ligation reaction with a biotinylated adaptor  <cit>  or direct generated by company service. no matter which method to be used, it is important to label only one biotin molecule at one terminus of the dna fragment, otherwise magnetic beads will crosslink and clot through dna bridges, which may result in poor reaction kinetics between beads and target molecules. in addition, isolation of large size of dna fragments may be limited by beads binding ability and cloning efficiency of large fragments into t-vector. however, our procedures mainly base on pcr and hence could be use to track the progress of the entire process from step to step by gel electrophoresis.

CONCLUSIONS
the young hamo sine family and its partner hamo line <dig> family shared a common 3'tail region in two carp fishes, indicated the retropositional parasitism of hamo sines on hamo lines and strengthened already proposed hypotheses including the formation of the stem loop structure in 3'tail region of some sines and lines and the mechanism of template switching in generating new sine family. the finding of repeat sequences in the 3' tail of the hamo sines strengthened the slippage model for initiation of reverse transcription. the obtained results show that the developed new protocol for isolation of sine and line are advantages and technically straightforward. the characterization of new sine and line pair is also beneficial to the future study about the molecular systematics of cyprinid fish.
