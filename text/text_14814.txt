BACKGROUND
mature t lymphocytes must express heterodimeric α and β or γ and δ chain t cell receptors  on its surface in order to provide protection from pathogens. the diversity of the tr repertoire derives in large part from the random somatic rearrangements of variable , diversity  and joining  genes in the case of δ and β chain, and variable  and joining  genes in the case of γ, and α chain encoding the variable portion of these molecules during the t-cell differentiation.

the vj process requires the binding of the lymphocyte-specific recombination activating gene  <dig> and  <dig>  protein complex to recombination signal sequences  flanking the rearranging sides of the individual v, d and j genes  <cit> . upon binding, the rag1/ <dig> recombinases introduce a nick at the border between the rs heptamer and the adjacent coding sequence. the dna repair factors of the nonhomologous end-joining  machinery join the nicked genes  <cit> . the rss consist of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences, separated by a spacer of  <dig> or  <dig> bp of relatively non-conserved dna. efficient recombination involves pairs of genes flanked by dissimilar 12- and 23rss   <cit> . however, at the locus encoding for the β-chain , despite the 12/ <dig> compatibility, the trbd 12rss, but not the trbj 12rss efficiently target vβ 23rss. this phenomenon termed "beyond 12/ <dig> rule"  <cit> , preserving the trbd gene utilization, ensures an ordered vj recombination at the trb locus with the trbd-to-trbj joining which occurs before the trbv-to-trbd gene assembly.

diversity at the recombination level is further enhanced by other processes that include the exonuclease digestion  of 3'-v, 5'- and 3'-d, and 5'-j genes, the imprecise joining of nicked genes, and the addition of non germline nucleotides  at the v-j, v-d and d-j junctions. for this reason the product of the vj joining, corresponding to the cdr <dig> region in the chain, is markedly polymorphic and is dominant in the recognition of peptide. after transcription, the vj sequence is spliced to the constant  gene.

the resources available to generate the potential repertoires and to establish the regulation are described by the genomic organization of the tr loci. in most species of mammals, the trb locus has the common feature of a library of trbv genes positioned at the 5'- end of two in tandem aligned d-j-c gene clusters, each composed of a single trbd, 6- <dig> trbj and one trbc genes, followed by a single trbv gene with an inverted transcriptional orientation located at the 3'-end. this genomic organization is reported well conserved from human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , chimpanzee  <cit> , rhesus monkey  <cit> , and horse  <cit> . a peculiar feature of the mammalian trb locus is the presence of two very similar trbc genes, since they differ by only a few residues in the coding region; conversely, they are different in their own 3'-utr regions.

in the artiodactyls lineage, i.e., in sheep  <cit>  as well as in cattle  <cit>  and in pig  <cit> , a duplication event within the 3'-end of the trb locus has led to the generation of a third d-j-c cluster. the presence of an additional cluster produces an increase in the number of d and j genes available to partake in somatic recombination, but also expand the distance between the enhancer  and the promoter  elements within the locus. surprisingly also, in presence of three d-j-c clusters, both the nucleotide and protein sequences of all three trbc genes are highly similar. only four amino acid residues have undergone replacement in the trbc <dig> gene with respect to the trbc <dig> and trbc <dig> genes, while the trbc <dig> 3'-utr region is identical to that of trbc <dig> gene  <cit> . the amino acid replacements were located, two in the n- terminus and one in the e β-strand and in the fg loop of well-defined regions of the extracellular domain of the trbc molecule  <cit> .

to know if the altered genomic architecture of the ruminant trb locus can modify the mechanisms of recombination, we investigated on the β-chain repertoire in sheep. for this purpose we produced a collection of cdnas derived from four different tissues belonging to four different adult animals of three diverse sheep breeds. as the genomic organization is known, the exact interpretation of the β chain transcripts was determined. the results of the analyses clearly demonstrate that sheep possess a repertoire of functional trβ genes that is substantially larger than that described for other mammalian species, but also that other mechanisms as trans-rearrangement, intrallelic trans-splicing and dna recombinational diversification involving the constant regions seem to shape the β-chain repertoire in a consistent way. however, the general paradigms of the mammalian trb regulation seem to be preserved.

RESULTS
analysis of β-chain transcripts
a previous study on cloning and sequencing of the sheep trb locus revealed that the d-j-c region is organized in three independent clusters tandem aligned, with d-j-c cluster  <dig> additional with respect to the other mammalian trb loci  <cit> . d-j-c cluster  <dig> contains one trbd, six trbj and one trbc gene. d-j-c cluster  <dig>  located at  <dig>  kb downstream cluster  <dig>  includes one trbd, five trbj and one trbc gene. finally, d-j-c cluster  <dig> is positioned at  <dig>  kb downstream cluster  <dig> with one trbd, seven trbj and one trbc gene .

to evaluate the contribution of each gene cluster in the formation of the β-chain repertoire, a total of  <dig> clones containing rearranged v-d-j-c transcripts with a correct open reading frame were analyzed. all cdna clones were registered in embl database with the accession numbers from fm <dig> to fm <dig>   <dig> of these clones were derived from perinatal thymus  of a moscia leccese breed sheep,  <dig> from adult thymus  and  <dig> from spleen  of a gentile di puglia breed sheep,  <dig> from peripheral blood  of a sarda ionica breed sheep. the clones were obtained by rt-pcr. the 5' primer was chosen on the ylcass amino acid motif of the trbv genes as members of the trbv subgroups with this motif which seem to be the most frequently used  <cit>  while the 3'-primer was designed on a conserved region of the three trbc genes  <cit> .

the deduced amino acid sequences of the v-d-j regions of all  <dig> cdna clones are reported in the table  <dig> together with the corresponding trbc genes, according to the tissue of origin. among the clones only one sequence is shared between blood  and adult thymus . no tissue-specific expression of the genes was found. a total of  <dig> trbj genes were recovered within the different cdnas. thus, only one out of  <dig> functional trbj genes present in the genomic sequence was completely absent . besides, all trbj sequences match well with the corresponding genomic ones, and the high level of sequence similarity observed among the different animals is consistent with a close phylogeny of sheep breeds. the trbj <dig> cluster seems to be preferentially used  and, although the numbers are too low to be statistically relevant, a slight increase in the use of trbj <dig>   and trbj <dig>   genes can be observed. moreover,  <dig> clones retain a member of the trbj <dig> cluster, with the trbj <dig>  gene  more frequently used, while  <dig> clones retain the trbj <dig> gene set, without any preferential usage.

three nucleotide differences at the n-terminus allow to distinguish the three trbc gene isotypes: trbc <dig> differs with respect to trbc <dig> and trbc <dig> genes for two nucleotide substitutions in the third and fourth codons; trbc <dig>  is distinguishable from trbc <dig> because of a silent nucleotide substitution at the third position of the first codon  <cit> . on the basis of these criteria, the n-terminus of the trbc portions within the cdna sequences was analyzed and a significant group of cdnas with the trbc <dig> gene  identified. moreover,  <dig> clones retain the trbc <dig>  and  <dig> clones are with the trbc <dig>  gene .

more complex is the determination and the contribution of the genes involved in the cdr <dig> formation. the cdr <dig> β region is defined as a stretch of nucleotides running after the codon encoding the cystein in position  <dig> of the trbv gene to the codon before that which encodes the phenylalanine of the fgxg motif of the trbj gene http://imgt.cines.fr/ <cit> . the corresponding amino acid sequence of the cdr <dig> loop deduced from the nucleotide sequences reveals that it is heterogeneous for amino acid composition . the mean length of the cdr <dig> loop was approximately the same in spleen  and adult thymus , but larger in blood  and young thymus . for comparison, human peripheral blood cdr3β loop is about  <dig>  residue long  <cit>  and mouse is  <dig>  residue long  <cit> . a similar cdr <dig> length and size range was reported in thymus and peripheral blood lymphocytes of piglets   <cit> .

for a close inspection of the cdr <dig> s, the nucleotide sequences have been excised from each cdna sequence and analyzed in detail. in the absence of the trbv germline sequences, the deletions at the 3'-end of the trbv and the nucleotide addition at the v-d junctions cannot be accurately estimated. however, the comparison of the  <dig> v-d-j junctions after the ass motif allowed the determination of the probable 3'-end of the trbv gene that has not been trimmed by exonuclease during rearrangement in a significant proportion of sequences . by the comparison of the trbd genomic sequences, the nucleotides located in the cdr <dig> regions were considered to belong to a trbd gene if they constituted a stretch of at least four consecutive residues corresponding to the trbd <dig>  trbd <dig> or trbd <dig> germline sequences. in this way the  <dig> sequences were grouped according to the trbd <dig> , trbd <dig>  or trbd <dig>  gene usage.  <dig> sequences with no recognizable trbd genes were grouped separately . these last sequences could be interpreted as direct v-j junctions. however, it is also possible that nucleotide trimming masked the initial participation of d gene during the rearrangement. in the other cases the degree of germline nucleotide trimming in the 3'-v and 5'-j as well as the 5' and 3' d region is similar in all groups . nucleotides that could not be attributed to any template sequence are considered n-elements. the mean length for n-d-n addition, including d region, is  <dig> nt  for the first group ,  <dig>  nt  for the second group  and  <dig> nt  for the group with trbd <dig> participation . the mean of n addition in the clones without trbd sequence  is  <dig>  nt . particular features of the cdr <dig> region of the clones are the presence within the d region of nucleotide substitutions as well as the presence of insertion  and deletion  with respect to the germline sequences. although the numbers are too low to be statistically relevant, a trend towards longer cdr <dig> length in trbd <dig>  with respect to trbd <dig>  and trbd <dig> , or with no apparent trbd  transcripts was evident.

these data together suggest that all three trb d-j-c clusters are used to generate in sheep functional tr β-chain with no specific influence of any clusters.

analysis of the d-j-c rearrangements
since the genomic organization of the 3' region of the sheep trb locus is known   <cit> , the formal interpretation of the d-j-c arrangements is possible. the intra-cluster rearrangements represent a consistent portion of the repertoire , with  <dig> trbd1-trbj <dig>   <dig> trbd3-trbj <dig> and  <dig> trbd2-trbj <dig> rearrangements . a similar number of rearrangements  can be interpreted by direct 5'- to- 3' joining across the clusters  with  <dig> trbd1-trbj <dig>   <dig> trbd1-trbj <dig> and  <dig> trbd3-trbj <dig> rearrangements . interestingly, we also observed two trbd2-trbj <dig>  and one trbd3-trbj <dig>  joining. since the d- j-c cluster  <dig> is located downstream d- j-c cluster  <dig> as well as d- j-c cluster  <dig> is downstream d- j-c cluster  <dig> within the trb locus, both these junctions may only be explained by chromosomal inversion, or with more probability, by trans-rearrangement occurring during trb locus recombination.

a systematic analysis of the constant region of the transcripts also revealed that multiple splice variants are present. in fact, the canonical splicing is present in 49/ <dig>  clones with  <dig> trbj1-trbc <dig>   <dig> trbj3-trbc <dig> and  <dig> trbj2-trbc <dig> transcripts . a group of  <dig> clones  comes from an alternative or cis-splicing mechanism . finally, it is noteworthy that  <dig> clones  with trbj <dig> genes showed trbc <dig> or trbc <dig> instead of the expected trbc <dig> gene. since trbc <dig> as well as trbc <dig> genes are located upstream trbj <dig> cluster in the germline dna, trbj <dig> joined to trbc <dig> or trbc <dig> sequences cannot be a cis-spliced product of a single precursor rna. consequently, they must be the product of a trans-splicing between a transcript with trbj2-trbc <dig> genes and a transcript containing trbc <dig> or trbc <dig> genes.

we excluded that all these non canonical sequences may be the result of pcr artifacts since the crossover points have not as expected a random distribution, but they always lie at the d-j or/and j-c junction, giving rise to products of the appropriate length and sequence.

the presence of splice variants may suggest the involvement of the trbc gene in generating the tr β-chain functional diversity.

structure of the trbc region
to complete the analysis of the trbc domain in the cdna clones, the whole constant portion of the transcripts was retrieved from the sequences and aligned according to the three trbc isotypes for each animal in the different tissues.

the comparison of the  <dig> cdnas showed the presence of different sequences that can be identified for the nucleotide variability in  <dig> different positions,  <dig> located in the first and two in the third exon, resulting in six amino acid substitutions all grouped in the first exon, and as a consequence, in the extracellular domain of the chain . by means of these variations, we observed a number of different sequences in excess. for example, five different groups of sequences were assigned to the trbc <dig> gene in the young thymus of the moscia leccese breed individual. this number is certainly higher than the expected two allelic forms, at the most, of the gene. in order to understand the origin of the additional sequences, we have isolated by pcr the allelic variants of all three trbc genes from the young thymus genomic dna of the moscia leccese individual, used as a reference model with respect to the others. the specificity of the pcr reactions was achieved by using a reverse primer which binds to either trbc <dig> and trbc <dig>  or trbc <dig> 3'-utr  sequences, and completely trbc specific forward primers complementary to a specific region upstream the trbc <dig> , trbc <dig>  and trbc <dig>  coding regions . the three different pcr products were sequenced, and in every case, two allelic forms for each trbc gene were obtained . the comparison of the genomic with the corresponding sequences within the young thymus cdnas allows us to establish that the first two more abundant groups of trbc <dig> sequences represent the two allelic forms of the trbc <dig> genes , while alternative splicing of the third exon and dna recombinational diversification process with the trbc <dig> gene can have generated the other three groups of trbc <dig> sequences . moreover, the two groups of trbc <dig> cdna sequences  perfectly matched with the two allelic forms . only one allelic form was recovered for the trbc <dig> gene , while the other trbc <dig> sequence can have been generated by a mechanism of dna recombinational diversification with the allele of trbc <dig> gene .

after deducing the allelic variants of the three constant genes in the other tissues, alternative splicing and recombinational diversification can explain the excess of the sequences also in those cases.

discussion
to validate the real participation of the third additional d-j-c cluster and compare its usage with respect to the others in the formation of the tr β-chain repertoire, we analyzed transcripts of  <dig> unique d-j-c rearrangements recovered from four different tissues of four different animals, belonging to three different ovine breeds. although the analyzed sequences lacked the trbv genes, the presence of the cdr <dig> β region, the trbj gene as well as most of the trbc gene sequence was sufficient to permit a comprehensive analysis of the expressed tr β chain. data presented here show that the mechanisms for generating diversity in sheep β chain polypeptides appear to adhere to the paradigms established through the study of humans and rodents. however, the diversity is enhanced by somatic rearrangement of  <dig> trbd and  <dig> trbj genes that, by virtue of the expected recombination imprecision and n-region addition, maximizes diversity in the cdr <dig> region, thus expanding the potential repertoire of antigen specificities . in spite of the presence of a longer coding nucleotide sequence in trbd genes if compared with the human and mouse counterpart  <cit> , the overall size of the cdr <dig> region is conserved in all tissues among the different mammalian species . this conservation was archived by a greater deletion at the 5'end of trbj genes and a concomitant increase in n-nucleotide addition at the v-d-j junction during rearrangement . this suggests that the length of cdr <dig> in tr β chain is essential for t-cell function.

while there is not a specific influence of any cluster in the formation of the sheep β-chain in the different tissues, a dissimilar usage of the genes can be identified and it could depend on the sheep trb genomic organization. consistent with a promoter-enhancer facilitated recombination model, in human and mouse, assembly of the djβ <dig> cassette is dependent on the interaction of the enhancer with the pdβ <dig> promoter positioned immediately 5' of the trbd <dig> gene. assembly of djβ <dig> proceeds independent from that of djβ <dig>  albeit with less efficiency. also in this case, an undefined pdβ <dig> region continues to associate with the enhancer  <cit> . our analyses suggest that also in sheep the mechanisms selectively alter d usage, so that the "privileged" trbd <dig> gene can account for the 60% of the total clones with respect to  <dig> % of trbd <dig> and  <dig> % of trbd <dig>  this may reside in the greater efficiency of the pdβ <dig> promoter activity with respect to the pdβ <dig> or pdβ <dig>  a striking conservation of the pdβ <dig> and pdβ <dig>  regions among sheep, human and mouse  <cit>  can support this observation, whereas the activity of the two similar pdβ <dig> and pdβ <dig> promoters could be correlated with their position from 5' to 3' within the locus.

the prominent utilization of the members of the trbj <dig> with respect to the trbj <dig> and trbj <dig> sets, as deducted from our cdna collection, results from inter cluster or trans-rearrangements. it is possible that the preferential usage of the trbj <dig> set could depend on the number of genes that lie in the genomic region, if multiple jβ 12-rss are important for increasing the local concentration of the rag proteins that first bind a 12-rs and then capture a 23-rs to form a synaptic complex  <cit> . in this regard, it is notable that the six sheep trbj <dig> genes lie in about  <dig>  kb, the five trbj <dig> genes in about  <dig> bp, while the seven trbj <dig> genes are grouped in about  <dig> kb. recently, franchini et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated, by means of an in vitro rag1/ <dig> mediated dna coupled cleavage assay using various pair-wise rs combinations, that in mouse, the coupled cleavage of dβ1-jβ <dig> and dβ2-jβ <dig> substrates are similar and are both weak if compared to dβ1-jβ <dig> substrates, suggesting that jβ <dig> rss are better partners than jβ <dig> rss. in the same way, in sheep there could be the presence of a hierarchy efficiency of coupled cleavage with the dβ1-jβ <dig> > dβ1-jβ <dig> > dβ1-jβ <dig> 

as the increment of the number of trbd and trbj genes produces larger variation in tr β chain, particularly in cdr <dig> region as expected, similarly, the presence of an additional trbc gene seems to affect the variety of the β chain repertoire. in fact careful analysis of the cdna constant regions obtained from the different animals showed a level of unexpected variability in the first exon of the trbc genes  if compared with that established in the genomic sequence  <cit> . by using the single nucleotide variations present in the first and third exon of the trbc genes as hallmarks, we demonstrated that alternative splicing concerning the first and/or the third exon and/or somatic recombinatiorial processes are involved in the diversification of the constant region of the sheep β-chain. the alternative splicing can occur either in cis or in trans. the presence of a cis-splicing mechanism comes from the analysis of six clones with trbj1-trbc <dig> and trbj3-trbc <dig> arrangement, while the presence of a trans-splicing process derives from the analysis of  <dig> clones with trbj <dig> spliced to trbc <dig> or trbc <dig> instead of the expected trbc <dig> gene . trbj <dig> to trbc <dig> or trbc <dig> splicing could be possible only when trbv-trbd-trbj transcripts are spliced with a transcript of the other allele. as a consequence, trans-splicing of two rna separate precursors is the only logical possibility. the involvement of interallelic trans-splicing has already been documented in igh chains  <cit> . beyond this case the presence of interallelic trans-splicing in vertebrates is problematical to demonstrate. it has been documented to be an essential process for the expression of the lola drosophila gene. lola encodes  <dig> protein isoforms belonging to a family of btb zinc-finger transcriptional factor  <cit> . genetic tests have demonstrated that some isoforms were generating thought intrallelic trans-splicing  <cit> . no particular sequences for trans-splicing have been identified around the exon-intron boundary in the lola gene; therefore, the basic mechanism of trans-splicing is likely to be shared with those of cis-splicing and occur co-transcriptionally where nascent pre mrna are produced in close proximity, as is the case for cis-splicing  <cit> . it is possible that also in sheep trb locus, the cis and trans-splicing shared the same mechanism.

investigation of the constant domain of the sheep cdnas led us to deduce that a minimal set of sequences are also generated by a somatic recombinatorial process . somatic recombinatorial diversification occurs in vertebrates, yeast and plants  <cit> , and such a modification of germline sequences can generate individuals with different starting gene repertoires in different tissues.

the precise effect and significance of the variability in the constant region of tr β-chain remain to be determined. it might create diversity in the t cell function. the extracellular domain of the trbc molecule consists of well-defined regions  <cit> . the pattern of amino acid replacements in the sheep cdna was located, beyond the n- terminus, one both in the trbc e β-strand and in the de loop and two in the fg loop. this last is tr β-chain specific loop in all mammalian species and contains  <dig> residues that are conserved between the two trbc isotypes in human and mouse. in sheep sequences, the fg loop is one amino acid longer and underwent replacement among the three trbc genes. so the gln in position  <dig> in the first half part of the loop can be replaced by glu; while the asp in position  <dig> of the second part of the loop can be substituted by ala . three-dimensional structures of the tr  <cit>  have shown that the fg loop of the tr β chain exists as an elongated, rigid element forming a sidewall of a cavity created by the asymmetric disposition of cα and cβ domains that receive the ε subunit of the cd <dig> complex  <cit> . therefore a primary function of the cβ fg loop in the thymus is to facilitate negative selection, while following maturation, αβ t cells are dependent on the cβ fg loop to their activation  <cit> . our hypothesis is that amino acid replacement in the fg loop of the sheep trbc genes can be modified by the sensitivity of αβ t cell for cognate peptide recognition, and this can be correlated with the function of the αβ t cell in sheep.

CONCLUSIONS
all together our results show that in sheep the presence of an additional d-j-c cluster enhances the β-chain repertoire. these findings, together with the evidence of the expansion of gene repertoires for other tr loci in ruminants  <cit> , suggest that strong evolutionary pressures have driven a generic enlargement of tr gene numbers, thus generating a greater potential tr diversity in this lineage.
