BACKGROUND
phosphoinositide 3-kinases  are a ubiquitous family of lipid kinases that catalyse the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide lipids at the 3’ position on the inositide ring  <cit> . the class 1a sub-group exists as heterodimers of a p <dig> catalytic subunit and a p <dig> regulatory subunit that can phosphorylate three phosphoinositides -p and pi--p2) in vitro, but are thought to primarily phosphorylate pi--p2in vivo to form pi--p <dig>   <cit> . pip <dig> resides almost exclusively in the plasma membrane and propagates signals by recruiting and activating a variety of downstream proteins that contain pip <dig> binding domains  domains)  <cit> . pi3k/pip <dig> signalling regulates a wide range of cellular processes including cell growth, survival, glucose metabolism and migration  <cit> .

the prototypic class 1a pi3k is a heterodimer of the α isoforms of p <dig> and p <dig> . mutations in pik3ca, the gene encoding p110α, are oncogenic  <cit>  and are frequently reported in breast and colon cancers, where they are found in around 25% of human tumours  <cit> . tumour-associated pik3ca mutations are all somatic, mono-allelic single base changes that result in single amino acid substitutions. the majority  of mutations cluster in exon  <dig>  or exon  <dig> , most commonly e542k and e545k in exon  <dig> and h1047r in exon  <dig>  <cit> . cancer-associated, mutated forms of pi3kα are associated with increased phosphoinositide kinase activity  <cit> , leading to up-regulation of downstream signalling events such as phosphorylation of akt and s <dig>  <cit> .

class 1a pi3ks also have protein kinase activity. the p110α catalytic subunit can phosphorylate its regulatory subunit, p85α, at serine  <dig> . phosphorylation of this site has been reported to result in feed-back inhi-bition by down-modulating the lipid kinase activity of p110α  <cit> , however the role of phosphorylation of s <dig> in signalling by endogenous pi3kα and the structural mechanism of down-modulation of lipid kinase activity by s <dig> phosphorylation are not well described. we have assessed the possibility that the increased lipid kinase activities of oncogenic mutants of pi3kα could be partly due to alterations in the phosphorylation of s <dig>  rather than make point mutations in s <dig>  which can potentially subtly alter the structure and thus the activity of p110α/p85α heterodimers, we have manipulated the levels of phosphorylation of s <dig> of highly-purified, recombinant p110α/p85α in vitro and tested the effect on lipid kinase activity. neither complete dephosphorylation nor a high percentage occupancy of s <dig> by a phosphate group significantly altered the lipid kinase activity of wild-type pi3kα. the levels and kinetics of s <dig> phosphorylation in two oncogenic mutants, e545k and h1047r, were not significantly different to that of wild-type p110α/p85α and the lipid kinase activities of mutant pi3kα were similarly unaffected by phosphorylation of s <dig>  this suggests that phosphorylation of s <dig> is not a significant regulator of pi3kα lipid kinase activity.

RESULTS
expression, purification and characterisation of recombinant wild-type and mutant pi3kα
the same strategy that was used to express and purify active, recombinant bovine p110α/p85α  <cit>  was used to generate human, c-terminally ee-tagged, full length, wild-type p110α/p85α in sf <dig> insect cells using the bac-n-blue baculovirus system. when sf <dig> cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding both subunits, p <dig> was expressed at higher levels than p110αee, therefore to obtain purified p110αee/p85α, affinity chromatography using an antibody directed against the epitope tag  was used to capture the enzyme complex but not excess p85α. competitive elution with an ee-tag peptide , followed by anion exchange chromatography were performed as described  <cit> . pi3k purified in this way comprises a homogeneous 1: <dig> complex of the p110α and p85α subunits as assessed by both sds-page  and analytical size exclusion chromatography  <cit> . recombinant p110αee/p85α was estimated to be > 95% pure based on densitometry of the relative levels of all coomassie blue-stained bands in each lane and no peptides other than those derived from p110αee or p85α were detected by lc-ms/ms of tryptic digests of the purified recombinant complex. we have also expressed and purified to homogeneity ee-tagged complexes of p85α with p110α containing two of the most common cancer-associated mutations from two different regions of p110α  .


oncogenic mutants of pi3kα have been reported to have higher lipid kinase activity than wild-type  <cit> . as shown previously  <cit> , recombinant forms of the p110αeee545k/p85α and p110αeeh1047r/p85α complexes have higher lipid kinase activities than p110αeewt/p85α. the h1047r mutant had higher activity than the e545k mutant . kinetic parameters were derived for recombinant wild type and mutant p110αee/p85α complexes by varying the concentration of atp and measuring initial reaction rates , and showed that, when pi was used as the substrate, the km for h1047r and e545k were similar to wild type. when pi--p <dig> was used as a substrate, the km for h1047r was decreased approximately 2-fold compared to wild type, but that for e545k was not significantly different. both mutants showed a significant  <dig> to 4-fold increase in vmax when either pi or pi--p <dig> was used as a substrate, with the vmax for h1047r being significantly higher than that for e545k . the kinetic characteristics of purified, recombinant, ee-tagged forms of wild-type and mutant pi3kα are therefore essentially the same as those previously reported for purified, recombinant his-tagged forms of pi3kα  <cit>  and endogenous wild-type and mutant pi3k  <cit> .

effect of dephosphorylation of p85α s <dig> on pi3kα lipid kinase activity
s <dig> in the p <dig> subunit is a substrate for the protein kinase activity of pi3kα  <cit> . phosphorylation of s <dig> by p <dig> is reported to down-regulate pi3kα lipid kinase activity  <cit> . this raises the possibility that higher lipid kinase activities of oncogenic mutants of pi3kα could be partly due to alterations in the levels of phosphorylation of s <dig> 

to better compare lipid kinase activities of wild-type and mutant pi3kα that were phosphorylated or unphosphorylated at s <dig>  we opted to manipulate phosphorylation levels of recombinant p110αee/p85α complexes in vitro rather than to make point mutations in s <dig>  to perform lipid kinase assays with dephosphorylated pi3kα, it was necessary to find a phosphatase that dephosphorylated p85α but not inositol lipids. we compared three different protein phosphatases . we have previously used antarctic phosphatase to dephosphorylate affinity-precipitated proteins for characterisation on 2d gels  <cit> , however antarctic phosphatase was inactive at temperatures >4°c that are required for significant lipid and protein kinase activity of pi3kα, and so had no effect on levels of phosphorylation of p85α or pi at room temperature . alkaline phosphatase is a broad spectrum phosphatase that was able to dephosphorylate both s <dig> and pi-3-p. in contrast, recombinant λ phosphatase dephosphorylated s <dig> but not pi-3-p . λ phosphatase was therefore added to pi kinase assays to continually remove phosphate groups from s <dig> and allow comparison of the lipid kinase activity of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pi3kα.


as expected, inclusion of λ phosphatase in kinase assays resulted in no significant incorporation of 32p-labelled phosphate groups into p85α, demonstrating that levels of p85α phosphorylation were low in the presence of λ phosphatase . dephosphorylated p110αeewt/p85α did not have a significantly different pi kinase activity to p110αeewt/p85α that became phosphorylated on p85α over the course of the assay . similarly, the e545k and h1047r mutants did not have significantly different pi kinase activities when p85α was either dephosphorylated or phosphorylated, although the pi kinase activities of p110αeee545k/p85α and p110αeeh1047r/p85α were higher than that of p110αeewt/p85α as expected . interestingly, as observed previously  <cit> , the protein kinase activities of p110αeee545k/p85α and p110αeeh1047r/p85α were not significantly different to that of p110αeewt/p85α .

it is possible that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of s <dig> remains low after the  <dig> minute kinase reaction used, and thus lipid kinase activities of dephosphorylated and only partially phosphorylated p110αee/p85α were compared in figure 2b. we therefore performed a time-course to determine whether a difference in activity of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated p110αee/p85α became apparent with increasing levels of phosphorylation of p85α. levels of phosphorylation of s <dig> became saturated after approximately  <dig> minutes . in some assays, the level of phosphorylation of the e545k mutant was apparently higher than wild-type pi3kα or the h1047r mutant, although this was an inconsistent observation and was not significantly different in most assays. when λ phosphatase was added, lack of incorporation of 32p into p85α demonstrated that λ phosphatase continued to dephosphorylate s <dig> throughout the assay. . despite apparently saturating phosphorylation of s <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig> minutes, the difference in the pi kinase activity of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated wild-type, e545k or h1047r pi3kα did not increase over time , suggesting that phosphorylation of s <dig> does not regulate the pi kinase activity in either wild-type or mutant pi3kα.

effect of phosphorylation of p85α s <dig> on pi3kα lipid kinase activity
to ensure that the apparent lack of difference in pi kinase activity of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated pi3kα was not due to a low stoichiometry of phosphorylation, even when levels were apparently saturated, we allowed the phosphorylation reaction to proceed for 16– <dig> hours using unlabelled atp or no atp for the mock phosphorylation reaction. phosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated pi3kα were buffer exchanged to remove excess cold atp, then the extent of phosphorylation of s <dig> was measured using maldi-ms of tryptic digests of wild-type and mutant pi3kα. overlapping tryptic peptides containing s <dig> were observed at m/z  <dig>  and m/z  <dig>  in mock or unphosphorylated pi3kα . phosphorylation of pi3kα led to the appearance of peptides at m/z  <dig>  and m/z  <dig>  , which are  <dig> mass units greater than the masses of the peptides containing non-phosphorylated s <dig> and suggest that these peptides incorporated one phosphate group per peptide. there was no evidence for phosphorylation of peptides other than those containing s <dig>  to estimate the extent of phosphorylation of s <dig>  we normalised the spectra to the height of a peptide at m/z  <dig>  that is not altered when pi3kα is phosphorylated, and compared the heights of the peaks of non-phosphorylated s608-containing peptides. phosphorylation of p110αeewt/p85α led to almost complete disappearance of the peaks at m/z  <dig>  and m/z  <dig>  corresponding to non-phosphorylated s <dig>  suggesting that at least 90% of p110αeewt/p85α was phosphorylated on s <dig> . in support of this, the amount of 32p incorporated into p85α in a subsequent protein kinase time-course assay was negligible, suggesting that nearly all s <dig> residues were already occupied by an unlabelled phosphate group . the extent of phosphorylation of p85α s <dig> in p110αeee545k/p85α and p110αeeh1047r/p85α was less than that observed for p110αeewt/p85α, as the heights of the peaks at m/z  <dig>  and m/z  <dig>  were less decreased by phosphorylation compared to the height of the same peaks in mock-phosphorylated p110αeee545k/p85α and p110αeeh1047r/p85α , suggesting that a small proportion of mutant pi3kα remained unphosphorylated after  <dig> hours. in agreement, low levels of 32p were incorporated into p85α in subsequent protein kinase time-course assays , suggesting that a small proportion of s <dig> in the e545k and h1047r mutants was not occupied by an unlabelled phosphate group. nevertheless, the majority of p110αeee545k/p85α and p110αeeh1047r/p85α was phosphorylated on s <dig> under these conditions.


the pi kinase activities of phosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated wild-type pi3kα were not significantly different over a  <dig> hour time-course. similarly, the pi kinase activities of phosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated e545k and h1047r pi3kα were not significantly different, although the activities of h1047r, and to a lesser extent e545k, were higher than that of wild-type pi3kα. nearly stoichiometric phosphorylation of s <dig> therefore did not affect the pi kinase activity of wild-type or mutant pi3kα, further suggesting that phosphorylation of s <dig> does not regulate pi kinase activity.

discussion
as reported previously for bovine pi3kα  <cit> , we have successfully expressed and purified recombinant complexes of full-length human p110α and p85α, the prototypic form of class 1a pi3k using the strategy of selecting for the of p110αee/p85α complex by placing a  <dig> amino acid epitope tag at the c-terminus of the p110α, the subunit with limiting expression levels. the addition of c-terminal ee tag to p110α did not appear to affect pi3kα, as recombinant p110αee/p85α had high stability and the expected activity and substrate specificity. high purity recombinant pi3kα allowed us to assess the relative phosphoinositide lipid and protein kinase activities of wild-type and two common, tumour-associated mutants of pi3kα.

purified, recombinant oncogenic mutant forms of pi3kα had higher lipid kinase activities compared to wild-type pi3kα  as expected  <cit> . the atp km was not significantly different between wild-type and mutant forms of pi3kα  as previously reported  <cit> . however, there was a significant difference in atp vmax when either pi or pi--p <dig> was used as a substrate, in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . this suggests that mutant forms of pi3kα phosphorylate and turn over inositol lipids more rapidly, rather than having inherent higher substrate affinities, thus generating increased levels of pip <dig> and potentially partially explaining increased downstream signalling when the pi3k pathway is activated.

pi3kα also has protein kinase activity and has been reported to phosphorylate a number of protein substrates  <cit>  as well as its own p85α regulatory subunit on s <dig>  <cit> . the role of s <dig> phosphorylation in the regulation of pi3kα lipid kinase activity remains controversial. despite previous reports that phosphorylation of s <dig> down-regulates the lipid kinase activity of the p110α catalytic subunit, we did not find any evidence to support this by in vitro manipulation of the levels of phosphorylation of s <dig> of purified, recombinant p110αee/p85α using either a protein phosphatase or saturating pre-phosphorylation. the reason for this discrepancy is not clear. in two studies, semi-purified recombinant pi3kα was used to show phosphorylation of s <dig> reduces the lipid kinase activity of p110α  <cit> . semi-purified pi3kα can be unstable, thus it is possible that the apparent decrease in the lipid kinase activity of semi-purified pi3kα over time was due to p110α degradation rather than s <dig> phosphorylation. a number of other studies have not observed a decrease in lipid kinase activity of recombinant, purified or immunoprecipitated pi3kα in time-course assays  <cit> .

the time-course of pip <dig> formation by endogenous pi3k in cells shows an initial increase, followed by a decrease in pip <dig> levels  <cit> , but this is largely due to the action of inositol 3- and 5-phosphatases that directly dephosphorylate pip <dig> to form pi--p <dig> or pi--p <dig> respectively  <cit> . the phosphorylation of s <dig> in cells increases upon stimulation with insulin or pdgf  <cit> , which mirrors activation of the lipid kinase activity of pi3kα, thus it is not clear whether phosphorylation of s <dig> down-regulates endogenous pi3kα activity. mutation of s <dig> to a non-phosphorylatable residue has been shown to decrease lipid kinase activity rather than increase it, as would be expected if mutation to alanine prevented phospho-s608-induced down regulation of pi kinase activity  <cit> , suggesting that mutation of this residue, which resides in the intersh <dig> domain of p85α, affects pi3kα lipid kinase activity by altering the structure of pi3kα rather than by affecting the phosphorylation status.

phosphorylation of s <dig> has also been reported to lead to dissociation of the p85α and p110α subunits  <cit> . free p110α has higher activity than p110α in complex with p85α but is very unstable and is quickly degraded  <cit> , thus it is possible that the decrease in lipid kinase activity when p85α s <dig> is phosphorylated could be explained by dissociation of p110α and p85α and rapid degradation of free p110α. however, our highly purified recombinant forms of pi3kα, when phosphorylated to saturation on p85α s <dig>  showed no evidence of subunit dissociation by size-exclusion chromatography and no evidence of p110α degradation by sds-page . the lack of observed dissociation, degradation or decrease in lipid kinase activity concomitant with increasing p85α s <dig> phosphorylation in our highly purified, recombinant pi3kα suggests that previous reports of s <dig> phosphorylation resulting in down-regulation of lipid kinase activity were due to the use semi-purified recombinant pi3kα which is non-specifically degraded over time.

a number of mechanisms that regulate pi3kα enzymatic activity have been described, but no single event has been demonstrated to result in full activation of this enzyme. it is likely that full activation of pi3kα is a multi-step process. within the p110α/p85α complex, p110α is both inhibited and structurally stabilised by tight binding to the p85α subunit  <cit> . activation of the pi3kα involves protein-protein interactions that relieve the inhibition of the p110α kinase activity that is due to inter-subunit interactions of p110α with the n-terminal sh <dig> and inter-sh <dig> domains of p85α  <cit> . one mechanism of activation of pi3kα is binding to specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs  present in receptor tyrosine kinases  and cytoplasmic signalling proteins, such as irs- <dig>  to the p85α n- and c-terminal sh <dig> domains  <cit> , which disrupts the inhibitory contact between the p85α n-terminal sh <dig> and the p110α catalytic domain  <cit> . the e545k mutation is thought to increase activity by disrupting the p85α n-terminal sh2/p110α interface, similar to binding of rtks  <cit> . binding of a range of other intracellular proteins, such as activated ras, sh <dig> domain-containing proteins and small gtpases, have also been reported to activate pi3kα  <cit>  but it is not clear whether binding of these ligands directly activates enzyme activity or whether binding results in activation by translocating pi3kα to the plasma membrane, where its lipid substrate is located  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of p85α y <dig> by src family tyrosine kinases has also been shown to increase pi3kα activity  <cit> , but the mechanism is not known.

phosphorylation of p85α s <dig> by pkc  <cit>   has been reported to decrease pi3kα activity. s <dig> is in the inter-sh <dig> domain of p85α, but is not within the section that has been observed to contact p110α  <cit> , therefore it is not clear whether phosphorylation of s <dig> could influence the inter-subunit interactions of p110α and p85α. a model of the structure of p <dig> with the n- terminal sh <dig>  c- terminal sh <dig> and inter-sh <dig> domains of p <dig>  <cit>  suggests that the c-terminal part of the inter-sh <dig> domain  and the c-terminal sh <dig> domain has the potential to contact the catalytic domain of p <dig>  activation of pi3kα due to binding of the p85α c-terminal sh <dig> domain to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins would be expected to be due to a conformational change that disrupts the interface between the p85α c-terminal sh <dig> domain and the p110α catalytic domain, analogous to the disruption of the inhibitory contact between the p85α n-terminal sh <dig> and the p110α catalytic domain. in contrast, for phosphorylation of s <dig> to decrease pi3kα enzymatic activity, it would have to stabilise this interface and oppose the phosphotyrosine binding-induced disruption. regulation of pi3kα by stabilisation of inter-subunit interactions has not yet been demonstrated.

CONCLUSIONS
studies showing a decrease in pi kinase activity of wild-type pi3kα that correlated with increasing p85α s <dig> phosphorylation suggested the possibility that decreased s <dig> phosphorylation of oncogenic pi3kα could be a mechanism underlying its increased pi kinase activity. this study, in which highly purified, recombinant wild-type and oncogenic, mutant pi3kα was dephosphorylated or fully phosphorylated on serine  <dig> in vitro , found no evidence that phosphorylation of s <dig> influenced pi kinase activity. in addition, levels of phosphorylation of oncogenic pi3kα were not different to that of wild-type pi3kα.
