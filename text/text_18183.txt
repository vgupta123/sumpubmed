BACKGROUND
the timescale of the evolution of some of the most successful freshwater microcrustacean groups such as copepods and cladocerans is poorly known or controversial. both groups are comprised of small and often fragile species, whose fossilized body parts might easily be overlooked. copepods appear be predisposed to weak fossilization as they are extremely rare in the subfossil and fossil record and apparently only preserved under very unusual circumstances such as oil seeps  <cit> . tasch  <cit> , however, reasoned  that body parts of cladocerans should be well-preserved in freshwater sediments. of course, the subfossils of cladoceran ephippia  and heavily chitinized body parts are common in lacustrine sediments -- fossilized cladoceran resting eggs had already been reported by  <dig> from the pliocene, the miocene and the eocene  <cit> . tasch  <cit>  "hunted thoroughly" for cladoceran fossils without success in paleozoic freshwater sediments and later predicted that cladocerans probably arose during the mesozoic. proposals of paleozoic records of cladocerans  <cit>  turned out to be of non-cladoceran origin  <cit> , supporting tasch's hypothesis of a later origin for cladocerans. later, authentic mesozoic cladoceran fossils were discovered from several sites  <cit> .

still, for the cladoceran genus daphnia o. f. muller,  <dig> , there is a lack of reliable calibration points from either geographic or from fossil evidence. the present day geographic domination of former gondwanaland regions by the subgenus daphnia  dybowski et grochowski,  <dig> and of former laurasian regions by the subgenus daphnia , and the reciprocal monophyly of each subgenus  <cit>  could indicate an ancient vicariance event in the early cretaceous  <cit> . but, the north-south hemispheric dichotomy of the subgenera in extant daphnia is unapparent in the sparse fossil record -- every cenozoic record with fossilized ephippia from the northern hemisphere reports ctenodaphnia-like fossils   <cit> . moreover, daphnia ephemeralis , the oldest member of the presumed gondwanaland clade  <cit>  is restricted to former laurasia. the oldest fossils of the subgenus daphnia are known from the northern hemisphere only at the german lake messel site  where fossils of ctenodaphnia are also recorded. smirnov  <cit>  assigned impression fossils of mesozoic ephippia to the genus daphnia , but the subgenus was unassigned.

a deeper understanding of the timescale of daphniid evolution has implications beyond biogeography and systematics. daphniids have become the model taxon for ecological genomics and the evolution of inducible defenses  <cit> . the best studied inducible defenses involve responses of daphniids to chemical cues resulting from predation by the phantom midge larvae   <cit> . numerous phenotypic responses  have been reported from daphniids. initial studies indicate that genomic control of inducible defenses is polygenic and complex  <cit> , with a majority of responsive genes having no known homologs  <cit> . indeed species of both major subgenera of daphnia appear to possess complex genomic adaptations to predation by chaoborids  <cit> . the phantom midge family  has an excellent mesozoic fossil record in asian lake fossil beds with thousands of specimens known from at least five locations  <cit> . does the timescale of co-evolution between daphnia and phantom midges extend to the mesozoic?

without reliable independent calibrations, molecular estimates of the divergence of daphnia have also been predictably conflicting. in general, estimates from mitochondrial genes appear consistent with a mesozoic origin of the subgenera  <cit> . nuclear estimates of divergence, however, have been dramatically lower than estimates from mitochondrial genes, a phenomenon that has been attributed to differences in the effective population sizes and responses to selection for the respective genomes. nuclear dna estimates of divergence based on observed mutation rates of drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans have yielded divergence times at  <dig>  my for the subgenera of daphnia  <cit> . this young estimate of divergence requires that the mitochondrial dna estimates and the conclusions of richter and wedmann  <cit> , who assigned damaged ephippia from fish coprolites in eocene deposits  to daphnia  pulex and daphnia  magna, to be spurious  <cit> .

more evidence is needed to resolve the existing profound disagreements of the timescale of evolution for the genus daphnia. importantly, the ephippium has been identified as possessing important diagnostic characters for the subgenera  <cit> . in daphnia  the ephippium is sub-triangular in shape , with axes of two eggs perpendicular or sub-perpendicular to the dorsal margin . in contrast, the ephippium of d.  dybowski & grochowski,  <dig> is usually d-shaped, with the axes of eggs being sub-parallel to dorsal margin . the third subgenus, d.  colbourne, wilson et hebert,  <dig> represented now only by a single species, daphnia occidentalis benzie,  <dig>  has only a single egg in the ephippium  <cit> . we note that some extant ctenodaphnia  and all other daphniid genera, i.e. simocephalus  also have a single large egg in the ephippium.

inspired by the relatively undamaged impression fossils of ephippia reported by smirnov  <cit>  from mesozoic mongolian sediments, we examined existing and new samples from this site. we report that there is fossil evidence for an ancient mesozoic divergence of the subgenera of daphnia. the evidence extends the age of the subgenera by about  <dig> my from existing fossils and by about  <dig> my from ndna mutation rate estimates. further, the co-occurrence of fossils from the subgenera and from chaoborids indicates a coevolutionary history of predator and prey taxa that also dates to the mesozoic.

RESULTS
limestone fragments with clear impressions were assigned specimen numbers and stored at the palaeontological institute of russian academy of sciences. the number of impression fossils per fragment is given in parentheses below. fragments with numbers 4307/ <dig> - 4307/ <dig> were previously discovered by smirnov  <cit>  and re-examined here; fragments with subsequent numbers were newly discovered by aak and described below.

daphnia  sp.?
material examined. 4307/ <dig> .

description. lengths are  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm. the ephippium is sub-triangular, relatively high , with an almost straight dorsal margin. the caudal needle or spine is missing and there is a widely rounded antero-dorsal and postero-dorsal angle . the dorsal portion of the ephippium is a non-reticulated, heavily-chitinized plate . much of the ephippial surface has inflated reticulation . the axes of the two eggs are almost perpendicular to the dorsal margin.

daphnia  sp
material examined. 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> .

description. length  <dig> - <dig>  mm. the ephippia have a varying relative height , with a dorsal plate, and axes of eggs parallel to the dorsal margin. we found size differences among the ephippia of daphnia , but the material is too scarce to designate species. larger ephippia usually have a widely rounded antero-dorsal angle and a distinct caudal needle at the postero-dorsal angle. the surface has a well-developed sculpture, with patterns varying among individuals . in contrast, the smaller ephippia have acute antero-dorsal and postero-dorsal angles lacking a caudal needle and surface sculpturing .

daphniidae gen. sp. 1
material examined. 4307/ <dig> .

redescription. length  <dig>  mm. the ephippium is high, with a slightly convex dorsal margin, a widely rounded anterior margin and a triangular posterior margin . the entire surface is covered with dorso-ventral striation. the axis of a single egg is located parallel to the dorsal margin, and the egg chamber occupies about half of the ephippium length.

comments. this ephippium was named "of moina-type" by smirnov  <cit> , but the generic determination is uncertain. most probably, this is a daphniid ephippium, but a very primitive one. recent species of moina have ephippia with well-developed sculpture of different types  <cit> . in contrast, the ephippium from fragment 4307/ <dig> is only striated. other daphniids, namely ceriodaphnia and some species of daphnia   lay monoegged ephippia . so, the generic position of this ephippium is unclear.

simocephalus sp
material examined. 4307/ <dig> ; 4307/ <dig> .

redescription. the ephippium is elongated, with a straight dorsal margin, a widely rounded anterior margin and a fluently narrowing posterior portion. the surface is finely reticulated . the axis of a single, elongated egg is located parallel to the dorsal margin. the egg chamber occupies more than 2/ <dig> of ephippium length. length:  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm.

comments. the ephippium from fragment 4307/ <dig> was justifiably named "of simocephalus-type" by smirnov  <cit> , indeed, it is quite similar to the ephippia of recent species from this genus . among daphniids, the ephippium of simocephalus is quite unique in possessing a fluently narrowing posterior portion and a large, elongated resting egg  <cit> . although ephippia of recent species normally have well-developed sculpturing, weak sculpturing of the mesozoic ephippia could be an artefact of impression fossil formation or of among-species variation.

discussion
our finding of ephippia from the khotont site that are morphologically similar to the common subgenera of daphnia, d.  and d. , indicates that these two subgenera potentially existed at the j-k boundary . our results also confirm the finding of smirnov  <cit>  that additional daphniid genera  are present at this boundary. the fossils of khotont likely extend the fossil record of the subgeneric divergence of daphnia by about  <dig> my.

the detection of the subgenus ctenodaphnia in the northern hemisphere during the j-k boundary poses a problem for the hypothesis of vicariance by the break up of the supercontinent pangaea. the continental breakup had occurred by  <dig> mya forming laurasia and gondwana, but the two lineages apparently co-occurred far from the presumed dispersal barrier in northern laurasia by about  <dig> mya. under the "out of gondwanaland" requirement for the current vicariance hypothesis, the subgenus ctenodaphnia would have had to breach a more severe oceanic dispersal barrier than contributed to initial speciation, and colonize the most distant continent from gondwanaland. this requires the unlikely transcontinental dispersal before the major dispersal vector of daphniids  had evolved. instead, the current fossil and phylogenetic evidence indicates that the break up of pangaea is not associated with the origins of the main subgenera of daphnia. ctenodaphnia and daphnia appear to have had a presence in laurasia since the early mesozoic . ctenodaphnia are known from throughout much of the present northern hemisphere and one of the northern endemics, daphnia ephemeralis, is likely the oldest known member of the ctenodaphnia, with a basal position in the ctenodaphnia phylogeny. d. ephemeralis also has a primitive morphology for the subgenus with the female having:  a very thick, almost rounded body;  no caudal needle in adults;  a rounded fornix;  a weakly developed rostrum; and  no posterior mid-line depression on the head shield and, as a result, a w-shape of the dorsocephalic suture . ctenodaphnia fossils have been found from the pliocene of nevada, usa, the miocene of spain, the pliocene, oligocene and eocene of china, the eocene of germany, and here from the mesozoic of mongolia . no fossil ctenodaphnia species are yet known from former gondwanaland. although the geographic distribution of known fossils and "basal" species appears inconsistent with gondwanaland origins for ctenodaphnia, the role of extinction and differential fossilization in the formation of these patterns is unknown. it is clear that the age of our new fossils together with existing fossil evidence makes the hypothesis of pangaea-related vicariance less likely.

our results provide a case where both molecular dating  and current biogeography appear to have been misleading regarding the timescale of evolution. haag et al.  <cit>  discuss potential reasons  for discrepancies between their ndna dating and the existing mtdna clock estimates . the dominance of the southern hemisphere by the ctenodaphnia when most daphnia appear capable of among-continent dispersal remains a mystery. presently, species of daphnia s. str. prefer large lakes, while members of d.  occur most often in small temporary water bodies . if this preference evolved early in the differentiation of the subgenera, the greater preference for non-lacustrine and temporary habitats in the ctenodaphnia compared to daphnia combined with priority effects are plausible explanations for the differential success of ctenodaphnia in the southern hemisphere . in the large mesozoic lake khotont both subgenera were found together. but this finding does not mean that they cooccurred in a stable fashion. we cannot rule out the possibility that ephippia were introduced from the surrounding  lentic water bodies during some high water periods, or by some lotic waters. most commonly, the contents of such small water bodies are not fossilised -- we have palaeontological information from cladocerans largely from lakes.

we assumed that ephippial characters that represent subgenera of extant species also reflect the same subgenera in mesozoic taxa. however, it is plausible that ephippial characters from extant subgenera are non-diagnostic in mesozoic taxa. a scenario of independent origins for ephippial characters or ancestral polymorphisms might result in mesozoic ephippia being uninformative for subgeneric reconstruction. however, the multiple origins of characters requires more evolutionary steps than character stability, and the ancestral polymorphisms scenario requires presumably independent diagnostic characters  to sort together. ideally, more characters will be found from mesozoic fossils of daphnia that might address the hypothesis of evolutionary stability for diagnostic ephippial characters. numerous cladocerans lacking an ephippium are reported for the same locality, namely, extinct prochydorids of three different species  <cit>  and a single antenna ii of an undetermined ctenopod  <cit> . however, no complete adult or body part beyond ephippia is known from the daphniids of khotont. the fact of poor preservation of daphniids compared to other cladocerans in bottom deposits is well-known  <cit> . recently richter and baszio  <cit>  demonstrated that the fine structure of eocene daphniids, including limb structure, could be studied from fish coprolites -- a type of fossil that is presently unknown from the khotont. it seems clear that impression fossils yield well-preserved ephippia, but intact daphniid specimens will probably be best sought in fish coprolites from mesozoic localities.

remarkably, daphniids in lake khotont were found together with numerous  fossils of the dipteran  predator of daphniids  <cit> . our results provide evidence that the phenotypic array of inducible defenses in daphnia is more than a rapidly evolved response to predation. this important predator-prey group has been coevolving in freshwater for at least  <dig> my. we expect that the antiquity of daphniidchaoborid coevolution will be reflected in both predator and host genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate that the main subgenera of daphnia could be much older than previously known from fossils  or from nuclear dna estimates of divergence. however, the results showing co-occurrence of the main subgenera far from the presumed laurasia/gondwanaland dispersal barrier shortly after formation suggests that vicariance from the breakup of pangaea is an unlikely explanation for the origin of the main subgenera. the fossil impressions also reveal that the coevolution of a dipteran  predator with the subgenus daphnia has been occurring much longer than previously known -- since the mesozoic.
