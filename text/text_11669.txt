BACKGROUND
the question how adult organisms maintain their tissue homeostasis or perform wound healing and regeneration after injury touches different biological and medical research areas. the two main invertebrate model organisms, drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans are largely post-mitotic and therefore cannot serve as model systems for tissue renewal nor for the biology of somatic stem cells. vertebrate stem cell systems have been addressed because of their medical relevance, but the accessibility of these stem cell systems is limited. flatworms are well known for their remarkable totipotent stem cell system. these stem cells  are the sole source for cell renewal during homeostasis, development and regeneration  <cit> , and give rise to all cell types including germ cells  <cit> . a basal member of the platyhelminthes - the acoela - became separated from other flatworms  <cit>  by molecular phylogeny and were placed as a sistergroup to all bilateria  <cit> , associated with the deuterostomes  <cit>  or located within the lophotrochozoa  <cit> . already  <dig> years ago, the question whether acoel flatworms are "kingpins of metazoan evolution or specialized offshoot"  <cit>  has been raised by summarizing data of a century of morphological analyses where acoelomorpha have been associated to the phylum platyhelminthes  <cit> . by contrast, recent data on the distribution and proliferation of stem cells and the specific mode of epidermal replacement could constitute for a possible synapomorphy between the acoela and the major group of flatworms, the rhabditophora  <cit> . like rhabditophoran flatworms, certain acoels exhibit tremendous capacity to regenerate lost body parts  <cit>  or show modes of asexual reproduction such as reverse-polarity budding  <cit> .

despite the growing interest in acoel phylogeny, knowledge on the developmental biology of this taxon is limited. few reports described the embryonic muscle development  <cit> , the characteristic spiral duet cleavage  <cit> , while others examined their stem cell system and showed that acoels possess also neoblasts which resemble stem cells of rhabditophoran flatworms  <cit> . however, very little is known on the cellular and molecular basis that is driving homeostasis, asexual reproduction and regeneration in these organisms. research on acoels has been hampered by the availability of an acoel species that can be cultured and used as a suitable model system. here we present the acoel isodiametra pulchra  as an adequate species to address developmental and evolutionary questions. i. pulchra has several advantages to perform these analyses:  long term laboratory cultures can be maintained,  the animals are small in size ,  reproduce rapidly ,  have a very short embryonic development   <cit> ,  a short generation time ,   <dig>  ests have been sequenced , and  in situ hybridization and rna interference protocols are established .

the last decennia, the stem cell system of flatworms has been characterized on a molecular level  <cit> . some of the well characterized stem cell regulatory genes in flatworms belong to the piwi-like gene family  <cit> . in most organisms studied so far, piwi is a germline specific marker, essential in spermatogenesis, meiosis and germ cell maintenance where it is involved in transposon regulation  <cit> . an exception herein are rhabditophoran flatworms, sponges and cnidarians where piwi-like genes have been shown to play an extended role in somatic stem cells  <cit> .

here we show that in i. pulchra, piwi is also expressed in a subpopulation of somatic neoblasts. next, we report on the morphology of stem cells, their distribution and differentiation capacity in this acoel species. furthermore, we studied the function of the stem cell system during homeostasis, development, regeneration, hydroxyurea treatment, starvation and after irradiation using histology, electron microscopy, brdu labelling, in situ hybridization and rna interference. to summarize, these data provide new insides how stem cell systems might have been developed during animal evolution.

RESULTS
morphology, distribution, and differentiation of stem cells in isodiametra pulchra
in order to describe the stem cell system of acoels, we first addressed the morphology of isodiametra pulchra  neoblasts. they are small in size and possess a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with only a thin rim of cytoplasm . the nucleus consists of mostly uncondensed chromatin with few smaller clumps of condensed chromatin . when animals were macerated into a single cell suspension after a  <dig> min brdu pulse, only cells with a neoblast morphology were labelled  . on ultrastructural level, all cells that incorporated brdu were small in size and possessed a thin rim of cytoplasm . these data suggest that neoblasts were the only dividing cells.

we next addressed the distribution of somatic stem cells in adults. brdu labelling and ultrastructural analyses revealed a solely parenchymal distribution of s-phase cells . the majority of stem cells were located along the lateral sides of the animal, fewer cells were present also closer to the midline . anterior to the statocyst, proliferating cells were almost completely absent. notably, proliferating cells were never found in the epidermis of brdu labelled animals  . these observations were further confirmed by ultrastructural investigations . our data indicate that all epidermal cells were exclusively renewed from parenchymally located neoblasts.

we further followed the differentiation potential of brdu labelled stem cells  in i. pulchra. brdu pulse-chase experiments  revealed the differentiation of neoblasts into various cell types after a  <dig> days chase period . as mentioned above, all brdu labelled cells exhibited a stem cell phenotype after  <dig> min brdu exposure. after  <dig> days chasing time however, only  <dig> % of labelled cells possessed stem cell morphology  while  <dig> % possessed a differentiated cell phenotype .

ipiwi <dig> expression in adults, during regeneration and during development
next, we analyzed the expression dynamics of piwi-like genes in isodiametra pulchra in adults, during development, regeneration, starvation and after irradiation. from i. pulchra, we have isolated two piwi-like genes, ipiwi <dig> and ipiwi <dig> , both comprising the conserved piwi and paz domains , which are characteristic for members of the piwi/ago family  <cit> . comparable to most organisms studied so far, ipiwi <dig> appeared to have a germ line specific expression . interestingly, ipiwi <dig> showed in addition to the germ line, an expression pattern extended to somatic stem cells , a situation only known from rhabditophoran flatworms, sponges and cnidarians  <cit> . therefore we focussed in this study on ipiwi <dig>  to localize ipiwi <dig> protein, we have generated a specific polyclonal antibody .

in adult animals, ipiwi <dig> mrna and protein were localized in a subpopulation of somatic stem cells and gonads  while the sense probe did not show any signal . ipiwi <dig> positive cells in testes comprised two bands on the lateral sides of the animal which consisted of spermatogonia and spermatocytes . all stages of female germ cells expressed ipiwi <dig> including oogonia, oocytes and mature eggs . we further localized ipiwi <dig> mrna expression in neoblasts in the region posterior to the statocyst but not in the posterior end of the animal . in contrast, few ipiwi <dig> protein positive cells were also found anterior to the statocyst  and in the tail region . these data suggest that ipiwi <dig> protein functions also in differentiating neoblasts, a situation similar to triclad flatworms  <cit> . double labelling of ipiwi <dig> with brdu revealed ipiwi1-only labelled cells, brdu-only labelled cells as well as ipiwi1/brdu double labelled stem cells . these data suggest that ipiwi <dig> was restricted to only a subpopulation of neoblasts.

the process of regeneration in acoel flatworms was earlier examined on both morphological and immunohistochemical level but no molecular analyses have been performed to date  <cit> . here we show ipiwi <dig> expression dynamics during successive stages of tail regeneration  . one hour after initial amputation, ipiwi <dig> could not be detected at the regeneration site .  <dig> hours postamputation however, a small rim of ipiwi <dig> positive cells became visible below the epidermis . at  <dig> hours after amputation, ipiwi <dig> was upregulated within the small blastema . from  <dig> to  <dig> hours of regeneration, ipiwi <dig> expression was detected in neoblasts that were organized in a ring-shaped structure  and outlining the subsequent developing reproductive organs. ipiwi <dig> expression was upregulated only locally within the regeneration blastema but not in anterior regions of the animals . as regeneration proceeded, blastemal cell differentiation was paralleled by a gradual decrease in ipiwi <dig> expression .

we next examined the expression of ipiwi <dig> throughout different stages of postembryonic development . in freshly hatched i. pulchra, small parenchymally located somatic neoblasts and several larger ipiwi <dig> positive primordial germ cells were present in the central region of the animal . those larger ipiwi <dig> positive cells gave rise to testes and ovaries and we confirmed the nature of these cells by double-labelling with an i. pulchra specific nanos probe . the presence of primordial germ cells in freshly hatched i. pulchra suggested an embryonic segregation of the germ line in this species. the number of ipiwi <dig> positive cells increased up to four days post hatching  and distinct ipiwi <dig> stained testes were present after one week . chains of developing eggs could be discerned after  <dig> days of postembryonic development . the number of ipiwi <dig> expressing somatic stem cells gradually increased during postembryonic development. a ring shaped structure of ipiwi <dig> positive cells accounted for the genital blastema , a structure identical to the differentiating genital blastema after  <dig> hours to  <dig> hours of regeneration . the critical role of neoblasts became apparent by treatment with ipiwi <dig> dsrna during development. the functional knock-down of ipiwi <dig> in developing worms resulted in a lethal phenotype .

manipulation of the acoel stem cell system by hydroxyurea, radiation, and starvation
the inhibition of dna-synthesis by hydroxyurea  leads to an arrest of proliferating cells in the s-phase of the cell cycle and a pause of cell cycle progression  <cit>  by inhibition of the ribonucleotide reductase  <cit> . we have applied hydroxyurea treatment for  <dig> days to halt the cell proliferation of stem cells and germ cells. after three to five days of hu treatment ipiwi <dig> expression of neoblasts was abolished and the number of somatic s-phase cells was drastically reduced . after  <dig> days, ipiwi <dig> expression persisted only in mature eggs and no ipiwi <dig> expression could be detected in the region of the testes . these results indicated that germ cell proliferation was interrupted but differentiation of oogonia was still possible. moreover, the faster cell turnover in the testes resulted in an earlier reduction of ipiwi <dig> expressing cells . after  <dig> days of hu treatment ipiwi <dig> expression and cell proliferation of somatic stem cells were completely eradicated . the decrease in cell proliferation in the ovaries became apparent by the reduction in the production of eggs. controls produced the following average number of eggs per animal per day:  <dig>  at the start of the experiment,  <dig>  after three days,  <dig>  after five days,  <dig>  after  <dig> days,  <dig>  after  <dig> days . in the hu treatment group egg numbers decreased from  <dig>  at the start of the experiment to  <dig>  after three days,  <dig>  after five days,  <dig>  after  <dig> days, and no eggs were laid anymore after  <dig> days hu treatment. these data demonstrate that we can use hu to manipulate and study stem cell- and germ cell development in i. pulchra.

radiation is a widely used method in flatworm research to selectively destroy the stem cell system, which in turn stops maintenance of physiological homeostasis, cell renewal and regenerative capability  <cit> . in order to study the effect of irradiation on stem cell gene expression in acoels, we performed irradiation experiments with i. pulchra. we found that ipiwi <dig> expression was completely abolished one and seven days after irradiation, while the expression of the housekeeping gene ipefα  persisted . furthermore, neoblast proliferation was drastically reduced one day and one week after irradiation . these results confirmed that in i. pulchra neoblasts can be eliminated by irradiation. notably, few cells were still detectable by brdu incorporation at one day  and one week  postradiation. it is possible that certain cells conduct intensified dna repair which could lead to the incorporation of brdu  <cit> . another possibility is that certain stem cells were in a less radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle during radiation and started to divide and to incorporate brdu. however, our results suggest that neither dna repair nor the presence of radio resistant stem cells were able to reconstitute the entire stem cell population since irradiation led to death of the animals.

to date, nothing is known of the effect of starvation on the stem cell system of acoels. for this reason, we examined the expression dynamics of ipiwi <dig> during starvation in i. pulchra . after prolonged starvation the number of ipiwi <dig> positive cells was diminished, animals were drastically reduced in size and completely devoid of reproductive organs on morphological level. in i. pulchra, small ipiwi <dig> positive germ cells remained even after several weeks of starvation . after refeeding, animals regrew again to adult stage within one month. these results suggest that degrowth of the animals, the reduction of reproductive organs, and the plasticity of the stem cell system during starvation is a feature how i. pulchra deals with food deprivation.

ipiwi <dig> rna interference in adults, during regeneration and during development
in order to examine the function of piwi-like genes in isodiametra pulchra, we applied rna interference in adults, during development and regeneration. we examined the effect of the loss of ipiwi <dig> mrna and protein by whole mount in situ hybridization of ipiwi <dig>  the expression of the vasa-like gene ipvasa, by ipiwi <dig> protein localization, and by brdu labelling after  <dig> and  <dig> days of ipiwi <dig> dsrna application. we confirmed the specificity of ipiwi <dig> and ipiwi <dig> dsrna probes for silencing their respective target .

in adults, luciferase dsrna was applied as control and no noticeable mock effects were observed regarding ipiwi <dig> expression, brdu incorporation and animal morphology . in contrast, ipiwi <dig> rnai treatment led to an elimination of ipiwi <dig> mrna and protein after seven and  <dig> days . ipiwi <dig> rnai resulted in a subsequent reduction in ipvasa expression after three weeks of treatment . remarkably, ipiwi <dig> knock-down had at that time no apparent effect on stem cell proliferation and the phenotype of the animals .

a comparable role of ipiwi <dig> was observed during regeneration . animals were cut twice - at one and two weeks of ipiwi <dig> rnai treatment respectively - and were analyzed after  <dig> days, i.e. seven days after the final amputation. ipiwi <dig> dsrna treated regenerates lacked ipiwi <dig> mrna and protein , had reduced ipvasa expression , but preserved normal cell proliferation , and were able to rebuild the missing body parts. however, these animals were unable to produce viable offspring. taken together, these results suggest that ipiwi <dig> is not involved - fulfils a redundant function - in the regulation of stem cell maintenance in adult and regenerating animals, but is crucial for offspring development.

finally, we wanted to address whether ipiwi <dig> had an essential function during development of i. pulchra. therefore we eliminated ipiwi <dig> already in developing eggs of adult worms to abolish maternal ipiwi <dig> mrna. as such, the term development used here includes all stages from a maturating egg within an adult, to embryonic and postembryonic stages. eggs from adult worms, which were treated with ipiwi <dig> dsrna for two weeks died without hatching. embryos collected from one week ipiwi <dig> dsrna treated adults hatched, but had abrogated ipiwi <dig> mrna  and ipiwi <dig> protein . they also did not retain ipvasa expression , completely lacked proliferating cells , and juveniles died within the first week of postembryonic development. these data suggest that ipiwi <dig> has an essential function during development.

discussion
acoels possess a potent stem cell system that is responsible for development, homeostasis, growth and regeneration
in recent years it has been shown that flatworms can serve as suitable model systems for understanding basis mechanisms of stem cell biology, regeneration, and aging  <cit> . here we characterized the stem cell system of the acoel isodiametra pulchra and clearly illustrated that i. pulchra possesses neoblast-like proliferating cells, earlier also described for the acoels convolutriloba longifissura and convoluta naikaiensis  <cit> . epidermal cells as well as all other cell types from the three germ layers were exclusively renewed from these mesodermally located stem cells. a similar mode of tissue homeostasis and epidermal replacement is known from rhabditophoran platyhelminthes such as macrostomids  <cit> , triclads  <cit>  and neodermata  <cit> . within the bilateria, a stem cell population crucial for development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration is hitherto only known from acoela and rhabditophora. in the cnidarian hydra, i-cells serve as stem cells for most tissues, whereas two epithelial cell lineages guarantee for epithelial tissue homeostasis  <cit> . likewise, in other taxa with high regeneration capacity such as sponges  <cit> , several stem cell populations ensure tissue specific homeostasis.

in basal metazoan taxa with high regeneration and transdifferentiation capacity such as sponges and cnidarians, piwi-like genes play a role in the regulation of gonadal and somatic stem cells  <cit> . notably, studies on the expression of piwi-like genes of key positioned taxa such as catenulids, nemertodermatids, gnathostomulids, gastrotrichs are lacking. here we showed that in the adult i. pulchra ipiwi <dig> is expressed in a subpopulation of somatic stem cells and in germ cells. regarding the crucial phylogenetic position of acoels, our data give evidence that piwi expression extended to somatic stem cells might have persisted from basal bilateria to higher organisms including ascidians and human blood cells  <cit> .

since i. pulchra is not able to regenerate a new head, we focussed in the current study on posterior regeneration. during the first days, ipiwi <dig> expression was locally upregulated underneath the wound epithelia. as regeneration proceeded, differentiation of the tissue was paralleled by decrease of piwi expression. notably there was an apparent similarity between piwi expression dynamics during formation of the genital organs during development and regeneration. such a local piwi upregulation was also found during regeneration in triclads  <cit> , as well as during regeneration and development in macrostomum lignano  <cit> .

during the development of animals with sexual reproduction, a biological decision has to be made to separate soma  from the germline . however, in some phyla, such as sponges, cnidarians, acoels and rhabditophoran flatworms, the border between those two lineages is not clearly made and germ cells can be formed de novo from somatic stem cells . here we show that in the acoel i. pulchra, germ cell precursors are already present in freshly hatched worms, suggesting an embryonic formation of the germline. although in flatworms it was initially supposed that the germline is formed postembryonically  <cit> , several publications recently showed the presence of germ cells in late embryos or freshly hatched worms  <cit> . however, despite the fact that germ cells might be already present in late embryos of i. pulchra and some rhabditophoran flatworms they maintain somatic neoblasts during adulthood which retain the capacity to differentiate into germ cells  <cit> .

ipiwi <dig> expression dynamics following stem cell depletion by hu treatment, irradiation and starvation
in i. pulchra, prolonged hu treatment resulted in a drastic decline in stem cell proliferation and ipiwi <dig> expression. the faster elimination of ipiwi <dig> expression and brdu in somatic stem cells and testes, compared to ovaries could be explained by the faster cell turnover in these tissues  <cit> . notably, after  <dig> days of hu treatment, few cells were still able to incorporate brdu. these cells might be gonadal cells or slow cycling neoblasts, activated upon stem cell depletion  <cit> . in triclad flatworms hydroxyurea was applied to detect fast and slow cycling neoblasts  <cit> . in the parasitic platyhelminth schistosoma mansoni it was found that both sexes were sensitive to hydroxyurea treatment  <cit> . interestingly, it was shown that hydroxyurea had no effect on metamorphosis of miracidia  <cit> . in the cnidarian hydra hu was used to reduce the number of interstitial cells  <cit>  and to follow nerve cell and nematocyte differentiation  <cit> . to conclude, our data demonstrate that we can use hu to manipulate and study stem cell- and germ cell development in i. pulchra.

since neoblasts are the only proliferating cells in rhabditophoran flatworms, radiation is a commonly used method to confirm stem cell specific gene expression  <cit> . in this study, we showed that a similar situation was observed after depleting the stem cell population of acoels by radiation. radiation drastically reduced the expression of ipiwi <dig>  confirming his stem cell specific expression. one week post radiation, few cells were still able to incorporate brdu. further experiments will reveal if these cells are activated slow cycling neoblasts or gonadal stem cells which were shown to possess higher radio tolerance in rhabditophoran flatworms  <cit> .

food deprivation resulted in degrowth of i. pulchra. during prolonged starvation, animals successively decreased in body size, possessed reduced gonads, and showed a diminished proliferation activity. after refeeding however, animals regrew again to adult size. comparably, some annelids  <cit> , nemerteans  <cit>  and rhabditophoran flatworms  <cit>  are able to starve for months and undergo degrowth during that period. the terrestrial triclad arthurdendyus triangulatus undergoes natural periods of growth and degrowth correlated with the availability of its prey - the earthworm  <cit> . upon starvation, adult animals resorb their tissues and deplete body reserves  <cit>  and cannot be distinguished from juvenile animals  <cit> . the striking cellular responses of freshwater triclads to degrowth include the reduction of cell proliferation, a decrease in cell numbers, and autophagy  <cit> . similar observations of growth and degrowth were found in the macrostomid flatworm m. lignano  <cit> . we conclude that degrowth, and the reduction of reproductive organs are features how i. pulchra deals with food deprivation.

ipiwi <dig> function is essential for acoel development
in order to analyse the function of piwi-like genes in acoels, we established a non-invasive rnai protocol by soaking. ipiwi <dig> rna interference during development resulted in a lethal phenotype, demonstrating the crucial role of ipiwi <dig> during development. although ipiwi <dig> is expressed in a subpopulation of somatic stem cells and in germ cells no visible phenotype could be observed after prolonged rnai treatment regarding homeostasis and regeneration. the absence of a clear phenotype could be explained by the fact that other piwi-like genes might compensate for ipiwi <dig> function. at the moment, we cannot exclude this possibility since the genome of i. pulchra is not yet available and screening with several different degenerated primers did not result in the isolation of additional piwi-like genes. we can exclude a redundancy with ipiwi <dig> since ipiwi1/ipiwi <dig> double rnai did not lead to a more severe phenotype .

although redundant piwi-like genes might exist in i. pulchra, it is intriguing that redundancy would act during homeostasis and regeneration, but not during development. these observations indicate that stem cells might be differentially regulated and expression of different piwi-like genes might vary during development and homeostasis  <cit> . further characterization of all piwi-like genes might clarify if we deal with different stem cell populations or if stem cells are differentially regulated.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we presented the acoel isodiametra pulchra as suitable model organism to address developmental questions in this understudied phylum. we established stable laboratory cultures of i. pulchra with unlimited availability of offspring the whole year through, and developed a whole mount ish protocol and a simplified rnai method by soaking.

summarizing all data we can conclude that  acoel neoblasts are the only proliferating cells in isodiametra pulchra,  acoel stem cells show a characteristic morphology on the light and electron microscopical level,  neoblasts are exclusively located parenchymally with a lack of proliferating cells in the epidermis,  cell renewal for tissue homeostasis, during growth and regeneration is based exclusively on parenchymal stem cells,  piwi expression in i. pulchra is, in addition to the germline, present in a subpopulation of somatic neoblasts,  i. pulchra exhibits a high plasticity upon starvation accompanied by substantial degrowth and the reduction of reproductive organs. refeeding leads to a full restoration of size and reproduction,  irradiation leads to the elimination of neoblasts and finally to the death of the animals,  functional knock-down of ipiwi <dig> reveals an essential role of ipiwi <dig> during development.
