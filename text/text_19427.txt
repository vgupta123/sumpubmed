BACKGROUND
enteroinvasive escherichia coli  is a diarrheagenic e. coli  pathotype that shares its pathogenic behavior with shigella so that they have been considered a unique pathovar  <cit> . like the other dec pathotypes eiec infections occur by the fecal-oral route, and usually are more prominent in low-income regions due to poor sanitation . nevertheless, outbreaks associated with contaminated food and water can occur among high-income people groups as well .

the pathogenicity of eiec/shigella is dependent on genetic virulence determinants coded by genes frequently located in pathogenicity-associated islands  usually dispersed both on the chromosome and in the invasion plasmid , present in all virulent eiec strains .

compared to other dec, eiec is referred as a rare etiological agent of endemic diarrhea while shigella is estimated to cause millions of cases annually worldwide, with a mortality rate that can reach 1% among children groups  <cit> . this discrepancy may be due to the absence of simple laboratory methods to differentiate eiec from shigella since both shares almost all the characteristics used in their identification. with all these common features, it is plausible that misidentification occurs, and many of those million shigella cases may be in fact caused by eiec.

the use of modern approaches like multilocus enzyme electrophoresis , multilocus sequence typing , and comparative genomics  is bringing new comprehension to the phylogenetic origin and evolution of the pathogenic and commensal lifestyles of the microorganisms in general. clermont et al.  <cit>  have developed a simple multiplex pcr method which has allowed assessing the phylogenetic origin of great numbers of e. coli isolates in epidemiological surveys all over the world. a further improved method based on the genotype of genes arpa, chua, yjaa and tspe <dig> c <dig> was able to correctly assign more than 95% of e. coli strains into eight phylogroups   <cit> .

studies using these various approaches have confirmed that e. coli have a clonal structure  <cit>  and that non-pathogenic strains differ from diarrheagenic e. coli , and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  in respect to their phylogenetic origin. there is common sense that both dec and expec have evolved in expenses of blocks of genes acquisition by strains with a permissive phylogenetic background. those gene blocks, generally originated from non-related microorganisms, were moved to e. coli via horizontal gene transfer mechanisms mediated by mobile genetic elements such as pais, plasmids, and bacteriophages. after all, the set of foreign genes has established in specific genetic backgrounds given rise to different e. coli pathovars with eiec being one of them.

while there is an extensive literature covering the details of shigella genetic virulence determinants, these aspects have been poorly exploited in eiec. the recent occurrence of two important outbreaks in europe due to an eiec strain  <cit>  has motivated studies on the molecular characterization and comparative genomics of eiec strains isolated in various geographic regions to better understand the evolution of this e. coli pathovar  <cit> . however, a possible way of eiec rearrangements driven by the acquisition of mobile genetic elements engaged in virulence of other e. coli pathovars has not been addressed yet. that could explain the appearance of eiec strains presenting higher virulence potential.

in this work, we examined a comprehensive set of eiec strains encompassing most of the frequently isolated serogroups to assess their phylogenetic origin as well as carriage of virulence genes  and pais genetic markers considered to be involved in expec pathogenicity. we have found that eiec strains are distributed in various phylogroups in a serogroup-dependent manner. besides, they may harbor several vgs and genetic pai markers usually associated with uropathogenic e. coli . the simultaneous carriage of extra-intestinal and diarrheagenic virulence traits by eiec could play a role in their evolution towards hypervirulent clones. such a possibility may turn out to be a matter of public health concern and deserves further investigation.

RESULTS
serogroup confirmation
the studied strains encompassed nine of the most frequently isolated eiec serogroups as follows: o28ac , o <dig> , o <dig> and o <dig> , o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> , and o <dig>  .table  <dig> main biochemical characteristics of eiec according to serogroup and phylogroup

eiec main biochemical characteristics
as is usual for eiec, all strains did not decarboxylate lysine and were non-motile, exception done to two o <dig> strains exhibiting flagellar type h <dig>  typical e. coli biochemical behavior in respect to lactose fermentation and indole production was serogroup-related, and uniformly observed for o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  but not for o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> which did not ferment lactose. all o <dig>  one o28ac, and most o <dig> and o <dig> strains did not produce indole. serogroup o <dig> was the only variable regarding lactose fermentation  .

presence of invasion plasmids
all strains presented a variable number of plasmid bands, but all of them possessed a high molecular weight  dna-band ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb compatible with the mw described for invasion plasmids   <cit> .

invasive phenotype
all strains were able to invade hela cells in the gentamicin protection assay, confirming the invasive phenotype and showing the stability of the genes necessary for cell culture invasion even after long periods of storage.

determination of phylogenetic origin
by using the quadruplex pcr method  <cit> , eiec strains were distributed within five of the eight phylogenetic groups, with all strains in a given group presenting a uniform quadruplex  genotype. the frequency of phylogroups and their quadruplex genotypes were: 49% from phylogroup a , 29% from phylogroup e , 18% from phylogroup b <dig> . groups c  and b <dig>  were represented by one strain each. it is worth mentioning that all but two serogroups were strictly distributed in a given phylogroup as follows: strains from serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> were from phylogroup a, while o28ac and o <dig> were from phylogroup b <dig>  and o <dig> from phylogroup e. serogroup o <dig> strains were most originated from phylogroup e  with only one strain typed as group a. a broad divergence was found only in serogroup o <dig> that was dispersed in phylogroups a, b <dig>  b <dig>  and c  .

presence of expec virulence markers
as many as  <dig> out of  <dig> searched expec vgs were found in eiec strains in this survey. the most frequent were ompa , trat , and sita . four vgs were present less frequently, namely: iha , irp <dig> , chua , and fima . the remaining four vgs were rarely found: kpsmtii , hra, vat, and ompt  . none eiec strain presented vgs papa/c, sfade, afabciii, cvac, iucd, iron, sat, and α-hlya. table  <dig> shows the genetic virulence profile found among the eiec serogroups according to their phylogenetic origin. serogroups o <dig> and o <dig> were uniform in their virulence profile. nevertheless, all other serogroups, except for o <dig>  presented a predominant set of vgs of their own, encompassing 67% to 80% of the strains in each serogroup. the absence of sita and iha was responsible for the diversity observed in three of those serogroups  .table  <dig> genetic virulence profile of eiec according to phylogroup and serogroup

discussion
eiec is known to be restricted to a dozen serogroups  <cit> , all non-motile with very rare exceptions  <cit> . however, it has been demonstrated by molecular methods that non-motile eiec strains present the genes for flagella  <cit> . although necessary for epidemiological assessment, molecular methods are not feasible in clinical laboratory settings in less developed geographical areas where negative tests for motility and lysine decarboxylation continue to be important phenotypic clues to direct the diagnosis of eiec. it was interesting to note that biochemical behavior regarding lactose fermentation and indole production was phylogroup-related. the lack of indole production, although rarely reported among e. coli isolates  <cit> , was frequently found among eiec, remarkably associated to serogroups o <dig> and o <dig> 

it has been accepted that diarrheagenic e. coli pathotypes are primordially originated from phylogenetic groups a, and b <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, prototype strains from important dec pathovars are assigned to more virulent phylogroups as happens with epec strain e <dig>  and ehec strain edl <dig>  which are originated from phylogroups b <dig> and e, respectively  <cit> .

we have shown that eiec strains analyzed in this study, do not have a unique phylogenetic origin. instead, they have arisen most  from phylogroups a, and e, while b <dig> origin was less common . moreover, the phylogenetic distribution showed to be strictly related to serogroup, since all o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> strains were assigned to phylogroup a, all o28ac, and o <dig> were b <dig>  and all o <dig> and the majority of o <dig> were group e. serogroup o <dig> was unique in presenting a flexible phylogenetic distribution, with strains spread in phylogroups a, b <dig>  c, and b <dig>  by using various molecular approaches, several authors have also shown the distribution of eiec in different clusters  <cit> , or phylogroups  <cit> . in agreement with our results, hazen et al.  <cit> , using in silico analysis of complete genome sequences, showed that serogroup o <dig> was classified in phylogroup a, and o <dig> in phylogroup e. however, our results were discrepant from those authors in respect to serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> that they assigned to group b <dig>  one reason for this inconsistency might be the small number of strains sequenced in that study. overall, and in accordance with other authors  <cit> , the diversity in phylogenetic origin emphasizes the multiple evolutionary histories of eiec. as mentioned, other dec pathovars have already been demonstrated to exhibit diverse phylogenetic origin but, to our knowledge, the link between phylogeny and serogroup has not been covered in a comprehensive manner hitherto.

although eiec is a diarrheagenic pathotype, it showed to harbor two to seven out of  <dig> searched virulence genetic markers that are associated with virulence of expec  <cit> . the data presented in this study corroborate and further extend the idea that diarrheagenic pathotypes may share expec vgs, and vice-versa . in fact, some of the found vgs herein are widespread in e. coli, regardless the pathogenic potential of the strain.

despite the low number of strains in each serogroup in this study, the presence of those vgs in eiec may not be casual since the majority of strains  presented specific virulence gene profiles for each of eight among nine serogroups studied. further research is needed to understand the contribution of extraintestinal vgs to the pathogenesis of eiec. nonetheless, it is already known that the conjunction of virulence traits from diverse e. coli pathotypes may give rise to extreme virulent clones as have recently happened with e. coli o104:h <dig> which combined enteroaggregative and toxigenic properties  <cit> .

using the same methodology described by sabaté et al.  <cit>  this study detected four out of eight pais primarily described in upec. interestingly, those authors reported 14% of upec missing all these pais, while all eiec strains analyzed herein presented one to four pais. it was remarkable that pai ij <dig> was the most frequent in eiec  while it was not detected in any of the commensal or upec isolates in that study. other authors have also reported the absence or very low frequency of pai ij <dig> in commensal and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli isolates, including upec . island iicft <dig> was detected in 80% of our eiec isolates, and none were from phylogroup b <dig>  while it was found by sabaté  <cit>  only in isolates from phylogroup b <dig>  in agreement with sabaté et al.  <cit> , pai icft <dig> was exclusively detected in eiec strains from phylogroups b <dig> and e. dobrindt et al.  <cit>  reported the presence of pais i <dig> to iv <dig>  or at least some of their dna regions, in diarrheagenic isolates. besides pai iv <dig> no other pais from upec  <dig> were detected in this study. we have shown that eiec also harbors multiple pais as described for upec  <cit> . however, the most predominant combination found in eiec  was not detected in upec  <cit> . except for pai iv <dig> the other three pais detected in this study did not correlate with the presence of the recognized virulence traits they are reported to encode namely: α-hemolysin, p-fimbriae, prs-fimbriae, cytotoxic necrotizing factor  <dig>  and aerobactin  <cit> . the occurrence of dna rearrangements in these pais could explain the missing virulence traits  <cit> , while other yet-unknown regions  <cit>  could be perpetuated in eiec. recently reported a genomic analysis of eiec strains  <cit>  had not mentioned the presence of sequences similar to upec pais although serogroups and phylogroups studied encompassed some of those analyzed herein. a possible explanation may be that those studies have focused only in virulence markers already known to be involved in the pathogenicity of eiec and shigella for the intestinal tract.

while extraintestinal virulence determinants tended to be segregated according to serogroup and phylogroup, the enteroinvasive determinants, either chromosomal or plasmid located, were maintained in all strains in this study, regardless their serogroup or phylogroup. this finding suggests that the enteroinvasive pathotype has evolved later in the eiec evolution as pointed by others  <cit> .

finally, as happens with the finding of expec vgs, the presence of upec pai genetic markers in eiec needs to be further investigated to gain comprehension not only on the pathogenesis but also on the evolution of this important diarrheagenic pathotype.

CONCLUSIONS
eiec is a dec pathovar that presents both vgs and pai genetic markers typically found in expec, especially upec. these features are distributed in a phylogenetic and serogroup-dependent manner suggesting the existence of stable eiec subclones. the constant and uncommon presence of pai ij <dig> suggests a not yet unveiled fact in the eiec evolution which requires special attention. the data herein extends the observations reported in the current literature on the occurrence of heteropathogenic e. coli, meaning those strains that combine vgs specific of different e. coli pathovars.

the occurrence of clones combining virulence genes derived from different e. coli pathovars as a result of horizontal gene transfer could play a previously unsuspected role in the pathogenesis of eiec infections.
