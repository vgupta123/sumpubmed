BACKGROUND
sepsis is a life-threatening condition which results from an exacerbated inflammatory process caused by complex interactions between the innate immune system and either bacterial sources of infection or their circulating antigens, mainly lipopolysaccharides . circulating lps is engaged by toll-like receptor  <dig>  on the surface of monocytes and macrophages, which in turn result in cell activation and early production of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . tumor necrosis factor  plays a key role in sepsis due to its ability to trigger respiratory burst and nitric oxide production while diminishing peripheral vascular resistance, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure  <cit> .

elucidation of pathophysiological events that underlie sepsis has led to the development of molecules targeting these pathways. major strategies to block tnf have included the use of anti-tnf monoclonal antibodies, soluble tnf receptors with igg chimeric protein, and anti-tnf f <dig> fragments  <cit> . interestingly, both the effectiveness and usefulness of each anti-tnf strategy varies among studies, often being conflictive and even contradictory. this could be partly the result of the intensity of tnf blockade as well as the tissue penetration achieved by each type of molecule.

immunoglobulin new antigen receptors  are a unique subset of antibodies found in sharks. it consists of homodimers of polypeptide chains, each comprising a single variable  and five constant  domains. single vnar domains are candidates to be the smallest, naturally occurring, antibody-based immune recognition units  <cit> . moreover, vnar domains have been suggested as a highly effective set of molecules capable to access antigenic sites rarely targeted by conventional antibody-based strategies, positioning them as attractive candidates for therapy  <cit> . thus, we explored the survival of mice in an experimental model of endotoxic shock, after treatment with a vnar single domain directed against tnf.

RESULTS
efficacy of vnar on survival
survival of mice was documented for up to four days after induction of endotoxemia . all animals in the endotoxemic shock group died within 48 h following administration of ld <dig> lps. in contrast, tnf blockade with either vnar domains or f <dig> fragments reduced mortality as early as 24 h and continued until 96 h surveillance. vnar domains were associated with lower mortality compared with f <dig> fragments, although this was not significant , however both groups were significantly protected vs ld <dig> treatment .

inflammatory markers in sera
induction of endotoxic shock produced a significant increase in the serum concentration  of tnf at 3 h after lps administration  in the untreated group , f <dig> group , and vnar group  compared to animals with neither administration of lps nor anti-tnf . nevertheless, f <dig> fragments induced a persistent decrease of tnf at 24 h  and 48h , while vnar domains produced a transitory decrease at 24 h , with a subsequent mild increase at 48 h . endotoxemic shock was also associated with an early raise of il- <dig>  in untreated , treated with anti-tnf f <dig>  and with vnar groups . after 24 h both anti-tnf treatments induced a similar decline in the il- <dig> concentration.

tnf/il- <dig> ratio was considered to represent antagonistic inflammatory responses in endotoxic shock  <cit> . while a predominance of anti-inflammatory response driven by il- <dig> was steadily observed in the f <dig> group from 3 h to 48 h of surveillance, vnar treated animals showed a pro-inflammatory response characterized by high tnf and low il- <dig> serum concentrations.

serum concentrations  of il- <dig> were similar at 3 h in all endotoxemic shock groups  and significantly different to those of normal group . f <dig> group showed a gradual decrement , while this decline was abrupt in the vnar group . il- <dig> levels were undetectable at 48 h in all groups.

nitrites concentration  in sera was found to be elevated at 3h in ld <dig>  and f <dig>   groups vs normal group , but not in vnar group  . while their concentration remained almost unchanged at 24h  in the anti-tnf vnar group, it increased around three-fold in the f <dig> fragments group .

liver mrna quantification
relative mrna expression of tnf and il- <dig> in liver increased at 3 h as a result of lps administration . however while ld <dig> of lps induced a predominant pro-inflammatory response, tnf blockade with either molecule was associated with an anti-inflammatory predominance. however, subtle differences in the tnf/il- <dig> balance were found, because polarization to an anti-inflammatory status was more pronounced in the animals receiving f <dig> fragments than in those with vnar therapy.

interleukin- <dig> gene expression in liver increased early  after lps challenge in all groups . tnf blockade was associated with rapid  and sustained  suppression of il- <dig> mrna expression; however, the intensity was different according to the anti-tnf strategy used. indeed, vnar therapy showed to be more effective than f <dig> to suppress il- <dig> mrna expression at 24 h  and 48 h  after induction of endotoxemia.

finally, expression of mrna inducible-nitric oxide synthase  in liver was similar between all groups at 3 h  ; at 24 h both anti-tnf schemes strikingly decreased inos mrna expression, but only in vnar group this reduction was found to be statistically significant.

discussion
vnar domains are promissory antibody-based molecules because of their particular features such as low molecular weight and size, resistance to gastric ph and long cdr <dig> loop. vnar domains are currently used to neutralize bioactive molecules and viruses  <cit> , as well as to perform in vitro diagnostic assays  <cit> . herein, we present the first study aimed to report an anti-tnf vnar that improves survival in a murine model of endotoxic shock. our results support a role for tnf bioactivity blockade in the treatment of sepsis, and suggest that different anti-tnf strategies may reach different survival rates through differentially attenuating inflammatory mechanisms.

in the present study, anti-tnf administration was not associated with early  depletion of serum tnf levels; on the contrary, tnf was detected in sera from animals in all groups. in contrast, serum tnf declined to almost undetectable levels at 24 h and 48 h after administration of either f <dig> fragments or vnar domains. these results are opposed to others studies showing that treatments with anti-tnf antibodies early reduce serum tnf concentration  <cit> . a possible explanation is based on the molecular weight and bioavailability of each molecule. in this context, while conventional murine monoclonal igg antibodies  have a serum half-life of  <dig> days  <cit> , mean serum half-life of smaller molecules is reduced, possibly as a result of improved clearance. indeed, f <dig> fragments  show a mean serum half-life of  <dig> hrs  <cit> , and vnar  single domains as little as  <dig> min to  <dig>  hrs  <cit> .

the liver plays key physiological roles including blood filtering of toxins as well as inactivation and clearing of bacterial antigens and products  <cit> . thus, the liver is a site in which early inflammatory changes in sepsis can be assessed by measuring the expression of several pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules  <cit> . due to the size of vnar single domains, they may arrive to the liver and, possibly, deeply penetrate in hepatic tissue  <cit> , which ultimately may result in the attenuation of inflammatory response. in our study, untreated animals with endotoxic shock showed an intense pro-inflammatory response featured by high expression of tnf and low expression of il- <dig> in liver, while anti-tnf treated groups were characterized by an anti-inflammatory response featured by high expression of il- <dig> and low expression of tnf.

the protective role of il- <dig> in animal sepsis may be due to its antagonistic effect on the production and overall functioning of tnf  <cit> . in this way, it has been demonstrated that neutralization of il- <dig> in septic animals and the induction of endotoxemic shock in il- <dig> knockout animals are associated with increased tissue injury  <cit>  and higher serum levels of interferon-γ and tnf  <cit> . in our study, a lower anti-inflammatory tnf/il- <dig> ratio was associated with the administration of vnar domains compared to f <dig> fragments. this could be associated with the trend for higher survival observed in the group on vnar therapy. in support to this notion, we have previously described that regulation in the il-1β/il- <dig> balance is associated with protection against lethality in a sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture  <cit> . the presence of similar results in different models of sepsis further supports that modulation of inflammation would tame tissue injury mechanisms, while full blockade of an inflammatory pathway would facilitate polarization of the immune response in either systemic inflammatory response syndrome or its counterpart, compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome  <cit> .

tumor necrosis factor directly influences the production of il- <dig> and inos  <cit>  and it is conceivable that its attenuation could have regulated both gene expression and serum concentration of il- <dig> and nitric oxide  in our experiments. for example, it has been reported that the administration of anti-il- <dig> antibodies improves survival in sepsis  <cit> ; while tnf blockade inhibits hepatic expression of inos and nitrotyrosine in mice with endotoxic shock  <cit> .

in addition, protection of liver seems to be critical to obtain beneficial outcomes in sepsis. in a recent study performed in rats with polymicrobial sepsis, treatment with hyperoncotic albumin attenuates hepatic injury in association with reduced plasma levels of il-1β, il- <dig>  liver enzymes, and o2- concentrations  <cit> . these results support anti-tnf vnar domains as an alternative approach in the treatment of sepsis, due to its attenuating effects on the inflammatory response showed in liver; however these must be further studied in more aggressive models such as the polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture. related to the latter study, a recent rat gut model of indomethacin-induced jejunoileitis showed that anti-tnf-α monoclonal antibody reduced inos expression and il- <dig> beta, the latter two thought to be key mediators of inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
anti-tnf vnar single domains are a novel strategy useful to improve survival in a murine model of endotoxic shock, with efficacy similar to that observed with the use of anti-tnf f <dig> fragments. protection against lethality was associated with regulation in the tnf/il- <dig> inflammatory balance, attenuation of il- <dig> and inos liver expression, and decreased il- <dig> serum concentration.
