BACKGROUND
timing the transition to flowering to synchronise with favourable seasons of the year is critical for successful sexual reproduction in many plants. arabidopsis thaliana  heynh  flowers rapidly in the lengthening days of spring and summer  and shows delayed flowering in short day conditions   <cit> . gigantea  is a key regulator of the photoperiodic response of arabidopsis as plants carrying mutations in this gene no longer flower rapidly in response to ld  <cit> . instead, the gi mutant develops a large rosette of leaves and thus is "gigantic" in size compared to wild type plants before finally flowering. the gi mutant flowers at a similarly delayed time as wild type plants in sd.

since the role of gi in promoting flowering was first highlighted by mutant analysis  <cit> , gi has been shown to have other distinct functions. these include roles in photomorphogenesis and in regulation of the circadian clock, an internal oscillator that regulates daily rhythms of ~ <dig> h in duration  <cit> . a molecular basis for some of the effects of gi on clock function was recently provided  <cit> . gi was shown to interact with an f-box containing blue light receptor zeitlupe  leading to the proteasome-dependant degradation of the central clock component timing of chlorophyll a/b binding protein  <dig>   <cit> .

a module of genes acting in the order gi - constans  - flowering locus t  were shown to promote flowering in ld . these are all rhythmically expressed and regulated by the circadian clock  <cit> . ft encodes a strong promoter of flowering which was recently shown to function as a mobile flowering hormone or "florigen" . after induction of ft transcription, ft protein was produced in the vasculature of the leaves, mobilized in the phloem and uploaded in the shoot apex where it interacted with a bzip transcription factor called fd . this led to activation of genes including the floral integrator suppression of overexpression of co <dig>  in the shoot apex, then floral meristem identity genes such as apetala  <dig>  and the transition from vegetative to floral development . the coincidence of co expression with light in the late afternoon in ld stabilized the co protein resulting in up-regulation of ft in the late afternoon and promotion of flowering . in sd, co was expressed predominantly in the night and co protein was degraded and thus flowering was not promoted .

gi was placed upstream of co in the photoperiod pathway, as co expression was reduced in gi mutants and up-regulated by over expression of gi from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter   <cit> . as expected from the regulatory hierarchy just described, the gi mutant had very low transcript levels of ft  <cit> . how gi might function at the molecular level to promote co expression and flowering was not clear from its amino acid sequence which was predicted to form a large  <dig> aa protein with no domains of known biochemical function such as dna binding  <cit> . gi transcript cycled and accumulated to peak levels ~ <dig> h after dawn with highest protein levels at ~ <dig> h after lights on  in ld  <cit> . co transcript was biphasic with a peak in the late afternoon in ld and a second peak persisting through the night and at dawn then falling to trough levels during much of the day  <cit> . recently, gi and a blue light receptor fkf <dig> , related to ztl, were shown to interact in a light-stimulated fashion and target a repressor of co transcription - cycling dof factor  <dig> - for degradation by the proteasome  <cit> . chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the fkf <dig> and gi proteins interacted in vivo with the co gene promoter supporting a nuclear role for gi in flowering  <cit> .

despite this remarkable progress, important questions remain about the molecular role of gi in promoting the transition to flowering and the other processes that it influences. for example, it is not clear if gi promotes flowering solely through gi-fkf <dig> interactions as 35s::gi constructs accelerate flowering in fkf <dig> mutant plants  <cit>  and co transcript levels are reduced in gi mutants at all time points in both ld and sd  <cit> , not only in the late afternoon in ld when gi and fkf <dig> interact in wild type plants  <cit> .

thus, our overall aim was to use an inducible gi system to ascertain if there were other previously unknown early targets  of gi action that would cast light on the broader roles of gi. the approach chosen was to fuse the ligand binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor  to the c-terminus of gi. this would allow post-translational induction of gi activity by application of the steroid hormone dexamethasone  .

previously, use of a similar post-translational steroid induction system was very productive in the search for early targets of the flowering time regulator co  <cit> . plants carrying a 35s::co-gr transgene flowered earlier than wild type in the presence of dex  <cit>  and  <dig> h of dex treatment increased the expression of co targets such as ft and twin sister of ft   <cit> . furthermore, the increased transcript accumulation occurred in the presence of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. this indicated that translation of other gene products was not needed once dex had been applied and thus that ft and tsf were direct targets of co.

here we report on the characterisation of a steroid-inducible post-translational control system for gi in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
a steroid-inducible gi fusion protein promotes the transition to flowering
we constructed transgenic gi lines to investigate floral induction and gene expression using a post-translationally-inducible gi protein. the transgenic lines  were designed to express a gi protein fusion protein composed of a  <dig> amino acid ligand binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor  fused to the c-terminus of gi in a gi mutant background . the fusion gene was expressed from the constitutive 35s promoter. the transcript and protein product of the 35s::gi-gr construct were expected to be present throughout the day/night cycle in ld in the transgenic plants. experiments with two other epitope tagged versions of 35s::gi supported this idea as immunoblotting with antibodies directed to these epitope tags showed there was only a slight variation in the steady state levels of those fusion proteins in total protein extracts in ld  <cit> . in addition, the gi protein fusions to these epitope tags were functional in that they could rescue the late flowering phenotype of gi- <dig> mutants in ld  <cit> .

the gi-gr fusion proteins described here would be expected to be non functional in the absence of added steroid and retained in the cytoplasm, while in the presence of dex, the fusion protein would relocate to the nucleus and be activated . this would provide the opportunity to test the ability of the dex activated gi-gr fusion protein to rescue the late flowering gi- <dig> phenotype and induce gene expression.

four independent, homozygous, single-locus insertion lines of 35s::gi-gr gi- <dig>  named tg <dig> to tg <dig>  were generated and used for further work. as expected from a transgene expressed from the 35s promoter, total gi transcript accumulated to higher levels in all four tg lines compared to col plants . to test if the 35s::gi-gr construct was functional, groups of tg, col and gi- <dig> mutant plants were grown in ld conditions and watered either with dex  or control solutions . dex application started at seed imbibition and was repeated every  <dig> to  <dig> days after that. photographs of  <dig> day old plants showed that +dex tg plants had well-developed inflorescences, but like gi- <dig> plants, the -dex tg plants showed no sign of flowering . this indicated that dex induction of the gi-gr fusion protein in the tg lines rescued the late flowering gi- <dig> mutant phenotype.

flowering time was measured by analyzing leaf number and by counting the days from germination to flowering. the tg lines flowered earlier in the presence of dex than in its absence using either method . the results from graphing leaf counts over time demonstrated that tg and control plants produce leaves at a similar rate as the control plants in all treatments before flowering , while the flowering time of col and gi- <dig> mutant plants was not affected by dex application .

one exception was the -dex tg <dig> plant group which flowered with  <dig>  +/- sd  <dig>  leaves indicating some "leakiness" in the control of flowering by the 35s::gi-gr construct in this transgenic line. this was unexpected as qrt-pcr of gi transcript levels  indicated that gi transcript accumulated to a similar level in tg <dig> and tg <dig>  it is possible that this difference between the two tg lines might be due to a slight change in the gr portion of the fusion protein that occurred only in the tg <dig> transgenic plant. this may have led to it being retained less well in the cytoplasm in the absence of dex in these plants. the sub-cellular location of the gi-gr fusions could be analysed using western blotting on plant sub-cellular fractions. unfortunately, antibodies we raised to the gi protein did not detect gi in plant extracts and a commercial antibody could not be located that would detect the gr portion in immunoblotting.

in order to gain insight into when the tg lines first became responsive to dex, groups of tg <dig> plants were grown in ld conditions and sprayed with dex every  <dig> days starting with the first group where seeds were imbibed with dex  and the last group treated from  <dig> days old . flowering time measurements showed that plants sprayed from day  <dig> onwards  were significantly later flowering than day  <dig> plants  . this indicated that the tg <dig> plants were responsive to dex within the first 8- <dig> days of development. in another experiment with the tg <dig> line, we obtained similar results and found that plants remained sensitive to dex even when it was first applied to much older plants - at  <dig> days-old, an age by which wild type col plants would have flowered . these +dex tg plants flowered with an average of  <dig>  leaves +/- sd  <dig>  compared to the -dex controls which flowered at  <dig>  leaves +/- sd  <dig> 

induction of flowering gene expression in the transgenic lines  <dig> h after dex application
since dex treatments led to a dramatic reduction in flowering time of the 35s::gi-gr gi- <dig> mutant plants, we expected that potent flowering time activators such as ft would be induced by dex application. in order to begin to investigate the effect of dex induction of gi activity on gene expression in floral inductive ld, we used quantitative reverse transcriptase rt-pcr  to measure the effect on known gi downstream flowering-time genes, co, ft and soc <dig>  fifteen day-old plants from all four of the tg lines and controls grown in ld on agar plates were treated with dex and then harvested  <dig> h later,  <dig> hours after lights on, during the late afternoon  on day  <dig> .

the selection of this growth regime and harvest time was an important consideration. first, as we were interested in the promotive effects of gi on flowering, we carried out the experiments in ld. second, previous work had shown that both ft and co gene expression cycles with high points late in the light period of ld  <cit> . third, plants constitutively over-expressing gi had higher co transcript levels throughout the day/night cycle, while they retained cyclical ft expression  <cit> . thus, once the gi-gr fusion had been activated by dex, it was expected that co expression would be able to be analyzed at any time during the day/night cycle, and ft expression during the afternoon. by applying dex at zt <dig> on day  <dig>  when gi protein levels normally peak in wild type plants  <cit> , we reasoned that we would be exposing the plants to the effects of gi activation both on days  <dig> and  <dig>  thus maximizing the gene expression response by zt <dig> on day  <dig> 

the response of ft expression to  <dig> h dex application was the strongest of the three genes . the increase ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold. two of the +dex tg lines had ft levels as high as the -dex col plants. the gi- <dig> mutant expressed ft at  <dig>  and  <dig> × the level of col plants at zt <dig> and zt <dig>  respectively. levels of ft were higher in the -dex tg lines than in the gi- <dig> mutant , indicating some leakiness in the function of the gene construct, but still less than the levels observed in col plants . the good level of dex induction of ft transcript accumulation was consistent with the acceleration of flowering in tg lines treated with dex .

in three of the +dex tg lines, co expression rose weakly , while the fourth line showed a more dramatic boost with an increase of  <dig> × over the -dex controls . co expression in the +dex tg lines was higher than in col plants at zt <dig> in all cases. however, we observed high background co gene expression in -dex tg plants; the gi- <dig> mutant expressed co at  <dig>  and  <dig> × the level of col plants at zt <dig> and zt <dig>  respectively, but expression in the -dex tg plants was higher at  <dig>  to  <dig> × the level of col plants. this high level of co expression, close to wild type col levels, was not expected as it did not correlate with the late flowering observed in the -dex tg plants.

slight differences between +dex tg and -dex tg plants were also observed for soc <dig> expression; but there was less than a two-fold increase in the +dex lines  . background levels of soc <dig> expression in the -dex tg plants were high as they were similar to col plants at zt <dig>  even higher background levels were observed at zt <dig>  at this time point, all the -dex tg lines had soc <dig> expression that was higher than col plants. the gi- <dig> mutant itself expressed moderate levels of soc <dig> at about  <dig> × that of col plants at zt <dig> and zt <dig> . this was consistent with previous reports on the effect of gi mutations on soc <dig> expression in whole seedlings  <cit> . a much greater effect of gi mutations on soc <dig> expression in the shoot apex would be expected as there is strong up regulation of soc <dig> in the shoot apex in ld  <cit> , but this would be greatly diluted in our experiments as we examined soc <dig> expression in total aerial parts of young plants.

we also confirmed gi transcript levels in the transgenic plants were not affected by dex application. dex was applied at zt <dig> to 21- day-old tg <dig> plants grown on agar plates in ld. qrt-pcr showed that gi transcript levels were the same in the -dex/+dex plants when they were compared at  <dig> different time points;  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h or  <dig> h later .

induction of flowering gene expression in the transgenic lines  <dig> and  <dig> h after dex application
since the  <dig> h dex treatment gave increases in flowering gene expression, particularly ft, for all tg lines  the dex treatment was decreased to gain some insight into the kinetics of this induction . in this experiment, dex was sprayed onto plants grown in plant growth cabinets. this was done to match the gene expression experiments to the conditions used to measure flowering time and examine if the high background levels of flowering time gene expression in the -dex plants  was also observed in plants growing in these non- sterile conditions.

ft expression in the tg lines showed more than a 4-fold increase in +dex tg lines  <dig> h after dex application compared to -dex tg plants . the +dex tg lines expressed ft to ~ <dig> × the level of wild type col plants  <dig> h after dex was applied. co expression was increased >3× after  <dig> h in both the +dex tg lines compared to -dex treatments and was at a higher level than in col plants . soc <dig> expression in both + dex tg lines was not increased and it was expressed at a comparable level to the controls at zt <dig>  indicating that  <dig> h was not sufficient to alter soc <dig> expression in these conditions.

in the -dex tg lines, ft transcript levels were less than  <dig> × that of wild type col plants, co transcript was  <dig> × that detected in col plants and soc <dig> expression was  <dig> × the level of col plants. using wild type col as a calibrator, it appeared that the background gene expression in the -dex tg plants was reduced when plants were grown in non sterile conditions  compared to on agar plates .

the spray assay for ft expression was repeated in a time course where  <dig> day old plants were sprayed at zt <dig> and harvested  <dig> h later  and  <dig> h later at zt <dig> . the gi- <dig> mutant was included to test the level of ft expression in this mutant when grown in non-sterile conditions and compare it to the -dex tg plants. after  <dig> h of induction  the +dex tg line showed a  <dig> -fold ft induction over the -dex tg control. the -dex tg line expressed ft at  <dig> × the level of col and  <dig> × the level of gi- <dig>  thus, the accumulation of ft in the -dex tg line was higher than gi- <dig>  but considerably less than observed in col plants, consistent with the flowering time data. after  <dig> h of induction, at zt <dig>  ft levels in all genotypes tested were very low. this was expected as ft expression cycled even when gi was constitutively expressed; zt <dig> was a low point in the ft expression cycle, coming after a period of darkness when ft accumulation drastically declines due to the instability of the co protein during darkness .

expression of the putative flowering time gene hap3a and the circadian clock gene toc <dig> after application of dex
accumulation of transcript of heme activator protein 3a  a putative flowering time regulator proposed to be positively regulated by gi  <cit>  and the circadian clock gene toc <dig> was examined. toc <dig> transcript accumulation was previously proposed as being positively regulated by gi in a regulatory sub-circuit of the circadian clock  <cit> .

in plants over expressing gi , hap3a had been detected at all time points and at increased levels particularly towards the end of the day, compared to wild type plants  <cit> . therefore, hap3a expression was analysed either  <dig> h after dex application , or  <dig> h after dex spraying , in tg and control plants. hap3a expression was generally very similar across all genotypes and treatments . no induction of hap3a expression was seen in +dex tg lines compared to -dex lines in either experiment.

expression of the clock gene toc <dig> is circadian regulated and peaks in the late afternoon  <cit> . we tested if dex application led to induction of toc <dig> at zt <dig>   or at zt <dig> or at zt  <dig>  . toc <dig> was expressed at higher levels in the evening than at dawn in wild type col plants as expected . this pattern was seen in all the genotypes including the +dex tg line, indicating that dex induction of gi activity had not altered the pattern of core-clock gene regulation in ld. the daily expression pattern of two other core-clock genes was also not altered by dex application in this experiment . toc <dig> expression was similar across all genotypes in these experiments. neither loss of gi activity in the gi- <dig> mutant, or induction of gi activity in the +dex tg lines resulted in changes to toc <dig> expression compared to col plants . an experiment was also performed where plants grown in liquid culture in continuous light were exposed to dex, but again there was no change in toc <dig> or hap3a expression after  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h of dex treatment of tg <dig> and tg <dig> plants .

CONCLUSIONS
dex application to the tg lines successfully rescued the late flowering phenotype conferred by the gi- <dig> mutation. the induction of gi activity by dex supports the idea that gi functions to promote flowering from within the nucleus as suggested by the work of sawa et al.  <cit>  and previously in transient assays when gi-reporter fusion proteins were observed in the nucleus and a nuclear-localisation region was defined  <cit> . consistent with induction of flowering by dex, increased transcript accumulation of the gi downstream floral promoters co and ft was observed in tg plants after  <dig> h of dex application.

co has been proposed to trigger expression of ft by interacting with the hap protein trimeric complex which binds to promoter ccaat boxes  <cit> . hap3a transcript levels were observed to increase in gi-over expressing transgenic plants, suggesting that gi may regulate hap3a  <cit> . however, no induction of hap3a was observed in our tg lines in the experimental time frame used here suggesting that transcript accumulation of hap3a may not be directly regulated by gi.

modeling and experimental testing of circadian clock function predicted that gi would fulfill part of a predicted "y" function needed to stimulate toc <dig> expression in the interlocking loop model of the circadian clock  <cit> . experiments with the tg lines show no induction of gi activity by dex on toc <dig> transcript levels and no reduction in toc <dig> levels in the gi- <dig> mutant, suggesting that this gene may not be directly regulated by gi. it is possible that we missed a transient increase in toc <dig> expression. some effects of gi mutations on toc <dig> transcript accumulation were reported previously, but these experiments were carried out under very different light or temperature regimes from this work  <cit> .

the tg plants were responsive to dex induction of gi within the first 8- <dig> days of development. however, floral buds were only visible when the plants were ~ <dig> days-old, and the +dex tg plants were slightly later flowering than wild type col control plants . the responses of the gi-gr tg plants to dex application also were more modest that seen in 35s::co-gr plants. the latter responded to dex from the time of seed imbibition and flowered significantly earlier than wild type plants in ld  <cit> . this suggests that there was some limitation on the activity of the gi-gr fusion protein. this contrasts with work in this laboratory with other epitope-tagged versions of gi that fully complemented the gi- <dig> mutant  <cit> . unfortunately, we were not able to verify the effect of dex on the cellular localization of the gi-gr fusion protein, as antibodies we raised to the gi protein did not detect gi in plant protein extracts, and a commercial antibody could not be located that would detect the gr portion in western blotting.

an intriguing problem encountered was that despite the -dex tg plants being late flowering, there were often very high levels of expression of gi downstream genes such as co in these tg lines compared with the gi- <dig> mutant. one explanation is that the leaky expression of genes such as co was in tissues that were not competent to respond to it and thus ft expression and flowering was not strongly promoted. for example, expression of co in the companion cells of the phloem using tissue specific promoters is highly floral promotive, whereas expression of co in the shoot apex does not promote flowering  <cit> .

in conclusion, the gi-gr system described here was functional in promoting flowering and allowed tests of induction of putative gi downstream genes. however, given the leaky gene expression observed and that full activity of gi-gr was not achieved, development of systems that tightly regulate the temporal and spatial control of gi transcript rather than a post translational system may be preferable in future work. for example, constructs that lead to induction of gi transcription specifically in the phloem would be interesting for further study of the effect of gi on flowering time.
