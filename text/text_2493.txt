BACKGROUND
signals and nutrients are transported within and between the organs of most multicellular organisms by tissue networks. what controls the formation of tissue networks is thus a central question in biology. in animals, many of these networks are stereotyped  <cit> ; by contrast, the vein networks of plant leaves are both reproducible and variable  <cit> . consider, for example, the vein network of an arabidopsis thaliana leaf : lateral veins branch from a single midvein and connect to distal veins to form loops; minor veins branch from midvein and loops, and connect to other veins to form a mesh; and loops and minor veins curve near the leaf margin to lend a scalloped outline to the vein network. geometric features of the vein network such as these are reproducible from leaf to leaf—so much so that they are used as a taxonomic characteristic . by contrast, topological features of the vein network are variable : the number of veins differs from leaf to leaf, and whether a vein will connect to another vein on both ends or one end will terminate free of contact with other veins is unpredictable; this is always so for minor veins, but even loops can occasionally fail to connect to other veins at one end.

while no evidence is available that associates geometric features of vein networks with the networks’ functional traits, abundant evidence exists that associates functional traits of vein networks with the networks’ topological features ; yet our knowledge of the signals that control vein network topology is limited, and most such signals also control vein network geometry . one of very few exceptions  is the control of vein network topology by intracellular transport of the plant signal auxin suggested by genetic evidence: leaves of double mutants in the genes encoding the endoplasmic-reticulum -localized pin-formed <dig>  and pin <dig> auxin transporters of arabidopsis  have higher vein-density  <cit> ; the vein density defect of pin6;pin <dig> leaves is suppressed by mutation of the gene encoding the er-localized pin <dig> auxin transporter  <cit> ; overexpression of pin <dig> or pin <dig> results in lower vein-density, and overexpression of pin <dig> results in the opposite defect  <cit> .

in contrast to the control of vein network topology by intracellular auxin transport, no genetic evidence is available in support of a role for the cell-to-cell transport of auxin in control of vein network topology; yet such a role seems to be suggested by imaging and inhibitor studies. expression of the pin <dig> auxin efflux protein  <cit>  is initiated in broad domains of leaf inner cells that become gradually restricted to files of vascular precursor cells in contact with pre-existing, narrow pin <dig> expression domains . within broad expression domains, pin <dig> is localized isotropically—or nearly so—to the plasma membrane  of leaf inner cells. as expression of pin <dig> becomes gradually restricted to files of vascular precursor cells, pin <dig> localization becomes polarized to the side of the pm facing the pre-existing, narrow pin <dig> expression domains with which the narrowing domains are in contact. initially, pin <dig> expression domains are in contact with pre-existing domains at one end only, but they can eventually become connected to other pin <dig> expression domains at both ends. inhibitors of cellular auxin efflux delay the restriction of pin <dig> expression domains and the polarization of pin <dig> localization  <cit> , and induce the formation of more veins  <cit> .

the polar localization of pin <dig> to the pm of vascular cells—toward pre-existing veins and ultimately the root tip—is thought to determine the polarity of intercellular auxin transport  <cit> : from the immature shoot-organs, where auxin is produced in large amounts  <cit> , to the roots  <cit> . by contrast, the directions of er-pin-mediated intracellular auxin-transport are unclear. available evidence suggests that pin <dig> transports auxin from the cytoplasm to the er lumen  <cit> , and that pin <dig> and pin <dig> transport it from the er lumen to the cytoplasm or the nucleus , the envelope of which is continuous with the er membrane  <cit> ; alternatively, pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> could transport in the same direction but have different affinities for different auxins with different developmental functions .

here we asked whether pin1-mediated intercellular auxin-transport controlled vein network topology and, if so, whether it interacted with the control of vein network topology by er-pin-mediated intracellular auxin-transport. to address this question, we introduced descriptors of vein network topology that enable quantification of vein number, connectedness and continuity, and combined these topological descriptors with cellular imaging and molecular genetic analysis to quantify the contribution of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> to vein network topology. we derived cellular expression and genetic interaction maps of these genes in vein network formation, and suggest that the interaction between pin1-mediated intercellular auxin-transport and er-pin-mediated intracellular auxin-transport controls the formation of veins and their connection into networks.

RESULTS
expression of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> during leaf development

two distinct auxin-transport pathways have overlapping functions in control of arabidopsis vein-network geometry  <cit> . one pathway—mediated by the pm-localized pin <dig> protein—transports auxin intercellularly  <cit> ; the other pathway—mediated by the er-localized pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> proteins—transports auxin intracellularly .

consistent with their role in control of vein network geometry  <cit> , pin <dig> , pin <dig> , and pin <dig>  are expressed in developing veins, although with different dynamics: expression of pin <dig> and pin <dig> is initiated in broad domains of leaf inner cells, domains that over time become restricted to single files of vascular precursor cells  ; by contrast, pin <dig> expression is restricted from early on to single files of leaf vascular cells  <cit>  . it remains unclear, however, whether these different dynamics of pin expression comprise onset of pin expression at different stages of leaf development.

to address this question, we compared expression of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in first leaves  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after germination . to visualize pin expression, we used functional translational fusions   <cit>  or transcriptional fusions   <cit>  ; whenever we used transcriptional fusions, their expression matched that of the respective, functional translational fusions  <cit>  , suggesting that those pin promoters contain all the regulatory elements required for functional expression of the respective genes.

while expression of a pin1::pin1:gfp translational fusion  and of a pin6::yfpnuc transcriptional fusion  was already visible  <dig> dag , expression of pin8::yfpnuc was first detected  <dig> dag , suggesting that pin <dig> expression is initiated after the onset of expression of both pin <dig> and pin <dig> 

pin <dig>  is expressed in veins of mature leaves  <cit> , but its expression during leaf development is unknown. transcriptional and translational fusions of pin <dig> are expressed in similar domains  <cit> , suggesting that the pin <dig> promoter contains all the regulatory elements required for pin <dig> expression. thus, to visualize pin <dig> expression during leaf development, we imaged pin5::yfpnuc expression in first leaves  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  dag.

expression of pin5::yfpnuc was first detected in the midvein of 4-dag leaves ; at  <dig> dag, pin5::yfpnuc was additionally expressed in first loops , and at  <dig>  dag pin5::yfpnuc was additionally expressed in second loops and minor veins . thus our results suggest that pin <dig> expression is initiated after pin <dig> expression  and that, as pin <dig>  pin <dig> is expressed from early on in single files of leaf vascular cells .

expression of pin <dig> in single files of leaf vascular cells—suggested by pin5::yfpnuc expression—was supported by expression of two functional   <cit>  pin5::pin5:gfp translational fusions .

expression of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in leaf vascular cells
because pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> are all expressed in developing veins , we asked whether these genes were expressed in the same vascular cells. to address this question, we imaged pairwise combinations of fluorescent reporters of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in midvein cells of 4-dag first leaves—where these genes are expressed —and quantified reporter coexpression.

in none of the  <dig> analyzed leaves coexpressing pin5::yfpnuc and pin6::cfpnuc  were cells expressing pin5::yfpnuc ever on the same plane as cells expressing pin6::cfpnuc: cells expressing pin5::yfpnuc were located ventrally, while cells expressing pin6::cfpnuc were located dorsally . likewise, in none of the  <dig> analyzed leaves coexpressing pin8::yfpnuc and pin6::cfpnuc were cells expressing pin8::yfpnuc ever on the same plane as cells expressing pin6::cfpnuc: cells expressing pin8::yfpnuc were located ventrally, while cells expressing pin6::cfpnuc were located dorsally . and although cells expressing pin5::yfpnuc or pin8::pin8:gfpmgs were both on the same ventral plane , only fewer than  <dig> % of the cells expressing either reporter expressed both .fig.  <dig> expression of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in leaf vascular cells. a-r. top right: expression-reported gene. confocal laser scanning microscopy; first leaves. a-r. expression of pin5::yfpnuc , pin6::cfpnuc , pin8::yfpnuc , pin8::pin8:gfpmgs , pin1::pin1:gfp , pin6::yfpnuc , and respective overlays . s. proportional venn diagrams of percentage of cells expressing fluorescent reporters in 25-μm by 25-μm midvein regions of 4-day-old first leaves  in different pairwise combinations of reporters. sample population sizes: pin5::yfpnuc;pin8::pin8:gfpmgs,  <dig> leaves ; pin5::yfpnuc;pin1::pin1:gfp,  <dig> leaves ; pin8::yfpnuc;pin1::pin1:gfp,  <dig> leaves ; pin6::yfpnuc;pin1::pin1:gfp,  <dig> leaves . d, dorsal focal plane; v, ventral focal plane. bars:  5 μm



approximately 95 % of pin5::yfpnuc-expressing cells expressed pin1::pin1:gfp, but only ~25 % of the pin1::pin1:gfp-expressing cells that were on the same ventral plane as cells expressing pin5::yfpnuc expressed this reporter . likewise, ~90 % of pin8::yfpnuc-expressing cells expressed pin1::pin1:gfp, but only ~25 % of the pin1::pin1:gfp-expressing cells that were on the same ventral plane as cells expressing pin8::yfpnuc expressed this reporter . finally, consistent with previous observations  <cit> , ~95 % of pin6::yfpnuc-expressing cells expressed pin1::pin1:gfp, and ~75 % of the pin1::pin1:gfp-expressing cells that were on the same dorsal plane as cells expressing pin6::yfpnuc expressed this reporter .

thus our results suggest that pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> are expressed in mutually exclusive domains of leaf vascular cells, and that the pin <dig> cellular-expression domain overlaps with—but extends beyond—the er-pin cellular-expression domain.

unique and redundant functions of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in control of vein network topology
pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> control vein network geometry  <cit> ; we asked what their functions are in control of vein network topology.

to characterize vein network topology, we derived  and used three descriptors based on numerical graph invariants: a cardinality index, a continuity index, and a connectivity index.

the cardinality index is a proxy for the number of “veins”  in a network .fig.  <dig> functions of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in control of vein network topology. a. schematics of vein networks with low or high cardinality index , minimum—i.e. 0—or maximum—i.e. 1—continuity index , or minimum—i.e. 0—or maximum—i.e. 1—connectivity index . b. first leaves. indices are expressed as mean ± se. difference between pin6; <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between pin1; <dig> and pin <dig> cardinality indices, between pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices, and between pin1; <dig> and pin <dig> connectivity indices was significant at p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  , or p <  <dig>   by f-test and t-test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes: wt, 30; pin <dig>  30; pin <dig>  30; pin <dig>  27; pin6; <dig>  28; pin5;6; <dig>  28; pin <dig>  45; pin1; <dig>  57; pin1; <dig>  47; pin1; <dig>  37



the continuity index quantifies how close a vein network is to a network with the same number of veins but in which at least one end of each “vein fragment”  contacts a vein. the continuity index ranges from 0—for a network of sole vein fragments—to 1—for a network without vein fragments .

the connectivity index quantifies how close a vein network is to a network with the same number of veins but in which both ends of each vein or vein fragment contact other veins. the connectivity index ranges from 0—for a network of “open” veins —to 1—for a network of “closed” veins  .

although the number of veins in a leaf is variable and it is unpredictable whether a developing vein will remain open at maturity , the cardinality and connectivity indices of vein networks in different populations of wt leaves grown in identical conditions were reproducible . this observation suggests that while the outcome of vein formation events is unpredictable for single veins, it is predictable—within the limits of statistical variation—for networks of veins. thus—as for non-stereotyped animal-networks —topology descriptors such as the cardinality and connectivity indices can be compared statistically across genotypes and conditions to identify reproducible patterns and their controls.

the continuity index of vein networks in different populations of wt leaves grown in identical conditions was also reproducible —a finding consistent with the stringent requirement for continuity of tissue systems with transport function, such as vein networks, and with the successful use of vein fragmentation as diagnostic criterion for the identification of mutants in genetic screens  <cit> .

the continuity index of none of the mutants or transgenics in our study was different from that of wt , suggesting that pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> have no function in control of vein continuity or their functions in this process are redundant.

consistent with previous observations  <cit> , the vein network topology of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  or pin <dig> was no different from that of wt ; by contrast, the cardinality and connectivity indices of pin <dig> vein networks were higher than those of wt vein networks , suggesting that pin <dig> inhibits the formation of veins and their connection.

we next asked whether pin <dig>  pin <dig>  or pin <dig> acted redundantly with pin <dig> in inhibition of vein formation and connection. the vein network topology of neither pin1;pin <dig>  nor pin1; <dig> differed from that of pin <dig> ; however, the cardinality and connectivity indices of pin1; <dig> vein networks were higher than those of pin <dig> vein networks , suggesting that pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in inhibition of vein formation and connection.

next, we asked whether pin <dig> or pin <dig> acted redundantly with pin <dig> in pin1-dependent inhibition of vein formation and connection. the vein network topology of pin1;5; <dig> was no different from that of pin1; <dig> , but the cardinality index of pin1;6; <dig> vein networks was higher than that of pin1; <dig> vein networks , suggesting that pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in pin1-dependent inhibition of vein formation; by contrast, the connectivity index of pin1;6; <dig> vein networks was no different from that of pin1; <dig> vein networks , suggesting that pin <dig> has no function redundant to that of pin <dig> in pin1-dependent inhibition of vein connection. because the vein network topology of neither pin <dig> nor pin <dig> differs from that of wt , but the cardinality index of pin6; <dig> vein networks is higher than that of wt , pin <dig> and pin <dig> also have redundant functions in inhibition of vein formation that are independent of pin <dig>  thus the enhancement of pin1; <dig> cardinality defects by pin <dig> could be interpreted as the result of the simultaneous loss of the pin1-dependent pathway and of the parallel, pin6/pin8-dependent, pin1-independent pathway—rather than evidence that pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in pin1-dependent inhibition of vein formation. however, we do not favor this interpretation because the cardinality defect of pin1;6; <dig> is much greater than the sum of the cardinality defects of pin <dig> and pin6; <dig> fig.  <dig> functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in pin1/pin6-dependent control of vein network topology. first leaves. indices are expressed as mean ± se. difference between pin1;6; <dig> and pin1; <dig> cardinality indices was significant at p <  <dig>   by f-test and t-test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes: pin1; <dig>  103; pin1;5; <dig>  104; pin1;6; <dig>  98; pin1;5;6; <dig>  109



we finally asked whether pin <dig> acted redundantly with pin <dig> and pin <dig> in pin1-dependent or pin1-independent inhibition of vein formation. the vein network topology of pin1;5;6; <dig> was no different from that of pin1; <dig>  and that of pin5;6; <dig> was no different from that of wt , suggesting that pin <dig> suppresses the effects of pin <dig> and pin <dig> on pin1-independent inhibition of vein formation. in agreement with interpretations of similar genetic interactions in other organisms , the most parsimonious account for our observations is that pin <dig> promotes vein formation; that pin <dig> and pin <dig> redundantly and completely inhibit pin5-dependent promotion of vein formation; and that these functions of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> are independent of pin <dig>  further, because expression of pin <dig> and pin <dig> is initiated at post-formative stages of vein development  <cit>  , these genes most likely control vein formation indirectly—for example, through feedback on vascular precursor cells located in more-immature parts of the leaf . finally, because pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> are expressed in non-overlapping sets of vascular cells , the genetic interaction between these genes—as that between other genes expressed in mutually exclusive domains —presumably reflects underlying cell-cell interactions.

redundant functions of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> in control of auxin distribution in developing leaves
pin <dig> inhibits vein formation, and pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in inhibition of vein formation and with pin <dig> in pin1-independent inhibition of vein formation . we asked whether such redundancy extended to control of auxin distribution in developing leaves, which is known to control vein formation  <cit> . to address this question, we imaged expression of the auxin reporter dr5rev::yfpnuc  <cit>  in 4-dag first leaves of wt, pin6; <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin1; <dig> 

as previously reported  <cit> , in wt the dr <dig> promoter was strongly active in narrow domains that coincide with sites of vein formation . consistent with previous observations , dr5rev::yfpnuc expression was weaker in pin6; <dig> than in wt, but domains of dr5rev::yfpnuc expression were equally narrow in pin6; <dig> and wt . levels of dr5rev::yfpnuc expression were lower, and domains of dr5rev::yfpnuc expression were broader, in pin <dig> than in wt or pin6; <dig> ; and dr5rev::yfpnuc expression levels were even lower, and dr5rev::yfpnuc expression domains even broader, in pin1; <dig> .fig.  <dig> expression of dr5rev::yfpnuc in pin developing leaves. a-d. confocal laser scanning microscopy; first leaves  <dig> days after germination. look-up table  visualizes expression levels. top right: genotype. bottom left: reproducibility index. dashed white line delineates leaf primordium outline. images in a, b, c and e were taken at identical settings and show increasingly weaker dr5rev::yfpnuc expression in pin6; <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin1; <dig>  images in a, d and f were taken by matching signal intensity to detector’s input range , and show increasingly broader dr5rev::yfpnuc expression domains in pin <dig> and pin1; <dig>  bars:  50 μm



thus our results suggest that the redundancy between pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> that underlies control of vein formation extends to control of auxin distribution in developing leaves .

homologous and nonhomologous functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in vein network formation
pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in control of vein network geometry  <cit>  and topology ; however, the redundancy between pin <dig> and pin <dig> is unequal: the geometry and topology of pin <dig> vein networks are no different from those of wt vein networks but those of pin <dig> vein networks are, suggesting that pin <dig> can provide all—or nearly all—the functions of pin <dig> in vein network formation and that, by contrast, pin <dig> is unable to provide all the functions of pin <dig> in this process. such unequal redundancy could reflect nonhomologous functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in vein network formation—a possibility consistent with the different localization of pin <dig> and pin6: pin <dig> is predominantly localized to the pm  <cit> , while pin <dig> is predominantly localized to the er  <cit> . on the other hand—at least in other organisms—redundant, homologous functions can be provided by proteins that are localized to different cellular compartments . further, at least some of the functions of pin <dig> in vein network formation depend on pin <dig> expression in leaf epidermal cells  <cit> —leaf epidermal cells that fail, by contrast, to express pin <dig>  <cit>  . thus the unequal redundancy of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in vein network formation could alternatively be accounted for by their different expression domains.

to test these possibilities, we used the promoter of the ribosomal protein s5a  gene —highly active in developing organs, including their epidermal cells  <cit> —to express pin <dig>  or pin <dig>  in the pin <dig> background, and compared phenotype features of rps5a::pin1;pin <dig> and rps5a::pin6;pin <dig> with those of pin <dig> and wt.

we first asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in control of vein network geometry homologous to those of pin <dig>  the geometry of ~15 % of the vein networks of rps5a::pin <dig> and rps5a::pin <dig>  and—as previously reported  <cit> —of nearly 50 % of pin <dig> vein networks was abnormal . rps5a::pin <dig> shifted the spectrum of vein network geometries of pin <dig> toward the vein network geometry of wt but rps5a::pin <dig> failed to do so , suggesting that pin <dig> is unable to provide functions in control of vein network geometry homologous to those of pin <dig> fig.  <dig> functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in vein network formation. a-c. dark-field illumination of mature first leaves illustrating phenotype classes: unbranched, narrow midvein and scalloped vein-network outline ; bifurcated midvein and scalloped vein-network outline ; fused leaves with scalloped vein-network outline . d. percentages of leaves in phenotype classes. difference between rps5a::pin <dig> and wt, between rps5a::pin <dig> and wt, between pin <dig> and wt, and between rps5a::pin1;pin <dig> and pin <dig> was significant at p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  , or p <  <dig>   by kruskal-wallis and mann–whitney test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes: wt, 65; rps5a::pin <dig>  55; rps5a::pin <dig>  58;pin <dig>  116; rps5a::pin1;pin <dig>  71; rps5a::pin6;pin <dig>   <dig>  e. first leaves. indices are expressed as mean ± se. difference between rps5a::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between rps5a::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between rps5a::pin1;pin <dig> and pin <dig> cardinality indices, between rps5a::pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices, between pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices, between rps5a::pin1;pin <dig> and pin <dig> connectivity indices, and between rps5a::pin6;pin <dig> and pin <dig> connectivity indices was significant at p <  <dig>  , p <  <dig>  , or p <  <dig>   by f-test and t-test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes as in . bars:  1 mm



we next asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in control of vein network topology homologous to those of pin <dig>  the cardinality and connectivity indices of rps5a::pin <dig> vein networks were lower than those of wt vein networks , supporting that pin <dig> inhibits vein formation and connection. the cardinality index of rps5a::pin <dig> vein networks was higher than that of wt vein networks , suggesting that ectopic expression of pin <dig> in the epidermis promotes vein formation. as reported above , the cardinality and connectivity indices of pin <dig> vein networks were higher than those of wt vein networks . rps5a::pin <dig> shifted the cardinality index of pin <dig> vein networks toward that of wt vein networks but rps5a::pin <dig> failed to do so , suggesting that pin <dig> is unable to provide functions in vein formation homologous to those of pin <dig>  by contrast, both rps5a::pin <dig> and rps5a::pin <dig> shifted the connectivity index of pin <dig> vein networks toward that of wt vein networks , suggesting that pin <dig> can provide functions in vein connection homologous to those of pin <dig>  interpretations of similar genetic interactions in other organisms  suggest that the suppression of vein connectedness defects of pin <dig> by rps5a::pin <dig> can be accounted for by at least two mechanisms. one possibility is that pin <dig> acts downstream of pin <dig> in the same pathway that controls vein connection; we do not favor this hypothesis, however, because it fails to predict the observed  enhancement of vein connectedness defects of pin <dig> by pin <dig>  alternatively, vein connection may be unfavored at high auxin levels  <cit> , which would be the result of at least two separate pathways: pin1-mediated auxin transport toward sites of vein formation   and pin6-mediated increase in auxin levels within developing vascular cells   .

in addition to vein network formation, pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in cotyledon patterning, and as in vein network formation, the redundancy between pin <dig> and pin <dig> in cotyledon patterning is unequal  <cit> . we thus asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in cotyledon patterning homologous to those of pin1; our results  suggest that it cannot.

finally, rps5a::pin <dig> reverted the pin-shaped, sterile inflorescences of pin <dig> to wt-looking, fertile inflorescences but rps5a::pin <dig> failed to do so , suggesting that pin <dig> is unable to provide functions in inflorescence development homologous to those of pin <dig> 

in summary, pin <dig> was unable to provide functions homologous to those of pin <dig> in control of vein network geometry, vein formation, cotyledon patterning, and inflorescence development. thus the unequal redundancy between pin <dig> and pin <dig> in these processes is unlikely to be the result of their different expression and might instead be accounted for by their nonhomologous functions—a conclusion consistent with the opposite effects of pin <dig> and pin <dig> on intercellular auxin transport  <cit> . by contrast, pin <dig> was able to provide functions in vein connection homologous to those of pin <dig>  suggesting that pin <dig> expression normally limits the ability of pin <dig> to compensate for the effects of loss of pin <dig> function in vein connection.

homologous functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in pin1-dependent vein-network formation
pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in pin1-dependent control of vein network geometry  <cit>  and vein formation ; however, the redundancy between pin <dig> and pin <dig> in pin1-dependent control of vein network formation is unequal: the geometry and cardinality index of pin1; <dig> vein networks are no different from those of pin <dig> vein networks, but those of pin1; <dig> vein networks are; thus pin <dig> can provide all the functions of pin <dig> in pin1-dependent control of vein network geometry and vein formation, but pin <dig> is unable to provide all the functions of pin <dig> in these processes. further, pin <dig> seems to have no function in pin1/pin6-dependent vein connection. the unequal functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in vein network formation could be accounted for by the different expression of pin <dig> and pin <dig> during vein development  <cit>  , but it could also reflect nonhomologous functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in this process.

to test these possibilities, we expressed pin <dig> or pin <dig> by the promoter of the monopteros  gene  —highly active in developing veins  <cit> —in the pin1; <dig> background, and compared defects of mp::pin6;pin1; <dig> and mp::pin8;pin1; <dig> with those of pin1; <dig> and pin <dig> 

we first asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in pin1-dependent control of vein network geometry homologous to those of pin <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> , the vein network geometry of mp::pin <dig> and mp::pin <dig> was no different from that of wt . by contrast, the geometry of nearly 60 % of pin <dig> vein networks was abnormal, and pin <dig> shifted the spectrum of vein network geometries of pin <dig> toward more severe phenotype classes  <cit>  . the spectrum of vein network geometries of mp::pin6;pin1; <dig> was no different from that of pin <dig> and that of mp::pin8;pin1; <dig> was no different from that of mp::pin6;pin1; <dig> , suggesting that pin <dig> can provide functions in pin1-dependent control of vein network geometry homologous to those of pin <dig> fig.  <dig> functions of pin <dig> and pin <dig> in pin1-dependent vein network formation. a-d. dark-field illumination of mature first leaves illustrating phenotype classes: conspicuous marginal vein ; fused leaves with conspicuous marginal vein ; wide midvein ; fused leaves with wide midvein . phenotype classes i-iii as in fig.  <dig>  e. percentages of leaves in phenotype classes. difference between pin <dig> and wt, and between pin1; <dig> and pin <dig> was significant at p <  <dig>   by kruskal-wallis and mann–whitney test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes: wt, 53; pin <dig>  46; pin1; <dig>  42; mp::pin <dig>  54; mp::pin <dig>  49; mp::pin6;pin1; <dig>  45; mp::pin8;pin1; <dig>   <dig>  f. first leaves. indices are expressed as mean ± se. difference between pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between pin1; <dig> and pin <dig> cardinality indices, between mp::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between mp::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices, between pin1; <dig> and pin <dig> connectivity indices, between mp::pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices, and between mp::pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices was significant at p <  <dig>   by f-test and t-test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes as in . bars:  1 mm;   <dig>  mm



we next asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in pin1-dependent control of vein network topology homologous to those of pin <dig>  consistent with previous observations  <cit> , mp::pin <dig> and mp::pin <dig> induced similar defects—as it frequently results from overexpression of genes with homologous functions : the cardinality and connectivity indices of both mp::pin <dig> and mp::pin <dig> vein networks were lower than those of wt vein networks , supporting that pin <dig> inhibits vein formation and connection, and suggesting that pin <dig> can inhibit vein connection in addition to vein formation. as reported above , the cardinality and connectivity indices of pin <dig> vein networks were higher than those of wt vein networks and those of pin1; <dig> vein networks were higher than those of pin <dig> vein networks . the vein network topology of mp::pin6;pin1; <dig> was no different from that of pin <dig> and that of mp::pin8;pin1; <dig> was no different from that of mp::pin6;pin1; <dig> , suggesting that pin <dig> can provide functions in pin1-dependent control of vein network topology homologous to those of pin <dig> 

in addition to pin1-dependent vein-network formation, pin <dig> acts redundantly with pin <dig> in pin1-dependent cotyledon patterning, and as in pin1-dependent vein network formation, the redundancy between pin <dig> and pin <dig> in pin1-dependent cotyledon patterning is unequal  <cit> . we thus asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in pin1-dependent cotyledon patterning homologous to those of pin6; our results  suggest that it can.

in summary, pin <dig> was able to provide functions homologous to pin <dig> in pin1-dependent vein network formation and cotyledon patterning. thus the unequal redundancy between pin <dig> and pin <dig> is unlikely the result of nonhomologous functions and might instead be accounted for by their different expression. just as the er-pin genes pin <dig> and pin <dig> redundantly control pin1-dependent vein network formation, the redundancy between the pm-pin genes pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  pin <dig>  and pin <dig> underlies— to varying extents—many other developmental processes . in the development of embryos and roots, pm-pin genes compensate for loss of one another’s function by their ectopic expression in the domain of the gene whose function has been lost  <cit> . for example, in pin <dig> embryos pin <dig> becomes expressed at earlier stages of development and in the domain in which pin <dig> is normally expressed, thereby compensating for loss of pin <dig> function  <cit> . by contrast, in the pin1; <dig> background pin <dig> expression remains restricted to post-formative stages of vein development  <cit> , supporting that pin <dig> controls vein network formation by feeding back on vascular precursor cells located in more-immature parts of the leaf.

functions of pin <dig> in pin6/pin8-dependent control of vein network topology
pin <dig> has functions in control of vein network topology beyond control of pin <dig> function . we asked whether pin <dig> could provide functions in control of vein network topology that are independent of control by pin <dig> or pin <dig> 

to address this question, we used plants expressing pin <dig> by the mp promoter  because the vein density of mp::pin <dig> leaves is higher than that of wt leaves  <cit> . we reasoned that if pin <dig> could provide functions that are independent of control by pin <dig> or pin <dig>  at least some of the effects of mp::pin <dig> on vein network topology should persist in the mp::pin <dig> or mp::pin <dig> backgrounds. by contrast, if all pin5’s functions depended on control by pin <dig> or pin <dig>  the effects of mp::pin <dig> or mp::pin <dig> on vein network topology should mask those of mp::pin <dig> 

consistent with previous observations  <cit> , the cardinality index of mp::pin <dig> vein networks was higher than that of wt vein networks , supporting that pin <dig> promotes vein formation. as reported above , the cardinality and connectivity indices of mp::pin <dig> and mp::pin <dig> vein networks were lower than those of wt vein networks . because the vein network topology of mp::pin5;mp::pin <dig> was no different from that of mp::pin <dig> and that of mp::pin5;mp::pin <dig> was no different from that of mp::pin <dig> , we conclude that no function of pin <dig> escapes control by pin <dig> or pin <dig> fig.  <dig> functions of pin <dig> in pin6/pin8-dependent control of vein network topology. first leaves. indices are expressed as mean ± se. difference between mp::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between mp::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between mp::pin <dig> and wt cardinality indices, between mp::pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices, and between mp::pin <dig> and wt connectivity indices was significant at p <  <dig>   or p <  <dig>   by f-test and t-test with bonferroni correction. sample population sizes: wt, 27; mp::pin <dig>  48; mp::pin <dig>  32; mp::pin <dig>  32; mp::pin5;mp::pin <dig>  31; mp::pin5;mp::pin <dig>  40

the “auxin canalization hypothesis” proposes that a positive feedback between auxin movement through a cell and localization of auxin efflux proteins to the site where auxin leaves the cell leads to the selection of cell files from within a field of cells; such cell files would become exposed to inductive levels of auxin, would differentiate into efficient auxin-transport canals—the veins—and would drain auxin from the surrounding areas  <cit> . auxin drainage by developing veins would lower auxin levels in the surrounding areas below those levels which inhibit growth  <cit> , growth would resume, and new fields of cells would be generated in which the whole process could be repeated  <cit> .

the predictions of the auxin canalization hypothesis have been rigorously tested and are supported by computer simulation of mathematical models ; nevertheless, inconsistencies seem to exist between experimental evidence and hypothesis’ predictions. for example, the hypothesis appears unable to predict the experimentally observed high levels of auxin in veins  <cit> ; however, such levels could be, at least in part, the result of pin1-mediated auxin transport toward sites of vein formation  <cit>  , and of pin6/pin8-mediated increase in auxin levels within developing vascular cells  . we suggest that because of the lower auxin levels in pin6; <dig>  , auxin would be drained more efficiently in leaves of this background, leaf growth would resume sooner, and veins would form faster—a prediction supported by the faster formation of vein-associated domains of pin <dig> expression in pin6; <dig>  <cit> —thus leading to the formation of networks of more veins . because of the reduced intercellular auxin-transport in pin <dig>  <cit> , auxin would accumulate for longer periods in leaves of this background before inducing efficient drainage canals, thereby exposing more cells to inductive levels of auxin—a prediction consistent with the broader domains of dr5rev::yfpnuc expression in pin <dig> —and thus leading to the formation of networks of more veins . because of the additionally lower levels of auxin in pin1;6—suggested by the mimicry of pin1; <dig> defects by reduction of auxin levels in pin <dig>  <cit>  and by the lower levels of dr5rev::yfpnuc expression in pin1; <dig> than in pin <dig> —auxin would accumulate for even longer periods before inducing efficient drainage canals, thereby exposing even more cells to inductive levels of auxin—a prediction consistent with the broader domains of dr5rev::yfpnuc expression in pin1; <dig> than in pin <dig> —and thus leading to the formation of networks of even more veins .

closed veins form during leaf development from open-vein precursors that become connected with other vein precursors at both ends . accounting for the formation of closed veins has long been a challenge for the auxin canalization hypothesis . loss of function of pin <dig> and pin <dig> leads to a network of veins that are more frequently closed, and overexpression of pin <dig>  pin <dig>  or pin <dig> leads to the opposite defect; thus—consistent with the observation that vein connections form at early stages of tissue development —our results suggest that connection may be favored—or occur exclusively—between vein precursors that have yet to differentiate high auxin-transport capacity or high auxin-transport-mediated auxin levels.
