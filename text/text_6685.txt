BACKGROUND
fulminant hepatitis mainly develops from chronic or acute hepatitis b virus  infection. it has been reported that world widely about  <dig> million people are living with chronic hbv infection. while  <dig>  people die from hbv-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, acute fulminant hepatitis b causes additional  <dig>  deaths each year <cit> .

despite the significant improvement in the antiviral treatment targeting hbv infection, the morbidity and mortality of fulminant hepatitis keep at a high level. this is at least partly due to our poor understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and the lack of early diagnosing/warning system which lead to a delayed medical intervention. as a serious illness, fulminant hepatitis is not only a threat to our health, but a big financial burden to the patient's family. therefore, an accurate diagnosis at an early stage is linked directly to an effective treatment, better recovery and lowered mortality of the disease.

because it resembles very much the human fulminant hepatitis, concanavalin a -induced hepatitis has long been used as an experimental model of immune-mediated liver disease  <cit> . it is characterized by massive hepatocellular degeneration and lymphoid infiltration of the liver  <cit> . the development of cona-induced hepatitis depends mainly upon t cell activation  <cit>  which raises plasma levels of various cytokines including tnf-α, interferon -γ, and interleukin - <dig>  <cit> . to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of human fulminant hepatitis, in this study, we utilized the cona-induced hepatitis model and selected microarray as our primary detection tool.

recently, high-throughput gene chip has increasingly been used to explore the transcription dynamics on a genome-wide scale. this raises a possibility that similar approach could be used to identify gene expression at a specific condition such as the very early stage of fulminant hepatitis. then the alternations in gene expression could possibly be used as diagnostic measures. given this aim, it is necessary to use statistical methods to help identify genes whose transcript profiles respond to liver damage. in addition, such approach involves modeling the association of a generic response with a specific experimental variable, such as timing, tissues impacted, temperature, or drug dosage. therefore, whole genome expression analysis provides a system-level insight for understanding crucial factors that control the liver damage and in turn may help us elucidate the molecular mechanisms of liver injury.

in this study, by using the cona-induced mouse fulminant hepatitis model, we analyzed the hepatic gene expression with whole genome mouse genechip . through an integrative analysis that combines changes in gene expression with gene function within a genetic network, we identified  <dig> genes that may be related to cona-induced liver injury.

RESULTS
cona-injection induces fulminant hepatitis in balb/c mice
pathological examination at indicated time periods after cona challenge showed that fulminant hepatitis mouse model was successfully made. as shown in figure  <dig>  a single injection of cona led to a clear liver damage as presented by large area of necrosis . in order to study the changes of very early stage of fulminant hepatitis, liver specimen were taken from the mice at  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h after cona administration for the further investigation.

biochemical evidence for cona-induced hepatitis
to observe the liver damage in our cona-induced hepatitis model, we measured by using the classical reitman-frankel method the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase, serum total bilirubin  and serum lactate dehydrogenase . see details in table  <dig> 

Δcompared with control, p <  <dig> , *compared with  <dig> h, p <  <dig> 

the serum markers of liver injury, such as alt, ast, stb and ldh, increased with time after cona injection. compared with normal control, alt and stb increased at  <dig> h by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold respectively, and alt, ast, stb and ldh level at  <dig> h increased by  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively.

genes screened by gene-chip study
genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the liver has demonstrated that extensive gene expression occurs during very early-stage fulminant hepatitis. to investigate the possible gene expression change in our cona-induced hepatitis model at a very early stage, we performed a gene chip study by using the affymetrix probe dataset which includes totally  <dig> probes. we found when compared with probes in the control group,  <dig> probes increased and  <dig> probes decreased in the  <dig> h group,  <dig> probes increased and  <dig> probes decreased in the  <dig> h group, and  <dig> probes increased and  <dig> probes decreased in the  <dig> h group. our data indicate that by time after cona injection more and more gene expression is detectable. the in detail gene expression data are also available at the geo website under accession number gse17184: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/

genes further screened by anova and model profile analysis
anova corrected with the randomized variance model was performed to determine genes that were expressed separately and differentially. as a result, total  <dig>  genes that had a p-value and the false discovery rate  less than  <dig>  were declared to be significantly expressed. the gene expression value per group was the geometric mean of the robust multichip average  normalized gene signals of  <dig> samples per time point.

to further narrow the target genes which harbor great significance among the declared  <dig>  genes, we chose to use the twenty-six model profiles to summarize the expression pattern of the genes. as shown in figure  <dig>  among the  <dig> patterns, we identified  <dig> patterns of genes that shown very significant p-values .

among these patterns, the two most significant patterns were profiles no.  <dig> and no. <dig> according to ascending p-values. while the profile no.  <dig> contained  <dig> genes whose expression increased constantly, the profile no.  <dig> contained  <dig> genes whose expression reduced constantly, after cona injection .

 <dig> genes identified by gene co-expression network with k-core algorithm from profiles no. <dig> and no. 16
genes in profiles no. <dig> and no. <dig> were then analyzed and identified by gene co-expression network with k-core algorithm to determine which gene or genes may play pivotal role in the early stage of fulminant hepatitis. gene networks are constructed from functional gene associations. in the network, cycle nodes represent genes, and edges between two nodes represent interactions between genes, which were quantified by degree. degrees within the network which describe the number of single gene that regulates other genes represent the size of the cycle node. the higher the degree, the more central the gene occurs within the network. the clustering coefficient can be used to estimate the complexity of interactions among genes that neighbor the core gene with the exception of core gene participation. the lower the clustering coefficient, the more independent of the core gene are the interactions among genes in the neighborhood of the core gene <cit> .

a k-core of a gene co-expression network usually contains cohesive groups of genes. on the other hand, phylogenetic analysis classifies genes into groups based on the similarity of base sequences <cit> .

the k-core subnetwork with higher k-core level in our result is considered to have a core status within a large-scale gene network made up of differential  <dig> genes . most of the genes are attributed to transport, transcription, regulation of transcription, metabolic processes, and carbohydrate metabolic processes, consistent with the gene ontology hierarchical category, lipoprotein catabolic processes, peptide biosynthetic processes, positive regulation of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, fructosamine metabolic processes, male sex differentiation, and regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. the core genes mpdz and acsl <dig> appear at the center of both the large-scale network and the  <dig> k-core subnetwork. they directly regulate  <dig> neighboring genes that interact according to their degrees. these interactions depend in large part on mpdz and acsl <dig> because the clustering coefficients of these genes are  <dig>  and  <dig> , which are lower than for other genes.

degrees describe the number of single gene that regulates other genes represent the size of the cycle node. the higher the degree, the more central the gene occurs within the network. the clustering coefficient can be used to estimate the complexity of interactions among genes that neighbor the core gene with the exception of core gene participation. the lower the clustering coefficients, the more independent of the core gene are the interactions among genes in the neighborhood of the core gene. a k-core of a gene co-expression network usually contains cohesive groups of genes. the higher the k-core, the more central the genes occurs within the network. in this study, the top k-value is  <dig>  which is considered to have a core status within a large-scale gene network made up of differential genes from profiles no. <dig> and no.  <dig> 

in this network, transmembrane proteins, such as mpdz and acsl <dig>  were shown to play a role in the important processes of cell adhesion, carbohydrate metabolism and molecular transport. however, mpdz expression constantly decreased over the four time points. it may contribute to damage to cell junctions in liver cells. the result of mpdz down expression may be related to disorders of liver tissue and may lead to obstacles in the carbohydrate metabolic process. acs <dig> was an essential gene that was associated with long-chain-fatty-acid-coa synthase activity. the under expression of the gene gives rise to a series of obstructions in lipid and cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes.

real-time rt-pcr verification of the genes
real-time rt-pcr was used to confirm the expression of the  <dig> genes. compared with normal controls, the expression of most of the  <dig> genes showed a statistical significant change . expressions of pard <dig>  aldh8a <dig>  cmtm <dig> and fbxo <dig> were also higher than those of normal controls, but there was no statistical significance  .

discussion
in this study, use of a fulminant hepatitis mouse model, we have focused on hepatic gene expression during early stages of fulminant hepatitis. by a series of biological and bioinformatics analysis, we identified  <dig> genes whose expression are significantly altered at the very early stage and have shown big correlations with fulminant hepatitis.

using gene chips has the advantage of generating huge amounts of information. the high cost of microarray experiments and limited sample availability resulted in a small sample size for each treatment group. in addition, because we had to filter differential genes, our two-group comparison accuracy was reduced because variance estimates have few degrees of freedom. consequently, we obtained results with more power and less variation by using the random variance model corrected standard t-test or anova methodology  <cit> .

we predefined certain sets of profiles in the context of patterns that can be expected in the course of growth. on account of the noise and the small number of points for each gene, any one pattern will be shared by many genes and can be expected to appear by chance. first, we selected a set of potential expression profiles. these sets of profiles cover all of the possible profiles that can be generated by gene expression in the course of growth, and each represents a single temporal expression pattern. enrichment of genes in each profile was then used to measure the profile significance level. significant profiles may indicate that there were mostly common functions attributed to genes that are co-expressed. such functions mainly influence the biological character  <cit> .

in biological processes, macromolecular networks can be constructed by the experience results from such as y-2h, and coimmunoprecipitation, or from the algorithmic predict base on the gene function correlation and expression profiles. because of the flexibility of the network model base on the algorithmic predict from high throughput gene expression tests, we can look at snapshots of protein-protein interaction, gene expression regulatory networks and metabolism networks among different groups. the intrinsic gene networks of a phenotype can represent gene function propriety of sample. k-cores and degrees of genes are key attributes in the network. a k-core of a network is a subgraph in which all genes are connected to at least k other genes in the subgraph  <cit> . in a protein-protein interaction network, a node represents a protein and an edge represents an interaction between proteins. in this work, we use k-cores of protein-protein interaction networks to define main gene function in main subgraph. the rank of k-core value describes the complexity of gene association relationship. the complexity of gene relationship increased with k-core value rank. we wanted to find main gene ontology  assigned by the maximum numbers of genes in separately k-core and then define the key gene functions at each complexity level of network  <cit> . for this analysis result, we conclude the core functions at the core status of network which have a top k-core level.

regulation of gene expression as well as protein-protein interactions can change in a dynamic process over time. such processes may exhibit a regulatory character. these macromolecular networks respond to the events such as growth, metabolism, and apoptosis. because certain gene interactions are only observable under very specific conditions, we combined experimental data to model co-expression networks from different types of experiments. one of the important reasons for doing this was the fact that differential macromolecular network structures have different sources. in this study, twenty-six genes were selected using the network, and validated by real-time rt-pcr. compared with normal controls, the expression of most of the  <dig> genes appeared a statistical significant change .

a very important issue about the results from a gene-chip-based analysis is their correlation to the actual biological processes. many of the  <dig> genes identified in this study including mpdz and acsl <dig> are involved in the metabolism of liver cells. although the expression of these genes may not be specifically initiated or suppressed by fulminant hepatitis, the emergence or inhibition of the genes at the very early stage of fulminant hepatitis could be followed by severe liver damage, the pathological hallmark of fulminant hepatitis presented as large area of necrosis, thereby supplying potential diagnostic information for clinical fulminant hepatitis. in this study, we employed a cona-induced animal fulminant hepatitis model instead of the use of human tissue which is extremely tough to obtain. as mentioned earlier, cona-induced hepatitis has broadly been used as an experimental model of immune-mediated liver disease. our pathological and biochemical data further confirmed that the model resembles very much the human fulminant hepatitis. therefore, our results may provide important referential merit for clinical investigation. nevertheless, in all conscience, the genes identified here are required to be further dissected and confirmed in human by other clinic-related studies.

CONCLUSIONS
at the early stages of fulminant hepatitis induced by cona, expression of twenty-six genes involved in protein transport, transcription regulation and cell metabolism altered significantly. these genes form a network and have shown strong correlation with fulminant hepatitis development and a promising future for early diagnosis. our study provides several potential targets for the early diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis in clinical scenario.
