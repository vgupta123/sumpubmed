BACKGROUND
nuclear receptors constitute a large superfamily of transcription regulators. they are involved in a vast array of diverse physiological functions such as the control of embryonic development, the regulation of cell differentiation, and the maintenance of homeostasis. nuclear receptors interact with cofactors and hormone response elements  on target genes and function either as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers  <cit> . often, transcriptional regulation by nuclear receptors is dependent upon binding of receptor ligands, which typically consists of small, lipoidal molecules such as steroids and retinoids. however, for some receptors  regulatory ligands are not known or may not exist  <cit> .

nuclear receptors are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are divided into seven distinct subfamilies  <cit>  and contain a characteristic modular structure  <cit>  . the a/b domains contain a transcriptional activation function . the length of these domains is highly variable among nuclear receptors with very little evolutionary conservation. the c or dna-binding domain  is the most conserved among the nuclear receptor domains. the dbd contains two typical cysteine-rich zinc finger motifs in tandem spanning ~ <dig> amino acids which are directly involved in hre recognition. the d domain functions as a hinge between the dbd and the ligand-binding domain . the lbd or e domain contains a hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket, which is specific to each receptor and is the source of the sequence variability within the lbd. in addition, the e domain mediates dimerization and ligand dependent transcriptional activation functions   <cit> . the c-terminal contains the f-domain, which is not present in all nrs and is highly diverse.

comparative studies into functional conservation of genes and genomes will provide information on genetic diversity and similarities among major groups of organisms and give insight into protein family expansions  <cit> . nuclear receptors have undergone many gene duplication events during metazoan evolution  <cit> . the estimated number of nuclear receptors is  <dig> in homo sapiens,  <dig> in drosophila melanogaster, and over  <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . this diversity makes nuclear receptors ideal candidates for investigating the functional roles of gene duplications and phylogenetic reconstructions  <cit>  and highlights the need to expand the repertoire of species for which nuclear receptors have been characterized.

daphnia pulex, is the first crustacean for which the genome has been fully sequenced. d. pulex is used extensively in research studies in the fields of ecology, evolution, development, toxicology, and genetics. the recent release of the genome makes it a useful addition to the growing list of sequenced genomes for comparative evolutionary genomic research  <cit> . the aims of this study were to identify and annotate all of the nuclear receptors that are present in the d. pulex genome, to assess evolutionary conservation, divergence, or emergence of the crustacean receptors using phylogenetic comparison to the nuclear receptors of a vertebrate h. sapiens, an insect d. melanogaster, and a nematode c. elegans, and to evaluate the expression of these receptors in parthenogenetically reproducing females.

RESULTS
nuclear receptor genes
twenty-five putative full-length nuclear receptor genes were identified in the d. pulex genome. all  <dig> genes were identified based upon the presence of a conserved dbd. subsequent blast searching of the wfleabase database http://wfleabase.org with each of the h. sapiens and d. melanogaster nuclear receptors, listed in additional file  <dig>  revealed no additional nuclear receptor sequences. fifteen of the nuclear receptor subfamilies consist of single copy genes; two subfamilies  have two paralogs each; and, two subfamilies  have three paralogs each. dappu-ecra/dappu-ecrb , dappu-hr97a/dappu-hr97b  and dappu-knr-r1/dappu-knr-r <dig>  were found in close proximity as tandem repeats.

the d. pulex nuclear receptor family contains members that represent each of the seven subfamilies of receptors . there are  <dig> members of the nr <dig> nuclear receptor family in d. pulex, which makes up 52% of the total number of nuclear receptors. in comparison,  <dig> out of  <dig> receptors  of d. melanogaster are nr <dig> members. the expansion of the nr <dig> family is the result of the existence of the dappu-hr <dig> and dappu-hr <dig> receptors, an additional dappu-ecr receptor, and the three dappu-hr <dig> receptors in d. pulex. there are also  <dig> nr <dig> members,  <dig> nr <dig> members, and one member each of the nr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nuclear receptor subfamilies. annotated gene and protein sequences, and d. pulex genome browser links for the  <dig> receptors are provided in additional file  <dig>

known receptor members for each nuclear receptor subfamily group are listed and compared to corresponding d. pulex nuclear receptors, including manual annotated protein identification number  and scaffold identity. receptor group designations are based upon nomenclature adopted by the nuclear receptors nomenclature committee  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
phylogenetic analyses were performed using the amino acid sequences from the dna and ligand binding domains and trees were constructed using three different approaches: bayesian inference, maximum parsimony, and protein distance ). different models gave similar results at the group and subfamily levels, but bayesian inference showed greater resolution at the base of the phylogram. results generated from bayesian inference are presented along with the bootstrap values from maximum parsimony and nj . an expandable pdf file of the phylogram is available as additional file  <dig>  and a phylogram from a tree constructed from full length nuclear receptors is provided as additional file  <dig>  the full length phylogram showed much poorer resolution compared to the dbd/lbd-only phylogram, especially at the left hand nodes .

the d. pulex nuclear receptor phylogenetic tree segregates into four major clades  each further dividing into several sub-clades. the nr3/5/ <dig> clade further subdivides into the nr <dig> and nr5/ <dig> subclades. the nr <dig> clade divides into two distinct subclades, and the nr <dig> clade divides into at least two distinct subclades. differences between the three methods of tree construction were observed. in general, maximum parsimony provided the least resolution at the base of the tree.

significant differences among the phylogenetic trees are as follows. the nj tree placed dappu-hr <dig> in the nr1a/b groups of the nr <dig> clade. however, no other trees including the full length trees segregated dappu-hr <dig> or dappu-hr <dig> into any of the nr <dig> groups; only as nr <dig> subfamily members. dappu-hr <dig> and dappu-hr <dig> may be sufficiently distinct from the other clade members to warrant distinct group designations . the nj tree also predicts that dappu-ecra is more closely related to dmecr than to dappu-ecrb. there is also disagreement among trees with respect to fxr's place within the nr1h group.

the knirps that lack a lbd  group within the nr <dig> clade. it is not surprising that the nr <dig> subfamily members fit within other clades as the nr <dig> subfamily was derived to accommodate nuclear receptors that lack either the lbd or the dbd, independent of phylogenetics  <cit> . for example, the mammalian nr0b members that all lack a dna binding domain, were assigned to the nr <dig> clade. in the maximum parisimony and nj trees, the knirps, nr1i, and nr1l groups form their own subclade, but in the bayesian tree, these groups are separate, but within the nr1c-f groups. the exact relationship of each of the knirps to each other is also contentious as nj and maximum parsimony suggest the presence of a knrl and an egon in d. pulex, but do not agree as to the exact identity of each. bayesian inference suggests that the knirps of d. pulex and the knirps of d. melanogaster are more closely related to each other and thus duplication of the knirps occurred after the divergence of insects and crustaceans. analysis of the full length receptors suggests that dmegon is orthologous to dappu-knr-r <dig> and dmknr is orthologous to dappu-knr-r <dig>  because of the vast disagreement among methods, we named the d. pulex receptors dappu-knr-r <dig> and dappu-knr-r <dig> for knr related  <dig> and  <dig> 

there are few differences among the trees as they relate to the d. pulex nr <dig> receptors. for example, in the nj tree, dappu-hnf <dig> is not as closely related to dmhnf <dig>  but instead branches from an ancestral precursor to all of the nr2a group members. similarly dmusp segregates from all of the rxr genes, including dappu-rxr in the nj and maximum parsimony trees. the placement of dmfax <dig> and cefax <dig> is also contentious, but this was not related to any of the d. pulex receptors. lastly, the placement of dappu-hr <dig> differs between the three trees. the bayesian tree shows dappu-hr <dig> as members of the nr2d group. however, the nj tree places dappu-hr <dig> in the nr2c group, while dmhr <dig> and cenhr <dig> are 2d members. the maximum parisimony tree has all five members related with the cenhr <dig> as the most distal member. clearly, the nr2c and 2d groups are related .

there were no significant differences in the nr <dig>  nr <dig>  nr <dig>  or nr <dig> subfamilies in the trees related to d. pulex receptors. the nr <dig> subfamily only showed one difference because the nj tree did not agree with the other trees as to the placement of the androgen receptor. the nr <dig> subfamily also only showed one difference between the trees and that was related to the relationship of ceodr <dig> to the rest of the nr <dig> subfamily. all of the trees were in agreement as it related to the nr <dig> subfamily, and the only difference in the nr <dig> subfamily was due to the positioning of the cenhr <dig> in the maximum parsimony tree.

overall, the d. pulex nuclear receptor genes are distinctly placed within  <dig> subclades or groups based upon the phylogenetic tree  and are named in agreement with the unified nomenclature system for nuclear receptors  <cit>  . seven of these groups also were represented in d. melanogaster, c. elegans, and h. sapiens . the ubiquity of these groups among protostomes and deuterostomes suggests that these receptor groups evolved prior to the protostome/deuterostome divergence. two of these groups are represented in d. pulex and d. melanogaster but not in h. sapiens . representatives from these groups are also absent among the nuclear receptors of other sequenced vertebrates, including mammals and the teleost, fugu rubripes  <cit>  and may represent groups that emerged within some protostome lineage after the protostome/deuterostome divergence.

expression of nuclear receptor mrnas
individual nuclear receptors were evaluated for the transcription of mrna using pcr with receptor-specific primers . rna isolated from whole homogenates of adult female, parthenogenetically reproducing d. pulex yielded mrna species that corresponded to  <dig> of the  <dig> receptors . all amplicons were of the molecular mass derived from the predicted mrna sequences and nucleotide sequencing of the amplicons confirmed identity of the gene products . thus, at least  <dig> of the identified receptor genes are functional.

we were unable to generate amplicons using various primer sets designed to amplify the products of the genes dappu-ecrb, dappu-tll, dappu-pnr, and dappu-dsf. however, ecrb transcript is present within the est libraries reported by the daphnia genomics consortium https://dgc.cgb.indiana.edu/display/daphnia/cdna+sequencing+project. dappu-tll, dappu-pnr, and dappu-dsf transcripts are not present in these libraries. efforts to detect the nr2e group members are ongoing. in d. melanogaster, nr2e group members function in embryonic development, sexual behavior, and sex-specific neuronal development  <cit> . we cannot exclude the possibility that these genes are not expressed in mature, parthenogenetically reproducing females, but would be expressed during specific stages of embryo development, in sexually reproducing females, or in male daphnids.

nuclear receptors of d. pulex
nr <dig> subfamily
the d. pulex genome contains two nuclear receptors that bear similarity to the d. melanogaster knirp receptors knrl and egon . both of the d. pulex knirps lack lbds which is characteristic of the nr0a group  <cit> . nr0a group members were previously known to exist only in insects  <cit> . the odr <dig> receptor of c. elegans is also a member of the nr0a group, based not upon its phylogenetic relatedness to other group member, but because it lacks a lbd  <cit> . odr <dig> phylogenetically groups best with the nr <dig> members . because direct orthology cannot be assigned, the d. pulex knirps were named dappu-knr-r <dig> and dappu-knr-r <dig> 

the dappu-knr-r <dig> and dappu-knr-r <dig> receptors share 62% identity to each other at the 5' end . the 3' ends of the two receptors share little similarity. d. melanogaster knrl possesses a  <dig> amino acid kni-box motif located adjacent to the zinc fingers  <cit> . this motif is fully conserved in dappu-knr-r <dig> and in  <dig> out of  <dig> amino acids in dappu-knr-r <dig>  in d. melanogaster, knrl and egon contribute to the orchestration of embryogenesis and cell fate  <cit> . no nr0b members were identified in d. pulex based upon similarity to the vertebrate nuclear receptors shp or dax <dig> 

nr <dig> subfamily
the nr <dig> subfamily comprises the largest subfamily of nuclear receptors found in d. pulex with thirteen members. two of the members did not associate with specific nr <dig> groups and were named dappu-hr <dig> and dappu-hr <dig> ; the first number marking the family designation and the second number assigned in order. dappu-hr <dig> shows similarity to rar-like receptors from lower vertebrates in blast comparisons. this receptor segregated into the nr <dig> clade during phylogenetic analyses but displayed little identity with any of the nr group members and was therefore assigned to a new nr <dig> group, nr1m . dappu-hr <dig> shares 60% identity with the dbd and 36% with the lbd of the sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus spthr  <cit> . the dbd of dappu-hr <dig> shows similarity to human thr receptors in blast comparisons; however, little phylogenetic similarity exists between these receptors. accordingly, dappu-hr <dig> is tenuously assigned to its own group, nr1n .

d. pulex possesses a single receptor of the nr1d group designated dappu-e <dig> based upon its similarity to the e <dig> receptor of d. melanogaster . e <dig> previously has been identified in a decapod crustacean  <cit> . a nr1d member is also evident in c. elegans and was earlier designated as nhr- <dig>  e <dig> is induced by ecdysteroids and juvenoids in insects and functions in larval molting and metamorphosis  <cit> .

insect e <dig> serves as a dimerization partner to hr <dig>  an nr1f member, and in doing so, represses its action. e <dig> also accommodates heme and has the ability to bind small signalling molecules such as nitric oxide  and carbon monoxide  via this heme moiety  <cit> . intracellular no/co binding inhibits the interaction of e <dig> with hr <dig>  thus, e <dig> suppresses the action of hr <dig> in a no/co permissive fashion  <cit> . hr <dig> was previously cloned from the lobster homarus americanus and d. pulex is therefore the second crustacean species shown to possess this nr1f group member  <cit> . in insects  <cit>  and lobsters  <cit> , hr <dig> is induced by ecdysteroids and studies in insects have shown that hr <dig> mediates certain development-specific responses to ecdysteroid pulses. nr1f is represented by ror in vertebrates and chr <dig>  in c. elegans  <cit> .

the nr1e group was established to accommodate another rev-erb homolog initially described in insects and designated e <dig> . d. pulex is the first non-insect that has been shown to possess this receptor gene. like e <dig>  insect e <dig> is ecdysteroid inducible and appears to contribute to the orchestration of development  <cit> . a function for e <dig> in crustaceans has not yet been established.

analysis of the d. pulex genome revealed the presence of two ecdysteroid receptors, dappu-ecra and dappu-ecrb, belonging to the nr1h group . both receptors share an overall identity of 60% at the amino acid level and 81% and 78% similarity between their dbd and their lbd, respectively. upon activation by ecdysteroids, ecr regulates embryo development and molting in daphnids  <cit> . interestingly, ecr has not been identified in roundworms though these organisms reportedly respond to ecdysteroid treatment  <cit> . nr1h group members in vertebrates include lxr and fxr.

the daphnid genome contained one nuclear receptor with significant homology to insect hr <dig>  this receptor was assigned to the nr1j group and was designated dappu-hr <dig>  this represents the first identification of a nr1j group member in a crustacean. dappu-hr <dig> contains the conserved  <dig> sequential amino acid residues and the base-contact residues esckaffr, that are unique among all nr1j group members  <cit> . the nr1j group appears to be unique to ecdysozoans but the dbd shares similarity with the dbd of the vertebrate vdr . previous phylogenetic analysis has indicated that the the nr1i and nr1j groups share a common receptor ancestor but diverged between the deuterostomes  and the protostomes   <cit> . little is known of the function of hr <dig> receptors in ecdysozoans. however, recent studies revealed that dhr <dig> might play a role in xenobiotic stress responses in d. melanogaster  <cit> . additionally, daf- <dig>  a nr1j member in c. elegans has been implicated in diapause  <cit> .

receptor gene identification and accompanying phylogenetic analyses revealed that d. pulex possesses a unique group of nuclear receptors consisting of three genes that share sequence similarities with hr <dig> and to a lesser extent vdr. these receptors have been tentatively provided the group designation nr1l and the receptor names dappu-hr97a, dappu-hr97b, and dappu-hr97g . dappu-hr97a and dappu-hr97b are tandem duplicated genes with a dbd and lbd that are 100% and 78% identical, respectively. phylogenetic analyses  suggest that the ancestral dappu-hr97a/b was derived from the duplication of the hr97g gene. both dappu-hr97a and dappu-hr97b lack a conserved intron found within dappu-hr97g, dhr <dig>  and dappu-hr <dig>  the gt/ag sites that are required to form this intron are absent from dappu-hr97b, but not dappu-hr97a. however, this potential intron is not excised from the expressed dappu-hr97a mrna . at the amino acid level, dappu-hr97a and dappu-hr97g are 41% identical, with a 63% and 45% identity between their dbd and lbd respectively. dappu-hr97g contains the same conserved base-contact residues  found in all nr1j members  while dappu-hr97a and dappu-hr97b have one amino acid difference. the dbd/lbd domains and full-length proteins of each of the dappu-hr <dig> receptors cluster within the hr96/daf12/nr0a group; however, dappu-hr <dig> comprises its own subclade resulting in its unique group designation.

the function of the dappu-hr97s is not known. the similarity of its lbds to hr <dig> and the nr1i subfamily suggests a role as a xenobiotic or endobiotic sensor. in contrast, the similarity of the dbd to the nr0a members  suggests a role in development. it is interesting to speculate that the dappu-hr97s may play a role in mediating developmental and life-stage changes such as male offspring and diapause egg production that are mediated by environmental cues.

nr <dig> subfamily
the d. pulex genome contains a single member of the nr2a group that has been designated dappu-hnf <dig> due to its similarity to hnf <dig> in h. sapiens and d. melanogaster . an hnf <dig> ortholog in c. elegans is known as nhr <dig>  dappu-hnf <dig> is the first nr2a member to be described in a crustacean. dappu-hnf <dig> possesses the p-box sequence dgckg, which is characteristic of members in this group  <cit> . expression patterning and gene deletion experiments in d. melanogaster indicate that hnf <dig> is involved in orchestrating the development of components of the digestive system  <cit> .

rxr, a nr2b group member, is represented in the d. pulex genome and has been designated dappu-rxr . this receptor has been cloned previously from crustaceans including d. magna  <cit> . rxr is ubiquitous among the bilateria with the notable exception of c. elegans  <cit> . this gene is best recognized in insects as the partner to ecr. retinoids, most notably 9-cis-retinoic acid, serve as a high affinity ligand to rxr in vertebrates  <cit>  and molluscs  <cit> . terpenes such as juvenile hormone and methyl farnesoate have been proposed as ligands to insect and crustacean rxr  <cit> .

the nr2c and nr2d groups represent different groupings within related subclades . the d. pulex genome contains one member of this clade that we have designated dappu-hr <dig>  dappu-hr <dig> shows greater phylogenetic relation to the nr2d members from d. melanogaster  and c. elegans , than to the nr2c members from h. sapiens, tr <dig> and tr <dig>  numerous nr2c/d orthologs have been identified in a variety of species. in vertebrates, tr <dig> and tr <dig> have diverse functions and are able to either activate or repress target genes  <cit> . recent studies suggest that tr2/ <dig> might play a role in sequential, gene-autonomous silencing of the e and g -globin genes during development  <cit> . the function of hr <dig> in arthropods is still unknown but it has been shown to be induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone and to inhibit the transcriptional activity of ecr in a reporter gene assay  <cit> . dappu-hr <dig> represents the first nr2c/d member identified in a crustacean.

the d. pulex genome possesses three receptor genes from the nr2e group . dappu-tll is a homolog to tll of d. melanogaster and tlx of h. sapiens. dappu-pnr is a homolog to pnr of insects and vertebrates. dappu-dsf is a homolog to dsf in d. melanogaster . the nr2e group members are important in aspects of neural and optic development in both insects and vertebrates and appear to be ubiquitous among the bilateria  <cit> . two receptors, fax- <dig> and cenhr <dig> are found in c. elegans  <cit> . the daphnid nr2e members possess the unique structural features of other nr2e genes including a very short a/b domain and a characteristic p box sequence   <cit> . a nr2f group member that is homologous to svp in d. melanogaster and coup-tf in vertebrates is represented in the d. pulex genome as dappu-svp . dappu-svp possesses two dbds which is characteristic of nr2f members based upon the conserved domain database   <cit> . this is the first report of a nr2f receptor gene in a crustacean. coup-tf in vertebrates and svp in insects have been shown to be potent transcriptional suppressors that negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of other nuclear receptors such as ecr, rar, vdr, tr, and hnf <dig>  <cit> .

nr <dig> subfamily
the nr3b group is represented by a single gene in the d. pulex genome designated dappu-err . estrogen-related receptors  are ubiquitous among metazoans including trichoplax  <cit>  a basal metazoan  <cit> . yet, aside from known importance in placental development, little is known about its function  <cit> . recent studies suggest that err could be part of the estrogen signalling and metabolism pathway  <cit> .

nr <dig> subfamily
a single gene in the d. pulex genome represents the nr4a group and is designated dappu-hr <dig> . this group is ubiquitous among the bilateria and homologs include ngfib, nurr <dig>  and nor- <dig> in vertebrates; hr <dig> in insects; nhr <dig> in c. elegans , and nr4a <dig> in schistoma mansoni  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, dhr <dig> plays an important role in cuticle formation and is induced by ecdysteroids  <cit> . hr <dig> may be a true orphan receptor since its 3d structure revealed no ligand-binding pocket and coactivator-binding site. these unique features seem to be conserved in vertebrate ngfib members and might indicate similar biological functionalities  <cit> .

nr <dig> subfamily
d. pulex contains two genes in the nr <dig> subfamily, designated dappu-ftz-f <dig>  and dappu-hr <dig>  . dappu-ftz-f <dig> is highly conserved among the bilateria  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, ftz-f <dig> orchestrates stage-specific responses to ecdysteroids  <cit> . two nr5a nuclear receptors are present in mammals, sf <dig> and lrh <dig>  sf <dig> is a transcription factor for genes involved in reproductive physiology and endocrine functions  <cit> , while lrh <dig> regulates genes important for cholesterol metabolism  <cit> . dappu-ftz-f <dig> possesses a sequence that is highly conserved in all nr5a members called the ftz-f <dig> box  which is located immediately after the dbd and plays an important role in the high affinity interactions of the receptor with dna  <cit> .

bolded amino acids indicate differences from dappu-ftz-f <dig>  amino acid sequences were derived from  <cit> .

nr5b previously was known to exist only in insects as hr <dig>  the revelation that this group exists in crustaceans suggests that this group emerged in arthropod evolution prior to the divergence of insects and crustaceans. the function of the nr5b gene product in arthropods is unknown. sequence similarities between ftz-f <dig> and hr <dig> suggest that nr5b in arthropods is the result of a duplication and subsequent divergence of the nr5a receptor  <cit> .

nr <dig> subfamily
the d. pulex genome contains a nuclear receptor gene bearing significant homology to the nr6a members dhr <dig> in d. melanogaster, gcnf in h. sapiens, and nhr <dig> in c. elegans. this is the first report of an nr6a group member in a crustacean. expression patterns of dhr <dig> in d. melanogaster, suggest that this receptor is regulated by ecdysteroids and may play a role in the molting process  <cit> . dhr <dig> can act as a repressor or an inducer while coordinating growth and maturation in d. melanogaster  <cit> . in vertebrates gcnf contributes to the regulation of embryonic development, reproduction, and neurogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
thus far,  <dig> nuclear receptor genes have been identified in d. pulex. eighteen receptors are present as a single copy gene in the d. pulex genome. one receptor  contains three paralogs based upon phylogenetic analysis, of which two are in tandem repeat. two receptor genes are present with two paralogs . all of the nuclear receptor groups that are present in d. melanogaster are also represented in d. pulex. this observation indicates that these receptor groups emerged prior to the divergence of the insecta and crustacea. . this conclusion is substantiated by the presence of these receptor groups in either of the non-arthropod species h. sapiens or c. elegans . at least two novel receptor groups were discovered in the d. pulex genome designated nr1l , nr1m , and potentially nr1n , which may be have orthologs in the sea urchin and also shows significant similarity to nr1a/b group members using some distance methods. the nr1l and nr1m groups were not represented in any of the other genomes used in the phylogenetic comparisons and may represent receptor groups that emerged among the crustaceans subsequent to divergence from the insects.

while d. pulex possesses two members of the nr0a group, knr-r <dig> and knr-r <dig>  d. melanogaster contains three distinct members, knrl, kni and egon. the absence of kni in d. pulex might indicate that this nr0a group member is a product of gene duplication that occurred in insects after the divergence of insects and crustaceans or was lost in d. pulex and potentially other crustaceans.

nuclear receptors are ancient proteins that have ubiquitous important functions in regulating many aspects of metazoan physiology. biological functions have been established and ligands identified for some of the receptors. however, the function of many of these family members remains elusive. daphnids have a long history of use as a model organism in studies of ecology, toxicology, and evolutionary biology. the elucidation of the d. pulex genome creates an invaluable resource to study the functional role of specific genes in the well-characterized physiology of this organism. the identification of the nuclear receptor genes in d. pulex was the first step to gain more insight into the evolutionary and structural aspects of these important transcription factors. the foundation is now established to link specific nuclear receptors with physiological function.
