BACKGROUND
the productivity of over one-third of the arable land in the world is affected by the salinity of the soil
 <cit> . more than  <dig> million ha of land worldwide are salt-affected
 <cit> . high salinity adversely affects plant growth and development by disturbing intracellular ion homeostasis, which results in membrane dysfunction, attenuation of metabolic activity and secondary effects that inhibit growth and induce cell death
 <cit> . nearly all enzyme activity is reduced severely at nacl concentrations above  <dig>  m because of disruption of the electrostatic forces that maintain protein structure
 <cit> . nacl stress also significantly damages photosynthetic mechanisms through a combination of superoxide and h2o2-mediated oxidation
 <cit> . plants adapt to environmental stresses via a plethora of responses, including the activation of molecular networks that regulate stress perception, signal transduction and the expression of both stress-related genes and metabolites. plants have stress-specific adaptive responses as well as responses which protect the plants from more than one environmental stress
 <cit> . numerous abiotic stress-related genes, as well as some transcription factors and regulatory sequences in plant promoters, have been characterised
 <cit> . plants employ three different strategies to prevent and adapt to high na+ concentrations: 1) active na+ efflux, 2) na+ compartmentalisation in vacuoles, and 3) na+ influx prevention
 <cit> . antiporters are an important group of genes that play a pivotal role in ion homeostasis in plants. na+/h+ antiporters  maintain the appropriate concentration of ions in the cytosol, thereby minimising cytotoxicity. nhx <dig> are located in tonoplasts and reduce cytosolic na+ concentration by pumping in the vacuole
 <cit> , whereas sos <dig> is localised at the plasma membrane and extrudes na+ in apoplasts
 <cit> . both of these antiporters are driven by the proton motive force generated by the h+-atpase
 <cit> .

the discovery of, and pioneer studies on, sos mutants in arabidopsis uncovered a new pathway for ion homeostasis that promotes tolerance to salt stress. the sos mutants were specifically hypersensitive to high external concentrations of na+ or li+ and were unable to grow at low external k+ concentrations
 <cit> . the sos pathway consists of three proteins: sos <dig>  a calcium sensor protein
 <cit> ; sos <dig>  a serine/threonine protein kinase
 <cit> ; and sos1
 <cit> . during salt stress, cellular ca2+ levels are altered and cipk and cbl interacting proteins are activated. calcineurin b-like proteins  participate in salt stress-mediated signal transduction to control the influx and efflux of na+ <cit> . the calcineurin b-like  ca2+ sensor sos <dig>  has been cloned from arabidopsis <cit> . sos <dig> interacts with and activates the serine/threonine protein kinase sos2
 <cit> . this interaction has been reported to recruit sos <dig> to the plasma membrane where it interacts with sos1
 <cit> . the a. thaliana sos <dig> gene was ectopically expressed for the first time in arabidopsis and reduced the accumulation of na+ in the presence of salt stress
 <cit> . similar results were obtained when sod <dig> and nhaa, which are plasma membrane na+/h+ antiporters from schizosaccharomyces pombe and escherichia coli, respectively, were overexpressed in arabidopsis <cit>  and rice
 <cit> . heterologous expression of different plant sos <dig> genes suppressed the na+ sensitivity of the yeast mutant  . additionally, wu et al.
 <cit>  and garciadeblas et al.
 <cit>  showed that expression of pesos <dig> and cnsos <dig> partially suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotypes of the ep <dig> bacterial strain , which lacks activity of the two na+/h+ antiporters ecnhaa and ecnhab.

few studies have performed in planta overexpression of the sos <dig> gene from arabidopsis <cit> , thellungiella <cit>  and puccinellia tenuiflora <cit> . the study of the salt tolerance mechanisms of halophytic plants has emerged as an important area because these species are well-adapted to and can overcome soil salinity more efficiently than glycophytic plants
 <cit> . our lab studies an extreme halophyte, salicornia brachiata roxb. , in an effort to identify and characterise novel genes that enable salt tolerance. s. brachiata, a leafless succulent annual halophyte, commonly grows in the gujarat coastal marshes in india. salicornia can grow in a wide range of salt concentrations  and can accumulate quantities of salt as high as 40% of its dry weight. this unique characteristic provides an advantage for the study of salt tolerance mechanisms. salicornia accumulates salt in the pith region, which reflects the fact that antiporter genes are necessary to maintain homeostasis in extreme salinity. this report describes the isolation of the sbsos <dig> gene from s. brachiata and overexpression in tobacco plant for functional validation.

methods
plant growth and salt treatments
salicornia brachiata roxb. seeds were collected from dried plants obtained from the coastal area near bhavnagar, gujarat, india. the seeds were germinated in plastic pots containing garden soil and the plants were grown in natural conditions. at one month, the seedlings were carefully uprooted and transferred to hydroponic conditions  in a culture room with a dark/light cycle of 8/ <dig> h at 25°c for one month. the plants were treated with various concentrations of nacl  for  <dig> h. upon completion of the treatments, shoot and root tissues were separately collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°c.

cloning of sbsos <dig> gene
degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions of the sos <dig> gene. to identify conserved regions of the sos <dig> gene for pcr amplification, sos <dig> cdna sequences from arabidopsis , chenopodium quinoa , suaeda japonica , mesembryanthemum crystallinum  solanum lycopersicum , oryza sativa , and triticum aestivum  were retrieved from ncbi and aligned with the clustalw program. on the basis of sequence conservation across species, five pairs corresponding degenerate primers were designed. of these primers, df2-dr <dig> ccaaatgchtctaatgc-3’) and df5-dr <dig>  primer sets produced fragments of the desired size.

rna was extracted from the shoots of s. brachiata using the gitc method. total rna  was used in rt-pcr reactions and cdna was synthesised with a superscript rt ii first strand cdna synthesis kit . the sos <dig> gene was amplified in the presence of  <dig> pmol of the degenerate primers,  <dig>  u taq and  <dig> μl cdna according to the following sequence: initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> min, 55°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig> min, and an additional  <dig> min polymerisation step at 72°c. the amplified fragments were purified from agarose gels and cloned into the pgem-t easy vector system ii  and transformed into dh5α escherichia coli cells. after sequencing these rt-pcr fragments , four additional primers were designed to amplify the full-length cdna via rapid amplification of cdna ends .

the 5′-race reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol . the first strand of cdna was synthesised with a gene-specific primer gsp r <dig>  and superscript rt ii. the mrna was removed with rnase h, and a homopolymeric tail was added to the 3′-end of the cdna. pcr amplification was performed using a nested, gene-specific primer gsp r <dig>  and a dg-anchor primer aap  <dig> -3′).

to perform 3′-race reactions, the first strand of cdna was synthesized at the poly  mrna tail with pk <dig> oligo dt adapter primer 17-3′). following the first strand of cdna synthesis, pcr was performed with a gene-specific primer, gsp f <dig> , and an adaptor primer, pk <dig> . the 5′- and 3′-race products were cloned into a pgem-t easy vector. the cloned products of the original pcr and the 5′-and 3′-race reactions were sequenced, and contiguous sequences were assembled to obtain the full-length sbsos <dig> gene. after determining the open reading frame, the full length sos <dig> cdna was amplified with accuprime pfx dna polymerase , using sbsos f  and sbsos r  primers. the amplification product was then cloned into a pjet <dig> /blunt cloning vector  and sequenced by primer walking .

in silico analysis
the ncbi database was searched for nucleotide and protein sequences. tmpred online software was used to predict transmembrane domains, and dnaman was used to align sequences. conserved domains in sbsos <dig> were identified via the blastp program . expasy tools  was used to predict secondary structures. the relationship of sbsos <dig> with sos <dig> from other plant species was inferred by constructing phylogenetic tree using mega ver.  <dig> . the robustness in topology of the phylogenetic tree was assessed based on bootstrap value.

quantitative real time pcr
total rna was isolated from control and nacl-treated plant samples using gitc buffer and quantified with a nanodrop spectrophotometer . the cdna was prepared with  <dig> μg of total rna with a superscript rt ii first-strand cdna synthesis kit . real time qpcr was performed in a bio-rad iq <dig> detection system  with 1x sybr green . the pcr reactions were carried out in 1x pcr buffer supplemented with  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase and  <dig> pmol of each gene-specific primer. the pcr reactions were performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> sec, 60°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> sec. at the end of the pcr cycles, the products were subjected to melt curve analysis to verify the specificity of pcr amplification. the amplified products were electrophoresed through  <dig> % agarose gel to verify that they matched the predicted size. three independent experiments were performed with three replicates each. fold changes were calculated using the ct method
 <cit> , and ct values for individual variants were compared to those of a reference control . the sbsos1-specific primer pair rt f  and rt r  were utilised for expression study of sbsos <dig>  whereas qbt f  and qbt r  primers were used for an internal control.

construction of plant transformation vector and tobacco transformation
to perform plant transformation, sbsos <dig> cdna was pcr-amplified with accuprime pfx dna polymerase  in conjunction with ua f  and uk r  primers, which contained apai and kpni sites, respectively. the digested sbsos <dig> gene was cloned as an apai/ kpni fragment into the prt  <dig> vector
 <cit> . thereafter, the entire cassette containing the camv 35s constitutive promoter and both the sbsos <dig> gene and terminator were cloned into the pcambia <dig> vector at the psti site. the resulting vector was mobilised into agrobacterium tumefaciens  and used to transform tobacco  plants according to a standard protocol
 <cit> . putative transgenic plants regenerated directly from leaf edges in the presence of kanamycin  were transferred in jam bottles that contained ms basal medium
 <cit>  supplemented with kanamycin . the transgenic lines were screened via gus assay, pcr amplification and semiquantitative pcr analysis. to obtain transgenic t <dig> seedlings, seeds from the parental plants  were germinated on kanamycin-supplemented ms medium.

semiquantitative pcr analysis
total rna was isolated from wt and transgenic plant samples using gitc buffer and was quantified with a nanodrop spectrophotometer . the cdna was prepared using  <dig> μg of total rna with a superscript rt iii first-strand cdna synthesis kit . the synthesised cdna  was used as a template, and actin was used as an internal control for rt-pcr analysis. the sbsos1-specific primer pair, rt f  and rt r , was utilised for expression study of the sbsos <dig>  whereas qact f  and qact r  primers were used for actin. the pcr reactions were carried out in 1x pcr buffer supplemented with  <dig> μm dntps,  <dig>  u taq dna polymerase and  <dig> pmol of each of the gene-specific primers according to the following conditions: an initial denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> sec, 60°c for  <dig> sec and 72°c for  <dig> sec, followed by a final extension step at 72°c for  <dig> min. rt-pcr experiments were repeated three times, and the amplification products were analysed via agarose gel electrophoresis.

histochemical gus staining
gus activity was visualised in leaf tissue with  <dig> mm 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-b-d-glucuronide as was described by jefferson
 <cit> . leaves from control and transgenic plants were cut to  <dig> cm <dig> in size and rinsed in  <dig> mm phosphate buffer . leaf sections were then incubated with  <dig> mm 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-b-d-glucuronide prepared in  <dig> mm phosphate buffer, vacuum infiltrated for  <dig> min and then incubated overnight at 37°c in the dark. the tissues were then rinsed with 80% ethanol for  <dig> h to remove chlorophyll.

extraction of genomic dna and pcr analysis
genomic dna was isolated from different t <dig> lines via the ctab  method. to verify the presence of the transgene, pcr was conducted with gene-specific primers for real-time pcr  and gus-specific primers .

leaf disc assay and estimation of chlorophyll
leaf discs from wt and two t <dig> transgenic lines  were used in the salt tolerance assay. the leaf discs were floated on ¼ ms  and different concentrations of nacl for  <dig> days. the leaf discs were then homogenised thoroughly in 80% acetone and centrifuged at  <dig>  ×g for 2– <dig> min. the o.d. of each supernatant was recorded at  <dig> and  <dig> nm, and the chlorophyll content was calculated per gram of fresh tissue weight
 <cit> . the treatments were conducted under continuous exposure to white light at  <dig> ± 2°c.

evaluation of transgenic plants exposed to salt stress
to analyse the salt stress tolerance of sbsos1-overexpressing tobacco plants, the seeds from t <dig> transgenic plants were germinated in ms medium supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> mm nacl in culture room conditions. the percentage of seed germination was scored  <dig> days after seed inoculation. t <dig> seedlings were also analysed for different growth parameters under salt stress. at eight days, wt and kanamycin-positive t <dig> seedlings  were transferred to ms medium supplemented with  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl in petridish. shoot length, root length, leaf surface area, fresh weight, dry weight and relative water content  of the seedlings were measured after  <dig> days of growth. at one month, wt and kanamycin-positive t <dig> seedlings were transferred into beakers containing 1/ <dig> ms hydroponic culture and were maintained therein for  <dig> days prior to receiving stress treatments of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl. leaf, shoot and root tissues were collected  <dig> days post-treatment and subjected to physiological and biochemical analyses. for ros analysis 15-day-old wt and kanamycin-positive t <dig> seedlings were transferred to ms medium supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl in culture jars and maintained for  <dig> days.

membrane stability index 
msi was determined as described by hayat et al.
 <cit> . in brief, msi was estimated by taking leaf samples in  <dig> ml of double-distilled water in two sets. one set was heated at 40°c for  <dig> min in a water bath and measured for electrical conductivity . the second set was boiled at 100°c for  <dig> min prior to having its conductivity  measured. msi was calculated according to the formula
 <cit>  as described by sairam
 <cit> :

  msi=1−c1/c <dig> 

electrolyte leakage
electrolyte leakage was measured as described by lutts et al.
 <cit> . young leaves  of similar size were collected from four plants for each treatment and washed thoroughly with deionised water to remove surface-adhered electrolytes. the samples were placed in closed vials containing  <dig> ml of deionised water, incubated at 25°c on a rotary shaker for  <dig> h. subsequently, the electrical conductivity of the solution  was determined using a seveneasy conductivity meter . the samples were then autoclaved at 120°c for  <dig> min and cooled at 25°c before determining the final electrical conductivity . electrolyte leakage was defined as follows:

  electrolyte leakage%=lt/l0× <dig> 

lipid peroxidation
lipid peroxidation was estimated by determining the concentration of malondialdehyde  produced by the thiobarbituric acid  reaction; this experiment was performed following the method described by hodges et al.
 <cit> . leaf material  was homogenised in  <dig> ml of an 80% acetone solution. in one set,  <dig> ml of extract was added to  <dig> ml  <dig> %  tba in 20%  tca. in another set, tba was excluded. the mixture was incubated at 90°c for  <dig> min and then cooled at room temperature. the samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min and the absorbance of the supernatants at  <dig> nm,  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm was determined. the mda concentration was derived according to the following equations:

2)
  b=abs440+tba−abs600−tba <dig>  

3)
  mda equivalentsnmol gm−1=a−b/ <dig>  

in vivo localisation and quantification of o2- and h2o <dig> content in the leaves of t <dig> plants
in vivo detection of o2− and h2o <dig> was accomplished by histochemical staining with nitro blue tetrazolium  and  <dig>  3′- diaminobenzidine  as described by shi et al.
 <cit> . the presence of o2− and h2o <dig> in transgenic and wt leaves exposed to salt stress was detected by immersing the leaf samples in room temperature solutions of nbt  and dab  in  <dig> mm phosphate buffer . to detect o2−, immersed leaves were illuminated for  <dig> h until blue spots appeared, which are indicative of formazan precipitates. to determine the localisation of h2o <dig>  immersed leaves were incubated in the light at room temperature for  <dig> h until brown spots became visible; these spots occur due to the reaction of dab with h2o <dig>  following incubation, the leaf chlorophyll was bleached in absolute ethanol to enable visualisation of the blue and brown spots.

o2- content was determined according to liu et al.
 <cit> . leaf tissue was extracted in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm potassium phosphate buffer  and centrifuged at  <dig>  ×g for  <dig> min. the reaction mixture containing  <dig>  ml of  <dig> mm phosphate buffer ,  <dig>  ml of  <dig> mm hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and  <dig> ml of the extract was incubated at 25°c for  <dig> min. then  <dig> mm sulfanilamide and  <dig> mm α-naphthylamine were added, further incubated at 25°c for  <dig> min and the absorbance was read at  <dig> nm. a standard curve  was prepared with nano <dig>  to calculate the production rate of o2-.

the h2o <dig> content in leaf samples was measured as described by mukherjee and choudhuri
 <cit> . leaf tissue was extracted with cold acetone to determine the h2o <dig> levels.  <dig> ml of the extract was mixed with  <dig>  ml of  <dig> % titanium dioxide in 20%  h2so <dig> and the mixture was then centrifuged at  <dig>  xg for  <dig> min. the intensity of yellow colour of the supernatant was measured at  <dig> nm and the concentration of h2o <dig> was calculated against the standard curve.

measurement of proline, soluble sugar and amino acid content
free proline content in the leaves was determined using acid ninhydrin as previously described
 <cit>  with minor modifications. plant tissue  was homogenised in  <dig>  ml 3% aqueous sulphosalicylic acid and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. after centrifugation,  <dig> μl of supernatant was diluted to  <dig> ml with distilled water, reacted with  <dig> ml of 2% ninhydrin in acetone and incubated at 90°c for  <dig> h. the samples were cooled on ice and  <dig> ml of toluene was added and vortexed for  <dig> min. the upper phase was aliquoted to determine absorbance at  <dig> nm in a t80+ uv–vis spectrophotometer . proline content was calculated by comparing the value against a standard curve derived from known concentrations of l-proline  and expressed as μg/mg of fresh weight. total soluble sugars were analysed by treating  <dig>  ml of the alcoholic extract with  <dig> ml of freshly prepared anthrone reagent  h2so4). this mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for  <dig> min as described by irigoyen et al.
 <cit> . after the mixture was cooled, absorbance at  <dig> nm was measured with a t80+ uv–vis spectrophotometer. a calibration curve was constructed with glucose in the range 20– <dig> μg/ml . total amino acid content was determined as described by shukla et al.
 <cit> . specifically,  <dig> ml of plant extract was treated with  <dig> ml of  <dig>  m citrate buffer ,  <dig> ml of 80% ethanol and  <dig> ml ninhydrin , followed by incubation at 95°c for  <dig> min. the samples were cooled and the absorbance at  <dig> nm was measured
 <cit>  with a t80+ uv–vis spectrophotometer.

na+, k+ and ca2+ ion content analysis
ion content was determined via the method described by shukla et al.
 <cit> . plant tissue  was digested in  <dig> ml of a solution of perchloric and nitric acids . the solution was dried on a hot plate at 90°c and reconstituted to  <dig> ml with deionised water before filtration through a  <dig>  μm microfiber filter. xylem sap was collected according to the method described by olias et al.
 <cit> . the ion content of digested plant tissues  and xylem sap was measured with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer .

statistical analyses
each experiment was performed three times and data from  <dig> plants were recorded. one-way anova with replicates was performed in microsoft excel. c.d. values were calculated at p =  <dig>  to determine the significance of difference between the means of wt and transgenic plants of each treatment group. mean values that were significantly different within treatment from each other are indicated by different letters. the sd was calculated to show the variation in the replicates.

RESULTS
sbsos <dig> encodes a putative na+/h+ antiporter
the cdna fragment spanning the entire open reading frame of sbsos <dig> was cloned and sequenced . the sbsos <dig> cdna was  <dig>  bp long, contained a  <dig> bp 5′ utr, a  <dig>  bp open reading frame and a  <dig> bp 3′ utr region. the cdna encoded a polypeptide of  <dig>  amino acid residues  with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . hydrophobicity plot analysis predicted the presence of  <dig> strong transmembrane helices, beginning with the n-terminus outside and continuing till  <dig> residues . the remaining c-terminal amino acid residues included a hydrophilic region and were predicted to reside in the cytoplasm. the sbsos <dig> protein sequences were compared with the conserved domain in ncbi database and two conserved regions were identified: nhap, an na+/h+ antiporter spanning the transmembrane domain  and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain  that is located at the c-terminal tail . the psipred protein structure prediction server was used to predict the secondary structure, which included  <dig> coils,  <dig> alpha-helices and  <dig> beta-strands . amino acid alignments of the sbsos <dig> sequence revealed a high degree of similarity to suaeda japonica sjsos <dig> , chenopodium quinoa cqsos <dig> , mesembryanthemum crystallinum mcsos <dig> , populus euphratica pesos <dig> , solanum lycopersicum slsos <dig> , oryza sativa ossos <dig> , thellungiella halophila thsos <dig> , brassica napus bnsos <dig> , triticum aestivum tasos <dig>  and arabidopsis thaliana atsos <dig>  . phylogenetic relationships between these genes were examined by comparing the sbsos <dig> protein to  <dig> other species , which revealed that sbsos <dig> was in close proximity to other halophytes, suaeda japonica and chenopodium quinoa at  <dig> bootstrap values resolving mesembryanthemum crystallinum at another branch of  <dig> bootstrap values. similarly, other members of the cruciferae and poaceae families resolve their members in the same cluster, which is indicative of evolutionary conservation among the members of different families.

differential expression analysis of sbsos <dig> as a result of exposure to salt stress
to study the expression of sbsos <dig>  real-time pcr was performed with cdna from shoot and root tissues. constitutively expressed sbsos <dig> was  <dig>  times higher in root tissue than in shoot tissue . in root tissue, its expression was increased by 7-fold at  <dig> mm nacl, relative to  <dig> mm nacl; however, sbsos <dig> expression remained constant at concentrations above  <dig> mm that were as high as  <dig>  m . in shoot tissue, sbsos <dig> expression increased from  <dig> - to 4-fold in response to increasing nacl concentration .

overexpression of sbsos <dig> increases salinity tolerance
analysis of t <dig> transgenic lines
the pcambia2301-35s:sbsos <dig> construct  was introduced into tobacco plants for functional validation of sbsos <dig> gene. putative transgenic lines were selected on kanamycin-containing medium and were subsequently verified by gus analysis . seventy individual transgenic lines derived from independent transgenic events were analysed by the gus assay. gus-positive plants were subsequently transferred to plastic pots containing garden soil and again to earthen pots after  <dig> days of hardening.

the gus-positive transgenic lines were further verified by pcr with gene specific real-time pcr primers  and gus-specific primers  . leaf disc assays were performed to determine the salinity tolerance of t <dig> transgenic plants. leaf discs of uniform size from wt and transgenic plants  were incubated in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl. leaf discs from wt plants began to turn yellow after  <dig> days and completely bleached after  <dig> days; in contrast, leaf discs from l <dig> and l <dig> plants remained relatively green . to measure chlorophyll content in wt and transgenic plants, quantitative analyses were performed. the chlorophyll content in wt plants was significantly reduced as a function of increasing salt concentration. of the two transgenic lines, l <dig> contained a larger amount of chlorophyll in the nacl treatment and its chlorophyll content was not significantly affected in  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl relative to wt plants .

analysis of t <dig> transgenic lines
t <dig> seeds exhibited the expected 3: <dig> ratio of kanr/ kans during germination in kanamycin-containing medium. three independent t <dig> transgenic lines were selected on the basis of gus intensity and were further analysed for transgene expression via semi-quantitative rt-pcr . to study the effect of salt stress on germination, wt and t <dig> seeds  were germinated in ms medium supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl. upon exposure to higher salt stress, the transgenic seeds exhibited better germination efficiency than wt seeds . the efficiency of germination was reduced by increasing nacl concentration for both wt and transgenic seeds . in  <dig> mm nacl, neither of the transgenic lines, nor the wt seeds, germinated until  <dig> days of seed inoculation . in addition to seed germination assays, the growth of t <dig> transgenic seedlings exposed to salt stress conditions were also examined . t <dig> seeds of wt and transgenic tobacco were allowed to germinate in ms medium for  <dig> days. subsequently, t <dig> seedlings were transferred to medium containing  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl . the t <dig> transgenic lines exhibited significant enhancements in shoot and root length and leaf area relative to wt plants . the transgenic lines also exhibited significant increases in both fresh and dry weight relative to wt . the l <dig> transgenic line performed better in response to salt stress in terms leaf area, shoot and root length, relative water content and fresh and dry weight relative to both wt and other transgenic lines . the wt leaves exhibited dehydration in the presence of nacl, whereas the transgenic lines were better hydrated and possessed higher relative water content . transgenic lines also exhibited better growth than their wt counterparts when subjected to salt stress in hydroponic culture .

electrolyte leakage, membrane stability and mda content analysis
relative to wt plants, the transgenic lines exhibited significantly reduced electrolyte leakage during salt stress . msi analyses revealed that the cell membrane of lines l <dig> and l <dig> was more stable than wt plants . transgenic lines accumulated less mda than wt in response to salt stress, which was indicative of reduced oxidative damage in plants overexpressing sbsos <dig> .

proline, total soluble sugar and amino acid content analysis
proline, total soluble sugar and amino acid contents were measured in wt and transgenic plants to substantiate the function of the sbsos <dig> gene. at  <dig> mm nacl, proline content was nearly identical in wt and transgenic plants; however, in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl, the transgenic plants had higher proline content relative to wt . transgenic lines and wt both exhibited a gradual accumulation of total soluble sugar by increasing nacl concentration; however, transgenic lines exhibited accumulation in all treatments that was greater than that of wt . whereas the total amino acid content decreased significantly in response to increased nacl concentration for both wt and transgenic lines, the transgenic lines exhibited a more modest decrease in amino acid content relative to wt treated with  <dig> mm nacl .

in vivo localisation and quantification of o2− and h2o <dig> in t <dig> plant leaves
control, non-stressed leaves from wt and transgenic plants exhibited similar staining. in contrast, wt leaves exhibited more staining than transgenic lines in the presence of salt . this result demonstrates that wt leaves accumulated more o2− and h2o <dig> than transgenic lines, confirming that sbsos <dig> helps to minimise nacl-induced oxidative stress in situ. further these results were confirmed by quantification of o2− and h2o <dig> accumulation . both o2− and h2o <dig> contents were found higher in the wt plants compared to transgenic lines .

ion content analysis
na+ content
at  <dig> mm nacl  transgenic and wt plants exhibited approximately equal na+ content in root, stem and leaf tissues individually. however, in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl; root and leaf tissues exhibited significant reductions in na+ ion content in all three transgenic lines  relative to wt plants . however, the accumulation of na+ ions was found to be significantly higher in stem tissues in transgenic lines compared with wt. in general, stem tissues exhibited a 5-fold increase in na+ content compared with root and leaf tissues. all transgenic lines exhibited higher concentrations of na+ than wt in xylem sap under both normal and stress conditions .

k+ ion content
k+ content decreased as a function of increasing nacl concentration in all tissues in both transgenic and wt plants . however, transgenic lines contained higher k+ content than wt in root, stem and leaf tissues. the maximum accumulation observed in stem tissue was 6-fold greater than that in leaf and root tissues. transgenic lines and wt plants accumulated equivalent levels of k+ in xylem sap at  <dig> mm nacl . relative to wt, transgenic lines showed an increased k+/na+ ratio in root and leaf tissues at all nacl concentrations. in stem tissues, the transgenic lines and wt exhibited ratios that were nearly equal.

ca2+ ion content
the transgenic lines showed greater ca2+ content than wt in both root and stem tissues at both nacl concentrations . stem tissues exhibited a 2-fold increase in ca2+ relative to root and leaf tissues. however, transgenic lines showed a slightly reduced ca2+ content in leaf tissue relative to wt in stress conditions . transgenic lines possessed a higher ca2+ content in xylem sap compared with wt under stress conditions .

discussion
salinity impedes plant growth and survival. plants survive various stresses via mechanisms that operate on the cellular and molecular level. salt stress can potentially perturb ion equilibrium in the plant system, and antiporters play an important role in adjusting cation concentrations to maintain cellular homeostasis. to avoid the toxic effects of salt, na+ ions are compartmentalised into vacuoles, or extruded to the apoplast, and remain at low concentrations in the cytosol
 <cit> . in response to salt stress, plants maintain high concentrations of k+ and low concentrations of na+ in the cytosol by regulating the expression and activity of k+ and na+ transporters and h+ pumps
 <cit> . until now, few reports have described the in planta overexpression of the sos <dig> gene from arabidopsis <cit> ; thellungiella <cit>  and puccinellia tenuiflora <cit> . subsequently, a small number of reports have described the sos <dig> genes from different plant sources, which were characterised primarily in yeast systems
 <cit> . to elucidate its function in salt tolerance, we have cloned the sbsos <dig> gene from the halophyte salicornia brachiata. the sbsos <dig> protein is predicted to contain  <dig> strong transmembrane regions  at the amino-terminus, and a large cytoplasmic region at the carboxyl terminus . the n-terminal portion that forms the membrane pore exhibited the greatest sequence homology, whereas c-terminal domains were less similar . the tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> regions are highly conserved . amino acid alignment of sbsos <dig> revealed a high degree of similarity to suaeda japonica sjsos <dig>  chenopodium quinoa cqsos <dig>  mesembryanthemum crystallinum mcsos <dig>  populus euphratica pesos <dig>  solanum lycopersicum slsos <dig>  oryza sativa ossos <dig>  thellungiella halophila thsos <dig>  brassica napus bnsos <dig>  triticum aestivum tasos <dig> and arabidopsis thaliana atsos <dig> by 90%, 83%, 75%, 68%, 66%, 62%, 61%, 61%, 60% and 57%, respectively. a phylogenetic analysis revealed that sbsos <dig> is closely related to caryophyllales  .

real-time pcr revealed that the expression of sbsos <dig> remained higher in root tissues than in shoot tissues . similarly, kant et al.
 <cit>  observed a 7-fold increase in thsos <dig> transcript expression in roots relative to shoots. in shoot tissue, the expression was slightly increased in response to  <dig>  m nacl and increased significantly at higher concentrations. in contrast, even at  <dig> mm, expression increased by 7-fold in the root and remained constant thereafter . maughan et al.
 <cit>  also observed that sos <dig> expression was high at low salt concentration in the root tissue of c. quinoa, which indicates that the sos <dig> gene is hyper-inducible in the roots of halophytic plants at even low salt concentrations. similarly, the sos <dig> gene from other plants was expressed more highly in the root in response to salt stress
 <cit> . p. euphratica pesos <dig> mrna remained consistently high in shoot tissue when treated with  <dig> mm for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> h
 <cit> .

transgenic plants overexpressing sbsos <dig> exhibited increased salt tolerance and higher rates of seed germination. furthermore, in response to salt stress, transgenic plants exhibited increases in root length, shoot length, leaf area, fresh weight, dry weight, relative water content  and chlorophyll content relative to wt . nacl also causes the dehydration stress in plants because of the physiological drought stress. munns and tester
 <cit>  have mentioned that the salinity stress first causes the rapid osmotic stress followed by slow na+ stress. the rapid osmotic stress in plants consecutively follows rapid dehydration. oh et al.
 <cit>  studied that thellungiella thsos1-rnai lines were highly salt sensitive and faster na+ accumulating and showed severe water loss in shoots under salt stress and slower removal of na+ from the roots compared with the wt. in the present study, the water retention was found higher in transgenic lines, confirming that sbsos <dig> help in water retention during na+ stress to prevent from physiological desiccation. the chlorophyll content was found higher in arabidopsis transgenic plants than wt in the presence of salt stress. the increase in chlorophyll content indicates that sos <dig> transgenic plants have better light harvesting and photosynthetic capacities than wt during salt stress
 <cit> . the morphological features of the transgenic plants were similar to those of wt plants under normal growth conditions.

in the present study, transgenic plants experiencing salt stress exhibited low electrolyte leakage and greater cell membrane stability . this observation was corroborated by the reduction in mda. analysis of the in vivo localisation of ros via nbt and dab revealed that sbsos1-overexpressing lines maintained less ros in response to salt treatment, which indicates a reduced potential for oxidative damage resulting from salt stress. katiyar-agarwal et al.
 <cit>  has reported that sos <dig> interacts with rcd  <dig>  via its predicted cytoplasmic tail to regulate the expression of ros-scavenging genes. the relative abundance of proline, total soluble sugar and amino acids are important biochemical indicators of salinity in plants
 <cit> . proline protects the plants in response to salt stress by regulating the accumulation of usable nitrogen, which contributes to membrane stability and mitigates the disruptive effect of nacl. transgenic plants overexpressing sbsos <dig> accumulate higher proline than wt plants during salt stress . total soluble sugar and amino acids are known to accumulate in plants during salt stress. sbsos <dig> transgenic lines accumulated higher levels of total soluble sugar and amino acids relative to wt plants . soluble sugars help transgenic plants to survive salt stress by regulating osmoregulation and by acting as molecular chaperones that stabilise protein structure
 <cit> . similarly, the increased accumulation of amino acids suggests a higher rate of protein synthesis in plants experiencing salt stress.

studying ion partitioning in different plant tissues is important to fully understand the function of the transporter genes in that system. previously, shi et al.
 <cit>  observed that, at  <dig> mm nacl, sos <dig> mutant plants accumulated more na+ in the shoot and xylem sap than wt, which suggests that sos <dig> functions in retrieving na+ from the xylem stream in response to severe salt stress. additionally, they overexpressed atsos <dig> in arabidopsis, which led to a reduced accumulation of na+ in the shoot and xylem sap at  <dig> mm nacl
 <cit> . however, both of these studies were performed in arabidopsis plants. as described by olias et al.
 <cit> , arabidopsis plants limit the precise dissection of the relative content of na+ in stem vs. leaf; however, the ability to make this distinction is critical in assessing the role of sos <dig> in xylem loading/unloading, as well as na+ export in roots and retention in stems. therefore, the present study was performed to examine the ion partition in different plant organs by overexpressing the sbsos <dig> gene in tobacco, which has more convenient anatomy
 <cit> . transgenic tobacco plants accumulated lower na+ content in root and leaf at higher salt stress; in contrast, na+ content was higher in stem and xylem sap relative to wt, which suggests a role in na+ loading to xylem from root and leaf tissue. whereas, shi et al.
 <cit>  suggested that sos <dig> function in retrieving na+ from the xylem stream under severe salt stress, our study supports the hypothesis of olias et al.
 <cit> , which suggests that the sos <dig> functions in na+ loading to xylem from root and leaf tissues.

potassium is important to the plant system because it plays a role during plant growth and development. in response to nacl stress, the sbsos <dig> transgenic lines showed higher k+ content in root and leaf tissue compared to wt plants. transgenic lines showed higher ratios of k+/na+ relative to wt plants in root and leaf tissues at all nacl concentrations. even under normal conditions, the transgenic lines exhibited high k+/na+ ratios. however, in stem tissues, there was no significant difference between transgenic lines and wt plants . wu et al.
 <cit>  showed that sos <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to na+ stress and defective in high-affinity k+ uptake; furthermore, these two phenotypes always co-segregated. shi et al.
 <cit>  and quintero et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that a yeast strain  expressing atsos <dig> accumulated less na+ and exhibited improved k+ status compared with empty vector controls. it has also been reported that atsos <dig> does not suppress defects of the yeast k+ transport mutant  <cit>  and aids indirect uptake and transport of k+ ions. accordingly, sos <dig> mutant plants displaced defective k+ uptake at low external concentrations, and their transport capacity was not altered by overexpression of the sos <dig> protein at reduced k+ concentrations. however, cymodocea sos <dig> promoted uptake of k+ in bacteria
 <cit> . similarly, wu et al.
 <cit>  revealed that pesos1-expressing bacteria maintained lower na+ and higher k+ in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl relative to vector alone, which resulted in an increase in the k+/na+ ratio.

stress and other extracellular stimuli influence intracellular ca2+ concentration
 <cit> . ca2+-mediated signal transduction is considered one of the earliest events in salt signalling and plays an essential role in ion homeostasis that permits salt tolerance in plants
 <cit> . the sbsos <dig> transgenic lines showed higher ca2+ content than wt in root and stem tissues at both nacl concentrations . however, transgenic lines showed slightly lower ca2+ content in leaf tissues relative to wt plants exposed to salt stress . transgenic lines exhibited increases in ca2+ content relative to wt plants in xylem sap at stress conditions . similar to our studies, guo et al.
 <cit>  proposed a link between ca2+ transport and sos <dig> activity, and also demonstrated that the sos mutant alters the activity of ca2+ transport systems in both normal and nacl stress conditions. in wt plants, the ca2+ influx rate increased after a  <dig> min treatment with nacl, resulting in an increase in cytoplasmic ca2+. during the same time interval, ca2+ efflux was observed in sos <dig> mutants, which resulted in a decrease in cytoplasmic ca2+. the variability of ca2+ content in the sbsos <dig> transgenic lines, compared with wt, can be attributed to changes in ca2+ transporter activity. therefore, it is possible that sbsos <dig> affects the ca2+ transporter.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the sbsos <dig> gene from the extreme halophyte s. brachiata was cloned which showed expression during salt stress. sbsos <dig> expression was consistently higher in the root tissue than shoot tissue and was upregulated by salt stress. overexpression of sbsos <dig> in tobacco conferred a high degree of salt tolerance, enhanced plant growth and altered physiological and biochemical parameters in response to salt stress. furthermore, the transgenic lines exhibited lower levels of mda and ros accumulation as a result of reduced cytosolic na+ content and oxidative damage. transgenic tobacco plants accumulated reduced na+ content in root and leaf tissues, but higher na+ content in stem and xylem sap, relative to wt, which resulted from enhanced na+ loading in xylem from root and leaf tissues. this finding demonstrates that, in addition to the na+ efflux outside the plasma membrane, sbsos <dig> transporter also helps to maintain differing concentrations of na+ in various organs. these results support a broader role of sbsos <dig> in planta and suggest that this gene can be utilised to develop salt-tolerant transgenic crops in the future.
