BACKGROUND
cell cycle progression is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases  complexes. cdk <dig> in complex with e type cyclins regulates the transition through the restriction point in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and early events in s phase. a major function of cyclin a/cdk <dig> complexes is to promote dna replication and the progression though s phase  <cit> . consistent with these important functions are the involvement of cdk <dig> kinase complexes in diseases, including cancer  <cit> . different cyclins are overexpressed while the expression of cdk inhibitors is reduced in different tumor entities  <cit> . these findings suggest that cdks are promising targets for pharmaceutical interventions and cdk <dig> inhibitors are in clinical trials . moreover, wee <dig>  a tyrosine kinase repressor of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  is targeted by small molecules to prevent repression of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> in response to dna damage and thus enhance genetic instability and apoptosis  <cit> . thus the activation or repression of these cdks is potentially beneficial to cancer patients dependent on the nature of the tumor  <cit> . together, these findings suggest that the molecular understanding of the catalytic function of these kinases is both of fundamental and clinical relevance.

in general, cyclin/cdk <dig> complexes phosphorylate substrate proteins at s or t residues . early on it was recognized that these kinases prefer s/t sites that are followed by a proline   <cit> , an amino acid that is conserved across nearly all cyclin/cdk substrates. the use of oriented peptide libraries in kinase assays with cyclin a/cdk <dig> resulted in the description of hhasprk as an optimal substrate peptide  <cit> , with a basic residue frequently observed at the p +  <dig> site  <cit> . this was used to obtain structural information of the cyclin a/cdk <dig> complex bound to a substrate peptide  <cit> , supporting the conclusion that the amino acids at positions p +  <dig>  p +  <dig> and p +  <dig>  are recognized by the enzyme.

the above summarized findings relate to a rather small peptide. whether such a sequence is sufficient for mediating phosphorylation in cells is not known. frequently multiple lower affinity interactions contribute to functional specificity  <cit> . one such motif for at least some cyclin/cdk complexes is the rxl sequence on substrates. cyclin a can interact with this short sequence motif, which enhances specificity beyond the sequence recognized by the kinase domain, and was found to be important to mediate cdk <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . moreover, it is feasible that also the short sequence motif found to interact with the catalytic domain, which is characterized by a p at the p +  <dig> and a basic amino acid at the p +  <dig> site, is further expanded and thus might offer additional selectivity.

defining interaction domains of substrates, beyond their minimal peptide sequence, with their enzymes allows more detailed molecular analysis. of interest is to understand whether cdk <dig> recognizes its substrates by a common binding mode beyond the consensus sequence s/t-p-x-r/k/h described above. thus, do longer peptide chains, as present in real proteins, affect binding and phosphorylation? to know more about the interaction of cdk <dig> with a substrate is also indicated as cdk <dig> inhibitors are evaluated as therapeutic tools in clinical trials  <cit> . more detailed knowledge of enzyme-substrate interaction may allow defining more selective inhibitors beyond atp analogs. here we address this issue by using homology modeling, docking, and bioinformatics conservation analyses and biochemical methods. we focus on the tumor suppressor p27kip <dig>  whose cyclin e/cdk <dig> and cyclin a/cdk2-dependent phosphorylation results in subsequent degradation  <cit> . we observe that additional interactions of p27kip <dig> with cdk <dig> are relevant to enhance phosphorylation rates.

RESULTS
consensus sequences of cdk <dig> substrates
the majority of information on substrate sequences for cdk <dig> has been obtained from analyzing peptide and protein substrates using in vitro kinase assays. we wanted to define whether the cdk <dig> consensus substrate sequence extends beyond the s/t-p-x-r/k/h motif when sites that were confirmed in cells were used. we used phosphositeplus  <cit>  to define potential cdk <dig> substrates. we then screened the relevant publications i) for direct phosphorylation of the substrate by cyclin/cdk <dig> including mapping of the site phosphorylated in vitro, ii) for phosphorylation of this site in cells using mass spectrometry and/or phosphospecific antibodies, and iii) for altered phosphorylation of this site in response to modulating cdk <dig> activity by genetic means or for phosphorylation in a cell cycle-dependent manner that is consistent with cdk <dig> activity. thirty-five cdk <dig> sites of a total of  <dig> substrates fulfilled these criteria . sequence logo analysis of these cdk <dig> sites suggested that the s/t-p motif is invariable and that nearly 80% of the substrates possess a basic amino acid at p +  <dig> . thus, most substrates fulfill the requirements of the consensus sequence obtained by using peptide substrates. little preference for other amino acids at any other position was detected. this is consistent with the concept that additional determinants of various nature, including the rxl motif  <cit> , might contribute to the substrate specificity in cells  <cit> . moreover, additional amino acids in the sequence that is modified and that is recognized near the catalytic cleft may contribute to selectivity. together several different weak determinants may contribute to the overall affinity of an individual substrate and thus contribute to the efficiency of phosphorylation.table  <dig> information on human cdk <dig> substrates confirmed by in vivo experiments

structural model of a p27kip <dig> substrate peptide with cyclin a/cdk2
we have addressed the role of additional amino acids close to the consensus sequence for the tumor suppressor p27kip <dig>  one of the best-studied substrates of cdk <dig> complexes. p27kip <dig> functions as an inhibitor of cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> complexes and thus has the ability to interfere with cell cycle progression, for example in response to anti-proliferative signals  <cit> . p27kip <dig> is a naturally unfolded protein that is largely disordered in solution . thus, determining its conformation based on computational methods is currently very challenging. in complex with cyclin a/cdk <dig>  the n-terminal portion of p27kip <dig>  assumes a stable conformation. in the co-crystal of cyclin a/cdk2—p27kip <dig> two binding regions in the latter were identified  <cit> . amino acids 25– <dig> of p27kip <dig> interact with cyclin a, whereas amino acids 52– <dig> bind to cdk <dig>  this second interaction region includes the so-called  <dig> helix, which contains y <dig> . y <dig> is substrate of non-receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . y <dig> phosphorylation triggers a conformational transition and ejects the p27kip <dig>  <dig> helix from the cdk <dig> catalytic cleft  <cit> . this in turn allows the binding of the c-terminal part of p27kip <dig> and the subsequent phosphorylation of t <dig> by cdk <dig>  <cit> . this site is part of the cdk <dig> consensus sequence with t187pkk in p27kip <dig> fig.  <dig> schematic visualization of p27kip <dig> and structural model of the cyclin a/cdk2/p27kip <dig> peptide  complex. a schematic representation of the domain organization of p27kip <dig>  the n-terminal segment , the n-terminal kinase inhibitory domain , the c-terminal region , and the nuclear localization sequence  are indicated. the known phosphorylation sites observed in p27kip <dig> are also indicated  <cit> . the cyclin and cdk <dig> binding regions in kid are highlighted  <cit> . the available crystal structure data for p27kip <dig> are highlighted by black bars   <cit>  and 2ast   <cit> ). the c-terminal binding region , for which a structural model was constructed, is indicated by a dashed box. b the overall structure is shown in cartoon representation. cdk <dig>  cyclin a, and the peptide substrate  are colored in blue, orange, and green, respectively. the model contains atp. c close-up view of the binding interface between p27kip <dig> and cyclin a/cdk <dig>  hydrogen bonds are highlighted in black dashed lines. d sequence alignment showing the conservation of e <dig> in cdk <dig> compared with other cdks. the sequence alignment was obtained using the clustal omega webserver  <cit> . identical and structurally similar residues are indicated in red and green, respectively




no structural information is presently available for the c-terminal half of p27kip <dig> . there are two main strategies for structural predictions of protein complexes  <cit> . template-based docking is a high-throughput method, which performs fairly well when using with high- and medium-sequence or structural similarity  between template and target. this is not the case for cdk <dig> substrates as the peptide  in the only available crystal structure of a cyclin a/cdk2/substrate complex is not large enough to provide sufficient information of the protein-protein interface for template-based docking  <cit> . because of this, free docking is the method of choice with the interacting proteins using the available experimental constraints. as pointed out above, p27kip <dig> is disordered and no structural information is available, specifically of the c-terminal half of the protein that contains the cyclin a/cdk <dig> phosphorylation site. the occurrence of disordered regions for kinase substrates is common, because kinases normally phosphorylate sites in less ordered regions that are exposed on the surface of proteins . hence, we applied homology modeling, along with existing information of identical short amino acid sequences with known structures, to construct structural models of the interactor  <cit> . the docking was guided by two key observations. first, the phosphorylation site of the substrate forms an h-bond with atp  <cit> . second, the basic residue at the p +  <dig> site forms h-bonds to the phosphorylated t <dig>  of cdk <dig> and i <dig> of cyclin a  <cit> . phosphorylation of t <dig> in the activation loop is critical for catalytic activity of cdk <dig>  <cit> . consistent with a role of this kinase in late g <dig>  s and g <dig>  phosphorylation of t <dig> is high in these phases of the cell cycle  <cit> .

the p27kip <dig> peptide  adopted an extended conformation in the active site of cdk <dig> . the interactions that were noticed between cdk <dig> and the substrate in the crystalized cyclin a/cdk2/hhasprk structure  <cit>  and in the modeled cyclin a/cdk2/sirt <dig> complex  <cit>  are maintained. the positions of t <dig> and p <dig> are very similar in our model to those in the cyclin a/cdk2/hhasprk structure . the t <dig>  the p +  <dig> site amino acid, interacts with atp through an h-bond. more c-terminal the structures start to deviate clearly seen with k <dig>  which moves considerably due to the additional amino acids in the p27kip <dig> peptide  but still interacts with pt <dig> of cdk <dig> and i <dig> of cyclin a .fig.  <dig> superposition of the predicted model of cyclin a/cdk2/p27kip <dig> with cyclin a/cdk2/hhasprk x-ray structure . the cartoon representations of cdk <dig>  cyclin a, and the p27kip <dig> peptide  are colored in blue, orange, and green, respectively. the peptide substrate in the crystal structure is colored in cyan




lysine at the p +  <dig> site and turnover rate
in contrast to the crystal structure  <cit> , in which the arginine at the non-conserved p +  <dig> site does not have any contact with cyclin a/cdk <dig>  the lysine at the p +  <dig> site of p27kip <dig>  forms a salt bridge with atp and an h-bond with t <dig> of cdk <dig> . the first cyclin a/cdk <dig> structure solved contained one metal ion as part of the atp · mg2+ cofactor complex  <cit> , while many other kinases contain two. in a more recent study, a cyclin a/cdk <dig> transition state complex with adp, mgf3
– , and a short peptide was crystallized, which revealed a second mg2+ ion  <cit> . based on this structure, a mechanistic analysis suggested that cdk <dig> also uses  <dig> mg2+ ions  <cit> . the second mg2+ ion appears to associate reversibly with the active site. it is required just before the chemical step of the catalytic cycle and dissociates as soon as the reaction is complete. thus, it promotes efficient phosphoryl transfer. but this second mg2+ ion also increases, together with the other mg2+ ion, the affinity of adp and it therefore prevents efficient release. this would reduce the overall turnover rate of the enzymatic reaction  <cit> . keeping this in mind, we compared our model with the crystal structure of protein kinase a   <cit> . we observed that the location of the positively charged nitrogen atom of k <dig> of p27kip <dig> is similar to that of the second metal ion in pka . we speculate that k <dig> and its positive charge may affect the stability and/or the positioning of the second mg2+ ion and facilitate its release once the phosphoryl transfer is completed. in consequence this may result in an acceleration of the turnover rate. in support of this model, short cdk <dig> substrate peptides with k or r at the p +  <dig> position show the highest velocity of phosphoryl transfer, while acidic amino acids reduce velocity considerably  <cit> . together these findings indicate that the second mg2+ ion promotes catalysis and in combination with a basic residue at the p +  <dig> site of the substrates the price for a reduced turnover rate does not have to be paid  <cit> .fig.  <dig> superposition of cyclin a/cdk2/p27kip <dig> peptide  with the pka/atp/ <dig> mn2+ crystal structure . the second mn2+ in pka is indicated by cyan sphere. the cartoon representations of cdk <dig> and p27kip <dig> are colored in blue and green, respectively. pka is colored in cyan. pka residues are labeled with prime




specific contacts of the p +  <dig> arginine of the substrate peptide with cyclin a/cdk2
additional contacts were identified in our model of the trimeric cyclin a/cdk2/p27kip <dig> peptide  complex between the non-consensus part of p27kip <dig> and cyclin a/cdk <dig>  s <dig> and g <dig> of the p27kip <dig> peptide make h-bonds with the active site residues q <dig> and k <dig> of cdk <dig>  respectively . importantly, r <dig> of p27kip <dig> forms h-bonds with e <dig> of cdk <dig> and p <dig> of cyclin a, both of which are located at the binding interface between cdk <dig> and cyclin a. this glutamate is conserved across cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> and belongs to the extension loop of the pstaire helix of cdk <dig>  , which shows the most significant movement upon cyclin a binding  <cit> . thus, r <dig> may play a role in the phosphorylation of p27kip <dig> by cyclin a/cdk <dig> through interacting with and altering the position of the extended pstaire loop. this might stabilize the active cyclin a/cdk <dig> complex.

arginine at the p +  <dig> position enhances the enzymatic turnover rate
to validate our model, we performed in vitro kinase assays. a p27kip <dig> wild-type  peptide  and a peptide with an r194a substitution were synthesized and their capacity to be phosphorylated by cyclin a/cdk <dig> was evaluated. we determined the kinetic constants for these synthetic peptides. the km values of the two peptides were very similar with  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm for the wt and r194a, respectively . however, we observed a difference in the maximal relative rate of phosphoryl transfer between the two peptides, i.e.  <dig>  and  <dig>  pmol/min for the wt and the r194a peptide, respectively . thus the turnover rate of the wt peptide was twice as high as of the r194a mutant peptide. it is possible that the interaction of r <dig> with both cyclin a and cdk <dig> allows a faster correct orientation of the p +  <dig> site amino acid t <dig> in the catalytic cleft. this data suggests that beside the core consensus sequence defined by the hhasprk peptide additional residues can be involved in determining the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation.fig.  <dig> analysis of cyclin a/cdk <dig> kinase activity on p27kip <dig> substrate peptides. cyclin a/cdk <dig> kinase purified from sf <dig> cells was incubated with increasing concentrations of p27kip <dig> wild type and the r194a mutant peptide as indicated. phosphorylation of the peptides was monitored after immobilisation on sam <dig> membrane by scintillation counting and analysis by graphpad prism software. shown are mean values ± sd of  <dig> experiments performed in duplicates





CONCLUSIONS
the minimal consensus sequence for cdk <dig> and several other cdks matches the sequence s/t-p-r/k/h. this information is mainly drawn from work with short model peptides as substrates . to increase specificity of an enzyme-substrate interaction, additional determinants are required, which may be distinct between substrates. in more general terms it has been argued that during evolution multiple lower affinity interactions have been selected to contribute to functional specificity  <cit> . intuitively, one might expect that systems develop towards high affinity interactions. however, this seems not to be the case. in fact, signaling, and thus the flow of information, often involves non-structured parts of proteins and low affinity interaction. nevertheless, these processes are remarkably specific and functional. moreover, proximity is another important aspect to create specificity  <cit> . this may include the use of scaffold proteins, targeting subunits or specific microenvironments that allow the co-localization of proteins. all these aspects contribute to the substrate specificity of enzymatic reactions. for example the use of scaffold proteins has been well documented for the activation of map kinases in different signaling pathways  <cit> . in some respect cyclins also have scaffolding function, in addition to activating the cdk. for some cyclin/cdk complex substrates an rxl motif, which is recognized by the cyclin, is important for efficient phosphorylation  <cit> . here we identified amino acid p +  <dig> of the cdk <dig> phosphorylation site at t <dig> in p27kip <dig> as important for the phosphoryl transfer rate. r <dig> enhances the turnover rate of a peptide substrate compared to a mutant peptide with r194a. the p +  <dig> site is not conserved in cellular cdk <dig> substrates, suggesting that it has a unique effect on p27kip <dig> as a key substrate in the control of cell cycle progression. in other substrates, other changes may affect the enzymatic properties and thus, depending on the specific needs, different alterations in substrates may contribute to the efficiency of phosphorylation by cdk <dig>  moreover, the identification of the amino acid p +  <dig> of the substrate as relevant for catalysis suggests that determinants relatively far from the site of modification could be relevant for interfering with cdk <dig> activity. such determinants could contribute to developing more selective inhibitors, which might be relevant in light of the interest in developing selective cdk inhibitors for therapeutic purposes  <cit> .
