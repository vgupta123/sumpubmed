BACKGROUND
calcium  is a major component of the skeleton in vertebrates and the exoskeleton of some invertebrates  and plays key roles in a wide range of physiological processes, such as muscular contraction, modulation of permeability and excitability of plasma membranes, nerve signal transduction or intracellular signaling  <cit> .

terrestrial vertebrates obtain calcium mainly through their diet and whole-body calcium homeostasis is mainly achieved by intestinal absorption and kidney reabsorption  <cit> . the range of calcium in water can range from trace levels in soft fresh water to  <dig> mm in seawater and fish that live in those waters are able to retrieve most or all the calcium they need from the surrounding water. furthermore, many species  have the capacity to rapidly adjust to a wide range of environmental calcium concentrations  <cit> . the ability of teleost fishes to maintain circulating calcium  within narrow limits is well documented  <cit>  and is mediated by rapid rate changes of water and calcium exchange in gill, intestine, kidney and skin epithelia .

the gill epithelium is the main site of active ca2+ uptake from the water at low , while at higher , such as in seawater , the intestine acquires also an important role  <cit> . the gill, together with the kidney, also appears to play a role in ca2+ excretion but little is known about this process  <cit> . branchial ca2+ uptake appears to occur mainly through specialized mitochondrion-rich cells  or "chloride cells" following a 3-step process similar to that proposed for ca2+ reabsorption in the mammalian kidney: passive entry of ca2+ through apical epithelial ca2+ channels ; transcellular transport in the cytoplasm or sequestration in organelles through binding to ca2+-binding proteins ; and active basolateral extrusion to the blood via a plasma membrane ca2+-atpase  or a na+/ca2+-exchanger   <cit> . when fish are exposed to low or high calcium environments, they respond by modifying gill ca2+ uptake; altering the number, area and morphology of mr cells, gene expression of epithelial calcium channel  and other osmoregulatory mediators  <cit> . however, there is still relatively little knowledge of the gill molecular machinery involved in the adjustments to changes in , in particular the early events.

finally, the internal and external ca2+ sensing mechanisms , intracellular signaling and the endocrine control of ca2+ balance in fish, which differs from that of terrestrial animals, have been the subject of several physiological studies and recent reviews  <cit> , but much remains to be discovered about their mechanisms of action and target genes in ca2+-transporting epithelia.

this study sought to detail the cellular mechanisms and determine the genes involved in the rapid perception, signal transduction and effector responses of teleost fish gills to changes in environmental ca2+. to this end, we analyzed the gill transcriptome of the green spotted puffer fish  soon after transfer from brackish water  to brackish water containing  <dig>  and  <dig> mm ca2+. the  tested cover the range teleost fish are generally exposed to in nature: from  <dig>  mm in ion-poor fresh water to  <dig> mm in sea water  <cit> . the choice of time points analyzed after transfer  sought to capture the early transcriptomic responses of the acclimation process. t. nigroviridis was chosen as the experimental model because of two main reasons: 1) it is euryhaline and able to tolerate wide variations in water   streams and rivers, estuaries and coastal waters  <cit>  and in experimental conditions tolerate direct transfers from fw to sw and vice-versa  <cit> ), and 2) its genome and many cdnas have been sequenced  <cit> , facilitating gene identification from sequenced data. the gill transcriptomic responses were obtained using a variation of serial analysis of gene expression   <cit>  designated supersage, a global and quantitative transcriptomic technique based on high throughput sequencing and counting of small transcript-identifier tags, 26-bp instead of 14-bp in sage. the larger supersage tags results in improvements in tag-to-gene annotation  and characterization of identified tags  <cit> , and has been adapted to massively parallel pyrosequencing using a bar-code system which simplifies the procedure and permits higher throughput  <cit> .

as a result of transfer of t. nigroviridis from water containing  <dig>  mm ca2+ to water containing  <dig>  and  <dig> mm ca2+  <dig>  differentially expressed gill transcripts were identified and clustered into sub-groups of genes with distinct patterns of expression. gene ontology  enrichment analysis of the annotated tags allowed the identification of biological processes, functions and cell compartments that were most affected. relative expression changes in  <dig> genes were also compared by quantitative pcr . the data obtained in this study provide the first comprehensive catalogue of genes implicated in the rapid acclimation responses of fish gill cells to changes in water ca2+ availability.

RESULTS
total plasma calcium and ca2+ channel gene expression
transfer of t. nigroviridis from water containing  <dig>  mm ca2+ to water containing  <dig>   and  <dig> mm ca2+  resulted, respectively, in a small decrease and increase in blood plasma total , both at  <dig> and  <dig> h, which was significantly different between the two experimental groups . at the same time the expression level of gill epithelial calcium channel mrna  changed in the opposite direction, i.e., up-regulation in lowca and down-regulation in highca which were statistically significant  between these experimental groups  <dig> h after transfer. the expression of casr transcripts was also detected at very low levels in the gills of all experimental groups by quantitative real-time  pcr , but no changes in gene expression in response to water  were detected . these results are in agreement with previous studies  <cit>  and confirmed that the experimental approach induced a challenge to calcium balance mechanisms in t. nigroviridis gills.

effects on global gene expression
five gill supersage libraries from control fish at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h , from lowca at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  and from highca at  <dig> h only  were sequenced in a single half run of  <dig> pyrosequencing and yielded  <dig>  reads . stringent quality control of ditag sequences yielded  <dig>   <dig> bp-supersage mono-tags which were retained for further analysis . each library contained on average of ~ <dig>  tags of which ~ <dig>  were unique .

1total number of tags extracted from each library after quality selection.  <dig> unique tags  obtained for each library.  <dig> number of unitags in each abundance class, based on their tag count in each library;  <dig> percentage of unitags in each abundance category relative to the total number of unitags per library .

supersage libraries prepared from gills in control water for  <dig> or  <dig> h ; low calcium water for  <dig> or  <dig> h  or high calcium water for  <dig> h .

approximately 70% of the unitags were singletons , while the number of unique transcripts decreased for classes with higher abundance . singleton tags were included in the statistical analysis  <cit>  to avoid losing information from low abundance transcripts, but those appearing only in one library  failed the stringent multiple tests to assess differential expression.

in order to eliminate genes potentially responding to handling stress , the gill expression profiles of ca2+ challenged libraries were always compared to the gill profile of fish transferred to control water at the corresponding time-point , while two types of statistical tests and multiple library comparisons  were also carried out to increase stringency and to account for time-effects. a total of  <dig>  unique tags  showing differential expression between control and  treatments were identified of which  <dig>  were up- or down-regulated at least 2-fold and selected for further analyses.

tag annotation
the annotation of the differentially expressed tags was carried out by blastn mapping to available dna sequences for this species, followed by blastx assignment of these longer  cdnas or 1000-bp dna fragments  to the highly curated non-redundant swiss-prot protein database.

in the blastn step, carried out under high stringency ,  <dig> tags  matched to one or more cdnas available in genbank ,  <dig> tags  matched cdnas predicted from the t.nigroviridis genome  and  <dig> tags  matched the genome , making a total of  <dig> tags with a dna match to available t.nigroviridis dna datasets . three hundred and fifty three tags  mapped only to the genome or ensembl genome predicted cdnas  and may represent novel transcripts. it was not possible to calculate the rate of unambiguous tag mapping to unique transcripts, since the available cdna dataset contained multiple redundant expressed sequence tags  and no unigene  <cit>  dataset is available for t.nigroviridis. however, only a reduced number of tags matched more than one location in the genome , suggesting unambiguous annotation for most 26-bp tags.

1total number  and percentage  of differentially expressed unique tags  with a significant  or non significant blastn match to nucleotide sequences of t.nigroviridis available in databases.  <dig> number and percentage of tag-matching t.nigroviridis cdnas or genome fragments showing significant  or non-significant matches with the swiss-prot database.  <dig> summary of the 2-step tag annotation results .

four hundred and seventy differentially expressed tags  could not be mapped to any available dna sequence and may represent genes or splice variant transcripts not previously covered by the sequencing of genomic and expressed sequence tag  data. depending on the dna dataset, lowering stringency to 24/ <dig> nucleotide matches improved annotation up to 19% , suggesting that some tags contain nucleotide mismatches to available dnas, potentially derived from sequencing errors or single-nucleotide polymorphisms  in transcript sequences. however, even in these circumstances 60%  of the non-annotated tags could not be assigned, supporting the notion that they are not represented in available sequence databases. therefore the 26/ <dig>  stringency rule was maintained in this analysis to ensure a less ambiguous annotation of differentially expressed tags.

in the second step of annotation , the following preference order was used when assigning a protein id for the tags matching different dna datasets: the ncbi cdna blastx hit was used preferably compared to ensembl cdna hits , and only when no tag-matching cdnas were available or no significant blastx hit occurred  was genomic match used. this choice was supported by the lower blastx annotation rate for genomic 1000-bp fragments  compared to ncbi and ensembl cdnas , perhaps as a result of introns, regions with low sequencing quality or errors in assembly in genomic sequences. nevertheless, significant blastx hits for tags matching more than one dna dataset  were found to have the same annotation in  <dig> cases , to belong to the same protein family in  <dig> cases  and to differ only in  <dig> cases . these tags and those for genes selected for qpcr were subjected to careful manual annotation. detailed annotation results can be found in additional file  <dig>  which summarizes all data concerning the  <dig> differentially expressed tags.

in summary, we could map with high stringency  <dig> tags ,  <dig> to anonymous dnas and  <dig> to curated swiss-prot protein entries . the number of different genes identified  was lower than the number of tags annotated to protein, as  <dig> genes  had multiple tags assigned to the same gene , suggesting they were products of sequence polymorphisms and/or alternative mrna processing . in addition,  <dig>  of the annotated differentially expressed tags and  <dig> of the genes  were identified as putatively derived from natural antisense rna transcripts, as they had an inverted match to a sense cdna or a direct match to an antisense cdna.

most up- or down-regulated tags
we first looked at the  <dig> transcripts that underwent the largest up- or down-regulatory change for each challenge that could be annotated to well characterized genes . these included transcripts for a range of calcium-binding proteins or participants in cabp protein complexes involved in muscle contraction or cytoskeleton organization, such as actn <dig>  mle <dig>  mlrs, tnni <dig>  tpm <dig>  prvb and telt, which were rapidly and strongly up-regulated in gills of fish exposed to water with low . two genes, entk  and rl <dig> , were among the top  <dig> up-regulated transcripts at  <dig> h for both lowca and highca, while co8a <dig>  and frim  were among the most down-regulated for both lowca and highca, suggesting that some common mechanisms were activated.

clustering of expression patterns and enriched gene ontology
k-means clustering was used to group transcripts according to their patterns of expression between control and low ca2+ water over time  and across the three ca2+ availability conditions at  <dig> h .

for each analysis, six clusters  were obtained , containing  <dig> ±  <dig>  tags each, which showed clear distinguishable patterns between them. since most transcripts were common to both analyses, the number of tags common between clusters of the two analyses is also represented in figure 2c. to understand the biological significance of the identified differentially expressed transcripts, the gene ontology  <cit>  terms  significantly enriched in the whole lists of differential expressed tags or in each of the clusters compared to the normal gill transcriptome  were identified and are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

the biological process categories most significantly over-represented in the global lists of differentially expressed tags were mainly related to muscle contraction and cytoskeleton: categories "regulation of muscle contraction", "muscle contraction" and "cytokinesis" for both lowca and  <dig> h analysis; the "positive/negative regulation of atpase activity" and "response to calcium ion" in the lowca list and the "actin filament-based movement" in the  <dig> h list. the "phosphocreatine biosynthetic process", involved in cellular energy homeostasis, was enriched in lowca at  <dig> but not in the global  <dig> h list. among the enriched molecular functions in both analyses were the "structural constituent of muscle" and "motor activity categories", while the "calcium channel regulator activity" was enriched in the lowca list; finally, enriched cellular components included "sarcomer", "myofibril" and the troponin/myosin complexes.

enriched categories in the "lowca analysis"
when detailing the expression patterns of transcript tags whose expression was altered by water with low , cluster  <dig>  grouping  <dig> tags with a strong up-regulation at  <dig> h but not at  <dig> h , had the highest number of enriched categories  with the highest significance probabilities  and was the main contributor to enrichment in the global list of differentially expressed transcripts . this suggests a strong coordinated response of functionally related genes in response to the lowca stimulus at  <dig> h. enriched biological processes were mainly related to ca2+ signaling or homeostasis, muscle contraction and cytoskeleton, including all the categories indicated above plus specific categories such as "calcium-mediated signaling", "calcium ion homeostasis" and "actin cytoskeleton reorganization". transcripts grouped in this cluster and responsible for the enrichment in these categories include actin α skeletal muscle , several myosin  and troponin forms , α-tropomyosin , the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum  calcium atpase  <dig> , the sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase  and creatine kinase muscle type  <dig> . glucose metabolism also appears to have been affected in lowca, with "gluconeogenesis" enriched in this cluster , as well as up-regulation of genes involved in glycolysis, such as aldoa, enob and g3p. this suggests an increase in the conversion of non-carbohydrate substrates  into glucose and glucose oxidation, probably to meet the energetic needs of the acclimation response.

in addition to several molecular functions related to muscle contraction/cytoskeleton , the "calcium ion binding" category was enriched, with half of the cabps identified grouping in this cluster. the "creatine kinase activity"  was also enriched with several creatine kinase genes grouping in the cluster , and enriched cellular components included sarcomer, troponin and myosin complexes, myofibril and cytoskeleton.

changes in expression of 30% of the differentially expressed transcript tags in cluster  <dig> appear to be specific to the early-response to lowca, as they did not meet the criteria for the  <dig> h differential expression among water types .

cluster lowca- <dig> contains  <dig> transcript tags also up-regulated by lowca but only after  <dig> h . cytoskeleton remodeling appears to be induced also at  <dig> h, with enrichment in "intermediate filament-based process" and up-regulation of keratin  <dig>  and the intermediate filament protein on <dig> , while "glutathione transferase activity" was also enriched , suggesting an increase in detoxification activity. most transcripts in this cluster  fall into cluster  <dig> of the  <dig> h analysis , indicating they were regulated by lowca but not highca at the  <dig> h exposure, while 29%  were also regulated by highca .

cluster lowca- <dig> includes transcripts up-regulated by lowca at both  <dig> and  <dig> h , mainly enriched in categories related to energy generation such as "mitochondrial electron transport, nadh to ubiquinone", "atp synthesis coupled electron transport", "nadh dehydrogenase  activity", "mitochondrion", and contains transcripts for several nadh dehydrogenases and nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductases. thirty eight percent of the cluster transcripts  showed a general up-regulation by both low and high calcium challenges .

interestingly, clusters lowca- <dig> and - <dig> grouped tags with changing expression levels in the control water over time , but down-regulated by lowca at  <dig> or  <dig> h, respectively. whether or not these patterns of temporal variation in expression in control water reflect a response to stress, a natural control by circadian rhythms  or other type of control remains to be determined. cluster  <dig> was enriched in the biological processes "mitotic g <dig> checkpoint" and included genes related to cell division such as ccnd <dig>  and "defense response" , while cluster  <dig> was enriched in the processes "response to unfolded protein", "sleep", "response to uv" and "positive regulation of wnt receptor signaling pathway" . ninety percent of the transcripts in cluster lowca- <dig> were down-regulated by both low and highca water at  <dig> h and fell into clusters  <dig> or  <dig> from the  <dig> h analysis . finally, cluster lowca- <dig> contained transcripts down-regulated by lowca at  <dig> h and up-regulated at  <dig> h and was mainly enriched in "proteolysis"  and "tissue regeneration" , probably representing genes involved in tissue/cell remodeling during the responses towards acclimation to external ca2+ changes.

enriched categories in the " <dig> h analysis"
the most interesting clusters for the comparison between the effects of low and high water  exposure at  <dig> h  are clusters  <dig>  and  <dig> , and clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  . cluster  <dig> is enriched in "regulation of striated muscle contraction"  while cluster  <dig> is enriched in "collagen catabolic process", containing genes for proteases such as pepd but also one collagen form, co8a <dig>  cluster  <dig> includes transcripts only up-regulated by highca at  <dig> h but not by lowca, 43% of which are also not regulated by lowca in the  <dig> h exposure time . however, no go category was significantly enriched in this cluster, indicating that it contains a heterogeneous group of non-functionally related genes. examples of genes only up-regulated by highca include ubiquitin , the gtp-binding nuclear protein ran  and serine/threonine-protein kinase sgk <dig> .

cluster  <dig>  containing genes down-regulated by highca at  <dig> h but not  by lowca is significantly enriched in  <dig> categories , 66% of which were also enriched in cluster lowca- <dig>  such as "muscle contraction", "cytokinesis", "positive regulation of atpase activity", "actin filament-based movement" and "phosphocreatine biosynthetic process"/"creatine kinase activity". this result indicates a difference in the responses to low or high ca2+, with the same processes that were up-regulated in lowca at  <dig> h being down-regulated in highca at  <dig> h . specific categories enriched in this cluster compared to clusters of the lowca analysis include "protein secretion", "cell motility" or "ephrin receptor signaling pathway" .

differential transcript expression of proteins from selected functional groups
to focus on the effects of water ca2+ availability on the gill intracellular signaling machinery and on the gill effector mechanisms, we highlight in table  <dig> five selected functional categories and related genes that were identified as differentially expressed through transcript tag annotation. thirty genes  encoded different cabps and mainly grouped to clusters lowca- <dig>  and - <dig> , indicating that the expression of most identified cabps was rapidly up-regulated in response to lowca water , while 19% was down-regulated by highca at  <dig> h . one tag mapping to the important intracellular ca2+-sensing and signal transduction protein calmodulin  was slightly  but significantly  down-regulated by lowca at both  <dig> and  <dig> h, but is not included in our dataset of differentially expressed transcripts as its expression ratios are below our cut-off value of 2-fold.

protein symbol and description of swiss-prot protein entries to which differentially expressed tags were annotated are shown. criteria for inclusion each category were based on gene ontology annotation of swiss-prot entries: category "calcium-binding proteins"- genes annotated with molecular function "calcium ion binding", go:0005509; "transcription factors"- molecular function "transcription factor activity", go:0003700; "other regulators of transcription"- biological process "regulation of transcription", go:0045449; "components of signal transduction pathways/intracellular signaling"- genes annotated to biological process go categories containing the words "signaling" or "signal transduction", and "ion transporters/related to ion homeostasis or osmoregulation"- genes annotated to biological processes "ion transport", go: <dig> or "ion homeostasis", go: <dig>  in the calcium binding protein  category, * indicates proteins found in the cabp database http://structbio.vanderbilt.edu/cabp_database/; in the category components of signal transduction pathways, tf indicates transcription factors. for detailed information about tag sequences, counts, ratios of expression or clustering for each of these highlighted genes see additional file  <dig> 

fourteen genes for transcription factors were regulated by ca2+ with a variety of induction profiles , while  <dig> additional regulators of transcription were identified, most of which with a rapid response to lowca . a large number of transcripts for components of intracellular signaling pathways were also identified  with varying expression patterns .

eighteen genes  coding for ion transporters/ion homeostasis regulators and other proteins described to influence ionic changes in gills were identified among the differentially expressed transcripts , including five tags matching members from the claudin  superfamily of transmembrane tight junction proteins. annotation of these and  <dig> additional  cldn transcript tags via swiss-prot blastx mainly matched mammalian claudins  <dig> and  <dig>  but it was not possible to distinguish between fish claudin paralogues, as this gene family has been largely expanded in teleost fishes  <cit> . cldn tags were thus annotated by comparison with f. rubripes proteins, allowing the assignment of differential expression to fish cldn3a, cldn28a, cldn32a and cldn8d genes . similarly, a transcript for an aquaporin form has been annotated to fish aqp <dig>  using blastx against fish proteins only.

quantitative pcr of differentially expressed genes
the same mrnas used for supersage were individually analyzed by qpcr for eight genes detected to be differentially expressed by supersage. gene selection took into consideration the coverage of a wide range of transcript  abundance and patterns of differential expression . it also included genes containing a variable number of alternative tags although qpcr primers were not designed to distinguish alternative transcripts. a statistically significant positive correlation was obtained between the supersage expression  and qpcr expression levels  for  <dig> of the genes tested . furthermore, there was a highly significant positive correlation  for the relative expression of the  <dig> genes relative to control  between qpcr and supersage, indicating an overall concordance between the two techniques in detecting differential expression.

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide transcriptome profile of gill tissue to water ca2+ availability, and the deepest gill transcriptome study to date, identifying differential expression in  <dig>  out of  <dig>  different transcripts analyzed. other studies have analyzed gill transcriptomic changes in response to different challenges such as osmotic stress, heat stress, hypoxia or infection by parasites  <cit> , but the depth of analysis was much lower  and none was concerned with responses to calcium per se.

three notes of caution should be considered in the interpretation of these results. first, the gill is a heterogeneous, multifunctional organ composed by several types of cells and tissues   <cit>  and the expression profiles produced can result from any calcium responsive cell type. confirmation of the hypotheses generated by these data as being specific genes to ca2+ uptake/homeostasis requires confirmation by specific experiments, with focus on the gill epithelial mr cells, considered the primary site of active ca2+ uptake in this tissue and where most significant changes are expected to occur  <cit> . second, gene ontology enrichment analysis is mainly based on the annotation and comparison of lists of differentially expressed genes with data that is biased towards a few  model organisms and the involvement of a particular protein in biological processes in fish may differ from that in those species  <cit> . third, in common with other transcriptomic studies the produced gene sets are based on altered levels of mrna and assume parallel, but not confirmed, changes in protein abundance  <cit> .

because t. nigroviridis does not normally live in waters containing  <dig>  mm ca2+, it could be questioned whether some of the transcriptomic changes reflect acute stress induced by the low  itself. this is unlikely since the "response to stress" biological function category was not enriched among the differentially expressed genes. furthermore, of  <dig> proteins included in "response to stress" in the global data set only five .

plasma total calcium and gill expression of ecac
t. nigroviridis exposed to lower  had lower total calcium plasma levels than those exposed to high  at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h post-transfer , indicating a short-term dependence of total circulating levels on external , as observed in other fish species  <cit> . these changes are likely the result of the coordinated action of the gill, intestine and kidney, with decreased gill calcium uptake in lowca water. this is supported by the up-regulation of the  epithelial ca2+ channel  mrna detected by qpcr at  <dig> h  which suggests that this compensatory effector mechanism was activated in order to increase transepithelial ca2+ transport and restore ca2+ homeostasis. the counteracting mechanism was also observed in highca water with ecac mrna expression down-regulated. the plasma calcium and ecac response to changing water calcium are similar to what has been previously described in other fish species  <cit>  and acted as a positive control in our experiment.

global analysis of sage data
with approximately  <dig>  transcripts analyzed per library and assuming around  <dig>  transcripts are expressed per cell  <cit> , our analysis provides ~1-fold coverage for transcripts expressed at > <dig>  copies per cell and thus the produced profiles are comprehensive of the gill transcriptome. the tag extraction yield was 57% and approximately 70% of the unitags were singletons. these statistics are in agreement with other reports using the same methodology  <cit> .

the rate of annotation was high with 65% of the  <dig>  differentially expressed supersage tags which could be annotated . the specificity of tag mapping  was also high and within the level expected for 26-bp tags  <cit> . the assignment of multiple tags to  <dig> % of the genes annotated highlights the capacity of sage to detect and discriminate a diversity of mrna transcripts  <cit> . however, for  <dig> tags , some of which among the top  <dig> most-differentially expressed tags for each challenge, no dna or protein could be assigned. these results also reflect the capacity of sage to identify novel transcripts with potential relevance to the physiological process in study, given the magnitude of their differential expression. these can be isolated and identified  and will be an objective for future studies.

finally, there was general concordance between supersage and qpcr in detecting differential expression of genes within a wide range of abundance levels, patterns of differential expression and variable number of alternative tags , as found in other sage studies using similar analysis  <cit> . the lack of correlation for a minority of genes tested by qpcr may have been caused by their low expression levels and presence of multiple tags in all of them, a fact that has also been previously reported in other studies .

muscle contraction, cytoskeleton organization and cytokinesis
the main biological processes affected by short-term changes of water  were those related to muscle contraction, cytoskeleton organization and cytokinesis, with a rapid up-regulation of several actin, myosin and troponin forms, α-tropomyosin and α-actinin <dig>  among others,  <dig> h after exposure to low . some of the same genes were down-regulated  <dig> h after exposure to high .

the concerted altered expression of those genes suggests that cytoskeletal modulation and/or cell proliferation are part of the process of acclimation of t. nigroviridis gills to changed . furthermore, it is possible that mr cells are key elements of these changes, since several studies have shown modifications to the mr machinery in the gill and skin epithelia in several fish species in response to manipulations of environmental   <cit> . an important role for cytoskeletal actin in the mr cell short-term response to salinity change was previously suggested  <cit> , since disruption of actin polymerization was able to block the rapid apical crypt closing in response to hypotonic shock, while a thick annular actin ring was detected at the opening of these crypts in mr cells and was suggested to control its opening/closure  <cit> . although other explanations cannot be excluded, this could indicate that the transcriptomic changes we observed may be, at least to some extent, part of a common response to situations challenging ion homeostasis  in which cell number, area and morphology of gill epithelial cells  are modified with consequent modulation of ion fluxes . while most studies dealt with long-term acclimation periods of days or weeks, there are also reports showing mr morphological/proliferative modifications shortly after the challenge . additionally, other components of the cytoskeleton were also regulated by low or high ca2+ levels, including proteins forming the intermediate filaments  and the microtubule component β5-tubulin, consistent with a proposed role for the mr cell microtubule network in ca2+ uptake in tilapia larvae  <cit> . thus, the role of the cytoskeleton and the underlying processes during the early cellular adjustments of mr cells to ion  and osmotic regulation should be further investigated.

transcriptional changes of the actin cytoskeleton components could be also linked to changes in the structure and organization of the gills. muscle cells are present in the gill vasculature and in adductor/abductor muscles that control the angle between gill filaments  <cit>  and up-regulation of cytoskeletal actin, troponin and myosin complexes, and myofibril in low calcium may reflect the key role of ca2+ in muscle contraction. indeed, the concomitant up-regulation of cytoplasmatic cabp pvb, creatine kinase, ca2+ pump at2a <dig> and the enzyme ckm <dig>  all described to play a role in muscle relaxation  <cit> , suggest a coordinated action in muscle function and/or cytoskeleton reorganization in gill tissue.

calcium ion homeostasis
one of the most enriched go categories induced by low water ca2+ availability was, as expected, calcium-ion homeostasis. a rapid up-regulation after  <dig> h exposure to lowca water was detected for at2a <dig> , the ca2+ pump responsible for re-sequestration of ca2+ into the sr/er that, together with sr/er ca2+-release channels and cytoplasmatic/er luminal cabps, allow the tight regulation of cytosolic  in numerous cell types  <cit> . in addition, several genes for ca2+-buffering cabps were also up-regulated by lowca water after  <dig> h , including the er lumen cabps calsequestrin- <dig> and sarcalumenin, or the cytosolic cabps parvalbumin β and ictacalcin  <cit> , revealing for the first time a tight and rapid up-regulation of several elements of the ca2+ homeostasis control machinery at the transcriptional level in fish gills. whether the detected changes in expression are a general cellular response of fish gill to low calcium and/or are more specifically related to the ca2+ uptake pathway to maintain body calcium balance remains to be determined. however, the current accepted model for transepithelial ca2+ uptake across fish gill mr cells includes a transcellular transport step of ca2+ bound to cabps, such as ca2+-calmodulin, parvalbumin and ictacalcin, through the cytoplasm or its sequestration into organelles   <cit> . the up-regulation after  <dig> h exposure to lowca water of a number of cabps previously identified as ca2+-buffers supports their possible role in ca2+ uptake across fish gills, a hypothesis that may be validated by confirming these transcriptional changes specifically in the gill mr epithelial cells responsible for ca2+ uptake.

ca2+ sensing and signal transduction
very low and unchanging gene expression levels of calcium sensing receptor , the membrane receptor which senses extracellular calcium levels, were detected by qpcr and supersage . casr has been previously localized to the mr cells in fish gill epithelia and shown to activate phospholipase c and mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling in response to external  changes  <cit> . our results are consistent with reports in which the mrna and protein expression of casr were unaffected by calcium constraint  or by salinity changes  <cit> .

supersage detected the differential expression of a large number of cabps , including four proteins from the s- <dig> family , 75% of which were up-regulated after  <dig> h exposure to low water , while cam was down-regulated at both  <dig> and  <dig> h. the immediate early gene response  response of these cabp genes support the notion that they may be part of an intracellular ca2+ sensor network  <cit>  in fish gills involved in the initial perception of ca2+ availability and in the consequent activation of signaling pathways and target proteins.

ion and water homeostasis
only a small number of ion channel and transporter genes were found  and no differential expression of transporters such as pmca or ncx was detected. this is in agreement with the theory that ecac is the only  plasma membrane ca2+ transporter regulated by environmental  in gills, while the steady state expressions of pmca and ncx may accommodate the needs for transepithelial ca2+ transport under different   <cit> . however, it is also possible that the exchange activities of these and other transporters  are modulated by  through ca2+ sensing/signaling mechanisms, such as the above mentioned activation by cabps or cytoskeleton reorganization. for instance, the main factors regulating pmca activity in eukaryotes appear to be ca2+-bound cam and phosphorylation by protein kinases a/c, but recent evidence in human erythrocyte membranes also point to effects of the interaction with actin cytoskeleton elements on pmca activity  <cit> .

additional ion homeostasis related genes were found to be significantly regulated by water ca2+ levels , including four members of the large multi-gene family of tight-junction proteins claudins , which have been implicated in the maintenance of hydromineral balance across osmoregulatory epithelia of euryhaline fishes  <cit> . it has been suggested that a decline in their expression may be related to the reshaping of the gill epithelia of euryhaline fish upon sw-acclimation and account for its "leakier"  properties. for example, both cldn8d and cldn3a expression were reduced in a salinity-dependent manner during t. nigroviridis acclimation for  <dig> weeks to fw and sw  <cit> . in tilapia and flounder gills cldn <dig> proteins were reduced 4- <dig> days after fw-sw transfer and increased after sw-fw transfer  <cit> . in our study a decrease in cldn8d gill mrna expression was detected after  <dig> h exposure to low and high  water compared to control water, while the expression of cldn3a was rapidly up-regulated by low  at  <dig> h and unchanged in both low and high  water at  <dig> h post-transfer. as for cldn28a and 28b no overall effects of fw-sw transfers were observed in salmon or tilapia  <cit> , but an up-regulation of cldn28a was detected in sw-fw tilapia 1- <dig> days post-transfer  <cit> . in our study cldn28b was also unaffected by water  and the slight down-regulation of cldn28a detected by supersage in lowca at  <dig> h was not confirmed by qpcr. finally, differential expression was detected for two alternative tags annotated to the fish cldn32a isoform, one of the fish cldn genes whose orthologs appear to have been lost in the mammalian lineage  <cit> , and these results provide the first evidence for regulation of its gill mrna levels in response to water ion availability. altogether, these observations suggest short-term alterations in paracellular epithelial permeability, the details of which are not very well known.

two tags annotated to α carbonic anhydrases  were up-regulated in lowca but not highca, consistent with the reported up-regulation of cah <dig> and cah <dig> mrna in zebra fish gills after 5- <dig> days exposure to soft-water  <cit> . cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrases in gills may assist in apical ion uptake by providing hco3- for apical cl-/hco3- exchanger or protons for apical na+/h+ exchanger  <cit> . their up-regulation suggests an impact of ca2+ availability in the gill uptake of other ions.

finally, one tag for the water pore aqp <dig>  a protein that localizes in the basolateral membrane of mr cells and expresses at lower level in sw than fw  <cit> , was down-regulated by both highca and lowca challenges. this could indicate lower water permeability perhaps to minimize the potential increase in paracellular permeability evidenced in the changes in cldns gene expression.

responses to low versus high water 
from the statistical analysis of differential expression, clustering and go enrichment analysis, it became evident that the most significant changes occurred in the transfer to low  at  <dig> h. whether there was an equivalent pattern of response to high  water it was not possible to confirm because it was only analyzed at  <dig> h. however, the analysis of this sage library allowed the comparison of the impacts of low vs. high water  on the gill transcriptome, summarized in figure  <dig>  it turned out that although specific biological processes may be regulated, the majority of the affected processes and genes respond to both challenges deviating from normal conditions of water ca2+ availability, although possibly with different time-frames, magnitudes and signal. for example, a large proportion of genes identified as up-regulated by lowca water at  <dig> h were down-regulated by highca water at  <dig> h, including those more highly represented in go terms, related to actin cytoskeleton, muscle contraction and citokinesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used supersage to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the gill transcriptome during the rapid responses to changes in environmental ca2+, which identified  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts. the generated transcript expression patterns provide a framework of water calcium-responsive genes in the gill during the initial response after transfer to different . this molecular response entails initial perception of alterations, activation of signaling networks and effectors and suggests active remodeling of cytoskeletal proteins during the initial acclimation process . it is also possible that some alterations of gene expression may represent disruption of calcium sensitive pathways as a result of the transfer shock which we cannot distinguish at present from those of acclimation. nevertheless, this data allows the generation of new hypotheses about the mechanisms of acclimation to environmental calcium changes, which can be tested in specific experiments  in order to refine current models of calcium transport in the gill. in addition, this study also provides a valuable diversity of novel transcripts and different transcript types which will be of great interest for further exploration.

in summary, our results indicate that when t. nigroviridis are transferred to a low calcium environment, their gills respond rapidly by up regulating genes related to ca2+ signaling/homeostasis but also actin cytoskeleton reorganization, cytokinesis and muscle contraction, which may be involved in previously described morphological adjustments in the cells where transepithelial ca2+ transport occurs, the mr cells, in response to altered ca2+ levels. genes related to energy production and energy homeostasis are also up-regulated, probably reflecting the increased energetic needs of the acclimation response. the responses to high calcium availability appear to affect the same biological processes as the low calcium challenge, although with opposite effects.
