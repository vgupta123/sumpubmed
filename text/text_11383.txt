BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis thaliana  circadian clock drives growth and development in response to daily and seasonal change  <cit> . this is of ecological relevance as the clock has been shown to be critical for plant fitness and appears to be evolving in correlation with latitude  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the clock system is proposed to be composed of integrated transcriptional feedbacks  <cit> . these loops drive global gene expression rhythms  <cit> . in fact, estimates of the total global consortium of cycling genes has ranged from 2% to 36% of all arabidopsis transcripts  <cit> . these global regulatory patterns of transcript abundance demonstrate that whole regulatory and metabolic pathways are under clock control  <cit> . this exquisitely coordinated regulation is thought to be the purpose of the clock. overall one can see an emerging, systems-level understanding of the complicated biological mechanisms composed of transcriptional networks driven by the clock. functional tests of these hypotheses are required to fully expand the integrated network.

understanding the molecular nature of the circadian oscillator is an ongoing task. within the currently understood core of the oscillator are the sequence related myb-like factors circadian clock associated  <dig>  and late elongated hypocotyl . these genes were first discovered through misexpression studies, as overexpression of either was found to generate an arrhythmic clock  <cit> . further work on these factors  <cit> , and the identification and characterization of other clock genes  <cit> , resulted in an elegant description of the rhythm-driving oscillator  <cit> . here a four-loop model has been proposed where in the core of this oscillator lies cca1/lhy and the pseudo-response regulator timing of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein  gene expression  <dig>   <cit> . this core was confirmed as the cca <dig> lhy toc <dig> triple mutant has seriously attenuated rhythmic behavior  <cit> . cca1/lhy are genetically transcriptional repressors of toc <dig>  and toc <dig> is a positive genetic factor, with an as of yet unproven biochemical function  <cit> , that functions in transcriptional induction of cca <dig> and lhy. the cca1/lhy loop is further regulated by a morning loop that contains the toc <dig> sequence-related genes pseudoresponse regurator  <dig>  and prr <dig>  in turn, the toc <dig> arm of the clock is also regulated by a loop that includes the gigantea  flowering-time gene  <cit> . current models infer as of yet unidentified transcription factors in this looped network  <cit> .

circadian-regulated transcription factors should confer the complete array of phased rhythms of transcript accumulation that is observed  <cit> . as for example, the myb-like transcription factors cca <dig> and lhy, thought core for normal clock function, are predicted to drive output regulation  <cit> . additionally, the myb-transcription factor early phytochrome responsive  <dig> , the mads-domain factor flowering locus c , and a garp transcription factor, lux arrythmo , were also reported to be involved in circadian system  <cit> . these three genes could additionally control a suite of transcript outputs from the clock. another example of the regulation of circadian outputs by clock-controlled transcription factors is the regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, where structural enzymes for this secondary metabolite are encoded by genes coordinately regulated by a cycling output transcription factor called as production of anthocyanin pigment  <dig>  pap <dig>  <cit> . thus, not all rhythmic transcription factors feedback to the oscillator. we believe it is likely that a small set of transcription factors await to be discovered that can modulate clock function, and just as importantly, we expect that a large set of transcription factors are themselves regulated at the transcript accumulation level to drive the physiological suite of rhythmic outputs.

for the circadian clock to drive rhythmic expression of such a large part of the genome, and for these genes to be phased at all times of the subjective day , a suite of transcription factors must be implicated in the clock-output system. the arabidopsis genome encodes more than  <dig> transcription factors that belong to more than  <dig> different families  <cit> . each family of transcription factors was characterized based on the definition of containing a highly conserved dna-binding domain. for example, the arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> members of myb transcription factor superfamily,  <dig> genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors,  <dig> distinct members of basic region/leucine zipper motif  transcription factors  <cit> . some transcription factors were reported as activators and repressors to compose complexly integrated regulatory loops in the plant circadian system  <cit> . however, functional characterization of the vast majority of arabidopsis transcription factors still remains.

here, we took two overlapping genomic approaches to further catalog the repertoire of transcription factor use within the oscillator and in expression of output traits. these companion approaches identify previously uncharacterized plant genes involved in the circadian system, and further dissects this complex signaling network. for this, we surveyed existing microarray results of the myb, bhlh, and bzip transcription factor families and determined those that are clock regulated, and separately, systematically analyzed circadian rhythms in misexpression mutants targeting transcription factors, via time-lapse imaging. we report the discovery of three misexpression lines that have altered circadian parameters. our suite of analyses lead us to conclude that although many transcription factors do not contribute to normal clock function, transcription factors previously non-described within the clock can be discovered through systematic tests, including computational surveys.

RESULTS
defining circadian expression within transcription-factor families
as suites of transcripts are clock regulated in arabidopsis  <cit> , we hypothesized that this was due to rhythmic accumulation of transcription factors. myb, bhlh, and bzip are the predominant factor families previously implicated in light- and clock-regulated accumulation of targets  <cit> , so we decided to test how prevalent individual rhythms are within these families. previously, we have collectively reported no less than  <dig> genes predicted to encode transcription factors in the myb , bhlh , and bzip  transcription factor families in arabidopsis  <cit> ; these were the target pools queried. we accessed expression profiles of circadian experiments, nascarrays experiment reference number: nascarrays- <dig>  <cit> , using affymetrix ath <dig> arrays containing  <dig>  probe sets in the public microarray database, genevestigator  <cit> . this probe set represents  <dig> myb,  <dig> bhlh, and  <dig> bzip genes. in these circadian datasets, a total of  <dig> of these genes  were found to be expressed at least one time point . we noticed that the expression of more than half of myb genes was below detection level on these hybridization samples. perhaps this implies that many myb transcripts in this experimental protocol were tissue or growth-stage specific. in contrast, most bhlh and bzip genes were detected in this array experiment. the expression data we processed from these  <dig> genes was sufficient for further in silico analyses.

we scored the expression values of the  <dig> genes using the modified cosinor analysis  <cit> . this analysis was used successfully in previous experiments to score the circadian expression for genes in drosophila, mouse, and arabidopsis  <cit> . a previous study using this approach in arabidopsis employed three threshold scales of significance to assess probability : <  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   <cit> . we used the same confidence cut-offs to define rhythmic genes . a total of  <dig> transcription factor genes with a pmmc-β value of  <dig> , which reflected  <dig> myb,  <dig> bhlh, and  <dig> bzip transcription factors, were scored as rhythmic . the percentages of rhythmic bhlh and bzip genes within each respective family were similar to, or even slightly higher than, that of the set of "all" genes . the percentage of rhythmic myb genes was less than that of the bhlh, bzip, and the set of all genes; however, noteworthy is the percentage of expressed-myb on the array that was, itself, lower than other sets. a graphic representation of the expression patterns illustrates when a given peak occurred during transcription factor oscillation  hours relative to zeitgeber time, which is the time of the last external temporal cue such as the dawn signal of lights-on), . it was noted that many bzip genes were transcribed during the photophase of the day, whereas many myb genes peaked during the skotophase . these collective results highlight that, as expected, many transcription factors oscillate, and do so at many discreet phases of the daily cycle.

circadian function of transcription factors
in the in silico analysis , we found several night-expressed transcription factors. we wondered if such transcription factors could be the as of yet unidentified clock components proposed by current models  <cit> . to generically test this hypothesis, we surveyed t-dna tagged lines targeting these transcription factors, obtained from the public stock center, and measured circadian rhythms of these mutants in our system. however, no strong alternations of the circadian rhythm were observed in any of these lines under our assay condition . our observation suggested that none of these factors are the predicted clock element, and thus alternative approaches must be used to define such circadian mutants.

to identify transcription factors that function within the circadian system, as part of control or slave oscillator, we assessed rhythmic output of lines targeted to misexpress a given transcription factor. these experiments, because they are overexpression studies, allowed us to circumvent genetic redundancy. we feel that this is a particularly important consideration in the arabidopsis clock, as the mybrelated sequences cca <dig> and lhy have strong circadian defects when overexpressed  <cit> , but have only mild phenotypes as single gene loss-of-function alleles because of the redundancy inherent in the system,  <cit> . our hypothesis was that members of the myb, bhlh, and bzip families are as of yet uncharacterized components of the oscillator and/or are slave components. as a test of this hypothesis, we made use of  <dig> plants over-expressing  <dig> myb genes,  <dig> bhlh genes, and  <dig> bzip genes . overexpression of each transcription factor was confirmed by rt-pcr on rosette leaf cdna from t <dig> plants .

we constructed a high-throughput time-lapse imaging system, similar to one previously reported  <cit> . with this system, we measured the circadian rhythms of leaf movement in each transgenic line. for this, the seedlings were entrained under 24-hour light-dark cycles for ~ <dig> days, and then the leaf positions of individual plants were imaged under constant light  for an additional  <dig> days. the circadian parameters of the change in leaf position were analyzed . we found  <dig> misexpressors with circadian phenotypes, and  <dig> out of  <dig> misexpressor lines targeted the three genes myb3r <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> . myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox displayed a 4– <dig> hour delayed phase of leaf movement rhythms . statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in circadian periodicity , while the phase difference was significant . bhlh92-ox plants exhibited a  <dig> ~ <dig> hour lengthened periodicity phenotype, compared to the wild type . the periodicity differences were statistically significant; wt,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; bhlh92-ox line a,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; line b,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; line d,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; line e,  <dig>  ±  <dig>   . thus, myb3r <dig> and bhlh <dig> controls circadian phase, and bhlh <dig> contributes to the regulation of circadian periodicity.

during imaging experiments, we identified additional phenotypically altered lines in the pools of misexpression transgenics . a total of  <dig> over-expression lines exhibited aberrant periodicity, and one of the bzipox plants  lacked clock precision. however, phenotypes from these lines were not confirmed by other lines targeting the over-expression of the same gene. one plausible explanation is that these detected phenotypes are not correlated to the targeted gene, and perhaps was caused by coincident mutations occurring during tdna transformation.

myb3r <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> could influence circadian rhythms
to confirm the clock phenotypes observed in myb3r <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> over-expression lines, we employed the promoter:luciferase  system as an assay that here is used to detect rhythmic patterns of gene expression  <cit> . luc fusions to the well-characterized circadian-regulated promoter, cca <dig> and to the cold-and circadian-regulated  <dig>  promoter were separately introduced into these myb3r2-ox, bhlh69-ox and bhlh92-ox plants via fertilization. if these transcription factors act upstream of the clock, both cca <dig> and ccr <dig> oscillations would be altered. alternatively, if these genes act downstream, controlling the output pathway that regulates leaf movement, the cca <dig> rhythm intimately associated with clock function would not be affected. myb3r2-ox exhibited delayed phase phenotypes of both cca <dig> and ccr <dig> rhythms under ll . bhlh69-ox also delayed the phase of the cca <dig> and ccr <dig> rhythm . in our mathematical analysis, we could not find any significant effects on the circadian periodicity . the second peak positions of cca <dig> rhythms in control, myb3r2-ox, bhlh69-ox and bhlh92-ox were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively . p-values for myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox were less than  <dig> , while p-value for bhlh92-ox was  <dig> . in the second peaks of ccr <dig> rhythm, the values in control, myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . thus, we found that overexpression of myb3r <dig> and bhlh <dig> altered both cca <dig> and ccr <dig> rhythms, suggesting that these genes can control core-clock functions, rather than being specific to the leaf-movement-output pathway.

we measured cca <dig> and ccr <dig> rhythms in myb3r2-ox, bhlh69-ox, and bhlh92-ox plants in constant darkness  . this allows us to compare their behavior to the ll phenotypes. interestingly, myb3r2-ox plants had an advanced phased ccr <dig> rhythm and a delayed phase of cca <dig> expression in dd . the peak positions in control and myb3r2-ox were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the ccr <dig> rhythm, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the cca <dig> rhythm  . a delayed phase of cca <dig> in dd was seen in bhlh69-ox lines  . bhlh92-ox plants also exhibited a clock phenotype in dd. here an effect on cca <dig> phase was detected . the values were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . we thus concluded that misexpression of any of these three transcription factors could alter clock parameters. however, the specific nature of the phenotypic effects depended on the light conditions and the output measured.

myb3r <dig> and bhlh <dig> could alter clock-gene expression
as described above, we detected circadian alternations when misexpressing given transcription factors. because the effect of bhlh92-ox was dependent on the light condition, we continued our focus on myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox to further characterize the molecular basis for their phenotypes. to this end, we analyzed transcripts of the central oscillator genes cca <dig>  lhy, toc <dig>  and gi in myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox . the myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox plants were entrained under  <dig> hour light/ <dig> hour dark cycles, and then transferred to constant light conditions. replicate samples from these plants were harvested every  <dig> hours for rna isolation and expression analysis using reverse transcriptase -pcr. both myb3r2-ox and bhlh69-ox were found to result in a repressed transcript level of lhy and toc <dig> . cca <dig> mrna was found to be slightly decreased in myb3r2-ox, while this was increased in bhlh69-ox . interestingly, in bhlh69-ox, induction of gi expression was found to display a nearly opposite phase with high expression level . at zeitgeber time  =  <dig>  lhy and cca <dig> mrna are highly accumulated in myb3r2-ox. this response could be accounted for by an acute light response. alternatively, a phase delay or defective entrainment in myb3r2-ox might cause the high expression seen at this time-point. interestingly, the alteration in gi expression did not result in a dramatic alteration in the timing of the floral induction . we suggested that myb3r <dig> functions as a regulator of cca <dig>  lhy, or toc <dig> transcription, and suggest that bhlh <dig> plays a similarly important role to regulate cca <dig> and gi expression.

we next investigated whether the myb3r <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> genes were transcribed in a circadian manner. we performed this experiment as the expression profiles of these three genes were not part of the publicly available datasets described above  <cit> . the mrna accumulation patterns of these transcription factors were assayed by rt-pcr from rna extracted from plants grown under light-dark cycles and then transferred to ll . myb3r <dig> and bhlh <dig> were likely to be expressed in a circadian manner with a peak between late night and dawn. in contrast, the mrna accumulation of bhlh <dig> was not found to oscillate.

discussion
identification of previously functionally uncharacterized transcription factors in the clock
here we describe that myb3r <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> can contribute to the plant-circadian system. alongside the characterized transcription factors cca <dig>  lhy, epr <dig>  flc, and lux, this now adds to the list of transcriptional clock-modulators. we provide evidence that myb3r <dig> and bhlh <dig> influences circadian phase, whereas bhlh <dig> influences phase and periodicity, dependent on environmental conditions. these effects were not as strong as misexpression of cca <dig>  lhy, or lux. it is still unclear how myb3r <dig>  bhlh <dig>  and bhlh <dig> function in the clock system. their specific effects depended on the light environment and on the output measured. expression analysis showed that misexpression of myb3r <dig> and bhlh <dig> resulted in altered transcript levels of clock genes; however, the circadian rhythms still kept 24-h periodicity albeit with aberrant phase. thus, transcription factors identified here may play a role in environmental input to the clock or the mediation of its effects, rather than functioning as central-clock components. such processes are described  <cit> . a future effort to explore a detailed analysis of these transcription factors and the identification of target dna elements remains to be carried out.

plant circadian systems possess interlocked feedback loops  <cit> . in addition, there are various junctures for signal convergence and divergence in the input and output pathways  <cit> . though a set of clock regulating transcription factors has already been identified sufficient to describe much of the oscillator framework  <cit> , many other components are believed to still be lacking  <cit> .

we described an additional  <dig> misexpression lines that exhibit altered clock phenotypes. whether these genes are components of input core, or output pathways, is as of yet unknown. this was as the phenotypes detected in these lines were not substantiated with alternative transgenic inserts. forward-genetic analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes of these lines is worth further attention to determine their function in the clock.

a current mathematical model proposes the existence of an unknown transcription factor "x", which activates cca <dig> and lhy  <cit> . we tested hundreds of transcription factors as a pilot study of functional phenomics within the circadian clock, but it appears that in this test, we did not find "factor x." still, functional analysis of more than a thousand transcription factors still remains. thus, our pilot efforts substantiate that it is worthwhile to interrogate, via further functional genomic efforts, all known arabidopsis transcription factors and to analyze their circadian responses.

transcriptional networks in clock output pathways
to dissect the transcriptional regulation in circadian clock, we employed a systematic analysis of global-gene expression. in our in silico analysis, up to 20% of the transcription factors assayed were clock controlled . this percentage is slightly higher than that of "all" circadian rhythmic genes in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . this implies that the circadian oscillations in the output pathways are not just regulated by a select group of transcriptional feedbacks, and actually require a large number of rhythmic transcription factors. in contrast, the mammalian system is reported to only use around  <dig> cycling transcription factors, which oscillate in a circadian manner, to regulate the clock  <cit> . the evolution of transcription-factor function and recruitment of molecular targets leads to the linking of many processes of plant physiology to the circadian system. some components of these systems direct the clock itself, whereas others are only components of rhythmic physiological outputs.

CONCLUSIONS
here we employed two genomic approaches as a pilot study to explore clock function. we found three genes that could modulate circadian parameters. many other transcription factors oscillated in a circadian manner. this implicates these factors in physiological circadian outputs. further exploration, with our described approaches, should bring novel insights in circadian input and output pathways, and identify genes previously non-described as functional within the central-clock oscillator.
