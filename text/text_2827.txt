BACKGROUND
non-coding rnas  complement the function of protein-coding genes in housekeeping and cell regulatory mechanisms. a comprehensive annotation of ncrnas in newly sequenced genomes therefore contributes to the identification of relevant features of each evolutionary lineage, and is relevant for understanding specific biological processes of the organisms.

in organisms with complex tissue organization as animals or plants, micrornas  regulate the expression of large array of genes and affect a wide variety of biological processes. they have accumulated during metazoan evolution through an ongoing process de novo innovation . although losses of mirna families is more common than previously considered  <cit> , a most recent comprehensive study of mirna across metazoan phyla elucidated specific lineages in which gains of mirna families could be associated to bursts of innovation  <cit> . for example, within the nematoda considerable gains of mirnas occurred in the rhabditid lineage, and within the chordata, gains occurred in the cephalochordates, vertebrates and eutherians  <cit> . in contrast, within nematoda losses occurred in the enoplean lineage, whereas in the chordata losses occurred in the tunicata  <cit> . these results are suggestive of the involvement of mirna in the evolution of morphological complex traits  <cit> , or alternatively losses of mirnas leading to simplified traits  <cit> . the direct mechanisms and causative inferences to test this hypothesis, however, remain to be studied.

eight tunicate genomes have been published, including the pelagic and solitary thaliacean or larvacean oikopleura dioica  <cit>  and seven ascidian species: three solitary phlebobranch ciona species ; three solitary stolidobranch molgula species, two of which have tailless larvae  <cit> ; and the colonial stolidobranch botryllus schlosseri  <cit> . five additional genomes have been sequenced, including two solitary stolidobranch halocynthia species and two solitary phlebobranch phallussia species that are currently in assembly  <cit> , as well as the draft genome of the colonial aplousobranch didemnum vexillum  that is the subject of this study. solitary tunicates have some of the smallest metazoan genomes. the o. dioica genome is about  <dig> mb, . the colonial tunicates show threefold larger genomes . although gene expression patterns and regulatory networks of developmental processes are generally conserved among tunicates and vertebrates, substantial change has been reported for cis-regulatory regions, which differ considerably even among closely related species  <cit> . it is not known whether the rapid rate of evolution and mutational change observed for cis-regulatory regions in the non-coding regions of tunicate genomes is related to the rapid rate of loss of tunicate mirnas, as well as to fast evolution of other ncrnas.

tunicates exhibit an atypically evolutionary plastic repertoire of mirnas. in contrast to most other animal phyla, entire mirna families are readily lost, while at the same time there is also extensive gain of lineage-specific families. the changes of the mirna complement are most extreme in o. dioica  <cit>  but can also be observed to a lesser degree in c. intestinalis  and molgula sp.  <cit> .

in addition to gains and losses, several evolutionary ancient families have diverged far enough in sequence that they are no longer easily recognizable. for example, the “tunicate specific” mir- <dig> family has diverged substantially but can be traced back to the mir- <dig> family that dates back to the bilaterian ancestor  <cit> . another particularity related to the plastic repertoire of mirnas in ciona, which may also occur in other tunicates, relates to the expression of stable and conserved forms of microrna-offset rnas  that are are processed from extended mirna precursors  <cit>  using the intrinsic mirna machinery. although mors are also present in human  <cit> , they seem to be particularly abundant in tunicates. the reorganization of the tunicate mirna system is likely linked to major lineage-specific changes in developmental pathways.

beyond mirnas, much less in known about other tunicate ncrnas. to continue the characterization of additional ncrnas, in this study we complement other homology based approaches, furthermore, have identified some housekeeping rnas, such as rrnas  <cit> , nuclear rnas  <cit> , or the 7sk rna  <cit> . in this study we generate computational approaches to resolve the poor conservation of ncrnas, as has already been documented between the distantly related ciona and oikopleura by a computational survey for conserved structured elements  <cit> .

in the late 20th century d. vexillum  has spread worldwide from its native range in the nw pacific  <cit>  and has shown to be a highly successful invader species. in many locations it has become a serious ecological and economical threat as it rapidly covers extensive areas of different substrata  <cit> , such as along the sea floor or man-made artificial floats and oyster crates  <cit> . as a consequence d. vexillum has received much attention among study cases of marine bio-invasions due to its rapid and aggressive expansion. studies that focus on the adaptive or reproductive potential of this species have only recently been published, and many questions remain the life history and biology of this organism. for this reason, genomic studies of this species may reveal important aspects that make this species such a successful invader.

here we focus on the annotation and analysis of the ncrnas of the preliminary draft genome of d. vexillum that has been recently sequenced. this tunicate is of particular interest not only to understand the invasive potential of this organism at the genomic level, but also to reveal potential ncrnas related to the evolution of coloniality and budding in the tunicates. the analysis of the ncrna repertoire of d. vexillum in comparison with other tunicate genomes provides key resource for further investigations into the regulation of progenitor cells and tissues involved in asexual means of reproduction or budding, as well in processes of regeneration.

RESULTS
preliminary draft of the genome assembly of d. vexillum

sequencing data utilized for this first de novo assembly was derived from one experiment of next generation sequencing described in the methods. the preliminary draft genome assembly of d. vexillum comprises  <dig>  mb of sequence distributed across  <dig>  <dig> unscaffolded contigs with n <dig> size of  <dig> nt . from the total amount of sequenced dna  we estimate a coverage of approximately 30×. about  <dig>  % of the assembly is contained in contigs less than  <dig> kb in length; the maximum contig length is just above  <dig> kb, see details in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  since ncrnas are typically shorter than 200nt and unspliced, the short contig sizes do not pose a substantial problem for our purposes. the gc content across all the contigs is about  <dig> . nucleotide correlation between g:c has a positive tendency contrary to the observed trend in the other nucleotide pairwise comparisons. g:c frequency distribution reports a median of  <dig> ± <dig>  and in a:t the median is  <dig> ± <dig> . more detailed data are compiled in additional file 1: figures s <dig> and s <dig>  correspondingly. the preliminary draft assembly can be accessed and searched at http://tunicata.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/.

homology search
a homology-based search of the draft genome of d. vexillum with  <dig>  <dig> metazoan-specific models from the rfam  database as query resulted in annotations for  <dig> rna families, among them  <dig> ribosomal rnas,  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> small nucleolar rnas,  <dig> small nuclear rnas,  <dig> miscellaneous rnas and  <dig> long non-coding rna. table  <dig> provides a detailed statistical overview of the annotation. the correctness of these annotation was confirmed using several different computational strategies, including sequence comparisons with blast, hidden markov models, and finally metazoan-specific covariance models derived from standard seed alignments of rfam database. instead of simply employing a single-step annotation using infernal/rfam as in the ncrnas annotations provided by ensembl we employed here a multi-stage pipeline geared towards increased sensitivity.
“families” refers to different ncrnas, while loci refer to different position in the draft genome



the current annotation refers to an early draft of the d. vexillum genome. to facilitate its reuse with later genome version, additional files  <dig> and  <dig> report the sequences of all identified ncrnas and rna elements as well as parseable stockholm alignments.

homology search with multiple blast strategies
preliminary studies showed that several ncrnas, among them ubiquitous snrnas, were not readily identified in the d. vexillum draft genome by means of simple blast or infernal searches. this observation was not unexpected given the large phylogenetic distances and the volatile evolution of at least some ncrna families briefly outlined in the introduction. we therefore resorted to an initial search that was optimized for sensitivity and combined  <dig> different blast-based search strategies following the suggestions of  <cit> , . this resulted in a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> candidate hits which were then stringently filtered in terms of both sequence and secondary structure. after cross-validation with covariance models from rfam database  we retained  <dig> families of ncrnas, distributed as follow:  <dig> rrnas families,  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> snornas,  <dig> snrnas, and  <dig> miscellaneous rnas. in this set the families covering the largest number of genomic loci was the spliceosomal u <dig> snrna detected  <dig> times.

-r: reward for a nucleotide match, -q: penalty for a nucleotide mismatch, -g: cost to open a gap, -e: expectation value, -e: cost to extend a gap, -w: word size. the theoretical frequency , is the expected frequency according to the established parameters  <cit> . the strategies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were suggested by  <cit> , while the others were modifications of the strategies written parentheses, according to  <cit> . the ‘default’ strategy represents the predetermined parameters for blastn program



homology search using hmms
profile hmms were run on the d. vexillum genome; initial candidates where then subjected to several filtering steps to remove false positive hits: regions that contain significant candidates by sequence alignments against any of the positive  <dig> profile hmms were found. after, the cross validation of covariance models on the d. vexillum genome  <dig> ncrna non-redundant candidates were found. these set of candidates are divided into the following categories: mirnas , rrnas , snrnas  and snornas  and  <dig> lncrna. the ncrna families with the largest number of distinct loci are u <dig>  and u <dig> .

comparison of search strategies
the comparison of results of the two homology strategies shows that the ncrnas searches require multiple combination of computational strategies to detect the diversity of structural motive of the rna families. less well-conserved families, such as mir- <dig>  or rmst  <dig>  were detected only by the hmms strategy. the hmm approach however missed mirnas such as mir- <dig>  or the metazoan srp , which are easily detectable with the blast strategies. the hmms were also more efficient in particular with snrnas, while blast-based strategies were efficient with rrnas.

in order to evaluate the relative performance of the different blast strategies we determined their sensitivity and specificity, see fig.  <dig>  the strategies used in this study were good predictors of true candidates of snrnas and rrnas with probabilities ≥ <dig>  for finding the true positive candidates. strategy  <dig>  performed best for mirna and snornas loci. in general the sensitivity is limited for the class of miscellaneous rnas; here strategy  <dig> gave the best results, see  <dig>  the specificity of our approach is very close to  <dig> , except for rrnas, which require manual curation to avoid false positive reports from the blast strategies.

non-coding rna genes in the d. vexillum genome
mirnas
micrornas are well known regulators of post-transcriptional gene regulation. the evolutionary ancient families such as let- <dig> are involved in spatio-temporal regulation of developmental processes. the major changes in tunicate body-plans compared to their deuterostome ancestors seem to be closely linked to major changes in their mirna repertoire  <cit> . the annotated mirnas are summarized in fig.  <dig> together with the species in which homologs are annotated.
fig.  <dig> the plot summarizes simultaneously the mirnas families detected on this survey and the source data that supports their prediction. the mirna families and data source are represented by segments on the circle. mirna families are arranged to the right side of the circle and species from which queries belong to or the hmm method used to search for homologous in d. vexillum are arranged around the left side. the source data is shown as merged lines originating from each species or the hmm method to its supported candidate in d. vexillum. candidate location names are presented on the blue inside of the circle. every small square under each gray band represents species or the hmm method that supports the candidate detection; they are coloured according to different taxa or method: yellow for vertebrate species, blue for basal chordates species, green for invertebrates or the single-celled organism and red for the de novo hmm method. tags are anolis carolinensis , branchiostoma floridae , caenorhabditis elegans , ciona intestinalis , ciona savignyi , danio rerio , latimeria chalumnae , oikopleura dioica , petromyzon marinus , saccharomyces cerevisiae , xenopus tropicalis , and  to the hmms strategy. as one example, the mir- <dig> family was detected for queries of  <dig> vertebrate species  and basal chordates ; locus located on the contig dvex <dig> supported by  and of two basal chordates , dvex <dig> by two vertebrates  and one basal chordate , dvex <dig> by  and dvex <dig> by . notice that mir- <dig> was only predicted by the hmm strategy and none candidates were supported by queries from s. cerevisiae or the tunicate species o. dioica. mir- were supported only by basal chordate data source



covariance models were built with the sequences from metazoan species to obtain  <dig> specific to mirnas. not surprisingly, the mirnas retrieved by means of blast are preferentially obtained with queries from x. tropicalis , c. intestinalis  and a. carolinensis . for several mirna families we observe multiple genomic locations, e.g. mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , mir- <dig> , and mir- <dig> . using the hmms strategy, we could found  <dig> families of mirnas with the most putative paralogs are: mir- <dig> , mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> . the ancestral organisms before tunicate emergence, we could find candidates of mirnas that belong from c. elegans and b. floridae; because s. cerevisiae does not have mirna annotations reported in ensembl database. the ancestral set is represented only by let- <dig> family that had been detected with queries from the most of species used in the homology searches. other wide conserved mirnas according our strategy are: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> due their presence in organisms from chordate clade . the key mirnas shared between o. dioica and the ciona species,  are also present in d. vexillum with the exception of mir- <dig>  as expected mir- <dig> alongside mir- <dig> in cluster dating back to the bilaterian ancestor  <cit> , but it could not be associated due the fragmentation of genome. it regulates myogenesis and is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle cells  <cit> .

small nucleolar rnas
the specific set of snornas on d. vexillum genome are represented by  <dig> covariance models, all belong from c/d snornas, which report the highest value of loci  by snord <dig>  this candidate, together with snord <dig>  snord <dig> and u <dig> snornas, were validated by default and metazoan-specific covariance models. it is very unlikely that the  <dig> genes detected in this survey are the complete snorna complement of d. vexillum. most likely the fact that snornas have not been systematically investigated in tunicates and their relatively poor sequence conservation severely limits the sensitivity of our survey.

ribosomal rnas
from the detected rrna set, we found  <dig> of the  <dig> covariance models searched on d. vexillum genome. we annotated  <dig> loci for the 5s rrna. the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit was identified in  <dig> loci. both the default and the metazoan-specific covariance models identify a 18s rrna,  as a locus comprising  <dig> nucleotides. the large ribosomal subunit  was found in  <dig> loci, but the evaluation by the rfam covariance models  reported about  <dig> additional candidates, but their length were not enough to be consider as true candidates. the complete ribosomal rna operon is located on the single contig dvex <dig>  to discard suspicious candidates among the  <dig> 5s rrna loci, structural alignments and comparisons with the current loci in c. intestinalis , c. savignyi  and b. schlosseri  were performed using rnaalifold  <cit> , resulting in a best estimate of  <dig> intact 5s rrna genes .

small nuclear rnas
the spliceosome involved several highly structured small nuclear rnas. our survey identified multiple copies. as usual, most of the snrna components of the major spliceosome appear in multiple copies: u <dig> , u <dig> , u <dig> , u <dig> . on the u <dig> snrna appears to be single copy gene. the minor spliceosome, which is absent in o. dioica  <cit>  is clearly present in d. vexillum as there are two copies u <dig> and a single copy each of the u4atac, u6atac, and u <dig> snrnas. candidate predictions are listed in additional file 5: s <dig> 

one copy of both, the highly conserved srp rna  and rnase p rna   were also identified. the rnase mrp rna was found in two loci. a single locus harbors the 7sk snrna.

transfer rnas
the d. vexillum genome contains  <dig> trnas and an additional  <dig> trna pseudogenes as determined by trnascan-se. these decode all standard aminoacids . the most common anti-codon is trnasec with  <dig> genes and the rarest is trnacys with only  <dig> copies. not all anti-codons, however, are represented by their own trna. for the following seven anti-codons we did not detect a corresponding trna: trnaasp-atc, trnahis-atg, trnacys-aca, trnagly-acc, trnaser-act, trnaphe-aaa and trnatyr-ata.
fig.  <dig> summary of the d. vexillum trnas genes. pie charts indicate the fraction of the different anti-codons within each isoacceptor family



there is also no candidate for a trnasupressor-cta. the extremely large number trnasec is highly unusual. it appears as a single-copy gene in many eukaryotes and even in the large vertebrate genomes there are no more than about  <dig> copies as a search in the gtrnadb  <cit>  shows. in other tunicates no unusual proliferation of trnasec genes was observed .

both the total number of trnas and the anti-codon frequencies vary considerably between tunicates. the missing anti-codons are specific to d. vexillum. on the other hand, trnahis-gtg, trnaile-gat, trnalys-ttt, trnaphe-gaa, trnathr-ggt, and trnaval-gac are substantially more abundant in d. vexillum than in other tunicates, and d. vexillum is the only tunicate with a trnapro-ggg trna . the number of  <dig> pseudogenes is exceptional among tunicates, where the largest number reported so far is  <dig> pseudogenes in b. schlosseri. for comparison, the vertebrate l. chalumnae features  <dig>  <dig> trna pseudogenes .

to evaluate whether trna genes have a tendency to aggregate in genomic clusters, we followed the strategy implemented to study trna gene organization in other eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . almost  <dig> % of the d. vexillum tdnas are not grouped into clusters, similar to the situation o. dioica and in contrast to the c. intestinalis and b. schlosseri  and the extreme case c. savignyi . while the other tunicates, like most other eukaryotes, predominantly form direct tandem copies, there is an elevated level of head-to-head and tail-to-tail arrangements in d. vexillum . large variations in the number of pseudogenes and organization of tdnas have previously been observed in many other clades, including primates  <cit>  and thus are not at all unexpected among tunicates.

miscellaneous rnas
we found  <dig> type of miscellaneous rnas . srp rna and rnase p have been discussed already in the section on snrnas. among the rna elements, we had found a single k10_tls element . since the k <dig> transport/localization element that is thought to be drosophila-specific we suspect that this is a false positive hit. the hmm strategy furthermore resulted in hits to  <dig> families of bacteria and archaea sequences, which we removed from  <dig> d. vexillum fragments because they are most likely contaminations and or false positive hits.

long non-coding rnas
the scope of lncrna annotations by homology is very limited due to their low levels of sequence conservation. the rfam database therefore lists only a small number of well-conserved elements. the hmm-based search identified a plausible homolog of rmst  <dig>  the conserved region  <dig> of the rhabdomyosarcoma  <dig> associated transcript, which has been associated with neurogenesis processes by its interaction with sox <dig>  <cit> . to check whether this surprising hit is likely to be a true positive we also investigated the genomes of c. intestinalis, c. savignyi, b. schlosseri and b. floridae and found putative homologs with p<10− <dig> and cmsearch identifies these sequences with e<10− <dig>  the corresponding multiple sequence alignment can be found in additional file 5: s <dig>  at least parts of the rmst lncrna are thus conserved across chordates, making it one of the best conserved lncrnas.

mitochondrial rna genes
the sequences of two clades of d. vexillum were reported recently  <cit>  . both contain two ribosomal rnas and  <dig> trna genes. in addition to the expected two distinct mt-trna-leu and mt-trna-ser genes, the mt-trna-gly and mt-trna-met appears in two loci. we compared these sequences to the draft genome assembly and found that most candidates are located on the contigs dvex <dig> and dvex <dig>  the latter hosts both mitochondrial rrnas. based on pairwise alignments of rlsu sequences of clade a and b to the draft genome, we observed near perfect sequence identity between the draft genome and the clade a mitogenome, while the clade b mt-rrna show  <dig> – <dig> % divergence. the sequenced d. vexillum genome thus clearly belongs to clade a. the mitochondrial contigs are provided as additional file  <dig> 

comparative analysis of the distribution of snornas and mirnas of d. vexillum and other tunicates
predicted mirnas, snrnas, and snornas of d. vexillum were compared with other metazoan species including other tunicates using dollo parsimony  <cit>  implemented in count  <cit>  to reconstruct the corresponding gene family history. the inferred gain and loss events are summarized in . in order to determine the presence or absence of a family at the nodes representing the ancestor of olfactores, chordata, etc., we used all available information, not only the ncrna complement of the representative vertebrate or lophotrochozoan species.

as expected, the snrna complement is highly conserved throughout metazoans, with the notable loss of the minor spliceosome in o. dioica  <cit> . in the lamprey p. marinus no homolog of the u <dig> snrna has been identified so far. as expected, nematode-specific smy rnas involved in trans-splicing were observed only in c. elegans  <cit> . in our searches in the b. schlosseri or o. dioica genomes we did not find homologs of the 7sk rna , which is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation via p-tefb and rna polymerase ii  <cit> . however, we suspect that these absences reflect limitations of our homology search, and not true losses.

our analyses show a sharp contrast between the repertoire of snornas in the genome of the metazoan ancestor and the chordate ancestor. snornas are generally involved in rna processing  <cit> . only  <dig> snornas could be identified unambiguously in the bilaterian ancestor, whereas  <dig> snornas were predicted for the chordate ancestor . similar numbers of snorna families were maintained in the amphioxus b. floridae , whereas olfactores gained approximately  <dig> snornas and lost  <dig>  within this group, we observed remarkably large losses of snorna families in tunicata , in contrast to  <dig> loss and  <dig> gains in the craniata . within the tunicata, o. dioica showed relatively high losses  compared to  <dig> losses in ascidians. colonial ascidians b. schlosseri and d. vexillum showed further losses  and currently contain a repertoire of  <dig> and  <dig> snornas respectively. in contrast, solitary ciona species contain  <dig> snornas. the well-conserved u <dig> snorna was found in all species analyzed, suggesting its important role in the 18s rrna processing and ssu ribosome formation  <cit> . specific losses in the tunicates include loss of snord <dig> and snord <dig> in o. dioica, and loss of snord <dig> and snord <dig> in ascidians . d. vexillum has lost  <dig> families compared to dvex-cin-csa clade . again we cannot rule out that some of the losses are artifacts of the draft genome assembly. in addition, snornas evolve fairly rapidly so that some of these may have diverged so fast that they are no longer recognizable. it is an intriguing question for future research whether many snornas in tunicata have become dispensable and have been lost in tunicata or whether they they have evolved so rapidly that they are not detectable with present-day homology search methods. in either case it will be interesting to study how the changes in the snorna repertoire affect rna regulatory mechanisms in the tunicata.

a comparative analysis of mirnas families in tunicates is summarized in fig. 5c and d. we find several patterns of recognizable trends as we analyze the conservation, loss and gain of mirna families in tunicates compared to selected bilaterians. for instance, based in our analysis of conserved mirna families across the bilaterians, we estimate that ancestor of the bilateria likely contained approximately  <dig> mirna families. in contrast, the ancestor of the chordata presumably contained members of  <dig> mirna families. in the cephalochordate b. floridae, we find the occurrence of a unique repertoire of  <dig> mirna families that evolved as a consequence of many gains , but also some losses   <cit> . in the ancestor of olfactores we presume the presence of  <dig> mirna families, of which tunicates did not show losses, with the notable exception of o. dioica that has undergone substantial losses . within the ascidians, only b. schlosseri and c. savignyi show dramatic losses of mirna families, − <dig> and − <dig> respectively. d. vexillum has lost  <dig> mirna families. d. vexillum shows  <dig> families that are absent in other tunicates i.e. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . comparisons of the mirnas repertoires between the colonial tunicates  on the one hand, and solitary tunicates  on the other hand, show  <dig> microrna families, i.e. mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> that are specific to colonial tunicates, while only  <dig> families, i.e. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  are specific to olitary tunicates. it is worthwhile exploring how colonial specific mirnas may have been co-opted in ascidians to function in somatic stem cell function, regeneration, budding, or other asexual developmental processes, as mirnas are know to be important players in stem cell function, and developmental processes of differentiation in vertebrates  <cit> .

in the selected craniate species analyzed, we find instances of mirna family gains as has been previously suggested  <cit> , but we also find many losses. we find substantial gains before the ancestor of the craniata , before the ancestor of gnathostomata , and in the lizard a. carolinensis , and observe losses in p. marinus , d. rerio , l. chalumnae , x. tropicalis , and a. carolinensis . overall, the general trend observed in chordata is an increased number of mirna families in gnathostomes when compared to lamprey  and the tunicates that have undergone substantial loss.

CONCLUSIONS
the survey of ncrnas in the tunicate d. vexillum reported here shows an overall picture that is not unexpected for a tunicate genome. after many extensively curation steps we were able to identify most of the expected “housekeeping ncrnas”. high-quality ncrna annotation of the first draft of the d. vexillum genome comprises  <dig> mirnas, <dig> ribosomal rnas,  <dig> trnas ,  <dig> snrnas,  <dig> snornas, and  <dig> other rna family. additionally,  <dig> families of mitochondrial trnas and  <dig> of mitochondrial ribosomal rnas and  <dig> long non-coding rna.

in line with other tunicate genome except o. dioica  <cit> , there is a minor spliceosome in d. vexillum. not surprising, some of the most rapidly evolving and thus most difficult to find ncrnas could not be identified. this concerns in particular the telomerase rna and the short vault and y rnas. we interpret these negative results as limits on the sensitivity of our homology search, not as true losses.

while many of the evolutionary ancient mirna families were found, our d. vexillum annotation shows noticeable differences to other tunicates. this is consistent with the substantial restructuring of the microrna content observed in the other ascidian genomes for which detailed data are available  <cit> . although some missing mirna families conceivably are artifacts of limitations of the homology search, our data clearly reflects the instability of the tunicate mirna system as a whole. the comparative analysis of the evolution of tunicate mirnas opens interesting avenues for future research.

among mirnas with lineage specific distribution there are several very interesting candidates for specific future studies into the regulation of budding and asexual reproduction . the micrornas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which are found only in colonial tunicates, act as tumor suppressors or inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells  ; mir- <dig> may promote cell proliferation   <cit> ; the micrornas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are well known to be involved in apoptosis  <cit> . some of these candidates might also play a role in regulating blastogenesis in colonial ascidians. cell/tissue communication via exosome transport  <cit>  is associated with mir- <dig>  this well-studied micrornas  <cit>  thus might play a role in the homeostasis of ascidian colonies. finally, mir- <dig> is involved neuron development, sensitivity and circadian rhythms . it might be involved in regulating timing of blastogenesis in colonial ascidians.

the present survey of ncrnas in the draft genome of d. vexillum provides a first resource for studying mirna based regulation and its adaptation. it like will be useful to better understand the developmental and environmental adaptations of this interesting invasive species. the catalog of extensive curated ncrnas of d. vexillum is furthermore an valuable resource for the annotation of the tunicate genomes that are currently being sequenced or for which a systematic ncrna annotation is still missing.
