BACKGROUND
myogenesis is a complex process which leads muscle progenitor cells to proliferate and then differentiate into myotubes. this process is strongly controlled by the spatio-temporal expression of myogenic regulatory factors  - myod, myf <dig>  myogenin and mrf <dig>   <cit>  - and by several transcription factors of the myocyte enhancer factor- <dig>  family  <cit> . their expression defines different stages in the myogenic process: myoblast proliferation, cell-cycle withdrawal, cell fusion to form myotubes, and the maturation of myotubes into myofibers. mrfs are members of the bhlh  protein family  <cit> . they cooperate with mef <dig> transcription factors to mediate the transcription of muscle-specific genes  <cit> . bhlh proteins also form heterodimers with e proteins  <cit> , enabling binding to the e-box consensus dna sequence  <cit>  and the transcription of specific skeletal muscle genes, such as the myosin heavy chain gene  <cit> .

as well as myogenic factors, myogenesis involves other molecular actors such as embryonic fibroblast growth factor , cadherins, members of the cadherin-associated immunoglobulin superfamily such as cdo -related/down-regulated by oncogenes), boc   <cit> , neogenin  <cit>  and p <dig> map kinase  <cit> . these are the classic molecules involved in cell interactions and signaling. in order to monitor the expression of these actors, several studies have exploited the development of high-throughput gene expression profiling using microarrays and proteomic approaches. recent microarray studies on c2c <dig> cells, mouse myoblasts that can differentiate into myotubes, have afforded a broad molecular description of myogenesis and identified sets of genes that display transcriptional variations in expression between proliferating and differentiating cells  <cit> . these studies identified some genes, as zfp- <dig> and ptger <dig>  which were not previously associated with skeletal myogenic differentiation. some proteomics studies on developing myotubes have partially confirmed and completed these microarray-based studies by providing evidence for the involvement of transcription regulators, signaling factors, phospho-proteins and adhesion molecules, as well as novel non-characterized proteins  in skeletal muscle development and contractility  <cit> .

the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix  of myoblasts, like those of other eukaryotic cells, are rich in glycoproteins and glycolipids. despite all the data generated by transcriptomic and proteomic studies, little information is available on the role of glycoconjugates in myogenesis. the principal reason for this lies in the weak expression of glycogenes which is hardly detectable using pan-genomic microarrays. nevertheless, some proteoglycans of the ecm, e.g. syndecans, have been shown to play different roles in myogenesis  <cit> . inhibition of their synthesis halts myoblast proliferation and fusion independently of the expression of the myogenic bhlh factor. in the same way, blocking n-glycan synthesis impairs myoblast fusion  <cit>  and the in vivo invalidation of mgat <dig>  a gene involved in the synthesis of complex n-glycans, generates mouse embryo death in utero  <cit> . conversely, ncam <dig> o-glycosylation promotes myoblast fusion  <cit> . glycolipids also play key roles in cell differentiation  <cit> . they appear to be involved in muscle development, since their membrane levels are altered during g <dig> and g <dig> myoblast fusion, with an increase in gangliosides and neutral glycolipid synthesis  <cit> . in other myogenic cell lines, changes have been observed in the activities of the glycosyltransferases that contribute to glycolipid synthesis  <cit> .

in order to clarify the potential roles of glycosylation in myogenesis, quantitative real-time rt-pcr was used to analyze the expression of  <dig> glycogenes  in differentiating mouse c2c <dig> cells. seventy-four percent of the genes  were expressed during c2c <dig> cell differentiation:  <dig> of them were invariant while  <dig> displayed up- or down-regulations of more than 4-fold. these genes were clustered in three main groups. the first cluster contained genes with gradually decreasing quantities of transcripts. in the second set of genes, transcript levels reached a maximum at 24- <dig> h of differentiation and then decreased, while those in the third cluster increased throughout differentiation. the functions controlled by the clustered genes, as a function of their group, highlighted how the myoblast cell membrane and ecm could be modified for cell fusion during c2c <dig> differentiation. for the first time, this study provides a general framework for glycogene expression during the onset of in vitro myogenesis.

RESULTS
the combined use of cell lines and microarrays offers a major opportunity to study gene expression patterns and/or dynamics during different physiological and pathological processes. however, the substantial findings generated by the use of pangenomic microarrays have generally been difficult to interpret in terms of the gene regulation controlling biological functions. in this study, we chose to explore the expression dynamics of just one part of the mouse genome, called the 'glycogenome', in the context of myogenesis. for this purpose, we first of all standardized the experimental conditions for the differentiation of c2c <dig> , and analyzed the expression of myogenic markers by quantitative real-time rt-pcr. the expression of  <dig> glycogenes was then monitored in differentiating c2c <dig> cells using quantitative real-time rt-pcr with tlda . highly deregulated genes were next clustered as a function of their expression profiles. their functions were analyzed and used to suggest new roles for glycoconjugates in myogenic differentiation.

the expression of mrf and marker genes is consistent with c2c <dig> cell differentiation
when cultured in vitro, c2c <dig> myoblasts start to differentiate following serum deprivation. the first myotubes appeared  <dig> hours after serum starvation and a maximum of mature multinucleated cells was obtained after  <dig> days in the differentiation medium . expression levels of the four mrfs  and four marker genes  known for their involvement in myogenic differentiation  <cit> , were determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr at different time points following the induction of c2c <dig> differentiation.

myod, myf <dig> and myogenin genes were expressed throughout c2c <dig> differentiation . myod mrna levels only changed slightly, regardless of the time elapsing after the start of differentiation. beyond t =  <dig> h, the expression of myf <dig> decreased more than two-fold and remained down-regulated, while the myogenin gene was up-regulated . for mrf <dig>  transcripts were only detected at t =  <dig> h. therefore, the expression profiles of myogenic regulatory factors during c2c <dig> differentiation were in agreement with their expression patterns  described in the literature  <cit> .

expression of the muscle transcription factors mef2a and mef2d increased as from  <dig> h of differentiation to reach 60-fold for mef2a and  <dig> -fold for mef2d at the end of the experiment . their expression was in line with their myogenic activator roles  <cit> . interestingly, the increase in hes <dig> expression started at t =  <dig> h of differentiation and reached  <dig> -fold after  <dig> h. as demonstrated elsewhere  <cit> , this last result argued in favor of hes <dig> involvement at the onset of c2c <dig> differentiation and more generally of the myogenic process. unlike the hes and mef genes, csrp <dig> expression was first detected at t =  <dig> h of differentiation and increased to reach a peak at t =  <dig> h . the expression profile of csrp <dig>  encoding the lim protein, correlated with its activator function of c2c <dig> differentiation. indeed, it has been showed that lim protein is not necessary for myoblast proliferation but plays a key role in upcoming myogenic differentiation  <cit> . thus, the transcriptional expression profiles of both myogenic marker genes and mrfs genes attested to the accurate time course of c2c <dig> differentiation.

most glycogenes are expressed during the onset of c2c <dig> differentiation
the glycogenome refers to all genes involved in glycosylation. it includes ~ <dig> genes and accounts for ~ <dig> percent of the mouse genome. the expression of  <dig> glycogenes was analyzed during the first  <dig> h of c2c <dig> differentiation, when the first myotubes are formed. these  <dig> glycogenes account for more than 60% of the mouse genes known to be related to glycosylation . the proteins encoded by these genes belong to glycosyltranferases, glycosidases, lectins, sulfotranferases or proteins involved in sugar metabolism or transport . given the known weak expression of most glycogenes, their expression patterns were determined by quantitative real-time rt-pcr using the tlda technology which allows the simultaneous analysis of  <dig> selected genes .

1the number of known genes was determined in the mgi database  <cit>  according to their functions.

2the number of analyzed genes, except for the sulfotransferase family, corresponded to assays available from the manufacturer. for sulfotransferase genes,  <dig> probes were chosen from the  <dig> available. values in brackets indicate percentages of analyzed genes compared to known genes.

3number of expressed genes corresponded to significantly expressed genes for at least one kinetic point according to their mrna quantification by qrt-pcr . values in brackets indicate percentages of expressed genes compared to analyzed genes.

4up- and down-regulations correspond to variations in transcript quantity with a minimum factor of  <dig> or  <dig>  values in brackets correspond to percentages of deregulated genes compared to expressed genes.

three-quarters of the genes analyzed were expressed :  <dig> genes displayed significant quantities of transcripts  during at least one point of the differentiation time course. among the  <dig> glycogenes of this study,  <dig> genes were also analyzed in tomczak et al. study  <cit> . the microarray and tlda approaches gave similar results for  <dig> genes,  <dig> were expressed and  <dig> unexpressed. for the remaining common genes , only tlda revealed significant expression levels. this could be explained by the methodologies employed, insofar as microarray techniques are less precise and sensitive than quantitative real-time rt-pcr  <cit> .

among the genes expressed, 34% had a minimum 2-fold modification of their expression for at least one kinetic time, and 10% displayed a variation of at least 4-fold . the significant number of glycogenes thus regulated underlined the critical function of glycosylation in this differentiation process. lectin genes appeared to be regulated preferentially, because only 57% of them were expressed, compared to 73% or more for the other gene families. within each glycogene family, it is interesting to note that no correlation was observed between the number of genes analyzed and the number of those regulated. indeed, glycosyltransferase genes accounted for about 40% of analyzed genes and only 11% of them displayed an mrna variation of more than 4-fold. at the same time, ~50% of lectin and sulfotransferase genes, representing ~27% and ~6% of analyzed genes respectively, were significantly modified in terms of their expression. in addition, no glycogene sub-family, such as fucosyltransferases or sialyltransferases, was preferentially repressed or expressed.

genes displaying more than 4-fold variation  were distributed into four groups according to their glyco-family . the first group included lectin and sulfotransferase genes , the second contained glycosyltransferase and sugar carrier genes , the third included glycosidase genes , and the final group comprised translocase and sugar metabolism genes in which no gene displayed a variation in mrna expression. thus, a large proportion of the modifications to glycogene expression that occurred during c2c <dig> differentiation mainly seemed to affect proteins giving rise to the glycans or lectins required for cell contacts. these results are consistent with the cellular events involved in myotube formation, i.e. cell interactions and fusions.

among the genes analyzed,  <dig> were poorly or not expressed. their corresponding mrna were not detected  or not significantly quantified . these genes encoded proteins involved in physiological processes unrelated to myogenesis. for example, has <dig> encodes a hyaluronan synthase which is active in hyaluronan/hyaluronic acid synthesis and known to be involved in the inflammatory response  <cit> , and icam <dig> encodes a lectin which mediates adhesive interactions during the immune response.

nearly half of analyzed glycogenes could be cell homeostasis genes
among the  <dig> genes expressed,  <dig> were invariantly transcribed . these constitutively expressed genes could be divided into three sets, according to their functions. the first set corresponded to genes involved in cell homeostasis, the second to genes involved in myogenic cell homeostasis and the third to myogenic genes that could probably undergo a late modification to their expression. in this respect, most of the genes encoding proteins involved in n-glycan precursor synthesis and present on our mouse glycogenome tlda were homeostasis cell genes and were constitutively expressed. alg <dig>  alg <dig>  alg <dig>  alg <dig>  and alg <dig> , which are responsible for n-glycan precursor synthesis, were expressed without any significant variations. this was also the case for dpia <dig> , an er chaperone-encoding gene involved in disulfide bond formation  <cit> . the second set of genes, although constitutively expressed during the first  <dig> h of differentiation, could have crucial functions at all stages of myogenesis. the myogenic factor myod, or the sialidase gene neu <dig> are representative of this group  <cit> . finally, the expression of the third set of genes may be modified after  <dig> h of differentiation and be required for later stages of myogenesis. for example, the expression of pomt <dig>  encoding an o-mannosyltransferase which is known to glycosylate the muscle membrane protein α-dystroglycan linking cytoskeleton actin to ecm components, could be tardily up-regulated  <cit> .

glycogenes with significant mrna variations are sequentially expressed
on the  <dig> regulated genes,  <dig> whose expression levels were modified more than 4-fold were retained for further analyses. in order to obtain a global vision of their expression profiles, principal component analysis  was performed. its efficiency was excellent since ~89% of information in the data set was recovered on the first ordinate . the localization of each gene in the figure indicates its expression as a function of differentiation times , compared with the precursor state at t =  <dig> h of differentiation . the position of a gene in the same direction as a vector indicates an increase of expression. by contrast, the position of a gene in the opposite direction to a vector means that the gene was down-regulated. because of their reduced sizes,  <dig> h and  <dig> h vectors were only weakly informative.

gene clustering was performed using the euclidean distances calculated with their coordinates on the first plan of pca. this clearly highlighted three groups . the first contained  <dig> genes, the second four and the third  <dig>  the myogenic marker myf <dig> was classified in cluster  <dig>  myod and myogenin in cluster  <dig> ; mrf <dig> was not clustered since it was not expressed during the first  <dig> h of differentiation. mrna levels in the cluster  <dig> displayed a general tendency to decrease that was more pronounced towards the end of the time course . cluster  <dig> included genes with a peak mrna expression at  <dig> h of differentiation. genes in cluster  <dig> had expression profiles opposite to those of cluster  <dig> because these expressions increased and became more important at the end of the time course .

the  <dig> highly regulated glycogenes were examined according to the activity/function of the enzymes they encode. only their functions linked to myogenesis were considered . functions unknown or unrelated to myogenesis, such as intracellular transport, were grouped in "other function". in the light of the literature, several functions could be assured by one protein. genes in cluster  <dig> encoded proteins mainly involved in cell adhesion and interaction, gag biosynthesis and signal transduction. the down-regulation of most of them could be required for the early mechanisms of myogenesis, especially for the switch from a proliferative to a quiescent state and then to a differentiated state. the four genes in cluster  <dig> were mainly involved in glycosphingolipid and gag biosynthesis . these functions suggest early rearrangements of the plasma membrane and ecm, leading to the first fusion events. among the up-regulated genes in cluster  <dig>  some genes were also involved in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis while the others encoded proteins that were mostly implicated in cell adhesion and interaction and in intracellular biological functions. these functions were consistent with the fusion events leading to myotube formation and maturation beyond  <dig> h of serum deprivation.

with regards the sequential expression of ≥ 4-fold variant glycogenes and the function of encoded proteins, the early differentiation of c2c <dig> cells seemed mainly to require:  the specific expression of molecules involved in cell signaling and a modification to ecm composition,  the expression of cams, and  qualitative and/or quantitative modifications to plasma membrane glycoconjugates.

cell signaling and gags sulfation contribute to the initiation of myogenesis
the functions assured by some down-regulated genes in cluster  <dig> suggested an involvement of cell signaling in myogenic differentiation. the commitment of c2c <dig> cells to the myogenic or adipogenic lineage is controlled by specific transcription factors. myogenesis is regulated by mrfs  <cit> , while adipogenesis is controlled by ppar-γ and the c/ebp families of transcription factors  <cit> . the olr <dig> gene encodes a lectin which is activated by ppar-γ signaling  <cit> . the down-regulation of olr <dig> is consistent with the commitment of c2c <dig> to myogenic differentiation. lfng is an enzyme that elongates o-fucose on some egf-like domains of the notch receptor. it belongs to the fringe family  <cit>  and acts as a modulator of the notch signaling pathway  <cit> . it also influences cell fate during embryonic development  <cit> . given the involvement of notch in the myogenic process  <cit> , lfng down-regulation in differentiating c2c <dig> cells argues for the involvement of lfng in myogenic differentiation. interestingly, among the up-regulated genes in cluster  <dig>  lgals <dig> encoded the galectin- <dig> which is required for adipogenic signaling and adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . this gene is indeed weakly expressed at early stages, but its important transcriptional induction beyond  <dig> h of differentiation suggests, for the first time, its later implication in myogenesis.

gags are known to have many biological functions, including cell adhesion, migration and signaling  <cit> . three sulfotransferase genes from cluster  <dig>  are known for gag sulfation. chst <dig> and chst <dig> are involved in the sulfation of keratan gag and hs3st3b <dig> in that of heparan gag. because hst3st3b <dig> is the only gene in cluster  <dig> which was up-regulated at an early stage , heparan gag could become preferentially sulfated. moreover, the extl <dig> gene in cluster  <dig> encoded a glycosyltransferase that contributes to heparan/heparin sulfate biosynthesis. thus when c2c <dig> cells differentiate, they seem to undergo a switch from the sulfation of keratan gag to the predominant sulfation of heparan gags. such a modification has not previously been reported in myogenesis and it could contribute to the activation of myogenesis. keratan sulfate gag may have anti-adhesive properties  <cit>  that are obviously incompatible with up-coming myoblast fusion events during myogenic differentiation.

only genes whose expression levels are modified more than 4-fold  for at least one time course point are presented. their symbols, functions, pca clusters and relative quantities of mrna at each kinetic time point are given.

cams, glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins of the c2c <dig> plasma membrane appeared to be reshaped for cell fusion
myoblast fusion into myotubes requires cell interactions. ten highly regulated glycogenes are involved in cell adhesion . among the genes in cluster  <dig>  four encoded lectins  and one a sulfotransferase . these five genes have been described in different developmental processes. for example, itgα <dig> associated with itgβ <dig> have been shown to mediate the migration of endothelial cells and angiogenesis  <cit> . in the present case, the down-regulation of itgα <dig> may have been linked to the arrest of myoblast migration and proliferation. in addition, five lectin genes encoding for three integrins , one galectin  and ncam <dig>  belonged to up-regulated genes . most of them have important functions in myogenesis: ncam <dig> in myoblast fusion  <cit> , melusin  in the maturation and/or organization of muscle cells  <cit> , and itgα <dig>  in myogenesis  <cit> . up-regulation of these cam-encoding genes, combined with the down-regulation of the four genes in cluster  <dig> mentioned above, also suggests a potential switch of cam during myogenic differentiation.

cell fusion obviously requires a modification to the quality and quantity of glycans in plasma membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins. three genes in cluster  <dig>  encoded glycosyltransferases implicated in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis . β3galt <dig> is responsible for synthesizing the precursor of lactoseries glycolipids. fut <dig> and sec <dig> are involved in the terminal fucosylation of lacto and/or neo-lactoseries glycolipids. four other genes involved in these different biosyntheses were found in cluster  <dig> . they encoded two other fucosyltransferases, a sialyltransferase and a galactosyltransferase. the sialyltransferase is involved in ganglioside synthesis, while the three other enzymes are required for lacto and/or neo-lactoseries glycolipid biosynthesis. for glycoproteins, three genes in cluster  <dig> were revealed: galnt <dig> and galnt <dig> encoded o-glycan synthesis proteins and st8sia <dig> a sialyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of ncam <dig> polysialic acid . the latter bears polysialylated n-glycans and mucin type o-glycans on a muscle-specific domain which is involved in myoblast fusion  <cit> . the up-regulation of these three genes was in good agreement with the findings of the previous study. therefore, myoblast fusion may require some glycosphingolipid rearrangements and/or terminal modifications  to glycans of membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids.

gm <dig> ganglioside levels increase in differentiating c2c <dig> cells
in order to confirm some of these membrane glycoconjugate rearrangements, glycolipids were considered for further analyses. according to their metabolic pathways and gene expression patterns, lactosylceramid seemed to be preferentially synthesized when compared to galactosylceramid . indeed, the ugt <dig> gene was weakly expressed , while the ugcg and β4galt <dig> genes were strongly expressed . lactosylceramid is the common precursor of four biosynthesis pathways. the expression levels of the analyzed genes implicated in these pathways indicated that some compounds could be preferentially synthesized and/or reshaped. among these, only gm <dig>  could be enhanced because the st3gal <dig>  β3galt <dig> and st8sia <dig> genes were up-regulated . in order to test this hypothesis, immuno-cyto-staining was used to analyze gm <dig> gangliosides on differentiating myoblasts . only a few myoblasts are positively stained at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of differentiation. beyond  <dig> h, the immunostaining increased, and most of the cells were stained at  <dig> h and  <dig> h. this result showed that levels of gm <dig> indeed increased in the plasma membrane during the onset of c2c <dig> differentiation. interestingly, beyond 48- <dig> h of differentiation, cells with stronger staining were mostly elongated and underwent differentiation, which argues for a role of gm <dig> in c2c <dig> differentiation and fusion.

CONCLUSIONS
little is known about the importance of glycosylation in myogenesis because of the poor representativeness of glycogenes, i.e. ~2% of the genome, and because the weak expression of most of them is not revealed by microarrays. in order to determine how glycosylation could be involved in this process, we used a quantitative real-time rt-pcr technology to analyze the expression of  <dig> glycogenes representing more than 60% of the mouse glycogenome, during the onset of differentiation of the myogenic c2c <dig> cell line. the glycogenome includes genes encoding for proteins involved in the transport, synthesis and/or recognition of monosaccharide precursors, glycans and glycoconjugates. this study presents for the first time a focused transcriptomic analysis of the glycogenome during myogenic differentiation.

around 75% of the glycogenes thus analyzed was expressed, one third being deregulated by at least 2-fold, showing the importance of glycosylation in this process. among these deregulated genes,  <dig> were modified more than 4-fold. most of these genes  had never been associated with myogenesis before. the functions of these  <dig> glycogenes suggested new roles for glycoconjugates in myogenic differentiation . the initiation of c2c <dig> differentiation may require specific cell signaling mediated by glycans such as ppar, and notch signaling. at the same time, a modification to ecm composition may occur by means of a switch of keratan sulfate gag to heparan sulfate gag, in order to promote cell differentiation. initiation may be followed by the reshaping of membrane glycoconjugates such as cell adhesion molecules, glycolipids and glycoproteins, in order to prepare cells for fusion into myotubes. the lag time in expression between genes encoding cams and genes encoding glycolipid synthesis proteins suggests that cell interactions precede membrane glycolipid rearrangements. finally, initial myotube maturation in late-appearing myofibers involves various intracellular processes dependent on glycosylation. indeed, a variety of cell functions are associated with proteins encoded by some markedly up-regulated genes. some of these sugar carriers  have already been associated with myogenesis  <cit> . other functions, such as glucose transport by glut <dig>  <cit> , exocytosis by tetranectin   <cit> , or the non-lysosomal catabolic pathway by klotho-related protein   <cit>  are suggested by these transcriptional data. thus, this screening of glycogenome expression provides clues to a clearer understanding of certain stages in myogenesis.
