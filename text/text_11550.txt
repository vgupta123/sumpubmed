BACKGROUND
the clinical syndrome of delayed cerebral ischemia after rupture of a cerebral aneurysm includes recurrent bleeding from the aneurysm, angiographic evidence of cerebral arterial constriction, ischemic deterioration and is associated with high morbidity. early surgery or angiographic coiling stops the bleeding but still carries high ischemic morbidity; on the other hand late surgery has lower ischemic morbidity but a higher overall mortality, which makes the choice of treatment difficult. over  <dig> pharmaceutical agents have been used in unsuccessful attempts to reverse the cerebral vascular narrowing that can be seen after subarachnoid hemorrhage   and to improve outcome of the patients  <cit> . current treatment consists of neurocritical care, measures to prevent and minimize secondary brain injury, calcium channel blockers, and hemodynamic management and endovascular therapies. these manoeuvres are however expensive, time-consuming and only partly effective  <cit> . the search continues for agents that will prevent or alleviate the cerebral ischemia after sah.

several theories have appeared to explain the mechanisms responsible for the late cerebral ischemia after sah, e.g. enhanced levels of free radicals  <cit> , central nervous system dysfunction  <cit> , reduced levels of endothelial relaxing factors  <cit> , increased levels of inflammatory mediators  <cit>  and increased amounts of vasoconstrictor substances such as endothelin   <cit>  and 5-hydroxytryptamine   <cit> .

we have recently suggested that many of these mechanisms are inter related and may share a common signal-transduction pathway. sah may cause enhanced expression of endothelin type b receptor , 5-hydroxytryptaimine type 1b receptor  and angiotensin type  <dig>  receptors, and of genes for cytokines and metalloproteinases  <cit> . these genes are transcribed via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases , in particular of the extracellular signal-regulated 1/ <dig>  kinase pathway that acts via specific transcription factors to result in their protein expression  <cit> . we and others have shown that the upstream mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig> can reduce the erk1/ <dig> activity and the infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion  in rat  <cit> . raf is active upstream of mek and acts specifically to regulate the mek/erk1/ <dig> pathway. in experimental studies we have reported that the raf inhibitor sb386023-b effectively blocks perk1/ <dig> expression and attenuates the cerebrovascular receptor upregulation both on functional and molecular levels  <cit> .

here we suggest that administration of the specific and potent raf inhibitor sb386023-b prevents contractile receptor upregulation and the development of late cerebral ischemia. the selective and potent raf inhibitor sb386023-b has been demonstrated to inhibit both c-raf and b-raf at 1- <dig> μm in a variety of cellular assays, without affecting jun n-terminal kinase  or p <dig>  <cit> . we suggest that the late cerebral ischemia and the cerebral blood flow  reduction are the result of upregulation of receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells  that occur via activation of the erk1/ <dig> pathway. we suggest as a hypothesis that sb386023-b, given at  <dig> and  <dig> h after the sah improves the neurology outcome, normalizes regional cbf and cerebrovascular receptor upregulation.

RESULTS
sah model
sah was induced by injecting  <dig> μl blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in the rat. the raf inhibitor sb-386023-b was injected intracisternally in our rat model at  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> hours after the sah.

the total number of rats used in the study was 71;  <dig> in the sham group,  <dig> in the sah + vehicle group,  <dig> in the sah group and  <dig> was used in the sah + treatment with sb386023-b groups. the mortality rate was 8% and the animals died during the follow up, there was no difference in the mortality rate between the groups. the rats did not show any distressed behaviour. they were moving around normally, eating and drinking. all surviving animals were neurologically examined using an established scoring system  <cit>  . all sah + vehicle animals and sah animals treated with sb386023-b after  <dig> h received a score of  <dig>  and the sham animals and sah animals treated with sb386023-b after  <dig> and  <dig> h got a score of  <dig> 

in all operated rats, mean arterial blood pressure , partial pco <dig> , partial po <dig> , hematocrit  values and temperature were within acceptable limits during the operation. no statistical difference was seen in physiological parameters between the groups; sham, sah + vehicle  and sah treated with sb386023-b at the different time points. as a result of injecting the blood the cortical blood flow dropped over both hemispheres to  <dig> ± 5% of resting flow  and the intracranial pressure  increased from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig> mmhg. the laser doppler blood flow and the elevated icp returned to the basal values within one hour of postoperative monitoring. there was no difference between the sah groups.

acute effects of the raf inhibitor sb386023-b on cbf, icp and functional responses
the acute effects of the raf inhibitor sb386023-b on cbf, icp and functional responses was investigated.

there were no immediate changes in the cortical cbf or the icp  when sb386023-b was administrated at  <dig> h or  <dig> h after the sah . in addition, there were no difference in the local cortical blood flow response and icp during the acute phase between the groups sah and sah treated with sb386023-b. this shows that the raf inhibitor sb386023-b has no acute effect on the cortical cbf and icp.

to study if the raf inhibitor has a direct vasomotor effect on cerebral blood vessels, isolated ring segments of the mca were studied in a myograph. the functional data shows that sb386023-b had no effect on the contractility when it was applied in increasing concentrations directly on the isolated mca . in artery segments precontracted with 5-ht, sb386023-b tended to relax the mca slightly but the effect was not significant at any concentration .

regional cerebral blood flow  to evaluate the overall consequences of sah
the regional and global cbf was investigated by an autoradiographic method in the various groups; sham, sah and sah treated with sb386023-b.

there was a significant global decrease in cerebral blood flow measured at  <dig> h in the sah  group as compared to the control sham group  from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig> ml/ <dig> g/min. treatment with sb386023-b, starting at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after the sah, prevented the reduction in cbf seen after sah  but not at  <dig> h . the sah animals showed a reduction in the regional cbf in  <dig> of the  <dig> brain regions examined compared to the control operated rats . treatment with sb386023-b in conjunction with the sah at  <dig> and after  <dig> h of sah prevented this reduction in rcbf and there was no difference as compared to the control group for any of the regions studied. treatment with sb386023-b administered at  <dig> h after induction of sah did not prevent this reduction in rcbf .

values are expressed in ml/min/ <dig> g and given as mean ± s.e.m. a = significant difference between sah and control groups, b = significant difference between sah and sah treated with sb386023-b  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr post sah.

contractile response to et-1
in the middle cerebral artery  and basilar artery  from sah rats  et- <dig> showed a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve which indicates an enhanced contractile response to et- <dig> as compared to the sham-operated rats  where a sigmoid curve was obtained . treatment with sb386023-b starting at  <dig> and  <dig> h after sah produced a significantly attenuated et- <dig> induced response, compared to the rats with induced sah. interestingly there was no significant difference in the contractile response between sham and sb386023-b given at  <dig> and  <dig> h after sah . when the sb386023-b treatment was begun at  <dig> h after the induced sah the responses did not differ from that seen in animals receiving only sah .

contractile response to 5-ct
5-ct gave rise to a biphasic concentration-dependent contraction, indicating the presence of the two 5-ht receptor subtypes 5-ht1b and 5-ht2a as verified by previous detailed antagonist studies  <cit> . this has been confirmed using gr  <dig>  a selective 5-ht1b receptor antagonist, shifting the high-affinity phase to the right and removing the 5-ht1b component of the low-affinity phase  <cit> .

in both mca and ba from rats with induced sah  5-ct gave rise to an elevated emax, emax and pec <dig> as compared to the sham-operated rats  . in ba treatment in vivo with sb386023-b starting at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after sah showed down regulated responses, both the first 5-ht1b and the second 5-ht2a phases were lower as compared to rats with induced sah . in the mca treatment with sb386023-b at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after the sah showed significantly reduced emax  and tended to a decrease in the emax, pec <dig> and pec <dig> as compared to sah . sb386023-b treatment given  <dig> h after the induced sah did not show attenuated contractile response as compared to sah .

contractile response to ang ii
in mca from rats with induced sah  ang ii  induced a concentration-dependent contraction . treatment with sb386023-b given at  <dig> and  <dig> h after the sah produced a significantly attenuated ang ii induced response, compared to the rats with induced sah. interestingly there was no significant difference in the contractile response between sham and sb386023-b given at  <dig> and  <dig> h after the sah . however, sb386023-b treatment given  <dig> h after the induced sah did not show attenuated contractile response as compared to sah. ang ii did not induce increased contractility in the ba after sah. in the absence of the at <dig> receptor antagonist pd <dig> there was no increased contractile response to ang ii after sah as compared to sham .

quantitative mrna expression
to quantify mrna for the eta, etb, at <dig>  at <dig> and 5-ht1b receptors, rt-pcr and real-time detection monitoring the pcr products was employed.

the standard curves for each primer pair had almost similar slopes, demonstrating that ef- <dig>  eta, etb, 5-ht1b, at <dig> and at <dig> cdna were amplified with the same efficiency . in each pcr experiment, a no template control was included, and there were no signs of contaminating nucleic acids in the samples. since the results from the different brain arteries examined mca, ba and circle of willis  were identical, they were grouped together in the statistical analysis. the results showed that treatment with sb386023-b inhibited the enhanced expression of etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptor mrna levels significantly as compared to control . there was no difference in the expression of eta and at <dig> receptor mrna levels between the three groups sham, sah and sah treated with sb386023-b .

perk1/ <dig> expression examined by western blot
the phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> protein levels was investigated by western blot.

the perk1/ <dig> protein levels were activated after sah  as compared to sham  the treatment with the raf inhibitor sb386023-b at  <dig> h  after sah prevented the perk1/ <dig> protein level activation . however, sb386023-b given  <dig> h after sah did not attenuate the perk1/ <dig> protein levels  .

protein expression examined with immunohistochemistry
the localization and activation of the protein levels was examined by confocal microscopy and immunocytochemistry using selective antibodies towards the phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptors. the results demonstrated that the perk1/ <dig>  etb, 5-ht1b and at <dig> receptors were all present in the cytoplasm of the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. double immunohistochemistry staining versus smooth muscle actin, revealed their co-expression in the smooth muscle cells were performed to verify the localization and in the circle of willis arteries, the mca and the ba, the microvessels in the brain . the etb receptor protein was expressed in the smooth muscle cells and this signal was increased in sah  as compared to sham . similarly the 5-ht1b  and at <dig>  receptor proteins were expressed more in sah as compared to sham  and ; respectively . treatment with the raf inhibitor sb386023-b, starting with administration at  <dig> h or  <dig> h after sah blunted the sah induced upregulation of etb , 5-ht1b  and at <dig>  receptor protein levels in the smooth muscle cells . however, when the sb386023-b treatment was started  <dig> h after the induced sah it did not attenuate the upregulated 5-ht1b  and at <dig>  receptor protein levels in the smooth muscle cell layer as compared to the sah . after sah the perk1/ <dig> level  was increased in the smooth muscle cells as compared to sham . treatment with the erk1/ <dig> inhibitor at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after starting the sah prevented the perk1/ <dig>  activation . sb386023-b given  <dig> h after sah did not attenuate the perk1/ <dig>  .

in addition, as can be seen in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the upregulation was not confined only to the large cerebral arteries but notable also in the brain parenchyma micro vessels but not in the brain tissue proper, in neurons or glial cells. treatment with sb386023-b  reduced also the microvessels receptor expression and the perk1/ <dig> in the smooth muscle cells.

discussion
this study demonstrates that there is a clear association between cerebrovascular receptor upregulation via transcription involving activation of erk1/ <dig> and the subsequent reduction in cbf after sah. specific blockade of the mapk erk1/ <dig> activity with a raf inhibitor abolished the vascular smooth muscle cell perk1/ <dig>  the receptor upregulation and normalised cbf and the neurology score despite administration of the inhibitor as late as at  <dig> h after the start of the sah. if the raf inhibitor was given  <dig> h after initiating the sah there were no significant changes in cbf, neurology score, contractile receptor upregulation and protein levels. there was, however one exception, the protein level for etb and the mrna levels were depressed also when the drug was given  <dig> h after the sah.

a number of mechanisms and receptors have been proposed to account for the late cerebral ischemia that occurs after sah with subsequent high morbidity. here we show that by intracisternal administration of a specific raf inhibitor this response can be modified which implicates that cerebrovascular smooth muscle receptor upregulation is an important part in the response to sah. the immunohistochemistry revealed that sah results in enhanced phosphorylation of perk1/ <dig> in the smooth muscle cells and that this expression is normalized by sb386023-b treatment. this confirms that specific inhibition of the ras/raf/mek/erk1/ <dig> signaling pathway in the cerebrovascular system is associated with the receptor protein expression.

considerable efforts have been spent at the development and testing of drugs that may antagonize putative spasmogens, but to this date no effective drug exists  <cit> . the latest in this line is the et receptor antagonist clazosentan  <cit> ; the first preliminary study revealed an effect on large artery vasospasm but had no effect on the neurology deficit. the clinical trials with the selective eta antagonist clazosentan demonstrated that clazosentan reduces the severity of vasospasm following aneurysmal sah; however, there was no positive effect in the outcome of the patients. this supports our view that the inhibition of only one receptor system will not remedy other receptor systems involved. instead, the mechanism responsible for the receptor upregulation might be a more promising target.

since the etiology of cerebral vasospasm is multifactorial, we hypothesize that several receptors are involved in the development and maintenance of this prolonged pathological contraction  <cit> . our studies have demonstrated involvement of at least three groups of contractile cerebrovascular receptors in experimental sah  <cit>  and in human stroke  <cit> ; this alludes to the possibility of the involvement of several receptor systems in late cerebral ischemia and makes it attractive to search for a key signal-transduction mechanism involved in the upregulation process. we observed that sah results in receptor upregulation not only of the large cerebral arteries but as shown in figure  <dig> also of vascular smooth muscle cell receptors in brain microvessels. this latter observation might be of clinical relevance since the clazosentan study  and the early nimodipine study  <cit>  revealed partial reversal of angiographic vasospasm but no or minor effect on clinical outcome.

targeting only one of several important subtypes of receptors such as those of endothelin- <dig>  serotonin or angiotensin ii separately in clinical or experimental trials might prevent cerebral ischemia to a certain degree as seen in the literature, but treatments aimed at a common signaling pathway would be more beneficial since further possible receptors and inflammatory mechanisms might be involved. in addition, the different receptor antagonists have profound systemic vascular effects which make their specific effects on the cerebral circulation difficult to obtain. we have demonstrated that upregulation of several of the contractile receptors in the cerebral vasculature are interconnected by their signal transduction pathways  <cit> . hence, blocking common signal transduction pathways can simultaneously affect the signaling for production of these receptor subtypes  <cit> . cerebral ischemia elicits a wide range of responses resulting in activation of a number of intracellular pathways. in particular there is an involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinases  signalling pathway in cerebral vasospasm  <cit> .

the mapk is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation and survival  <cit> . interestingly it is only the erk1/ <dig> pathway and not those of p <dig> or jnk that is active during the first  <dig> h after experimental sah  <cit> . jnk and p <dig> are only activated at  <dig> h and this may relate to inflammation and apoptosis which occur later in the process. in addition, sb386023-b is selective for the erk1/ <dig> pathway since it did not inhibit the jnk and p- <dig> mapk pathways  <cit> . several other studies have evaluated the effect of available raf inhibitors on cerebrovascular g-protein coupled receptors  <cit> . in additional the jnk, p <dig> and pkc inhibitors have been tested. however the erk1/ <dig> seems to be more important for the receptor upregulation  <cit> . the raf inhibitor sb386023-b was the one showing the best inhibiting effect on the cerebrovascular receptors and the most specific for the mapk pathway, which is the reason why this inhibitor was chosen. in the present study we have performed a study closely related to the clinical reality. thus, sb386023-b was found to have no acute effect on the cbf, icp or on the tone of the mca or on its contractility.

it is notable that the effect of the raf inhibitor was equally strong when administration was started  <dig> h after the sah as when given at the time of the sah , but had no significant effect when it was given  <dig> h after the sah. the present study was designed to examine the possibility of a therapeutic window of relevance to the clinic. interestingly, we observed that the upregulation of receptors are located to the cerebral blood vessels smc , with no signs of upregulation of either receptors or activation of perk1/ <dig> in the adjacent brain tissue. this is important since only a fraction of the sah patients have angiographic vasospasm  <cit> . in addition, we observed that both the large cerebral arteries belonging to the circle of willis and the cerebral micro vessels in the brain parenchyma are involved to the same extent in cerebral ischemia after sah. the raf inhibitor sb386023-b affects all vessel types. one possibility may be that the micro vessels are involved in the ischemia that occurs without angiographic vasospasm and the larger arteries might be involved in ischemia where vasospasm takes place or can be visualized angiographically.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have provided two important observations: first blockade of perk1/ <dig> with a raf inhibitor in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells prevents the upregulation of contractile receptors and the associated reduction in the regional cbf and neurology score after sah. second the two phenomena are associated and putatively treatable also in the clinical setting since administration of the raf inhibitor first applied  <dig> h after the induction of the sah showed to have effect. therefore, we suggest that this is a novel target for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral ischemia after sah.
