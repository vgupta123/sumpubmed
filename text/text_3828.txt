BACKGROUND
in mammals, long-chain acyl-coa synthetases  are necessary for fatty acid degradation, phospholipid remodeling, and the production of long acyl-coa esters that regulate many physiological processes  <cit> . these membrane-bound enzymes act on non-polar hydrophobic substrates, fatty acids, generating acyl-coas, important activated intermediates in lipid synthesis pathways, that are water-soluble as well as powerful detergents  <cit> . in the first step of the two-step reaction catalyzed by these enzymes, an acyl-amp intermediate is formed from atp. amp is then exchanged with co-enzyme a to produce the activated acyl-coa. the five long-chain acyl-coa synthetase genes can give rise to multiple spliced transcript variants  <cit> . the structure of these membrane proteins has not been solved for the mammalian acsls but homology to a bacterial form, whose structure has been determined, points at specific structural features that are important for these enzymes across species  <cit> . in particular, the bacterial form acts as a dimer, and a conserved short motif, called the fatty acid gate domain, is implicated in controlling access of the fatty acid substrate to the catalytic site of each of the two sub-units  <cit> .

these membrane proteins can not be purified in the absence of detergent and can form aggregates when over-expressed in e. coli  <cit> . defining the enzymatic characteristics of the mammalian forms in vivo as well as in vitro has proven a challenge and has resulted in rather contradictory results  <cit> . isoforms of the human acsl <dig> members, predominately found in brain tissue and erythrocytes, can be expressed as active enzymes in the membrane of e. coli  <cit> . we determined the activity of several isoforms representing alternative spliced variants which differ at their amino-terminus and have different short motifs of  <dig> residues in close proximity of the atp-binding site  <cit> . these alternative motifs, specific for the mammalian forms, were predicted to contain different versions of the bacterial homologue fatty acid gate-domain  <cit> . we now show that alternative splicing of these motifs generates isoforms of acsl <dig> with strikingly different activity, and we identified the aromatic residues representing the gating residue for fatty acid entry for each version of the gate-domains of human acsl <dig> 

RESULTS
activity of the tyrosine-gate, phenylalanine-gate and no-gate domain isoforms
on the basis of sequence similarity with the tryptophan-containing gate-domain of the bacterial form, we have proposed that human acsl <dig> isoform  <dig> contains a tyrosine-containing gate-domain , whereas isoform  <dig> contains a phenylalanine-containing gate-domain   <cit> . for isoform  <dig>  the two alternative spliced exons are skipped and this enzyme lacks a gate-domain  . isoform  <dig> also represents alternative usage of a splicing site affecting the n-terminus resulting in a short truncation . these three isoforms and several recombinant mutant forms were produced in e. coli. although a significant amount of the expressed proteins accumulated in inclusion bodies, mammalian acsl forms can be expressed in their active form in the plasma membrane of e. coli  <cit> . under the growth conditions used to produce the recombinant forms, the bacterial acsl form, fadd  <cit> , is expressed at a very low level  <cit> . this presents a unique advantage of the bacterial expression system in contrast to the expression of these isoforms in eukaryotic cells. in those cells, the endogenous acsl enzymes would interfere with measurement of the activity of the recombinant acsl <dig> forms. all forms and mutants used in this study are presented in figure  <dig>  few differences in expression level of the isoforms and constructs were observed in the different membrane fractions obtained from e. coli .

the three versions of the human protein, y-gate , f-gate  and no-gate , have remarkable different activities . in presence of oleic acid , formation of oleoyl-coa  by the f-gate enzyme was about  <dig> times higher than that of the y-gate enzyme  . the activity of isoform  <dig>  which has no gate-domain and a short internal deletion at its n-terminus, was so low that it could not reliably be distinguished from the activity values obtained from control membrane fraction isolated from cells that did not express the human enzyme  . in addition, a recombinant full-length version of an enzyme without a gate-domain, construct Δgate, displayed no detectable activity . reactions performed with other fatty acid substrates, palmitic acid  and arachidonic acid , did not result in formation of acyl-coa products by these two inactive forms and acyl-amps intermediate species were also not detected . these results established that the fatty acid gate-domain is essential for the activity of the human acsl forms.

identification of the gating residues
in the bacterial acsl protein, the aromatic tryptophan residue blocks entry of the fatty acid in the absence of atp. upon atp binding to the nearby p-loop, a conformational change induces rotation of the protruding side-chain ring of tryptophan away from the center of the fatty acid channel allowing entry of the fatty acid substrate  <cit> . this tryptophan gating residue, part of the fatty acid gate-domain, is not conserved in mammalian acsl. the two others aromatic residues at position  <dig>  tyrosine or phenylalanine, were predicted to represent the gating residues of the two alternative versions of the human acsl <dig> gate-domain of isoform  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . by site-directed mutagenesis, the tyrosine residue of isoform  <dig> was replaced by phenylanine , tryptophan  or alanine . similarly, the phenylalanine residue of isoform  <dig> was changed to a tyrosine , tryptophan  or alanine . because the activity of the y-gate isoform was very low, these tests were also performed with the more active version obtained by removal of the first  <dig> residues, Δn- construct . data obtained with this truncated form are presented. substitution of the aromatic residues, tyrosine and phenylalanine, to an alanine  produced forms with very low activity . this effect was independent of the fatty acid chain length  and relative saturation or unsaturation  . additional evidence of the essential function of these two aromatic residues was obtained by their substitution by the two other aromatic residues: y residue of isoform  <dig>  replaced by f or w, and f residue of isoform  <dig> replaced by y or w. for the Δn- protein, substitution of the tyrosine by a phenylalanine  or tryptophan  greatly decreased the activity rate of these mutants . however, in the context of a f-gate domain, all three aromatic residues  resulted in enzymes with high activity rates .

these results indicate that the splicing event affecting the two alternative fatty acid gate-domains of the human and rodent acsl <dig> forms produces enzyme species with different gating residues and enzymatic properties. in addition, these results establish that, for a y-gate enzyme, the presence of a tyrosine residue at position  <dig> was essential for activity, whereas any aromatic residue could be tolerated in the f-gate domain. finally, the difference of activity of the y-to-f mutant compared to a normal f-gate enzyme, and of a f-to-y mutant compared a normal y-gate enzyme indicate that other residues are involved in defining the specific activity of isoform  <dig> and  <dig> 

specific gate-domain residues essential for activity
among the  <dig> residues constituting the two alternative spliced gate-domains, the gating residue and  <dig> additional residues are different. thus, a mutant form with a y to f change still contains  <dig> residues present in the y-gate form that are absent in the normal f-gate form. in the absence of sufficient structural knowledge on these domains, we compared the amino acid sequence of the mammalian, plants and bacterial forms  <cit>  and sought residues only found, or never found, in combination with either the tyrosine or the phenylalanine  <dig>  using this approach  <cit> , we identified a histidine/leucine residue pair at position  <dig> that seemed associated with the tyrosine/phenylalanine pair at  <dig> . as presented below, whenever a histidine was present at position  <dig>  enzymes with a tyrosine at position  <dig> were active, whereas the presence of a histidine was sufficient to inactivate a form with a phenylalanine. histidine  <dig> is present in the y-gate isoform of acsl <dig> and acsl <dig> . histidine  <dig> is replaced by a leucine in the f-gate version  of both acsl <dig> and acsl <dig>  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  when a histidine was introduced in place of leucine  <dig> of the f-gate isoform , the mutant form had an activity nearly as low as the Δn- <dig> mutant in the y-gate environment, i.e. hnormal <dig> - fmutant <dig>  6th bar. substituting the phenylalanine of the poorly active mutant, hmutant <dig> - fnormal <dig> , to a tyrosine, generated the double mutant enzyme hmutant <dig> - ymutant <dig> in the context of a f-gate motif  resembling a normal y-gate domain , fully restored activity. hence, a histidine residue at position  <dig> cannot be present when a phenylalanine residue is also present at position  <dig> . however, a gate-motif with a tyrosine  can accommodate both a leucine and a histidine . whereas enzymes with a f-gate domain can accommodate a tyrosine in place of the phenylalanine regardless of the residue present at position  <dig> , enzymes with a y-gate motif were only active when a tyrosine was present at position  <dig> . these results are a strong indication that other essential residue may be necessary to permit correct folding and/or function of this domain of the enzyme. in addition to the histidine/leucine pair at position  <dig>  other residues, not necessarily specific to a gate motif nor necessarily present in the gate-domain, are involved in defining the specific activity of the isoforms.

atp requirement and inhibition of activity
as indicated above, isoform  <dig> carrying an f-gate domain was more active than the y-gate isoform. the two rat forms acsl6_v <dig>  and acsl6_v <dig>   were also reported to have a different activity toward oleic acid  <cit> . the rat y-gate form had a lower activity than the f-gate form, confirming the results obtained with the human forms, but they also appeared to have a significant difference of affinity for atp. rat acsl6_v <dig>  was reported to have a remarkable poor affinity for atp, km =  <dig>   <dig> μm  <cit> , as compared to an already low affinity  for the f-gate form  <cit> . in our system, the human forms did not show such high atp requirements. activity rates did not differ significantly at atp concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm . figure  <dig> shows activity rate values obtained with the different atp concentrations relative to value obtained with  <dig> mm atp. higher concentrations of atp resulted in a small increase of activity for the form with a low activity  but these concentrations were strongly inhibitory for the more active f-gate form and the two very active n-terminus truncated forms . given that inhibition at high atp concentration was seen with forms carrying the two versions of the gate-domain , it seems unlikely that the lack of inhibition of the lesser active form, y-gate, represents a significant enzymatic difference toward atp of the two versions of the gate-domain, as previously suggested for the rat acsl <dig> isoforms  <cit> .

atp is needed for the initial formation of the acyl-amp intermediate in the two-step reaction catalyzed by acsl. coa-sh is subsequently exchanged to form the final acyl-coa product. to determine if excess atp could inhibit the coa-exchange reaction and limit the formation of the product by the active enzymes, all 14c-labeled compounds present in the reaction mixture were separated, identified and quantified by thin-layer chromatography . the distribution of the 14c-labeled compounds was similar at  <dig> and  <dig> mm atp. under these conditions, 70-80% of the substrate was converted and the relative ratio of the two acyl-amp and acyl-coa species was similar, despite a 20-fold difference in atp concentration . however, for reactions performed at  <dig> mm atp, the acyl-amp and acyl-coa species were not formed, and most of the 14c-label was found in the unreacted acyl substrate , as was the case for the reaction performed without addition of atp . hence, the inhibitory effect of atp was also observed on the formation of the intermediary acyl-amp species and accounted for the decrease in production of the final acyl-coa product. as this effect was not observed with an enzyme lacking strong activity, these results may indicate that the released pyrophosphate at the first-step and/or the released amp during the second step can inhibit the acyl-amp reaction. the reported higher km value for the lesser active rat acsl <dig> isoform  <dig> may have been erroneously determined because of the lack of inhibition and of the slightly increased activity obtained at high atp concentration, as observed with human isoform  <dig> 

inhibition of acyl-coa formation by triton x-100
the detergent triton x- <dig> has been used to solubilize rodent acsls from microsomal membranes at concentrations of  <dig> mm or above. these values far exceed the critical micellar concentration  and are therefore expected to produce an assay mixture containing a significant amount of mixed micellar structures. it was reported that the activity of different rodent acsl forms were either inhibited   <cit> , stimulated   <cit> , or unaffected   <cit>  by triton x- <dig> at concentrations above the cmc value. in our assay system, acsl <dig> proteins were not solubilized from the membrane and only a low amount of triton x- <dig>  was added to solubilize the fatty acid substrate. in contrast to the reported results of the rodent acsl <dig>  which seemed unaffected by this detergent  <cit> , the human acsl <dig> isoforms  were strongly inhibited with an estimated ic <dig> of  <dig> mm . to explore this apparent difference between the human and rodent form, we treated human isoform  <dig> with triton x- <dig> at an inhibitory concentration of  <dig> mm, followed by assaying its activity in the presence of a non-inhibitory concentration of  <dig>  mm. this treatment did not result in decreased activity , indicating that the detergent does not denature the protein, at least not irreversibly, but can decrease the rate of catalysis of the human acsl <dig> enzymes. this concentration dependent inhibitory effect of triton x- <dig> on acsl activity could be the result of micellar structures that are formed above  <dig>  mm. these structures most likely attract the hydrophobic fatty acid substrate and as such, may compete with the enzyme, resulting in decreased availability of the substrate. this effect on acsl <dig> activity by triton x- <dig> suggests that the conclusions for the different acsl forms should be interpreted cautiously and raises concerns for the usage of this detergent.

alteration of the carboxy-terminal domain affects activity
unexpectedly, an acsl <dig> construct with a tag at its c-terminus had a far lower activity than a construct with a tag fused to its n-terminus. as shown on panel a of figure  <dig>  the relative activity rate  was 10-times lower for the c-terminally tagged fusion than for the n-terminally tagged construct. raw activities data are presented in figure  <dig>  panel b. fusion at either the n-terminus or c-terminus failed to improve the activity of isoform  <dig>  supporting previous findings that this enzyme was not active . the reduced activity of human acsl <dig>  and of mouse acsl <dig>  <cit>  suggest that addition of residues to the short c-terminus hammer domain impair its movement and positioning relative to the anvil central domain, and thus, in the formation of the catalytic site  <cit> . in studies of rat acsls, different forms were produced with a flag epitope tag at their c-teminus  <cit> . activities of these recombinant flag-enzymes were not compared to n-terminally tagged proteins and our findings suggest that the kinetic parameters obtained with these recombinants proteins might not represent those of the native forms.

removal of the amino-terminus stimulates activity
in mammalian cells, the various members of the acsl family have been located in membranes of different organelles  <cit> . in the host e. coli, human acsl <dig> forms are also associated with the membrane  <cit> . to define region of the protein responsible for this association, we removed a motif at the n-terminus of the protein which was predicted to constitute a trans-membrane  spanning segment  <cit> . this region partially overlaps the truncation that naturally occurs in the spliced variant isoform  <dig> . despite this deletion, isoform  <dig> was found in the membrane . in e. coli, recombinant isoform  <dig>  and isoform  <dig> truncated of this predicted tm  were also associated with the membrane . the acsl homologue in bacteria, fadd, has been proposed to associate with the membrane through formation of oligomeric complexes partially associated with the lipid bilayer. other hydrophobic region of human acsl <dig> may interact with the bacterial lipids.

the activities of the truncated forms  were assayed with oleic acid  and compared to that of their respective full-length versions  . surprisingly, removal of the n-terminus resulted in enzymes with far greater activity . these differences were most noticeable in the 10-fold increase in velocity value of the otherwise poorly active y-gate form. for the more active f-gate form, removal of the n-terminus resulted in an increase of the apparent affinity rather than in the vmax value. similarly, large increases in activity rates were observed with palmitic acid  and arachidonic acid  . as anticipated, truncation of the n-terminus did not rescue the activity of the inactive form truncated of its gate-domain  .

amino-terminal domain is not essential for oligomer formation
on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the migration pattern of the truncated f-gate form was noticeably different compare to the full-length protein. as reported previously  <cit> , when proteins were solubilized from membranes under mild condition  rather than boiled before separation on gels containing  <dig> % sds, human acsl <dig> isoforms were detected as two bands with apparent molecular mass of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda . the calculated mass of a monomeric form was  <dig> kda , but as commonly observed for hydrophobic proteins, human acsl <dig> migrates faster than the molecular weight standard of the corresponding mass. the species of higher molecular mass was twice the apparent mass of a monomeric protein and since the two bacterial homologues  are dimeric enzymes  <cit> , it likely represents the dimeric form of human acsl <dig>  the same pattern was obtained with rat acsl <dig> isoform  <dig> and isoform  <dig> expressed in e. coli . the two bands  were also recognized by an antibody raised against the epitope tag present at the n-terminus  and by an affinity-purified antibody raised against human acsl <dig>  <cit> . both bands were also detected in protein extracts of mammalian cells expressing acsl <dig>  <cit> . although, these two species were detected with all forms and recombinant constructs, their relative amounts were significantly different for the Δn- truncated construct . as seen on a gel, the ratio of high to low molecular mass species was greater for the truncated Δn- protein than for its full-length version . hence, the n-terminal domain is not essential for formation of the dimeric complexes but its removal increased dimer formation and/or stability in the presence of sds. based on the findings that the bacterial forms act as dimers, these complexes probably represent the active species of human acsl <dig>  their relative increased in abundance could account for the higher activity observed with the truncated f-gate construct . the Δn- protein was also more active than its full-length version, but even under the mild denaturing conditions we used, we could not detect a difference in the dimer to monomer ratio. repeated attempts to resolve and quantify these oligomeric forms under non-denaturing conditions  <cit>  or by gel filtration chromatography were not successful. differences in stability of the two full-length forms  might also account for their unexpected differences of activity .

detection of interaction between isoforms
to confirm the presence of dimeric complexes, we monitored their formation using a two-hybrid interaction detection assay. the  <dig> isoforms and the truncated Δn version of isoform  <dig> were fused to the lambda-ci protein, bait constructs, or fused to the amino-terminal domain of the rna polymerase alpha subunit, target constructs . in all constructs, fusions were made at the n-terminus of the acsl <dig> isoforms and their expression was under the control of an inducible promoter . in this system, growth of e. coli in the presence of a histidine inhibitor  can only be obtained when the two fusion proteins  interact to form a dimeric complex . growth was monitored under different conditions and tests were performed either on solid media or in liquid culture, in the absence or presence of the drug, with cells expressing fusion constructs or lacking the constructs. results of these assays are presented in the additional file  <dig> and those obtained on solid media with isoforms  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the Δn construct cloned in the bait vector in combination with either the empty target vector or with isoform  <dig> cloned in the target vector are shown in figure  <dig>  some combinations of the two vectors with the different isoforms resulted in growth defects even in the absence of the drug . however, none of the constructs with the inactive isoform  <dig> used as target showed a growth defect . the cells co-expressing the same isoform  showed growth , confirming existence of the homodimeric complexes previously detected by electrophoresis . the Δn truncated construct rescued growth with all  <dig> isoforms, providing further evidences that this region is not required for oligomer formation. heterodimeric interactions were also detected with all forms, especially when the inactive isoform  <dig> was used as the target . in addition, interactions of the active isoform  <dig> and  <dig> with the other forms were detected under both solid and liquid culture conditions .

activity of oligomeric complexes
addition of a tag at the c-terminus of the active isoform  <dig> resulted in an enzyme with very low activity. this tagged version of isoform  <dig> provided an additional test to detect the formation of oligomeric complexes. activity assays were performed with membrane fractions obtained from cells carrying a single vector that allowed co-expression of two differently tagged proteins from the same promoter. this provided an assay for the measurement of the activity of different isoforms associated in oligomeric complexes. for example, acsl activity of cells co-expressing each of the two tagged versions of isoform  <dig>  the active nter- <dig> with the inactive cter- <dig>  were compared to cells that co-express the active nter- <dig> with the inactive cter- <dig>  in addition, different combinations were made to generate reference and control cells . to detect the putative effects of the inactive sub-unit  on activity of the enzyme complex , the activity rates were normalized to the amount of active sub-units present in the complexes, i.e. nter- <dig> . when the two different tagged versions of isoform  <dig>  were co-expressed, the rate of formation of acyl-coa by membranes obtained from these cells was far lower than the rate of synthesis obtained with the nter- <dig> enzyme expressed alone . even in the absence of normalization for the relative amount of the active species , activity rate of the nter-2/cter- <dig> enzyme was nearly as low as the value obtained with the cter- <dig> enzyme expressed alone  or with co-expression of the two tagged versions of the inactive isoform  <dig>  . this result strongly suggests that the inactivated isoform  <dig> had a dominant effect on the activity of the active unit, nter-isoform  <dig>  this effect of one protein on the activity of another confirmed that oligomeric complexes were formed as established above. the effect of the inactivated cter-isoform  <dig> on an active form was compared to the effect of the naturally occurring inactive isoform  <dig>  on that active form. this test may mimic the in vivo circumstances in which various spliced isoforms with different activity rates are expressed in the same cells  <cit> . intriguingly, interaction with isoform  <dig> did not result in inhibition of the isoform  <dig>  the species nter-2/cter- <dig>  was as active as the homodimer nter- <dig> .

the c-terminus hammer domain of acsl is connected to the anvil domain, carrying the atp-binding site and the gate-domain, by a flexible linker  <cit> . the hammer and anvil form the catalytic site and the correct positioning of the c-terminus is essential to prevent escape as well as entry of acyl-amp until the second step of the reaction with coa-sh has occurred, and acyl-coa is formed. the defect of the extended c-terminally tagged enzyme could render the second active sub-unit of the dimeric complex structurally defective resulting in a slower acyl-coa synthetase activity. isoform  <dig> lacks the motif carrying the fatty acid gate-domain. this domain is essential for the entry and access of the fatty acid to the catalytic site. the removal of the short region connecting the fatty acid tunnel to the atp-binding site might not preclude processing of fatty acids once they have found their way to the site. the apparent activity of the isoform  <dig> in the complex formed with isoform  <dig> could indicate that entry of the fatty acids through one of the sub-units provides substrate to the other one through an internal channel event. efforts to solve the structure of these homo- and heterodimeric complexes are underway.

CONCLUSIONS
the alternative fatty acid gate-domain motifs play an essential role in the activity of the human acsl <dig> enzymes. the aromatic residues representing the gating residues of the two versions of the gate-domain were identified as a tyrosine for isoform  <dig> and a phenylalanine for isoform  <dig>  a tyrosine and tryptophan could be substituted to the phenylalanine residue of isoform  <dig> without affecting activity whereas the tyrosine residue was essential for the activity of isoform  <dig>  we also identified another residue, a leucine, present in the f-containing gate domain , that is essential for the activity of that form. the three isoforms can form dimeric complexes with identical units and with different isoforms. as previously proposed, the diversity of acyl-coa synthetase activities of the many acsl <dig> enzyme species might represent an adaptation mechanism of an enucleated cell, the red blood cell, to the absolute necessity to repair damaged lipids and to maintain the lipid composition of the membrane  <cit> .

the activation of fatty acids to acyl-coa is required for many fatty acid utilizing pathways in physiology. all plasma membranes need to maintain a defined lipid composition, both in relative amount of the different classes and in molecular species within each class. acylation of lysophospholipids with different acyl-coa species is an essential step, and acsl enzymes play a central role in this process  <cit> . in the red blood cell membrane, acsl <dig> is responsible of maintaining the phospholipid composition of this enucleated cell lacking de novo lipid synthesis. for the iron-containing oxygen-carrying red blood cell, the activities of acsl <dig> isoforms are especially important for the repair of phospholipids damaged by oxidation. acsl <dig> is one of the major forms expressed in neuronal cells, and as in other cells that rapidly turn-over their plasma membrane lipids, activities of the different acsl <dig> complexes might be essential to their plasma membrane plasticity  <cit> . an understanding of how the different isoforms of acsl <dig> act, and interact, is essential to determine the mechanisms sustaining the formation of the various acyl-coa species needed to maintain plasma membrane composition. additional enzymatic studies combined with structural information are needed to better understand the function of these enzymes in physiologic processes.
