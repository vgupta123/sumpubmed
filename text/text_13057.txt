BACKGROUND
analysis of signaling events within individual cells with microscopy imaging has several advantages over non-imaging techniques. the principal advantage of imaging cytometry over plate reader assays and even other single cell techniques such as flow cytometry is the potential for collection of morphological and spatial information over subcellular and supracellular length scales  <cit> . this can be an advantage for cell based assays for drug cytotoxicity screening where even relatively simple morphological measurements, such the area of the nucleus, have been shown to be predictive of clinical outcome  <cit> . imaging cytometry can collect spatial information on several hundreds of adherent cells, as well as provide signal quantification in single adherent cells and quantification of differences between cells in the population. image cytometry has been used to study activation of signaling proteins such as p <dig> map kinase where change in localization of the protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus has been used to score activation  <cit> .

artifacts introduced during sample fixation and immunostaining can compromise the cellular location and amount of proteins of interest. samples for end-point imaging cytometry are typically fixed using a crosslinking or denaturing fixative such as paraformaldehyde, or various solvents such as methanol and ethanol  <cit> . fixation methods for quantitative immunofluorescence labeling may need to be tailored for different targeted proteins  <cit>  in order to stabilize relevant cell structures, to enable epitope exposure and to preserve signal intensity. the measurement of phosphorylated proteins in cells by microscopy presents particular challenges because the phosphorylation states are dynamic and sensitive to cellular phosphatases  <cit> . establishing and validating the appropriate fixation and staining procedures for maintaining amount and location of antigen target is critical for quantitative microscopy applications.

in anchorage dependent cells, myosin-generated contractile forces on the extracellular matrix  underpin several vital cellular processes related to cell adhesion. these include rapid events such as the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions  <cit> , and temporally distal events such as those regulating entry in to s-phase  <cit> . hence, tools to measure myosin activity are of particular interest in cell adhesion and cytoskeleton research. the phosphorylation of myosin on the  <dig> kd regulatory light chain  is mainly responsible for changes in its activity. mlc can be monophosphorylated on ser <dig>  or diphosphorylated on ser19/thr <dig>  there are multiple pathways for the activation of myosin light chain phosphorylation including p <dig> activated kinase , and rho-dependent kinase   <cit>  and drugs that inhibit disregulated contractility are being investigated as potential therapeutics for pulmonary hypertension  <cit> . since the activation of myosin is purported to be critical to a number of important downstream processes including cell migration, proliferation and transformation  <cit> , a reliable microscopy based mlc phosphorylation assay could provide valuable insight into these processes. in this study, we developed and optimized a protocol for using automated fluorescence microscopy to quantify the level of mlc diphosphorylation in adherent cells.

RESULTS
to take advantage of the benefits of microscopy, it was important to preserve the overall morphology of the specimen while also obtaining an optimal signal for myosin light chain phosphorylation. we first used overall cell morphology as the qualitative criteria to screened several fixation techniques. we tested four different fixation reagents: ethanol , methanol , acetone , and paraformaldehyde . pfa best preserved cell morphology while the organic solvents ethanol, methanol, and acetone, gave variable results as fixatives and in some cases caused cells to round up upon addition of any one of the three solvents . pfa was selected as the fixation reagent, and four different permeabilization methods were screened to select the optimal permeabilization strategy. after fixation by pfa at room temperature, cells were permeabilized with methanol , ethanol , acetone  or triton x- <dig> in pbs . we also tested a simultaneous fixation and permeabilization procedure by including  <dig> % triton x- <dig> in the pfa solution . the presence of phospho-mlc antibody staining along well-defined f-actin stress fibers was used as the criterion for evaluating the permeabilization method.

each of the different permeabilization techniques resulted in distinct differences in the staining patterns. meoh permeabilized cells showed long filaments of phospho-mlc staining organized in a manner reminiscent of f-actin stress fibers, but very low intensity f-actin stress fiber staining by alexa 594-phalloidin . etoh permeabilized cells showed an expected pattern of staining typical of both phospho-myosin filaments and f-actin stress fibers but did not produce the same intensity of staining as the pfatx method , while acetone permeabilized cells did not show staining for either phospho-mlc or stress fibers . longer exposure times were required for the alexa 594-phalloidin images for cells permeabilized with meoh , etoh , and ac  than for cells permeabilized with pfa+tx or pfatx . the two tx- <dig> permeabilization methods yielded comparable stress fiber morphology , but pfatx resulted in the best overall staining of stress fibers and phosphorylated mlc , and the greatest fold change in mlc-phosphorylation signal upon inhibition by y <dig> . in each of these fixation conditions where phospho-mlc signal could be observed, treatment of the cells with  <dig> μm y <dig> for  <dig> h before fixation dramatically reduced the signal from phospho-mlc . upon y <dig> treatment, even when most of the mlc phosphorylation signal was inhibited, there still remained well organized parallel strands of f-actin . based on these results, pfatx was found to be optimal among the methods tested to preserve myosin light chain phosphorylation and actin stress fibers.

we quantified myosin light chain phosphorylation intensity in individual cells by employing texas-red maleimide  labeling of each cell as a mask for the entire cell area  <cit> , and applying that mask to the same field examined with appropriate filters for alexa  <dig> immunofluorescence. we found no systematic contribution to the phospho-mlc signal from the tx-red cell mask as discussed in methods. we examined the contribution of non-specific binding of secondary antibody to the measured phospho-mlc signal and found a small constant contribution to the signal in secondary antibody only controls. this background signal was corrected for as described in methods.

using tx-red staining of cells to determine the spread area of individual cells, we examined the relationship between phospho-mlc intensity and cell morphology. we found a correlation between cell area and myosin light chain diphosphorylation  indicating that larger cells tended to contain more activated mlc. when cells were treated with y <dig>  the diphospho-mlc signal was decreased, but the relation between mlc phosphorylation and cell area remained linear  over the full range of cell areas. we also observed no significant change in the mean area or the distribution of cell areas measured across the population in absence or presence of y <dig> . the mean cell areas and their standard deviations from three replicate measurements were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> in the absence of y <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> in the presence of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> μm y <dig> respectively. the coefficient of variation  of cell sizes within the population was also measured for each treatment, in order to assess the range of cell sizes present. the cvs were calculated from the standard deviation divided by the mean cell area within the population. standard deviations between cvs determined from three replicate experiments were also calculated. the cv in cell area in the absence of y <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig> ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the presence of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> μm y <dig> respectively. the absence of change in cell spreading even as diphospho-mlc signal decreased suggests that at least in this cell type, mlc diphosphorylation is not directly responsible for cell spread area. it should be noted that even though the cell spread area did not change with drug treatment, there appeared to be changes in cell shape and the roughness of cell edges. at the highest level of y <dig> treatment,  <dig> μm, there was a statistically significant increase in cell perimeter compared to untreated cells  . images of cells in the absence of y <dig> ,  <dig> μm y <dig>  and  <dig> μm y <dig>  are shown.

in the analysis presented thus far, we selectively considered single cells that were not in direct contact with other cells. the automated microscopy and staining techniques employed in this study allow us to determine if mlc diphosphorylation levels in single cells are different from levels in cells that are in contact with each other. cell-contact mediated through cadherins has been reported to change rhoa activity in several different cell types  <cit> . since rhoa is an upstream activator of rock, we examined possible downstream effects of cell-cell contact on cell spreading and mlc diphosphorylation. in the absence of y <dig> the average spread area per cell of pairs of cells that contacted each other appeared to be significantly less than that of isolated single cells . however, this difference was not observed upon treatment with y <dig> . furthermore, there was no apparent difference in mlc diphosphorylation per cell in pairs compared to single cells at any of the concentrations of y <dig> used . we conclude that under these conditions, cell-cell contact does not affect mlc diphosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle cells.

to further validate the method, we employed additional ways to perturb myosin light chain phosphorylation. ecm density influences myosin light chain phosphorylation by changing the functional coupling between rho and rock . hence we examined the effect of lowering ecm density on mlc phosphorylation. the coating concentration of fibronectin was lowered from  <dig> μg/ml to  <dig>  μg/ml. myosin phosphorylation on  <dig>  μg/ml fn surfaces was  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of controls  as measured by microscopy  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of controls as measured by western blotting . correspondingly, lowering ecm density also reduced the extent of cell spreading .

we also examined the effect of perturbations designed to increase mlc phosphorylation relative to controls. cells were treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin a to activate mlc phosphorylation, and mlc phosphorylation was measured by microscopy and western blotting. addition of  <dig> nm calyculin a to cells for  <dig> minutes increased mlc phosphorylation to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of untreated controls as measured by microscopy  and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of controls as measured by western blotting . there was a small but statistically significant decrease in cell area within  <dig> minutes after drug addition detected by quantitative microscopy . it was observed that cells completely rounded up at approximately  <dig> minutes after the addition of the drug .

we finally examined if the method could measure mlc phosphorylation in other cell types by using y <dig> to inhibit mlc phosphorylation in nih 3t <dig> cells.  <dig> μm y <dig> was found to inhibit mc phosphorylation by 85% relative to non-drug treated controls, both by quantitative microscopy and western blotting  without a statistically significant change in cell area .

discussion
we report here a robust protocol for quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy, where cell fixation, staining and imaging were optimized for quantitatively analyzing both cell morphology and mlc phosphorylation levels within individual adhered cells. this approach allows evaluation of the relationship between the two parameters. the use of careful consideration of staining protocols can quantitatively preserve phosphorylated proteins, as well as intracellular spatial information, and allows us to distinguish extent of phosphorylation in single cells from cells that are in contact with other cells.

using imaging cytometry, we determined that y <dig> inhibits mlc diphosphorylation with an ic <dig> of about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in a <dig> vascular smooth muscle cells, which was not significantly different from the value determined by western blotting under identical conditions. experiments measuring contractility response in vascular and bronchial smooth muscle strips indicated an ic <dig> between  <dig>  –  <dig> μm for y <dig>  <cit> . another study measuring the inhibition of neutrophil migration as a function of y <dig> concentration reported an ic <dig> value between 3– <dig> μm  <cit> . the correspondence between these sets of data indicates that the microscopy-based assay presented here likely provides an accurate determination of the level of diphospho-mlc in cells.

we tested the validity of the technique used here in a number of ways. we directly compared different fixation protocols for efficacy of retaining intracellular structure and phospho-mlc signal. we examined two different cell types: a <dig> vascular smooth muscle cells, and nih 3t <dig> cells, and compared average mlc phosphorylation measured by imaging cytometry to that determined by western blotting. we used several methods to perturb phospho-mlc levels including the use of y <dig> to inhibit rho kinase , plating cells on a low ecm density , and treating cells with an activator of contractility, calyculin a to increase mlc phosphorylation . in all cases, we found that measurement of mlc phosphorylation by microscopy corresponded to the same measurements by western blotting.

two enzymes are known to be principally responsible for activation of mlc by phosphorylation, myosin light chain kinase  and rho-associated kinase . since cytoskeletal tension is dependent partly on changes in mlc phosphorylation, pathways, and smooth muscles play an important role in regulating vascular tone, drugs regulating the latter have been the focus of drug discovery efforts for vascular therapies  <cit> . in this study we have used the rock inhibitor, y <dig>  and have quantified resulting inhibition of diphosphorylation of mlc. other reports have suggested that blocking mlck reduces mlc phosphorylation and cell spreading  <cit> , but blocking rock, which also inhibits mlc phosphorylation, does not reduce cell spreading  <cit> . we found that blocking rock does not appear to influence cell spread area, even though it quantitatively inhibits diphosphorylation of mlc. myosin light chain phosphorylation may be one of the variables that regulates cell spreading. other elements of the cytoskeleton such as actin, tubulin, linker and scaffolding proteins in focal adhesions may also be expected to play a role in the spreading process.

by simultaneously measuring cell morphology and corresponding mlc diphosphorylation levels in individual cells, we find that there is a linear relationship between cell spread area and the amount of mlc diphosphorylation. while the addition of the rock inhibitor y <dig> decreases the total amount of mlc diphosphorylation it does significantly affect the linear relationship between the two variables, and does not affect the range of cell spread areas observed across the population . we do measure subtle changes in cell shape, with an increase in roughness of the perimeter of cells, in the presence of  <dig> μm y <dig> . as demonstration of the topographical information that can be simultaneously extracted uniquely by quantitative microscopy, we compared myosin light chain phosphorylation between single cells not in contact with each other compared to pairs of cells in contact with each other measured by microscopy . the absence of difference on mlc phosphorylation between singles and pairs of cells suggests that cell-cell contact may not regulate mlc phosphorylation in this cell type.

the advantages of imaging cytometry compared to a technique such as western blotting are many: imaging provides additional information such as variation in response over the population and allows correlation of different parameters within individual cells. however the results of imaging cytometry are only useful if they result from validated protocols that provide accurate information about intracellular components. we hope that studies such as this will help to guide the process of critical evaluation of protocols as well as provide useful protocols for more accurately quantifying imaging results.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here indicate that it is possible to accurately measure phosphorylation of myosin light chain in large numbers of individual cells using automated immunofluorescence microscopy, provided that adequate care is taken to validate fixation, staining and quantification protocols. the morphological information afforded by microscopy can be coupled with quantitative intensity information to study phosphorylation events in cell signaling in relation to other cellular parameters. using this technique it should be possible to screen pharmaceutical compounds for their effects on myosin activity-based cell behaviors such as cell spreading, growth, and migration.

importantly, this study shows that measurements on individual cells can reveal trends that population-averaged measurements can mask. one important observation is that the different levels of phospho-myosin measured in individual cells constitute a reproducible distribution of responses across the cell population, suggesting the stochastic nature of the phosphorylation reaction.
