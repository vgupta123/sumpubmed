BACKGROUND
plant cultivation in space will be necessary to augment stored foods when space mission distances and durations increase, such as for long term bases on the moon and mars, and even being considered for orbiting bases such as the international space station . plants can play an important role in supplying nutrients, oxygen, and water to humans and can be co-utilized for waste recycling in space  <cit> , therefore, establishment of the culture approaches and breeding/developing plants to optimize their performance in space will be critical to future advanced space life support systems. in space, plants can be exposed to unusual and extreme environments, such as space radiation, reduced gravity, reduced atmospheric pressure, elevated or super-elevated co <dig> concentrations, and temperature excursions. in orbital, spaceflight cabin, lunar and martian bases, environmental conditions for plant cultivation such as temperature, light, air, and water could be controlled, however, it would be hard to eliminate space radiation and reduced gravity, which are suspected to perturb plant growth and development.

space radiation and microgravity are suggested to generate reactive oxygen species  in plants. ionizing radiation produced ros  <cit>  and increased lipid peroxidation products in erythrocytes of mice housed for about  <dig> days in iss  <cit> , and exposure of arabidopsis seedlings and callus cells to altered gravitational forces  up-regulated genes associated with cellular signaling, protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, defense, stress response, and gravisensing  <cit> . gene expression profiles have been analyzed to understand the stress level and adaptation challenges in plants grown in space. arabidopsis plants  launched and grown for  <dig> days in the space shuttle showed that the genes of hsp, drought-inducible calcium binding protein, a mads-box protein, and map kinases were induced 4-fold, compared with those of ground control  <cit> . pathogen response, wounding, drought, and cold associated genes, a gene associated with auxin-mediated lateral root development, and an essential regulator gene of photorespiration were up-regulated more than five-fold in the arabidopsis seedlings, which were germinated and grown for  <dig> days in the space shuttle. in addition, genes associated heat shock, salt, drought, metals, wounding, phosphate, ethylene, senescence, terpenoids, seed development, cell walls, photosynthesis, and auxin were up-regulated by more than five-fold in the culture cells grown for  <dig> days in the space shuttle  <cit> . these results indicate that plant genes in the ros network, which are induced by abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> , can be triggered by changes related to the spaceflight environment. however, because of the limitation of launching and cultivation in space, few studies on gene expression profiles have been performed, and in many cases plant materials were transported to orbit , subjecting them to transient responses that may not have been due to spaceflight environment.

we have developed a plant growth system, namely lada, which was installed in iss to study and grow plants, including vegetables in a spaceflight environment. we have succeeded in cultivating mizuna, tomato, pea, radish, wheat, rice, and barley in lada aboard iss. both m <dig> and m <dig> pea grown from seeds formed during spaceflight showed no significant difference in growth, developmental characteristics, frequency of chromosome aberrations in primary root meristem, and level of molecular polymorphism between offspring of space-grown and ground control seeds  <cit> . on the other hand, transcription levels of superoxide dismutase, glutamyl transferase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were increased in the barley germinated and grown for  <dig> days in lada, though the whole-plant growth and development of the barley in spaceflight were the same as in the ground control barley  <cit> . these results suggest that plants can adapt to spaceflight environment by changing their ros gene network.

in this study, we investigated the response of the ros gene network in mizuna, brassica rapa var. nipposinica, cultivated for  <dig> days in iss. mizuna is one of the model plants for cultivating in lada aboard iss because it is a leafy vegetable that can fully develop in  <dig> weeks in order to supply not only a plant material for investigating the effect of spaceflight environment but also a fresh vegetable for astronauts to take nutrient and benefit mental health quickly  <cit> . the ros gene network consists of a vast numbers genes, therefore, large-scale transcriptome analysis is necessary to clarify the stress level and adaptation challenges in plants under the spaceflight environment. the mrna-seq strategy using next generation sequencing  technology has become a powerful tool for analyzing genome-wide gene expression and global transcriptional networks. mrna-seq overcomes the limitations of microarray analysis, of which the probes are designed on the basis of a reference genome sequence of model species and cover only small portion of a gene. we demonstrated that an overall gene expression of the ros gene network in the space-grown mizuna was characterized by mapping reads from the ngs analysis to the brassica database as a reference genome sequence and annotating genes. our results provide a survey of plant response to the spaceflight environment and define common and different genes and cascades in the ros gene network for adapting to the spaceflight environment.

RESULTS
growth of mizuna in space
the seeds of mizuna was transported to iss, germinated, and grown in “lada”, plant growth chamber aboard the russian segment of iss, which has successfully produced a harvest of fresh vegetables and seeds in space  <cit> . the fresh weight and water content of the space-grown mizuna were  <dig>  g and  <dig> %, and those of the ground-grown mizuna were  <dig>  g and  <dig> %, respectively, after  <dig> days of cultivation, showing that mizuna grew as well or better under spaceflight environment in iss as well as on the ground. the reduced growth of the ground controls was likely due to the close matching of watering protocols for space and ground plants, which resulted in slower germination on the ground and some wilting symptoms of some ground control plants just prior to harvest. although similar amounts of water were being added to space and ground plants, the tendency of water to settle to the bottom of the root trays on the ground  could have affected overall growth.

construction of the mizuna transcript dataset and identification of differentially expressed transcripts
total reads of transcripts from the space-grown and the ground-grown mizuna by paired-end sequencing assay were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  also,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  of transcripts of total reads were mapped to the reference brassica rapa genome sequence, respectively. a g-test  was performed on the read count of transcripts to detect differences in gene expression between the space-grown and the ground-grown mizuna, and to identify responsive transcripts of the space-grown mizuna. the numbers of up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts were  <dig>  and  <dig> , which respectively included  <dig> and  <dig>  unannotated transcripts .

these responsive genes were functionally characterized using gene ontology  enrichment analysis. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  probe sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes were respectively assigned to  <dig> and  <dig> terms in biological process category. the greatest increase in up-regulated genes occurred in oxidation-reduction process , followed by protein phosphorylation , the total of which represented 48% of biological process, whereas that of down-regulated genes was protein phosphorylation , which represents 38% . cytochrome p <dig> and protein kinase were the main genes in oxidation-reduction process and protein phosphorylation, respectively. cytochrome p <dig> is associated with the detoxification reactions of xenobiotic compounds activated to electrophilic molecules to maintain the redox homeostasis  <cit> . protein kinases play key roles in signal transduction under abiotic and biotic stress. these results suggest that redox-oxidation state was perturbed and that signal transduction is regulated in the cells of the space-grown mizuna.

expression profiles of oxidative marker and ros-scavenging genes
table  <dig> shows  <dig> ros oxidative marker genes up-regulated more than five-fold by hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, or singlet oxygen in arabidopsis, including putative trypsin inhibitor , unknown protein , unknown protein , transmembrane receptor , and unknown protein , which are regarded as hallmarks for the general oxidative stress response  <cit> . in the space-grown mizuna,  <dig> of  <dig> genes were up-regulated more than five-fold. especially,  <dig> of  <dig> hallmark genes, bra <dig> , bra <dig> and bra <dig> , bra <dig> , bra <dig> , showed a greater than ten-fold increase in expression. these results show that the spaceflight environment induces oxidative stress in the cells of space-grown mizuna.

transcripts representing ros-induced genes in at leaset six out of eight stress experiments in arabidopsis reported by gadjev et al.  <cit>  are listed. fold change values of the space-grown mizuna genes associated with the listed arabidopsis genes are shown. nd, not detected.

ros-scavenging genes are induced to defend the cells from oxidative stress. the expression level of transcripts associated with arabidopsis ros-scavenging genes  <cit>  was confirmed in the space-grown mizuna . in fact,  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated more than two-fold, including the major ros-scavenging enzymes: superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. a dramatic induction occurred in thioredoxin  and glutaredoxin  genes, of which the levels were increased more than 40-fold. thioredoxin and glutaredoxin belong to the thioredoxin superfamily known to be crucial for maintaining a reduced intracellular redox state and oxidative defense  <cit> . alternative oxidase   was another highly expressed gene, with  <dig> -fold up-regulation. aox activity increases in plants under oxidative stress such as drought and salinity, and aox functions as an antioxidant enzyme, acting to alleviate ros accumulation  <cit> . these results suggest that the mizuna modulates ros-scavenging genes to eliminate oxidative stress induced by the spaceflight environment.

expression profiles of ros-responsive transcription factor genes
plants sense the ros level and change the expression of genes comprising the ros signal network that regulate growth, development, and stress defense. the ros signals are induced via mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascades, which play a crucial role in abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants . in arabidopsis, mekk <dig>  oxi <dig>  and anp <dig> have been shown to function upstream to mapk cascades. the mekk1-mkk1/mkk2-mpk <dig> cascade was shown to a key regulator of ros stress signaling  <cit>  and an mekk1-mkk2-mpk4/mpk <dig> cascade was identified in cold and salt stress  <cit> . an mekk1-mkk4/mkk5-mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade was shown to function in protoplasts treated with bacterial flagellin peptide  <cit>  and mkk <dig> regulated mpk <dig> under salt stress  <cit> . an anp1-mkk4/mkk5-mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade was shown in h2o <dig> treated arabidopsis plants  <cit> . an oxi1-mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade was activated by ros  <cit>  and an oxi1-ndpk2-mpk3/mpk <dig> was suggested to enhance tolerance against freezing and salinity  <cit> . aside from the induction of mekk <dig>  anp <dig>  and oxi <dig> by h2o <dig>  oxi <dig> is activated by pdk <dig> via the plc/d-pa pathway. the expression levels of the genes in the space-grown mizuna associated with arabidopsis mapk cascades are presented in figure  <dig>  mekk <dig> , oxi <dig> , mkk <dig> , and mpk <dig>  were up-regulated more than five-fold, indicating that mekk1-mkk4-mpk <dig>  oxi1-mkk4-mpk <dig>  and oxi1-mpk <dig> cascades were strongly activated via ros under spaceflight environment. the expression of pdk <dig> gene  by  <dig> -fold shows that plc/d-pa-pdk <dig> pathway is not related to the up-regulation of oxi <dig> gene.

transcription factor genes wrky and zat respond to oxidative stress to control the expression of ros network genes, of which  <dig> wrky and  <dig> zat genes respond with more than five-fold expression by oxidative stress in arabidopsis <cit> . in the space-grown mizuna,  <dig> wrky and  <dig> zat genes were shown to have more than five-fold expression . reportedly mekk1-mee4/mkk5-mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade activates wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in the flagellin-treated arabidopsis <cit> . the expression levels of wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig>  in space-grown mizuna were  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively, suggesting the activation of mekk1-mkk4-mpk3-wrky <dig> cascade. it was indicated to the negative control of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and zat <dig> by mekk1-mkk1/mkk2-mpk <dig> cascade  <cit> , however, wrky <dig> , wrky <dig> , and zat <dig>  genes were up-regulated in the space-grown mizuna, suggesting that the mekk1-mkk1-mpk <dig> cascade in the space-grown mizuna regulates other transcription factors or ros network genes. zat <dig> is the inducer of wrky <dig> and zat <dig> overexpression plants suppressed zat <dig>  which up-regulate wrky <dig>  <cit> . up-regulation of zat <dig> and wrky <dig> genes and lack of expression or down-regulation of zat <dig> and wrky <dig> genes in the space-grown mizuna suggest that zat <dig> is a regulator in the ros signal transduction pathway involved in the spaceflight environment as well as abiotic and biotic stress.

to confirm the predicted active mapk cascade and transcription factor genes in the space-grown mizuna by mrna-seq, gene expression was analyzed by quantitative rt-pcr using gene-specific primers . the expression levels of oxi <dig>  mekk <dig>  mkk <dig>  mpk <dig>  zat <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> were increased  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 3-fold, respectively, in the space-grown mizuna . this result correlates with that of mrna-seq, supporting the predicted active mapk cascade and transcription factor genes under the spaceflight environment.

expression profiles of ros-producing genes
reactive oxygen species are used as a signal molecular in plants to amplify the ros signal network to activate defense mechanisms against abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> . nadph oxidases play a key role in producing ros. rbohd and rbohf genes of nadph oxidases in arabidopsis were induced by oxidative stress, leading to maintain the stress defense system  <cit> . there were  <dig> nadph oxidase genes identified in space-grown mizuna and rbohd  and rbohf  genes were up-regulated by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively . this result suggests that space-grown mizuna produces ros to maintain the activation of ros signal network to control the defense system with ros-scavenging system.

CONCLUSIONS
plants respond to environmental stress in multiple ways and have evolved mechanisms to increase their tolerance to the stress through interactive molecular and cellular changes. the components of these changes are responses of integrated ros gene network triggered under stressful conditions. our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the spaceflight environment induced oxidative stress and activated a ros gene network in the space-grown mizuna, some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and some of which were preferentially up-regulated genes by the spaceflight environment, even though mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground. up-regulation of aox, rbohd, and rbohf genes, activation of more than one mapk cascades, and regulation of zat <dig> and wrky <dig> by zat <dig> are common in plants under space, abiotic, biotic stress. preferential high expression of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin genes, no repression of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and zat <dig> by mekk1-mkk1/mkk2-mpk <dig> cascade, and no induction of oxi <dig> by plc/d-pa-pdk <dig> pathway are different from those under abiotic and biotic stress. these results show that the ros gene network for abiotic and biotic stress response and tolerance, which plants have developed to adapt the environment on the earth, could serve to acclimate plant to the abiotic stress conditions of the spaceflight environment.
