BACKGROUND
recent progress in genomic research using the model species a. thaliana and crop species, such as rice, maize, sorghum and tomato, has dramatically enhanced our capacity to unravel the genetic basis of biological diversity and the evolution of complex traits and genetic pathways in plants. these include genes and pathways determining plant architecture and fruit size  <cit> , flowering time  <cit> , light response  <cit>  and plant defence  <cit> . however, when studying fundamentals about how organisms have adapted to their natural environments, the information derived especially from crops is of limited application. in these species, many of the traits have undergone intensive artificial selection over the course of directed genetic improvement. in addition, these plant species are often highly inbred due to either artificial selection or self-pollination, which may lead to an increased likelihood of accumulating deleterious alleles, and consequently the loss of atypical patterns of much of the genetic variation displayed in natural systems  <cit> . it is, therefore, critical to identify and develop new model species from natural settings, with well-defined ecologies and abundant examples of adaptation to various environments to advance our understanding of plant evolution, development and ecology.

several important factors need to be carefully weighed when choosing new model species to develop tools for genomic studies  <cit> . first, it is desirable that the new systems encompass a wide range of morphological and ecological diversity occurring in the flowering plants. this will not only allow understanding of the morphological variation in response to critical phenomena, but also facilitate investigation of the physiological adaptation to new environments. second, with the information accumulated from the increasing number of model systems within grasses  and core eudicots , the development of phylogenetically intermediate model systems would greatly facilitate genome comparisons among these taxa and bridge the deep evolutionary distance between the well-developed arabidopsis and rice model systems  <cit> . third, it is ideal that genetic resources developed for new model systems could be transferable to a wide-range of related species, serving to address many questions for the community at large  <cit> .

aquilegia, the columbine genus  <cit> , is emerging as a new evolutionary genomic model in a relatively unstudied area of the plant phylogenetic tree, the basal eudicots. aquilegia species are so closely related that they have been considered a species flock or syngameon  <cit> . this group was extensively studied by verne grant as an interesting example of recent adaptive radiation leading to rapid speciation  <cit> . variation in pollinators has apparently driven the evolution of a wide variety of floral morphologies and, along with adaptation to different habitats, likely induced rapid reproductive isolation  <cit> . approximately  <dig> different species in north america emerged in as little as 1- <dig> million years  <cit>  resulting in little sequence variation in dna regions such as chloroplast and rdna  <cit> . remarkably, ecologically and morphologically distinct species share the majority of sequence polymorphisms making them difficult to distinguish at the molecular level  <cit> , which again suggests that these taxa are of very recent origin. as such, it is not surprising that it has long been known that species of aquilegia are highly cross-compatible  <cit>  which provides an opportunity for genetic studies across multiple fields such as ecology, physiology and morphology  <cit> . the feature of cross compatibility not only facilitates the genetic dissection of traits, but also suggests that genomic tools developed from a single species will be readily transferred to a wide range of additional species  <cit> .

phylogenetically, aquilegia belongs to the plant family ranunculaceae, which is a basal-eudicot lineage  <cit> . this position of being approximately equidistant, evolutionarily, from the current monocot  and core-eudicot  model plant systems provides a unique opportunity for comparative studies among angiosperms of sequence information, genome structure, and the conservation/diversification of developmental pathways. for instance, it has been hypothesized that a whole-genome duplication occurred near the base of the eudicot lineage yet aquilegia, and thus the ranunculales, appears to have predated this event  <cit> . moreover, aquilegia possesses unusual floral morphology such as petaloid sepals, nectar spurs and a recently evolved novel floral organ, the staminodium, not available for study in current model systems  <cit> . these traits, along with its small genome size , all support aquilegia as an important new model for plant development, ecology and evolution.

here, we report the construction of a physical map of the a. formosa genome using the high information content fingerprinting  method  <cit> . a single individual from the wild was used for library construction because inbreeding depression has been found to be exceptionally strong in all species of aquilegia studied to date  <cit> . this plant has also been used as a grandparent in a large f <dig> cross between a. formosa and a. pubescens, which was utilized as the tissue source for a large est database http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=aquilegia and is being used for qtl mapping. in addition, we integrated a total of  <dig> markers  by multi-dimensional pool hybridization, and produced bac end sequences of a minimum tiling path. thus, the physical map described here integrates across a number of studies and genomic resources for aquilegia. the physical map and other information presented here will help facilitate the long-range assembly of aquilegia genome sequence and fine-scale mapping of qtls as well as comparative genomic studies. because all species of aquilegia are highly similar at the genetic level , this resource should be important for genomic studies spanning the entire genus.

RESULTS
bac library characterization
two complementary restriction derived large-insert bac libraries of a single a. formosa plant were used for constructing a physical map. tissue was collected in the wild along bishop creek inyo co., ca and sent to amplicon express  for library construction. this same individual a. formosa plant has been used as a parent to construct an a. formosa Ã— a. pubescens f <dig> population for genetic mapping and est sequencing  <cit> . as summarized in table  <dig>  the a. formosa hindiii bac library  has an estimated genome coverage of  <dig> x and contains  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig>  kb . the insert sizes range from 60- <dig> kb, and 87% of the clones have an insert size of  <dig> kb or larger. the library has  <dig> % empty vector clones. the a. formosa mboi bac library  has an estimated genome coverage of  <dig> x and contains  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig>  kb . the insert size range is 35- <dig> kb. the library contains  <dig> % clones with insert size of  <dig> kb or larger, and  <dig> % empty vector clones. other than these two libraries, a third bac library was constructed from a. coerulea "goldsmith" adq <dig>  which is currently being used for whole genome sequencing at joint genome institute  for comparative genomic studies. the library was created by partial digestion of high molecular weight genomic dna with hindiii according to the procedure of peterson et al.  <cit> . the library consisted of a total of  <dig>  clones with an average insert size of  <dig> kb to cover  <dig>  genome equivalents.

hicf fingerprinting
a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  clones from a. formosa af_bb and af_bc bac libraries, respectively, was successfully fingerprinted using hicf method of luo et al.  <cit> . the analysis resulted in an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bands per clone for the af_bb and af_bc libraries, respectively, with an overall average of  <dig>  bands per clone . of the  <dig>  successfully fingerprinted clones from both libraries,  <dig>  were successfully assigned electronic fingerprints with the genoprofiler  <cit>  software for subsequent assembly using fpc v <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . given  <dig> kb for the average insert size from both libraries, the clones included in the fpc project represent approximately 21x of aquilegia genome  .

physical map assembly
fingerprints from both bac libraries were combined for contig assembly using a tolerance of  <dig> and a cutoff of 1e- <dig>  the initial assembly resulted in  <dig>  contigs containing  <dig>   clones and  <dig>  singletons. eight clones were manually removed due to poor fingerprinting. the average sulston score was  <dig> . after using the dqer to break up contigs consisting of more than 10% questionable clones, a consecutive reduction in stringency at 1e- <dig> for each end-end and single-end merge using the "clone plus markers " function at a tolerance of  <dig> was performed to reassemble contigs. the final systematic contig assembly was calculated at a cutoff value of 1e- <dig>  further manual contig merges, based on the results from marker hybridization , were conducted at a cutoff value of 1e- <dig> and tolerance of  <dig>  and resulted in a total of  <dig> contigs consisting of  <dig>   clones and  <dig>  singletons . a minimal tiling path  was selected using default parameters of fpc and  <dig>  clones were selected for end sequencing.

overgo probe hybridization and marker integration
to bridge genetic and physical maps and isolate a list of genes implicated in environmental adaptations, floral development and color for further studies, overgo probes were developed from  a list of markers that had been genetically mapped,  a list of ests expressed upon drought stress,  a list of genes potentially related to anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit>  and  a list of genes associated with flower development. each hybridization experiment included a total of  <dig> markers assigned in  <dig> pools and each pool consisted of  <dig> markers . we considered a "hit"  as one that all three different pools containing a probe produced a clear hybridization signal. this 3-dimentional-pool hybridization approach has the advantage of reducing the number of false positive clones. results from the first pool hybridization anchored a total of  <dig> drought-induced genes to the physical map with  <dig> markers hybridized to a single contig,  <dig> to two contigs, and only  <dig> markers to three or more contigs . similarly, the second pool hybridization placed  <dig> markers on the map and anchored a total of  <dig> contigs. among these  <dig> markers were  <dig> genetically mapped markers that collectively anchored  <dig> contigs, covering a total of  <dig>  mb  . furthermore, most of these markers from the second pool hybridization were mapped to separate contigs, only  <dig> contigs contained  <dig> markers, and only  <dig> contig had  <dig> markers . all the markers, except tc <dig>  which failed to hybridize, were derived from genes potentially involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and mapped to different contigs . in summary, results from the two hybridization experiments anchored a total of  <dig> markers to the physical map. among the markers were  <dig> markers  mapped to single contigs,  <dig>  mapped to  <dig> contigs, and  <dig>  mapped to multiple  contigs. details of all contigs are available from the webfpc project located at http://www.genome.clemson.edu/physical_maps/aquilegia.

validation of the contig assembly
results from marker hybridization were also used to verify the contig assembly because, in theory, all clones that hybridized to a non-repetitive overgo probe are expected to be in the same contig. alternatively, positive clones could be located at the ends of different contigs that do not have enough overlap to be assembled into a single contig under the stringency used for the analysis. on the other hand, bac clones from unrelated contigs would be hybridized if an overgo probe happens to contain a repeat. to test these predictions we randomly chose ctg <dig>  from among those contigs that had multiple probe hybridizations. pool hybridization anchored three markers to this contig. the first marker, aq_sr_ctg_ <dig>  hybridized to  <dig> clones, among which were  <dig> clones  clustered in this contig, and the fifth clone was not included in the fpc project due to failed fingerprint. the second marker, aq_sr_ctg_ <dig>  hybridized to  <dig> clones, of which  <dig> clones  were neighbouring to each other in this contig, and of the remaining  <dig> clones  <dig> were singletons  and  <dig> clone  did not fingerprint. the third marker, aq_sr_ctg_ <dig>  resulted in  <dig> positive hits that were all clustering next to each other in this contig . furthermore, hybridization with the overgo probe derived from the t7-primed bac end sequence of af__bb010h19f  from the same contig identified  <dig> clones,  <dig> of which were also next to each other in this contig . the remaining  <dig> bacs not in this contig were   <dig> clone not included in the project due to the failed fingerprint and   <dig> clones located at the very two ends of another contig, ctg <dig> , possibly due to the presence of low copy homologous sequence shared with the probe. thus, the hybridization results were consistent with and in support of the contig assembly, which is based on the fingerprint similarity of the bacs.

in another independent validation analysis, oligo primers were designed from a set of  <dig> markers for pcr amplification on all positively hybridized clones. as summarized in table  <dig>  other than aq_sr_ctg_ <dig> and aq_sr_ctg_ <dig>  which only gave 10/ <dig> and 3/ <dig> successful pcr amplifications, respectively, the remaining  <dig> markers allowed amplification of expected amplicons from all positive clones. for example, overgo marker aq_sr_ctg_ <dig> derived from an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> homolog hybridized to  <dig> positive bacs, and pcr analysis using a gene-specific primer pair generated matching amplicons from all these  <dig> positive clones, confirming the potential presence of the gene in these clones. the results were also consistent with the contig assembly in which  <dig> of the  <dig> clones were assembled in a patch in ctg <dig>  while the absence of the last bac was due to failed hicf fingerprinting of the clone, which in turn excluded the clone from the framework physical map. in summary, a physical map was constructed through  <dig> major steps. first, an initial build was generated under high stringency with a sulston score at  <dig> . second, contigs were further connected through a series of automated merges utilizing consecutive stepping-down stringencies from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  third, the physical map was further analyzed by manual editing of the contigs at lower cutoff at 1e- <dig> and tolerance at  <dig> according to marker hybridization data and an increased requirement for three end clone matches. the fidelity of the contig build could be confirmed by two sequence-based approaches, including  identification of neighbouring clones by hybridization with probes derived from bac-end sequence of the same contig, and  analysis of the pcr amplicons generated from positively hybridized clones.

bac end sequencing
bac end sequencing from both forward and reverse directions of  <dig>  bacs covering a minimal tiling path of the physical framework generated a total of  <dig>   high quality sequences  with an average length of  <dig> bases. this was equivalent to one sequence tag per  <dig>  kb . after filtering for vector contamination and trimming for quality, the bess were deposited in genbank's gss sequence repository: library af_bb has accessions er936645-er <dig> and library af_bc has accessions er967023-er <dig>  comparison of the bess to multiple plant chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes indicated a low level of plastid-origin bacs,  <dig> % for each organelle. the bac sequences, excluding those of putative plastid origins, encompass  <dig> , <dig> base pairs, which corresponds to approximately  <dig> % of the aquilegia genome  <cit> .

the bac end sequences have an average gc content of  <dig> %. microsatellites were identified from  <dig>  bess, and primers could be designed to flank  <dig>  of the ssrs. these putatively mappable markers include  <dig> dinucleotide repeats,  <dig> trinucleotide repeats,  <dig> tetranucleotide repeats, and  <dig> pentanucleotide repeats.

a set of  <dig>  sequences matched known transposable elements. considering only the best matching element for each bac end sequence, the most commonly matched species from the database was grapevine  with  <dig> bac ends having matches to grapevine elements. the matches encompassed  <dig> different repetitive elements including multiple members of the gypsy, copia, mudr and en/spm classes. these matches had an average smith-waterman score of  <dig>  the next most common organisms for matches consisted of a. thaliana , populus trichocarpa , followed by medicago truncatula , and oryza sativa .

the most commonly identified individual element was atlantys1_ <dig> that matched  <dig> a. formosa bac ends. atlantys1_ <dig> represents an internal coding segment of the larger atlantys endogenous retrovirus in the ty3-gypsy family. this family is widespread across plants; atlantys accounts for much of the genome size variation in rice  <cit>  and also has repbase records originating from a. thaliana, lotus japonicus, and sorghum bicolor. other commonly identified elements include copia42-ptr_i, an ltr retrotransposon from populus matching  <dig> bac ends; popgy1_i, the internal portion of a gypsy-type retroelement matching  <dig> bac ends; and copia-31-ltr_vv, a ltr retrotransposon from v. vinifera matching  <dig> bac ends 

after filtration of organelle, transposable elements and repetitive sequences, the remaining bess were assembled with cap <dig>  <cit>  followed by mining for potential gene coding regions. the assembly resulted in  <dig>  singlets and  <dig> contigs. two different strategies were used to identify potential coding regions in the unique sequences. in the first approach, the non-redundant dataset was compared to the tentative aquilegia consensus est sequences from the gene index project  <cit>  with tblastx  <cit>  at a stringency of 1e- <dig>  the results indicated  <dig>  of the genomic sequences have at least one est match. as the est resource represented only an imperfect representation of the transcriptome, a blastx of arabidopsis, oryza and vitis gene models was further performed with a cut-off e value of 1e- <dig> in the second approach, resulting in an additional  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> potential coding non-redundant bac ends, respectively. of the  <dig> non-redundant sequences,  <dig>   were flagged as potential coding regions.

an overall comparison to three plant model genomes was performed by a blastn  <cit>  of all the bess to the whole genome sequences with an e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  aquilegia sequences exhibited relatively low similarity to a. thaliana and o. sativa with only  <dig> and  <dig> matches, respectively, while there were  <dig> matches with v. vinifera genome . the results provided the first global sequence information to support the phylogenetic placement of aquilegia in angiosperms, and the observation from the shared transposable element between aquilegia and the grapevine further reiterates the close colineage between these two clades. the fact that aquilegia genome contains transposable elements similar to both monocot and eudicot species also highlights the uniqueness of aquilegia in studying plant evolution. we identified  <dig> aquilegia bac-end sequences that aligned with one or more of the  <dig> chromosome-based pseudomolecules of the vitis genome  and  <dig> sequences aligned to unanchored vitis genomic sequence. the alignment of the  <dig> aquilegia bess to the corresponding chromosome-based pseudomolecules of vitis genome was summarized in table  <dig>  using the series of synteny mapping algorithms, we mapped  <dig> blocks of synteny to the v. vinifera draft genome assembly .

discussion
aquilegia represents a unique clade of basal eudicots possessing a number of important unique features, including its phylogenetic position in the lower eudicots, unusual floral morphology , and its distribution in diverse ecological habitats. collectively, all these traits contributed to aquilegia being developed as a new model system for studying floral variation, adaptive radiations and evolution  <cit> . to further understand the genome structure and provide molecular insights bridging monocots and eudicots and facilitate molecular dissection of the traits associated with inflorescence development and environmental adaptations, a bac-based genomic resource, including three bac libraries and a physical map, was developed in this study. among the three libraries were two libraries derived from a. formosa, representing  <dig> x and  <dig> x genome equivalents, respectively, for physical map construction. a third library was constructed from a. coerulea goldsmith to have  <dig> x genome coverage for further comparative genomics studies to address the molecular basis for floral variation and adaptive radiation within the genus. the aquilegia physical map was composed of  <dig>  clones and had a deep 21x genome coverage. furthermore, a collection of bacs orchestrating a minimal tiling path from the contig assembly were isolated for bac end sequencing to provide a glimpse of the genome organization of this model plant. both the physical map and the bess could also serve as landmarks for genome sequence assembly and anchoring ests to the genome. marker hybridizations using a total of  <dig> markers associated with drought-stress, anthocyanin biosynthesis and floral development not only allowed integration of genetic map into the contig framework, but also identified candidate genomic regions for further gene isolation and characterization. the genome resource is expected to serve as a pivotal platform for comparative genomics study to elucidate genome variations between monocots and basal eudicot and to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying environment adaptation and floral variations.

in recent years, hicf fingerprinting has been commonly applied to replace traditional agarose  <cit>  and polyacrylamide gel methods  <cit>  in various genome fingerprinting projects due to its high-throughput procedure, increased number of fragments generated from each clone and more improved contig assembly than other approaches  <cit> . in this study, an average of  <dig> restriction fragments was generated from the clones in the fpc project. the high-informative fingerprints provided high resolution identity from each clone for accurate contig assembly that can be further verified by marker hybridization in which  <dig>  of the total  <dig> genetic markers hybridized to only  <dig> or  <dig> contigs instead of scattering around the entire genome. furthermore, the positively hybridized clones were overlapped in clusters in most contigs, indicating that the contig assembly, which is based on fingerprinting similarity, is consistent with the sequence-based results. the accuracy of contig assembly could also be verified by pcr amplicon analysis as shown in table  <dig>  thus, we are confident with the strategy for building a physical map that begins with contig assembly at high stringency at cutoff 1e- <dig> and tolerance  <dig>  which gave a high average sulston score of  <dig> , followed by a series of end-end and single-end merges of the small bac scaffolds under gradually decreased stringency till 1e- <dig>  followed by further manual editing at 1e- <dig> based on marker hybridization data. among the successful  <dig> markers used for the hybridization were  <dig> markers that have been genetically mapped; these markers anchored a total of  <dig> contigs that cover  <dig>  mb  on all  <dig> linkage groups . these mapped contigs not only organize a framework to study the aquilegia genome, but also pave the way for gene isolation and characterization by map-based cloning approach to further understand the genes of interest.

the genes involved in anthocyanin pigmentation biosynthesis in wheat are arranged in a gene cluster in the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . similar clustering of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites was also reported from grapevine  <cit> . unlike these species, the  <dig> anthocyanin biosynthesis related genes in aquilegia appear to be dispersed in the genome , suggesting the unique deployment of the genes in this lower eudicot genus. however, a number of additional genes belonging to the anthocyanin and broader flavonoid pathway have been identified  <cit>  but not assayed here, and therefore the possibility cannot be ruled out that some gene clustering might be identified in the future. the contigs anchored from this study could serve as resource for unravelling the molecular basis underlying floral color variation and evolution.

an expansion in the physical span of the contigs was observed in this study. the collective physical span of all contigs as calculated by the cb map function of fpc software  <cit>  was estimated to be  <dig>  mb . as only  <dig> marker hybridization results were analyzed and these markers were biased toward specific biological functions, it cannot be ruled out, although unlikely, that the contig assembly is not best optimized and some contigs remain to be further merged together. as the single a. formosa individual used for bac library construction has been shown to be highly heterozygous at more than  <dig> ssr and snp loci , the excessive physical length might be due to the heterozygous genome collected from the field that was composed of highly diverse haplotype dnas as a result of the outcrossing nature of the species. similar inflated length from physical map has been reported from other outcrossing species, including poplar  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit> . as the genome sequencing project is near finishing, further assembly and analysis of genome sequence will uncover more details about the genome components and suggest events that took place affecting genome structure of this basal eudicot taxa. to maintain the accuracy in contig assembly, further reduction in stringency to merge more contigs was not pursued in this study. in the future, fingerprint contig assembly can be refined through more hybridizations using additional mapped markers and probes designed from the end clones of contigs.

the bess from the minimal tiling path clones also provided insights into the genome composition of this novel model plant, including low gc content, transposable elements and gene content. interestingly, higher homology in putative coding regions shared between aquilegia and the grapevine, v. vinifera, in comparison to two other model plants, including rice and arabidopsis was also observed . as vitis is affiliated with the earliest diverging lineage of rosids in the core eudicots of the angiosperms  <cit> , and aquilegia is in basal eudicots in the phylogenetic tree  <cit> , the close conservation between these two species not only provides a global molecular evidence to support the phylogenetic lineage that connects basal eudicots to core eudicots but also provides a rich resource for investigating the genome evolution, such as the events of genome duplication and subsequence variation  <cit> , in the course from monocots to eudicots in angiosperms. in this report, preliminary comparative genomics studies using symap uncovered  <dig> syntenic blocks between aquilegia and vitis . these syntenies provide a first glimpse of the aquilegia structural organization and a rich resource to trace the events of dna translocation during the evolution of these two lineages. further characterization of the shared transposable elements from the aquilegia genome will also provide insights into the evolution of plants. more extensive survey using the whole-genome sequence information in the near future is expected to aid in-depth studies into the evolution genomics of the basal eudicot taxa. on the other hand, the discovery that alignment of the bess from the physical framework contigs failed to identify significant synteny with other reported genomes also reiterates the significance of the unique genome structure of aquilegia in understanding the evolution of the plant genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the bac-based genome resource established from this study, including deep genome coverage libraries from a. formosa and a. coerulea, a partially integrated physical map is expected to promote better understanding of the genome structure of the unique intermediate between rice and arabidopsis. it will also provide tremendous insights into the molecular clues and genetic networks underlying ecological adaption and morphological diversity. results from the analysis of the bess derived from the minimal tiling path  indicated a close similarity in both transposable elements and annotated gene models with the grapevine genome further suggesting the significance of the genome resource in studying the molecular elements involved in the lineage of evolution progression. this genomic resource is expected to facilitate comparative genomics research, gene isolation and characterization to address the unique biological feature of this novel model plant.
