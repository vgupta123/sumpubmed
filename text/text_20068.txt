BACKGROUND
development of the vertebrate central nervous system  is initiated during gastrulation when dorsal ectodermal cells are converted to the neural fate. there are two prevailing models for the induction of the cns. the first, the neural default model, arose from experiments demonstrating that in the absence of bone morphogenetic protein  signaling, amphibian ectodermal explants form neural tissue instead of epidermis  <cit> . formation of the nervous system by default is highly conserved. in the protostome drosophila melanogaster, neural tissue forms as a result of inhibition of the bmp homolog decapentaplegic  by the chordin ortholog sog  <cit> . furthermore, the xenopus bmp antagonist noggin is sufficient to inhibit dpp and induce neuroectoderm in fruit flies  <cit> , and overexpression of sog induces a secondary axis in xenopus embryos  <cit> . the second model, the instructive signaling model, arose from studies of chick embryonic development and indicated that inhibition of bmp signaling is not sufficient to induce neural tissue, and that instruction from another signaling pathway such as fgf , is required. there is evidence supporting both models in multiple vertebrates  <cit> , thus feeding the controversy over which signals are necessary and sufficient during vertebrate cns induction.

experiments in es cells, mouse and zebrafish embryos support the model that the vertebrate cns is formed by default. like xenopus ectodermal explants  <cit> , mouse es cells  <cit> , and human es  <cit>  and induced pluripotent stem cells  <cit>  are converted to rostral neural tissue when bmp signaling is inhibited. in the mouse epiblast, bmp2/ <dig> signaling maintains pluripotency and prevents the acquisition of a neural fate, whereas inhibition of bmp signaling induces neural tissue independent of fgf signaling  <cit> . similarly, in zebrafish, bmp inhibition is sufficient for the induction of anterior neural genes and fgf signaling is not required for induction but rather for posteriorization of the induced tissue  <cit> .

although bmp inhibition clearly plays a role in neural specification in many organisms, alone it does not effectively induce neural tissue formation in xenopus ventral ectoderm  <cit>  or outside of the chick dorsal ectoderm  <cit> , which indicates that an instructive signal is required. the leading candidate for this instructive signal is fgf. in both chick and frog, overexpression of fgf <dig>  fgf <dig>  or fgf <dig> induces the expression of posterior neural genes  <cit>  and the activation of fgf signaling in combination with bmp antagonism induces the expression of pan-neural genes in non-neural ectodermal territories  <cit> . loss of function studies in mescs, chick and xenopus embryos also suggest a role for instructive signaling by fgf in neural induction. for example, inhibition of fgf receptors or erk1/ <dig> by exposure to pharmacological inhibitors eliminated differentiation of mescs into neurons  <cit>  and resulted in a loss of neural tissue in frog  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit>  and chick  <cit> . furthermore, overexpression of the dominant negative fgf receptor 4a reduced the expression of the neural progenitor marker, sox <dig>  in tailbud-stage xenopus embryos  <cit>  and the formation of neural tissue in ectodermal explants in response to noggin  <cit> .

it has been difficult to dissect out an independent role for fgf in neural induction because fgf signaling has significant roles in mesodermal development  <cit>  and neural anterior-posterior patterning  <cit> , induces neural tissue via interference with bmp transcription and transduction  <cit>  and has been proposed to maintain rather than induce a neural progenitor population  <cit> . specifically, studies suggest that neural specification in response to fgf is not instructive or independent from bmp inhibition but rather, is the result of interference with bmp signaling via inhibition of smad <dig> activity  <cit>  or the transcription of bmp  <cit> . it has also been proposed that fgf signaling is dispensable for induction and instead is required for the maintenance of neural progenitors. this is supported by studies in:  xenopus ectodermal explants in which sox <dig> and sox <dig> expression is not maintained when fgf signaling through fgfr <dig> and  <dig> is inhibited  <cit> ;  the mouse olfactory bulb and retina in which a proliferating progenitor population is decreased in the absence of fgf signaling  <cit>  and;  hescs in which exogenous fgf maintains cells in an undifferentiated state  <cit> . furthermore, the approaches and techniques used to investigate the role of fgf have been called to question. it has been argued that incorrect markers were analyzed at the wrong developmental stages and in the wrong tissues, and that doses of pharmacological inhibitors were lethal or detrimental to development  <cit> . with this conflicting data and the variables added by the use of many different model organisms, stages, neural markers and fgf inhibitors , it remains unclear if fgf signaling is required in addition to, or independent of, bmp inhibition for the induction of neural genes.

this study compares the regulatory requirements for the onset and maintenance of multiple early neural genes in xenopus embryos. using multiple genes in one organism has allowed us to determine whether fgf signaling is required for the induction of multiple early neural genes independent of bmp inhibition, and also to determine the role of fgf8a in neural development. using gain and loss of function assays, we show that sox <dig> and foxd5a require fgf signaling for neural induction and that sox <dig> and geminin require fgf signaling for maintenance of expression. ultimately, we show that depending on the gene of interest, the ability of fgf to induce expression can be dependent on the absence of bmp signaling and may be indirect via the induction of mesoderm.

RESULTS
response of early neural genes to bmp inhibition and fgf signaling
the early neural genes sox <dig>  sox <dig>  geminin, foxd5a, soxd and zicr <dig> are expressed broadly in the neuroectoderm at the time of neural induction in response to neural inducing signals  <cit> . we compared their expressions at stage  <dig> , through the onset of gastrulation and neural induction  and in neurula embryos  . the maternal genes, soxd, sox <dig> and geminin are expressed strongly at  <dig> hpf whereas foxd5a, which is also maternally expressed, is expressed at low levels at  <dig> hpf with levels increasing at  <dig> hpf and peaking at  <dig> hpf. the expression levels of the zygotically expressed gene zicr <dig> are fairly constant whereas sox <dig> levels increase from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. both fgf <dig> and the bmp antagonist, noggin are expressed at  <dig> hpf preceding neural induction. all of the genes are expressed prior to the onset of gastrulation with zygotic fgf <dig> expressed prior to foxd5α and sox <dig> expression indicating that it may play a role in the induction of these two genes but not the others.

to determine if the early neural genes respond to bmp antagonism and/or fgf signaling, we overexpressed noggin, fgf8a or a combination of both and analyzed the expression of the early neural genes and the proneural gene neurogenin . we used fgf8a because its misexpression was reported to induce neural tissue in explants without inducing mesoderm  <cit> , and because fgf8a overexpression does not induce xbra expression in whole embryos . embryos were injected at the 1-cell stage, collected at stage  <dig> and assayed by rt-pcr. expression of soxd, sox <dig>  zicr <dig>  foxd5α and ngnr <dig> was enhanced by overexpression of noggin or fgf . however, expression of gem and sox <dig> was unchanged  indicating that bmp antagonism and fgf <dig> are not sufficient to enhance their expression at this stage.

to determine if fgf8a signaling is sufficient to activate or maintain the expression of the early neural genes, we analyzed their expression in gastrula  and neurula  stage ectodermal explants  in response to noggin, fgf8a and nog+fgf8a. genes expressed at high maternal levels  were not examined at stage  <dig> . as shown in prior studies, bmp inhibition induced the expression of neural progenitor markers  and the other early neural markers,  by st.  <dig>  at stage  <dig> , fgf8a induced zicr <dig>  foxd5α and sox <dig> expression and by stage  <dig> induced neuron formation; however, it also induced the expression of the pan-mesodermal marker xbra  and the dorsal mesoderm marker and bmp antagonist, noggin . therefore, it is possible that fgf8a alters neural gene expression indirectly via signals from the dorsal mesoderm.

explants from embryos co-injected with noggin and fgf8a are comprised of neural progenitors  and neurons   and have a distinct morphology; by stage  <dig>  they are ~ 2-fold larger than ui, noggin or fgf8a caps indicating either increased cell size or proliferation . to determine if the increase in explant size was due to increased proliferation, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect phosphorylated histone h <dig> , an indicator of mitosis. explants from embryos injected with nog and fgf8a mrna had an average of  <dig>  fold more proliferating cells per square millimeter than uninjected explants . to verify that the size difference was not due to the presence of large migratory neural crest cells with extended processes, we assayed for the expression of the neural crest marker, slug. these explants did not express slug , but did express the epidermal and mesodermal marker vent <dig>  the neuronal marker n-tub and the proliferating progenitor markers sox <dig>  sox <dig> and gem . one possible explanation for the mixed cell population in these large explants is that their fate varies with the level of noggin or fgf received.

ectoderm is competent to respond to bmp inhibition and fgf signaling prior to the onset of gastrulation
to determine when ectodermal cells are competent to respond to fgf8a signaling or bmp inhibition by noggin, we assayed for the expression of the early neural genes, zicr <dig>  foxd5a and sox <dig> prior to mbt  and until the onset of gastrulation and neural induction . embryos were injected with mrna coding for noggin, fgf8a or noggin+ fgf8a in  <dig> of 2-cells and collected at  <dig> hpf and every hour after until stage  <dig>  . we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization  and semi-quantitative rt-pcr to detect the expression of zicr <dig>  sox <dig> and foxd5α , which were expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf  in embryos and induced by both noggin and fgf8a by stage  <dig>  in ectodermal explants . endogenous expression of zicr <dig> was first detected by wish at  <dig> hpf  and by rt-pcr at  <dig> hpf. bmp inhibition by noggin enhanced expression of zicr <dig> at  <dig> hpf  and by a truncated bmpr  at  <dig> hpf . fgf8a also increased zicr <dig> expression by 8- <dig> hpf . low levels of zicr <dig> were detected at all stages tested, thus neither bmp inhibition nor fgf signalling induced expression prematurely. in contrast, foxd5α expression was induced by noggin and fgf8a by  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , respectively, whereas endogenous dorsal-specific expression was first detected at  <dig> hpf. sox <dig> expression was also induced prematurely at 8- <dig> hpf , and expanded by fgf8a, noggin and tbr at  <dig> hpf  . in summary, foxd5α and zicr <dig> are induced and expanded, respectively, in the ectoderm in response to bmp inhibition and fgf8a signalling by  <dig> hpf, whereas sox <dig> expression is not significantly altered in response to fgf8a signaling until much later after the onset of endogenous expression . these experiments indicate that early neural genes are induced by noggin by  <dig> hpf and respond to fgf8a at different times.

fgf signaling is required for the induction of sox <dig> and foxd5a expression
in xenopus, the induction of neural tissue occurs at the onset of gastrulation in response to bmp inhibition, and this induction may be dependent on instructive fgf signaling. to determine if bmp inhibition and/or fgf signaling are required for neural tissue formation, we analyzed the expression of the early neural genes in response to constitutively active bmp signaling and the loss of fgf signaling. in support of the neural default model, overexpression of a constitutively active bmp receptor  inhibited the expression of the six early neural genes at the onset of neural induction  and noggin expanded their expression , suggesting that the expression of all early neural genes requires bmp inhibition. in contrast, each of the early neural genes responded differently to loss of fgf signaling. to interfere with fgf signaling, we used dominant negative fgfr4a  because it is the receptor through which fgf <dig> stimulates neuron formation  <cit>  and was deemed more effective at blocking neural development than dominant negative fgfr <dig>   <cit> . surprisingly, although fgf8a induced soxd expression in explants, Δ4a overexpression had no effect on soxd expression in embryos . however, Δ4a expression inhibited sox <dig>  and foxd5a  expression and reduced zicr <dig> expression  at stage  <dig> , and sox <dig> and gem expression  at stage  <dig> . since fgf signaling inhibits bmp signaling via phosphorylation of smad <dig>  <cit> , we wanted to determine if the Δ4a phenotypes could be rescued by noggin, or in other words, were due to increased bmp signaling. zicr <dig>  sox <dig> and gem expression were rescued by overexpression of noggin  and therefore not dependent on fgf signaling. however, sox <dig> and foxd5a expression were not rescued by overexpression of noggin  indicating an independent role for fgf signaling. these data indicate that fgf signaling is required for the expression of sox <dig> and foxd5α.

we next tested whether fgf signaling through fgfr4a is required for the expression of early neural genes in explants in which bmp signaling is inhibited. we overexpressed Δ4a in ectodermal explants neuralized by noggin and performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr. as in embryos, fgf signaling was required for the expression of sox <dig> and foxd5α in neuralized mid-gastrula or neurula explants . although, zicr <dig> and soxd expression were reduced by Δ4a in noggin-injected stage  <dig>  embryos , their expression was greatly reduced or inhibited by Δ4a expression in noggin-injected explants . in fact, by neurula stage, the expression of all of the early neural genes was greatly reduced or lost in explants co-injected with noggin and Δ4a. xfd inhibited sox <dig> and foxd5a expression and by st.  <dig> also reduced soxd and gem expression. in summary, the explant rt-pcr data and wish embryo data  indicate that soxd, sox <dig>  zicr <dig> and foxd5α require fgf signaling for robust expression at the gastrula stage, whereas sox <dig> and gem require fgf signaling for the maintenance of their expression in explants after induction by bmp inhibition.

fgf8a induces neurons in the presence of bmp signaling and epidermis formation
fgf8a induces neural gene expression in explants  and expands their expression in embryos , and fgf signaling is required for the expression of the neural progenitor markers sox <dig> and foxd5α in the neural plate   <cit> . to determine if fgf induces early neural gene expression by repressing bmp signaling, we tested the effect of fgf8a on the expression of bmp, its targets, and epidermis formation. first, we determined the temporal expression of bmp target genes prior to and at the onset of neural induction in embryos . embryos were collected as for figure  <dig>  bmp <dig> expression was detectable by rt-pcr at  <dig> hpf, and was increased after the onset of zygotic transcription at  <dig> hpf . the direct target of bmp <dig>  vent <dig>  <cit> , was also expressed robustly at  <dig> hpf, and the expression of vent <dig>  a direct vent <dig> target  <cit> , followed at  <dig> hpf. msx- <dig>  a bmp target that is eventually restricted to the neural plate border, was first detected at  <dig> hpf and the definitive epidermal marker epi-k was not expressed in any stages prior to stage  <dig>  but is expressed at stage  <dig> .

to determine the effect of fgf signaling on bmp signaling and epidermal development, we injected mrna coding for noggin, fgf8a, or nog and fgf8a together, dissected ectodermal explants, cultured them until stage  <dig> and performed rt-pcr for markers of bmp signaling and epidermal development. in noggin-expressing explants, the expression of bmp <dig> and its targets were decreased significantly . in contrast, fgf8a enhanced the expression of bmp <dig>  bmp target gene expression and epidermal formation  even though it also induced neurons and mesoderm in explants . in embryos, overexpression of fgf8a inhibited vent <dig> expression at  <dig> hpf, but expression recovered one hour later . when fgf8a and noggin were injected together, the expression of all markers except vent <dig> was lost .

these data indicate that fgf signaling is required for the induction of both sox <dig> and foxd5α and for the continued expression of sox <dig> and gem . additionally, overexpression of fgf8a in explants leads to the expression of markers of neural progenitors, neurons and mesoderm and has no overt effect on epidermal development in embryos. to determine the fate of fgf8a- and nog/fgf8a -injected cells in embryos, we injected mrna coding for noggin, fgf8a, or noggin+fgf8a into  <dig> of  <dig> cell embryos, cultured the embryos until neurula stage, and performed wish for sox <dig> , foxd5α , ngnr- <dig> , n-tub , msx- <dig>  vent <dig> , and epi-k . overexpression of noggin or fgf8a expanded the neural progenitor marker, sox <dig>  and together, dramatically expanded its expression throughout the entire injected side . alone, neither noggin nor fgf8a affected the expression of foxd5α , but together increased foxd5α expression . noggin had no effect on proneural  or neuronal  gene expression whereas fgf8a  and nog+ fgf8a  induced ectopic expression of ngnr- <dig> and n-tub in lateral and ventral ectoderm . these data confirm previous observations that bmp inhibition is sufficient to induce neural progenitors, but only weakly induces the formation of neurons  <cit> . furthermore, fgf <dig> only weakly expands the neural progenitor population but greatly expands the population of neurons  <cit> . these data indicate that after induction of neural tissue by bmp antagonists, an additional signal is required to cue progenitors to differentiate into neurons. fgf8a effectively serves as this signal.

experiments in explants show that fgf8a does not induce the expression of neural genes by inhibiting bmp signaling . to determine if this is the case in embryos, we injected fgf8a with and without noggin and assayed for the expression of non-neural ectodermal markers. noggin repressed the expression of vent <dig>  and epi-k  and reduced but dispersed msx- <dig> expression  in neurula stage embryos. in contrast, even though fgf8a induced ectopic neurons in embryos, it did not repress the expression of non-neural ectodermal or differentiated epidermal markers . in fact, ectopic n-tub  expression overlapped with that of epi-k and ectopic msx- <dig> in the superficial ectodermal layer . with the addition of noggin, the ectopic neurons were excluded from the deep layer and did not overlap with epidermis, which is repressed by noggin .

in summary, fgf8a expands proneural, neuronal, and non-neural domains such that msx <dig>  n-tub and epi-k are expressed in the same cells but segregated from proliferating progenitors. noggin represses epidermal development to induce neural markers whereas fgf8a does not, suggesting that bmp antagonism and fgf signaling do not use the same mechanisms to induce the expression of neural genes.

discussion
the long-standing debate over the signals required for neural induction led us to investigate the requirements for the induction and maintenance of expression of the first five genes expressed in the neural plate, which we designate as early neural genes. we have determined that bmp inhibition is necessary but not sufficient for the onset of expression of all of the early neural genes. bmp inhibition is both necessary and sufficient to induce the expression of zicr <dig>  but expression of sox <dig> and foxd5α in the neural plate also requires signaling through fgfr4a. additionally, fgf8a signaling is sufficient to prematurely induce or expand expression of zicr <dig>  foxd5α and sox <dig> in unspecified ectoderm, and to expand the neural tube and induce ectopic neurons at later stages. however, fgf8a has no effect on epidermal development indicating that it does not exert its effect via bmp inhibition. our results add to the prior known roles of fgf signaling and bmp inhibition in neural gene expression by showing that they are involved in the expression of different early neural genes, and that they act independently of each other.

bmp signaling is sufficient to inhibit neural gene expression at the onset of neural induction
many studies have shown that inhibition of bmp signaling by antagonists such as chordin  <cit> , noggin  <cit>  and follistatin  <cit>  induces neural tissue. additionally, studies have shown that overexpression of known bmp targets such as msx- <dig>  <cit> , xvent <dig>  <cit>  and xvent <dig>  <cit>  ventralize xenopus embryos. although bmp signaling is known to repress neural development and induce epidermal genes  <cit> , studies have yet to show if bmp signaling inhibits the onset of expression of neural specification genes  in dorsal ectoderm or if the induction of their expression is dependent on other signals. we overexpressed a constitutively active bmp receptor  and showed that active bmp signaling repressed the onset of zygotic expression of sox <dig>  zicr <dig>  sox <dig>  gem, and foxd5α. cabmpr also repressed the expression of the neural inducer, soxd, by the end of gastrulation . since sox <dig> and gem are expressed pan-ectodermally until stage  <dig> , and thus initially overlap with bmp <dig> and vent <dig> expression, it is surprising that cabmpr repressed their expression. why aren't they repressed by bmp signaling in ventral cells in early gastrulae? one possibility is that repression requires both vent <dig> and vent <dig>  which are not expressed together until mid-gastrula stages unless prematurely activated by overexpression of cabmpr.

overexpression of fgf and bmp antagonists induce zicr <dig> and foxd5a expression prematurely
prior experiments led to the conclusion that bmp antagonism is not sufficient for the induction of neural tissue in chick epiblast or ventral ectoderm of frogs  <cit> . we argue that bmp inhibition is sufficient for the induction of some early neural genes in unspecified ectoderm. through our analysis of early neural gene expression, we find that the initiation of sox <dig> and foxd5α expression requires fgf signaling in addition to inhibition of bmp signalling. this supports the conclusions of previous studies that demonstrated that an fgf <dig> morpholino inhibited the expression of sox <dig> in ectoderm in response to the dominant negative r-smad, smad5-sbn  <cit> , but contradicts recent studies that demonstrated that fgf is only required for expression of sox <dig> in the circumblastoporal region  <cit> . however, we also show that noggin is sufficient to induce the expression of foxd5α prematurely in unspecified ectoderm indicating that fgf is present in the ectoderm at this time . this is in contrast to studies in:  chick embryos in which inhibition of bmp signaling is not sufficient to induce the expression of sox <dig> in non-neural tissue even in the presence of fgf <dig>  <cit>  and;  frog embryos in which bmp inhibition by overexpression of smad <dig> was insufficient to induce sox <dig> in ventral ectoderm unless tgf-β signaling was also inhibited  <cit>  or efgf added  <cit> . we argue that differences in developmental timing, tissue competence and experimental approaches may account for the different conclusions drawn. specifically, our experiments differ from past studies in that we assay for the expression of neural genes prior to and contemporaneous with neural ectoderm specification whereas previous studies tested the ability of bmp inhibition to convert the fate of epiblast or epidermal cells permanently by testing gene expression in later stage embryos. in past studies, it is possible that bmp inhibition allowed for transient expression of neural genes at the onset of neural induction, but this expression was not maintained and therefore not detected. our studies considered with these studies indicate that inhibition of bmp induces neural genes in unspecified ectoderm of early gastrula embryos but this induction is transient and a second signal such as a tgfβ inhibition  <cit>  or fgf signaling  <cit>  found only in dorsal ectoderm is required to maintain their expression.

fgf signaling is required for the induction of sox <dig> and foxd5a expression in the neural plate
fgf8a signaling is sufficient to expand sox <dig> expression and induce ectopic neurons in embryos . furthermore, fgf signaling is required for the expression of sox <dig> and foxd5α. these two genes are reported to be essential for the differentiation of neural ectoderm  <cit>  indicating that fgf signaling is also essential for neural development. the loss of expression of these genes is not rescued by antagonism of bmp signaling by noggin indicating that fgf signaling is instructive or permissive and does not induce sox <dig> or foxd5a expression by inhibiting bmp signaling. however, the requirements for fgf are different for other early neural genes. for example, although misexpression of dominant negative fgfr4a reduces zicr <dig> expression at st.  <dig> , this loss is rescued by noggin. therefore, fgf signaling induces zicr <dig> expression by either inhibiting bmp signaling  <cit> , or sensitizing the ectoderm to bmp inhibition. the latter hypothesis is supported by our in vivo experiments , which show that subsequent to fgf8a overexpression, the ectoderm is competent to express both neural and epidermal markers in the same tissue. contrary to this theory, recent studies in mouse embryonic stem cells suggest that unlike mfgf <dig>  which promotes stem-like renewal of multipotent epiblast cells, mfgf <dig> creates a population of specified transient neural progenitors  <cit> . however, in these studies the neural progenitors were unable to differentiate into neurons as do fgf8+ xenopus ectodermal cells  suggesting that xfgf8a has additional functions in development  <cit> .

sox <dig> and gem are unaffected by knock down of fgf signaling via Δ4a at early gastrula stages, but their expression is lost by the end of gastrulation indicating that although these genes do not require fgf signaling for induction, fgf is necessary for maintenance of their expression . this is supported by the loss of their expression in stage  <dig> but not stage  <dig>  explants in response to Δ4a. furthermore, sox <dig> directly activates the expression of gem  <cit> , and sox <dig> and geminin may both activate expression of themselves forgoing the necessity for an instructive signal such as fgf.

finally, soxd expression has different regulatory requirements than all of the other early neural genes. although it is induced by fgf8a overexpression in explants , knock down of fgf signaling via Δ4a has no effect on soxd expression in embryos  and past studies showed that knock down of fgf <dig> signaling also had no effect  <cit> . furthermore, soxd is induced by bmp inhibition   <cit> , but constitutive bmp signaling has no effect on the induction of soxd at stage  <dig> , only on its maintenance at stage  <dig> .

fgf8a induces and expands neural genes in the presence of mesoderm without inhibiting bmp signaling and epidermal development
bmp inhibition by misexpression of noggin predominantly induces neural progenitors at the expense of epidermis . in contrast, fgf8a overexpression induces the formation of neurons  without inhibiting epidermal formation , suggesting that fgf8a acts in a pathway independent of bmp inhibition to induce neural gene expression and neuron formation. however, induction of mesoderm by fgf8a is dependent on bmp signaling as it is blocked with the co-injection of noggin mrna.

fgf8a signaling induces the premature expression of neural genes in ectoderm and ectodermal explants in cells that are also expressing epidermal genes . although previous studies showed that the superficial layer of the ectoderm is less competent to respond to neuronal inducing signals  <cit> , we found that fgf8a induces n-tub positive neurons in both the superficial and deep ectodermal layers that overlap with epi-k expressing cells . one interpretation is that fgf8a maintains the competency of the superficial layer to undergo neurogenesis. it is also possible that fgf8a induces neurons without increasing the progenitor pool, but this is hard to envision without a loss of epidermal gene expression. another possibility is that fgf8a overexpression induces mosaic cell fates in explants based on the levels of protein bound by each cell. our data support the hypothesis that overexpression of fgf8a maintains cellular competence since the fgf <dig> injected cells form many tissue types indicated by markers of epidermis, neurons and neural progenitors.

CONCLUSIONS
in toto, this research shows that fgf signaling induces two early neural genes, sox <dig> and foxd5α, independent of epidermal development. these data refute prior studies because they show that both bmp inhibition and fgf signaling are sufficient to induce neural tissue as marked by early neural genes in xenopus ectoderm. finally, we have shown that the regulation of early neural genes is unique even within gene families  and therefore, conclusions about the requirement for fgf signaling in neural induction may be gene specific. although previous models for neural induction stated that either bmp inhibition was sufficient or fgf signaling was required for neural induction, here we show that in xenopus, there is no neural induction regulatory module that can explain the induction of all early neural genes; sox <dig> and foxd5α require fgf signaling for expression but sox <dig>  geminin and zicr <dig> do not.
