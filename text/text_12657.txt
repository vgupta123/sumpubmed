BACKGROUND
this study represents mtdna data regarding the population of saudi arabia. geographically, desert is the most prominent feature of the arabian peninsula, which comprises the modern countries of saudi arabia, yemen, oman, the united arab emirates, qatar, bahrain, and kuwait. saudi arabia occupies eighty percent of the arabian peninsula and is divided into five major regions – central, northern, southern, eastern and western. from the western coastal region , the land rises from sea level to a peninsula-long mountain range  beyond which are plateaus to the east. the southwestern 'asir region has mountains as high as  <dig>  metres  and is known for having the most hospitable climate in the country. the east is primarily rocky or sandy lowland continuing to the shores of the arabian gulf. although vast arid tracts dominate, stretches of coastline along the arabian gulf and the red sea and several major oases in the central and eastern regions have provided water necessary for human habitation. the coastal areas have been trading centers for centuries with resultant population diversity. in addition, for  <dig> years the haj has brought millions of muslims annually to the region between mecca and jeddah, some of whom have stayed for generations. traditionally, the central  region of the country has had more population stability. more than 95% of the population now is settled in population centers that are mainly located along the eastern and western coasts and near interior oases such as hofuf, buraydah, and riyadh.

the arabian peninsula is a region through which numerous migrations between africa and asia took place since ancient times. anthropological  <cit> , archaeological  <cit> , and genetic  <cit>  evidence has given support to the hypothesis that modern humans may have dispersed out of africa, following a southern route through the arabian peninsula before they pursued a levantine route  <cit> . according to this scenario, the arabian peninsula may have been the first step in the colonization of southern and eastern asia. middle palaeolithic artefacts discovered in southwestern areas of the arabian peninsula are similar to ones recovered in africa, providing support for the suggestion that the red sea coasts may have been important in this southern expansion  <cit> . the presence of obsidian lithics on the african and arabian sides of the red sea attests to neolithic contacts as well. archaeological evidence supports late neolithic levantine colonization of the arabian peninsula with successive population expansions and contractions depending on climatic conditions  <cit> .

the strategic position of the arabian peninsula made it a crucial area for trade, cultural exchange, and warfare after the emergence of old world western civilizations. mesopotamian states invaded the arabian peninsula from the north since prehistoric times  <cit> , ionic and roman-byzantine classic cultures took control of strategic trade routes in arabia, and the sassinid persians dominated southern arabia around  <dig> ad. influences from the african side were also present as pharanoiac egypt and the sudanese meroitic and abyssinian askumite kingdoms extended their borders well inside arabia  <cit> . arabian nabatean and sabean cultures exerted their influence in turn on the levant and ethiopia, although to a lesser degree. events changed dramatically with the rise of islam in arabia during the 7th century ad. in a short span of time, arabs built a military and cultural empire that extended from pakistan in the east to the iberian peninsula in the west. even more complete arabization occurred later in north africa with the bedouin hilalian invasion in the 11th century ad.

the impact of these migrations on the arab gene pool remains unclear because genetic information about the region has been scarce. arab populations  are distinct from other near east populations and from india and central asia in an analysis based on classical markers, suggesting the possibility of an ancient expansion from east africa  <cit> . early studies could not discriminate remote from recent contacts, but non-recombining uniparental markers have allowed more refined phylogeographic analysis at both continental  <cit>  and regional  <cit>  levels.

the rapid mutation rate of mitochondrial dna  and y-chromosome microsatellites permits estimates of lineage expansion age and of the most probable geographic origin of these expansions  <cit> . only two studies regarding the arabian peninsula have been based on mtdna. lineage classification of a small sample of  <dig> bedouins  <cit>  revealed that  <dig>  had a eurasian origin, two  belonged to the sub-saharan africa l <dig> and l <dig> haplogroups, and two were left undetermined. a study of  <dig> yemeni mtdnas showed that eurasian-specific and african-specific lineages existed in almost equal proportion in that southern arabian peninsula sample  <cit> .

in a sample of  <dig> saudi arabs, we sequenced the non-coding hvsi/ii mtdna regions and further characterized haplogroup diagnostic coding region positions by restriction fragment length polymorphism  or by partial sequencing in order to estimate the genetic structure of the arabian peninsula and to search for archaic n and/or m lineages such as those found in india, australia, and southern-east asia that trace a rapid human expansion outside africa. the comparison of this sample to  <dig>  classified sequences from the near east and  <dig> from east africa allowed us to estimate the relative gene flow between these areas and the arabian peninsula. we also provide a detailed mtdna phylogeny of haplogroup  <dig>  the most frequent and diverse haplogroup in the arabian peninsula. the analysis of this haplogroup, recently renamed r0a  <cit> , is based on complete sequences and a global phylogeographic analysis based on  <dig> hvsi sequences.

RESULTS
the total number of different haplotypes in our sample of  <dig> saudi arabs were  <dig>  when hvsi and ii variation and rflp were taken into account ; however, the k value dropped to 64% when only partial hvsi variation was used in comparison with other populations . some lineages had to be included into imprecise groups such as h/hv/r for haplotype and haplogroup frequency comparison, although all saudi haplotypes were completely sorted into their respective clades and sub-clades . the bulk of individuals  belonged to the eurasian macrohaplogroup n and its main r branch , while the sub-saharan africa macrohaplogroup l  and the asian macrohaplogroup m  accounted for a smaller proportion of haplotypes.

sub-saharan african macrohaplogroup l lineages
five of the eight saudi arabian l lineages belonged to different l <dig> sub-clusters. although l3d is a widespread african clade, the single saudi representative  had exact duplicates only in yemen and ethiopia  <cit> . l3f was the most frequent l <dig> cluster in yemen and ethiopia, and the sole saudi l3f sequence  matched an ethiopian sequence  <cit> . sequence  <dig> was peculiar because it belonged to the recently defined east africa haplogroup l3i  <cit>  yet lacked the  <dig> transition and included the 16318t transversion. the remaining two l <dig> sequences  had l3h designation. one of them  harboured 16192– <dig> transitions and presented the 16129-16223-16256a-16311- <dig> hvsi motif that was first reported in west africa  <cit> . the other  belonged to the subset of l3h sequences found in ethiopia  <cit>  and in tanzania  <cit>  that had the combined 16179– <dig> hvsi motif. this haplogroup was present in moderate frequency in ethiopians and yemenis  <cit>  but no matches existed between them and the saudi population. the three remaining saudi l haplotypes fell into the l <dig> macrohaplogroup. one of the sequences  belonged to the western l2c clade and had matches in west africa guineans  <cit>  and in mozambique  <cit> . the last two l <dig> saudi sequences  fell into the widespread l2a cluster  <cit>  and had matches in east africa and yemen.

in general the sub-saharan africa maternal gene flow to saudi arabia was moderate  and fell into the range found for other arab populations in the near east  <cit> . a small portion of this sub-saharan africa genetic input could be due to contacts with yemeni communities from southern arabia, but the most characteristic yemeni l <dig> clade  <cit>  was not present in the saudi sample.

macrohaplogroup m
five of the eight m saudi arab lineages clustered into the m <dig> african haplogroup  <cit> . three of them had the  <dig> transition that was diagnostic of the m1a east african cluster, and the remaining one belonged to the rare but widespread m1b <dig> cluster characterized in the hvsi region by  <dig> transition and the 16190d deletion that had been identified in the northwest africa, jordan, and the iberian peninsula  <cit> . the other three m sequences belonged to indian clades. one had the basic motif  of the m <dig> haplogroup  <cit> . a second had the  <dig> and  <dig> transitions that defined haplogroup m <dig>  <cit> , although this sequence  did not match any of the definite or putative m <dig> sequences found in india  <cit>  or pakistan  <cit> .

the last m sequence  has been found with the central motif in bhoksa from uttar pradesh  <cit>  and with the central motif and the  <dig> transition in two derivatives in yerava from south india  <cit> . because these lineages were pooled as undetermined m*, we completely sequenced our sample  and compared it to  <dig> complete indian m sequences  <cit>  to know its phylogenetic position. our ar <dig> sequence shared only transition  <dig> with the basal mutations that defined haplogroup m <dig>  <cit>  so that the most parsimonious tree clustered it with this haplogroup . however, we think that ar <dig> may be representative of a new indian branch of macrohaplogroup m because  <dig> is a highly recurrent mutation that has independently appeared in the tips  and sub-cluster roots  of other m haplogroups. the m contributions to the saudi arab gene pool represented gene flow from east and north africa  and india  but not from central asia.

macrohaplogroup n
all the main western eurasian branches of n  were present in saudi arabia, with the least common ones  having an infrequent presence in saudi arabs . n1a was the only one of these haplogroups that seemed to have a consistent presence across the arabian peninsula because it was also moderately frequent  and diverse  in yemeni  <cit> . n1a frequency dropped to 4% in saudi arabs, where it harboured only two different haplotypes. the most abundant one, with the 16147a-16172-16218-16223-16248-16261-16274- <dig> hvsi motif and the 41-73-199- <dig> hvsii motif, had not been observed in the near east or in east africa, and the second  was only shared with ethiopians.

saudi arabs had the main european and western asian haplogroups  included in r, the main branch of n, albeit in different frequencies. haplogroup h was the most frequent cluster in european  and near east  populations  <cit>  but only accounted for 13% of saudi lineages, comparable to the frequency in bedouin and yemeni. h frequencies significantly diminished with latitude from turkey to yemen through the levant .

haplogroups k  and t  had similar frequencies in saudi arabs to those found in europe and the near east  <cit> . however, the subgroup composition of haplogroup u clearly differed from europe in saudi arabia and in other near eastern regions. the most prevalent haplogroup in europe  was represented in saudi arabs by only one u5a1a derived lineage . likewise, the north-african u <dig> haplogroup  <cit>  is represented by only one lineage . several minority european u sub-clades  may have had their origins in the near east  <cit> . all of them had representative lineages in saudi arabs except for u <dig>  u <dig>  which were also absent from bedouin of the negev desert, and yemeni samples .

the rare haplogroup u <dig> was present in our sample with a frequency of 3% . this haplogroup was first defined by rflp- <dig> haeiii and observed only in south pakistan  <cit> . it was later proven to be a sister branch of haplogroup u <dig>  <cit>  on the basis of two complete u <dig> sequences , both of which shared the 499– <dig> motif. in addition to  <dig>  transitions at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> defined the basal motif of u <dig>  the ethiopian sequence was considered representative of sub-cluster u9a and the pakistani sequence as representative of sub-cluster u9b. the three saudi u <dig> sequences belonged to u9a because all of them shared the hvsi 16051– <dig> motif with the ethiopian sequence while none of them shared any hvsi or hvsii mutations with the u9b pakistani sequence . these three u9a sequences may be different occurrences of an old implantation of this haplogroup in the arabian peninsula.

a feature that differentiated near eastern populations from european and west asian populations was the high frequency of haplogroups j and  <dig>  <cit> , and this was also true for saudi arabia. j haplotypes represented 25% of the saudi sample, and its main contributor was the j1b cluster . saudi and bedouin samples showed an identical trend in this respect and were different from yemenis, whose j1b frequency  was similar to other near eastern samples . the j1b frequency in the arabian peninsula was significantly higher than in the rest of the near east, even when yemenis were included . however, j1b in arabia displayed a low level of haplotypic diversity in spite of its relative abundance . unlike the derived j1b <dig> lineage, j1b was scarce in north africa  <cit>  and practically absent in europe  <cit>  except for italy  <cit> .

haplogroup  <dig> was even more frequent than j1b in saudi arabs . the frequency of this sequence in saudi arabs was not significantly different from that observed in yemeni jews  and bedouins of the negev desert , but it dropped to  <dig> % in yemenis  <cit>  . like j1b, the  <dig> frequency in the arabian peninsula was significantly higher than in the rest of the near east .

phylogeny of haplogroup  <dig> based on complete mtdna sequences
the relative abundance and diversity of  <dig> in the saudi sample permitted more detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses of this haplogroup. the phylogenetic tree based on  <dig> complete mtdna  <dig> sequences  confirmed that the basic motif of this group harboured the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transitions  <cit> . in addition, the transition at  <dig> was a basic diagnostic mutation for this haplogroup. three main branches sprouted from this trunk. 1a was characterized by a transition at  <dig>  while 1b was defined by the 57i-2355- <dig> motif. the  <dig> transition was already documented as a defining mutation of a group of  <dig> sequences comprising one druze, one eritrean, four ethiopian jews, and two yemeni jews  <cit> . 1c was a potential third branch that can be diagnosed by the  <dig> transition because this mutation was shared by the eu <dig> sequence  and a partial sequence from a moroccan jew  <cit> . the saudi arab sequences  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  constitute a 1a <dig> sub-branch within 1a, defined by transitions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we excluded  <dig> and  <dig> as diagnostic positions because  <dig> was a highly mutable site and because the  <dig> change was recurrent within  <dig> . a 1b <dig> sub-cluster was defined by sequences ip <dig> and ert <dig> that shared the  <dig> transition. we estimated a radiation age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years for the entire  <dig> haplogroup. the 1a branch, with an age of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years, is somewhat younger than the 1b branch .

phylogeography of haplogroup 1
in addition, several minority clusters provided valuable information. for instance, the one defined by  <dig> was formed exclusively by east african sequences. the one identified by  <dig> loss or by  <dig> was centrally composed of pakistani and iranian sequences and had a derivative yemeni sequence which pointed to some maternal gene flow to yemen from those areas. the same could be said of the  <dig> branch, although the gene flow was from ethiopia to saudi arabia in this case. ethiopia seemed to have been a secondary center of  <dig> expansions to the near east, arabian peninsula, and northwest africa, as could be deduced from branches defined by  <dig> and the motif 16168– <dig>  given the peripheral position of saudi haplotypes, saudi arabia seemed to have acted more as receiver than a focus of  <dig> expansions with the exception of the  <dig> clade. radiation ages for the whole  <dig> haplogroup based on hvsi sequences were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years;  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years for the  <dig> 1a1) sub-clade, and more recent for the  <dig> subclade.

population comparisons
we first performed amova using haplogroup and haplotypic frequencies in order to assess the degree of homogeneity within and between the different geographic areas. as customary, the bulk of the variation was found within populations . variance distribution for haplogroups was greater among groups than among populations , while variance distribution for haplotypes was less among groups than among populations . differences were highly significant in all cases .

pair-wise fst distances based on haplotype frequencies  showed that comparatively high heterogeneity within areas was due to the druze sample that was significantly different from all the other populations, mainly because of a high frequency of haplotypes  belonging to the minority haplogroup x and to k . the druze sample was a clear outlier in a graphic representation based on fst distances , separating from the remaining populations along the first dimension. founder effects or sample bias were the most likely causes of this deviation, as only two x <dig> and x <dig> haplotypes  <cit>  accounted for the x percentage. in addition, druze had the lowest diversity indices of all studied populations . the second dimension of this haplotype analysis included the arabian samples with those of east africa, while egyptians were aligned in the cluster of near east populations.

a somewhat different picture appeared after pc analysis based on haplogroup frequencies . in this graph, the druze were not outliers, most probably due to the fact that its variation is not correlated with that in other populations and therefore not reflected by the two first components. the first component separated all the near east populations from a cluster including egyptians and other east african groups. the majority of l haplogroups, pulling positively, and haplogroup h, pulling negatively, were predominantly responsible for this split. the second component divided the near east cluster into three groups. the first comprised northeastern populations characterized by higher frequencies of h haplogroups and absence of l haplogroups. the second combined the levantine population with egypt, and the three arabian peninsula samples were left in a third group. the major determinants of the arabian peninsula singularity were the comparatively high frequency of  <dig>  j1b, t <dig> and m <dig> haplogroups and the population specificity for other haplogroups such as l <dig>  l <dig>  u <dig> or u6b. this result was similar to that obtained using classical markers  <cit> . saudi and bedouin samples were relatively homogenous; however, the arabian peninsula as a whole was not homogenous because yemenis were differentiated by a greater african component.

discussion
mtdna genetic analysis of this saudi arabian group revealed almost exclusively contributions from africa and the near east. all saudi l, m and n lineages were derived from clades with roots in africa and west and south asia. the l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> haplogroups recently found in ethiopia and/or yemen  <cit>  were not detected in the saudi population. half of the sub-saharan african saudi lineages had exact matches in ethiopians and/or yemeni, pointing to these areas as the most likely source. the other half belonged to haplogroups with an east africa origin or that reached the red sea in their eastern radiation  <cit> . the arab slave trade and the expansion of empires from the sudan and ethiopia  <cit>  could explain this moderate sub-saharan africa maternal contribution to the present saudi arabian gene pool.

the majority of m <dig> lineages in saudi arabia belonged to the eastern africa m1a sub-clade that is particularly frequent and diverse in ethiopia  <cit> . ethiopia was again the most likely source. however, the sole m1b <dig> saudi sequence probably reached the arabian peninsula from northwest africa through the levantine corridor because this sequence has been reported repeatedly in west africa, the iberian peninsula, and jordan  <cit> , but not yet in ethiopia. based on y-chromosome studies, this northern route was proposed as an important path for bidirectional human migration between north africa and the levant  <cit> . the remaining m lineages detected in saudi arabs had a clear indian provenance. the basic saudi m <dig> lineage out of india was shared by yemenis and iranians. relatively recent contacts between india and the arabian peninsula by continental routes through iran or by indian ocean maritime routes could be responsible of this indian gene flow.

the overwhelming majority of n lineages present in saudi arabia had a clear western asia provenance. giving priority to geographically closest neighbors, 47% of the n lineages in saudi arabs were shared with other arabian peninsula neighbors , 31% with levantine populations, 16% with the anatolian-caucasus region, and only 6% with eastern africa. these data revealed only a modest backflow of eurasian lineages from africa to the arabian peninsula. the close affinity found among arabian peninsula populations was due mainly to sharing eurasian haplotypes and to similar eurasian haplogroup frequencies and not to the sub-saharan african contribution that is prominent in the yemeni population.

the high frequency of  <dig> in saudi arabians was not significantly different from that found in bedouin  <cit>  and in yemeni jews . however, this  <dig> frequency is significantly different of the non-jewish yemeni population  <cit>  and may reflect strong genetic drift in the founding population of yemeni jews. the frequencies of l  and j  lineages deduced from published sequences of yemeni jews  <cit>  were also similar to bedouin from negev desert and saudi frequencies. in general, jewish communities have evidenced strong maternal founder effects  <cit> . however, they usually harbor chromosome y and mtdna lineages that permit their most probable origin to be traced to the near east because they share the most common haplotypes with those populations  <cit> .

the majority of western asia lineages found in the arabian peninsula had original paleolithic and neolithic expansions in the near east  <cit>  or in caucasian and caspian regions  <cit> . most probably, these expansions reached the arabian peninsula as secondary waves when climatic conditions there or cultural improvements such as herding allowed colonization. the arabian peninsula has had a relatively low population density, and substantial demographic backflow to the near east is improbable. however, as for m <dig>  minor n north-african influences have been detected by the presence of an u <dig> lineage in our saudi sample. it has been suggested that the rare u <dig> clade might be another interesting exception because it has been detected only in pakistan  <cit> , ethiopia, and yemen  <cit> , and now in our saudi sample. u <dig> occurs frequently only among the makrani population in pakistan, which is characterized by a large component of sub-saharan african lineages, suggesting that u <dig> lineages in pakistan might also have an african origin  <cit> . makrani sub-saharan africa lineages have exact matches in africa, which is compatible with a recent conection as the result of the east african slave trade  <cit> . however, the entire sequenced ethiopian and pakistani u <dig> lineages  <cit>  are separated by a mean of  <dig>  coding mutations from the common root, placing the split at paleolithic times. most probably, ethiopia received its u <dig> lineages from the arabian peninsula that, in turn, received them from northern areas. the southern geographic distribution of u <dig> contrasts with the west-northern distribution u <dig>  of its sister clade  <cit> , but this is a pattern shared with other paleolithic u radiations such as u <dig>  u <dig>  <cit> , or u <dig>  <cit>  that have eastern and western branches. an original area west to india and east to the capsian sea would be an equidistant point to conciliate these early u radiations  <cit> .

it is difficult to differentiate successive gene flows or expansions at a population level because the most recent migration could carry both early and derivative lineages. however, the refined phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis carried out for haplogroup  <dig> allows some inferences regarding arabian peninsula population history. the coalescence age for the entire  <dig> haplogroup was estimated at around  <dig>  years ago, which is coincident with the beginning of the last ice age recession. however, in light of the peripheral distribution of the arabian lineages in the phylogenetic tree , arabian peninsula populations most likely did not actively participate in this paleolithic expansion. the subsequent radiation of the 1a <dig> clade occurred around  <dig>  years ago, a date that marks the transition from mesolithic to neolithic in the near east. the ancestral core of this cluster was defined mainly by near eastern lineages with important arabian and ethiopian participation. finally, a third detectable expansion involving lineages carrying the  <dig> transition seemed to be largely restricted to the arabian peninsula. its coalescence age, most probably placed it in a period of empires flourishing in northern arabia and on both shores of the red sea. the lack of archaic n and/or m autochthonous lineages in the arabian peninsula do not offer support for the proposed southern route of homo sapiens sapiens outside africa. nevertheless, these ancient lineages may become apparent in larger samples.

CONCLUSIONS
the majority of saudi-arab mitochondrial dna lineages  have a western asia provenance. all of the main western asia haplogroups were detected in the saudi sample, including the rare u <dig> clade. the african contribution totalled 12%, with the sub-saharan africa  contribution, represented by l macrohaplogroup, being only slightly higher than the m <dig> and u <dig> specific north-african contribution . a small indian influence  was also detected; however, no archaic n and/or m autochthonous lineages in the arabian peninsula were found. although the still large confidence intervals, the coalescence and phylogeography of  <dig> haplogroup  matches a neolithic expansion in saudi arabia.
