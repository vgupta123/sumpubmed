BACKGROUND
in angiosperms, the endosperm of the developing seeds is formed as a result of the double fertilization event. fertilization of the egg cell by a sperm cell from the male gametophyte generates the diploid embryo from which the tissues, organs, and shoot meristems of the plant will be generated. fertilization of the adjacent central cell by a second sperm cell forms a triploid endosperm which supports embryo growth and development by producing storage proteins, lipids and starch  <cit> . during this process, a large number of genes are activated. epigenetic regulatory considerations become important in relation to which parental allele will be expressed and in which reproductive tissue, a factor that ultimately governs among other things the size of the endosperm  <cit> .

developmental transition of plants from the vegetative to the reproductive stage and from the floral stage to the seed stage relies on the activity of mads-box transcription factors. with the completion of the arabidopsis genome, more than  <dig> genes encoding for mads-box transcription factors were uncovered which can be phylogenetically classified in five clades, termed mikc, mα, mβ, mγ and mδ   <cit> . the mα, mβ, mγ subfamilies comprise the type i lineage, whereas the mikc and mδ constitute the type ii lineage. similarly, phylogenetic analysis based on the completed rice genome revealed  <dig> type ii mads-box genes, of the mikc and mδ clades, and  <dig> type i mads-box genes of the mα, mβ, mγ clades  <cit> . the two lineages are proposed to have arisen by a gene duplication that took place in the common eukaryotic ancestor more than a billion years ago  <cit> . mikc genes harbor the characteristic mads-box domain , the intervening domain , the keratin-like domain  and the c-terminal domain . in contrast, the type i genes contain only the mads-box domain . although the type i genes represent about 60% of the total mads genes in arabidopsis, they have only recently started to be studied, whereas the type ii genes have been extensively investigated both structurally and functionally  <cit> . this is due mostly to the fact that type i mads genes function during early gametogenesis, embryogenesis and seed formation and consequently homozygous mutants are lethal. in addition their expression is very low during these developmental stages  <cit> . among the few type i family members that have been studied is pheres  <dig>  , a mγ-type gene with an important role in arabidopsis gamete and seed development  <cit> . epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been implicated in the transcriptional control of this gene. the phe <dig> gene is expressed transiently at high levels immediately after fertilization in a parentally imprinted manner where the paternal allele is expressed whereas the maternal allele is silenced  <cit> . both dna and histone methylation are responsible for these silencing events  <cit> . the prc <dig> polycomb group complex is partially responsible for keeping the maternal allele silent in the female gametophyte and in the seed after fertilization  <cit> . this is achieved through the histone methylation activity of the prc <dig> complex, conferred by one of its subunits, the histone methyltransferase medea  with histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation activity . the prc <dig> complex also restricts the expression of phe <dig> to the chalazal domain of the endosperm after fertilization. arabidopsis mea mutants show upregulated phe <dig> expression and form defective seed-like structures before fertilization and endosperm overproliferation after fertilization  <cit> . furthermore, a distantly located region downstream of paternal phe <dig> was found to have a dna methylation requirement for phe <dig> expression  <cit> .

additional type i mads-box genes have been implicated in gamete and seed development. the agamous-like <dig>  gene was found to regulate female gametophyte formation and normal embryo development  <cit> . agamous-like  <dig>  was shown to be critical for central cell and endosperm development in arabidopsis  <cit> . in agl <dig> mutants the formation of the central cell is defective, and endosperm development fails to initiate after fertilization. similarly, agamous-like  <dig>  also termed diana, plays an important role in central cell and endosperm formation, in arabidopsis  <cit> . like agl <dig>  agl <dig> mutants have aberrant central cell morphology which degenerates before fertilization occurs, and endosperm development does not take place post fertilization  <cit> . both genes are expressed exclusively in the central cell and early endosperm and this along with their similar mutant phenotype suggests that agl <dig> and agl <dig> proteins may function as heterodimers within the central cell. in agreement to this, agl <dig> and agl <dig> proteins were found to interact in yeast two-hybrid assays  <cit> . of equal interest is agl <dig> with high expression in the early nuclear endosperm and sharp decline right before cellularization  <cit> . in agl <dig> mutants, the endosperm cellularizes prematurely indicating that the agl <dig> is required for repression of precocious cellularization during the syncytial phase. agl <dig> is under the epigenetic control of prc <dig> genes, as in prc <dig> mutants agl <dig> fails to become silent and endosperm cellularization is arrested  <cit> . thus, agl <dig> seems to regulate the timing of endosperm cellularization, which is triggered epigenetically by prc2-mediated agl <dig> silencing. likewise, a recent study on agl <dig> demonstrated that the expression of the agl <dig> maternal allele is epigenetically controlled in a sequential manner, firstly upregulated by the function of demeter , a dna glycosylase enzyme responsible for demethylating medea, and then downregulated during endosperm development by the prc <dig> complex  <cit> . understanding the genetic and epigenetic processes controlling the timing of endosperm cellularization could be of particular interest in agriculture, as premature or delayed cellularization is associated with small and large seed size and weight, respectively.

an extensive genome-wide study of  <dig> type i mads-box genes in arabidopsis uncovered a cell-type-specific expression pattern during female gametophyte and early endosperm development  <cit> . most genes are expressed in the central cell and antipodal cells in the female gametophyte and in the chalazal and peripheral endosperm of 1–2 days after fertilization  developing seeds. these data are in agreement with the results from earlier functional studies of individual genes like phe <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig> and propose a role for type i mads-box genes in female gametophyte and endosperm development.

considerably less is known about type i mads-box genes in other plant species, especially monocots. in wheat,  <dig> mads-box genes were identified in silico, of which  <dig> were classified as type i <cit> . in rice, a global-scale microarray expression analysis identified an expression pattern for all type ii and type i mads-box genes during vegetative and reproductive development  <cit> . overall type i mads-box genes had lower expression levels than type ii mads-box genes. certain type i genes were expressed throughout development, whereas others exhibited more specific expression in particular tissues. for example, four rice type i genes, of the subclass mα, were found predominately expressed in seeds 5–20 days after fertilization suggesting a role for these genes in seed development. recently, a rice type i mads-box gene, osmads <dig>  was reported to be maternally expressed in rice endosperm and associated to endosperm developmental transitions caused by interspecific hybridization  <cit> .

cereal crops account for about 50% of global human calorific intake with the endosperm of cereal seeds being one of the most important sources . chief among these monocots are barley, wheat, rice and maize. besides human nutrition, cereal crops also represent major sources of feedstock, fiber and recently biofuel substrates. contrary to arabidopsis and other dicots where the endosperm is consumed during seed development, in monocots, such as barley and other cereals, the endosperm persists and constitutes the nutritional part of the seed containing storage proteins and starch.

considering the implications of type i mads-box genes on seed development and the agronomic importance of cereal endosperm, we set out to identify and characterize type i mads-box genes in barley. at least three of the arabidopsis type i mads-box genes, phe <dig>  agl <dig>  and agl <dig> are under epigenetic regulation mediated, in part, by the chromatin repressive enzymatic complex prc <dig>  our group has recently characterized barley genes encoding a putative prc <dig> polycomb group complex  <cit> . to further focus our research efforts in this area and study potential barley targets of a prc <dig> complex, we report here the identification and structural characterization of two barley type i-like mads-box genes. their expression has been studied in different tissues and seed developmental stages, in two cultivars with varying seed size, and after exogenous application of the developmental- and stress-related phytohormone aba. in addition, their genomic organization was examined and compared to their cereal homologues. finally, the 5’upstream regions were analyzed for conserved cis regulatory elements and the dna methylation patterns of upstream and downstream regions were investigated in two tissues with differential type i-like mads-box gene expression.

methods
plant material
commercial barley cultivars, caresse, byzantio, and ippolytos differing in seed size and weight were planted in the field and were the source of total rna for expression analysis. for caresse, the weight of  <dig> grains is 50– <dig> gr, and 98% of seeds have diameter longer than  <dig>  mm, for byzantio the weight of  <dig> grains is 36– <dig> gr and 75% of seeds have diameter longer than  <dig>  mm, whereas for ippolytos, seeds weight 25– <dig> gr per  <dig> grains and only 35–45% of seeds have diameter longer than  <dig>  mm .

hormonal treatment
seven-day-old seedlings  grown in a growth chamber  light, 8 h darkness, at 22°c) were sprayed with 100 μm aba,  and 100 μm ja . aerial parts of plants were collected at 6 h and 24 h after treatment and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen. aerial parts from five plants were pooled together for rna extraction for each time point. control plants were sprayed with water plus  <dig> % tween.

rna isolation and first strand cdna synthesis
total rna was isolated from roots, shoots, apical meristems, first leaves of seedlings, flowers before fertilization , seeds 1– <dig>  3– <dig>  5– <dig>  10– <dig>  15– <dig> days after fertilization , and aerial parts after hormonal treatments, respectively, using tri reagent  according to the instructions of the manufacturer. first strand cdna synthesis was performed using  <dig>  μg total rna,  <dig>  μg 3’ race adapter primer, 5’-ggccacgcgtcgactagtac 17-3’ , 1 mm dntps and 200u of superscript ii  in  <dig> μl total volume, according to the specifications of the manufacturer.

protein sequence analysis
 <dig> viridiplantae proteins sequences from uniprot with a statistically significant hit for the mads-box domain  were collected from the pfam database  <cit> . after sequence fragments were filtered out, the resulting set was the subject of an all-against-all similarity detection step using the blast algorithm. we used the bidirectional best hit approach  <cit>  for discovering putative orthologous proteins; we also asked for any orthologous sequence to be one of at least twenty sequences with the mads-box domain from the corresponding species, so that we reduce the chance of best hits due to lack of sequence context. the multiple alignment was created with mafft  <cit>  and edited with jalview version  <dig>   <cit>  after which the phylogenetic tree was constructed in the same software with the neighbor joining method using a blosum62-based distance measure. the phylogenetic tree was calculated using mega  <dig>  software  <cit>  by the neighbor-joining method with p-distance correction  <cit> . bootstrap values were obtained from  <dig> bootstrap replicates. accession numbers for sequences used for alignments and phylogenetic analysis are indicated in table  <dig> 

genomic organization
the genomic sequences of brachypodium distachyon _bradi2g <dig>  brachypodium distachyon_ bradi2g <dig>  oryza sativa_osmads65_q9xj <dig> , and zea mays_zmmads1_grmzm2g171650_b4fml <dig>  were downloaded from the phytozome database . the sequences of the two full length barley type-like mads-box ests were used to interrogate the barley database http://webblast.ipk-gatersleben.de/barley/index.php for detection of genomic sequences. genomic organization of exons and introns was obtained using the mrna-to-genomic alignment spidey tool, in ncbi . detection of retroelements was performed with the masive and ltrharvester tools   and homology was visualized with circoletto , all three tools developed in-house at ina, by the bioinformatics analysis team .

mapping in silico
an in silico visual comparative analysis was performed against the barley, opa  <dig>  consensus-hordeum-opa-2009-3 h  <cit> , the barley, opa123- <dig>  consensus-hordeum-opa123-2008-3 h and the barley, owb, opa2008-hordeum-owb-opa2008-3 h  <cit>  using the harvest tool and the comparative map viewer  available at gramene .

expression analysis of barley type i-like mads-box genes
qualitative rt-pcr and quantitative real-time rt-pcr was performed with cdna synthesized from 1 μg of total rna from roots, stems, meristems, leaves, immature flowers, seeds 1– <dig> daf, 3– <dig> daf, 5– <dig> daf, 10– <dig> daf and 15– <dig> daf and aerial parts of seedlings after aba and ja treatment. for real-time pcr, each sample reaction was set up in a pcr reaction mix  containing 5 μl of the 1: <dig> diluted cdna,  <dig>  μm of each primer and 1x platinum sybr green qpcr supermix-udg  and using the corbett rotor gene  <dig>  each reaction was performed in triplicates. general thermocycler conditions were 50°c for 2 min, 95°c for 2 min, then 42 cycles of 95°c for 15 sec, annealing [53°c for hvos <dig> and 57°c for hvos <dig> for 20 sec, extension 72°c for 20 sec, then 72°c for 5 min. to identify the pcr products a melting curve was performed from 65°c to 95°c with observations every  <dig> °c and a 10-s hold between observations. relative quantification was performed using actin as the reference gene and hvactinf / hvactinr as primers. the barley genes hva <dig> and hvadc  which are known to be induced by aba and ja, respectively  <cit> , were used as positive controls. all primers used in expression analysis correspond to non-conserved regions and are shown in .

in situ hybridization
in situ hybridization experiments were performed as it has been described previously  <cit> . briefly, seeds were fixed in 4%  paraformaldehyde supplemented with  <dig> %  glutaraldehyde in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer  for 4 h in a vacuum aspirator. fixed tissues were block-stained in  <dig> %  safranin, dehydrated through ethanol series, embedded in paraffin and cut into 8 mm-thin sections. antisense rna probes labelled with digoxigenin-11-rutp  were originated from pcr-generated templates incorporating t <dig> polymerase sites. the probe was designed close to the 3’-utr of the gene and its length was 202 bp. sections were prepared for hybridization as described before  <cit>  and hybridized overnight at 42°c in 50%  formamide, 300 mm nacl, 10 mm tris–hcl ph  <dig> , 1 mm edta,  <dig> %  ficoll,  <dig> %  polyvinylpyrrolidone,  <dig> %  bovine serum albumin , 10%  dextran sulfate and 60 mm dtt. after hybridization, the sections were treated with a solution containing 500 mm nacl, 1 mm edta, 10 mm tris–hcl and 50 μg/ml rnase a. finally, sections were washed several times in a 2xssc solution. hybridization signals were visualized with anti-digoxigenin antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. images were processed using photoshop  <dig> software .

genome walking and 5’ upstream sequence analysis
genome walking experiments were conducted on leaf genomic dna obtained from the barley caresse cultivar. the clontech genome walking kit was used and procedures were conducted according to manufacturer’s specifications. sequence information was obtained by doing three progressive rounds of genome walking using est sequence data as starting points. statistically significant prediction for cpg islands was performed using the online predictor, which is part of the sequence manipulation suite at http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/index.html. the prediction of the putative cis acting elements was accomplished using the tssp /prediction of plant promoters algorithm  in the softberry database  and plantcare . the position of the putative 5’ upstream regulatory elements is indicated according to the start codon .

dna methylation assays
genomic dna was prepared from immature flowers and from 1– <dig> daf seeds  with qiagen columns following the protocol of the manufacturer . cytosine dna methylation was analyzed by restricting 1 μg of genomic dna from each sample with the methylation-dependent enzyme mcrbc , according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and pcr-amplifying equal quantities of mcrbc-treated and untreated samples. primers used are shown in .

RESULTS
identification of type i-like mads-box genes in barley and protein sequence analyses
initial efforts to identify orthologues of type i mads-box genes in barley est databases via blast and other sequence similarity-based approaches failed to result in significant hits. additional efforts using degenerate primers designed using arabidopsis sequence data and barley cdna from multiple cultivars did not result in target gene isolation either . hence a more rigorous bioinformatics approach was employed and a monocot-specific c-terminus probe was generated using existing sequence data for mads-box putative proteins. the sequence of this probe was the following:

gagxxvngxoxxxnxdxxxxooqxxlkeiaxwxxqnnaoxxdanolekleolltoalrntkxkkmlxoonxg, where x is any amino acid and o is a possible gap. this probe was used to isolate several cereal type i-like mads-box sequences from available est databases and the genbank non-redundant cds translated database. of particular interest were two hits from the barley est database, chosen based on the presence of a mads-box domain and the absence of a k-domain, characteristic of type i mads-box proteins. these candidates were: bg <dig> and tc <dig>  . during the course of our investigations another study characterizing these sequences with respect to their role in the vernalization process was reported  <cit> . these authors designated these sequences as oddsoc <dig> and oddsoc <dig>  respectively. in our recent study on the identification and characterization of two soc1-like gene homologues from barley  <cit>  it was shown that two hvsoc1-like proteins containing the k-box domain are closely related to the type ii mads-box proteins whereas they are more distantly related to oddsoc <dig> and oddsoc <dig>  however, since greenup et al.   <cit>  were the first to report these genes we will utilize the nomenclature introduced by these authors and hereafter will be referring to the sequences bg <dig> and tc <dig> as hvos <dig> and hvos <dig>  respectively.

hvos <dig> is composed of  <dig> nt encoding a putative protein of  <dig> aa, and harboring a 5’utr of  <dig> nt and a 3’utr of  <dig> nt. hvos <dig> is composed of  <dig> nt encoding a putative protein of  <dig> aa, and containing a 5’utr of  <dig> nt, and a 3’utr of  <dig> nt. an alignment of mads-box proteins  from different plants is shown in figure  <dig>  the two barley putative protein sequences hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> show high similarity to the wheat sequences that have been previously classified as type i mads-box sequences  <cit> . hvos <dig> has 96% identity with the wheat taagl- <dig> sequence and hvos <dig> shares 92% identity with the wheat taagl- <dig> sequence. hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> putative protein sequences share  <dig> % identity with each other. in type ii mads-box proteins the characteristic three subdomains of the k-region, k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> are evident as shown in figure  <dig>  the barley hvos <dig> and hvos <dig>  wheat taagl- <dig> and taagl- <dig>  as well as their closest relatives rice osmads <dig> and maize zmb4fml <dig> harbor no regions with similarity to k regions, as expected for type i mads-box proteins. a separate alignment of the barley hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> and different type i mads-box sequences was constructed for more clarity . most of the similarity between the barley hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> and the other type i mads-box sequences is concentrated in the mads-box domain , whereas the rest of the sequences show a large degree of divergence. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a large number of mads-box proteins from different plants . three of the subclasses of type i, mα, mβ and mγ, are shown grouping out into separate clades. the barley hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> putative proteins, and their putative cereal orthologues, namely, wheat taagl- <dig> and taagl- <dig>  brachypodium bradi2g <dig> and bradi2g <dig>  rice osmads <dig>  and maize zmb4fml <dig>  cluster together forming a distinct subclass . as mentioned above due to the absence of a typical k-domain which is the hallmark of type-i proteins, we named these barley sequences as type i-like hvmads-box sequences.

expression analysis of the type i-like hvmads-box genes in different tissues and during seed development
end point pcr analysis showed that hvos <dig> transcripts were detected only in immature flowers in caresse, whereas they were present in all tissues of ippolytos examined. conversely, hvos <dig> transcripts are present in roots, shoots, apical meristem, leaves, and immature flowers in both caresse and ippolytos .

real time pcr analysis was employed to examine and compare the expression of barley type i-like hvmads-box genes at different seed developmental stages and in different cultivars, caresse  and ippolytos  .

for hvos <dig>  an induction of approximately  <dig> fold in caresse 1– <dig> daf and 3– <dig> daf seed, and a decrease thereafter, was observed. in ippolytos, hvos <dig> was induced in 1– <dig> and 3– <dig> daf seeds by approximately  <dig> fold. transcript levels dropped by about  <dig> fold in 5– <dig> daf seeds whereas they increased slightly in 10– <dig> daf as compared to immature flowers. in caresse 15– <dig> daf seeds transcript levels increased by about  <dig> fold, whereas in ippolytos 15– <dig> daf they decreased by about  <dig> fold .

a marked increase of approximately  <dig> fold in hvos <dig> transcript accumulation was observed in caresse seeds 1– <dig> daf and 3– <dig> daf, as compared to immature unfertilized flowers. expression levels dropped thereafter in 5– <dig>  10– <dig> and 15– <dig> daf seeds to levels comparable to those of unfertilized flowers. in the small-seed cultivar, ippolytos, hvos <dig> exhibited substantial transcript accumulation in seeds 1– <dig> daf and 3– <dig> daf. in 5– <dig> daf and 10– <dig> daf seeds hvos <dig> had a pronounced increase of approximately 10– <dig> fold, in contrast to caresse. in caresse seeds 15– <dig> daf there was a slight increase of hvos <dig> transcript. conversely, a substantial decrease of about  <dig> fold was seen in ippolytos 15– <dig> daf seeds . expression of hvos <dig> was examined in another large-seed cultivar, byzantio. similar to caresse, hvos <dig> transcript levels were significantly lower in 5– <dig>  10– <dig> daf seeds as compared to ippolytos .

more detailed expression of the hvos <dig> gene within the seed was examined by in situ localizations using cross sections of seeds and dig-labelled antisense probe. strong hybridization signal was observed in the aleurone layer and the first layer of endosperm cells adjacent to the aleurone layer that was absent from the sense-control , suggesting cell-specific expression in the endosperm. in addition, strong hybridization signal was observed in embryo cells between sections hybridized with antisense as well as sense probes suggesting no specific expression in the embryo. hvos <dig> analysis was not possible due to lack of appropriate sequences specific for the hvos <dig> gene satisfying the particular needs of this experiment.

expression analysis of the type i-like hvmads-box genes in response to ja and aba
since ja and aba responsive elements were detected on the promoters of both genes  quantitative real time pcr was performed using total rna from seven-day-old seedlings subjected to exogenous application with ja and aba in order to examine whether expression of the type i-like hvmads-box genes responds to these hormones. hvos <dig> showed a significant increase of approximately  <dig>  fold and  <dig> fold at 6 h and 24 h, respectively, after application of aba, as compared to the control samples. hvos <dig> did not display statistically significant expression changes after aba treatments .

hvos <dig> showed a significant induction of about  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold at 6 h and 24 h, respectively, after ja treatment, as compared to the control. the hvos <dig> transcript was increased by about  <dig> fold at 24 h after ja treatment . two barley genes hva <dig> and hvadc <dig> known to be induced by aba and ja, respectively, were used as positive control genes for the aba and ja treatments .

genomic organization
analysis of the genomic structure of the cereal type i-like mads-box homologues was performed by retrieving the genomic sequences of osmads <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  and zmb4fml <dig> via blast in the phytozome database  using the full length ests. partial hvos <dig> genomic sequence was identified on two different contigs after a search in the barley database http://webblast.ipk-gatersleben.de/barley/index.php. no genomic data are available, thus far, for hvos <dig>  the organization of exons and introns of all five genes was then identified using the spidey tool in ncbi . the genomic organization of the cereal type i-like mads-box homologues was found to be very similar, all five genes containing five exons interrupted by four introns of approximately the same size and relative positions . a remarkably large intron of 17566 bp, 17913 bp, 14104 bp and 23857 bp, for osmads <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  bradi2g <dig> and zmb4fml <dig>  respectively, interrupts exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> in all four genes. the two contigs carrying hvos <dig> are not overlapping thus the first intron was not obtained fully . since hvos <dig> exon  <dig> and the beginning of intron  <dig> reside on non-overlapping contigs, the 5333 bp represent the minimum length of the genomic fragment harboring all exons and introns and the 3418 bp the minimum length of the first intron. the large size of the first introns intrigued us into inspecting further these sequences for the presence of retroelements. recently our group has developed advanced in silico methods   for detecting and analyzing retrotransposons  <cit>  <cit> . using these methods a 8993 bp region  in the middle of the zmb4fml <dig> first intron was found to have high similarity with the full length of the copia pzmay_cs_u68408_opie retrotransposon, which is a sirevirus element,  and especially at the long terminal repeats . the 3’ltr corresponds to a 1277 bp region  and the 5’ltr spans a 1253 bp region  within the zmb4fml <dig> first intron sequence. similarly, a 543 bp region  in the beginning of the first intron of bradi2g <dig> displayed high similarity with the gypsy pbdis_gx_addn <dig> retrotransposon, at regions encompassing the 5’ltr  and 3’ltr , respectively . homology to retrotransposons was not observed for any other genomic region of zmb4fml <dig> and bradi2g <dig>  no homology with retrotransposons was found in the bradi2g <dig>  osmads <dig> and hvos <dig> genes.

greenup et al.  have assigned a position for hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> on barley chromosome 3 h, in syntenic regions to brachypodium and rice, and proximal to the unigene  <dig>  <cit> . analysis in harvest found unigene  <dig> to reside close to the popa3_ <dig> snp marker on the comparative barley maps. this position is in proximity to important qtl markers for seed quality traits such as grain protein content  and grain yield  .

presence of regulatory elements in the 5’ upstream regions of type i-like hvmads-box genes
5’ upstream sequences of the type i-likehvmads-box genes were isolated  using genome walking in the cultivar caresse. 5’ upstream regions of these genes were interrogated for known cis-acting regulatory elements and results were analyzed with special attention to elements identified and characterized in cereals. the 5’ upstream region of both hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> genes showed the presence of endosperm-specific-elements, and aba and ja responsive elements . hvos <dig> also contains a gibberellin-responsive-element. tata and caat boxes were also detected. further inspection of these sequences was carried out in order to identify regions which may be prone to cytosine-methylation. predicted cpg islands which may play important roles in the regulation of gene expression via dna methylation-directed silencing were identified in both sequences .

dna methylation differences in the 5’ and 3’ flanking regions of type i-like hvmads-box genes
in order to examine the dna methylation pattern of the type i-likehvmads-box regulatory regions and uncover potential links to gene expression differences among different developmental stages, we performed mcrbc digestions of genomic dna and subsequent pcr amplification analysis. mcrbc is a methylation-dependent restriction enzyme which digests dna that is methylated at two or more cytosines, thus reducing pcr amplification of a selected fragment proportionally to the methylated cytosines  <cit> . therefore the presence or absence  of amplicons after pcr amplification of mcrbc-digested genomic dna with primers specific for a particular region suggests lower or higher degree of methylation within this region, respectively. we chose two developmental stages with the largest differences in expression, caresse immature flowers and 1– <dig> daf seeds.

in hvos <dig> there was less degree of amplification of the 5’upstream region  in mcrbc-digested than undigested genomic dna in immature flower, whereas there was no difference in 1– <dig> daf seeds , implying more methylation sites in immature flowers than 1– <dig> daf seeds. this might account for reduced expression of the gene in immature flowers. amplification of the 3’ downstream region  in mcrbc-digested dna was not reduced compared to undigested genomic dna either in immature flowers or in 1– <dig> daf seeds implying low methylation in this region .

for hvos <dig>  two non-coding regions, a 1170 bp region , and a 264 bp region located 3’downstream from the coding region , and two coding regions  were analyzed . pcr amplification of immature flower genomic dna digested with mcrbc did not produce the expected 1170 bp upstream fragment contrary to the digested sample, suggesting the presence of methylated sites within region  <dig> in immature flower genomic dna. the 1170 bp amplicon was produced from both mcrbc-digested and undigested genomic dna from 1– <dig> daf seeds suggesting a lower degree of methylation within region  <dig> in 1– <dig> daf genomic dna. the presence of higher dna methylation level in the promoter of hvos <dig> in immature flowers may be associated with downregulation of this gene in this tissue as compared to the high levels of expression in 1– <dig> daf seeds. examination of the 3’ downstream region  revealed that the expected fragment was amplified after mcrbc-pcr amplification of immature flower genomic dna although to a lesser extent than the undigested sample . interestingly, amplification of mcrbc-digested 1– <dig> daf genomic dna produced nearly no amplicon, implying a much higher degree of dna methylation in the 3’downstream region of hvos <dig> in 1– <dig> daf than in immature flowers. finally, examination of two sites within the coding region, in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> , did not show any decrease of pcr amplification in mcrbc-digested as compared to undigested dna, either in immature flowers or in 1– <dig> daf .

two regions were also examined within the hvactin gene, one within the coding region  and one in the 3’region downstream from the coding region . there were no obvious differences in the amplification of these regions between mcrbc-digested and non-digested genomic dna, suggesting no methylation sites in these fragments . the larger than expected size of the pcr product after amplification of region  <dig>  implies the presence of a small intron in that region.

genomic dna methylation assays were also performed for hvos <dig> in aba-treated and untreated seedlings . hvos <dig> is induced upon aba expression . interestingly, examination of a hvos <dig> 3’utr region  revealed no pcr amplification in the mcrbc-digested genomic dna from 24 h aba-treated seedlings, suggesting the presence of methylation sites in this region. less pcr amplification was observed in mcrbc-digested than undigested genomic dna in untreated seedlings suggesting a lower degree of methylation in untreated than aba-treated seedlings . in region  <dig> of the promoter, nearly no amplification is detected in aba-treated and non aba treated mcrbc-digested dna, suggesting dna methylation in this region. a third fragment within the coding region  was also tested and showed no pcr amplification in mcrbc-digested dna from both aba-treated and non aba-treated seedlings implying dna methylation in this region with and without aba. the larger than expected size of the pcr product after amplification of region  <dig>  implies the presence of a small intron in that region.

discussion
in the current study we present the identification, protein sequence structural analysis, phylogenetic characterization, expression profiles, genomic organization and promoter analysis of two genes encoding type i-like mads-box proteins in barley. during the course of our studies greenup et al.  reported the identification of these genes in barley and named them hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> <cit> . these authors focused their investigations on the role of these genes in the vernalization response and proposed a cereal-specific pathway controlling vernalization-induced flowering in temperate cereals different from the one reported for arabidopsis.

we have focused our study on detailed in silico structural analysis of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> protein sequences and on gene expression during seed development, in different cultivars, and in response to the seed developmental- and stress-related hormones aba and ja. moreover we have examined 5’ and 3’ regulatory regions of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> for differential dna methylation patterns that may be associated with differential gene expression.

protein sequence analysis
both hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> encode proteins possessing a mads-box domain, lacking the typical k-box of type ii mads-box proteins, and having highest resemblance to two type i mads-box proteins from wheat, taagl- <dig> and taagl- <dig>  respectively. phylogenetic analysis showed that the two barley type i-like mads-box proteins together with their putative orthologues from wheat , brachypodium , rice  and maize , form a cluster which is closer related to the alpha clade of type i mads-box proteins . interestingly this group does not contain sequences from arabidopsis or other dicots.

differential expression during vegetative, reproductive and seed development
qualitative rt-pcr expression analysis in different tissues showed that the hvos <dig> transcript was expressed in roots, apical meristem, young shoots, leaves, and immature flowers in ippolytos but was present only in immature flowers in caresse and was not detected in the other tissues examined. on the other hand, the hvos <dig> transcript is present in roots, apical meristem, young shoots, leaves of seedlings and in immature flowers in two different barley cultivars, caresse and ippolytos. in that sense, hvos <dig> expression in ippolytos and hvos <dig> expression in both cultivars resembles the arabidopsis type i mads-box gene agl <dig> gene which is expressed widely in vegetative and reproductive tissues  <cit> .

type i mads-box genes have been shown to be expressed in the female gametophyte and the developing seeds in arabidopsis and rice and have been assigned crucial roles in seed development through functional characterization in arabidopsis. in order to start understanding the role of the two barley type i-like mads-box genes in seed development we conducted quantitative real-time pcr analysis to examine their expression in unfertilized flowers and during different seed developmental stages in two barley cultivars with varying seed size, caresse  and ippolytos . quantitative real time pcr analysis demonstrated significant differences in gene expression among different seed developmental stages within a cultivar and between two cultivars with different seed size. in particular, both genes exhibited a remarkable induction post-fertilization, in 1– <dig> daf and 3– <dig> daf seeds in caresse  and a decline at the later stages of seed development. likewise, an increase in transcript levels was evidenced for both genes in 1– <dig> daf and 3– <dig> daf seeds, in ippolytos. however, in ippolytos a remarkable increase was also observed for the hvos <dig> gene at the later seed stages of 10– <dig> daf and 15– <dig> daf and a large reduction in 15– <dig> daf, whereas such changes were not observed in caresse.

the expression pattern of type i-like hvmads-box genes agrees with the expression of most type i mads-box genes in arabidopsis, where they were found to be induced in early syncytial endosperm up to the  <dig> daf seed developmental stage  <cit> . hvos <dig> resembles its closest wheat homologue, taagl <dig>  being expressed in 6– <dig> daf seeds as well as in roots and leaves of seedlings  <cit> . on the other hand, expression of the wheat taagl <dig>  the closest homologue to hvos <dig>  is not detected either in immature flowers or in 6– <dig> daf seeds of wheat, implying a different role for this homologue in wheat at least in the particular cultivar studied. the rice osmads <dig> homologue has been reported to be widely expressed  <cit> . microarray and quantitative pcr analysis has generated an expression profile for the type i mads-box genes in rice  <cit> . most genes are expressed, during the vegetative and reproductive stages and during seed development. interestingly, quantitative pcr analysis showed that three genes of the mα clade, osmads <dig>  osmads <dig> and osmads <dig>  have a substantial induction in 5– <dig> daf and 10– <dig> daf seeds resembling the expression pattern of hvos <dig> in the ippolytos cultivar. osmads <dig>  osmads <dig> and osmads <dig> are the closest rice homologues to the barley type i-like hvmads-box genes, after osmads <dig>  protein sequence similarity together with similar expression patterns may reflect similar functional roles for these homologues in these two closely related cereal species.

significant differences in gene expression were observed between caresse, a large-seed cultivar and ippolytos, a small-seed cultivar. a striking increase in hvos <dig> transcript was found in ippolytos 5– <dig> daf seeds  and 10– <dig> daf seeds  as compared to the same seed developmental stages in caresse, suggesting cultivar-dependent differential gene expression. an increase in hvos <dig> transcript was also evidenced in ippolytos 10– <dig> daf seeds  as compared to the same seed stage in caresse. similar to caresse, examination of hvos <dig> expression in the large-seed cultivar, byzantio, also found significant differences  at the 5– <dig> and 10– <dig> daf seed stages between byzantio and the small-seed cultivar ippolytos, supporting a possible association of hvos <dig> expression and seed size.

differential expression of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig>  between caresse  and ippolytos  may suggest an association of these genes with the size of seed. in barley, endosperm cellularization begins at approximately  <dig> daf and ends at 6– <dig> daf, when the seed maturation process begins  <cit> . it may be possible that the differences in type i-like hvmads-box gene expression between the two cultivars during these critical stages of endosperm development are associated with the processes of cellularization and seed filling and ultimately with grain size. certainly, a large number of genotypes with different seed size should be further tested to conclusively assess any association of these genes with the size of seed.

in situ hybridization experiments localized hvos <dig> in the aleurone layer and in endosperm-specific cells situated adjacent to the aleurone layer, in  <dig> daf seeds. specific expression of this gene within the endosperm may be associated with particular gene expression programmes involved in seed maturation.

genomic organization
analysis of the genomic organization of the hvos <dig> revealed resemblance with its closest cereal homologues osmads <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  bradi2g <dig> and zmb4fml <dig>  extensive conservation in the exon-intron organization is evident among all five genes with five exons and four introns at approximately the same relative positions and approximately the same size except from the fifth exon of the maize gene zmb4fml <dig>  genomic organization for hvos <dig> was not possible due to lack of barley sequence information. with the rapid advancement in the sequencing of the barley genome  <cit>  the complete genomic sequence of both hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> will become available soon for further analysis.

a strikingly large first intron is present in all five cereal homologues studied. in osmads <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  bradi2g <dig>  zmb4fml <dig> this intron accounts for about 85-90% of the entire length of the gene bodies . notably, our analysis showed that the maize zmb4fml <dig> intron has high similarity to a full length maize sirevirus retrotransposon, copia pzmay_cs_u68408_opie. likewise, a fragment of the first intron of the bradi2g <dig> gene exhibits high similarity to remnants of pbdis_gx_addn <dig>  a brachypodium gypsy retrotransposon. homology with retrotransposons was not detected in the first intron of barley hvos <dig>  thus far.

recently a sensitive comparative analysis of the genomes of the plant-specific sireviruses retrotransposons was performed  <cit> , in an effort to understand their significance in the evolution of their plant hosts and their putative role in the epigenetic regulation of plant genes. in addition, our group reported a systematic analysis of > <dig>  intact and ~ <dig>  degenerate maize sireviruses  <cit>  discovered by the masive algorithm in maize, and showed that sireviruses account for 90% of the copia type population, comprising 21% of the maize genome, and reside in near-gene areas. the element pzmay_cs_u68408_opie found within the intron of the maize zmb4fml <dig> gene belongs to opie, one of the most abundant families of the copia genera and its location within an intron may suggest additional insertion sites of sireviruses within genes.

it has become more and more evident that intact or remnants of transposable elements may be implicated in the transcriptional regulation of flowering plants especially in the control of gene imprinting  <cit> . most imprinted genes, mainly expressed only from the maternal allele, are found in the female gametophyte and in the endosperm of the developing seed  <cit> . massive demethylation of transposable elements and regions generating sirnas was shown to take place in the arabidopsis endosperm as opposed to the embryo  <cit>  and it has been hypothesized that fragments of transposable element inserted near genic regulatory elements may guide dna methylation at specific alleles and govern imprinted gene expression   <cit> . presence of transposable elements within introns in genes of cereals may perform similar regulatory functions.

in silico mapping of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> identified a corresponding snp marker on barley chromosome 3 h close to regions associated with important agronomical traits such as grain protein content and grain yield. this could prove important for the development of functional markers to be used in marker assisted selection for breeding programmes.

promoter elements
promoter sequence analysis revealed putative cpg regions within the 5’upstream regions of both hvos <dig> and hvos <dig>  in addition several regulatory elements were identified, including elements related to endosperm and seed development such as endosperm-specific elements and aba and gibberrellin-responsive elements. these observations together with the expression patterns at different seed developmental stages and in response to the seed development-related hormone aba, mentioned above, reinforces the suggestion for functional roles for these genes in barley seed development.

ja responsive elements were also identified on the promoters of both hvos <dig> and hvos <dig>  aba and ja elements identified in the 5’upstream regions of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> were also detected in the promoters of several of the rice homologues such as osmads <dig> and osmads <dig> and brachypodium homologues, bradi2g <dig> and bradi2g <dig> . the hormones ja and aba are known to mediate abiotic stress responses in plants. it is possible that type i-like hvmads-box genes are responsive to aba- or ja- associated stress conditions. in support to this the taagl <dig> homologue is induced by cold stress in two winter wheat cultivars  <cit>  and a number of type i-mads-box genes in rice were found to be induced by abiotic stress such as cold, drought, and increased salinity  <cit> .

dna methylation
dna methylation analysis was undertaken to reveal whether differentially methylated regions exist in the 5’upstream and 3’downstream regions of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> between two different seed developmental stages with different gene expression levels. in particular, using the mcrbc-pcr assay it was shown that the 5’upstream region of hvos <dig> is highly methylated in caresse immature flowers as compared to 1– <dig> daf seeds where lower degree of methylation was observed. it is likely that the observed downregulation of hvos <dig> in immature flowers may be due, in part, to a dna methylation silencing effect. similarly, a higher degree of dna methylation in the 5’ upstream region of hvos <dig> in immature flowers as opposed to low dna methylation in 1– <dig> daf seeds suggests that downregulation of hvos <dig> in immature flower maybe be partially due to a dna methylation repressive mechanism. notably, a genome-wide analysis in arabidopsis demonstrated extensive global dna demethylation in 5’ upstream and 3’ downstream regions in endosperm but not in embryo tissue and this is associated with gene activation in endosperm and gene silencing in the embryo, respectively  <cit> . a similar epigenetic mechanism could be operating in cereals seeds. the endosperm in monocot species  is not consumed by the embryo during seed development as is the case in dicots, but rather develops to the mature seed which contains storage proteins and starch and constitutes the nutritional part of the seed. although our study did not separate embryo from endosperm tissue, we may assume that the seed of 1– <dig> daf in barley is mainly represented by endosperm syncytium with very small contribution from the embryo. further studies will enable us to draw any parallels between dicots and monocots concerning dna methylation and endosperm development.

dna methylation in the 3’downstream region of hvos <dig> was found to be increased in 1– <dig> daf seeds where the gene is highly induced, than in immature flowers where the gene is downregulated. this resembles the methylation status of the arabidopsis phe <dig> where the 3’downstream region of the expressed paternal allele was found to be methylated, whereas the silenced maternal allele was unmethylated in the same region  <cit> .

since hvos <dig> was found to be induced upon aba treatment we investigated whether dna differential methylation is evidenced in aba treated and untreated seedlings. notably, examination of the hvos <dig> 3’utr region  in aba-treated seedlings revealed higher degree of dna methylation in leaves of aba-treated seedlings than in untreated seedlings. this is the first time that dna methylation has been investigated in mads-box genes in association to hormonal treatment. it is likely that differential dna methylation may be associated to differential expression of this barley gene in response to aba.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments performed by greenup et al.  demonstrated the presence of the h3k4me <dig> gene activation mark, deposited by a trithorax  methyltransferase, and found higher h3k4me <dig> in non vernalized than vernalized tissue, in agreement with hvos <dig> decreased expression upon vernalization  <cit> . they also demonstrated the presence of h3k27me <dig> mark  on the 5’ utr region of hvos <dig>  though levels were low both in vernalized and non vernalized tissue. this may be related to the fact that dna methylation may exclude sites from h3k27me as mentioned in weinhofer et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the observations by these authors together with our current results suggest that hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> are targets of epigenetic regulation by histone modifications or dna methylation.

epigenetic regulation of endosperm-related genes such as type i mads-box genes and prc <dig> polycomb group genes like mea, through dna methylation and/or histone modifications, has been well documented in arabidopsis especially for phe <dig>  agl <dig> and agl <dig> and mea  <cit> . our current results on barley type i-like mads-box genes point to a role for these genes in endosperm development. moreover, differences in dna methylation at different seed developmental stages with different gene expression suggest epigenetic regulation of endosperm-associated genes in barley. in support to this, our group has recently characterized barley epigenetic regulators such as histone deacetylases , histone acetyltransferases , prc <dig> polycomb group genes, trithorax  histone methyltransferase and histone demethylase  genes, and investigated their roles during seed development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work two type i-like mads-box gene homologues were studied during seed development in barley. hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> are related to type i mads-box genes and exhibit differential expression in particular seed developmental stages in a cultivar-specific manner. hvos <dig> is induced by the phytohormone aba and hvos <dig> is detected in specific endosperm sub- compartments. together these observations point to a role for hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> in seed development. dna methylation differences associated with differences in gene expression are suggestive of epigenetic regulation of hvos <dig> and hvos <dig> in barley, in accordance to arabidopsis type i mads genes. the current study provides further important knowledge for the understanding of gene regulation during seed development in barley and other agronomically important cereals.
