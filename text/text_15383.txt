BACKGROUND
benzylisoquinoline alkaloids  are a diverse class of plant specialized metabolites that includes approximately  <dig> known compounds. although bias present a wide range of structural backbone arrangements, they are united in their common biosynthetic origin, which begins with the condensation of two tyrosine derivatives forming the first dedicated bia, -norcoclaurine . several of humanity’s most ancient medicines, poisons, hunting aids, and ceremonial preparations derive from plants accumulating bias, with examples found in both old world and new world cultures  <cit> . notable bia-accumulating plants include morphine, codeine, and noscapine-accumulating opium poppy , members of the berberine-accumulating barberry  genus, japanese goldthread , meadowrue , and species producing the antimicrobial sanguinarine, such as mexican prickly poppy  and california poppy . these plants form a core group of model species studied extensively in past decades, leading to the near-complete elucidation of major pathways at the biochemical and molecular genetic levels. most or all enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of papaverine, morphine, sanguinarine, berberine and noscapine have been cloned and characterized   <cit> . a restricted number of enzyme families have been implicated in bia metabolism, which likely reflects a monophyletic origin for the pathway  <cit> . this feature has enabled homology-based enzyme discovery strategies, where predictions are made regarding enzyme type acting at unresolved points along the bia metabolic network. for example, c-c or c-o coupling reactions are almost exclusively catalyzed by cytochromes p <dig> with homology to one of cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  or cyp <dig> families, or 2-oxoglutarate/fe2+-dependent dioxygenases. resolution of previously uncharacterized steps in sanguinarine and noscapine metabolism has been achieved through homology-based querying of transcriptome resources coupled with targeted metabolite analysis  <cit> . this approach was used recently for the discovery of dihydrosanguinarine benzophenanthridine oxidase , a fad-dependent oxidase with homology to berberine bridge enzyme   <cit> . other enzyme types found repeatedly within bia metabolism include o- and n-methyltransferases, bahd acylating enzymes  <cit>  and reductases belonging to either aldo-keto   <cit>  or short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase   <cit>  superfamilies. only the first step of bia biosynthesis is catalyzed by a unique protein family, pathogenesis-related  <dig> /bet v <dig> allergens, otherwise absent within alkaloid metabolism -norcoclaurine synthase). nonetheless, homologues of ncs appear to play this key entry-point role across different plant taxa  <cit> .fig.  <dig> major routes of bia biosynthesis leading to -reticuline , papaverine , morphine , sanguinarine , berberine  and noscapine . c-o and c-c coupling reactions are shown for berbamunine  and corytuberine , respectively. red within each alkaloid highlights enzyme-catalyzed structural changes. solid and dotted arrows represent reactions catalyzed by single and multiple enzymes, respectively. enzymes abbreviated in blue text have been characterized at the molecular level, whereas those in black text have not been cloned. abbreviations: 3'-ohase, 3'-hydroxylase; 3'omt, 3'-o-methyltransferase; 3ohase, 3-hydroxylase; 4hppdc, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate decarboxylase; 4'omt, 3'-hydroxy-n-methylcoclaurine 4'-o-methyltransferase; 6omt, norcoclaurine 6-o-methyltransferase; at <dig>   <dig> -dihydroxy-n-methylcanadine 13-o-acetyltransferase; bbe, berberine bridge enzyme; bs, berbamunine synthase; cas, canadine synthase; cfs, cheilanthifoline synthase; cnmt, coclaurine n-methyltransferase; codm, codeine o-demethylase; coomt, columbamine o-methyltransferase; cor, codeinone reductase; cts, corytuberine synthase; cyp82x <dig>  1-hydroxy-13-o-acetyl-n-methylcanadine 8-hydroxylase; cyp82x <dig>  1-hydroxy-n-methylcanadine 13-hydroxylase; cyp82y <dig>  n-methylcanadine 1-hydroxylase; cdbox, dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase; cxe <dig>  3-o-acetylpapaveroxine carboxylesterase; msh, n-methylstylopine hydroxylase; n7omt, norreticuline 7-o-methyltransferase; ncs, norcoclaurine synthase; nmcanh, n-methylcanadine 1-hydroxylase; nmch, n-methylcoclaurine 3'-hydroxylase; nos, noscapine synthase; p6h, protopine 6-hydroxylase; repi, reticuline epimerase; salat, salutaridinol 7-o-acetyltransferase; salr, salutaridine reductase; salsyn, salutaridine synthase; sanr, sanguinarine reductase; somt, scoulerine 9-o-methyltransferase; sps, stylopine synthase; stox, -tetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase; t6odm, thebaine 6-o-demethylase; tnmt, tetrahydroprotoberberine n-methyltransferase; tydc, tyrosine decarboxylase; tyrat, tyrosine aminotransferase



beyond model species, a myriad of other plants are known to accumulate bias. the structural diversity of these alkaloids is remarkable, yet their biosynthesis is largely or entirely unexplored. many of these compounds have potent pharmacological activities, and plants accumulating them boast long histories of use in traditional medicine. members of the cissampelos genus, which accumulate novel bisbenzylisoquinoline, aporphine, and promorphinan-type alkaloids  have been employed for centuries as hunting poisons and herbal remedies, particularly in south america and sub-saharan africa  <cit> . trilobine, a highly crosslinked, atypical bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, is thought to confer antiamoebic activity to herbal cocculus preparations for the treatment of infant diarrhea  <cit> . many plants of the papaveraceae produce alkaloids featuring unique variations on the basic protoberberine and benzophenanthridine backbones, and some genus such as corydalis accumulate a surprising variety of bia types, including protopine, pthalideisoquinoline, spirobenzylisoquinoline, and morphinan alkaloids  <cit> . how these alkaloids are formed is poorly understood, and scarce resources are available for the non-model plants capable of producing them. to enable pathway elucidation and novel enzyme discovery, we have generated expansive datasets for twenty bia-accumulating plants using roche  <dig> and illumina sequencing platforms. data mining frameworks were constructed using a multitude of annotation approaches based on direct searches of public databases, and associated information was collected and summarized for every unigene, including kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway maps, gene ontology  and enzyme commission  annotations. a comprehensive, broad-scope metabolite survey was performed in tandem with the herein presented transcriptome analysis, on identical plant tissues  <cit> . used together, these unprecedented resources will allow the assembly of biochemical snapshots representing bia metabolism in largely unexplored systems, guiding pathway elucidation and search efforts for new catalysts. moreover, the availability of enzyme variants mined from different plant species will dramatically expand the ‘toolbox’ essential to synthetic biology efforts.

RESULTS
species and tissue selection for enrichment of biosynthetic genes
twenty plant species were chosen for transcriptomic analysis, based primarily on alkaloid accumulation profiles, as determined by relevant literature sources and our concomitant study of metabolite content for candidate species  <cit> . other considerations included taxonomic distribution, use in traditional medicine or cultural practices  and tissue availability. priority was assigned to species for which sequence information was unavailable or lacking. we targeted four plant families within the order ranunculales: the papaveraceae , ranunculaceae , berberidaceae  and menispermaceae  . although bias have been reported in diverse angiosperm taxa, they occur most commonly in these families  <cit> . strong evidence supports the monophyletic origin of the ranunculales, and within this order, the papaveraceae family appears to have diverged early from the ‘core’ ranunculales group   <cit> . further evidence supports an early, monophyletic origin of bia biosynthesis prior to the emergence of eudicots  <cit>  suggesting that the last common ancestor of ranunculales species was already making alkaloids. to enrich for bia biosynthetic transcripts, analysis was restricted to alkaloid-rich organs  or callus culture . as an alternative to intact plants, cell cultures have been used for more than three decades as biosynthetic models and alkaloid production systems  <cit> . in vitro plant cell cultures have been instrumental in the discovery of several key enzymes and regulatory processes within sanguinarine, berberine, noscapine and morphine biosynthesis  <cit> . recently, modest libraries  for  <dig> alkaloid-producing cultures, including callus of three menispermaceae species, were established  <cit> . to build on these resources, callus of cocculus trilobus, tinospora cordifolia and cissampelos mucronata were chosen for deep sequencing.table  <dig> details of plant species selected for deep sequencing analysis

roche versus illumina platforms: benefits of enhanced read depth
rna was screened for sufficient quality and quantity prior to deep sequencing by either roche gs-flx titanium or illumina ga/hiseq platforms. for illumina-based sequencing, ga  and hiseq instruments were employed to generate data of essentially equal quality, permitting subsequent pooling of the data. table  <dig> summarizes the results for both technologies, while additional files  <dig> and  <dig> tabulate further details regarding roche and illumina-based platforms, respectively. data for  <dig> of the  <dig> species  were published previously, although minor errors were noted . presented herein are corrected values, included for comparative purposes along with data for  <dig> new plant species. multiplatform studies have highlighted certain advantages of illumina-based sequencing over other technologies, which include lower costs , high accuracy  and good read depth, permitting robust transcript quantification  <cit> . good read depth herein is reflected as high average reads per base pair  permitting nearly double the number of average unigenes per library compared with roche technology . conversely, advantages of roche  <dig> gs flx-based sequencing include longer average read lengths  enabling reliable detection of splice variants. despite longer reads, roche-based sequencing resulted in less predicted full-length coding sequences  compared with illumina-based sequencing . nonetheless, using two different platforms had the inherent advantage of enhanced overall transcriptome coverage. roche and illumina libraries averaged ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  full-length cdss respectively, with an average of ~ <dig> cds intersects between the libraries as determined by conservative, mega blast estimates with an e-value cutoff of  <dig> . the low number of cds intersects likely reflects the use of stringent blast parameters rather than inherent differences between the two libraries, and increasing the e-value cutoff would be expected to reveal greater concordance.table  <dig> annotation summaries for roche-based and illumina-based transcriptomes

library comparisons reveal isolated cases of low intersection
variation in library quality between different source tissues  was not apparent. for quality control measures, illumina-based sequencing was performed on both stem and root of chelidonium majus yielding comparable results . however, library quality appeared reduced in isolated cases. for example, the illumina-based cocculus trilobus library consisted of a large number of reads, but yielded an above average number of unassembled contigs and a small number of full-length cdss . conversely, roche-based c. trilobus sequencing appeared relatively successful . as illumina- and roche-based libraries were constructed using the same source material, we ruled out the possibility that c. trilobus tissue was compromised, as poor tissue quality would have affected both transcriptomes, not just the illumina data. another illumina library with reduced full-length cdss  and low intersection with roche data included mahonia aquifolium. it is possible that cross-contamination with samples derived from other plants occurred in these cases, precluding proper assembly and separation of foreign or native sequences at later stages.

establishment of fully annotated blast- accessible transcriptomes
on average, 79 %  and 69 %  of all unigenes received a functional annotation, with high-level annotations based on more stringent criteria assigned to 57 %  and 50 %  . enzyme commission  number allocation was included in the analysis to gain insight on the number of enzymes represented in each library, and enable corresponding links to kegg pathway maps . more importantly for enzyme discovery, ec assignments can facilitate word searches based on enzyme function. on average for both roche and illumina libraries, about 12 % of all annotations corresponded to an ec number. low success in ec number assignments was noted for c. trilobus and m. aquifolium illumina libraries, likely due to poor assembly of full-length cdss. results for every unigene, including constituent reads, expression data, blast results, annotation evidence and relevant links are summarized on individual pages available through magpie. a previously established magpie-based blast portal  <cit>  is available for public access to the assembled data of each transcriptome reported herein .

homology-based mining of bia biosynthetic genes
illumina and roche 454-based transcriptomes were mined for candidate genes putatively involved in bia metabolism. tblastn searches were performed on the basis of homology to fully characterized alkaloid biosynthetic enzymes, using a cutoff of 40 % sequence identity in most cases. exceptions include o-acetyltransferases  and carboxylesterases  where a search cutoff of 30 % was generally used. for oats and cxes, greater sequence divergence between taxonomic groups was evident, prompting more flexible search criteria. a pre-defined cutoff was not required in some cases, since tblastn yielded a small number of hits with relatively high identity. for example, searches using berberine bridge enzyme from eschscholtzia californica, papaver somniferum and berberis stolonifera  yielded a total of  <dig> hits with substantial  identity. similar results were obtained for dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase -like fad-dependent oxidases . in total, ~ <dig> candidate unigenes were selected from  <dig> deep sequencing libraries, representing  <dig> bia-accumulating plant species. additional file  <dig> lists the amino acid sequences of these candidates in fasta format.

gene expression for candidate selection and bottleneck identification
expression data were recorded for each candidate in the form of fpkm  extracted from illumina libraries. figure  <dig> summarizes results obtained for papaveroideae tribe members . expression results for corydalis chelanthifolia , berberidaceae and ranunculaceae species are found in additional file  <dig>  and results for menispermaceae species are found in additional file  <dig>  expression analyses were not performed for m. aquifolium and c. trilobus due to reduced numbers of full-length cdss. expression values were normalized across all illumina libraries, permitting cross-species comparison . fpkm and related rna-seq tools are reliable expression metrics; in fact, recent head-to-head comparison of illumina and microarray-based data showed that rna-seq dramatically outperforms microarray in identifying differentially expressed genes  <cit> . for the purpose of novel catalyst discovery, gene expression data can be used to prioritize candidates for further analysis. genes highly expressed in bia-synthesizing tissues can be selected over candidates with very low expression levels. for example, while  <dig> putative -norcoclaurine synthase  candidates were identified within papaveraceae libraries, some of these unigenes were observed only as low-read roche contigs and were entirely absent from illumina data . lack of illumina data could reflect a platform bias or processing error, although it is possibly the result of very low gene expression. expression comparisons can be made across different gene families to gain insight regarding putative metabolic bottlenecks. papaver bracteatum accumulates large quantities of thebaine but only trace amounts of downstream alkaloids codeine and oripavine  <cit> , implicating a metabolic block at thebaine 6-o-demethylase  and codeine o-demethylase  . t6odm and codm have been characterized in opium poppy and belong to the fe2+/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase  family  <cit> . compared with other bia-biosynthetic genes in p. bracteatum, diox homologues are expressed at very low levels, possibly contributing to observed pathway restrictions.fig.  <dig> normalized expression analysis for gene candidates potentially involved in bia biosynthesis in papaveraceae  species. each candidate is labeled with respective species abbreviations  and the type of enzyme potentially encoded by the gene . candidates present exclusively in roche-based transcriptomes could not be assigned an fpkm value, and are marked with asterisk. refer to table  <dig> for species abbreviations. enzyme/protein family abbreviations: bbe, berberine bridge enzyme; cor, codeinone reductase; cxe, carboxylesterase; cyp, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase; diox, dioxygenase; fad, fad-dependent oxidase; ncs, norcoclaurine synthase; nmt, n-methyltransferase; nos, noscapine synthase; oat, o-acetyltransferase; omt, o-methyltransferase; salr, salutaridine reductase; sanr, sanguinarine reductase



phylogenetic analysis as prediction tool for gene function: nmt case study
amino-acid alignments and phylogenetic trees were assembled for  <dig> classes of protein/enzymes, representing a total of ~ <dig> gene candidates. figures  <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the trees built using cyp <dig> and n-methyltransferase candidates, respectively. remaining trees are found in the additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  used together with the corresponding fpkm data and species-specific alkaloid profiles  <cit>  these results represent an important resource for the discovery of new enzymes catalyzing  previously characterized reactions  and  reactions uncharacterized at the biochemical and molecular levels. to test our hypothesis that phylogenetic considerations could be used to predict enzyme function, we designed an empirical case study using glaucium flavum n-methyltransferase  gene candidates. homology-based mining revealed six full-length nmt candidates in both roche- and illumina-based g. flavum transcriptomes . phylogenetic analysis revealed closer relationships between certain g. flavum candidates to characterized enzymes compared to others. for example, gflnmt <dig> formed a six-member clade with psocnmt, an established coclaurine n-methyltransferase  from papaver somniferum  <cit>  . in contrast, gflnmt <dig> formed a 6-member clade including -tetrahydroprotoberberine n-methyltransferase  from eschscholzia californica   <cit> . on the basis of these results, it was predicted that gflnmt <dig> and gflnmt <dig> enzymes would exhibit cnmt and tnmt activities, respectively. although the remaining gflnmts did not form similarly small clades with, or exhibit such high identity  to known enzymes, activity with bia substrates was anticipated owing to the >40 % identity with query sequences. all six g. flavum candidates were produced in escherichia coli as his-tagged recombinant proteins, each of which showed a predicted molecular weight as determined by comparison with molecular weight standards . each protein was tested for nmt activity using six key alkaloid substrates . indeed, gflnmt <dig> and gflnmt <dig> exhibited cnmt and tnmt activities using coclaurine and protoberberine substrates, respectively. further, our prediction that all g. flavum enzymes would accept bia substrates proved correct. gflnmt <dig> acted as tnmt using -stylopine substrate, but unexpectedly also n-methylated -reticuline. -reticuline n-methyltransferase activity was also observed for gflnmt <dig>  gflnmt <dig> acted as cnmt with the notable distinction of carrying out subsequent n,n-dimethylation reactions to form a quaternary amine. although gflnmt <dig> did not cluster closely with characterized cnmt , it accepted coclaurine substrate. these results demonstrate the general utility of phylogenetic analysis as a predictive tool, but underscore the need for empirical assay data for the purposes of gene discovery.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of cyp <dig> gene candidates from twenty bia-accumulating plant species. red text denotes characterized genes or enzymes used as tblastn queries for transcriptome mining. black text denotes uncharacterized gene candidates identified through mining . bootstrap values for each clade were based on  <dig> iterations. each candidate is labeled with respective species abbreviation  and candidate number . each query is labeled according to species  with cyp <dig> subfamily and gene number indicated . outgroup is cyp17a <dig> from homo sapiens . amino acid sequences for candidates, queries, and outgroups are found in additional file 6

functional homologue resource for synthetic biology
for the purposes of emerging synthetic biology initiatives, functional homologues - often termed enzyme 'variants' - are essential engineering tools. assembly of alkaloid pathways in microbes using heterologously expressed plant enzymes is fraught with problems - including poor protein expression, unpredictable/off-target activities, poor interaction with other pathway enzymes, and low catalytic efficiencies  <cit>  - which can be alleviated in some cases with variant substitution. for example, testing numerous combinations of methyltransferases from papaver somniferum and thalictrum flavum revealed that specific variants, and combinations of variants, ameliorated -reticuline production in yeast  <cit> . our collection of n- and o-methyltransferase candidates sourced from a wide variety of plants  will enable further refinement of alkaloid biosynthesis in unicellular systems.

candidates with putative roles in morphinan and aporphine alkaloid formation
identification of functional homologues with roles in morphinan alkaloid biosynthesis is an important objective, as reconstitution of this pathway in microbes is an emerging goal  <cit> . the illumina transcriptome of morphinan alkaloid-producing p. bracteatum contains three cyp <dig> candidates, which form a well-supported clade with opium poppy  salutaridine synthase . in addition, six p. bracteatum unigenes with substantial homology  to opium poppy salutaridine reductase  were identified . our study includes plant genera known to produce lesser-known morphinan alkaloids, such as corydalis, nandina and thalictrum, which produce -pallidine, sinoacutine, and -pallidine respectively  <cit> . significantly, these plants also produce a variety of aporphine alkaloids such as nantenine , isocorydine  and corydine . the biosynthetic pathways for these morphinan and aporphine alkaloids are not known, but likely rely on cyp-mediated c-c coupling of - or -reticuline. the relatively few  cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> candidates were identified in these species  could be tested for reticuline oxidase activity and evaluated for participation in morphinan and/or aporphine pathways.

potential new catalysts for phthalideisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis
guided by the recent elucidation of noscapine biosynthesis in opium poppy  <cit> , transcriptomes of phthalideisoquinoline-accumulating species were mined for novel catalysts. hydrastis canadensis produces hydrastine, hydrastidine, and other minor constituents  <cit>  whereas corydalis species accumulate a wide variety of phthalideisoquinoline alkaloids  <cit> . numerous acetyltransferase, carboxylesterase, and cyp <dig> candidates with possible involvement in phthalideisoquinoline biosynthesis were identified in h. canadensis and c. chelanthifolia transcriptomes. corydalis species accumulate the hemiacetal egenine  <cit> , which may require a noscapine synthase -like enzyme for hypothesized conversion to bicuculline  <cit> . six candidates were identified in c. chelanthifolia with up to 52 % identity to p. somniferum nos, although expression was very low in some cases . three nos-like gene candidates with possible roles as hydrastine synthases were identified in h. canadensis .

CONCLUSIONS
the establishment of fully annotated, deep-sequencing transcriptomes for twenty bia-accumulating plants represents an immense resource for novel catalyst discovery. blast-accessible transcriptomes were not previously available for most plants included in this report, despite the rich repertoire of bioactive alkaloids found in these species and their importance in traditional medicine. the results presented herein, together with accompanying metabolite profiles  <cit>  and relevant literature, are intended to provide necessary tools  and also inform experimental design for the continued elucidation of the bia metabolism.
