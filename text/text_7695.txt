BACKGROUND
efforts at extracting biologically meaningful information from the genome sequence of plasmodium sp. are fueled by the necessity to find new methods of malaria control. plasmodium falciparum resistance to most common antimalarials such as chloroquine, sulfadoxine or pyrimethamine, is now-days widespread, and resistance to other antimalarials is increasing alarmingly. there is recent evidence for emerging in vitro resistance to one of the major groups of drugs, artemisinins  <cit>  and treatment failures to recently introduced drug combinations including artemisinin derivatives  <cit> . research priorities include the discovery of new drugs, the understanding of drugs' mode of action and resistance mechanisms. whatever the drug's mode of action, a better appraisal of the biological processes taking place in a parasite dying within an erythrocyte is needed to uncover additional drug targets and potentiate the effect of existing weapons. towards reaching such goals, much hope rests on high through-put technologies such as dna microarrays aimed at the study of gene expression at the genome scale and proteomics. both approaches are complementary, and each has its own limitations. proteomic approaches are complicated by solubility issues, detection of low abundance proteins and post-translational alterations. both proteome and transcriptome approaches investigate steady state levels, a net sum of synthesis and decay of the gene product. transcriptome studies are limited by the uncertain correlation of steady state rna with protein levels. they nevertheless deliver a comprehensive and sensitive, genome-wide exploration of expression profiling. this proved invaluable in deciphering the developmental cycle gene expression patterns in malaria parasites  <cit> .

few studies have shown that the transcriptome of p. falciparum can be altered by exposure of the parasite to a drug. analysis of the parasite transcriptome under doxycyclin showed that apicoplast gene expression was deeply altered  <cit> . this study is so far the only published example of a specific transcriptome response to a drug related to the drug's known target-pathway. no significant changes of the mrna levels for enzymes involved in the lipid biosynthesis pathway could be evidenced upon exposure for 24– <dig> hours to the antimalarial choline analog t <dig>  which targets the inhibition of phosphatidyl choline biosynthesis  <cit> . in a recent study of the transcriptome of asynchronous p. falciparum cultures under chloroquine pressure  <cit> , around  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in presence of the drug, but only  <dig> of these were observed in two different experiments. such poor reproducibility of results along with the low expression ratios observed for these  <dig> genes was interpreted as reflecting limited reactivity of the parasite transcriptome to environmental stimuli and the possible importance of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation in plasmodium. however, the observed discrepancies may relate to different proportions of developmental stages in the  <dig> populations explored. indeed, parasite maturation stage is an essential variable to control, as a majority of p. falciparum genes are differentially expressed during the  <dig> hour erythrocytic cycle  <cit> . such developmentally regulated control of gene expression hinders the interpretation of results if drug treatment exerts a retardation effect on the parasite erythrocytic cycle.

we have used here a novel strategy and analysed the alterations of the parasite transcriptome in synchronous parasite cultures shortly after exposure to a lethal dose of artesunate, a rapidly acting drug. artemisinin derivatives are potent antimalarials that are the cornerstone of currently recommended drug combination to treat p. falciparum malaria  <cit> . artemisinins, which are endoperoxide-containing sesquiterpene lactones are structurally distinct from all other anti-malarials. importantly they are the most rapidly acting antimalarials known to date, which moreover are active on young as well mature erythrocytic stages  <cit> . these unique properties allowed the kinetic analysis of the events occurring in synchronous cultures of parasites exposed to a lethal drug concentration at different time points along the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. we explored the dynamics of transcriptome alteration during the process leading to parasite death in different parasite stages. this identified  <dig> genes with dynamic transcriptome alterations after exposure to artesunate.

RESULTS
choice of experimental design
in order to work with homogeneous parasite populations, tightly synchronized parasites were used in all experiments, along with an artesunate concentration which irreversibly damages 100% of the parasites within  <dig> hours. the lethal dose of artesunate, defined here as the minimal concentration needed for a  <dig> hour exposure to completely prevent reinvasion , was  <dig> nm. importantly, it corresponds to 100– <dig> times the ic <dig>  this dose remains physiological, being in the range of peak plasma concentration reached in patients administered artesunate   <cit> .

each experiment consisted in an artesunate-free culture  and an artesunate treated culture. for each time point explored, cdna from parasites with and without the drug were labeled with different cyanines, mixed and hybridized. to analyse dynamic transcriptome alterations,  <dig> pilot experiments were performed in which rna was harvested at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> minutes and  <dig> hours of incubation with the drug. no significant changes in gene expression could be detected at  <dig> minutes. in contrast, after  <dig> hour incubation time, major transcriptome alterations occurred under artesunate, but their analysis was un-interpretable due to drug-induced massive slowing-down of parasite development . we thus decided to focus on  <dig> drug-exposure time, namely  <dig> minutes and  <dig> hours after drug addition.

since artesunate is active on ring stages as well as on older trophozoite stages, we decided to explore different time points along the erythrocytic cycle and search for genes affected at each time point. therefore,  <dig> drug treatment experiments, staggered between  <dig> hours and  <dig> hours of parasite development, were performed for the comparison of drug versus no drug at  <dig> minutes and  <dig> hours.

transcript changes under artesunate exposure
we looked for genes displaying similar changes across all experiments, with the hypothesis that responses to artesunate would not be stage-dependent within the explored  <dig> hour window of the developmental cycle. the results of  <dig> experiments performed at time points staggered between 20– <dig> hours post-invasion, were analyzed using anova with a holm-bonferroni method of p-value adjustment, p <  <dig> . this led to a list of genes with similar ratios of expression . from this list, only genes differentially expressed at  <dig> hours under artesunate and not after  <dig> hours in the absence of the drug were retained . it is important to stress that what we refer to, for convenience, as over- or under-expression in fact refers to higher or lower steady state rna levels.

due to the high number of microarrays analyzed , power of the statistical analysis was such that expression log ratios as low as +/-  <dig>  could be found for genes that displayed significant changes by anova . this appeared questionable from a biological standpoint and we chose to use a cut-off log-ratio of +/-  <dig> . this value is lower than what is usually  chosen in most transcriptome studies, i.e. +/-  <dig>  but we felt it was justified given the large amount of data analyzed here and the low amplitude of fold-changes reported in previous p. falciparum transcriptome studies  <cit> .

in addition, as genes of potential interest could be differentially expressed in the controls but more-so or differently under artesunate, we needed to identify these and filter out the developmentally regulated gene expression profiles. indeed, the extent to which the drug slowed-down parasite development is unknown. thus, different expression levels in artesunate-exposed vs. control  cultures could reflect the direct effect of artesunate together with a possible difference in growth rate/developmental stage. to identify the developmentally regulated genes in the artesunate-free control culture, the  <dig> hours rna was hybridized against the time  <dig> rna . even within such a short time window,  <dig> genes showed differential expression in the control culture. filtering-out this potential confounding "slowing-down effect" established a second list of genes differentially expressed in the artesunate experiments and in the control experiments, but with significantly different expression-ratios under these two conditions  .

this resulted in the following: out of the  <dig> genes analyzed,  <dig>  were differentially expressed after  <dig> hours in presence of artesunate,  <dig> over-expressed  and  <dig>  under-expressed. of these  <dig> genes differentially expressed at  <dig> hours,  <dig> showed significant expression changes at  <dig> minutes, presumably reflecting an early response to the drug.

our technically demanding and relatively stringent approach may have generated false negatives, but we wanted to be as confident as possible about the list of genes selected as being differentially expressed. this confidence was supported by the results of qrt-pcr performed with  <dig> over-expressed and  <dig> under-expressed genes, which confirmed the microarray data  .

classification of differentially expressed genes
interesting features were observed in the group of differentially expressed genes. for genes expressed differentially at  <dig> hours, there was a strong positive bias in the sub-set of over-expressed genes towards polymorphic genes located in sub-telomeric position and carrying pexel/hct motifs  <cit>  used for export beyond the parasitophorous vacuole into the erythrocyte cytoplasm, or to the red blood cell membrane/surface . this was determined after excluding from the analysis the strain-specific var, stevor and rifin multigene families – which are not adequately represented in our case since the parasite strain used differs from 3d <dig>  concomitant with this positive bias, there was a negative bias towards conserved genes in the over-expressed genes. in contrast, the group of under-expressed genes displayed a positive bias towards conserved genes and a negative bias towards polymorphic genes.

functions  were assigned to  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes  <cit>  . apart from lipid and purine/pyrimidine metabolism, few genes belonged to the metabolic pathways of the parasite . most genes with altered expression under artesunate pressure were related to chaperones, transporters, cell cycle, kinases, zn finger proteins, transcription activating proteins, proteins involved in proteasome degradation, oxidative stress and in cell cycle regulation. a positive bias towards over-expression could be observed for genes related to oxidative stress, kinases, transcription associated proteins and chaperones, and towards under-expression for genes related to proteasome degradation and transporters . slowing down of parasite development may be linked to the differential expression of three genes involved in cell cycle regulation . two genes were over-expressed, namely pff <dig> encoding a putative rna binding protein mei <dig> homologue and pfl <dig> encoding a putative cell cycle control protein, while pfa0345w, encoding a putative centrin, was under-expressed.

oxidative stress
oxidative stress is likely to occur in parasites submitted to artesunate, whether linked to the direct action of the drug or to the reduced capacity of the damaged parasite to inactivate free radicals. the antioxidant defense in p. falciparum involves both the glutathione and the thioredoxin system, the relative contribution of each remaining unknown  <cit> . four genes involved in the parasite antioxidant defense  <cit> , showed altered transcription profiles  : gamma glutamyl cystein synthetase and glutathione synthetase  were over-expressed. in contrast, the genes encoding protein disulfide isomerase related protein  and glutathione peroxidase  were under-expressed. the consecutive action of gamma glutamyl synthetase and glutathione synthetase leads to the production of reduced glutathione , which plays a pivotal role in the antioxidant defense through maintenance of the red-ox state of protein -sh moeties, the reduction of the noxious hydrogen and lipid peroxides and the extrusion of toxic compounds   <cit> . the predicted outcome of the over-expression of these  <dig> genes would be an increased supply of gsh in response to the oxidative stress induced by artesunate.

chaperones, protein trafficking and related genes
genome mining on parasite chaperone analogues has led to the conclusion that approximately 2% of the p. falciparum genes encoded potential or confirmed chaperones  <cit> . chaperone proteins have diverse functions, such as serving as transcription factors, regulating the cell cycle, being involved in protein degradation, binding damaged proteins, protein transport across membranes and protein folding. as expected in a parasite under severe injury,  <dig> genes encoding chaperone or chaperone-related proteins  were found up-regulated at  <dig> hours of artesunate pressure, among which pfhsp <dig>  pfhsp <dig> and  <dig> genes belonging to the hsp <dig> chaperone machinery of p. falciparum  <cit> . the first four were already over-expressed at  <dig> minutes, along with pfd0080c  and thus can be considered part of the early response to the drug. interestingly, most , chaperone-encoding genes up-regulated under artesunate have potential export signals, suggesting possible export of their corresponding proteins from the parasite to the erythrocyte cytoplasm or membrane. chaperone involvement in trafficking of membrane or exported proteins has been highlighted in a recent analysis of the parasite chaperone network  <cit> . in particular, analysis of the interactome suggested that a member of the hsp <dig> family , which interacts with pfhsp <dig>  and pfhsp <dig>  could function as a co-chaperone in the hsp <dig> complex of the parasite to transport eythrocyte membrane exported proteins such as antigen  <dig> . it is remarkable to note that pf14_ <dig>  pf08_ <dig>  pf07_ <dig> and pf11_ <dig> were all over-expressed under artesunate pressure . this suggests artesunate-triggered altered intracellular trafficking, contributing to remodeling of the parasitized erythrocyte membrane, a conclusion further substantiated by the observed increased steady state levels of genes encoding proteins interacting with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton such as mesa , several members of the resa family and number of genes carrying pexel/ht motifs. alterations of the intracellular trafficking is also suggested by altered transcription profiles of genes such as signal peptidase  as well as transporters, including organellar importers .

transporters
eleven genes involved in transport were under-expressed . the putative udp galactose antiporter  down-regulated at  <dig> hours, was the only transporter found down-regulated at  <dig> minutes, suggesting that alteration of its transcript levels is an early event. four subunits of the vacuolar atp synthase were under-expressed. this constitutes one of the few cases of concommittant regulation of individual components of a specific machinery or pathway in this study, suggesting that indeed the activity of the vacuolar atp synthase was severely impaired. this enzyme contributes to acidification of vacuolar and organelle contents.

only  <dig> genes encoding transporters were over-expressed, amongst which pfmdr <dig> , the p-glycoprotein homologue of p. falciparum, which modulates susceptibility to antimalarial drugs such as quinine, mefloquine and artemisinins  <cit> . an association has been shown in the field between sensitivity to arylaminoalcohols or endoperoxides, pfmdr <dig> allelic status and gene copy number  <cit> , suggesting that an over-expressed functional pfmdr <dig> conferred a multidrug resistance like phenotype  <cit> . over-expression of pfmdr <dig> we show to occur under artesunate pressure may have an impact on susceptibility to the drug associated to artemisinins upon act administration. it also suggests that not only gene copy number but also gene transcription rates and mrna stability should be monitored when exploring mechanisms of field parasite drug resistance.

genes were selected based on  <cit> .

p. falciparum contains an unusually high number of acyl coa synthases  and binding proteins that might play a role in fatty acid salvage and transport from the host cell  <cit> . amongst the  <dig> different acs genes, a non subtelomeric acyl coa synthetase gene pfb0685c has expanded into a family of  <dig> duplicated genes mainly located in the subtelomeric regions of the genome and transcribed during the erythrocytic stage of the parasite. at least two acs proteins pfacs <dig>  and pfacs <dig>  were shown to interact with ankyrin through their lysine-rich c-terminal domain  <cit> . similar domains are only present in the genes of this family, possibly targeting these enzymes to the erythrocyte cytoplasm and/or membrane, an interesting possibility as all the acs proteins have a signal peptide but are devoid of the pexel/ht motif. this would contribute to the capacity of p. falciparum to activate fatty acid scavenged from the plasma or the erythrocyte membrane, a critical metabolic function for the survival of the parasite. all  <dig> acs genes over-expressed under artesunate  belong to this family.

two acyl-coa binding protein genes, pf08_ <dig> and pf10_ <dig>  were under-expressed. pf14_ <dig>  an acetyl coa carboxylase which generates malonyl-coa, likely to be located in the apicoplast  <cit> , was already found over-expressed at  <dig> minutes. interestingly, the triose phosphate transporter located in the outermost membrane of the apicoplast, pfe0410w, was under-expressed under artesunate. this transporter, also called pfotpt, fuels the apicoplast by providing carbon, reducing power and atp  <cit> , but also quite importantly, dihydroxyacetone phosphate , the precursor needed for isoprenoid and for phospholipids biosynthesis  <cit> . altogether these data suggest an alteration of fatty acid metabolism both intracellularly and in the apicoplast.

mitochondrial genes and genes encoding proteins targeted to the mitochondrion
the main metabolic function allowed by the active mitochondrial electron transport chain maintained by plasmodium is regeneration of ubiquinone, which is required as the electron acceptor for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an essential enzyme for pyrimidine biosynthesis  <cit> . indeed,  <dig> important genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport are under-expressed in presence of artesunate:  <dig> subunits of the cytochrome c oxydase  coxi and coi and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein, pf14_ <dig> . this interference with the electron transport chain could in turn affect pyrimidine biosynthesis.

pfc0975c encoding a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-type belonging to the chaperone network of the mitochondrial matrix  <cit>  is under-expressed in response to artesunate. cyclophilin d/peptidylprolyl isomerase activity is a regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition, a non selective inner-membrane permeabilization occuring in response to increased calcium load and redox stress. these  <dig> conditions are induced by artesunate. such a phenomenon can lead to necrosis through activation of phospholipases, proteases and nucleases  <cit> .

purine/pyrimidine metabolism
in addition to the possibly impaired respiratory chain interfering with pyrimidine synthesis, expression of other genes related to purine/pyrimidine biosynthesis was also modified by artesunate pressure : cytidine and deoxycytidylate deaminase  hypoxanthine phophorybosyl transferase , deoxyuridine 5'triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase  and uridine phosphorylase  are all under-expressed, while dihydroorotase  is over-expressed. interference with such key metabolic processes may readily cause parasite death.

signaling/kinases
the kinome of p. falciparum is atypical, with an atypical map kinase family and a particular r45-fikk kinase family  <cit> .

fourteen genes encoding kinases, some of which potentially related to signal transduction, were differentially expressed in presence of artesunate . four of the  <dig> over-expressed genes were already differentially expressed at  <dig> minutes, among which the calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase  <dig>  pfpk <dig> . pfpk <dig> belongs to the camk group of p. falciparum kinases, a family of kinases which can be activated in response to increased calcium levels, possibly resulting from specific inhibition of the serca pfatpase <dig> by the drug  <cit> . the other  <dig> genes with increased expression levels at  <dig> minutes were members of the r45-fikk multigene family  <cit> . this apicomplexa-specific kinase gene family is composed of  <dig> genes all presenting sub-telomeric positions, scattered over  <dig> chromosomes. it has recently been shown that these kinases localize in different compartments of the infected erythrocyte, some being associated with the erythrocyte membrane  <cit> . under artesunate pressure,  <dig> members of the r45-fikk family were over-expressed at  <dig> minutes  and remained at elevated levels subsequently, while two additional r45-fikk kinases displayed increased transcript levels at  <dig> hours, namely pfd1165w and pf11_ <dig>  all  <dig> present export motifs. pfd1165w and pfl0040c are associated with maurer's clefts, and pfl0040c with the infected erythrocyte membrane as well  <cit> .

transcription associated proteins; zinc finger genes
transcriptome studies of parasites during the erythrocytic stages of development have shown that in many cases, transcription is soon followed by translation, when the parasite "needs" the considered proteins to further develop  <cit> . in contrast, comparison between transcriptomic and proteomic studies have shown the existence of discrepancies in rna and protein expression for about 50% of the genes expressed during the erythrocytic development  <cit> . this has been clearly confirmed for certain genes, such as var genes transcribed at the early ring stage and translated several hours later  <cit>  or a series of sexual stage proteins the corresponding genes of which are transcribed long before translation occurs  <cit> . genome mining revealed that relatively few genes  encode transcription associated proteins  <cit> . six non-zn finger transcription associated protein genes, as defined by coulson  <cit> , were over-expressed under artesunate,  <dig> were under-expressed . this relatively low number suggests that transcriptional regulation may not play a major role in gene-expression modulation under drug-induced stress. altered decay rates may modulate gene expression in drug-exposed parasites and contribute to the dynamic changes of mrna levels observed here. in this regard, it is worth noting the recently outlined decreasing rna decay rate as the parasite matures. a list of genes encoding putative decay components and possibly contributing to such a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation in p.falciparum has been proposed  <cit> . however, there was no observed effect of artesunate on expression of these genes.

discussion
the methodology adopted here allowed us to find reproducible alterations of the transcriptome in p. falciparum parasites under artesunate pressure. to overcome the major hurdle of developmentally regulated genes, we combined the use of a fast acting drug at high dose with limited incubation time at  <dig> successive but synchronized developmental stages. most observed alterations were of low amplitude, possibly reflecting particular mechanisms of gene regulation in malaria parasites. this resulted in a relatively broad pertubation, that nevertheless was highly significant and consistent across experiments. we did not detect altered expression of a single specific metabolic pathway or of the putative drug target molecules but several functionally important groups of genes exhibited interesting dynamic changes. within the intrinsic limitations of all transcriptome studies , the overall picture that emerges from our current analysis of the transcriptome changes suggests i) pertubation of the intracellular trafficking and organisation, including changes in chaperones, transporters, remodeling the erythrocyte space beyond the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane up to the membrane of the infected erythrocyte; ii) probable down-phasing of metabolism as deduced from down-regulation of key enzymes/transporters implicated in purine, pyrimidine and isoprenoid synthesis; iii) an altered mitochondrion; iv) an altered redox homeostasis and possibly altered protein turnover. in addition, the transcriptome analysis highlighted numerous genes with unknown function, annotated as coding for hypothetical proteins . some display consistent high and early up-regulation and clearly deserve further investigation.

the physiological significance of the observed perturbations need to be assessed in future studies. transcriptome analysis is the first of a multi-step process, to be followed by scrutiny of the role of the individual genes identified here. in particular, it will be essential to establish whether or not the genes in question are implicated in a rate-limiting process and to analyse the dynamics of the corresponding protein products, including their turnover, post-translational modifications and cellular localization. an important question is to clarifiy which transcriptome alterations are specific to the response to artemisinins and which are related to a parasite lethally injured, as this has numerous implications for drug development.

we will discuss the transcriptome data in the frame of existing knowledge on mechanisms of action of artemisinin derivatives and mechanisms resulting in reduced susceptibility/resistance. we will next discuss possible common changes in steady state rna levels after different stresses inflicted to the parasite such as exposure to 41°c or treatment with chloroquine, that can cause parasite death.

the mechanism of action of artemisinins is debated. artemisinin are endoperoxide-containing sesquiterpene lactones. fe++-dependent activation of the endoperoxide bridge is required for the drug to be active  <cit> . cleavage of the endoperoxide moiety forms highly reactive oxyl radicals that rearrange to more stable carbon-centered radical intermediates. these in turn form covalent adducts with parasite products thought to be responsible for a pleiotropic effect of the drug. such pleiotropicity may explain the variety of genes we show here to be affected in their expression. recent evidence suggest more specific mechanisms, such as inhibition of specific targets, with specific inhibition of the p. falciparum serca-type ca++ pump   <cit> . importantly, field isolates with markedly reduced in vitro susceptibility to artemether presented a mutant serca-type pfatpase <dig>  <cit> . artemisinin has been shown to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum – located serca-type in toxoplasma gondii, a related apicomplexan parasite as well  <cit> . we did not observe altered steady state levels of pfatpase <dig> mrna at any time point investigated, indicating that over-expression of this gene is not part of the parasite response to artesunate.

ultrastructural alterations of the morphology and their kinetics are debated as well. early-stage alterations of the mitochondrion, the endothelial reticulum and the digestive vacuole were detected in some studies  <cit>  but not others  <cit> . some of the transcriptome alterations may account for a disorganisation of the digestive vacuole and the mitochondrion. we observed increased levels of pfmdr <dig> expression concomitant with decreased mrna levels of four of the subunits of the h+ vacuolar atpase, which is implicated in regulating calcium intracellular stores of acidic compartments. downproduction of the h+ vacuolar atpase and/or alteration of its subunit ratio is predicted to negatively impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis. this is most probably on the critical path, since disruption of calcium homeostasis is central to cellular death, necrosis endophagy and apoptosis. our transcriptome analysis also shows evidence that artesunate interferes with expression of genes related to the mitochondrion, in most cases by down-regulating their steady state rna levels. this calls for additional studies on the mitochondrial activity after artesunate exposure.

additional factors are to be considered in light of the transcriptome data, in particular the intracellular partitioning of the drug. several studies have demonstrated the selective uptake of artemisinin derivatives. it has been shown that artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin, two sesquiterpene endoperoxide drugs closely related to artesunate, are transported by the tubulovesicular network  formed within the erythrocyte cytoplasm for nutrient import to the parasite, and that these drugs disrupted the protein organization of the tvn  <cit> . numerous genes implicated in intracellular space modelling, trafficking, chaperones and transport display altered transcription profiles in artesunate-treated parasites. the markedly bias for such genes was indeed the most salient observation of our transcriptome study. it is tempting to speculate that this results in remodelling the intracellular space, including remodelling of the infected red blood cell membrane and tvn. this could either be a response aimed at correcting drug-inflicted damage, preventing further intake of drug or reflect the dysfunction resulting from such damage. protein trafficking is all the more important for parasite growth and survival that the parasite develops inside a parasitophorous vacuole within the erythrocyte cytoplasm. interactions between the parasite and the erythrocyte are multiple, with an increasing number of parasite proteins recognized as being involved . parasite-induced modifications of the red blood cell through interactions of parasite proteins exported to the host cell membrane or cytoskeleton play a major role in parasite survival and virulence, through induction of infected red cell cytoadhesive properties or decreased deformability. altered transcript levels of genes involved in host cell remodelling and intracellular trafficking have been reported in parasites lethally damaged by exposure to febrile temperatures  <cit> . this suggests that perturbing intracellular trafficking/remodeling is either on the path to parasite death or an attempt to overcome a lethal injury. this also suggests that alterations of intracellular trafficking by artesunate may be one of the mechanisms through which the drug can be active on a wide range of parasite developmental stages.

analysis of the proteome of artemether-treated p. falciparum parasites showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins identified using a maldi-tof-ms-based analysis  <cit> , displayed a greater than three-fold expression level compared to untreated control cultures. two of the over-expressed proteins, namely hsp <dig> , pf14_ <dig>  also presented an increased transcript level in our study. direct comparison of both studies is precluded due to limitations such as different sensitivities of the transcriptome and proteome approaches, more comprehensive coverage of the expressed products in the transcriptome approach, different drug exposure protocols and/or transcription/translation uncoupling, which has been described for approx 50% of the proteins  <cit> .

to put the alterations observed under artesunate in perspective with changes induced by unrelated forms of stress, we analyzed the data in the light of the transcriptome alterations reported after chloroquine  <cit>  treatment or incubation at 41°c  <cit> , both treatments reported as having led to parasite death. the transcriptome studies are not directly comparable, as they were performed under different experimental conditions  and corresponded to different natures of stress . however, identification of a few genes with altered expression under such different experimental conditions provides interesting insight. such joint analysis is illustrated in the venn diagram . there were only  <dig> genes identified as differentially expressed under all  <dig> types of stress: pfb0095c encoding pfemp <dig>  pfe1245w, encoding a putative zinc finger protein, and pf14_ <dig> encoding a putative rna-binding protein and mal7p <dig>  encoding a hypothetical protein. pfemp <dig> and mal7p <dig>  have an export motif. pfemp <dig> is exported to the cytoplasmic face of the erythrocyte membrane in the mature stages. it associates with the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, which it destabilizes  <cit> . both pfemp <dig> and mal7p <dig>  have been shown to contribute to trafficking of pfemp <dig>  <cit> . their role in the response to lethal stresses deserves to be investigated. characterization of the products encoded by the remaining  <dig> common genes certainly warrants particular attention, as these genes may play a crucial role in the general response to stress.

the transcriptome of chloroquine-treated and artesunate-treated parasites shared three additional altered gene profiles, namely pfe1455w encoding a putative sugar transporter, pfi0095c and pfl0040c both encoding putative kinases belonging to the r45-fikk family. interestingly again, the three predicted proteins have an export motif. however, since there were large inter-experiment variations in the transcriptome analysis of chloroquine-treated parasites, commonalities are probably largely underestimated.

ninety four genes were differentially regulated both under heat shock and artesunate,  <dig> over-expressed and  <dig> under-expressed under both conditions, amongst which members of the r45-fikk kinase family, chaperones, molecules involved in lipid metabolism and number of hypothetical proteins -including as discussed above numerous genes coding for proteins with an export motif. two of the  <dig> r45-fikk kinase genes over-expressed under artesunate were also over-expressed under chloroquine pressure  <cit> . of the  <dig> r45/fikk kinase genes found over-expressed under heat shock, one was also differentially expressed under chloroquine. these data suggest that expression of genes belonging to the r45-fikk kinase family reflects the response of the parasite to different types of environmental modifications and that the parasite response to different natures of stress may include common pathways. the same could be said about genes belonging to  <dig> other families. eight of the  <dig> chaperone/chaperone-related encoding genes over-expressed under artesunate were also over-expressed under heat-shock. of the  <dig> hsp <dig> type p. falciparum chaperones,  <dig> were over-expressed under artesunate,  <dig> in common with heat-shock.

CONCLUSIONS
the rapid parasiticidal activity of artesunate at high doses allowed us to study the effects of the drug on the transcriptome of synchronized parasite cultures over a short  <dig> hour time window. a positive bias was observed in favor of subtelomeric localization, polymorphism and presence of potential export sequences for the subset of upregulated genes. the corresponding genes, related to protein trafficking, kinases or membrane remodeling, often belong to multi-gene families  <cit> . low amplitude transcript level alterations were observed, but the large number of affected genes likely induces substantial perturbations of the interface between the parasite and its host cellular environment. whether these constitute parasite survival mechanisms or in contrast metabolic cytotoxic alterations remains to be established. the transcriptome analysis identified what may represent pathways leading to parasite death, such as inhibition of purine/pyrimidine metabolism, interference with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, with protein turn-over or with the integrity of the food vacuole and calcium stores.

the high proportion of over-expressed genes encoding proteins exported from the parasite highlight the importance of extra-parasitic compartments as fields for exploration in drug research which, to date, has mostly focused on the parasite within its plasma membrane rather than within its intra- and extra-erythrocytic environment.
