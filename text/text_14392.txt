BACKGROUND
biological systems, such as cell signalling pathways, act sensing input stimuli , and transmitting, processing and integrating this information to provide output signals able to regulate many essential cellular activities. alterations in such information processing capability play a crucial role in the development of a disease state in many cell types  <cit> .

mathematical models are often used to understand the functioning of biological systems, thus providing a description of the behaviour of the system and allowing useful analysis of its emerging properties  <cit> . moreover, mathematical models are powerful tools for data simulation and can be used in combinations with experimental approaches to guide the experimental design, whereas data collected from experiments may help validating and refining the computational models  <cit> .

signalling pathways are usually modelled using ordinary differential equations , able to quantitatively describe the dynamics of the chemical species, in terms of mass action law and kinetic rate constants related to the speed of the chemical reactions occurring among the interacting species  <cit> . as a simpler alternative, logic-based models  <cit>  have been also used. a detailed description of a signalling pathway requires including site-specific details of protein-protein interactions, since signalling proteins contain multiple functional domains and several sites of post-translational modifications. however, protein-protein interactions potentially generate a multiplicity of distinct chemical species, an issue referred to as “combinatorial complexity”  <cit> . adopting odes to represent such complexity would require using a number of state variables equal to the number of possible protein modifications, thus making model specification tedious and error-prone.

in order to deal with the combinatorial complexity of signalling pathways, a novel approach for model specification known as rule-based modelling , has been introduced in the past years, able to deal with the description of all molecular interactions in a more efficient and compact way . rbm is based on the key assumption of “modularity”, i.e. the assumption that molecular interactions only depend on local properties of the proteins  <cit> . according to this assumption, classes of reactions involving the same components are defined by means of a “rule” and are associated with the same rate law. models specified using rbm can then be used for simulation using a number of different population-based or particle-based methods  <cit> . in particular, the rules specified can be used to automatically generate a system of odes, which can then be simulated  <cit> .

an impressive example of the power of rbm is represented by the specification of the epidermal growth factor  receptor signalling, in which the interaction among  <dig> distinct chemical species was codified by the use of only  <dig> rules  <cit> . as a more recent example, the specification of the complex erbb receptor signalling network required  <dig> rules accounting for  <dig> proteins, over  <dig> protein domains, several linear motifs, and  <dig> sites of lipid and protein phosphorylation  <cit> .

an important advantage of rbm resides in its modularity, which facilitates the integration of different pathways, as well as the model extension, when new knowledge becomes available.

in this work, we present a model of the insulin signalling pathway , based on rbm. isp is one of the most important signalling network, which regulates some fundamental biological functions such as glucose and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. these different biological responses are achieved by the insulin binding to its receptor and by the subsequent combined activation of three major pathways:. the pi3k-akt pathway, mostly responsible for the metabolic insulin action via the translocation of the glucose transporter type  <dig>  vesicles to the plasma membrane, which, in turn, allow the glucose uptake in muscle cells and adipocytes  <cit> ;

. the tsc1/2-mtor pathway, playing a critical role in protein synthesis since mammalian target of rapamycin  is a central controller for several anabolic and catabolic processes including rna translation, ribosome biogenesis and autophagy, in response not only to growth factors and hormones like insulin, but also to nutrients, energy and stress signals  <cit> ;

. the ras-mapk pathway, promoting cell survival, division and motility via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig>  complex that, once phosphorylated, translocates into the nucleus activating many transcription factors, thus constituting an important connection between the cytoplasmic and nuclear events  <cit> .



several mathematical models of isp have been published in the last 10 years, focused on different aspects of insulin regulation, including: insulin binding to its receptor  <cit> ; insulin receptor autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of its substrate together with receptor cycling and endocytosis  <cit> ; insulin signalling in insulin resistance state in human adipocytes  <cit> ; translocation of glut <dig> glucose transporter  <cit> ; regulation of mtor  <cit> ; joint regulation of insulin and amino acids  <cit> ; crosstalk with epidermal growth factor  signalling and the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit> .

in this work, we adapted and integrated the information provided by three published models  <cit>  to implement, up-to our knowledge, the most comprehensive model of the isp. the three above listed models describe, using odes, the pi3k-akt, the mtor and the ras-mapk pathway, respectively, thus covering most of the essential regulatory mechanisms characterizing the isp. the rbm approach was used to implement our isp model. this was then partially validated by comparing the model predictions with measurements of some phosphorylated proteins involved in isp, such as pakt-s <dig>  pperk1/2-t202-y <dig> and pmtor-s <dig>  the model was then used as an in silico tool to predict the profiles of all the chemical species during insulin perturbation and to analyse, by means of parametric sensitivity analysis  <cit> , the role of negative feedback loops in controlling the robustness of the system.

RESULTS
the model of insulin signalling pathway
starting from three published models  <cit> , we implemented the model of isp as depicted in fig.  <dig> using the systems biology graphical notation  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the model of insulin signalling pathway. the model of insulin signaling pathway obtained by integrating the pi3k-akt pathway, the mtor pathway and the ras-mapk pathway, depicted using the systems biology graphical notation. coloured nodes resemble the clustering results obtained on simulated profiles . coloured lines represent important feedback mechanisms; namely: the red line represents the p70s6k-irs <dig> negative feedback loop, the blue line the erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loop



the model comprises many of the essential elements responsible for the insulin action since the three major sub-pathways of the isp, briefly described in the following, are included.

the pi3k-akt pathway
for the pi3k-akt pathway, we mostly refer to the model in sedaghat et al.  <cit> . the model has been used by several research groups and includes many of the most known signalling components mediating the translocation of glucose transporter glut <dig>  these include the insulin receptor binding and recycle subsystems; the post-receptor signalling subsystem including both ser- and tyr- phosphorylation at the insulin receptor substrate <dig> ; the formation of a complex  between phosphorylated irs <dig> and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase ; the phosphatidylinositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphates pip <dig>  synthesis; the phosphorylation of protein kinase b  and protein kinase c -ζ; the translocation of glut <dig> to the plasma membrane. protein tyrosine phosphatase  and lipid phosphatases  effects are also considered in the model.

the tsc1/2-mtor pathway
for the tsc1/2-mtor pathway we mostly refer to the model recently published in sonntag et al.  <cit> , describing the mtor effect in response to insulin and amino acids. the model considers both mtor complexes: mtorc <dig> and mtorc <dig>  mtorc <dig> activation is dependent on the presence of amino acids and is inhibited by the tuberous sclerosis proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  activation , which, in turn, depends on the 5′ amp-activated protein kinase  activation. ampk activation depends on irs <dig> tyr phosphorylation, whereas tsc1/ <dig> inhibition  depends on akt phosphorylation at thr <dig>  mtorc <dig>  which was recently identified as the unknown phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase  <dig> , i.e. the kinase responsible for ser <dig> phosphorylation of akt , contributes to the double phosphorylation of akt together with thr <dig> phosphorylation, operated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase  <dig> . sonntag et al.  <cit>  formulate the hypothesis of the presence of a pi3k variant, which is directly regulated by the activated insulin receptor and, in turn, activates mtorc <dig>  we included this hypothesis in our model.

the ras-mapk pathway
for the ras-mapk pathway, we mostly refer to the model in borisov et al.  <cit> , describing both egf and insulin stimulations. the model includes all the main chemical mechanisms involved in the ras-mapk pathway: the interaction of tyr phosphorylated irs <dig> with shp <dig>  and grb2-sos complex , thus forming the shp2-irs <dig> and grb2/sos-irs <dig> complexes, respectively; the gtp- binding of ras; the phosphorylation of raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase ; the interaction of insulin receptor with ras gtpase activating protein , which in turn catalyses the reverse process of ras deactivation; the activation of the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase src which fully activates c-raf; the dual specificity mitogen-activated kinase 1/ <dig> ; the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases .

integration of the pi3k-akt, the tsc1/2-mtor and the ras-mapk pathways
the pi3k-akt, tsc1/2-mtor and ras-mapk pathways contain several overlapping parts, which, in the original papers, were often modelled in different ways being based on slightly different assumptions. we compared the overlapping reactions across different models and implemented the most up-to-date version of them based on the current knowledge of cellular biochemistry. moreover, the integration of the three models required dealing with the different measurement units adopted to describe the state variables. whereas immunoblot experiments permit to obtain important information concerning the timescale of signalling events, quantitative information about protein expression are often problematic to retrieve so that the predicted concentration profiles are sometimes reported in micromolar concentration, as in borisov et al.  <cit> , or in arbitrary units , as in sonntag et al.  <cit> . in contrast, in sedaghat et al.  <cit> , concentration were expressed either in molar units or in percentage of total concentration .

potentially, rbm allows performing both deterministic and stochastic simulations, provided that variables quantities are expressed in copies of molecules per cell. even if in the present work we did not use stochastic simulation, we aligned all the variables to the same unit, i.e. number of molecules per cells, by multiplying the molar units by na*v . all details about unit conversion from au and percentage concentrations are given in material and methods.

the resulting model consists of  <dig> reaction rules and  <dig> parameters encoding the interactions among  <dig> distinct chemical species. reactions, parameter values and initial conditions are all reported in the additional file  <dig> 

novelties of the rbm-isp model
the rbm implementation, facilitated accounting for a number of the isp features, such as the phosphorylation of signalling proteins at multiple sites and with multiple effects, the simultaneous interaction of molecules with different binding partners and the subcellular localization of some reactions. the above listed characteristics are discussed in details in the following.

phosphorylation of signalling proteins on multiple sites
signalling molecules may have different levels of activity, depending on which residues are phosphorylated. consider for example irs <dig> and akt. irs <dig> has many residues potentially involved in post-translational modifications and can be activated or inhibited in its kinase action, depending on the phosphorylated residue being tyr or ser  <cit> . for instance, tyr- <dig> phosphorylation is required for pi3k, shp <dig> and grb <dig> binding, whereas ser- <dig> phosphorylation by p70s6k is a mechanism related to insulin resistance  <cit> . akt, in contrast, can be activated by phosphorylation at thr <dig> or ser <dig> by pdk <dig> and mtorc <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

irs <dig> phosphorylation dependent activation/inhibition was already included in sedeghat model although considering ser phosphorylation regulated by pkc and not by p70s6k, as in sonntag model. here we modelled both pkc and p70s6k actions and described pirs1-tyr <dig> complex formation/dissociation with pi3k  <cit> , shp <dig> and grb <dig>  <cit> .

the two phosphorylation sites of akt were not explicitly modelled in sedaghat et al.  <cit> . we modelled the akt phosphorylation at thr mediated by pip <dig> as in sedaghat et al. model and the akt phosphorylation at ser mediated by mtorc <dig> as in sonntag et al. model and assumed:i) akt phosphorylated either at thr or both sites to act on tsc1/ <dig> complex by mediating its phosphorylation at tyr and dephosphorylation at ser  <cit> ;

ii) akt phosphorylation at ser or both sites to inactivate c-raf  <cit> ;

iii) akt phosphorylation at either thr or ser to activate glut <dig> translocation  <cit> .



interaction with multiple binding partners
the interaction of the molecules in the signalling pathways with numerous different binding partners results in the potential formation of different complexes. in isp, irs <dig> phosphorylated at tyr- <dig> can bind pi3k as modelled in sedaghat et al.  <cit>  or grb2/sos and shp <dig>  as modelled in borisov et al.  <cit> . in order to match the rbm-isp model specification with the current knowledge, we allowed the formation of different complexes. thus, irs <dig> can bind in a mutually exclusive way grb2/sos and shp <dig>  but can bind simultaneously grb2/sos and the p <dig> regulatory subunit of pi3k  <cit> .

information about subcellular localization in reaction rules
the possibility that proteins have to interact is often related to their physical localization, i.e. their presence in the extra-cellular space, cytoplasm, nucleus, plasma membrane, etc. for instance, lipids pip <dig> function as plasma membrane docking sites that recruit different proteins containing pleckstrin homology  domains  and their co-localization can accelerate specific signalling events  <cit> . another example is the interaction of mtorc <dig> with the ras homologue enriched in brain  and rag family on lysosome membrane, reported by zoncu et al.  <cit> . in our model, we included the information about subcellular localization for the insulin receptor and glut <dig> transporter, distinguishing between their plasmatic and cytoplasmic localization according to the mathematical description given by sedaghat et al.  <cit> .

model predictions
the concentration profiles of all the chemical species populating the model were simulated upon 60 min,  <dig> nm insulin stimulation. the  <dig> nm concentration represents a well-accepted level of insulin stimulation in cell cultures commonly found in the literature  <cit>  and used also by our group  <cit> . according to sonntag et al.  <cit> , we also assumed a constant amino acids stimulation, necessary to obtain the mtorc <dig> activation and the feedback of p70s6k on irs <dig>  to assess the model reliability, model predictions were compared with experimental data available in our dataset for some phosphoproteins at time  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 60 min following insulin plus amino acids, i.e. leucine, stimulation  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the experimental and predicted profiles of pakt-s <dig> and pmtorc1-s <dig> are in good agreement, since they both show an increasing phosphorylation pattern reaching a steady state in the first 2– <dig> min and 20– <dig> min, respectively. the predicted profile for pperk1/2-y <dig> y <dig> is confirmed by experimental data in the first 10 min, whereas in the last time points it decreases rapidly in experimental data with respect to model predictions. the profile observed in experimental data for pperk1/2-y <dig> y <dig>  might be more closely matched by augmenting the strength of the feedback between pperk1/2-y <dig> y <dig> and grb2/sos. in fig.  <dig> , the simulated profile of pperk1/2-y <dig> y <dig> obtained by multiplying the parameter kcat <dig>  by a factor of  <dig> is shown. note that in the rbm isp model available online, we decided to leave the parameter of the model unchanged, i.e. we use the value from the literature  <cit> , postponing parameter optimization for future studies, when further data will be available. unfortunately, the experimental data of pp70s6k-t <dig> were not reliable , so we cannot compare the experimental and simulated profiles for this protein, which is an endpoint of the pathway with an important feedback action on irs <dig>  nevertheless, the simulated profile shown in fig.  <dig>  resembles experimental data shown in other papers  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison between simulated and experimental data. comparison between experimental concentration  and normalized model predictions  for pakt-s <dig>  pperk1/ <dig>  pmtor-s <dig> and pp70s6k-t <dig>  the profile of pperk1/2-y <dig> y <dig> obtained by increasing the strength of the feedback between erk and grb2/sos is shown in dotted lines. values are reported for experimental data of human skeletal muscle cells  exposed to ebss +  <dig> nm insulin at time 0′, 2′, 5′, 10′, 30′, and 60′. all measurements were taken in three biological replicated, and for each biological replicates, three technical replicated measurements were taken. all data are expressed in arbitrary units  and rescaled between  <dig> and  <dig> for sake of comparison



we the examined the predicted profiles of all the active species and clustered them in four clusters according to their dynamic behaviour, as shown in fig. 3:fig.  <dig> clustering of simulated profiles. four clusters were identified for the predicted profiles of the active species, according to their dynamic behaviour: 1) fast response reaching the steady state within 2– <dig> min ; 2) fast overshooting responses reaching a peak within 2– <dig> min and descending to a steady state after 10– <dig> min ; 3) slow response reaching the steady state in 10– <dig> min ; 4) slow overshooting responses reaching a peak in 5– <dig> min and descending to a steady state in 30– <dig> min 

fast response, reaching the steady state within 2– <dig> min 

fast overshooting response, reaching the peak within 2– <dig> min and then the steady state after 10– <dig> min 

slow response, reaching the steady state in 10– <dig> min 

slow overshooting responses, reaching the peak in 5– <dig> min and the steady state in 30– <dig> min .



following insulin stimulation, the insulin receptor responds rapidly by phosphorylating and triggering a cascade of events along distinct pathways. along the pi3k-akt pathway, all mechanisms tightly related to irs <dig> tyr- phosphorylation are characterized by a fast response. the same is true for other direct targets of irs <dig> phosphorylated at tyr along the tsc1/2-mtor cascade, i.e. ampk phosphorylation at t <dig>  shp2-irs <dig> and grb2/sos-irs <dig> complexes formation. the fast response is characterized by either a rapid rise to the steady state or by a transient overshoot followed by the steady state condition, depending on the absence/presence of feedback mechanisms acting on the target molecule . mechanisms mostly constituting the tsc1/2-mtor pathway and playing a role in ser- phosphorylation of irs <dig> are characterized by a relatively slow not-overshooting response . as observed above, the ras-mapk pathway assumes in its upstream components a rapid response, which becomes noticeably slower for the downstream ones .

in general, molecules downstream the pathway, related to relatively slow processes such as transcription activation or interaction with the environment outside the cell, such as erk1/ <dig> and glut <dig>  are characterized by slow response whereas molecules upstream the pathway are characterized by a fast response so to elicit a rapid signal propagation. in this context, the overshooting response followed by the return to a steady state might help to achieve a rapid signal propagation on one signalling route, making molecules again available for other signalling routes immediately after.

model predictions in absence of control mechanisms
a number of simulations were then performed to investigate the robustness of the system on two target effects of isp: glut <dig> translocation and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation. in particular, the role of two major control mechanisms in regulating the target effects was analysed:p70s6k-irs <dig> negative feedback loop ;

erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loop ;



to this purpose, the time course of glut <dig> and erk1/ <dig> response in presence and absence of the two regulatory mechanisms listed above was compared . the dynamic of doubly phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> is strongly affected by both p70s6k-irs <dig> and erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loops. on the other hand, the steady state and dynamic behaviour of glut <dig> in membrane are not affected by erk1/ <dig>  but are strongly affected by p70s6k-irs <dig> negative feedback loop, thus confirming the remarkable importance of this latter control mechanism in determining the system dynamics.fig.  <dig> simulated pperk1/2-t202-y <dig>  and glut <dig> membrane concentration  profiles upon  <dig> nm insulin stimulation, with the complete model , the model without p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback  and the model without the erk1/2-gs feedback . this latter does not affect glut <dig> membrane concentration; therefore glut <dig> simulated profiles with and without the erk1/2-gs feedback are superimposable



it is well known that insulin resistance is associated with defects in irs-dependent signalling, implicating its dysregulation in the initiation and progression of metabolic disease. an emerging view is that the positive/negative regulation of irs by autologous pathways is subverted in disease by increased basal and other temporally inappropriate serine/threonine phosphorylations  <cit> , which lead to a reduced glucose uptake. compensatory hyperinsulinaemia may rise at this point and lead, ultimately, to diabetes. although irs <dig>  are regulated through a complex mechanism involving phosphorylation of more than  <dig> different serine/threonine residues, in our model p70s6k-irs <dig> negative feedback loop seems essential for a good control of glucose uptake. enhancement of p70s6k-irs <dig> negative feedback loop is able to explain a reduced insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake . similarly , brännmark et al.  <cit> , using a minimal model of insulin signalling, show that a decreased positive feedback mechanism is able to explain a reduced glucose uptake.fig.  <dig> simulated glut <dig> membrane concentration at 60 min upon different insulin stimulation, with the complete model , the model without p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback  and the model with enhanced p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback, obtained by increasing parameter k <dig> by 100 % of its vaue 



on the other hand, both p70s6k-irs <dig> and erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loops seem essential to guarantee that doubly phosphorylated erk shows a transient behaviour, with a peak at 10 min followed by a return to the baseline condition. this behaviour has already been reported in the literature under insulin stimulus and under epidermal growth factor stimulus  <cit> . a transient erk response prevents a sustained activation of erk that would result in continual cell proliferation  <cit> .

sensitivity analysis
to further investigate the role of the two major control mechanisms in regulating the target effects, local sensitivity analysis was performed by applying a small perturbation  to one model parameter at a time and evaluating the resulting relative changes of glut <dig> translocation and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation . tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the sensitivity coefficients of the model parameters, ranked accordingly to their absolute value and compared to the value the coefficients assume upon removal of p70s6k-irs <dig> and erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loops. these coefficients measure the overall effect, i.e. during the observation window, of a parameter change on the outcome, i.e. glut <dig> and erk response. positive/negative values mean that increasing the parameter value has the effect of enhancing/reducing the response. since small absolute values mean that the parameter changes do not significantly affect the outcome, in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  only coefficient greater than  <dig>  % , either in the original or modified model, are reported.table  <dig> parametric sensitivity analysis of the complete model for glut <dig> membrane translocation

sensitivity coefficients are ranked accordingly to their absolute values and their corresponding values upon p70s6k-irs <dig> and erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loop removal are also shown. only coefficient greater than  <dig>  %  either in the original or modified model are reported. the column “process” describes the biological process to which the parameter takes place

sensitivity coefficients are ranked accordingly to their absolute values and their corresponding values upon p70s6k-irs <dig> and erk1/2-grb2/sos negative feedback loop removal are also shown. only coefficient greater than  <dig>  %  either in the original or modified models are reported. the column “process” describes the biological process to which the parameter takes place



parametric sensitivity analysis of the complete model for glut <dig> response reveals that the most sensitive parameters are related to glut <dig> translocation to plasma membrane, followed by those related to lipid formation and irs1_pi3k complex formation/dissociation. the absence of p70s6k_irs <dig> feedback has a strong impact on augmenting the sensitivity  of parameters related to lipid formation and irs1_pi3k complex formation/dissociation.

parameters related to baseline irs <dig> phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at tyr/ser, have lower sensitivity, which diminishes , in general, by removing p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback, with the exception of parameter k7p, related to irs <dig> phosphorylation at ser. parameters related to pkc mediated irs <dig> phosphorylation at ser also show increased values after removal of p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback. since erk1/2-grb2/sos feedback removal has no effect on glut <dig> translocation, the sensitivity coefficients do not change with and without this feedback.

parametric sensitivity analysis of the complete model for erk1/ <dig> response shows that the most sensitive parameters are related to ras, mek and raf activation and to irs <dig> phosphorylation at tyr and ser, this latter mediated by p70s6k.along both the pi3k-akt and the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway, erk1/2-grb2/sos feedback seems to have an important role on the system robustness. the system dynamics are weakly affected by its absence , whereas the parameter sensitivity increases  in almost all cases if this feedback is removed.

conclusions about the effect of p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback on erk1/ <dig> response are more controversial. removing this feedback has the effect of reducing parameter sensitivity along pi3k_akt pathway, whereas, along ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway, it has almost no effect for parameters related to mek phosphorylation, raf inactivation and erk phosphorylation. it diminishes the sensitivity for parameters related to ras, raf activation and to irs1-grb2/sos and irs1-shp <dig> complex disruption. it strongly augments the sensitivity of parameters related to src and raf activation.

these results highlight the central role of negative feedback loops in determining not only the dynamics of a biological system but also its robustness. this property is of remarkable importance because it preserves the dynamic behaviour of the system against noise and small biological fluctuations commonly due to intercellular variability.

CONCLUSIONS
we implemented a computational model of the isp, including its most important regulatory mechanisms known at present. the model provides a comprehensive description of the system, since it integrates three previously published models  <cit>  addressing distinct aspects of insulin signalling, such as the pi3k-akt pathway, the tsc1/2-mtor pathway, and the ras-erk1/ <dig> pathway.

the model was implemented using the rbm approach, especially suitable for the specification of complex biochemical systems models, such as signalling networks. in particular, we made use of the bionetgen software to provide a clear and compact representation of the chemical species and the reactions populating the system. rbm is based on the key assumption that molecular interactions are “modular”, meaning that the network dynamics is mostly determined by the local properties of the proteins involved in the interactions, and thus the same rate law can be assigned to a defined “class” of reactions. hence, differently from the traditional approach in which a system is directly described by a number of odes equal to the number of possible interactions and transformations of chemical species, in the rbm approach the same system can be described using a reduced number of “rules”. in the case of the isp model here presented, the dynamic of  <dig> distinct chemical species was encoded by only  <dig> rules.

the rbm-isp model was partially validated using experimental data of some of the phosphorylated proteins involved in isp such as pakt-s <dig>  pperk1/2-t202-y <dig>  and pmtor-s <dig>  measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 60 min after insulin stimulation. despite some minor discrepancy at 60 min for pperk1/2-t202-y <dig>  the experimental and predicted profiles are in good agreement.

as already noted in  <cit> , since a wide range of signals, including nutrients, energy levels, growth factors, and amino acids are known to affect insulin signalling pathway, it is likely that experimental results strongly depend on the availability of combinations of the above variables. moreover, the proteins involved in the insulin signalling pathway are known to exhibit a number of different phosphorylation sites, able to interact in different ways with different molecules, a complex set of regulatory mechanisms, which are not yet completely understood. in this respect, our model represents the state of the art knowledge of isp and can be used together with experimental data as a useful simulation tool for the generation of new hypotheses. moreover, since the rbm approach allows, thanks to its modularity, the easy integration of different pathways and the inclusion of new finer details as soon as they become available, our model might constitute a starting point model, ready for the inclusion of new regulatory mechanisms such as those regarding the regulation of irs <dig> through its numerous phosphorylation sites  <cit> . another example of regulatory mechanisms that might be integrated within our model in future studies, is given by yugi et al.  <cit> , in which the authors have reconstructed the insulin signal flow from phosphoproteome and metabolome data and developed a kinetic model of the glycolytic pathway.

besides presenting the rbm-isp model, in this work we showed one of its possible applications in the analysis of network robustness. robustness is a fundamental property that permits to biological systems to preserve their specific functionality despite external and internal perturbations due, respectively, to unpredictable environmental changes and fluctuation of protein concentrations kitano  <cit> . biological robustness is largely related to the network topology and, in particular, to the presence of control mechanisms, such as positive and negative feedback loops  <cit> . in this work, we investigated the role of two negative feedback loops involving p70s6k-irs <dig> and erk1/2-grb2/sos in controlling glut <dig> translocation and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, respectively. the removal of the p70s6k-irs <dig> feedback showed relevant differences in the concentration profiles of both glut <dig> translocation to the cell membrane and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation. removal of the erk1/2-grb2/sos feedback resulted in minor differences in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation. however, the comparison between the original model and the model without the erk1/2-grb2/sos feedback revealed that glut <dig> translocation and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation are more sensitive to changes in the model parameters in the latter case. the reported results highlight how control mechanisms such as negative feedback loops may act in a concealed way, determining some of the fundamental network properties that might not be observed by simple inspection of the system dynamic behaviour, and stress on the need of more and more realistic models and computational tools, able to deal with large-scale simulations and interaction of smaller subnetwork models.
