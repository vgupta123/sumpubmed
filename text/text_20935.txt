BACKGROUND
circadian clocks are molecular oscillators that coordinate metabolism, physiology and behavior of organisms with daily environmental changes  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the robustness of circadian oscillations is dependent on cell-autonomous interconnected transcriptional-translational feedback loops. these circadian oscillators drive rhythmic expression of clock-controlled genes  in various organisms  <cit> . in mammals, the circadian clock coordinates metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and xenobiotic detoxification  <cit> . disruption of the circadian oscillator in mammals is associated with metabolic pathologies, premature aging and cancer  <cit> . in plants, misalignment of the circadian clock with the external light–dark cycle results in lower chlorophyll production and slower growth  <cit> . the mechanisms generating circadian expression rhythms and circadian phase are complex. it is therefore important to identify in a comprehensive manner the genes that are controlled by the circadian clock and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying rhythmic gene expression. gene expression analyses in a variety of organisms suggested that 2% to 15% of their transcriptomes are expressed in a circadian fashion with different phases throughout the day  <cit> . circadian chromatin modifications and transcribing rna polymerase ii  profiles indicate a crucial role of circadian transcription in the orchestration of rhythmic gene expression  <cit> . moreover, recent genome-wide studies in animals suggest that post-transcriptional processes contribute substantially to the generation of rhythmic transcript levels in addition to rhythmic transcription  <cit> .

the white collar complex  is the core transcription activator of the circadian oscillator of neurospora crassa  <cit> . it is composed of two gata type transcription factors, white collar- <dig>  and white collar- <dig>   <cit> . wc <dig> is the main blue-light photo-receptor of neurospora  <cit> . wcc is activated by light and required for the synchronization of the circadian clock with exogenous light–dark cycles  <cit> . most ccgs identified previously had maximum expression levels around dawn, that is, at a time when the wcc is highly active  <cit>  and also at dusk  <cit> . we, in collaboration with colleagues, recently presented evidence that the wcc controls expression of about  <dig> transcription factors  <cit> , which have the potential to transduce circadian information to downstream genes. such second tier circadian transcription factors may generate different phases of circadian gene expression. in particular, the transcription repressor csp <dig>  which is rhythmically expressed with morning-specific peaks in abundance and repressing activity, has the potential to modulate rhythmic expression of several target genes with an evening-specific phase  <cit> .

here, we have compared rhythmic transcript abundance and transcription profiles of transcribing rnapii to determine the circadian transcriptome of neurospora and assess the contribution of transcription versus post-transcriptional processes to gene expression rhythms controlled by the circadian clock. by frequent sampling we have obtained detailed phase information. moreover, we analyzed the roles of wcc and csp <dig> on circadian gene expression rhythms.

RESULTS
transcription-based rhythmic gene expression in two circadian phases
to identify circadian rhythms in gene expression in a genome-wide manner, neurospora cultures were entrained to 11/11 hour light/dark cycles for two days and then released into constant darkness. samples were harvested in two-hour intervals in constant darkness over a time period of 22 hours, which corresponds to the endogenous free-running period of the circadian clock of neurospora  <cit> . rna levels were quantified by next-generation sequencing  . to identify rhythmically transcribed genes we analyzed the circadian profiles of elongating rnapii by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  with an antibody recognizing serine- <dig> phosphorlyated c-terminal domain repeats of the large subunit of rnapii  from an independent time-course experiment . examples of circadian rna abundance rhythms and the corresponding rnapii-s2p occupancy profiles of previously identified clock-controlled genes are shown in figure 1a and additional file 2: figure s1a. using arser  <cit>  we identified  <dig> genes with cycling rna levels and  <dig>  genes with rhythmic rnapii-s2p occupancy   . both rhythmic transcript levels and transcribing rnapii profiles cluster into two main phases, with peak levels either late night to early morning  or late day to early evening  . a total of  <dig> genes displayed significant rhythms in both transcript levels as well as rnapii-s2p occupancy  . the transcribing rnapii profiles and the corresponding transcript abundance rhythms of these genes were in phase , suggesting that the expression rhythms were generated on the level of transcription. the amplitudes of the rna abundance and transcribing rnapii rhythms were generally rather low . we suspected that the rather low overlap of rna abundance and rnapii-s2p occupancy rhythms  may be due to the failure reliably to detect low amplitude rhythms and genes with low expression levels. in accordance, genes with significant rna abundance and transcription rhythms had a higher coverage and amplitude in both rna-seq and rnapii-s2p chip-seq . based on randomly shuffled data, we estimated that the false discovery rate  increased substantially with decreasing coverage and amplitude . highly expressed genes with high amplitude  should be highly confident clock-controlled genes. in fact, analysis of  <dig> robustly oscillating transcripts  revealed that  <dig>  displayed in-phase rnapii-s <dig> transcription rhythms . for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes, a transcription rhythm was probably not detected due to an outlier and the remaining  <dig> genes had a low rnapii-s2p coverage . together the data suggest that highly rhythmic genes display in-phase transcription and rna abundance rhythms.figure  <dig>

in order to detect the group of potentially rhythmically transcribed genes, we analyzed all candidates with a significant rna abundance rhythm  that had in addition a non-significant rnapii-s2p rhythm  in phase with the transcript rhythm  and vice versa all genes with a significant rnapii-s2p rhythm  and a non-significant rna abundance rhythm in the same phase . an additional  <dig>  genes met these criteria. combined analyses of these  <dig>  genes together with the  <dig> genes with significant rna abundance and rnapii-s2p occupancy rhythms  suggest that, in total, about  <dig>  genes were rhythmically transcribed under the growth conditions used  .figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig> rhythmically transcribed genes  did not show corresponding in phase transcript abundance rhythms  . heat-map analysis suggested that the transcript levels of these genes increase with a substantial delay after the transcription rhythm . hence, these rnas could have a long half-life resulting in a delayed phase and a blunted abundance rhythm  <cit> . moreover, rnapii-s2p amplitude of the oscillations of these genes was lower compared to genes identified by both methods .

finally,  <dig> genes with significant rna abundance rhythms did not exhibit rhythmic rnapii-s2p occupancy profiles  . this class of genes is potentially interesting since the rna abundance rhythms might be based on hitherto unknown post-transcriptional mechanisms that are controlled by the circadian clock. however, the average rnapii-s2p read coverage of these genes was low in comparison to genes that have significant profiles in rnapii-s2p occupancy and rna abundance  . thus, we cannot rigorously exclude transcription based expression rhythms of these genes. together, the data suggest that expression of ccgs in neurospora is predominantly associated with rhythmic transcription. transcription independent generation of circadian transcript abundance rhythms, for example, on the level of rhythmic rna turnover, may thus not be a major pathway used by the circadian clock.

a very recent rna-seq analysis of three replicate time-courses by hurley et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes with circadian rna abundances rhythms. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were expressed under our growth conditions and  <dig> of them were assigned as rhythmic in our study . the remaining  <dig> genes were expressed at low levels under our conditions and oscillated with low amplitude in our and the hurley et al. study . a comparison of rna abundance rhythms and rnapii-s2p profiles of the rhythmic genes identified by both studies suggests that these genes are controlled on the level of transcription .

hurley et al. found among  <dig> luciferase reporters two genes  with rhythmic rna but no luciferase rhythm of the corresponding reporter gene , suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation. we analyzed the rnapii-s2p profiles of these genes by chip-seq and chip-pcr and found that both genes are rhythmically transcribed .

wcc and csp <dig> are major determinants of circadian phase
the morning-specific core circadian transcription factor wcc is rhythmically inactivated by clock-dependent phosphorylation  <cit> . when the function of wcc is compromised light- or clock-dependent transcription is essentially abolished  <cit> . to identify genes that are potentially regulated by wcc we analyzed the transcriptomes of light-grown cultures of wt and ∆wc <dig> strains by rna-seq. the expression of  <dig>  genes was reduced in ∆wc <dig> and  <dig> of these genes were transcribed in rhythmic fashion in wt in constant darkness  . we have previously shown that wcc controls morning specific expression of the transcription repressor csp <dig>  <cit> . csp <dig> is a global glucose-dependent regulator with the potential to repress  <dig>  genes . a total of  <dig> putative target genes of csp <dig> were transcribed in circadian fashion  . the expression rhythms of the majority of the wcc-dependent ccgs were dawn-phased while most csp1-repressed rhythmic genes were dusk-phased in accordance with the morning specific activating and repressing activity, respectively, of these transcription factors .figure  <dig>

we then analyzed the expression phases of ccgs that might be indirectly induced by the csp <dig> repressor  or indirectly repressed by the wcc activator  . these ccgs were also expressed in either a morning- or evening-specific manner. the  <dig> ccgs that were upregulated in ∆wc <dig> were preferentially dusk-phased   while the  <dig> ccgs upregulated in a csp <dig> overexpressing strain  were mainly dawn-phased  . together, wcc and csp <dig> appear to regulate, directly or indirectly, at least  <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes  that were rhythmically transcribed in wt. indeed, we found that  <dig> of  <dig>  rhythmically expressed genes have csp <dig> binding sites in their upstream regions suggesting a direct regulation by csp <dig> . hence, wcc and csp <dig> are major determinants of clock-controlled transcription and circadian phase.

in order to further investigate the role of csp <dig> in circadian gene regulation, we analyzed the expression of several csp1-repressed genes in wt and ∆csp <dig> by rt-qpcr . in the absence of csp <dig> the levels of glycerol dehydrogenase  <dig>  rna were elevated and the expression phase was shifted from evening to the early day . this major phase change emphasizes the dominant role of csp <dig> on the evening specific expression of gld <dig>  the expression levels of erg- <dig>  and to a lesser extent of prm- <dig>  were also elevated in ∆csp <dig> and the expression phases were shifted towards morning . interestingly, the csp <dig> target genes analyzed above were rhythmically expressed in ∆csp <dig>  suggesting that rhythmic transcription activators control their expression in addition to the rhythmic csp <dig> repressor. the phase shifts towards subjective morning in ∆csp <dig> suggests rather that these evening-specific genes are controlled by morning-specific circadian transcription activators.figure  <dig>

we have previously shown that csp <dig> inhibits wc <dig> transcription and thereby regulates wcc expression levels  <cit> . therefore, we also analyzed the expression of frq, which is a direct target of wcc. in ∆csp <dig> the levels of frq rna were slightly elevated and the expression phase was slightly advanced , consistent with the shorter period rhythm observed in ∆csp <dig> in high glucose conditions  <cit> .

in order to assess the contribution of csp <dig> on the generation of rhythmic transcripts, we determined the circadian transcriptome of ∆csp <dig> by rna-seq . at first, we analyzed the phases of the  <dig>  genes that were rhythmically transcribed in wt. a total of  <dig>  of these genes were expressed in ∆csp <dig>  of these  <dig>  expressed genes,  <dig>  showed similar circadian expression patterns in wt and ∆csp <dig>  whereas  <dig> ccgs  were expressed in different phases in ∆csp <dig>  a total of  <dig> ccgs with dawn-specific expression in wt shifted to predominantly dusk-phased expression in ∆csp <dig>  and  <dig> ccgs that showed dusk-phased rhythms in wt shifted to predominantly late-night-specific expression in ∆csp <dig> . the data suggest that csp <dig> affects the expression phase of morning- and evening-specific ccgs.figure  <dig>

interestingly, we identified  <dig>  genes that were rhythmically expressed in ∆csp <dig>  but not in wt . the expression rhythms of these ∆csp1-specific ccgs also were clustered in two phases. about 2/ <dig> of the ∆csp1-specific ccgs were expressed with a dusk- and 1/ <dig> with a dawn-specific phase. intriguingly, the dusk- and dawn-phased ∆csp1-specific ccgs also clustered in two groups in wt, displaying rather complex temporal expression profiles . the data suggest that expression of these genes is clock-controlled. however, under the conditions analyzed, that is, 2% glucose-containing medium, their circadian regulation in wt appears to be blunted by the glucose-dependent activity of csp <dig>  examples of these ∆csp1-specific genes are shown in additional file 14: figure s4c.

together, the data suggest that csp <dig> regulates the phase and amplitude of both dusk-phased and dawn-phased rhythmic genes. the over-expression of csp <dig> indicates that dusk-phased genes are repressed by csp <dig> in the subjective morning whereas dawn-phased genes are indirectly activated via unknown pathways. rhythmic expression of only a fraction of dusk-phased genes is affected in a ∆csp <dig> strain, suggesting that other transcription factors  contribute to evening-specific gene expression. the increased accumulation of wcc in ∆csp <dig>  <cit>  could additionally affect expression of dawn- and dusk-phased ccgs, suggesting a further mechanism by which csp <dig> may affect circadian gene expression.

temporal separation of biological functions by the circadian clock
an analysis of the functional categories of genes controlled by the circadian clock of neurospora revealed an astonishingly clear functional separation between dawn- and dusk-phased genes. genes with functions related to metabolism and cell rescue/defense were enriched in the group of dawn-phased ccgs, whereas gene categories related to growth, such as cell cycle, protein synthesis and biogenesis of cellular components, were enriched among the dusk-phased genes  . examples of the dawn-phased metabolic genes involved in the utilization of carbon sources are shown in figure 6b. the genes gcy- <dig>  l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase and l-xylulose reductase, which are required for the utilization of l-arabinose, and gcy, a putative d-xylose reductase gene , were expressed with a dawn-phased rhythm. l-arabinose and d-xylose are the major pentoses of plant hemicellulose and pectin  <cit> , that is, of natural substrates of neurospora. l-arabinose and d-xylose are converted to xylitol, which is further processed via the pentose phosphate pathway and, eventually, funneled into glycolysis. interestingly, eno- <dig>  encoding for the glycolytic enolase, also displayed a robust dawn-phased expression rhythm.figure  <dig> 
distinct functional bias of dawn- and dusk-phased genes.  the enrichment of the functional categories of dawn- and dusk-phased genes is shown. in total,  <dig>  genes with in-phase rna and rnapii-s2p profiles together with  <dig> genes with rhythmic rna levels but not rhythmic rnapii-s2p occupancy were analyzed with mips funcat  <cit>  using ‘neurospora crassa’ database. the dotted red line shows the border for significance p < <dig> . rna expression profiles of selected genes involved in  metabolism,  cell rescue and defense,  transcription, and  cell cycle are shown. rna-seq reads were double plotted. light- and dark-shaded areas correspond to subjective day  and night , respectively. the expression levels  are shown as mapped normalized reads. funcat, functional catalogue; mips, munich information center for protein sequences. rnapii, rna polymerase ii.



examples of dawn-phased genes involved in cell rescue and defense are shown in figure 6c. the dawn-phased expression of heat-shock factors may contribute to the adaptation of neurospora to higher temperature expected during the day. in order to prevent desiccation during the day fungi  synthesize trehalose. neurospora can synthesize trehalose via a one-step pathway by the trehalose synthase encoded by the morning-specific clock-controlled gene- <dig>   <cit>  and via a two-step reaction requiring α, α-trehalose phosphate synthase and trehalose phosphatase . the corresponding genes are rhythmically expressed with a morning-specific phase . it is also noteworthy that the neurospora lysozyme gene  was rhythmically expressed with peak levels at dawn . although the function of lysozymes in fungi is not well characterized, a potential anti-microbial activity might preferentially be required during the day, when bacterial growth is supported by elevated temperature.

a recent study revealed a role of the circadian clock in the coordination of ribosome biogenesis in mammals  <cit> . in neurospora, the genes rpc- <dig>  rpb- <dig> and rpa- <dig>  which encode subunits of rna polymerase i, were rhythmically expressed with a dusk-phased peak . moreover, rpf- <dig> and dbp- <dig>  genes involved in rrna maturation and ribosome assembly, were rhythmically expressed in an evening-specific manner. the data suggest that the circadian clock of neurospora might affect ribosome biogenesis and protein translation.

genes involved in dna replication and cell division were also enriched among the dusk-phased circadian genes . for example, mcm- <dig>  mcm <dig> and mcm- <dig> encoding subunits of dna replication licensing factor, required to initiate dna replication in eukaryotes  <cit> , were rhythmically expressed with a peak around dusk. the other subunits, mcm- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  did not qualify as rhythmic genes by our criteria but appeared to be expressed with low-amplitude dusk-phased rhythms . in addition rpa- <dig> and rpa- <dig>  encoding the subunits of hetero-trimeric replication protein a, also showed circadian expression with a similar peak time with mcm genes. . furthermore, rfc- <dig>  which encodes a subunit of the hetero-pentameric clamp loader complex, was expressed with a dusk-phased rhythm. the genes encoding the remaining subunits of the clamp loader were potentially also expressed in an evening specific manner . moreover, the genes encoding the core histones hh2a, hh2b, hh <dig> and hh <dig> were expressed at higher levels during dusk . finally, the gene encoding for the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase was robustly rhythmic with an evening specific phase . the data strongly suggest that genes required for various aspects of cell division and growth are expressed in an evening-specific manner under the control of the circadian clock of neurospora.

together, the bi-phasic clustering of ccgs and the pronounced separation of the corresponding gene functions suggest a global and comprehensive temporal coordination of gene expression by the circadian clock to support rhythmic growth of neurospora.

in nature neurospora is often detected on scorched or decaying plant material. recently,  <dig> genes were found to be upregulated when neurospora was grown in liquid medium with ground plant tissue  or crystalline cellulose  as carbon sources  <cit> . under the conditions used in our study, that is, glucose containing medium,  <dig> of these genes were under circadian control with predominantly dawn-phased rhythms , including genes required for the mobilization and utilization of cellulose. in order to assess the physiological relevance of circadian expression of these genes, neurospora was grown on avicel-containing medium and cellulase activity associated with mycelial pads was measured in a time-of-day dependent manner in wt and ∆csp <dig>  cellulase activity associated with wt mycelia was higher at late night to early morning  coinciding with the expression rhythm of cellulose utilization enzymes. in ∆csp <dig> the dawn-phased cellulase activity was reduced, resulting in a blunted activity rhythm .figure  <dig>

our data suggest that clusters of functionally related genes are expressed in a morning- or evening-specific manner under the control of the neurospora clock.

discussion
in this study we analyzed circadian gene expression in neurospora on a genome-wide level to reveal organizational principles of clock-regulation. temporal profiles of the circadian transcriptome and elongating rnapii revealed  <dig> and  <dig>  genes with significant rhythms, respectively. the two hour experimental sampling frequency  provided rather reliable amplitude and phase information even from a single replicate. a ‘false discovery’ estimation based on randomly shuffled data indicated that the confidence for detecting clock-controlled genes increases with sequence coverage and amplitude of the rnapii-s2p chip-seq and rna-seq. based on the false discovery estimation many sequencing replicates would be required to reliably identify all lowly expressed clock-controlled genes. however, assuming that such genes are rhythmically regulated in similar fashion as highly expressed genes, a complete list of such genes per se may not be of interest.

we show that the rna abundance and transcription rhythms clustered mainly in two phases with peak levels around dawn and dusk. at least  <dig>  genes appear to be transcribed in circadian fashion by our criteria . another  <dig> genes are rhythmically transcribed but may encode rather stable transcripts that accumulate with a delayed phase and blunted amplitude. the abundance levels of  <dig> transcripts cycled in circadian fashion without an apparent rhythm of transcribing rnapii. rhythmic expression of these genes could potentially be regulated by post-transcriptional clock-controlled mechanisms. however, these genes showed very low rnapii occupancy and low rna expression levels so that the absence of an apparent transcription rhythm might, in many cases, be due to detection problems. hence, the vast majority of rhythmically expressed genes of neurospora appear to be controlled on the level of rhythmic transcription. clock-dependent posttranscriptional mechanisms could in principle synergistically contribute to cycling rna abundance levels to support rhythmic transcription. however, circadian expression of only a very small fraction of rhythmic genes might be exclusively controlled on a post-transcriptional level.

a recent analysis of clock-regulated genes in neurospora suggested post-transcriptional regulation of circadian mrna abundance rhythms based on the absence of a strong correlation between endogenous transcript abundance rhythms  and the presumed transcriptional activity of  <dig> luciferase reporter genes  <cit> . however, the luciferase reporters contained complete gene-specific 5’ utrs and 3’ utrs , which usually contain regulatory elements for posttranscriptional control  <cit>  and were thus not suited to report promoter activity. the observed differences between mrna and luc expression were likely due to growth conditions suppressing and supporting rhythmic conidiation, respectively.

in contrast to neurospora, genome-wide analyses of circadian gene expression rhythms in mice and flies suggested a substantial contribution of posttranscriptional mechanisms  <cit> . although the distribution of expression phases of ccgs was more diverse in mice and flies  <cit>  than in neurospora, a recent analysis suggested dawn and dusk as rush hours for circadian gene expression in various mouse tissues and organs  <cit> .

expression of at least 80% of the genes that were rhythmically expressed in wt was directly or indirectly affected by the transcription activator wcc or the transcription repressor csp <dig>  rhythmically expressed genes whose expression was reduced in the absence of wcc  were predominantly morning specific. in contrast, rhythmically expressed genes downregulated by the morning-specific global repressor csp <dig>  were predominantly dusk-phased. hence, wcc and csp <dig> are major determinants of the expression phase of ccgs .figure  <dig> 
model of dawn- and dusk-phased transcription regulation. genes activated by the wcc are transcribed predominantly during subjective late night to early morning where the activity of wcc is high. the activity of other transcription factors  including csp <dig> could modulate the exact phase and the amplitude of these dawn-phased genes. these dawn-specific genes are mainly involved in energy harvesting and cell rescue. the phases of csp <dig> repressed genes are enriched around dusk. yet unidentified tfs must be involved in rhythmic activation of these genes since the phase and amplitude, but not the rhythmic expression of tested genes, were affected in ∆csp <dig>  our data suggest that expression of these tfs could be under the control of wcc. dusk-phased genes are involved in energy utilization and growth, indicating a temporal distinction of cellular pathways and functions coordinated by the circadian clock of neurospora.




surprisingly, the number of rhythmically expressed genes increased more than twofold in the absence of csp <dig>  this increase may reflect the interconnection between circadian gene expression and metabolism, since csp <dig> expression is dependent on the glucose concentration in the medium  <cit> . the circadian transcriptomes of wt and Δcsp <dig> were determined from cultures grown in high glucose medium, that is, under conditions when csp <dig> is active. under these conditions Δcsp1-specific ccgs might be repressed in wt and/or their rhythm might be blunted beyond the limit of detection. the rhythmic rna abundances of the previously identified csp <dig> target genes remained rhythmic in Δcsp <dig> but showed phase shifts towards morning indicating that unknown tfs rhythmically activate their transcription.

the data strongly suggest that the complexity of the apparent circadian transcriptome is dependent on growth conditions. recently, a similar phenomenon has been observed in mammals: feeding mice with a high-fat diet  resulted in phase advances or even loss of transcript rhythms, in addition to the appearance of new oscillating transcripts  <cit> . the appearance of new rhythmic transcripts was dependent on increased pparγ activity. integration of nutrient sensing tfs, such as csp <dig> in neurospora and pparγ in mammals, into the core circadian gene network could modulate circadian output according to the needs of the cell under various nutrient conditions. the rich medium and constant conditions generally used to analyze circadian rhythms in neurospora or mammalian cell culture may specifically disfavor and even suppress circadian gene expression rhythms, resulting in detection of a rather low number of ccgs.

an overruling distinction of dusk- and dawn-phased genes became evident when we analyzed the functional gene categories enriched in these two groups. dawn-phased gene expression supports catabolic reactions whereas expression of dusk-phased genes supports anabolic reactions. this temporal separation of physiology could confer efficient utilization of available energy sources. thus, during the day, when forward growth of neurospora is fast but little biomass is produced, it may occupy and assess its environment and mobilize available resources . during the day neurospora seems to specifically protect itself from desiccation , high temperature  and bacterial competitors . towards the end of the day and during the night, when the environment becomes less hostile, genes required for protein synthesis , dna replication and cell division  <cit>   are upregulated to initiate cell growth and production of biomass in accordance with the previous assessment of available resources.

CONCLUSIONS
number, identity, phase and amplitude of rhythmically expressed genes, that is, the complexity of the circadian transcriptome, are likely a property of a complex metabolic network and depend on environmental conditions. the intimate link of circadian clocks with metabolism seems to be conserved in cyanobacteria, plants and animals  <cit> . coordination of catabolic and anabolic function might thus be the major role of circadian clocks.

materials and methods
neurospora strains and culture conditions
neurospora strains wt , ∆csp <dig>  and ∆wc <dig>  were acquired from fungal genetics stock center . vogel's medium  supplemented with 2% glucose,  <dig> % l-arginine and 10 ng/ml biotin was used as a standard growth medium. for the circadian time course experiments, 200 ml medium in 500 ml flasks were inoculated with approximately  <dig> conidia and grown in light for six hours for conidial germination. afterwards cultures were entrained in 11 hour/11 hour light/dark cycles for 2 days and released to constant dark for 22 hours. cultures were transferred in a staggered manner, so harvesting of the cultures was performed within 10 hours.

cellulase assay
cultures were grown in vogel’s medium with 2% avicel as the carbon source for the cellulase assay. during harvesting, cultures were washed with three culture volumes of cold water to minimize extracellular cellulase contamination. due to the adherence of neurospora to avicel we can measure extracellular cellulase that is trapped in the avicel/neurospora mesh in addition to intracellular cellulase in the secretory pathway. extraction buffer , 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin a) was mixed with 500 μl ground mycelia and incubated on ice for approximately 30 minutes with frequent vortexing. the cell homogenate was centrifuged at  <dig>  g at 4°c for 30 minutes. protein concentration was determined by nanodrop  <dig> spectrometer. cellulase activity was calculated by using azo-cm-cellulose  according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. briefly, 120 μg total protein extract diluted in 200 μl 100 mm naoac, ph  <dig>  was mixed with 200 μl azo-cm-cellulose and incubated at 40°c for one hour with constant shaking. a 1 ml precipitation solution  was added to the protein-azo-cm-cellulose mixture and centrifuged at  <dig>  g at room temperature for 10 minutes. the color of the supernatant was measured at 590 nm with a jenway 6320d spectrophotometer. to generate the standard curve for cellulase activity , cellulase from aspergillus niger   was used.

rna analysis
rna was extracted with peqgold trifast  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. rna was dissolved in 70 μl nuclease free water with 80u ribolock rnase inhibitor . for the cdna preparation maxima first strand cdna synthesis kit  was used. transcript levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr in 96-well plates with the steponeplus real-time pcr system  using taqman gene expression master mix . primers and probes are listed in additional file 18: table s <dig>  rrna was used for normalization.

chip was performed as described previously  <cit>  by using specific antibody for serine- <dig> phosphorylated rnapii c-terminal tail. polyclonal anti-rabbit rnapii ser2-p was raised against the peptide ptspsyptspsc. primers and probes used for chip-pcrs are listed in additional file 18: table s <dig>  actin gene  was used for normalization.

rna sequencing and chip sequencing
cdna was prepared by using nebnext® ultra rna prep kit with nebnext® multiplex oligos according to the manufacturer’s instructions. chip dna libraries were prepared with nebnext® chip-seq library prep reagent set for illumina® with nebnext® multiplex oligos. a  <dig> bioanalyzer was used to check the size and the quality of the libraries. un-paired sequencing with 50 bp reads was performed with a hiseq  <dig> at genecore embl heidelberg for rna-seq and by the bgi, hong kong, for chip-seq. individual sequence reads for each run are available in the sequence read archive  database under the study name prjna <dig>  accession numbers for experiments and number of sequence reads are listed in additional file 19: table s <dig> 

high-throughput data analysis
raw sequence reads were mapped to the neurospora crassa genome  using bowtie  <cit> , where parameters were set to allow maximum three mismatches and suppress alignments which mapped to more than one location. gene expression was quantified by the number of reads falling into the annotated exons. for analysis of the rnapii-s2p chip-seq the reads that fall to the 500 bp window upstream of gene end position were counted. normalization was carried out using the size factor formula as described  <cit> .

in order to prevent a read contamination from neighboring genes, an ‘influence factor’ was calculated as shown below: influence=g/lgg−o/lg−lo where g is the read count mapped to the gene, lg is the length of the gene, o is the read count mapped to the overlapping region and lo is the length of the overlap. the gene with an influence factor larger than  <dig> was filtered from the rna-seq and chip-seq analysis. the genes with low rna levels  were excluded from further analysis. in order to assign the cut-off for rnapii-s2p chip-seq, a background read was calculated by counting the reads that fall into 500 bp windows from non-coding regions of the genome. genes with a lower rnapii-s2p signal compared to the median of the background reads were excluded from further analysis. normalized rna-seq and rnapii-s2p reads are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 13: table s <dig> .

differential gene expression analysis
the read counts mapped to the genes were assumed to follow a negative binomial  distribution: gi≈nbμi,σi where μi is the mean and σi is the variance. σi was estimated based on the mean and variance correlation. a ‘locfit’ r package was used to fit the relationship between mean and variance. adapting from the robinson and smyth exact test  <cit> , the two-sided p value can be calculated by using the formula: p=Σfa,b≤fgtreat,gcontrolfa,bΣfa,b where a+b=gitreat+gitreat,a,b∈0…gitreat+gitreat,gitreat is the reads count of ith gene in treatment condition, gitreat is the reads count of ith gene in control condition, f  is the product of f  and f , which can be computed using ‘dnbinom’ of the r package.

identification of rhythmic rna and rnapii-s2p profiles
the arser  <cit>  program was used to identify rhythmic rna and rnapii-s2p profiles. period length was set between  <dig> to 26 hours. in order to detect rhythmic expression of genes that have very high expression levels in light , we ran arser twice with and without the  <dig> time point. all genes that have arser detected rna and/or rnapii-s2p profiles were selected for further analysis. the arser output is shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  independent phase and amplitude determination was performed by fitting the data to a sine wave using a negative binomial generalized linear model. the ‘glm.nb/function from mass package of r was used and the period length was set as 22 hours.

false discovery rate analysis
in total,  <dig> simulation data were generated for rna and rnapii-s2p by randomly shuffling the  <dig> time points by using the ‘sample’ function of r. the shuffled data were then analyzed by arser twice with and without  <dig> time point. it was observed that the occurrence of rhythmic genes follows an exponential decay function against the amplitude; exponential decay functions were fitted to both the original and the simulated data. the fdr was then computed by using the following formula: fdramplitude=fbgamplitudefobamplitude+fbgamplitude×weightamplitude 

where, fbg, fob are the estimated occurrence of rhythmic genes against the amplitude using the fitted exponential decay function, and weight  is introduced to remove the bias for the smaller number of occurrence when the amplitude is high. fdr according to coverage is computed by using the same formula.
