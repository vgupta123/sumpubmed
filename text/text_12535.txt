BACKGROUND
grapevine is an economically important crop, producing fruits that are consumed as fresh berries, pressed juice, dried berries and processed to make wine. berry quality is determined by parameters measured at harvest, such as sugar content, acidity, skin color, berry size and polyphenol content. these depend on metabolic processes activated in the berry pericarp  at the onset of ripening, reflecting a deep re-programming of the transcriptome  <cit> . moreover, skin and pulp develop specialized features during ripening. in particular, skin accumulates anthocyanin to attract animals for seed-dispersal, provides a physical barrier against pathogens, avoid berry withering by preventing water loss and protects from solar radiation. this functional specialization is regulated at the transcriptional level  <cit> . berry ripening inception is triggered by internal and external stimuli, via complex signal transduction pathways. internal factors are hormones, such as auxins  <cit> , abscisic acid  <cit> , brassinosteroids  <cit>  and ethylene  <cit> ; metabolic factors, such sugar accumulation  <cit>  and the increase of turgor pressure  <cit>  and small signaling mediators, such as ca2+ <cit> . an oxidative burst coinciding with berry color change and the modulation of reactive oxygen species  scavengers at the gene and protein level have been reported in grapevine, raising the possibility of ros taking part to the signaling mechanisms occurring at fruit ripening  <cit> .

intracellular ros can be generated by the incomplete reduction of oxygen or by energy transfer to an oxygen molecule. the first group of ros are usually by-products of oxidative metabolisms such as respiration, photosynthesis and fatty acid oxidation, respectively occurring in mitochondria, chloroplasts and peroxisomes, and rapidly interconvert into the more stable hydrogen peroxide . the latter is represented by singlet oxygen  and is produced by energy transfer at the phtosystem ii reaction center, inside the chloroplasts  <cit> . nonetheless, h2o <dig> can also be generated enzymatically by a family of nadph-oxidases  <cit> . despite their toxicity, at low levels ros act as signaling molecules  <cit> . the specificity and selectivity of ros signaling depend on the origin, reactivity and spatio-temporal accumulation of each ros, as highlighted by a meta-analysis of ros-related microarray experiments  <cit> . h2o <dig> is a signaling factor in plant response to external biotic and abiotic stimuli as well as in developmentally regulated processes . h2o <dig> accumulation has been detected in numerous transitional phases of development: in grapevine at the moment of bud break  <cit> , in sunflower during seed dormancy release  <cit> , in tomato and grapevine at fruit ripening  <cit>  and in arabidopsis at floral transition  <cit> . 1o <dig> is the principal ros that accumulates in illuminated photosynthetic tissues  <cit>  and can trigger either acclimation or programmed cell death depending on the intracellular abundance  <cit> . a mechanism for plastid-to-nucleus 1o <dig> signaling is based on the generation of small volatiles derived from carotene oxidation which regulate transcription  <cit> .

among the most abundant molecules prone to ros-induced damage, there are poly-unsaturated fatty acids , such as linolenic  and linoleic  acid. they can be oxidized by different molecules through different mechanisms generating specific regio- and stereo-isomers and this feature allows to identify a posteriori the ros which accumulated. indeed, lipid peroxidation can be generated either by nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals, 1o <dig> direct addition or lipoxygenase and α-dioxygenase-catalyzed o <dig> addition  <cit> . peroxidized fatty acid chains are rapidly converted into lower-molecular-weight compounds known as oxylipins  <cit> , which can act as signaling molecules or be precursors of aromatic volatiles  <cit> . jasmonic acid is an oxylipin derived via the lipoxygenase-mediated peroxidation of linolenic acid in the plastids, but also other oxylipins are known to play signaling roles in development  <cit>  and defense  <cit> .

plant lipoxygenases  are 95– <dig> kda monomeric proteins with an n-terminal β-barrel domain , known as plat, probably involved in membrane or protein interactions, and a c-terminal α-helix-rich domain  containing the catalytic site, including a non-heme iron coordinated by five amino acid side chains and a water or hydroxide ligand  <cit> . they are classified according to the positional specificity of linoleic acid oxygenation, i.e. at carbon atom  <dig>  or  <dig> , leading to the formation of 9-hydroperoxy and 13-hydroperoxy derivatives . all plastidial loxs are 13-loxs and usually have a neutral ph optimum, whereas extra-plastidial loxs can be either 9-loxs or 13-loxs and usually have an alkaline ph optimum  <cit> .

we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the oxidative burst occurring in pinot noir grape berry skin at the onset of ripening to determine the potential signaling roles of ros in fruit development. we also identified a plastidial lox, likely responsible for galactolipid peroxidation and oxylipin synthesis, which might represent a novel component of this regulatory network.

RESULTS
singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide accumulate in pinot noir berry skin at the beginning of ripening
the ripening of grapevine cv. pinot noir berries was followed during seven weeks starting from pre-véraison stage until mid-ripening . berries at pre-véraison ) were green and hard and were characterized by high content of organic acids and low content of sugars whereas berries sampled after  <dig> wpf were colored, soft, rich in sugars and with a low acidic content. the period between  <dig> and  <dig> wpf, named véraison, represents the transition to ripening during which crucial events occur: dramatic opposing changes of organic acids and sugars contents in the pulp, softening of the fruit and coloring of the skin. these changes do not take place in a synchronous way among berries of the same cluster, as shown in the picture of figure 1a. as clusters were sampled by date and berries randomly pooled for must and pigment analyses, the obtained profiles, reported in figure 1a, were smooth and diluted in time. conversely, when sampling is based on physico-chemical characteristics of the berries, as for instance in  <cit> , the differences between developmental stages are more sharp and larger.

h2o <dig> levels were measured separately in the skin and pulp of pinot noir berry samples . while in the pulp a gradual decrease of h2o <dig> was observed, in the skin there was a clear accumulation of h2o <dig> at the beginning of ripening, with a maximum in samples collected at  <dig> wpf. this result leads to the conclusion that the transient peak in h2o <dig> content previously observed in whole berries at véraison  <cit>  was actually contributed predominantly by the skin. a similar profile was observed in pinot noir during season  <dig> . taken in consideration the fact that samples collected by date are quite heterogeneous and that h2o <dig> accumulation is usually a fast event, its increase between  <dig> and  <dig> wpf likely corresponds to the proportion of berries undergoing the transition to ripening rather than to h2o <dig> increase within a single berry. as our interest is focused on cell signals, we did not further investigate the decreasing profile of h2o <dig> in the pulp, instead we characterized the events occurring in the skin.

imaging of 1o <dig> and h2o <dig> at the onset of ripening
single berries at the three developmental stages around the onset of ripening  were collected at  <dig> wpf in  <dig> and sliced with a microtome to be used for ros detection. ros imaging was carried out by staining with three fluorescent dyes each specific for three type of ros: dichlorofluorescein diacetate , which is sensitive to most ros, hydroxyphenyl fluorescein , which is specific for strong oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite anion, and singlet oxygen sensor green , which is specific for 1o <dig>  confocal images of sections stained with dcfda and sosg revealed the presence of ros at the green soft and pale red stages and in the outer cell layers, i.e. those composing the skin . hpf did not yield a signal , suggesting that the ros detected with dcfda were weak oxidants, such as h2o <dig>  the merge of the pictures obtained recording dcfda/sosg and chlorophylls fluorescence signals superimposed to the bright field showed that the localization of h2o <dig> and 1o <dig> was different at the subcellular level: h2o <dig> was detected in the cytosol whereas 1o <dig> exclusively in the plastids .

catalase activity is strongly enhanced in the berry skin during ripening
catalase activity was investigated due to its relevance to h2o <dig> scavenging. it was initially visualized in total protein berry skin extracts by zymography as a strong single band in the samples collected at 10– <dig> wpf, indicating the activation of one specific isoform . catalase activity was then quantified in vitro by spectrophotometry  and by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry , to unequivocally distinguish catalase from other scavenger activities . both assays confirmed the strong increase at  <dig> wpf, suggesting that catalase contributes to h2o <dig> scavenging after véraison. according to our results, the low level of h2o <dig> at pre-véraison cannot be attributed to a catalase scavenging activity and the following increase at véraison must thus be linked to an augmented ros production, as commented in the discussion.

galactolipid peroxidation occurs at the onset of ripening
membrane lipids were analyzed with the aim to detect characteristic modifications caused by ros accumulation. crude lipid extracts were analyzed without pre-processing  in order to study cell membrane lipid composition. initially, the presence of peroxidized galactolipids at véraison was detected by maldi-tof mass spectrometry on extracts of berries collected during  <dig> . then, lipid extracts prepared from berries collected during  <dig> season were analyzed by chromatographic separation coupled to mass spectrometry identification, as outlined in figure  <dig>  three peaks absorbing at  <dig> nm were identified as oxidized lipids, as this wavelength is specific of the conjugated diene bonds formed during pufas oxidation. they were identified as the oxidized forms of monogalactosyl diacylglycerol and digalactosyl diacylglycerol carrying two α-linolenic fatty acid chains . mgdg 36: <dig> and dgdg 36: <dig> were indeed the most abundant galactolipid species. their structures were determined by full-scan electrospray ionization  in positive-ion mode  where they appeared as + and + ion adducts and showed the same ion fragment at m/z  <dig> reflecting the loss of the corresponding sugar moiety. esi-ms/ms on the + ion adducts revealed strong fragment signals at m/z  <dig>  and  <dig> , reflecting the loss of linolenic acid at the primary position on the glycerol backbone, thus suggesting the presence of two identical 18: <dig> acyl chains in both the membrane lipids  <cit> . the analysis of purified samples containing mgdg and dgdg by 1h-nmr spectroscopy confirmed the presence of characteristic signals representing monogalactose  and digalactose  and also confirmed the presence of the 9z,12z,15z octadecatrienoic  acyl group for both the unsaturated chains.

comprehensive hplc-ms analysis of the peaks with lower retention times indicated the presence of more polar lipids in the extracts, strongly absorbing at  <dig> nm. these species gave esi mass spectra with ion adducts and fragment ions  <dig> da heavier than the corresponding native galactolipids, indicating the presence of an additional hydroxyl group on one of the acyl chains . in the esi mass spectrum of peak  <dig> , the ions at m/z  <dig> and  <dig> therefore represent the mono-oxidized forms of mgdg 18:3/18: <dig> , whereas in the esi mass spectrum of peak  <dig> , the ions at m/z  <dig> and  <dig> represent the mono-oxidized forms of dgdg 18:3/18: <dig> . at lower retention times, we also detected di-oxidized forms of mgdg 18:3/18: <dig>  and dgdg 18:3/18: <dig> . esi-ms/ms of the mono-oxidized mgdg 18:3/18: <dig>  revealed two fragment ions at m/z  <dig> and  <dig> due to the loss of α-linolenic acid and oxidized α-linolenic acid, respectively. because this neutral loss should occur more frequently at the primary glycerol position  <cit> , the finding of equally populated fragment ions strongly indicates that the two acyl chains have a similar oxidation propensity. esi-ms/ms of the di-oxidized mgdg 18:3/18: <dig>  revealed only one fragmentation at m/z  <dig> reflecting the loss of mono-oxidized α-linolenic acid, thus ruling out the presence of di-oxidized acyl chains.

the regio and stereo-specificity of the hydroxyl group on the α-linolenic chain, obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of the oxidized mgdg 36: <dig>  was then studied . because fragmentation, besides common loss of neutral molecules , mainly occurs at the two c-c bonds adjacent to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group, the intense daughter ions at m/z  <dig> and  <dig> obtained by collision-induced dissociation of the parent ion at m/z  <dig>  unambiguously established the regiochemical position of the –oh function at the position  <dig> of the linolenic acyl chain  <cit> . finally, we used circular dichroism  spectroscopy to determine the absolute configuration of the c-oxidized galactolipids. we found that the cd spectrum of the compound obtained after alkaline hydrolysis of the oxidized mgdg 36: <dig> from berry skins was identical to the cd spectrum of commercially available -13--hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid , thus indicating a 13-s absolute stereochemistry .

quantification of the oxidized mgdg and dgdg species in pinot noir berry skin along development showed a transient peak of accumulation at  <dig> wpf, mirroring the accumulation of h2o <dig> . by statistically comparing the relative amount of oxidized lipids present in the samples representing pre-véraison , véraison  and ripening  stages, it was evident that galactolipids oxidation state at véraison was significantly different from the other two stages considered. as the mgdg:dgdg ratio ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , the fact that mgdg reached a higher level of peroxidation  suggests that mgdg is oxidized preferentially. moreover, even if di-oxidized mgdg showed the highest increase in terms of fold change, they accumulated to a lower extent than the mono-oxidized ones, suggesting they are less stable.

a plastidial 13-lipoxygenase catalyzes galactolipid peroxidation at the onset of ripening
western blot analysis of total protein extracts obtained from berry skin samples collected during  <dig> was performed using a commercial antibody raised against the arabidopsis plastidial lox <dig> to characterize the presence of lox activity in concurrence with galactolipid peroxidation. a single 95– <dig> kda band was observed in the samples harvested from  <dig>  to  <dig> wpf . we wanted to identify the proteins contained in that band by ms analysis, but their amount was below the instrument sensitivity. in the attempt to enrich the sample in chloroplastic loxs, plastids were isolated from fresh berry skin collected in  <dig> at the green soft/pink stage  using a percoll gradient.chloroplasts were lysed and their content partitioned into stromal and thylakoid-enriched fractions. all the obtained fractions were analyzed for lox expression by western blot . pinot noir lox was found predominantly in the thylakoid-enriched fraction, which was then used for tryptic digestion and ms analyses . nanolc/ms sequencing identified one peptide unambiguously matching vv06s0004g <dig>  a 13-lox differing at only five out of  <dig> residues from the recently described sauvignon blanc loxa  <cit> . this result was confirmed by comparative maldi-tof/ms analysis performed on this fraction and on recombinant vv06s0004g <dig> protein. we therefore named the protein pnloxa.

pnloxa gene expression was analyzed by rt-pcr in a panel of pinot noir tissues and in developing berry skin . we observed a 20-fold increase in its expression at the onset of ripening  matching precisely with the peaks of protein abundance detected by western analysis  and of galactolipid peroxidation . statistical comparison among the three berry development stages defined above highlighted that pnloxa expression at véraison was significantly different from pre-véraison and ripening stages. pnloxa expression was not restricted to the berry. indeed, the gene was expressed in all the photosynthetic tissues we analyzed, particularly in plant structures undergoing developmental changes . these results agree with in silico analysis of lox gene expression in the grapevine atlas : the only tissues where pnloxa is not expressed are woody stem, root and senescent leaf while in winter bud it is minimally expressed. conversely, it is highly expressed in inflorescence, flower, bud, tendril and berry at véraison. the atlas data show that five lox genes are modulated during berry development: two 9-lox  and three 13-lox genes . however, only pnloxa shows an induction at véraison . primary structure analysis of pnloxa indicated the presence of a plastid targeting peptide , a plat domain which might be involved in protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions , and a c-terminal catalytic domain that coordinates fe3+ . we created two fusion constructs with yellow fluorescent protein : one containing only the transit peptide to study pnloxa intracellular localization and the other containing also the plat domain to gain insights into its function. transient expression of the first construct in grapevine and tobacco leaves followed by confocal imaging showed that yfp was efficiently translocated into the chloroplasts . the presence of the plat domain is responsible of a non-uniform distribution of yfp fluorescence inside the plastid, consistent with that of a thylakoid-associated protein . similar results, showing a spot-like localization inside the chloroplast, were reported for potato and tomato lox  <cit> . the in vivo localization supports the previous chloroplast fractionation experiment  and suggests that the plat domain is involved in protein localization at the thylakoid.

finally, we analyzed pnloxa enzymatic activity to confirm its ability to peroxidize free fatty acid chains and also membrane galactolipids. the mature protein was firstly expressed in e. coli, purified by ion-chelating affinity chromatography and tested in vitro. pnloxa catalyzed the regiospecific peroxidation of α-linolenic acid to produce exclusively 13-hotre . to test the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the peroxidation of galactolipids, we incubated pnloxa with the most pure galactolipid fraction isolated from grape berry skins, which was that enriched in dgdg. pnloxa efficiently catalyzed the 13-peroxidation of dgdg 36: <dig>  producing both mono-oxidized  and di-oxidized products . table  <dig> shows the degree of peroxidation within each dgdg species: the prevalence of di-oxidized forms indicates that pnloxa acts on both galactolipid chains without significant discrimination. we also studied membrane lipid peroxidation in vivo by transiently overexpressing pnloxa in tobacco leaf cells. we agro-infiltrated leaves with either the pnloxa construct or the empty vector and collected leaf transformed spots during the following days for protein expression analysis. overexpression of pnloxa, monitored by western blot, reached a maximum at  <dig> days after transformation . the experiment was then repeated in biological triplicates collecting samples  <dig> days after infiltration and lipid extracts were analyzed by hplc-ms. the amount of oxidized species in the control samples was nearly detectable, whereas the presence of the grapevine enzyme caused a statistically significant increase of galactolipid peroxidation . the amount of peroxidized galactolipids was normalized to the amount of pnloxa protein actually present in each replicate  and used to calculate the average peroxidation value. as in grapevine berry skin, also in tobacco leaves mgdg seem preferentially oxidized; however in the latter, di-oxidized galactolipids accumulate more than mono-oxidized species .

discussion
the transition from mature green to ripening berries is a crucial developmental phase in grapevine, as well as in many fleshy fruits, because it involves broad metabolic reprogramming and definitive specialization. internal signals  refined by external cues trigger a set of integrated regulatory cascades, possibly including a burst of oxidative stress, at the transition to the ripening phase  <cit> . this study definitely confirms the transient accumulation of h2o <dig> in the cytosol of berry skin cells at the beginning of ripening and shows the concomitant accumulation of 1o <dig> inside chloroplasts , where also enzymatic peroxidation of membrane galactolipids occurs.

although it is difficult to measure h2o <dig> in plant tissues accurately  <cit> , it clearly accumulates in berry skin at softening and color change . basal levels are probably restored by the activity of a catalase isoform which is specifically expressed and active since  <dig> wpf . this catalase isoform resembles arabidopsis cat <dig>  which is stress- and substrate-inducible and is expressed at bolting time, when a peak of h2o <dig> occurs in the leaves and senescence is triggered  <cit> . we have no evidence to attribute the accumulation of h2o <dig> to a down-regulation of scavenger activities, at least of catalase, rather we might speculate about an increase in ros production at ripening onset. potential sources could be chloroplasts, which are undergoing a transition to non-photosynthetic organelles, or mitochondria, which transiently shift to an aerobic fermentative metabolism  <cit> .

h2o <dig> accumulation and catalase activity are reported also at bud-break in grapevine  <cit> , where the role of h2o <dig> as a signal molecule in the release of buds endodormancy has been proposed.

in plants, 1o <dig> is usually generated at photosystem ii by energy transfer from excited triplet chlorophylls to triplet oxygen  under photo-oxidative conditions  <cit> . at the onset of ripening, a developmentally regulated switch off of photosynthesis occurs and 1o <dig> is likely to be generated. quite unexpectedly, we do not detect significant oxidative damage on thylakoid membrane lipids attributable to 1o <dig>  rather the lipoxygenase-mediated accumulation of 13-peroxy galactolipids . at  <dig> wpf, 6% of the mgdg and  <dig> % of the dgdg are oxidized on one chain and nearly 2% of the mgdg are oxidized on both chains . a grapevine plastidial 13-lipoxygenase  probably responsible for the transient galactolipid peroxidation in pinot noir grapes has been identified. it differs at only five out of  <dig> residues from the sauvignon blanc orthologue  <cit> . the véraison-specific expression profile of this lox isoform  was already highlighted in a proteomic study which proposed it as a biomarker of grapevine ripening  <cit> . according to the vitis atlas  <cit>  other two 13-lox genes are expressed in the berry, but with a descending profile from fruit set to full ripening. moreover, one of these, loxo, is induced by abiotic and biotic stresses, such as wounding and botrytis infection  <cit>  and is regulated by vvwrky <dig> in response to downy mildew  <cit> . an important feature of pnloxa is the ability to peroxidize membrane galactolipids both in vitro and in vivo  and not only free fatty acid chains, as it is usually assumed. moreover, pnloxa causes the preferential accumulation of di-oxidized forms of mgdg and dgdg. we can thus conclude that in the fruit skin the di-oxidized mgdg do not accumulate due to a very fast scavenging or conversion. similar conclusions were reported for arabidopsis chloroplastic lipoxygenase lox <dig>  <cit> . the study of lox <dig> mutant suggested that lox <dig> could directly oxidize membrane galactolipids and that di-oxidized forms were strictly related to its presence, whereas mono-oxidized forms accumulation occurred also in a lox <dig> background. finally, the preferential accumulation of oxidized mgdg was observed: we speculate that this phenomenon could be related to a plat-mediated specific localization of pnloxa at the thylakoid , rather than to substrate discrimination. in fact, mgdg and dgdg have distinct structural properties and distribution in the membrane and there are proteins known to interact preferentially with mgdg, such as violaxanthin de-epoxidase and cytochrome b6f  <cit> .

the biological function of enzymatically generated membrane peroxy-lipids in the chloroplast at the onset of ripening is not clear yet. usually peroxidation occurs on free fatty acid chains and generates, through catalyzed or spontaneous reactions, compounds called oxylipins, among which the hormone jasmonic acid  <cit> . the signaling function of oxylipins is well established, as many studies have demonstrated their influence on physiological processes such as root development and plant defense in arabidopsis  <cit>  and light acclimation in chlamydomonas  <cit> . besides, some oxylipins are volatile aromatic compounds, such as c <dig> volatile aldehydes, alcohols and esters, which confers the characteristic flavors to fruits including grapes and wine  <cit> . in tomato, a chloroplastic lox expressed in the fruit at the moment of color change, named tomloxc , has been related to the aroma flavor of ripe fruits  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis based on protein sequence similarity shows that tomloxc and pnloxa belong to the same group of chloroplastic 13-lox , suggesting they could have conserved functions in the two fruits. the observation that their expression pattern is centered at véraison rather than at ripening, when the aroma are accumulated, and that tomloxc is directly activated by the mads box transcription factor rin, which is a major regulator of the onset of ripening in tomato  <cit> , strongly support the hypothesis of these loxs participation to fruit development signaling. moreover, the peculiarity of pnloxa of peroxidizing membrane lipids instead of free fatty acid chains allows to speculate on at least other two possible functions of peroxy-lipids. on the one hand, membrane peroxidation could undergo fragmentation and generate a particular class of oxylipins, namely phytoprostanes with signaling function  <cit> , while on the other hand it could regulate membrane proteins activity by reversible oxidation of active-site cysteines, as reported for a human protein tyrosine phosphatase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work sheds light on the oxidative species transiently accumulating in the skin of grapevine berries at the onset of ripening. skin cells are continuously exposed to solar radiation, even during the programmed dismantling of the photosynthetic apparatus at the onset of ripening. in this transitional phase, ros could exceed skin cells scavenging capacity, accumulate and affect the transcription of nuclear genes involved in photo-protection and ros-scavenging. besides, the enzymatic peroxidation of thylacoidal membranes may represent the first step in oxylipin synthesis or a mechanism to regulate membrane proteins through redox control.
