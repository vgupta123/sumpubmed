BACKGROUND
chlamydiae are a large group of obligate intracellular bacteria that includes human pathogens , animal pathogens , or symbionts of free-living amoebae. among chlamydiae, c. trachomatis is a particular clinical and public health concern, being the leading cause of infectious blindness in developing countries  <cit>  and the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacteria worldwide  <cit> .

like all chlamydiae, c. trachomatis undergoes a developmental cycle involving the inter-conversion between two morphologically distinct forms: a non-replicative infectious form, the elementary body , and a replicative non-infectious form, the reticulate body   <cit> . throughout its developmental cycle, c. trachomatis uses a type iii secretion system  to translocate several effector proteins across the host cell plasma membrane and the inclusion membrane  <cit> . these t3s effectors are thought to play a central role in bacterial invasion  <cit>  and exit of host cells  <cit> , and in the subversion of various host cell processes  <cit> . there are, however, chlamydial effectors, such as cpaf/ct <dig> or ct <dig>  which are not t3s substrates  <cit> .

given their likely central role during infection, considerable efforts have been placed at identifying chlamydial effectors. this is not a trivial task because the amino acid sequence of most effectors does not display significant similarity to proteins of known function. additionally, t3s substrates, which should comprise the bulk of chlamydia effectors, contain no easily recognizable secretion signal. moreover, in spite of the recent development of systems for transformation of chlamydia <cit> , for a long time no methods have been available for genetic manipulation of these bacteria. to overcome these obstacles, chlamydial effectors have been searched: i) by systematic phenotypic analyses of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing individual chlamydial proteins  <cit> ; ii) by using salmonella <cit> , shigella <cit> , or yersinia <cit>  as genetically tractable heterologous host bacteria carrying well characterized t3sss; or iii) by complex computational predictions of t3s signals  <cit> . the subsequent use of specific antibodies enabled to detect translocation into host cells of some of the c. trachomatis proteins singled out in these searches, such as in the case of tarp/ct <dig>  <cit> , ct <dig>  <cit> , copn/ct <dig>  <cit> , cap1/ct <dig>  <cit> , ct <dig>  <cit> , ct <dig>  <cit> , ct <dig>  <cit> , lipid-droplet associated  proteins lda1/ct <dig>  lda2/ct <dig>  and lda3/ct <dig>  <cit> , nue/ct <dig>  <cit> , or of a group of proteins containing a hydrophobic motif thought to mediate their insertion into the inclusion membrane   <cit> . moreover, the direct use of antibodies raised against particular c. trachomatis proteins  revealed their presence in the host cell cytosol or nucleus of infected cells  <cit> . finally, the in vitro deubiquitinase activity of chladub1/ct <dig> and of chladub2/ct <dig>  <cit> , and the capacity of chladub1/ct <dig> to suppress the nf-κb pathway in transfected cells  <cit> , indicate that these two proteins should be effectors.

in this work, we have surveyed the genome of c. trachomatis mostly for genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that were not described before as t3s substrates. we then used yersinia enterocolitica as a heterologous system to identify  <dig> novel likely t3s substrates of c. trachomatis and real-time quantitative pcr  to show that  <dig> of the genes encoding these proteins are clearly expressed during the bacterial developmental cycle. furthermore, we showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> likely t3s substrates of c. trachomatis could be translocated into host cells by y. enterocolitica. therefore, we identified several novel putative effectors of c. trachomatis.

methods
cell culture, bacterial strains and growth conditions
hela  <dig>  cells were maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10%  foetal bovine serum  at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5%  co <dig>  c. trachomatis l2/434/bu  was propagated in hela  <dig> cells using standard techniques  <cit> . escherichia coli top <dig>  was used for construction and purification of the plasmids. yersinia enterocolitica Δhopemt , deficient for the yersinia t3s effectors yoph, o, p, e, m, and t, but t3s-proficient  <cit>  and t3s-deficient y. enterocolitica Δhopemt Δyscu   <cit>  were used for t3s assays. the yscu gene encodes an essential component of the y. enterocolitica t3s system, and the yscuΔ1- <dig> mutation is non-polar  <cit> . e. coli or y. enterocolitica were routinely grown in liquid or solid luria-bertani  medium  with the appropriate antibiotics and supplements. plasmids were introduced into e. coli or y. enterocolitica by electroporation.

dna manipulations, plasmids, and primers
the plasmids used in this work and their main characteristics are detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the dna primers used in their construction are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  plasmids were constructed and purified with proof-reading phusion dna polymerase , restriction enzymes , t <dig> dna ligase , dreamtaq dna polymerase , dna clean & concentrator™- <dig> kit and zymoclean™ gel dna recovery kit , and purified with geneelute plasmid miniprep kit , according to the instructions of the manufacturers. in brief, to analyze t3s signals we constructed plasmids harboring hybrid genes encoding the first  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> amino acids of each protein  and the mature form of tem- <dig> β-lactamase   <cit> . these hybrids were made using as vector pljm <dig>  a low-copy plasmid which enables expression of the cloned genes driven by the promoter of the y. enterocolitica yope gene  <cit> , either by overlapping pcr or by using a cloning strategy previously described for the construction of plasmids encoding inc-tem- <dig> hybrid proteins  <cit> . to analyze secretion of full-length c. trachomatis proteins, we constructed plasmids expressing the proteins c-terminally tagged with a haemagglutinin  epitope. for this, the genes were amplified by pcr from chromosomal dna of strain l2/434/bu using a reverse primer with a sequence complementary to the transcribed strand of the dna encoding the ha-epitope. pcr products digested with the appropriate enzymes were ligated into pljm <dig>  <cit> . the accuracy of the nucleotide sequence of all the inserts in the constructed plasmids was checked by dna sequencing.

y. enterocolitica t3s assays
t3s assays were done as previously described  <cit> . we used y. enterocolitica Δhopemt or Δhopemt Δyscu strains carrying the plasmids described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the proteins in bacterial pellets and culture supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting, and the amounts of protein in bacterial pellets and/or culture supernatants were estimated from images of immunoblots with image lab . where appropriate, we calculated the percentage of secretion as the ratio between the amounts of secreted protein  relative to the total amount of protein . the results from the quantifications are the average ± standard error of the mean  from at least three independent experiments. detailed results for each protein analyzed are in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

y. enterocolitica translocation assays
analyses of protein translocation into host cells by y. enterocolitica were done essentially as previously described  <cit> . in brief, y. enterocolitica strains were grown in brain heart infusion  medium overnight at 26°c with continuous shaking . bacteria were then diluted to an optical density at 600 nm of  <dig>  in fresh bhi and cultured in the same conditions for 2 h. subsequently, the yop regulon was induced by incubation for 30 min in a shaking water bath  at 37°c. bacteria were then washed with dmem supplemented with 10%  fbs and added to hela  <dig> cells, grown overnight in 24-well plates , by using a multiplicity of infection of  <dig>  the infected cells were incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5%  co <dig>  after 3 h of incubation, extracellular bacteria were killed by adding gentamicin , and the cells were incubated in the same conditions for additional 2 h. the infected cells were then harvested on ice, washed with phosphate-buffered saline , ressuspended in pbs containing  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> and a protease inhibitor cocktail , and incubated for 10 min on ice. the samples were centrifuged  and triton-soluble and triton-insoluble hela cell lysates were loaded on sodium dodecyl sulfate-12%  polyacrilamide gels. after electrophoresis, the gels were processed for immunoblotting using  <dig>  μm pore-size nitrocellulose membranes .

immunoblotting
the following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: rat monoclonal anti-ha , mouse monoclonal anti-tem- <dig> , rabbit polyclonal anti-syco   <cit> , and mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin . immunoblot detection was done with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies , western lightning plus-ecl , and a chemidoc xrs + system  or exposure to amersham hyperfilm ecl . all quantitative analyses were done with immunoblot images obtained using chemidoc xrs + .

real-time quantitative pcr
the expression of the newly identified candidate t3s substrates during the developmental cycle of c. trachomatis l2/ <dig> was estimated by determining mrna levels at different times post-infection by real-time quantitative pcr . these experiments were done as previously described  <cit> . primers  were designed using primer express . the rt-qpcr assays were done using the abi  <dig> sds, sybr green chemistry, and optical plates , as previously described  <cit> . at each time point, raw rt-qpcr data for each gene were normalized against the data obtained for the 16s rrna transcript, as it was previously demonstrated that this is an adequate endogenous control  <cit> . the final results were based on three independent experiments.

RESULTS
selection of c. trachomatis proteins analyzed in this work
to search for previously unidentified t3s substrates of c. trachomatis, we first surveyed the genome of strain l2/ <dig> for genes encoding mostly uncharacterized proteins, or with a putative biochemical activity compatible with the function of a t3s effector . among these genes, we selected those encoding proteins not predicted to have a signal sequence characteristic of the general secretory pathway  and that had not been previously analyzed experimentally for the presence of a t3s signal. this singled out  <dig> proteins . furthermore, for comparison purposes, we considered proteins that had been tested for the presence of a t3s signal using shigella flexneri as a heterologous bacteria: eight proteins whose first ~ <dig> amino acids of the corresponding c. pneumoniae homologs did not drive secretion of an adenylate cyclase  reporter protein by s. flexneri , and three proteins whose n-terminal region of the c. pneumoniae homologs drove secretion of a cya reporter protein by s. flexneri   <cit> . please note that at the time this work was initiated grga/ct <dig> was an uncharacterized protein; however, it was recently described as a transcriptional activator  <cit> . finally, throughout this study we used as positive controls a c. trachomatis bona-fide t3s effector   <cit>  and a c. trachomatis likely t3s substrate  that we had previously identified  <cit> , and which was recently independently confirmed  <cit> , and as negative control a predicted ribosomal protein .

in summary, in experiments that will be described below, we analyzed t3s signals in  <dig> c. trachomatis proteins :  <dig> hypothetical proteins previously not analyzed experimentally for t3s signals,  <dig> proteins whose c. pneumoniae homologs were previously analyzed for t3s signals using s. flexneri as heterologous system, and  <dig> controls. in the selection of these proteins, we did not consider predictions made by any of the published in silico methods that suggest putative t3s substrates  <cit> .

the first  <dig> amino acids of c. trachomatis t3s substrates are sufficient to drive efficient secretion of tem- <dig> hybrid proteins by y. enterocolitica
we previously used tem- <dig> as a reporter protein to analyze t3s signals in c. trachomatis inc proteins, using y. enterocolitica as a heterologous system  <cit> . however, before analyzing t3s signals in the proteins that we selected to study in this work , we sought to ascertain the optimal amino acid length of the chlamydial t3s signal that drives secretion of tem- <dig> hybrid proteins in yersinia. for this, we analyzed secretion of hybrid proteins comprising the first  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids of known c. trachomatis t3s substrates  fused to tem- <dig>  by t3s-proficient  or t3s-deficient  y. enterocolitica . as negative controls we analyzed secretion by y. enterocolitica Δhopemt of tem- <dig> alone and of a hybrid protein comprising the first  <dig> amino acids of the yersinia t3s chaperone syct to tem- <dig> , and as positive control we analyzed secretion by Δhopemt of a fusion of the first  <dig> amino acids of the yersinia effector yope to tem- <dig>  , an archetypal t3s signal  <cit> . bacteria expressing these proteins were incubated under t3s-inducing conditions, as described in methods. as expected, and in agreement to what we previously reported  <cit> , mature tem- <dig> alone was not secreted and the syct20-tem- <dig> fusion showed a percentage of secretion of  <dig>  . based on this, to decide if a tem- <dig> hybrid was secreted or not, we set the threshold of percentage of secretion to  <dig> . the six inc-tem- <dig> hybrid proteins were type iii secreted . however, inca10-tem- <dig> and incc10-tem- <dig> were secreted less efficiently than yope15-tem- <dig>  while inca20-tem- <dig>  inca40-tem- <dig>  incc20-tem- <dig> and incc40-tem- <dig> were secreted at levels comparable to yope15-tem- <dig> . overall, these experiments indicated that the first  <dig> amino acids of c. trachomatis t3s substrates are sufficient to drive secretion of tem- <dig> hybrid proteins by y. enterocolitica Δhopemt as efficiently as the first  <dig> amino acids of the yersinia effector yope.

identification of t3s signals in c. trachomatis proteins
to identify t3s signals in the selected  <dig> c. trachomatis proteins, we analyzed secretion of fusions to tem- <dig> of the first  <dig> amino acids of each of these proteins by t3s-proficient y. enterocolitica Δhopemt. these experiments revealed  <dig> c. trachomatis proteins whose first  <dig> amino acids drove secretion of tem- <dig> hybrid proteins by y. enterocolitica . owing to lack of expression, or very low expression levels, it was not possible to conclude if the tem- <dig> hybrids comprising the n-terminal region of ct <dig>  ct <dig> and ct <dig> were secreted . by individually introducing the plasmids encoding the tem- <dig> hybrid proteins that were secreted into t3s-deficient y. enterocolitica Δhopemt Δyscu and performing t3s assays, we confirmed that secretion of the proteins was dependent on a functional t3ss . the percentage of secretion of the different hybrid proteins that were secreted varied considerable, between 56%  for ct69420-tem- <dig> to 5%  for ct14320-tem- <dig> . overall, this confirmed a t3s signal in ct <dig>  which has been previously shown to be a t3s substrate  <cit> , and revealed t3s signals in  <dig> previously t3s substrates of c. trachomatis.

analysis of the secretion of the newly identified candidate t3s substrates of c. trachomatis as full-length proteins
we next analyzed if the  <dig> c. trachomatis proteins carrying newly identified t3s signals, and also ct <dig> and the controls , were secreted as full-length proteins by y. enterocolitica Δhopemt. the rationale for these experiments was that some proteins cannot be type iii secreted even with a t3s signal grafted at their n-termini  <cit> , possibly because the secretion channel is too narrow  to accommodate tightly folded proteins. for example, while we showed that yope15-tem- <dig> is efficiently type iii secreted, hybrid proteins containing the first  <dig> or  <dig> amino acids of yope fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase  are not type iii secreted by y. enterocolitica <cit> . this indicates that most t3s substrates must have particular folding properties that are compatible with them being type iii secreted proteins. based on this, we predicted that if the full-length version of chlamydial proteins were type iii secreted by yersinia this would be an additional indication that they can be t3s substrates. however, lack of secretion of the full-length proteins would not preclude that they could be t3s substrates, as they may require chlamydia-specific chaperones, not present in yersinia <cit> .

to analyze secretion of full-length c. trachomatis proteins by y. enterocolitica we used plasmids expressing the chlamydial proteins with an ha tag at their c-termini. the plasmids were introduced into y. enterocolitica Δhopemt and t3s assays were performed. in these experiments, the percentage of secretion of the positive controls  was between 20-30% and the percentage of secretion of the negative control  was  <dig> % . based on these results, in experiments involving full-length proteins of newly identified chlamydial t3s substrates we set a conservative threshold of 2% to decide whether a protein was secreted or not. this defined a group of  <dig> proteins that in their full-length version were secreted by y. enterocolitica Δhopemt: ct053-ha, ct105-ha, ct142-ha, ct143-ha, ct144-ha, ct161-ha, ct338-ha, ct429-ha, ct583-ha, ct656-ha, and ct849-ha . to test if secretion of these proteins was dependent on a functional t3ss, the plasmids carrying their encoding genes, as well as plasmids encoding positive controls ct694-ha or ct082-ha, were individually introduced into t3s-deficient y. enterocolitica Δhopemt Δyscu. with the exception of ct583-ha, which for unknown reasons was very poorly expressed by y. enterocolitica Δhopemt Δyscu, these assays indicated that the other  <dig> proteins analyzed were type iii secreted .

secretion of full-length ct153-ha, ct172-ha, ct203-ha, ct386-ha or ct425-ha by y. enterocolitica could occasionally be seen by immunoblotting ; however, this was not always reproducible and individual average percentage of secretion of these proteins was in all cases below 2% . we did not detect significant amounts of ct273-ha, ct289-ha, ct309-ha, or ct631-ha in culture supernatants , but as their levels of expression were either extremely low  or undetectable  it was not possible to draw conclusions about secretion of these proteins. furthermore, ct016-ha, and possibly ct696-ha , were immunodetected in the culture supernatant fraction in a form that migrated on sds-page at a molecular weight much lower than the one predicted from their amino acid sequence , while in the bacterial pellet fraction their migration on sds-page corresponded roughly to their predicted molecular weight . this suggests that the proteins could be cleaved during secretion, unstable in the culture supernatant, or their encoding genes possess internal shine-dalgarno sequences. regardless of the exact reason, we could not confidently analyze whether ct016-ha and ct696-ha were secreted or not.

overall, the full set of t3s assays revealed  <dig> proteins  as newly identified likely t3s substrates of c. trachomatis, and therefore as possible effectors.

ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> can be translocated into host cells by y. enterocolitica
we next analyzed if the newly identified likely t3s substrates of c. trachomatis had the capacity of being translocated into host cells, by using y. enterocolitica as a heterologous system. for this, y. enterocolitica Δhopemt harboring plasmids encoding c-terminal ha-tagged newly identified likely t3s substrates of c. trachomatis , a positive control  or a negative control , were used to infect human epithelial hela cells. we then used triton x- <dig> fractionation of the infected cells followed by immunoblotting analysis of triton-soluble and insoluble hela cell lysates to monitor protein translocation into host cells. as expected, we found ct694-ha in the triton-soluble fraction, which showed that this protein was delivered into the cytoplasm of hela cells, and only detected rplj-ha in the triton-insoluble fraction , which confirmed that this protein remained within the bacteria . among the  <dig> likely t3s substrates of c. trachomatis under analysis, we could not detect ct656-ha or ct849-ha in both the triton-soluble and triton-insoluble fractions. it is possible that in the experimental conditions used in this study ct656-ha or ct849-ha are translocated in minute and undetectable amounts and/or that they are degraded either after translocation or within the bacteria. regardless of the exact scenario, these results did not enable us to conclude about the capacity of ct656-ha and ct849-ha of being translocated into host cells. however, we could consistently detect ct053-ha, ct105-ha, ct142-ha, ct143-ha, ct161-ha, ct338-ha and ct429-ha in the triton-soluble fraction , indicating that these proteins were injected into the cytoplasm of hela cells by y. enterocolitica. we could also occasionally detect small amounts of ct144-ha in the triton-soluble fraction .

in summary, these experiments showed that ct053-ha, ct105-ha, ct142-ha, ct143-ha, ct161-ha, ct338-ha and ct429-ha have the capacity of being translocated into infected host cells further suggesting that the endogenous c. trachomatis proteins could be effectors. the results do not preclude that ct <dig>  ct <dig> or ct <dig> could be effectors, but the evidence is not as strong as for the other  <dig> proteins.

expression of genes encoding newly identified likely t3s substrates during development of c. trachomatis
to test if the newly identified likely t3s substrates, and possible effectors, of c. trachomatis  were expressed during infection, and to gain insights of when they could be acting during the developmental cycle, we analyzed by rt-qpcr the mrna levels of their encoding genes during the developmental cycle of strain l2/ <dig>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 42 h post-infection. while ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> displayed significant mrna levels in more than one of the time-points analyzed, ct <dig> showed only vestigial levels of expression throughout the cycle . the mrna levels of ct <dig> and ct <dig> were < 5-fold higher at 2–6 h post-infection than in any other of the time-points analyzed , suggesting that the encoded proteins should function at early-cycle. the mrna levels of ct <dig> and ct <dig> were higher between  <dig> and 20 h post-infection , suggesting that the encoded proteins might act from early to mid cycle. the mrna levels of ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig> and ct <dig> were higher at the later time points analyzed . however, while ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> were expressed at similar levels at  <dig> and 42 h post-infection, ct <dig> showed a distinct peak of expression at 30 h post-infection . therefore, ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig> could function either at late or early cycle, and ct <dig> might probably acts at late cycle. finally, the mrna levels of ct <dig> were constant at all time-points analyzed , suggesting that ct <dig> could function throughout the cycle. regarding ct <dig>  when comparing the higher mrna levels detected for each of the genes analyzed, those of ct <dig> were < 6-fold lower than those of any of the other genes tested . therefore, in the experimental conditions used, ct <dig> may not be expressed by strain l2/ <dig>  in summary, the rt-qpcr experiments supported that ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig>  and also ct <dig>  ct <dig>  or ct <dig>  could be c. trachomatis t3s effectors, possibly acting at different times of the developmental cycle.

discussion
earlier studies using heterologous systems have led to the identification of several bona-fide or putative c. trachomatis t3s effectors  <cit> . while these and other analyses covered a significant portion of all c. trachomatis proteins, we hypothesized that there could be previously unidentified t3s substrates. by combining basic bioinformatics searches, exhaustive t3s assays, translocation assays, and analyses of chlamydial gene expression in infected cells, we revealed  <dig> c. trachomatis proteins  as likely t3s substrates and possible effectors. in particular, ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> were type iii secreted by y. enterocolitica, could be translocated into host cells, and their encoding genes were clearly expressed in c. trachomatis strain l2/ <dig>  therefore, these  <dig> proteins have a high likelihood of being effectors. however, additional future studies are required to show that all of these  <dig> proteins are indeed translocated by c. trachomatis into host cells and to show that they are bona-fide effectors, i.e., that they interfere with host cell processes.

among the likely t3s effectors of c. trachomatis that we identified, ct <dig> and ct <dig> have been previously singled out as possible modulators of host cell functions, based on the phenotypic consequences of their ectopic expression in yeast s. cerevisiae <cit> . in addition, the genes encoding ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> have been shown to be markedly transcriptionally regulated by a protein  encoded by the chlamydia virulence plasmid  <cit> . this plasmid is present in almost all c. trachomatis clinical isolates  <cit> , and studies in animal models of infection showed that it is a virulence factor in vivo <cit> . additional studies are needed to understand if the putative effector function of ct <dig>  ct <dig>  and ct <dig> can partially explain the virulence role of the chlamydial plasmid. furthermore, the predicted amino acid sequence of ct <dig> reveals a domain of unknown function  that can only be found in chlamydia proteins. in c. trachomatis, besides ct <dig>  a duf <dig> domain is found in ct <dig>  a t3s effector that interacts with human grap <dig> cyclin d-interacting protein   <cit> , and in ct <dig>  which has been indicated as a t3s substrate using s. flexneri as a heterologous system  <cit> . therefore, this further supports a possible role of ct <dig> as an effector. in contrast with ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig> or ct <dig>  no significant information is available or could be retrieved about ct <dig>  ct <dig>  ct <dig>  or ct <dig> 

ct <dig> is a possible t3s substrate and effector, but we could not detect significant levels of ct <dig> mrna during the developmental cycle of strain l2/ <dig>  the ct <dig> gene is localized within the “plasticity zone”, a chromosomal region of rare high genetic diversity among c. trachomatis strains. in fact, although c. trachomatis includes strains showing remarkably different tropisms , their genomes are all highly similar  <cit> . preliminary data indicate that, contrarily to what is seen in lgv strains, the ct <dig> seems to be more expressed in some ocular and urogenital isolates . we are currently investigating the possibility that ct <dig> is a pseudogene in lgv strains, perhaps inactivated by a mutation in its promoter region. interestingly, ct <dig> has been shown by yeast two-hybrid to bind ct <dig>   <cit> . another feature of this protein is that part of its amino acid sequence  shows 28% of identity to a region of lda2/ct <dig> , a known c. trachomatis translocated protein  <cit> .

among the proteins for which we found a secretion signal but could not demonstrate their t3s as full-length proteins, we highlight ct <dig> and grga/ct <dig>  regarding ct <dig>  this protein possesses a membrane attack complex/perforin  domain  <cit> , and there is previous evidence that it may be translocated by c. trachomatis <cit> , which is consistent with our data. the ct <dig> gene has been recently shown to encode a transcriptional activator, grga  <cit> . therefore, t3s of ct50420-tem- <dig> could be false a positive. however, if grga is a t3s substrate, as our data suggests, it could have a function within the host cell or, more likely and similarly to what has been described in the t3sss of yersinia <cit>  or shigella <cit> , it could be discarded by secretion once its intra-bacterial regulatory activity needs to be shut down.

we found t3s signals in 56% proteins analyzed . this high percentage of proteins showing a t3s signal suggests that some should be false positives. it is conceivable that within a single bacterium non-secreted proteins possess t3s signals but are not targeted to the t3ss machinery because they also carry signals  that preferentially direct them to other location within the bacterial cell. to help differentiating between true or false positives among chlamydial proteins carrying a t3s signal we analyzed their secretion as full-length proteins. this is because, as explained above in the results section, not all proteins have folding characteristics compatible with t3s  <cit> . however, we cannot exclude that some of the c. trachomatis full-length proteins that were not type iii secreted by yersinia have a t3s chaperone that maintains them in a secretion-competent state  <cit>  and enables their secretion during infection by c. trachomatis. intriguingly, ct <dig> or ct <dig> have dedicated t3s chaperones, ct <dig> and slc <dig>  respectively  <cit> , and, in agreement with what we previously observed  <cit> , they were both secreted as full-length proteins in the absence of the chaperones. considering that t3s chaperones have various functions  <cit> , the chaperone role of ct <dig> or slc <dig> should be different from maintaining their substrates in a secretion-competent state.

eleven of the chlamydia proteins that we analyzed have been previously studied for t3s using s. flexneri has a heterologous system  <cit> . in the majority of the cases the outcome of the experiments was identical; however, differently from what was shown in shigella, we detected a t3s signal in the n-terminal of ct <dig> , grga/ct <dig>  and ct <dig> and we did not detect a t3s signal in ct <dig>  evidence for a t3s signal in only one of the heterologous systems may suggest a false positive. however, there is a myriad of possible explanations for these discrepancies, when considering that different heterologous systems  and reporter proteins  were used, and that the n-terminal regions in the hybrid proteins consisted in different lengths of amino acids and were in some cases from different chlamydia species.

we compared the data from our t3s assays  with predictions of t3s substrates by in silico methods  using resources available in the web  and table three in reference  <cit>  , as detailed in additional file 3: table s <dig>  when considering the analysis of t3s signals in tem- <dig> hybrids, the vast majority of proteins  in which we did not find a t3s signal were also predicted not to be secreted by each of the in silico methods. in contrast, the vast majority of proteins  in which we detected a t3s signal were also predicted to be secreted by at least one of the in silico methods. the correlation between our experimental data and the in silico predictions was more striking when considering the t3s of full-length proteins. among the  <dig> full-length proteins for which we could not find definitive evidence of t3s,  <dig>  were also predicted not to be secreted by each of the in silico methods, but among the  <dig> proteins that we showed or confirmed to be t3s substrates,  <dig>  were also predicted to be secreted by at least one of the in silico methods. overall, this indicates some correlation between our experimental data and the in silico methods that predict t3s substrates. however, for many proteins, each of these in silico methods generates different predictions . it is possible that the quantitative data on t3s such as the one we generated in this and in a previous study  <cit> , can be used to normalize and improve the predictive value of such methods.

CONCLUSIONS
we found  <dig> c. trachomatis proteins  with a high likelihood of being t3s substrates, and therefore possible effectors delivered by the bacteria into host cells. for  <dig> of these proteins , the hypothesis that they could be effectors was supported by their capacity of being translocated into host cells and by the expression of their encoding genes by c. trachomatis. the identification of all c. trachomatis effectors is a crucial step towards a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which this pathogen subverts host cells. the recently developed methods for genetic manipulation of chlamydia indicate that it should be possible to ectopically express candidate effectors in c. trachomatis <cit> , which would facilitate the analysis of their translocation into host cells. our work highlights c. trachomatis proteins that should be prioritized in such studies, thus aiding the future identification of chlamydial effectors. furthermore, the quantitative analysis of t3s of tem- <dig> hybrid proteins that we carried out could help to further develop the in silico methods for identification of t3s substrates  <cit> .
