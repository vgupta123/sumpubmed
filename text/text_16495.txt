BACKGROUND
blood vessels are important for transporting oxygen and nutrients to cells for survival and proper functioning. in early embryos, the pioneer trunk vessels, the dorsal aorta and cardinal vein, develop from vascular endothelial cells derived from the lateral plate mesoderm through a process called vasculogenesis. subsequently, blood vessels grow from existing vessels, through a process referred to as angiogenesis, into peripheral tissues and developing organs  <cit> . in developing embryos, increasing evidence has revealed that blood vessels also provide signals for the proper morphogenesis of developing organs  <cit> . in the adult form of organisms, angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis to regrow blood vessels in wounded tissues is needed to repair damaged and replace lost tissues  <cit> . in humans, it has been well documented that angiogenesis plays a vital role in tumor growth, and thus the potential of antiangiogenesis drugs to inhibit tumor growth has been extensively explored worldwide  <cit> .

during angiogenesis, vascular branching is one of the key morphogenetic events, which presumably is responsible for constructing a complex vascular network which assures that blood is available to every single cell. despite its important role in sustaining organismic development throughout life, the genetic mechanism of blood vessel branching is largely unknown partly due to the intricate interactions between molecular signals and numerous cell types that are involved in angiogenesis, e.g., multiple cellular activities, including cell proliferation, migration, extension, and possibly cell fate specification all of which require signaling through multiple growth factors such as vegf, fgf, pdgf, and egf. interactions between blood vessel endothelial cells and neighboring cells and even cells in the bloodstream can also regulate angiogenesis  <cit> . more recently, it has been implied that immune-mediated cells and molecules can influence blood vessel growth in adults. for example, mast cells have been found to aggregate at sites of active angiogenesis under both physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . histamine has been determined to be an angiogenic factor  <cit>  and is thought to be directly involved in tumor growth based on findings of high expression levels and enzymatic activity of the key histamine synthesis enzyme, histidine decarboxylase, in numerous growing tumors, such as small-cell lung carcinoma  <cit> . in fact, clinical trials have shown that histamine h <dig> receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine and ranitidine, increase the survival of gastric and colon cancer patients  <cit> . it has also been reported that histamine regulates angiogenesis at the level of cell proliferation and cell permeability  <cit> . thus, histamine seems to be involved in multiple cellular and molecular interactions during angiogenesis. it is still unclear whether histamine can influence blood vessel branching during angiogenesis, and if it does, through which intracellular signaling pathway it works.

in this report, we took a chemical genetic approach to reveal the role of histamine in vascular branching using a zebrafish reg <dig> mutation which causes specific vascular branching defects without affecting endothelial cell proliferation  <cit> . we show that vessel branching defects in reg <dig> mutants can be rescued by a high level of histamine either directly added to the water or by inhibiting histamine degradation using a histamine methyltransferase  inhibitor. on the other hand, blocking histamine synthesis by a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor enhanced the reg <dig> vessel phenotypes. finally, we show that the expression level of the egr- <dig> transcription factor, but not the vegf family, is strongly correlated with the reg <dig> phenotypes, suggesting that histamine might modulate blood vessel branching by regulating egr- <dig> levels.

RESULTS
specific blood vessel branching defect of the zebrafish reg <dig> mutation
the zebrafish reg <dig> mutation was isolated by its defects during caudal fin regeneration  <cit> . it was previously shown that the reg <dig> mutation causes blood vessel dilation during plexus formation of vessel regeneration due to defects in blood vessel branching, not in cell proliferation  <cit> . herein, we further tested whether the reg <dig> vessel branching phenotype might be due to or might cause the cell migration defect by measuring the distance endothelial cells were able to migrate at different stages of blood vessel regeneration. upon amputation, blood vessels undergo wound healing to seal the ends within the first  <dig> h followed by sprouting to reconnect the severed vessels and resume blood circulation at the amputation site. blood vessel endothelial cells then proliferate and begin to migrate into the regenerating tissues to form a vascular plexus  <cit> . we found that regenerating endothelial cells in both wild-type and reg <dig> fish are able to migrate more than  <dig>  mm within  <dig> days post amputation   when the swollen vessel lumen phenotype has just begun to develop , suggesting that vessel dilation is not due to a cell migration defect. when the same fish were measured again at  <dig> dpa, we found that endothelial cells in reg <dig> fish had migrated more than  <dig>  mm, which was similar to that in wild-type fish  despite significantly swollen vessels having developed . thus, the formation of swollen vessel lumina in reg <dig> fish does not seem to cause cell migration defects, at least up to  <dig> dpa. cross-sections of reg <dig> regenerating fins revealed enlarged lumina in most of the regenerating vessels .

to understand the cellular defects in angiogenic endothelial cells of reg <dig> mutants, we examined the cell integrity by whole-mount and transmission electron microscopy . we first noted that the permeability of reg <dig> endothelial cells seemed defective as leaked blood cells were often observed in reg <dig> regenerating fins . in addition, while endothelial cells stretch thin and form tight junctions and intact enclosed blood vessels of different sizes in wild-type regenerating fins , reg <dig> endothelial cells did not appear as stretched-out as those in the wild-type and seldom formed obvious tight junction . taken together, our current and previous  <cit>  results suggest that reg <dig> function is specifically required for cell elongation and the formation of tight junctions between endothelial cells that are essential for blood vessel branching morphogenesis.

isolation of a chemical suppressor of the reg <dig> mutation
a similar swollen-vessel phenotype was also observed in developing caudal veins of reg <dig> mutants during embryogenesis . in wild-type embryos, the posterior cardinal vein branches to form a transient capillary plexus beginning at around  <dig> h post fertilization  , which is typically located ventral to the dorsal aorta in the tail and is comprised of  <dig> or  <dig> parallel yet interconnected vessels . in reg <dig> mutants, however, the caudal vein forms fewer branches and develops a large swollen vascular lumen . the reg <dig> mutation is temperature sensitive causing up to 70% penetrance of its embryonic phenotypes at 33°c  and 0%~5% at 20°c . the temperature sensitivity of its regenerating vessel phenotype is described below . taking advantage of the incomplete penetrance of the reg <dig> embryonic phenotype, we initiated a screening to search for chemical suppressors and enhancers of reg <dig> mutation. we tested a small collection of known compounds using reg6-homozygous embryos . of the  <dig> tested chemicals, one showed significant suppression of reg <dig> phenotypes in developing caudal veins at a concentration of  <dig> μm . this chemical, 4- butylisothiourea dihydrochloride , is an inhibitor of hmt, the major enzyme responsible for histamine degradation  <cit> . to test the specificity of skf <dig> on reg <dig> vessel phenotypes and its cytotoxicity to developing embryos, we treated reg <dig> and wild-type embryos with different concentrations of the compound. the results showed that suppression was dose-dependent, and the penetrance of the reg <dig> embryonic phenotype could be reduced to 20% by  <dig> μm skf <dig> . the hmt inhibitor caused no morphological defects or vessel over-branching in wild-type embryos at as high as  <dig> μm .

suppression of the reg <dig> embryonic phenotype by a high level of histamine
as hmt is responsible for methylating histamine thus precipitating its degradation, the above results led us to hypothesize that skf <dig> might cause accumulation of histamine, which in turn would rescue reg <dig> phenotypes. we tested this hypothesis by treating reg <dig> embryos with histamine. the results showed that a high level of histamine indeed was able to rescue the embryonic phenotypes of reg <dig> mutants, although the concentration of histamine needed to produce significant suppression was  <dig> μm . like the hmt inhibitor, a high level of histamine caused no discernible developmental defects in wild-type zebrafish embryos .

suppression of the reg <dig> regenerating vessel phenotype by skf <dig> and histamine
as shown before, the blood vessel phenotype in regenerating reg <dig> fins develops swollen vessel lumina at a high temperature . to further confirm the effect of histamine on reg <dig> vessel branching defects, we treated regenerating vessels of reg <dig> and wild-type adult fish with histamine and skf <dig>  consistent with the results obtained from embryos, the regenerated swollen vessel lumen phenotype in reg <dig> fish was both quantitatively and qualitatively suppressed by  <dig> μm skf <dig>  as treated ones formed fewer and smaller blood blisters than their untreated siblings . we then tested whether histamine can also rescue the reg <dig> phenotype in regenerating vessels. in fact,  <dig> mm histamine did suppress the reg <dig> regenerating vessel phenotype . we noted that while most stocks of reg <dig> formed swollen lumina in  <dig> vessels/fish on average at 33°c , some stocks possibly formed  <dig> swollen vessels/fish . but within the same inbred family, the penetrance was less variable . therefore, we were careful to use fish of the same stock for making comparisons. these results suggested that increasing the histamine level can rescue the blood vessel branching defect of zebrafish reg <dig> mutants.

the above results led us to hypothesize that the expression of hmt might increase in reg <dig> mutants, which is responsible for the histamine deficit. to test this, we analyzed the amount of hmt rna in wild-type and reg <dig> regenerates by quantitative pcr . we found that the amounts of hmt rna were nearly 5- and 3-fold higher in reg <dig>  <dig> and 3-dpa regenerates, respectively, than in wild-type ones .

reversion of reg <dig> dilated vessels by histamine and skf91488
we wondered whether histamine and skf <dig> are able to reduce the severity of the vessel phenotype in reg <dig> mutants even after significant swollen vessels had formed. to test this, we first allowed reg <dig> mutants to regenerate at 33°c for  <dig> days to develop swollen lumina, and then shifted them to either  <dig> μm skf <dig>   <dig> mm histamine, or h2o. we then compared the number of swollen vessels before and then  <dig> h after the shift. in the h2o group, the number of swollen vessels in reg <dig> fish was about the same within the 12-h period: near  <dig> swollen vessels/fish . with skf <dig> treatment, however, the number of swollen vessels was significantly reduced to an average of  <dig> swollen vessels/fish . histamine also reduced the number from  <dig> to fewer than  <dig> . in the distal portions of regenerating fins of reg <dig> adults, the vessel defects usually caused necrosis and degeneration, which were thus greatly reduced by histamine and skf <dig> . we concluded that a high level of histamine can reverse the swollen vessel phenotype of the reg <dig> mutation.

enhancement of the reg <dig> regenerating vessel phenotype by a histamine synthesis blocker
to further verify the role of histamine in promoting blood vessel branching, we next tested whether blocking histamine synthesis could enhance reg <dig> vessel branching defects. as stated before, the reg <dig> mutation is temperature sensitive. at a low temperature , the number of swollen vessels in reg <dig> regenerates was nearly zero . we treated reg <dig> regenerating vessels at this temperature with urocanic acid, one of the inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase which is the key enzyme for histamine synthesis. the results showed that the number of swollen vessels in 3-dpa reg <dig> regenerating fins at 20°c was about  <dig>  ±  <dig> /fin , and this increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> /fin  with  <dig> μm urocanic acid . a similar effect was also observed at  <dig> dpa during plexus formation of regeneration at 20°c . note that fin regeneration was much slower at 20°c than at 33°c, and regeneration at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa at 20°c corresponded to the vessel anastomosis and plexus formation stages of vessel regeneration, respectively, both of which are affected by the reg <dig> mutation  <cit> . urocanic acid at  <dig> μm caused no reg6-like phenotype or toxicity in wild-type adult fish .

histamine synthesis blocker causes blood vessel branching defect in wild-type zebrafish embryos
to address whether histamine also influences blood vessel branching in wild-type fish, we treated the wild-type tgy <dig> developing embryos with urocanic acid. in these experiments, we focused on the effect of urocanic acid on the caudal veins which normally form highly branched vascular plexuses during 30– <dig> hpf of the development . among the several doses and treating conditions that we tried, we found that  <dig> μm of urocanic acid, treated from 6– <dig> hpf, had no effect on the caudal vein development or the survival rate whereas  <dig> μm of urocanic acid could cause slightly increase of less branched caudal veins and more than 50% of lethality . however, shorter treatment from 26– <dig> hpf with  <dig> μm urocanic acid caused lower lethality rate but significantly increase of poorly branched caudal veins . these results demonstrate that blocking histamine synthesis indeed hampers blood vessel branching in wild-type zebrafish embryos.

association between egr- <dig> expression and the reg <dig> vascular phenotype
to test whether vegf is involved in the mechanism for suppressing reg <dig> blood vessel branching defects by histamine, we performed qpcrs to examine the expression levels of known vegfs and their receptors and some known angiogenic factors in wild-type and reg <dig> regenerating fins. we found no correlation between vegf signaling and the reg <dig> phenotype, as the expression levels of zebrafish vegf-a, c, and d, and vegfr <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were approximately the same in both wild-type and reg <dig> fish . interestingly, we found that the level of egr- <dig>  which is known to be involved in angiogenesis  <cit>  was downregulated in reg <dig> fish . whole-mount in situ hybridization also showed a significant decrease in egr- <dig> expression in reg <dig> 3-dpa regenerating fins . more importantly, the expression of egr- <dig> in reg <dig> mutants was found to be elevated by approximately  <dig> -fold after treatment with  <dig> mm histamine or  <dig> μm skf <dig> and downregulated by urocanic acid, compared with water-treated siblings . in contrast, expression levels of vegfs and their receptors did not change or changed by less than 2-fold after treatment with histamine, skf <dig>  or urocanic acid . these results suggest that histamine might promote blood vessel branching by regulating egr- <dig> expression directly or indirectly. note that this correlation was only found in adult fish, not in embryos , suggesting that histamine might influence regenerative and embryonic angiogenesis through different mechanisms.

discussion
zebrafish angiogenesis mutation for drug discovery and chemical genetics
we utilized a zebrafish mutation to demonstrate the power of zebrafish for drug discovery and examining chemical genetics. in particular, when using the embryonic phenotype for initial screening, which only required  <dig>  μg of the test compound , the adult phenotypes, if they existed, allowed us to verify the drug effect with only  <dig> μg of drug for each test . in conjunction with tgy <dig> transgenic fish, the screening could be specifically targeted for angiogenesis-related drugs . in addition, with zebrafish, we were able to perform toxicity tests at the same time at the whole organism level. all these factors make zebrafish a great tool for drug testing and discovery. the reg <dig> mutation is unique in that it is homozygously viable and displays similar blood vessel branching defects during embryogenesis and fin regeneration. more importantly, the reg <dig> mutation has the advantage of temperature sensitivity which allowed us to screen for suppressors and enhancers. since reg <dig> mutants display specific defects in blood vessel branching, it has become a good tool for studying the genetic and pharmacological mechanisms of vessel branching which are largely unknown.

the role of histamine in blood vessel branching in reg <dig> and wild-type zebrafish
our results reveal a role of histamine in promoting vessel branching during angiogenesis using zebrafish reg <dig> mutants. the reg <dig> mutants were found to have specific defects in blood vessel branching during plexus formation  <cit> . when reg <dig> mutants were treated with the hmt inhibitor, skf <dig>  which presumably causes accumulation of histamine, or with a high level of histamine, the blood vessel branching defect of reg <dig> was significantly rescued. in contrast, blocking histamine synthesis enhanced the reg <dig> phenotype. these results were further supported by the finding that hmt expression is elevated in reg <dig> mutants. all these suggest a simple model for the reg <dig> blood vessel branching defect which results from a high level of hmt and concomitant histamine deficit.

the role of histamine in regulating blood vessel branching is also observed in wild-type zebrafish. in figure  <dig>  we showed that blocking histamine synthesis with urocanic acid causes blood vessel branching defect and/or a reg6-like phenotype in the caudal veins of wild-type zebrafish embryos. in this experiment, however, we learned that it really required high concentration and careful selection of time window of urocanic acid treatment in order to see its effect on blood vessel branching. treatment of high concentration of urocanic acid for long period of time, e.g. from 6– <dig> hpf caused high lethality rate in developing embryos suggesting that histamine is important for other developmental processes. furthermore, we noted that urocanic acid did not seem to suppress the branching of intersegmental vessels, suggesting that the influence of histamine on vascular branching morphogenesis is selective or more sensitive for the plexus-forming blood vessels.

possible mechanisms of regulating blood vessel branching by histamine
as vascular branching involves complex intracellular and extracellular changes, including breakdown of the extracellular matrix and intercellular junctions, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and induction of cell proliferation, it is difficult to predict the mechanism through which histamine rescues vessel branching defects in reg <dig> fish. even though our phenotypic characterizations provide clues to the specific endothelial cellular defects underlying reg <dig> vascular defects, including defects in cell extension, cell junction formation, and likely permeability as well, it is still not possible at this moment to define a cellular mechanism for the rescue effect of histamine in reg <dig> fish due to the fact that the genetic identity of reg <dig> has yet to be resolved. we have mapped reg <dig> to the telomere region of lg  <dig>  where sequence information is largely lacking, and thus, it is difficult to obtain an accurate physical map. we are currently verifying a physical map of that region assembled by the zebrafish genome sequencing project at the sanger center with our reg <dig> mapping panels. we will need to build a more-accurate physical map of this region for future mapping and cloning of the reg <dig> gene.

nevertheless, we have obtained more clues to reg6's function from previous and the present studies. our previous study showed that the reg <dig> mutation does not cause over-proliferation of regenerating endothelial cells and that reg <dig> function is specifically required during plexus formation when blood vessel endothelial cells are actively branching  <cit> . in this study, we further showed that the reg <dig> mutation does not affect the migration of regenerating endothelial cells. instead, endothelial cells of reg <dig> mutants seem to be defective in extending cell processes and forming cell junctions among themselves. our results also suggest that reg6's function might be involved in regulating histamine metabolism and egr- <dig> expression. consistent with previous results, we observed no effect of histamine on endothelial cell proliferation or migration in wild-type fish, even though it has been shown that histamine is able to cause endothelial cell proliferation in vitro  <cit> . our studies using the zebrafish reg <dig> mutation provide evidence that histamine likely modulates blood vessel branching at a yet unidentified cellular level other than cell proliferation or migration.

correlation of egr- <dig> and the vessel branching defects of reg6
it is very intriguing that we found a close relationship between the egr- <dig> transcription factor and reg <dig> phenotypes. the level of egr- <dig> was low in reg <dig> mutant fish during regenerative angiogenesis, was elevated by histamine and an hmt inhibitor, and was further reduced upon treatment with a histamine synthesis blocker . although the role of egr- <dig> and its relationship with histamine in vascular branching awaits further studies, we found an interesting feature of egr- <dig> in our studies that seem to echo previous finding. fahmy et al  <cit>  has shown that egr- <dig> is required for angiogenesis and tumor growth through an fgf but not a vegf signaling pathway. our qpcr analyses showed that the transcription levels of vegfs and vegfrs remained the same in wild-type and reg <dig> fish with or without histamine manipulations suggesting that the mechanism of blood vessel branching mediated by histamine that involves egr- <dig> is independent of the vegf signaling. it would be exciting to know whether histamine modulates blood vessel branching directly through egr- <dig> and/or a fgf pathway.

direct and indirect actions of histamine on blood vessel endothelial cells
histamine has been shown to increase vessel permeability by regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as vcam  <cit>  and the composition of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . presumably, these actions together can promote vessel branching. our result that histamine can prevent the formation of swollen vessel lumina suggests its influence on actively branching vascular cells. we also showed that histamine can reverse the swelling of vessels and return them to normal, suggesting a role of histamine during vascular plexus remodeling. one possible explanation for these results is that histamine affects a cellular mechanism that is common to both vascular activities, for example cell adhesion or extracellular matrix remodeling. in fact, the histamine receptor inhibitor, cimitidine, has been shown to downregulate the endothelial expression of e-selectin adhesion molecules and prevent tumor metastasis  <cit> , which raises the possibility that histamine might directly modulate vessel branching on endothelial cells by regulating e-selectin expression. however, the fact that histamine does not change endothelial cell proliferation or cause over-branching or any other morphological changes in wild-type fish suggests that endothelial cells are not the direct target of histamine. thus, it is possible that histamine might both directly and indirectly influence vascular branching.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate the power of using a zebrafish mutation in pharmacogenetic studies. our studies using the zebrafish reg <dig> mutation revealed the role of histamine in regulating blood vessel branching and the potential linkage of angiogenic factor egr- <dig> to this process.
