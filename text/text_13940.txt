BACKGROUND
cystic fibrosis  is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to thickened, viscous mucous obstructing the airways, predisposing patients to lifelong bacterial lung infections. the most prevalent pathogen causing such infections is pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is associated with increased morbidity, a reduction in quality of life and ultimately, mortality in cf patients  <cit> . once established in the cf lung, p. aeruginosa is often impossible to eradicate  <cit> , owing to high levels of antibiotic resistance and rapid adaptation to a hostile and dynamic host environment  <cit> . over the course of chronic cf infections, p. aeruginosa undergoes a series of genetic and phenotypic changes in order to adapt to life within the host  <cit> . these typically include loss of virulence factors such as the quorum-sensing regulated pyocyanin, elastase and protease  <cit> , the siderophore pyoverdine  <cit> , as well as emergence of hypermutators  <cit> , conversion to mucoidity  <cit>  increased antibiotic resistance  <cit>  and the loss of motility  <cit> .

despite adaptation to the lung environment observed in chronic p. aeruginosa cf infections, some highly transmissible strains retain the ability to transmit to new hosts and initiate new infections  <cit> . for instance, the liverpool epidemic strain  is associated with enhanced morbidity  <cit> , transmission among patients  <cit> , transmission to both non-cf parents of a cf patient  <cit> , and a pet cat  <cit> . the les is widespread throughout uk cf clinics  <cit>  and is the most abundant strain of p. aeruginosa in the uk cf population  <cit> . recently the les has been reported in the sputa of cf patients in north america  <cit> . the ability of the les to maintain transmission, when adaptation to the lung environment is likely to lead to loss of many of the virulence-associated traits thought to be essential for establishing infections is paradoxical, and suggests that more in-depth studies are required to gain a better understanding of phenotypic variation in virulence-associated secretions within the lung.

a growing number of recent studies have identified substantial within-patient phenotypic diversity in p. aeruginosa expression of virulence factors, siderophores, quorum sensing, antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, motility and auxotrophy . in the les populations, the phenotypic diversity among isolates within a single cf lung sample is far greater than between samples from the same patient over time, and even between patients  <cit> . moreover, patients infected with the les typically harbour a mixture of op phenotypes and quorum sensing-defective lasr mutants  <cit> . the persistence of op phenotypes, in spite of the apparent cost of virulence-associated secretions in chronic cf infections, suggests that these sub-populations may play an important role in the transmissibility of the les.

here, we examine within-patient phenotypic diversity in virulence-associated secretions for three cf patients chronically infected with the highly transmissible les of p. aeruginosa for at least 2 years. to characterize within-host variation in three virulence-associated secretions: pyoverdine, pyocyanin and lasa protease, we performed quantitative trait assays on  <dig> or  <dig> isolates per patient and the earliest-known les strain lesb <dig>  furthermore, we show that within-host phenotypic variation translates into variation in the virulence of acute infections in an insect host model, indicating that population diversity can act as a reservoir for virulent pathotypes.

RESULTS
pyoverdine
each patient harbored populations that, on average, produced less per capita pyoverdine relative to lesb <dig> . patients cf <dig> and cf <dig> showed similar high within-patient variance in pyoverdine production , driven by the coexistence of isolates that produced pyoverdine at levels at least as high as lesb <dig>  with isolates that produced less than 10% relative to lesb <dig>  in contrast, pyoverdine production in patient cf <dig> was greatly reduced and far less variable among isolates compared to cf <dig> and cf <dig>  with all isolates producing less than 50% of lesb58’s pyoverdine .fig.  <dig>

pyocyanin
patients cf <dig> and cf <dig> harboured p. aeruginosa populations that produced elevated levels of mean per capita pyocyanin relative to lesb <dig> . however, per capita pyocyanin production among isolates displayed high variance within both patients, ranging from  <dig> to 266% lesb <dig> levels in cf <dig>  and from  <dig> to 300% in cf <dig>  in both populations, isolates that produced <20% of the pyocyanin produced by lesb <dig>  coexisted with pyocyanin op’s . by contrast, isolates from patient cf <dig> displayed lower mean per capita pyocyanin relative to lesb <dig> . within-population variation in cf <dig> was much lower than that observed in cf <dig> or cf <dig>  with pyocyanin production ranging from  <dig> to 80% that of lesb <dig> levels.

lasa protease
each patient harbored populations that produced significantly lower mean per capita protease relative to lesb <dig> . patients cf <dig> and cf <dig> showed similar high within-host variation in per capita protease production , while isolates from patient cf <dig> showed much reduced levels of protease relative to lesb <dig>  between just 6–16%. in patients cf <dig> and cf <dig>  therefore, lasa protease underproducers coexisted with isolates producing 80–120% of lesb <dig> levels, whereas isolates from patient cf <dig> were all lasa protease underproducers.

correlations between different secretions
we performed principal component analysis on all  <dig> isolates to investigate associations among production of these secretions. overall, isolates typically either upregulated all three secretions, or produced very little of any . while pc <dig> predicts that all three secretions are positively correlated, pyocyanin and lasa protease show the strongest association. we confirmed this by performing linear mixed effects models , which confirmed that the strongest positive correlation was between pyocyanin and protease production  followed by pyocyanin and pyoverdine  and finally pyoverdine and protease .fig.  <dig> while all three secretions were, overall, positively correlated, we find the strongest relationship between pyocyanin and lasa protease production  . each datapoint represents a single isolate, n = 118




we next performed the same analysis independently for each patient . isolates from cf <dig> and cf <dig> were consistent with findings using the full dataset: all three secretions were positively correlated, with the strongest association between lasa protease and pyocyanin . however isolates from patient cf <dig> showed a negative correlation between pyocyanin and pyoverdine, so that downregulating pyoverdine was associated with elevated production of pyocyanin .

virulence assays
to assess whether within-patient diversity could act as a resevoir for virulent pathotypes, we performed virulence assays using  <dig> isolates from the population with the highest phenotypic diversity, cf <dig>  as well as the ancestral strain lesb <dig>  isolates varied in their ability to form virulent infections in a waxmoth host model, ranging from host death within 1 h of innoculation to completely avirulent infections ; by comparison, lesb <dig> killed their waxmoth hosts within an average of 15 h post infection. rapid mortality of waxmoth hosts was positively associated with pyoverdine production  and, less strongly, with pyocyanin production , but we found no statistically significant association between protease production and mortality rate . note, however, that pyocyanin and protease production were highly positively correlated in this population, as we have shown above. hence, on removing the confounding effect of pyocyanin from the full model, protease became an important predictor of waxmoth mortality .

lineage specific virulence
williams et al.  <cit>  analysed the phylogenetic relationship between the  <dig> p. aeruginosa isolates from patient cf <dig> based on whole genome sequences for each isolate. this population comprises of two les lineages, a and b. lineage a is characterised by a non-synonymous mutation in the lasr gene, and so we hypothesised that the production of pyocyanin and protease , and to a lesser extent, pyoverdine  would show an association with lineage. production of all three secretions was higher for isolates in lineage b compared with lineage a . accordingly, waxmoths infected with isolates from lineage b  were killed  <dig> times faster than those infected with isolates from lineage a .fig.  <dig>

discussion
the secretion of virulence-factors by p. aeruginosa is thought to be associated with the establishment of infection in cf. the current paradigm is that if these acute infections become chronic, virulence-associated secretions become less beneficial or costly, and are lost via the accumulation of mutations, particularly in global regulators   <cit> . by quantifying the production of three virulence-associated secretions  for  <dig> p. aeruginosa isolates from three cf patients, we show that the loss of virulence-associated secretions is not always universal within patients. we report that in two out of three patients, isolates that secreted very little , coexisted with isolates that produced secretions at levels at least as high, or several fold higher , than the earliest-known les strain lesb <dig>  moreover, we show that this diversity has consequences for virulence: overproducing isolates displayed higher virulence in a waxmoth larval host, suggesting that within population diversity acts as a ‘resevoir’ for high-virulence sub-populations even in long-term chronic infections. hence, while the general paradigm is that population-level production of virulence-associated secretions decline during chronic infection  <cit> , this does not imply that the ability to cause virulent infections is completely lost. in light of this, effectively diagnosing p. aeruginosa cf infections strongly depends on in-depth microbiological screening that takes into account within-patient diversity.

our study reveals that overall, within-host p. aeruginosa isolates exhibit reduced population-level production of pyoverdine and lasa protease relative to lesb <dig>  since we sacrifice sampling at the patient level at the expense of more in-depth analysis of within-patient diversity, we cannot make any firm claims about whether this finding is representative of p. aeruginosa chronic infections in general. however, our findings are consistent with previous studies that sample fewer isolates from a larger number of patients, such as andersen et al.  <cit>   and hoffman et al.  <cit>  . our results also reveal differences between populations. notably, while infections within patients cf <dig> and cf <dig> demonstrated high within-population diversity, whereby over- and under-producing isolates coexisted, isolates from patient cf <dig> tended to produce very little, if any, of the three secretions that we quantified. this finding is supported by previous work that investigated the phylogenetic relationship between isolates within these three patients, showing that while cf <dig> and cf <dig> populations consist of two genetically diverged lineages, the cf <dig> population consists of just one  <cit> . our finding that patient cf <dig> harboured less phenotypic diversity than cf <dig> and cf <dig> may be partially explained by duration of infection. at the time of sampling, patient cf <dig> had been infected with p. aeruginosa for the least amount of time , compared with cf <dig>  and cf <dig>   <cit> . however, our finding that cf <dig> and cf <dig> show similar levels of diversity, when cf <dig> and cf <dig> have been infected for more similar periods of time suggests that duration of infection is not the only predictor of phenotypic diversity.

this study, along with several others  <cit>  suggests that op phenotypes are commonly found in combination with underproducers within the cf lung. while the explanation for the maintenance of op phenotypes in chronic infections remains to be elucidated, this study provides a potential explanation: op phenotypes may retain the ability to transmit between patients, and levels of secreted virulence-factor production may therefore represent a trade-off between adaptation to either a chronic or acute infection lifestyle. however, evolution has no foresight and so it would be difficult to see how maintaining virulence in a chronic context would be favoured, even if a new infection could be better initiated in the future. hence, while highly virulent subpopulations may be beneficial for transmission, it is likely that other factors play a role in shaping virulence in chronic infections. one possibility is that secretions that confer a benefit to nearby conspecifics will be lost from a population, because non-producing conspecifics can still access the benefits without paying the cost of making the secretion. hence, non-producing ‘cheats’ invade populations of ‘cooperative’ producers  <cit> . moreover, recent in vitro work has shown that coevolution between p. aeruginosa cooperators and cheats enables them to coexist, because cooperators become more difficult to exploit, and cheats become more efficient exploiters  <cit> . while the exploitation of virulence-associated secretions by non-producers could explain the emergence of non-producing lasr mutants in the context of cf, this has yet to be experimentally investigated.

understanding the bacterial characteristics that contribute most to disease is a major path toward developing novel “disarming” antimicrobials  <cit> . a handful of previous studies have monitored the ability of phenotypically varied les isolates to form acute infections. in a mouse model of acute infections, carter et al.  <cit>  revealed subtle variation in four les subtypes  in their ability to kill their host. les <dig>   was best at forming acute infections in a mouse model whereas all mice infected with the quorum-sensing-negative lasr mutant les <dig> survived the entire duration of the experiment. while this might suggest that quorum-sensing is important for establishing acute infection in mice, all lesb <dig>  infected mice also survived. similar results were observed in fruit flies: les <dig> and les <dig> formed the most and least virulent infections, respectively, out of seven les strains from different sources of infection  <cit> . our study reveals that the production of pyoverdine, pyocyanin and lasa protease are all important predictors of virulence in a waxmoth larva host. while these secretions were highly correlated, pyoverdine emerged as the greatest contributor to virulence. a recent meta-analysis has shown that in lab strains such as pao <dig> and pa <dig>  the effect of pyoverdine, albeit frequently contributing to disease, is relatively minor, and varies considerably across infection models  <cit> . while these strains were initially isolated from clinical settings, they have subsequently undergone evolution in the laboratory environment  <cit> , and hence may differ substantially from the clinical strains used in this study. hence, the role of pyoverdine may be more prominent in studies such as this one that use clinical populations comprising of op strains and lasr mutants. our results suggest that to fully understand the ability of virulence-associated secretions to reduce host health and survival, it is vital to carry out additional studies on diverse clinical isolates. this approach is especially relevant for developing novel therapeutics that curb p. aeruginosa pathogenicity by targeting a specific virulence-associated secretion.

CONCLUSIONS
isolates of a cf epidemic strain of p. aeruginosa have been previously shown to display a) loss of viurlence-encoding genes over the course of infection and b) considerable within-patient phenotypic diversity. we demonstrate that this diversity in virulence-associated secretions among isolates means that op virulent strains can sometimes be present in combination with non-virulent strains. hence, despite the common loss of virulence as p. aeruginosa adapts to the cf lung environment, the persistence of high-virulence subpopulations may allow high rates of transmission among patients to be retained.
