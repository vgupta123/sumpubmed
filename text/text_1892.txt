BACKGROUND
arabidopsis thaliana has emerged as a useful system for genomic studies of plant insect-interactions  <cit> . because of the large amount of genomic information available for arabidopsis, it is possible to perform comparisons of gene expression profiles across many different conditions or treatments including various forms of interactions with herbivores and pathogens  <cit> . with regard to specific pathways involved in plant defence against insects, the arabidopsis genomic resources have much advanced, for example, the discovery of genes and proteins of secondary metabolism   <cit> , as well as genes involved in plant-insect defence signalling  <cit> .

previous large-scale gene expression microarray analyses of arabidopsis-herbivore interactions involved plants affected by pieris rapae , spodoptera littoralis , frankliniella occidentalis , bemisia tabaci , brevicoryne brassicae , and myzus persicae   <cit> . these insects represent leave-chewing larvae  as well as cell-sucking  or phloem sap-feeding  adults with p. rapae and b. brassicae being specialist herbivores adapted to members of the brassicaceae as their hosts. the present study complements previous work with an analysis of arabidopsis rosette leaves fed upon by larvae of a different leave-chewing specialist herbivore, plutella xylostella . dbm larvae feed on several crucifer plants and are a frequent pest of agricultural crops including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and rape  <cit> .

overall, our findings from a fully replicated time-course transcriptome analysis of arabidopsis challenged by dbm larvae identified almost three thousand  differentially expressed genes  and several distinct temporal patterns of changes of transcript abundance with prominent changes of transcripts associated with stress response, secondary metabolism, and signalling. in addition, we provide a first comprehensive meta-analysis of array data of herbivore-induced arabidopsis transcription factors, which identified insect-induced transcription factors that are also affected by other forms of biotic or abiotic stress as well as transcription factors that appear to be more specific to the insect-induced response.

RESULTS
overall changes of the arabidopsis leaf transcriptome in response to dbm
arabidopsis rosette leaves  were challenged with feeding dbm larvae . for microarray gene expression profiling, rosette leaves were harvested after  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h of continuous dbm feeding. for each time point leaves were also harvested from unchallenged control plants. in order to obtain enough plant material for rna isolation  each treatment and time point consisted of four or five plants grown together in one pot and exposed to a group of seven dbm larvae. for each treatment and control and for each time point two independent biological replicate experiments were performed and rna derived from each biological replicate was used for two separate array hybridizations each using reversed fluorescence labels . this experimental design thus resulted in four replicate microarray hybridizations per time point and treatment with two biological and two technical replicates comparing rna derived from treated plants with the corresponding control harvested in parallel.

the microarray used in this study is based on a set of  <dig>  arabidopsis gene specific 70-mer oligonucleotides  <cit> . upon removal of manually flagged spots, background correction, and flooring, on average  <dig>  % of all spots were excluded from further analyses as non-detectible. signal intensities were used for loess normalization thereby generating log2-ratios comparing each treatment with the corresponding control. for each time point, we first used the data from the four replicate arrays to perform a student's t-test and to calculate mean expression ratios for each treatment sample relative to the corresponding control. in order to assess the type i error rate, we calculated q-values estimating the false discovery rate based on the parametric p-values obtained from the t-statistic  <cit> . we then used the four normalized expression ratios from each of five time points  to perform an analysis of variance  and again estimated the false discovery rate based on the distribution of parametric p-values . normalized expression ratios for all probes on the array as well as results for all statistical analysis are provided in additional file  <dig>  as expected, higher p-values from t-statistics are associated with a higher false discovery rate; for example, after  <dig> h of herbivory  <dig>  probes were characterized with p <  <dig> , but have a 11% chance to be falsely discovered , while only  <dig>  probes are characterized with p <  <dig> , and these have only a  <dig> % chance to be falsely discovered . however, a relatively large number of array probes were associated with high p-values , which still contain a substantial number of truly differentially expressed genes , as estimated from the higher frequency of genes in these p-value bins compared to the frequency expected if no genes were differentially expressed . thus, by using a low p-value cut-off , we would reduce the number of falsely discovered genes, but would also miss a substantial number of truly differentially expressed genes. therefore, assuming that high fold change differences is associated with a lower likelihood of being false positives, we initially defined as 'differentially expressed'  those genes for each time point that were associated with a t-test p-value of less than  <dig>   and also displayed a more than two-fold change between treatment and control. using this definition, the number of differentially expressed transcripts at each time point was found to range from  <dig>  after  <dig> h of dbm feeding to  <dig>   after  <dig> h of herbivory, with a total of  <dig>  transcripts that were differentially expressed in at least one time point . among these  <dig>  transcripts,  <dig>  were significantly up-regulated  while  <dig>  were significantly down-regulated  and only  <dig> were up-regulated at one time point and down-regulated at another . relatively few genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> h after the onset of feeding with increasing numbers of differentially expressed genes until  <dig> h after dbm feeding. despite ongoing feeding, fewer genes are differentially expressed at  <dig> h after the onset of feeding. at all time points, much fewer transcripts were down-regulated then up-regulated . in summary, a total of  <dig>  probes representing the arabidopsis leaf transcriptome met our strict definition of differential expression in response to dbm feeding in showing a significant  and more than twofold difference of transcript abundance between treatment and control for at least one time point.

temporal patterns of the arabidopsis leaf transcriptome affected by dbm
to estimate the number of genes that were changing in expression between at least two time points we performed an analysis of variance , and found  <dig>  genes that changed more than twofold with p <  <dig>  . however, of these only  <dig>  were also differentially expressed between treatment and control in at least one time point. these  <dig>  genes, which met our most stringent definition of differential expression in response to dbm feeding over the  <dig> hour time course, were placed into nine expression clusters based on their temporal patterns of expression profiles identified by k-means clustering . while  <dig> genes displayed a rapid transient up-regulation within  <dig> h upon onset of herbivory , a total of  <dig> genes peaked at  <dig> h . another group of differentially expressed genes showed up-regulation of transcript abundance mainly at late time-points , while  <dig> genes were up-regulated early during the treatment and maintained high expression levels relative to control plants .

similarly, many down-regulated genes displayed transient expression profiles , although a majority of down-regulated genes maintained lower expression levels over the time course analyzed . interestingly, a portion of genes placed in the down-regulated clusters displayed reversed expression ratios at different time points, e. g. some genes in cluster h were transiently down-regulated at early time-points but were up-regulated later in the experiment. likewise, many genes in cluster i were transiently up-regulated early in the treatment, but were down-regulated  <dig> h after the onset of dbm feeding. in reverse, many genes in cluster f were up-regulated  <dig> h into the time course, but displayed repressed expression at the  <dig> h time point. this cluster also contains genes that display a biphasic expression pattern, with repressed expression at early  and late  time points.

in summary, it is noteworthy that despite continuous insect feeding over the time period analyzed, a majority  of up-regulated genes displayed a transient pattern of change of transcript abundance.

annotation and expression profiles of dbm induced stress-related genes
annotation against higher level geneontology terms at tair  <cit>  revealed that many of the genes up-regulated by dbm feeding fall into the functional categories 'transport', 'response to abiotic or biotic stimulus ', 'protein metabolism', and 'transcription'. in order to analyze expression profiles of stress-related genes in more detail, we retrieved curator annotated tair gene lists for the categories 'response to pest, pathogen or parasite' or 'response to wounding' as well as for genes associated with children terms of these categories. we further limited these lists to those genes that have been annotated based on experimental evidence resulting in  <dig> stress-related genes after removal of duplicates. of these,  <dig> were represented on the microarray and  <dig>  were differentially expressed in response to dbm feeding. expression data for these genes were used for hierarchical cluster analysis shown with expression maps in figure  <dig> 

most of these dbm-affected stress-related genes were strongly up-regulated within  <dig> to  <dig> h after the onset of dbm feeding , and the majority were associated with wound response. in contrast, only five genes were up-regulated only at the  <dig> h time point, including two pathogenesis-related  genes  that are associated with salicylic acid dependent pathogen defence. these genes are down-regulated early during dbm feeding before being up-regulated at  <dig> h. many of the wound-response genes that are strongly up-regulated by dbm are involved in octadecanoid biosynthesis. all known enzymatic steps of the octadecanoid pathway were represented in the cluster of dbm-induced genes . these include the lipoxygenase lox <dig> , two other putative lipoxygenases , the single copy allene oxid synthase aos , the allene oxide cyclases aoc <dig> , aoc <dig> , and aoc <dig> , the 12-oxophytodienoate reductases opr <dig>  and opr <dig> , and 3-oxo-2-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid coa ligase <dig> opcl <dig>   <cit> . other genes in this group of up-regulated wound-response genes are involved in the shikimate pathway , and tocopherol biosynthesis   <cit> .

we further analyzed expression patterns of genes of secondary metabolite pathways that are known to be affected by herbivory, namely glucosinolate, phenolic and terpenoid metabolism . many transcripts of these pathways were differentially expressed upon dbm feeding. for the glucosinolate pathway, two genes involved in the chain elongation of methionin  were up-regulated, while two other members of the mam gene family  <cit>  were not detectibly differentially expressed. also up-regulated were cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases involved in the biosynthesis of various glucosinolates: cyp79a <dig>  catalyzing the conversion of phenylalanine to the corresponding oxime in benzylglucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> ; cyp79b <dig>  converting tryptophan and tryptophan analogs to the oxime in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> ; cyp79f <dig>  involved in the synthesis of long chain aliphatic glucosinolates  <cit> ; and cyp83b <dig>  catalyzing the oxidation of indole-3-acetyldoxime in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> . cyp79b <dig> is also involved in camalexin and auxin biosynthesis  <cit> . dbm feeding further induced the c-s-lyase  that converts s--l-cysteines to the corresponding thiohydroximic acids  <cit> . while none of the three myrosinase encoding genes present in arabidopsis  <cit>  were differentially expressed at detectable levels, two myrosinase associated proteins  were affected. of these mag <dig> , which has been characterized as a quantitative trait locus  controlling the ratio of nitrile to isothiocyanate production during glucosinolate hydrolysis  <cit> , was suppressed by dbm feeding, while the related gene magl  was induced.

relatively few genes that have been functionally characterized to encode enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway are induced by dbm feeding , but many of the genes of this pathway just failed the call to be significantly differentially expressed at stringent conditions. in contrast, eight genes with similarity to known phenylpropanoid genes but otherwise of unknown function were transcriptionally up-regulated .

related to terpenoid biosynthesis, two differentially expressed genes encoding enzymes of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase  and 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidyltransferase   <cit>  were down-regulated by dbm feeding. in contrast the only gene of the mevalonate pathway that was detected as affected by dbm feeding encodes acetoacetyl-coa thiolase  and was up-regulated. in addition, a farnesyl diphosphate synthase  and three of the more than thirty arabidopsis terpene synthase genes   <cit>  were up-regulated by dbm feeding .

expression profiles of phytohormone related genes affected by dbm feeding
based on the relatively large number of transcripts up-regulated by dbm that are associated with biosynthesis of octadecanoids , we compared these transcripts profiles with those associated with other signalling molecules and phytohormones, namely salicylic acid, ethylene, auxin, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid . for this purpose, we retrieved tair gene lists that had been curator annotated to be either involved in the metabolism of these signalling molecules, to be part of the signal transduction mediated by, or to be responsive to these compounds.

we found that genes associated with the signalling molecules jasmonate, auxin, and cytokinin were significantly over-represented among genes up-regulated by dbm feeding based on a hypergeometric distribution  . for comparison, while 11% of all probes on the microarray that are associated with an agi identifier were differentially expressed upon dbm feeding, 44% of the genes associated with jasmonate biosynthesis, signalling, or response were differentially expressed upon dbm feeding, and all were significantly up-regulated in at least one time point . in contrast, genes associated with the signal compounds salicylic acid and ethylene were not more frequently differentially expressed than expected for any randomly chosen group of genes. in contrast to jasmonate-related transcriptome signatures, many genes related to salicylic acid and ethylene signalling were transiently down-regulated followed by a late induction during dbm feeding .

genes associated with gibberellic acid, brassinosteroids, and abscisic acid were also not over-represented among the differentially expressed genes . however, among those genes that were differentially expressed, most genes associated with abscisic acid were rapidly up-regulated upon herbivory, while genes associated with gibberellic acid were predominantly down-regulated .

in addition to genes associated with jasmonate signalling, genes associated with the hormones auxin and cytokinin were also over-represented in the dbm affected transcriptome . while three cytokinin oxidase family members involved in cytokinin catabolism were up-regulated late in the feeding experiment, several cytokinin response regulators are transiently down-regulated during herbivory . likewise, a large group of auxin-induced genes were transcriptionally down-regulated starting at  <dig> h after the onset of herbivory feeding . however, a smaller group of genes in the same group displayed a reverse expression pattern, as did some genes involved in auxin metabolism and the auxin-response transcription factor monopterous   <cit> . overall, our results highlight the importance of jasmonate in herbivore induced signalling, and may also suggest roles for cytokinin and auxin as well.

expression profiles of genes associated with signal transduction
to gain insights into possible signalling processes elicited by dbm feeding, we analyzed expression profiles of genes known or predicted to be involved with signal transduction such as protein kinases, transcription factors, and genes involved in the 26s proteasome pathway . for these genes we retrieved information for complete gene families from plantsp , attfdb , and plantsubq .

of the  <dig> protein kinases present on the microarray,  <dig> were differentially expressed,  <dig> were up-regulated, while  <dig> were down-regulated . fourteen kinases were differentially expressed in at least two time points . most genes in this group code for receptor-like kinases such as leucin rich repeat  and peptido-glucan  binding domain containing kinases. in addition, two mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinases  were transcriptionally up-regulated: anp <dig>  is a mapkkk protein related to nicotiana protein kinase  <dig>  which may negatively regulate stress responses  <cit> ; and raf <dig>  contains an ankyrin domain but has not been further characterized. a calcium-dependent protein kinase, at2g <dig>  which is a member of a plant specific protein kinase family that specifically interacts with the calcium sensor protein calcineurinb-like  <cit> , was also up-regulated by dbm feeding. finally, two agc kinases , which belong to a family of effectors of the intracellular second messengers camp, cgmp, phospholipids, and ca2+  <cit> , were up-regulated upon herbivory.

among the  <dig>  transcription factors represented on the array,  <dig> were differentially expressed in at least one time point, with  <dig> being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated, while two displayed a mixed expression . thirty five transcription factors were differentially expressed in at least two time points, ten of which were down-regulated and  <dig> were up-regulated . among the ten down-regulated transcription factors, basic helix loop helix  and homeodomaine binding  proteins of the hd-zip ii class form the dominant group. transcription factors that were up-regulated by dbm feeding predominantly belong to ap2-erebp, myb, and nac type factors . notably, three myb and three ap2-erebp factors were up-regulated rapidly within  <dig> h after the onset of dbm feeding and stayed up-regulated. expression of all five ap-erebp transcription factors found to be dbm-induced by microarray analysis also showed highly similar expression profiles when validated by qrt-pcr . although several ap2-erebp type transcription factors have been associated with regulating stress responses, to date none of the transcription factors identified here has been characterized in detail. among the dbm-induced myb transcription factors, only myb34/atr <dig> has previously been characterized as a positive regulator of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis  <cit> , which is consistent with results that most of its target genes were up-regulated by dbm feeding .

targeted protein degradation via the ubiquitin/26s-proteasome pathway is another important regulatory process  <cit> . among the  <dig>  arabidopsis genes annotated to be involved in this pathway,  <dig>  are present on the array and  <dig> were differentially expressed upon dbm feeding . among these are a  <dig> putative e3-ubiquitin-protein-ligases that were affected by dbm, in addition to five differentially expressed 26s-proteasome components, a single ubiquitin-like gene and a e2-ubiquitin activating enzyme  . figure  <dig> shows the expression profile of ten different e3-ubiquitin-protein-ligases that were differentially expressed in at least two time points. in summary, we identified a large number of signal transduction components affected by dbm feeding. in particular, members of the ap2-erebp family of transcription factors stand out as being rapidly induced by herbivory suggesting roles for this family in dbm induced signal transduction networks.

discussion
infestation by feeding dbm larvae induces substantial overall changes in the arabidopsis leaf transcriptome, with  <dig>  array elements representing  <dig>  annotated genes that were significantly induced and  <dig>  elements representing  <dig> annotated genes that were repressed significantly. despite continuous feeding the majority of differentially expressed genes displayed a transient expression profile with a maximum transcript abundance level at  <dig> h after onset of feeding and were down to their initial transcript level after  <dig> h . it is not known what proportion of the induced changes of the transcriptome result in any downstream changes; and it is possible that some defence responses only require a transient burst at the level of the transcriptome to become effective and a large part of the initial response could return to the pre-attack steady-state level of gene expression. repressor proteins, such as the recently discovered jaz proteins involved in the mediation of jasmomate signalling  <cit> , may be involved in shaping such rapid and transient responses.

although only a few plant species have been studied for the impact of insect attack on large-scale transcriptome changes, their diversity ranges from relatively short-lived herbaceous plants to long-lived trees, including angiosperms and gymnosperms. results obtained with these systems support the general notion that insect feeding induces massive changes of the host plant transcriptome  <cit> . a few general patterns have emerged from these studies suggesting that herbivory can results in down-regulation of primary metabolic processes while at the same time activating defence related processes including secondary defence metabolism. these findings are well supported by our analysis of the arabidopsis transcriptome affected by dbm feeding. in addition, the massive reprogramming of primary and secondary metabolic processes as part of the insect-induced defence response involves rapid changes in signalling and other regulatory processes. the present study establishes a signature of dbm-induced changes of the signalling transcriptome of arabidopsis leaves.

in order to more broadly identify common patterns of the transcriptome response of arabidopsis to different herbivores, we compared data obtained in this study with other large scale expression analyses that used different array platforms to study the transcriptome responses induced by p. rapae  <cit> , s. littoralis  <cit> , f. occidentalis  <cit> , b. tabaci  <cit> , m. persica  <cit> , and b. brassicae  <cit>  . despite the large differences in the biological materials and the different array platforms used , which precludes complete comparisons, a substantial overlap in the groups of up- or down-regulated genes was apparent . the highest relative degree of overlap of the dbm-affected transcriptome was found with the effect of s. littoralis, as dbm a leaf chewing caterpillar, with 47%  of differentially expressed genes common on both platforms being induced by both s. littoralis and dbm. similarly, between 32% and 40%  of those genes that are in common to the respective platforms used in studies with p. rapae and in our analysis with dbm agreed in their general induction . both p. rapae and dbm are leaf chewing caterpillar specialized to the brassicacea. overall lower degrees of relative overlap in the group of induced genes were found when the response induced by dbm was compared with the responses induced by cell-sucking thrips, f. occidentalis, or the phloem sap-feeding herbivores m. persicae, b. tabaci, and b. brassica with 11% to 31% of induced genes found in common. in this comparison, the highest relative degree of overlap was found with the aphid b. brassica, which is as dbm a specialist herbivore. together these comparisons suggest that herbivores with a similar mode of feeding may induce a more similar transcriptome response in the host.

surprisingly, in the meta-analysis of all microarray data represented in this comparative arabidopsis-herbivory transcriptome study , we found only one gene being up-regulated in nine of the ten experiments compared: the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase cyp79b <dig>  which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime, the precursor of indole glucosinolates, camalexin, and also auxin  <cit> . six additional genes were found up-regulated in eight of the ten experiments, including three other genes related to tryptophan metabolism and glucosinolate biosynthesis as well as the jasmonate inducible tyrosine aminotransferase tat, which is involved in tocopherol biosynthesis  <cit> . an additional  <dig> genes were found induced in at least six of the experiments compared , and almost half of these  were found in the geneontology category 'response to stress' including genes encoding enzymes of the shikimate pathway , phenylpropanoid metabolism, glucosinolate bioynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and chlorophyll degradation . genes encoding functions in the octadecanoid pathway were also found induced in most of the individual datasets of this comparative arabidopsis-herbivory transcriptome meta-analysis. the role of octadecanoids in mediating herbivore-induced responses is well established, and it has been estimated that up to 80% of all herbivore-induced arabidopsis genes are octadecanoid regulated  <cit> .

our analysis of the dbm-induced response in arabidopsis agrees with the central role of ocatdecanoids since jasmonate related genes were significantly over-represented in the set of dbm-induced genes. while auxin and cytokinin related genes also appear to be involved in different aspects of the responses to dbm, in contrast to the jasmonate related genes, a substantial portion of the cytokinin and auxin related genes were down-regulated . cytokinin and auxin are important in the control of plant morphogenesis and frequently act antagonistically  <cit> . cytokinin is known to promote cell division, delays leaf senescence and may have a role in reallocation of resources from source to sink tissues  <cit> . in previous studies, auxin levels were found to be decreased in tobacco and maize after wounding or upon herbivore infestation  <cit> , and external application of auxin decreased wound responses including production of jasmonate  <cit>  and proteinase inhibitor gene expression  <cit> . auxin related genes were also found to be down-regulated in wounded arabidopsis plants  <cit> . thus, auxin- and jasmonate-dependent processes may be subject to opposite regulation in the plant response to wounding or herbivory. in support of this notion, we found that many of the stress-related signal transduction components induced upon dbm herbivory are also induced by methyl jasmonate, but are repressed by auxin .

in the present study we identified a large number of transcripts that are affected by dbm feeding and are broadly associated with signal transduction components . transcriptome patterns associated with signalling in insect attack have not been well established. in other plant species this is largely due to the smaller array platforms commonly available that may not include many transcription factors or other signalling features. also, lack of relevant reference datasets such as those obtained from array analyses of other stress treatments in the same plant species make meta-analyses of signalling transcriptomes currently a difficult task for most plant species, except for arabidopsis. we established a first meta-analysis of dbm-induced regulatory proteins  to integrate results obtained in the present microarray analysis of dbm-induced arabidopsis leaves with previously published arabidopsis microarray data from various treatments related to biotic and abiotic stress response . specifically, we selected microarray data from a total of  <dig> arabidopsis samples treated with a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses, phytohormones and biological elicitors, or other chemicals . the data analyzed in this comparison are based on the affymetrix ath <dig> platform, were retrieved from the 'genevestigator' database  <cit> , and were processed as described in additional file  <dig>  based on this meta-analysis, the dbm-affected transcription factors and other signalling components identified in our experiments can be divided into two large classes:  those that are responsive to a wide range of different forms of biotic and abiotic stress ; and  those that are not effected by most other treatments of this comparison .

signalling components in group-i and group-iii thus constitute candidates involved generally in stress perception and transduction. group-i and group-iii transcription factors include all dbm-affected ap2-erebp genes, the bhlh pif <dig>  wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  the c2h <dig> at5g <dig>  myb <dig>  and all dbm-effected nac type transcription factors. most of these genes were also found to be induced by other herbivores, although with notable exceptions . for example, the ap2-erebp at2g <dig> is rapidly and strongly induced by dbm feeding, but appears unaffected by the other herbivore treatments, while treatments with some bacterial or fungal pathogens, drought, and abscisic acid lead to transiently induced expression .

signalling components in group-ii appear to be specific to dbm treatment, as they were not found induced in most other stress treatment . however, lack of induction in other treatments needs to be interpreted cautiously, since different expression profiling platforms were used. the transcription factors jag  and bhlh <dig> , which are members of group ii, were also found induced upon herbivory with p. rapae and m. persicae, respectively  but were found induced in only three and five, respectively, of the other  <dig> stress treatments . jag had previously been shown to be necessary for the development and shaping of lateral organs such as leaves  <cit> . taken together, we identified a large set of signal transduction components that likely orchestrate a rapid and general response to a wide range of external stresses, but also a large set of signaling components that may mediate responses more specific to plant-herbivore responses.

very few of the protein kinases, transcription factors and ubiquitin ligases that are affected by dbm feeding  have well characterized functions. a notable exception is the transcription factor myb34/atr <dig> , which encodes a positive regulator of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis. atr <dig> has previously been implied in insect-induced signalling  <cit>  and is induced in particular late into the dbm feeding experiment. atr <dig> was also found induced upon herbivory by p. rapae  <cit> , but appears repressed upon treatment with f. occidentalis and m. persicae  <cit>  . three additional transcription factors, the two ap2-erebp rap <dig>   and at2g <dig> as well as myb <dig> , were previously identified as induced by wounding, methyl jasmonate, various pathogens, and several forms of abiotic stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the arabidopsis transcriptome changes substantially in response to leaf feeding dbm larvae. major dbm induced changes are involved in specialized  defence metabolism and in signalling. the dbm induced response shows considerable overlap with the response induced by other insect herbivores. a first large-scale meta-analysis of arabidopsis microarray data obtained for a large number of biotic and abiotic interactions revealed groups of transcription factors and other signalling components that are similarly affected by multiple forms of biotic or abiotic stress including dbm feeding or, alternatively, appear more specifically responsive to dbm herbivory.
