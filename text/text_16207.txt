BACKGROUND
legionella pneumophila is one of  <dig> described species belonging to the genus legionella of the family legionellaceae
 <cit> . these gram-negative bacteria are ubiquitous inhabitants of natural and manmade aquatic environments where they survive parasitically in protozoa like amoeba
 <cit>  and in community structures such as biofilms
 <cit> . additionally, legionella can infiltrate the human lung via inhaled aerosols
 <cit>  and subsequently infect alveolar macrophages
 <cit>  which frequently cause a potential fatal pneumonia termed legionnaires’ disease 
 <cit> . l. pneumophila strains belonging to the serogroup  <dig>  were predominantly reported in ld cases, especially in community acquired and travel-associated cases
 <cit> .

lipopolysaccharide  is the major immuno-dominant antigen of all legionella species including l. pneumophila <cit> . it is the main component recognized by patient’s sera and by diagnostic assays in urinary antigen detection
 <cit> . the lps molecule possesses a high degree of diversity and thereby provides the basis for the classification of l. pneumophila into serogroups and subgroups by monoclonal antibodies 
 <cit> . sg <dig> strains are subdivided into nine mab-subgroups using the dresden monoclonal antibody panel 
 <cit> .

a variable results with different strains.

the structural characterization of lps of l. pneumophila identified several specific chemical attributes which differs it from the lps molecules of other gram-negative bacteriareviewd in
 <cit> . particularly the o-antigen homopolymer structure consists of an unusual residue, 5-acetamidino-7-acetamido-8-o-acetyl- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  9-tetradesoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid  and its derivates
 <cit> .

a central step in understanding the correlation of the lps structure and pathogenesis of l. pneumophila was the description of the genetic background of lps molecules by lüneberg and colleagues
 <cit> . more precisely, a genetic locus composed of at least  <dig> open reading frames  is essential in lps core oligosaccharide biosynthesis and lps o-chain biosynthesis. the genes of this 31-36 kb cluster have characteristic functions required for the synthesis, transport, translocation and modification of lps components. the lag- <dig> gene of this biosynthesis locus encodes for an o-acetyltransferase which is responsible for the 8-o-acetylation of legionaminic acid
 <cit> . strains carrying a functional lag- <dig> synthesize an lps epitope that reacts with the mab 3/ <dig>  of the dresden monoclonal antibody panel. this epitope is assumed to contribute to an increased virulence
 <cit>  since mab 3/1+ strains represent the most prominent subgroup of clinical legionella isolates. in contrast, strains lacking lag- <dig> carry mainly deacetylated lps molecules. these mab 3/1- strains comprise only a small number of clinically identified l. pneumophila strains in immunocompetent patients
 <cit> .

besides the mab 3/ <dig> specific o-acetylation of the legionaminic acid epitope, to date it remains elusive how strain specific mab-reactivities can be explained. increased understanding of the genetic background and structural lps properties of the different sg <dig> strains could help to comprehend subgroup distributions among clinical and environmental isolates
 <cit>  and would deliver more insight in the role of lps in the l. pneumophila life cycle.

to achieve this goal, we analyzed the lps-biosynthesis loci of at least one member of each mab-subgroup  of the l. pneumophila sg <dig>  in this study we focused on the genetically composition of the loci and putative genotype-phenotype correlations according to the dresden panel of mabs.

RESULTS
two regions within the lps-biosynthesis locus
to gain insight into the genetic composition and arrangement of the lps biosynthesis locus we analyzed the loci of 14 l. pneumophila sg <dig> strains. the strains represent members of all mab–subgroups that can be distinguished by the dresden monoclonal antibody panel  besides the extremely rare mab-subgroup oxford. the lps biosynthesis loci of five strains were newly sequenced for this study. these were: camperdown  <dig> and heysham  <dig> of the rarely found subgroups of the same name
 <cit>  and the strains uppsala  <dig>  görlitz  <dig> and l10/ <dig>  eight lps biosynthesis loci were obtained from complete genomes that have been published previously. furthermore, for strain rc <dig>  the biosynthesis locus was available as well .

* only lps biosynthesis locus sequenced.

the lps-biosynthesis locus of each of the analyzed l. pneumophila sg <dig> strains contained at least  <dig> orfs and ranged in size from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp  with an average locus size of  <dig>  bp respectively. the average orf size within the locus was approximately 1 kb. the complete lps-biosynthesis locus had a slightly lower % gc content  than the adjacent regions  and the total genome , respectively.

structural and comparative analysis of the loci confirmed a highly conserved 15 kb region from weca  to lpg <dig>  according to the philadelphia genome as shown previously
 <cit> . additionally, all orfs within this region were consistently orientated into the same direction .
 <cit> . a: shows the sg1-specific 18 kb region  and b: shows the 15 kb region . the direction of transcription is indicated by arrowheads. the filled black arrows indicate transposases/phage-related proteins. grey shades and hatched patters serve to distinguish orfs. asterisk in uppsala  <dig>  philadelphia  <dig> and paris represents a partial orf  <dig> duplication  as described by
 <cit> . underlined orfs 7– <dig> in strain 130b represent an inversion. görlitz  <dig> carries a truncated lag- <dig> marked with †.

a second region within the locus of 18 kb in size is spanning from lpg <dig>  to lpg <dig> . here, the structural composition and the orientation of orfs as well as the total amount of putative orfs was less conserved. interestingly, many transposases and phage related genes were present in  <dig> strains .

the heterogeneous nature of the 18 kb region and the extremely high conserved 15 kb region found in our study are largely in agreement with earlier results. these proposed to separate the locus into a sg <dig> specific and a l. pneumophila specific region
 <cit> . microarray analysis of sg <dig> and non-sg <dig> strains have identified a 13 kb region  which is present in all l. pneumophila strains and a 20 kb region  generally found in all sg <dig> strains
 <cit> . the two regions were defined based on the lps-biosynthesis loci of the sg <dig> strain paris
 <cit> .

to determine the putative breakpoint between both regions is difficult. however, based on our analysis of the structural composition we would rather separate the lps biosynthesis locus between lpg <dig>  and weca . this is in agreement with recent data, since the genes weca  and gale  were demonstrated to be present in non-sg <dig> strains with lower amino acid similarities when compared to sg <dig> strains 
 <cit> .

the initially mentioned orf  <dig> is located next to the breakpoint region. in total, four different types of orfs were found in the analyzed region of sg <dig> strains here named orf 13-a, -b, -c and –a. in each of the strains lens, 130b, hl  <dig> and görlitz  <dig> two orfs were found. these strains carried a putative conserved protein of unknown function . a transposase-disrupted orf 13-a was present in strain 130b . additionally, the strains carried an orf which shared features of the radical s-adenosylmethionine  superfamily  named orf 13-c . interestingly, all these strains lacked the orf  <dig>  however, even though the strain lorraine lacked orf  <dig> as well, it carried only a single orf 13-a variant.

a distinct orf of unknown function with amino acid similarity to orf 13-a of only 38%, here named orf 13-a, was present in the remaining strains with the exceptions of a truncated form in strains rc <dig>  philadelphia  <dig> and paris. philadelphia  <dig> and paris shared high similarities with orf 13-a but a deletion led to a frame shift resulting into three smaller fragments  .

a conserved region found in all serogroup  <dig> strains
within the conserved region several genes were found which are proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the highly acetylated core region which is composed of mannose, n-acetyl-glucosamine , n-acetyl-quinovosamine  and rhamnose residues
 <cit> . a vast number of orfs, more specifically orf  <dig> through  <dig> and  <dig>  were recently reported to facilitate the biosynthesis of the repetitive legionaminic acid residues of the o-antigen
 <cit> . the pyrodoxal-phosphate dependent aminotransferase , the acetyltransferase neud  and a dehydratase  located outside of the locus are likely to synthesize the precursor molecule of legionaminic acid, udp-n,n’-diacetylbacillosamine 
 <cit> . contradictory to our findings, functions of the neud products are described highlighting that the acetyltransferase is involved in lag-1-independent o-acetylation of few legionaminic acid residues close to the lps-core of l. pneumophila <cit> . furthermore, the adjacent genes encoding for neuc , neub  and neua  were recently identified to be involved in the subsequent biosynthetic processes converting udp-bac2ac4ac into cmp- <dig> -diacetamido- <dig> , <dig> -tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-talo-nonulosonic acid 
 <cit> . moreover, the orf  <dig> is homologous to the ptmg gene of campylobacter jejuni  which converts the cmp-leg5ac7ac residue to cmp-5-acetamidino-7-acetamido- <dig> , <dig> -tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-talo-nonulosonic acid 
 <cit> , the dominant residue of the o-antigen of non-sg <dig> strains of l. pneumophila <cit> . a functional correlation of the orfs of this region is supported by recent transcriptomic data of strain paris in which the orfs 21- <dig> and 28- <dig> were transcribed as operons
 <cit> . since all analyzed sg <dig> strains and a broad number of non-sg <dig> strains carry orf 28
 <cit>  it can be assumed that cmp-leg5am7ac is a common residue of the l. pneumophila lps molecule which might subsequently become modified in a mab-subgroup or even strain specific manner.

three clusters of the o-acetyltransferase lag-1
a well examined phenotype variation is linked to the presence and absence of the lag- <dig> gene. lag- <dig> encodes for an o-acetyltransferase that conferred reactivity with mab 3/ <dig> and is exclusively found in sg <dig> strains. our results revealed three clusters of the lag- <dig> genes, although without any detectable relation to the mab-subgroup switch which supports recent findings
 <cit>  . lag- <dig> was previously reported to be involved in mab-subgroup switches of different strains. however, this was generally due to gene deletion or loss-of-function mutations of lag- <dig> <cit> . complete and functional lag- <dig> genes were present in all mab 3/1+ strains and were absent in all mab 3/1- strains. besides that, the philadelphia subgroup strains  as well as the knoxville-subgroup strain uppsala  <dig> carried a transposase and a partial duplication of orf  <dig> adjacent to lag- <dig>  bernander et al. reported the region from orf  <dig> to orf  <dig> as unstable
 <cit> . looping out of the intermediate located lag- <dig> gene is assumed to be a potential consequence. under in vitro conditions the deletion of the lag- <dig> gene occurred at with frequency of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> . detailed analysis of the region from orf  <dig> to orf  <dig> including lag- <dig> of these strains revealed remarkably high similarities of uppsala  <dig> to the philadelphia-subgroup strains philadelphia  <dig> and paris  whereas the remaining knoxville-subgroup strains clustered in a different group . the high similarity of this 4 kb region between strain uppsala  <dig> and the strains paris and philadelphia  <dig> may indicate horizontal gene transfer of this region. however, this had no impact on the specific mab reactivity for all other analyzed knoxville-subgroup strains. horizontal gene transfer between strain paris and philadelphia  <dig> was recently reported for a large genome fragment which also harbored the lps biosynthesis locus
 <cit> . these observations are confirmed by our results since the lps biosynthesis loci of both strains are almost identical in composition, arrangement and amino acid similarity . a truncated lag- <dig> gene was found in the strain görlitz  <dig>  as recently reported
 <cit> . the whole gene is present but carries a mutated start codon. since görlitz  <dig> showed no reactivity with mab 3/ <dig> it was assumed that the mutation significantly impairs the production of a functional o-acetyltransferase. phylogenetic analysis showed  <dig> % amino acid similarity of görlitz  <dig> to corby , 130b and lens  .

abc-transporter genes wzt and wzm as sg1-specfic marker region
noticeable conserved genes within the heterogenic region were wzt  and wzm  which are almost identical among all analyzed sg <dig> strains . wzm encodes for a protein containing a transmembrane domain while wzt encodes for a nucleotide binding domain of an abc transporter system which mediates the o-antigen translocation across the inner membrane
 <cit> . recently, both genes were evaluated as marker genes for pcr based discrimination between l. pneumophila sg <dig> and non-sg <dig> strains
 <cit> . the abc transporter-dependent o-antigen pathway interacts with weca , an udp-glcnac-1-transferase which initiates o-chain biosynthesis at the cytoplasmic site of the inner membrane
 <cit> . the low amino acid similarity of weca between sg <dig> and non-sg <dig> that was described recently combined with the absence of wzm and wzt in non-sg <dig> genomes
 <cit>  indicate a different o-chain biosynthesis mechanism for non-sg <dig> strains than found in sg <dig> strains.

orf  <dig> through  <dig> involved in o-antigen modification
the most variable region within the sg1-specific region in terms of low similarities on the amino acid level and the diverse arrangement of single orfs was found from orf  <dig> to orf  <dig>  the strains of mab-subgroup benidorm 130b and lens were almost identical regarding the amino acid similarities of the single orfs within the sg1-specific region. interestingly, strain 130b carried a large inverted fragment containing orf  <dig> to orf  <dig> . this region was surrounded by transposases suggesting their potential contribution to the inversion. since the strain 130b showed no altered reactivity pattern using the dresden panel compared to other benidorm strains it could be stated that the inversion had no detectable effect on the lps phenotype detected by monoclonal antibodies.

the adjacent orf  <dig> showed a high degree of variability between l. pneumophila sg <dig> strains represented by two clusters of low amino acid similarity  . interestingly, the two analyzed strains of the mab-subgroup benidorm, 130b and lens, cluster into two distinct groups. this either indicates that the product of orf  <dig> has probably no effect on the lps structure of strains of the same monoclonal subgroup or that it has the same function despite low similarity.

however, orf  <dig> products might be involved in the establishment of a mab-subgroup discriminating epitope. more precisely, only the mab-subgroups heysham and knoxville react with mab  <dig>  this indicates a similar epitope which in turn could possibly be traced back to specific orfs within the sg1-specific region. however, strains of both mab-subgroups were highly homologous regarding the whole lps-biosynthesis with the exception of lag- <dig> which is present in knoxville strains. . in addition, the strain camperdown  <dig>  not reacting with mab  <dig>  carried a very similar lps-biosynthesis locus as heysham  <dig> and the knoxville strains. however, it is the single orf  <dig> in which camperdown  <dig> clusters differently to heysham  <dig>  it can be assumed that the combination of orf  <dig> to  <dig> which is exclusively found in knoxville and heysham strains leads to reactivity with mab  <dig>  another orf  <dig> as found in the genetically very similar strain camperdown  <dig> could alter the lps epitope and is thereby not recognized by mab  <dig>  furthermore, the mab  <dig> epitope was not influenced by o-acetylation of the legionaminic acid residue since the knoxville strains were mab 3/1+ and carried the lag- <dig> gene whereas the strain heysham  <dig> is negative for both markers.

modification of legionaminic acid in transposon mutants
two additional orfs, orf  <dig> and orf  <dig>  within in the highly variable region from orf  <dig> to orf  <dig> are most likely involved in o-antigen modification. the genetic nature of the orf  <dig> products displayed two different clusters which was comparable to the clustering of orf  <dig>  both clusters share poor amino acid similarities of 31%  and  <dig> %  . these differences in amino acid similarity were also reflected by the orf orientation. both orfs were orientated into opposite directions in strains of the mab-subgroups knoxville, camperdown and heysham which form a separate cluster in both orfs . for the remaining mab-subgroups  the orfs are oriented into identical directions. in silico analysis of these loci predicted a five-gene operon from orf  <dig> to orf  <dig> suggesting a coupled functional entity
 <cit> . these strains were also grouped into a single cluster. however, recent transcriptomic data obtained from strain paris revealed a four-gene operon which lacks orf 8
 <cit> . for all strains regardless of the distance in the phylogenetic tree blastp predicted a methyltransferase function for orf 8
 <cit>  and a siliac acid synthetase function  for orf 9
 <cit> .

it is reported that the putative methyltransferase encoded by orf  <dig> is responsible for n-methylation of the 5-acetimydyol amino group of the legionaminic acid
 <cit> . this is supported by studies on the legionaminic acid pathway of campylobacter. the ptmh gene  of c. jejuni is a homologue of orf  <dig> of the knoxville, camperdown and heysham subgroup cluster 
 <cit> . the ptmh product catalyzes the modification of cmp-leg5am7ac to the n-methylated residue cmp-5-acetimidoyl  amino-7-acetamido- <dig> , <dig> -tetradeoxynon-2-ulosonic acid , the main residue of the sg <dig> o-antigen. disruption of orf  <dig> in the bellingham-subgroup strain görlitz  <dig> led to loss-of-reactivity with the bellingham-subgroup specific mab 10/ <dig> and mab 20/ <dig> and resulted in a mab-subgroup switch from subgroup bellingham to camperdown. in similar mutants of the mab 3/1+ strain 130b the reactivity with mab 20/ <dig> was also lost when orf  <dig> or orf  <dig> was disrupted leading to a switch from mab-subgroup benidorm to allentown. the wild type strains 130b and these mutants did not react with mab10/ <dig>  this supported the assumption that the mab 3/1-specific epitope generated by the o-acetyltransferase lag- <dig> masks the n-methyl group and hinders binding of mab 10/6
 <cit> . this is in agreement with earlier observations which reported a correlation between orf  <dig> and n-methylated legionaminic acid residues for the mab 3/1- strain rc1
 <cit> . however, the fact that mutants of both strains, 130b and görlitz  <dig>  lost the reactivity with mab 20/ <dig>  indicated that orf  <dig> and/or orf  <dig> are also involved in the generation or modification of another epitope which is not blocked by the o-acetyl group.

to find putative orf candidates, next to orf  <dig>  that are responsible for synthesis or modification of the common epitope bound by mab 20/ <dig>  we looked for similar but unique orfs within the sg1-specific region of bellingham- and benidorm-subgroup strains. phylogenetic analyses identified orf  <dig> as a putative subgroup discriminating gene since the mab-subgroups benidorm and bellingham clustered in specific separate group when compared to the other mab-subgroups . the presence of two different orf  <dig> variants is in agreement with recent results obtained by subgroup specific pcr amplification
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
characterization of the lps-biosynthesis loci of l. pneumophila sg <dig> strains revealed two mayor regions: a sg1-specific region of 18 kb and a conserved 15 kb region containing genes found in sg <dig> and non-sg <dig> strains. the conserved region carries genes involved in outer core and o-chain biosynthesis of lps molecules.

the variable and heterogeneous sg1-specific region raised questions concerning the genetic basis for subgroup specific mab-reactivity. switches from one monoclonal subtype to another in transposon induced mutants gave a first indication for the function of different gene products. the most variable region from orf  <dig> to orf  <dig> is likely involved in o-antigen modifications and could deliver more insight in the strain specific lps structures and more important, in strain specific virulence. the orfs within this region could act in a pathway-like manner explaining the broad variability of the lps molecule among the sg <dig> strains. furthermore, it is also not excluded that each orf of this region has an own function in the late modification of legionaminic acid derivates which could be regulated in a life cycle or growth phase-depended way. further studies using specific mutation in these orfs, mrna assays and chemical analysis are required in order to elucidate the role of different genes in the synthesis of the subgroup specific structures in different strains.
