BACKGROUND
the essential trace elemental selenium  is the 34th element on the periodic table and plays a fundamental role in human health  <cit> . se is involved in several major metabolic pathways, such as thyroid hormone metabolism, antioxidant defense systems and immune function  <cit> . in humans, selenium has navigated a narrow range from dietary deficiency  to toxic levels   <cit> . selenium toxicity in humans has been reported in the chinese provinces hubei and shaanxi and in indian punjab, where se levels in locally produced foods were found to be very high   <cit> . the variation of se status in humans both related to either se excess or deficiency largely depends on the diet consisting of various crops, vegetables, fruits and meat  <cit> . therefore, it is essential to understand the factors controlling the dynamic distribution of se in the environment. microorganisms are involved in the transformation of selenium from one oxidation state to another  <cit> - <cit> . a few studies reported that bacteria oxidized selenium to se and se in soils  <cit> , <cit> . the formation of volatile methylated selenium species was also studied in several bacteria  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in addition, numerous bacteria were shown to reduce se/se to elemental se, visible as red-colored nano-selenium  <cit> - <cit> .

se-reducing bacteria generate red-colored elemental selenium nanoparticles  either under aerobic or under anaerobic conditions. anaerobic se-reducing bacteria encompass thauera selenatis <cit> , aeromonas salmonicida <cit>  and purple non-sulfur bacteria  <cit> . aerobic bacteria involved in se reduction include diverse species such as rhizobium sp. b <dig>  <cit> , stenotrophomonas maltophilia seite <dig>  <cit> , pseudomonas sp. ca <dig>  <cit> , duganella sp. and agrobacterium sp.  <cit> . however, the exact mechanism of selenium metabolism and reduction is still far from being elucidated.

some studies implied that diverse enzymes are involved in dissimilatory reduction based on the appearance of extracellular and/or intracellular senps in different microbes  <cit> , <cit> . three different pathways were suggested as to the molecular mechanisms underlying se reduction so far. the periplasmic nitrite reductase was responsible for se reduction in t. selenatis <cit>  and rhizobium selenitireducens <cit> . another mechanism linking redox precipitation of both elemental sulfur and elemental selenium was observed outside sulfate-reducing bacterial cells. desulfomicrobium norvegicum reduced sulfate to sulfide  through the sulfate reduction pathway and then released sulfide into the extracellular medium  <cit> . glutathione  also reacts with se to produce gs-se-sg which will generate gs-se−. this reaction is catalyzed by a gsh reductase in purple non-sulfur bacteria such as rhodospirillum rubrum and rhodobacter capsulatus under anoxic conditions  <cit> , <cit> . a gsh reductase was also potentially involved in se reduction in pseudomonas seleniipraecipitans <cit> . unfortunately, so far no gene product or enzyme solely responsible for se reduction has been identified in vivo. several enzymes were shown to be involved in se reduction in different microbes, se reduction took place either in the cytoplasm  <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  or in the periplasm  <cit> .

we had previously isolated an antimony-oxidizing bacterium, the strictly aerobe comamonas testosteroni s <dig>  from an antimony mine in lengshuijiang, hunan province, southern china  <cit> . a large number of genes encoding putative metal resistance proteins, mobile genetic elements  and evidence of recent horizontal gene transfer  events indicate progressive adaption to this extreme environment  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the process of se reduction leading to biosynthesized nanoparticles under aerobic condition by scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy  and electron dispersion spectroscopy  elemental mapping. in addition, transposon mutagenesis was employed to identify genes responsible for selenium resistance and reduction.

RESULTS
c. testosteroni s <dig> was able to reduce se under aerobic condition
initial growth experiments confirmed that c. testosteroni s <dig> was not able to grow under anaerobic condition indicating it is an obligate aerobe. in addition, c. testosteroni s <dig> reduced se to elemental selenium that formed red nanoparticles under aerobic condition . these red-colored senps were very stable in the supernatant or on solid plates at room temperature. they were still visible after sterilization at 121°c for 30 min.

mics for se ranged from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm in lb. incubation in lb broth with less than  <dig>  mm se did not significantly affect growth of c. testosteroni s <dig> whereas it did negatively affect growth at concentrations above  <dig>  mm se . the broth obtained a weak orange color after  <dig> h incubation. se was reduced by a biological rather than chemical process because no se reduction was observed in the broth without the addition of bacterial cells. strain s <dig> was unable to reduce the entire se to elemental selenium both at low and at high se concentrations. c. testosteroni s <dig> was only able to reduce  <dig>  mm se to  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm remaining se, respectively during  <dig> h incubation in lb broth under aerobic condition .

characterization of senps produced by c. testosteroni s44
c. testosteroni s <dig> reduced se to red colored senps when grown in different media such as lb, tsb or cdm medium, with concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to 50 mm na2seo <dig>  the size of nanoparticles outside of cells ranged from 100 nm to 200 nm as judged from analysis of sem photos . the observed nanoparticles consisted of elemental selenium as determined by tem- energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy  analysis because the edx spectrum of electron dense particles showed the expected emission peaks for selenium at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  kev corresponding to the selα, sekα, and sekβ transitions, respectively . this strongly indicated se was first reduced to elemental selenium. there was no obvious difference in intracellular morphology between c. testosteroni s <dig> amended with se and the control without added se during log phase or stationary phase . we also did not observe emission peaks of elemental selenium from the spectrum of tem-edx based on suspected se-particles in cells . this indicated there were no selenium particles inside of the cells. to further investigate the distribution of selenium inside and outside of c. testosteroni s <dig> cells, eds elemental mapping was used to detect selenium localization producing elemental maps showing the composition and spatial distribution of different elements in an unknown sample. four elemental maps of carbon, chlorine, selenium and copper were obtained and shown in different colors based on the scanning area encompassing both the inside and outside of c. testosteroni s <dig> cells . the color of background was black in all elemental maps. the map of elemental chlorine  clearly showed the cell shape, distribution and density of cl in the cell . in contrast, elements carbon   and copper   were distributed both inside and outside of cells because cells were embedded by carbon-contained plastic epon before section in order to maintain the cell shape, as well as sectional samples were coated by copper grids to support thin slicing of bio-samples. however, strong signals of selenium as shown by orange color were only observed outside of cells whereas the color in cells was black background even the white dots in cells suspected to be senps were not similar to senps outside of cells , indicating that senps were only formed outside of cells rather than inside of cells. the eds map of elemental selenium was consistent with tem-edx result focusing on high density particles, i.e., senps did not occur in the interior of c. testosteroni s <dig> cells. in addition, it was clear that small senps aggregated into bigger particles outside of cells .

tungstate inhibited se but not se reduction
tungsten has been used as an inhibitor of the molybdoenzymes, since it replaces molybdenum  in the mo-cofactor  of these enzymes. tungstate did not affect reduction of se  since the same red color of the senps could be observed whether tungstate was added to cells of c. testosteroni s <dig> or not. in contrast, addition of tungstate and se resulted in no development of red colored nanoparticles as in the negative control with no added se and tungstate. in contrast, addition of se without tungstate resulted in red-colored colonies on lb agar plates . therefore, tungstate only inhibited molybdenum-dependent se reduction and subsequent reduction to elemental selenium and formation of nanoparticles. similar results were obtained in different media such as lb, tsb and cdm.

the cytoplasmic fraction strongly reduced se to senps
to help determine how se is reduced, different cellular fractions were isolated and the activity of se-reduction was determined. subcellular fractions were isolated after 12 h and 20 h growth in lb broth without se.  <dig>  mm se and  <dig>  mm nadph were added to different fractions at room temperature. after 24 h incubation, se was reduced to red-colored selenium by the cytoplasmic fraction in the presence of nadph whereas no red-colored selenium occurred in the cytoplasmic fraction without nadph, indicating se reduction was nadph-dependent . nadh gave the same results as nadph. in contrast, periplasmic and membrane fractions were only able to reduce se weakly. even after an incubation for 5 days only a few red-colored senps were observed . addition of se to the cytoplasmic fraction  but without nadph also resulted in faint reddish-colored senps after 5-days incubation, perhaps due to low amounts of residual nadph left in the cf. in addition, fractions isolated from cells grown in medium with added se had the same properties as fractions isolated from cells grown without se in the medium suggesting that se reduction was not induced by se.

iscr is necessary for resistance of se and other heavy or transition metals but not for se reduction
approximately  <dig>  transposon mutants were isolated and tested for se resistance and reduction. among these,  <dig> mutants showed lower resistance to se and delayed se reduction compared to the wild type. however, we did not find any mutant that did not reduce se to red-colored selenium. the genomic regions flanking the transposon insertion of these  <dig> sensitive mutants were sequenced and analyzed by blastx in the genbank database. we selected four representative mutants as tn <dig> was inserted into different positions of iscr in the two mutants of iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig>  additionally, two other iscr tn5-insertion mutants  and  were obtained in another research project on microbial sb resistance and oxidation in our lab. the mutant iscr- <dig> displayed even lower resistance to se than iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig>  iscr encodes a regulator of genes involved in iron-sulfur cluster genesis. thus, these four mutants iscr- <dig>  iscr- <dig>  iscr- <dig> and iscs +  <dig> were selected for further study.

the isc gene cluster contains iscsua-hscba-fdx in c. testosteroni s <dig> , encoding proteins iscs, iscu, isca, hsc <dig>  hsc <dig>  and ferredoxin responsible for fe-s assembly. the length of the isc operon was 5664 bp, the length of iscr was 537 bp encoding a transcriptional regulator . insertion sites of iscr- <dig>  iscr- <dig>  and iscr- <dig> were located at 280 bp, 327 bp and 513 bp of iscr, respectively, as well as insertion sites of iscr- <dig>  iscr- <dig> located at the predicted function domain of rrf <dig> . the gap between iscr and iscs was 78 bp, and insertion site of mutant iscs +  <dig> was located at 48 bp downstream of iscr and 30 bp upstream of iscs. in fe-s cluster assembly pathway, iscs is a cysteine desulfurase that procures the sulfur from cysteine for fe-s cluster assembly  <cit> ; iscr is an iron-sulphur  cluster containing transcription factor that represses transcription of the isc operon in e. coli, but iscrsua operon was induced under oxidative stress  <cit> , <cit> . in other bacteria, iscr was shown to both behave an activator or a repressor.

the insertional mutants were more sensitive to high concentrations of se than c. testosteroni s <dig> and also grew more slowly in 10 mm se than wild type c. testosteroni s <dig> . se reduction of iscr- <dig> and iscs +  <dig> was also delayed but not as much as iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig> . the growth of iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig> was completely inhibited in 50 mm se, whereas c. testosteroni s <dig>  iscr- <dig> and iscs +  <dig> showed slow growth and decreased se reduction. those results indicated that iscr- <dig> was the most sensitive mutant to higher concentrations of se, followed by iscr- <dig> with intermediate sensitivity in iscr- <dig> and iscs +  <dig>  and the highest resistance in wild type c. testosteroni s <dig>  despite of different resistance between wild type and iscr mutants, the presence of iscr was not essential for se reduction. for example, in 10 mm se, iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig> grew slowly with little apparent se reduction and showed faint red color after  <dig> and 16 h incubation; in contrast, the red color due to selenium nanoparticles became similar to the wild type after 24 h incubation, indicating iscr was necessary for the growth and resistance but was not necessary for se reduction to occur.

in order to understand whether iscr influenced resistance to other heavy or transition metals, we determined the growth of iscr mutants and the wild type. the wild type c. testosteroni s <dig> grew better than three iscr mutants iscr- <dig>  iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig> under heavy metals such as as , cu  and cd  . most sensitive to all metals and metalloids was insertional mutant iscr- <dig>  followed by iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig>  in addition, the mics of as , cu  and cd  in wild type c. testosteroni s <dig> were 20 mm, 4 mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. in contrast, the mics of as , cu  and cd  in mutants iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig> decreased to 10 mm, 2 mm and  <dig>  mm, respectively. those results indicated that iscr was involved in conferring resistance to a number of transition, heavy metals and metalloids in c. testosteroni s <dig> 

discussion
c. testosteroni s <dig> reduced soluble se into insoluble and thus non-toxic senps outside of cells under aerobic condition as indicated by sem/tem-edx and eds mapping analyses. it should thus be possible to synthesize senps by imitating the biological process in industrial nanomaterial manufacturing  <cit> . diseases caused by high content of se in soils have been confirmed for the chinese provinces hubei and shaanxi and indian punjab  <cit> , <cit> . in general, the variation of se level in humans and animals are correlated to both se excess and deficiency through the food chain  <cit> . plants took up less water-soluble se oxyanions from soil when bacteria reduced se to organic se and element selenium  <cit> . high levels of se are commonly associated with concurrent contamination by other heavy and/or transition metals. therefore, c. testosteroni s <dig> could be very useful for bioremediation of heavy metal polluted soils because it has adapted to a metal-contaminated environment. considering the fact that only a partial reduction of se to se could be achieved , it would be better in se bioremediation if c. testosteroni s <dig> was applied to the contaminated site together with other more efficient se-reducing bacteria.

in some bacterial strains, elemental senps were observed both inside and outside of cells  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  whereas in other bacteria nanoparticles were only observed outside of cells  <cit> . we did not detect se by hplc-hg-afs in cellular fractions  although elemental se less than  <dig>  μm meets the demand of bacteria for synthesis of selenocysteine  <cit> . we could not observe senps produced inside of cells at log phase and stationary phase by tem, edx and eds elemental mapping  although senps were easily observed by tem in many bacterial cells  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in contrast, we only observed a large number of senps appearing outside of cells . the cytoplasmic fraction showed the strongest se reducing ability contrasting with a weak reducing ability in periplasmic and membrane fractions after addition of nadph  or nadh . accordingly, the process of se reduction appears to be an nadph- or nadh-dependent pathway and indicates two possible pathways. one possibility is that se did not enter the cytoplasm of strain s <dig> or only trace levels of se were present in the cytoplasm. the se-reducing determinant might have initially been assembled in the cytoplasm and then transferred across cytoplasmic and outer membrane. the se-reducing determinant would then be only active outside of cells in vivo <cit> . another possibility, and more likely at that, is that se was reduced to se in the cytoplasm and then se was pumped out of the cells where small senps aggregated into bigger particles.

in many cases, the big and smooth-surface nanoparticles occurred outside of cells  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . here, a large number of senps ranging from 100–200 nm were observed by sem  and further confirmed by edx . in our experiment it was obvious that small selenium particles aggregated into bigger particles as observed by tem . this was different from previous tem images of a homogeneous density of senps  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in addition, this was not impacted by sample preparation because other strains produced big and homogeneous nanoparticles outside of cells using the same sample preparation and tem observation technique . previous studies confirmed small particles having low negative charges to have a propensity to come together and form aggregates  <cit> . in addition, proteins and/or other biomolecules such as polysaccharides and fatty acid may play a key role in controlling selenium nanoparticle size and the morphology of the resultant senps  <cit> . the bulk of the se and se reduction to se was reported to occur on or outside the envelope  <cit> . this is very different from the reported mechanism where selenium was bound to the assembling protein sefa and then formed nanoparticles which were exported from cells  <cit> .

in most reported cases, se reduction occurred under anaerobic condition  <cit> - <cit> . c. testosteroni s <dig> has a weak ability to reduce se into red-colored selenium under aerobic condition . the se reductase complex was identified as a periplasmic mo-containing enzyme in t. selenatis <cit> , <cit>  and b. selenatarsenatis <cit> . the se-reducing determinant of c. testosteroni s <dig> also is most likely a mo-enzyme because tungstate inhibited se reduction . in contrast, the se-reducing determinant did not appear to contain mo because tungstate did not inhibit se reduction. accordingly, se reduction is a distinct activity different from se reduction.

iron-sulfur  clusters are cofactors for many proteins across all three domains of life. fe-s proteins function in a number of cellular processes, including electron transfer, gene regulation, photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, anti-oxidative and iron stress among others  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . the genomic organization of iscrsua-hscba-fdx, the operon encoding the housekeeping fe-s biogenesis system , is conserved in many β- and γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . iscr  regulates expression of the isc pathway by modulating intracellular iron homeostasis via a negative feedback mechanism based on the cellular fe-s demand in p. aeruginosa and e. coli <cit> , <cit>  and can also increase the expression of another operon, sufabcdse, involved in synthesis of fe-s clusters in e. coli <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . iscr is part of the large rrf <dig> family of winged helix-turn-helix  transcription factors  <cit> . we could not find a suf operon on the genome of c. testosteroni s <dig>  this is similar to genome of pseudomonas spp. that is also lacking a suf operon  <cit> . as a result, only iscrsua-hscba-fdx encoding proteins are used for fe-s cluster synthesis in c. testosteroni s <dig>  in addition, iscr is a global regulator that regulates functions not only involved in fe-s biogenesis but also directly or indirectly controlling the expression of ~ <dig> genes in e. coli <cit> , <cit> . recently, it was shown that the highly conserved three cysteine residues  and his <dig> of iscr were essential for  cluster ligation  <cit> . -iscr binds both type  <dig> and type  <dig> motifs from hya promoter, thereby exhibiting metal-dependent regulation of dna binding specific for iscr  <cit> . the corresponding cluster ligands are cys <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig> and his <dig> in iscr from c. testosteroni s <dig>  the insertion sites of tn <dig> mutants, iscr- <dig> and iscr- <dig>  were close to bases encoding those four ligands. moreover, the insertion site of iscr- <dig> was located next to the bases encoding his <dig> located at residues forming a helix involved in dimerization  of iscr  <cit> , therefore disturbing the formation of iscr dimers. in contrast, the insertion site of iscr- <dig> is located at the tail end of iscr  and the insertion site in iscs +  <dig> is located at the gap between iscr and iscs . as a result, the formation and function of iscr were more strongly disturbed in iscr- <dig> and especially in iscr- <dig>  resulting in slower growth and less resistance than iscr- <dig> to heavy metals . the insertional mutants iscr- <dig> and iscs +  <dig> would still produce a functional iscr regulator  but expression of subsequent genes of the operon would be significantly lower due to polar effects of an insertion by transposon tn <dig>  those results are consistent with the result of a ∆iscr mutant that was 40- to 50-fold less resistant to organic hydroperoxides  in p. aeruginosa <cit> . therefore, iscr aids cellular growth and resistance to heavy metals not only by regulating expression of the iscsua-hscba-fdx operon, but probably also by directly or indirectly regulating expression of other genes  <cit>  in c. testosteroni s <dig> 

c. testosteroni s <dig> was isolated from an antimony mine and contained resistance determinants to various metals  <cit> . due to a large number of genes encoding putative metal resistance proteins  <cit> , c. testosteroni s <dig> is thought to be able to quickly pump heavy or transition metals and metalloids out of the cell or transform them into a less toxic species thereby becoming very resistant. this interpretation is consistent with the high mic for se and the postulated quick se secretion from the cytoplasm across the cell envelope to the outside of cells. although c. testosteroni s <dig> was resistant to high level of heavy metals, it did not reduce se efficiently. it is therefore possible c. testosteroni s <dig> evolved a balanced state between resistance of se oxyanions and reduction .

CONCLUSIONS
a strict aerobic bacterium, c. testosteroni s <dig>  reduced se and se to red senps with sizes ranging from  <dig> to 200 nm. the cytoplasmic fraction strongly reduced se to red-colored selenium in the presence of nadph but no senps were observed in cells. possibly, se was reduced in the cytoplasm and then transported out of the cell where the senps were formed.
