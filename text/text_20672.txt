BACKGROUND
for several decades, molecular data have been used to define homologous regions in the nervous system of distant phyla. more recently, homology search has moved to the cell level, using conserved neuronal-type specific molecular signatures
 <cit>  . this approach provides a novel window on the complexity of ancestral nervous systems, and sets the stage, with unprecedented detail, for an understanding of what has changed or been conserved during their large-scale evolution. in this paper, we undertake a comparison of sensorimotor circuits across the protostome/deuterostome boundary, which is, thus, informative about the nervous system of urbilateria.

ever since bichat distinguished the ‘organic’ and ‘animal’ lives
 <cit> , the vertebrate body has been construed as a dual entity, one part somatic , the other visceral . paralleling this distinction, the sensorimotor circuits passing through the spinal cord and brainstem are divided into somatic and visceral. somatic circuits are responsible for the somesthetic, visual or auditory perception of the environment and locomotory responses. the visceral circuits are responsible for sensing parameters of the interior milieu, such as arterial pressure, blood gases and various chemosensory modalities including taste, and feedback regulation of the cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive organs. specific anatomic features and embryonic origins have been progressively discovered for these circuits. for example, somatic and visceral neurons in the vertebrate hindbrain are born and settle at distinct dorso-ventral levels
 <cit> . in the peripheral nervous system, first-order visceral sensory neurons emerge from epibranchial placodes, whereas somatic ones derive from dorso-lateral placodes or the neural crest
 <cit> . in his landmark monograph on the subject, a.s. romer synthesized a century of observations on the ‘duality’ of the vertebrates, made up of two bodies , one visceral and one somatic, ‘imperfectly welded’ on each other
 <cit> . in the past years, after decades of neglect, the proposed dichotomy of the vertebrate nervous system has found, piecemeal, an unexpected molecular basis, in the form of transcription factors that globally distinguish somatic from visceral neurons  and are largely, if not completely, restricted to them. most somatic sensory neurons, first- and second-order, express the pou domain genes brn3: the touch and pain receptors of the dorsal root and cranial ganglia, auditory and vestibular neurons, ganglionic cells of the retina, and many relay sensory neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord —even if, in the latter, expression is transient and not entirely charted
 <cit>  . brn <dig> is required in all the peripheral cell types, its role in the central nervous system  being yet unexplored. somatic motoneurons express and require the combination of the homeobox genes mnx <dig> <cit>  and lhx3/ <dig> <cit> . finally, the vast majority of visceral neurons, sensory and motor, express and require the homeobox gene phox2b: visceral sensory ganglia and their target, the nucleus of the solitary tract, all autonomic ganglia; visceral motoneurons of the medulla; branchial motoneurons  and chemosensory structures, such as the carotid body and the retrotrapezoid nucleus
 <cit> . this simple, non-combinatorial code provides new tools to probe the ancestry of these broad neuronal categories.

for this study, we turned to mollusks, for two reasons: first, they belong to the phylum lophotrochozoa which, genetically less derived than ecdysozoa, is particularly valuable for comparisons across bilateria
 <cit> ; and second, mollusks have been studied by neurophysiologists for decades and consequently provide a unique catalogue of identified neurons with somatic or visceral functions
 <cit>  that allow rigorous tests of association with specific molecular signatures. using as model systems two gastropods —the opisthobranch aplysia californica and the pulmonate lymnaea stagnalis— and the decapodiform cephalopod sepia officinalis, we show that physiologically defined somatic motor and sensory neurons and visceral motoneurons share, respectively, the mnx/lhx3/ <dig>  brn <dig> and phox <dig> transcriptional signature of their vertebrate counterparts, and we discuss the evolutionary implications of this conservation across bilateria.

RESULTS
shared molecular signature of gastropod and vertebrate mechanosensory neurons
in vertebrates, the vast majority of sensory neurons that perceive the environment  express paralogues of the pou-iv/brn <dig> homeogene family, henceforth collectively called brn <dig>  these include mechanoreceptors, proprioceptors, thermoreceptors and nociceptors of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, retinal ganglion cells, vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons and inner hair cells
 <cit>  , as well as many second-order neurons in these somatic sensory pathways
 <cit>  . the evolutionary stability of this genetic signature across bilateria has been uncertain so far, based on the study of model ecdysozoans: mechanoreceptors have not been reported to express the orthologue of brn <dig> in drosophila, where it labels olfactory neurons instead
 <cit> , and they form only a small fraction of the  <dig> neurons that express the brn <dig> orthologue in caenorhabditiselegans <cit> . in the gastropod haliotis asinina, expression of brn <dig> in patches of larval ectoderm has been interpreted as marking peripheral sensory structures
 <cit> . we examined the case of a. californica, where mechanoreception and nociception are mediated, at least in part, by clusters of small-size sensory neurons in several ganglia of the cns, which synthesize the neuropeptide sensorin a
 <cit> . we cloned the aplysia orthologue of brn <dig> [see additional file
1: figure s1a] and found it expressed in the sensorin+ neuronal clusters and restricted to them in the cns . in another gastropod, the pulmonate l. stagnalis, similar clusters of small brn3+ neurons occurred in several ganglia , many of which expressed the lymnaea orthologue of sensorin  and are thus most likely homologous to the mechanoreceptors of aplysia. to further elucidate the molecular signature of these cells, we cloned the lymnaea orthologues of drgx [see additional file
1: figure s1b], largely restricted to sensory neurons in vertebrates
 <cit> , and of islet <dig> [see additional file
1: figure s1c], expressed in all vertebrate sensory neurons
 <cit>  . both were coexpressed with brn <dig> in lymnaea  as is the case for their orthologue in the touch and pain receptors of the mammalian dorsal root ganglia . in addition, lymnaea sensory clusters, like their vertebrate counterparts, expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter vglut , in line with the glutamatergic phenotype of molluscan mechanoreceptors
 <cit> . thus, the unique brn3+/drgx+/islet+/vglut+ transcriptional signature of first-order somatic sensory neurons in vertebrates, is also a hallmark of their molluscan counterparts.

shared molecular distinction between somatic and visceral motoneurons in gastropods, cephalopods and vertebrates
in vertebrates, locomotion depends on somitic muscles, innervated by spinal cord motoneurons that depend on the homeogenes mnx <dig> <cit>  and lhx3/ <dig> <cit>  and use acetylcholine as neurotransmitter. in gastropods, the muscles of locomotion  are innervated by the pedal ganglia
 <cit> . we cloned ls-mnx, the lymnaea orthologue of mnx <dig> [see additional file
1: figure s1d] and found that it was largely restricted to two clusters of neurons in the pedal ganglia , which coexpressed the orthologues of lhx3/ <dig>  and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter vacht . at least some of these cells projected in the pedal nerves, as assessed by retrograde filling  and most likely are locomotory neurons. these data extend the observations that some motoneurons in drosophila also express lim <dig>  and mnx <cit> , that some c. elegans motoneurons express a mnx orthologue
 <cit> , and that the nkx6+ domain of the annelid nerve cord gives rise to mnx+/vacht+ putative motoneurons
 <cit> . thus, the mnx+/lhx3/4+ molecular signature has been associated with somatic motoneurons since the origin of bilaterians.

we next examined the visceral nervous system, whose sensorimotor circuits in vertebrates largely coincide with the expression pattern of the paralogous homeogenes phox2a and phox2b  and depend on the latter for their formation
 <cit> . among deuterostomes, we previously found that the ciona intestinalis orthologue of phox <dig> is specifically expressed in neurons of the cerebral ganglion of postmetamorphic animals that motorize the respiratory and digestive ‘branchial basket’
 <cit> . concerning protostomes, the c. elegans orthologue of phox <dig> marks specifically five neurons
 <cit>  whose function is either unknown  or hard to classify as somatic or visceral . the inconclusiveness of the latter finding is compounded by the fact that most visceral organs in c. elegans either lack innervation  or are missing altogether . in a. californica, several neurons with cardiovascular, respiratory or excretory functions have been identified by size and location in the abdominal ganglion. one of the best documented, the multimodal motoneuron l <dig>  directly innervates the muscles of the gill, siphon, epineural sheath, heart and abdominal aorta
 <cit>  , and serves as premotor neuron for the branchial ganglion
 <cit> . we cloned ac-phox <dig>  the aplysia orthologue of phox <dig> [see additional file
1: figure s1b] and found it expressed in l <dig>  recognizable by its large size and position at the left border of the abdominal ganglion, rostral to the other large  neuron in the region, l <dig>  which projects in the genital nerve but whose function is unknown . among the other neurons expressing phox <dig> was a large cluster occupying the ‘right upper quadrant’ of the ganglion , which includes the giant r3-r <dig> cells
 <cit>  that innervate the heart, major arteries and veins, digestive gland sheath and kidney
 <cit> . many neurons that are smaller than the r3-r <dig> cells were also positive for phox <dig> in this region. these might correspond to the extra cells found to share with r3-r <dig> electrical activity
 <cit> , immunoreactivity for the cardiomodulator peptide ndwfamide
 <cit>  and, thus, possibly a function. a giant phox2+ cell located close to the branchial nerve corresponded to r <dig> , which shares its targets with the r3-r <dig> group
 <cit> . the r3-r <dig> neurons are thought to modulate heart beat frequency and local aspects of circulatory physiology using, among others, the peptide hrbp
 <cit>  as neurotransmitter. the kidney also receives input from giant neurons of the ‘left upper quadrant’. among those, l <dig> is uniquely identified by expression of the peptide encoding the luq- <dig> gene
 <cit> , allowing us to show on consecutive sections that it was phox2+ . in lymnaea, large ‘light yellow cells’ 
 <cit>  are considered homologous to the r3-r <dig> neurons on the basis of their size, color, location, synthesis of a peptide similar to hrbp
 <cit>  and projections to the heart, aorta, kidney, and connective tissue of the cns
 <cit> . we cloned lymnaea phox <dig> [see additional file
1: figure s1b] and found that it was expressed in all lycs of the ventro-lateral lobe of the right parietal ganglion, identified by their position and expression of the lyc pro-peptide . retrograde filling showed that they projected in the right parietal nerves , which innervate the mantle cavity and pneumostome
 <cit> , suggesting an additional role in ventilation.

as a further test of the vertebrate-like molecular signature of visceral and somatic motoneurons in mollusks, we explored a second molluscan clade, cephalopoda. in decapodiform cephalopods , the brachial ganglion and anterior part of the pedal ganglion contain motoneurons for the prehensile and locomotory arms, while the palliovisceral ganglion contains motoneurons for the visceral mass
 <cit> . we cloned the orthologues of mnx and phox <dig> in s. officinalis [see additional file
1: figure s1b,d] and found that mnx, but not phox <dig>  was expressed throughout the anterior pedal lobe  while phox <dig>  but not mnx, was expressed in the palliovisceral ganglion . some of the palliovisceral ganglionic neurons are presynaptic to the motoneurons of the mantle, which make up most of the stellate ganglion, a synapomorphy of this clade. phox <dig>  but not mnx, was expressed in most stellate ganglionic neurons . thus, mantle motoneurons, which control water flow over the gills, express phox <dig>  like the branchial motoneurons that perform the same function in fish
 <cit> . apart from their respiratory function, motoneurons to the mantle  allow rapid water ejection and jet-propulsion of the animal. the molecular identity of these escape motoneurons thus correlates with the ancestral function of the target organ  rather than with its additional, derived function . a conceptually similar but inverse situation can be described in terrestrial  vertebrates, whose respiratory motoneurons  are somatic, that is, have kept the identity matching the embryonic origin  and ancestral function  of their target muscles.
 <cit> , showing the way in which the axons of stellate ganglion neurons progressively fuse to form the third order giant fibers  that allow jet-propulsion.  schematic of the central nervous system and stellate ganglion of sepia. br, brachial ganglion; d, dorsal; p, posterior; pa, anterior pedal ganglion; pp, posterior pedal ganglion; pv, palliovisceral ganglion; so, supraesophageal mass; st, stellate ganglion. scale bars,  <dig> μm ;  <dig> μm .

hence, molluscan motoneurons that innervate the viscera are distinguished from those that innervate the locomotory muscles by the same transcriptional code  as their vertebrate counterparts.

discussion
we have shown that molecular signatures for neurons with somatic  versus visceral  functions are conserved between vertebrates and mollusks. visceral motoneurons,  express the orthologue of the vertebate pan-visceral determinant phox2b in opisthobranch and pulmonate gastropods and a decapodiform cephalopod. no other transcription factor or neurotransmitter phenotype marks these neurons, specifically or exhaustively, in vertebrates, precluding a more complex signature. however, phox2b expression is highly selective for visceral neurons  in vertebrates
 <cit>  and, thus, in combination with hodological criteria, constitutes a strong argument for homology. neurons with modalities clearly equivalent to those of visceral sensory neurons in vertebrates  are not described to our knowledge in mollusks, precluding exploration of this broad neuronal identity. of note, in vertebrates, the viscerosensory phenotype is imposed by phox2b on a somatosensory default identity
 <cit> , suggesting that the former is evolutionarily more recent than the latter. locomotory  motor neurons express the orthologues of the homeobox genes mnx <dig> and lhx3/ <dig> and vacht in both gastropods and cephalopods, like their counterparts in the spinal cord of vertebrates. finally, somatic sensory neurons , characterized in gastropods by previous electrophysiological studies or expression of the peptide sensorin a, selectively express the orthologues of the homeodomain genes brn <dig>  drgx, and islet <dig> and vglut, like their physiological counterparts in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia of vertebrates.

what evolutionary relationship can explain the conservation of molecular signatures in neurons with visceral versus somatic functions between deuterostomes and protostomes? the simplest hypothesis is that the cells are phylogenetically homologous, that is, one could trace their ancestry to an original neuron or neuronal cluster in the common ancestor, as was proposed for ciliary photoreceptors in annelids and vertebrates
 <cit>  or for branchial motoneurons in vertebrates and urochordates
 <cit> . this might also be the case for somatic motoneurons in vertebrates and lophotrochozoans: their distribution is spatially discrete in each phylum and reconcilable between phyla. in vertebrates, locomotory mnx+ neurons are born in a ventral nkx <dig> + domain of the spinal cord, topologically and molecularly similar to the ventral domain of the nerve cord of annelids, which produces mnx+/vacht+ neurons, presumably motor
 <cit> . in mollusks, they are restricted to the pedal ganglia, conceivably homologous to the ventral nerve cord of annelids.

on the other hand, phylogenetic homology between vertebrates and mollusks is unlikely, at least in most cases, for somatic sensory neurons and visceral motor neurons, due to their anatomical distribution, widespread in each species  and hard to reconcile between them. moreover, phox <dig> is expressed in synapomorphic structures of vertebrates  and cephalopods . in this case, the most likely evolutionary scenario is that, in the last common ancestor, a ‘seminal regulatory interaction’
 <cit>  arose between brn <dig> and the somatic sensory phenotype and between phox <dig> and the visceral phenotype. although no target gene has been uncovered yet that would explain the physiological dichotomy these transcription factors specify, one can hypothesize, for example, that they direct axonal projections towards somatic versus visceral targets. subsequently, this regulatory interaction would have been conserved, while brn <dig> and phox <dig> acquired additional expression sites, giving rise to novel groups of cells of the same broad type along each evolutionary lineage. according to this view, the relationship between the different kinds of somatosensory neurons or visceromotor neurons would be neither of phylogenetic homology  nor of ‘sister cell types’ , but instead, both between and within species, of ‘deep’
 <cit>  or ‘generative’
 <cit>  homology, akin to that proposed for bilaterian appendages.

CONCLUSIONS
regardless of the exact nature of what has been conserved across the protostome-deuterostome boundary, either neuronal groups or regulatory links between transcription factors and neuronal traits, our data show that the viscerosomatic duality of the nervous system, as described in vertebrates, was already part of the urbilaterian body plan. some of its components might be even more ancient, as suggested by expression of a brn <dig> orthologue in the sensory ‘rhopalia’ of scyphozoan and cubozoan jellyfish
 <cit> . to our knowledge, mnx has not been analyzed in the nervous system of cnidarians. finally, no straightforward orthologue of phox <dig> emerges from sequence analysis of paired-like homeobox genes in cnidaria [see additional file
1: figure s1b], which complicates the search for a pre-bilaterian origin of the visceral nervous system.
