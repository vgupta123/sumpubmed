BACKGROUND
micrornas  are noncoding, regulatory rnas approximately  <dig> nt long that negatively regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels via post-transcriptional cleavage of mrna, inhibition of translation and rna-dependent rna polymerase -mediated second-strand synthesis, and trans-acting small interfering rnas  initiated by mirna and mirna-dependent dna methylation . initially discovered in c. elegans  <cit> , they have now been widely reported in plants and animals  <cit> , and some mirnas or mirna-like rnas have even been reported in viruses and fungi  <cit> . in recent years, increasing evidence has demonstrated that mirnas are involved in the regulation of many biological and metabolic processes such as development, signal transduction, metabolism and response to environmental signals in plants .

environmental signals such as ultraviolet  and blue regions of the light spectrum are important for plants to control a wide range of processes during growth and development  <cit> . at least two classes of photoreceptors, mainly uv-b receptors and cryptochromes, absorb uv and blue light, respectively, in plants . blue and uv-a light-mediated photomorphogenic responses include de-etiolation, phototropism, stomatal opening, and anthocyanin accumulation  <cit> , which are controlled by light-responsive genes. in particular, blue and uv-a light induce transcription of the genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis of brassica rapa subsp. rapa  <cit> . blue and uv-b light have also been reported to mediate mirnas that regulate genes in maize and arabidopsis  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis, cryptochrome  <dig>  and cryptochrome  <dig>  mediate the expression of mir <dig> after blue light stimulation in a constans -independent manner to regulate photoperiodic flowering time  <cit> . four mirnas  also respond to uv-b and might be involved in auxin signaling pathways of arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, mirna <dig> exposed to uv-b radiation in leaves of arabidopsis is upregulated, leading to a decrease in transcripts of growth-regulating factor genes  which result in inhibition of cell proliferation and leaf growth  <cit> . moreover, mir <dig> is coordinately regulated by squamosa promoter binding protein-like <dig>  and elongated hypocotyl <dig>  in arabidopsis, and the transcription levels of mir <dig> and its target genes are also changed in response to light and copper  <cit> . in maize, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are up-regulated, while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are down-regulated under uv-b radiation treatment. furthermore, both mir <dig> and mir <dig> are decreased and their several targets  are increased after 8h uv-b in maize leaves  <cit> .

to date, high-throughput sequencing has revealed novel micrornas in different organs at different stages of development of b. rapa subsp. pekinensis cv. chiifu  <cit> , in seedlings of b. rapa subsp. chinensis stressed by heat  <cit>  and in skotomorphogenic seedlings of b. rapa subsp. rapa cv. tsuda  <cit> . in addition, many light signal transduction factors and genes involved in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis have been extensively studied in brassica rapa  <cit> , but the mirnas that are responsive to blue and uv-a light have not yet been systematically identified and characterized at the genome level.

turnip  is an important and popular cruciferous root vegetable. the turnip cv. tsuda, a purple top cultivar, accumulates the anthocyanidin pelargonidin in swollen hypocotyls and in the upper mid-section of hypocotyls of the seedling after exposure to sunlight and blue and uv-a light  <cit> . because of the health-promoting role of anthocyanins, this red turnip cultivar tsuda is very desirable, and its blue and uv-a light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis is especially suitable to study the role of mirnas in regulating anthocyanin production in response to various wavelengths of light.

to identify mirnas involved in light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in brassica rapa, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to obtain differentially expressed conserved and novel mirnas in response to blue light, uv-a and dark treatment. a set of mirnas and their targets were found to be involved in the regulation of light-induced photomorphogenic phenotype in seedlings of brassica rapa. the most abundant mirna156/ <dig> could negatively regulate the transcript level of their targets spl <dig> and spl <dig> in the anthocyanin biosynthetic seedlings under blue light and uv-a induction. the identification of blue and uv-a light-responsive mirnas could aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying plant response to light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis.

RESULTS
high-throughput analysis of small rnas responsive to blue and uv-a light
a small rna  library obtained from seedlings of turnip grown in the dark for  <dig> days as control and induced by blue light or uv-a for  <dig> day after growing in the dark for  <dig> days as treatment were sequenced using the solexa system. a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from the dark, blue and uv-a small rna library, respectively. among the clean reads, small rna sequences varied widely in length ; the number of 20–24-nt sequences significantly outnumbered the shorter or longer sequences . the number of these 20–24-nt small rnas accounted for  <dig>  % of the total sequences for the dark treatment,  <dig>  % for blue and  <dig>  % for uv-a. the blue and the uv-a light treatments generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique srnas, respectively, fewer than in the dark treatment . compared with srnas in the dark treatment,  <dig>  % of the srnas were specific to blue light, while  <dig>  % of the srnas were specific to uv-a . moreover,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % unique sequences were obtained from dark-, blue- and uv-a-treated seedlings, respectively, and they mapped completely onto the brassica a genome from b. rapa  . also,  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  small rna reads from the dark, blue and uv-a small rna library, respectively, were annotated as mirnas. the rest of the sequences were found to be other types of rna, including unannotated rna, trna, rrna, small nuclear rna , small nucleolar rna  and intron or exon sequences. the numbers and proportions of different categories of small rnas are shown in table  <dig>  the results revealed that the proportion of known mirnas in blue- or uv-a-treated seedlings was lower than in the dark-grown seedlings.fig.  <dig> venn diagram of unique srnas in srna library for tsuda seedlings after blue light or uv-a treatment in comparison with the dark treatment. left, dark-control specific srnas  vs. blue-light specific ; right, dark-control specific srnas vs. uv-a specific

identification of conserved and novel candidate mirnas in seedlings of b. rapa subsp. rapa cv. tsuda after different light treatments
all unique small rna sequences were aligned with the currently known mirnas in the mirna database mirbase  and then screened to determine their hairpin structures. in total,  <dig> precursors belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families in the dark-responsive mirnas,  <dig> precursors belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families in the uv-a-responsive mirna library, and  <dig> precursors belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families in the blue-light-responsive mirna library were separately identified as homologs of known mirna families from diverse plant species . among these families, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> were abundant, accounting for more than  <dig> % of the total conserved and novel mirna reads in dark-, blue-light- and uv-a-responsive srna libraries.

to uncover novel mirnas from b. rapa, all unannotated srnas were analyzed using a bioinformatic approach. according to criteria for annotating novel plant mirnas  <cit> ,  <dig> mirna sequences  from  <dig> loci were identified . among these mirnas,  <dig> novel mirnas  were found in all three srna libraries. only four novel mirnas  were detected in blue-light- and uv-a-specific-responsive srna libraries.

differential expression of mirnas in response to dark, blue and uv-a light
based on the results of high-throughput sequencing, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were only detected in the uv-a srna library, mir <dig> was only found in the blue srna library, and mir <dig> and mir <dig> were identified only in the dark srna library. by normalizing the number of mirna reads  in the library, the relative abundance of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> in the uv-a srna library was  <dig> times higher than in the dark srna library, whereas the abundance of mir <dig> and mir <dig> was the opposite. in the blue-light-responsive srna library, aside from mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  mir <dig> was more abundant than in the dark srna library, whereas mir <dig> and mir <dig> were less abundant. however, the transcription level of most mirnas did not obviously differ in the seedlings among the dark, blue light and uv-a light treatments . among the novel mirnas,  <dig> candidate mirnas were downregulated, and  <dig> were upregulated more than 2-fold after uv-a treatment. in particular, brmirc <dig> and brmirc <dig> were upregulated more than 4-fold after uv-a. moreover,  <dig> candidate mirnas were downregulated, and  <dig> candidate mirnas were upregulated more than 2-fold after blue light. there were also  <dig> candidate mirnas specific to the uv-a-light-induced library,  <dig> candidate mirnas specific to blue-light-induced library and  <dig> specific to the dark-treatment library .fig.  <dig> differential expression of mirnas in tsuda seedings after dark, blue light or uv-a treatment. red dots denote the ratio of log 2 ≥ 1; blue dots denote the ratio of log  <dig>  ≤ −1



expression analysis of potential mirnas responsive to dark, blue and uv-a light by qrt-pcr and rna blot
to confirm the original high-throughput sequencing results, we selected three conserved mirnas  as examples to analyze their expression using an rna blot. in addition, five novel candidate mirnas and brmir <dig> were analyzed by real time pcr. the rna blot and real time pcr results demonstrated that all tested mirnas were expressed in seedlings in the dark, blue light and uv-a treatments and that the transcription levels of the different mirnas varied . transcription of most of the selected mirnas  was higher after the blue light treatment than after the dark or the uv-a light treatment . northern blot showed that the transcription level of brmir <dig> was not significantly different among the seedlings from the dark, blue and uv-light induction, while the expression of brmir <dig> was slightly inhibited by blue and uv-a light . when the relative expression levels of candidate micrornas shown in rna blots  or by rt-pcr were compared with the normalized reads of micrornas from the high-throughput sequencing library of the dark, blue light and uv-a light induced seedlings, all selected mirnas had the same expression profiles as in the original high-throughput sequencing results .fig.  <dig> transcript expression of conserved and novel mirna predicted from tsuda after treatment with dark, blue light or uv-a. relative expression  of conserved brmir <dig> and predicted brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig> was analyzed by real time pcr, and the qrt-pcr products were separated by electrophoresis. the ubq gene was used as the internal control, and seedlings in the dark control were used as the calibrator. lanes: m, size marker ; d, dark; b, blue light; a, uv-a. each bar indicates the mean ± se of triplicate assays after correcting for template quantity relative to the ubq gene. the dotted line indicates the normalized reads for the corresponding mirnas from high-throughput sequencing

prediction of mirna target genes
the putative target genes for all identified mirnas from the seedlings in the different light treatments were predicted by using psrna target program. in total,  <dig> potential targets genes were found for  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> for  <dig> novel mirnas . many of the mirnas had multiple targets, indicating the diverse regulatory roles of these mirnas. certainly, the targets that are common to more than one mirna, such as bra <dig> , bra <dig> , bra <dig> , bra <dig> , also have different mirna-binding sites, indicative of the complex regulatory network of mirnas. most of these putative target genes encode transcription factors such as spl , auxin response factor  , myeloblastosis  , basic leucine zipper  , agamous-like  , wrky  and apetala <dig>  , which have known or putative functions in a wide variety of biological processes. interestingly, mir <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig> targeted genes that encode nam, ataf <dig>   <dig>  and cuc <dig>  proteins, and mir <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig> targeted genes encoding a disease resistance protein  tir-  nbs-  lrr class). genes targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and brmirc <dig> encode a pentatricopeptide  repeat-containing protein. in addition, some mirnas targeted genes that are involved in light signal transduction and morphogenic responses. for example, mir <dig> was predicted to target a cop <dig>  homolog, mir <dig> was predicted to target spa <dig> , brmirc <dig> was predicted to target cry <dig>  and brmirc <dig> was predicted to target phytochrome and flowering time regulatory protein  <dig> 

analysis of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and their targets after blue light and uv-a exposure
in the high-throughput sequencing analyses of the blue light and uv-a induction compared with the dark treatment, mir <dig> and mir <dig> had about  <dig> -fold change in their transcript numbers. rt-pcr also showed a significant change in expression of mir <dig> after uv-a treatment compared with the dark treatment , but under blue light treatment compared with the dark treatment the expression did not differ significantly   .

we then explored mir <dig> and mir <dig> and their putative targets in more detail. the  <dig> target genes of mir <dig> and mir <dig> belong to  <dig> members of the spl gene family and have highly conserved sequences in the binding site . rt-pcr showed that the expression of predicted targets spl <dig>  and spl <dig>  induced by blue light and uv-a was approximately  <dig> times higher than in the dark treatment. the transcript level of the other detected targets, spl <dig> , spl <dig> , spl <dig>  and spl <dig> , did not differ significantly among seedlings grown in the dark, blue or uv-a light . the mir157-guided cleavage of target spl <dig> mrnas  and spl <dig> mrnas  was detected as expected. the cleavage sites were  <dig> or  <dig> bases from the 5′ ends of the binding region in the mir <dig> sequences  .table  <dig> predicted binding site of mir <dig> and mir <dig> on sequences of candidate target genes in spl family

discussion
in this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to obtain more knowledge about gene regulation by mirnas induced by blue light and uv-a, which induce anthocyanin biosynthesis in seedlings of the tsuda cultivar of brassica rapa subsp. rapa. by comparing the mirnas and the mirna precursors in arabidopsis with the srna library of blue- and uv-a-treated seedlings of tsuda turnip, we were able to identify the most common conserved mirna families in the cultivar. certainly, many tsuda turnip-specific mirnas were also obtained, but the number of reads was limited , and most were not over  <dig>  this result is consistent with our previous research on the dark-treated seedlings  <cit> .

as technology has developed, a number of mirnas have been identified in plants, and their roles in regulation have begun to be elucidated. for example, higher levels of pigments accumulated in transgenic arabidopsis which over-expressed hy5-regulated mir <dig>  resulting in a phenotype opposite of the lower pigment levels caused by a mutation in hy <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> mediates photoperiodic flowering independent of constans in arabidopsis . high-throughput sequencing of brassica rapa subsp. chinensis showed that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were downregulated under heat stress, while mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> significantly increased  <cit> . in our light-induced rna library, brmir <dig>  brmir <dig>  brmir <dig> and brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig>  brmirc <dig> were induced by both blue light and uv-a. furthermore, mir156/ <dig>  mir159/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir170/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which are responsive to uv-b in arabidopsis  <cit> , were all detected in light-treated seedlings of brassica rapa, but most had no obvious difference in transcription level. only mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig> induced by uv-a, mir <dig>  mir <dig> induced by blue light, mir <dig> induced by blue and uv-a light showed over  <dig> -fold change in expression compared with the levels in dark-treated seedlings . in the analysis of the predicted targets, the brmir <dig> target was annotated as flavin adenine dinucleotide  binding, the brmir <dig> target as a cop <dig>  homolog, the brmir <dig> target as a potassium transporter family protein, the brmirc <dig> target as a cytochrome family protein, the brmirc <dig> target myb domain protein  <dig>  the brmirc <dig> target as potassium transporter  <dig>  most of these targets are involved in photomorphogenesis and signal transduction .

interestingly, mir <dig> and mir <dig> had the most reads in our detected srna libraries. although the fold change in transcript levels decreased about  <dig>  fold in the blue light and in uv-a treatment compared with the dark treatment, the read numbers for mir <dig> and mir <dig> were over  <dig>  less in the tsuda seedlings grown in blue or uv-a light than in the dark. additionally, the rna blot and the rt-pcr also showed little downregulation of mir <dig> or mir <dig> in blue light and uv-a light. the downregulation expression pattern of mir <dig> in light-induced anthocyanin synthesis seedlings of turnip is consistent with that in arabidopsis under exogenous sugar induction  <cit> . the level of mir <dig> is also reduced when the plant grows from the juvenile phase to adult phase and the expression of mir <dig> dwindles, ultimately leading to the reproductive phase transition . the targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  spl transcription factor families, play important roles in regulating diverse aspects of plant growth and development including the vegetative phase and floral transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, mir <dig> is also positively regulated by spls, and a negative feedback loop regulates the expression of its targets  <cit> . our results also showed that the mir <dig> and mir <dig> targets, spl <dig> and spl <dig>  were specifically upregulated by blue light and uv-a light in tsuda seedlings. the difference of expression between mir156/ <dig> and spl <dig>  spl <dig> suggests that mir <dig> or mir <dig> may target spl <dig> and spl <dig> more effectively than other spls and may be involved in photomorphogenesis induced by blue light and uv-a light during the seedling development of tsuda. a regulatory relationship may exist between mirna  <dig>  mirna <dig> and their targets spl <dig>  spl <dig> although we cannot exclude the possibility that spl <dig> and spl <dig> are upregulated by other blue or uv-a light responsive transcription factors.

the spl genes targeted by mir <dig> can be grouped into four categories: spl9/spl <dig>  spl6/spl <dig>  spl11/spl10/spl <dig> and spl3/spl4/spl <dig>  <cit> . spl <dig> and spl <dig> regulate shoot maturation and leaf initiation  <cit> . overexpression of mir <dig> in switchgrass   <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and brassica napus  <cit>  led to reduced spl <dig> expression, increased shoot branching or enhanced carotenoid content . on the other hand, reduced mir <dig> activity in arabidopsis results in a high level of spl <dig> and negatively regulates anthocyanin accumulation by competing with tt <dig> in binding to anthocyanin-specific r2r3-mybs to disrupt the stabilization of the myb-bhlh-wd <dig>  complex  <cit> . the activity of mbw transcription factor complexes is essential to activate anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and thus for anthocyanin pigments to accumulate  <cit> . in this regard, the stability of the mbw complex might be increasingly impaired as the level of mir <dig> and mir <dig> transcripts decreases in seedlings of turnip exposed to blue light and uv-a light. the arabidopsis mutant sk <dig> expresses mir156b at a higher level than in the wild type, and mir156b-induced spl <dig> suppression is partially responsible for the increased carotenoid abundance in seeds and altered morphology of the mutant adult plant  <cit> . moreover, photosynthates promote the vegetative phase change by repressing the expression of mir <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . our results also showed that when dark-grown seedlings were exposed to blue or uv-a light, the transcript level of mir <dig> and mir <dig> decreased, thus reducing the suppression of their targets spl <dig> and spl15; the seedlings had the photomorphogenic phenotype such as anthocyanin biosynthesis, short hypocotyls, and cotyledon expansion .fig.  <dig> phenotype of brassica rapa subsp. rapa cv. tsuda seedling and anthocyanin content after dark, blue light or uv-a treatment. seedlings were exposed to blue light at  <dig> w m− <dig>  uv-a at  <dig> w m− <dig>  or to no light . anthocyanin was extracted from fresh whole seedlings, and the concentration was determined using absorbance at od <dig> per gram of fresh mass. vertical bars indicate ± se 



on the basis of our data and previous studies , we can deduce that blue light/uv-a activates light signal transduction genes, some of which positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in seedlings of brassica rapa subsp. rapa cv. tsuda. when positive anthocyanin biosynthesis regulators such as r2r3-myb, basic helix-loop-helix , wd <dig>  <cit>  express increasingly by light induction, then negative feedback involving mirnas such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and their targets spl <dig> and spl <dig> are also activated to negatively regulate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and maintain a new balance for the transcription of the biosynthetic genes in seedlings of tsuda turnip. thus, light induces the maximum expression of these regulated genes. previous studies on tsuda seedlings also showed that the expression of chalcone synthase gene , dihydroflavonol 4-reductase gene  and production of anthocyanin pigment  <dig> gene , which are activated by mbw in blue light and uv-a, declined to low levels after they reached a peak  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
light-responsed mirnas were identified by solexa sequencing of the srna library from photomorphogenic seedlings of brassica rapa subsp. rapa cv. tsuda exposed to blue light and uv-a. a qrt-pcr and northern blot analysis confirmed the expression profiles of a subset of conserved and novel mirnas that were identified by high-throughput sequencing from the seedlings grown in the dark, blue light, or uv-a. many putative targets for these mirnas were predicted to be involved in plant growth, development and response to light. transcripts of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were the most abundant in the srna library, and their respective targets spl <dig> and spl <dig> were shown to vary greatly in transcription level during seedlings photomorphogenesis from dark to blue-light- or uv-a-light-exposed. these results provide new insights into blue and uv-a light-responsive mirnas in the seedlings of turnip and supply evidence for mir156/157-guided cleavage of target spl <dig>  and spl <dig> .
