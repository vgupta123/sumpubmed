BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  comprise an important component of the innate immune system in protecting the host from microorganisms. mammals produce many different antimicrobial peptides that are active against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, protozoans, fungi and some viruses  <cit> . the amps may either exhibit their antimicrobial activity directly as gene encoded products or after processing from longer precursor proteins by proteolytic cleavage. many amps are also involved in functions that are not directly associated with the innate immune response. under normal physiological conditions hepcidin is an important regulator of iron homeostasis in the liver and macrophages  <cit> , but it can also acts as microbicidal and fungicidal amp  <cit> . another amp, the neutrophil granule derived peptide cap <dig>  which binds to gram-negative bacterial endotoxins, can also act as signaling molecule causing the up-regulation of protein kinase c activity  <cit> .

individual amps may have distinct functions in different locations, for example at mucosal surfaces or in phagocytes, and must be differentially regulated depending on the presence or absence of a pathogen challenge. amps may also need to be expressed in a concerted manner. although amps are intensely studied on protein level  <cit>  data and progress on transcriptional control mechanism of amps is limited to a few families such as beta-defensins and cathelicidins  <cit> . therefore, we aim in this study at the computational identification of amp promoter elements , followed by the characterization of commonalities and differences of pes among ampcg families within one species and across different species. since the study was conducted within the framework of the fantom <dig>  <cit>  project, our sequence sources are riken mouse full-length cdnas . these sequences were used to extract the promoter regions from mouse alpha-defensin, apoa <dig>  beta-defensin, bpi, spag <dig>  cathelicidin, calgranulin, dbi, slpi, granulin, hepcidin, histone2a, lactoferrin, lysozyme, mbp, melanotropin alpha, proenkaphalin, secretogranin, spyy, vasostatin, vip and zap ampcg families and their human and rat orthologs.

RESULTS
extraction of ampcgs and their promoter sequences
the initial steps of this ampcg promoter study comprise the identification of ampcg cdnas in the fantom <dig> data set and their orthologous human or rat sequences. ampcg transcripts can be identified by keyword, gene ontology term, motif or sequence similarity searches or combinations thereof. since the identification of ampcg riken mouse flcdnas started during the fantom <dig> annotation when gene names and gene ontology were not yet stable, we extracted candidate sequences using tblastn  <cit>  sequence similarity search against a set of known amp sequences   <cit> . of  <dig> mouse candidates with sequence identities equal or greater than 60% to known amps over the length of  <dig> residues and with e-values of  <dig>  or less, five were recognized as false positives by checking their stable gene name and gene ontology annotations. in total, we identified  <dig> ampcg sequences. when subtracting previously published fantom <dig> and  <dig> sequences we obtained  <dig> mouse amps members that were new in fantom <dig>  the sequences belonged to  <dig> families . the majority of new mouse amp-coding cdnas were derived from macrophage, adipocyte and testis cdna libraries.

the definition of true orthology across species is difficult in multigene families associated with innate immunity, wherein gene duplication is a common feature of evolution. for example, we found that s <dig>  has three human myeloid-associated family members s100a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  but only two  members in mice  <cit> . similarly, we noticed that the mouse amp casein delta , defensin-related sequence cryptidin peptide , mast cell protease family , and histone2a , did not have the corresponding family members in human . on the other hand, the rnase a family member rnase  <dig> was found in human, but was absent in mouse.

we restricted our analysis to mouse fantom <dig>  rat and human sequence data because our approach aimed at finding differences and similarities among mammalian orthologs of mouse. orthologs of mouse genes in frog, fish or invertebrates are too distant for promoter analyses and often lack accurate promoter sequence data. therefore we considered only a subset of bona fide orthologous mouse, human and rat promoter sequences representing only  <dig> out of  <dig> amp families. thirty-one promoter region sequences were derived from mouse,  <dig> from human orthologs and  <dig> from rat orthologs . mouse cryptidins were included in the alpha-defensin family because they represent a subfamily of alpha-defensins  <cit> .

ab initio motif discovery in ampcg promoter sequences
a commonly applied method for identifying motifs in promoter regions of co-regulated genes utilizes predetermined position-weight matrices for known tf binding sites  of transfac  <cit> , jaspar  <cit>  and other databases. another popular method for discovering motifs enriched in co-regulated genes is biclustering of genes and conditions  <cit> . in this study the ab initio motif discovery method was used because it permits the sequence context-dependent identification of both new and known tfbs motifs. although there are several ab initio motif discovery programs available  <cit> , none of them showed a distinct advantage over the others on all data types. therefore, we compared the performances of dmb  <cit> , an in-house developed program with two other programs, meme  <cit>  and improbiser  <cit> . all three programs use ab initio motif discovery algorithms based on expectation maximization. we used the promoter sequences of the proenkephalin  amp group , which has been studied empirically in transfection assays. penk promoters are known to possess a tata box and respond to cyclic amp, glucocorticoids and protein kinase c  agonists  <cit> . since improbizer identified only six motifs, we first considered the top six motifs produced by each of these systems. among the top six motifs, dmb- reported three motifs  that may bind tfs known to control the penk promoter  <cit> . meme reported one motif  and improbiser two  motifs. since dmb and meme can identify arbitrary number of motifs, we also compared the top  <dig> motifs generated by dmb and meme. seven dmb-derived motifs coincided with known tfbss   <cit>  known to control penk promoter. meme yielded only three known penk promoter motifs . considering the differences in performance and the longer computation time of meme we used dmb throughout the entire analysis. the ab initio determined known and new motifs and their distribution among ampcg families are shown in supplementary table  <dig>  additional file  <dig> and in table  <dig>  respectively. forty-one  out of  <dig> experimentally confirmed ampcg family-associated tfs may bind to predicted known dmb-derived motifs . for each amp family, motifs were discovered that did not match any of the known transfac-contained motifs and were reported as "unknown motifs". another set of motifs matched to known tfbs but were previously not reported to control ampcgs. these new ampcg-associated candidates are shown in table  <dig> 

over-represented tf binding motifs that are conserved among ampcg families
the transcriptional regulation of ampcg families varies from family to family because of the different tissue cell-specific expression and amp characteristics. thus, one would not expect that different ampcg families show significant similarities in their promoter element organization. to test whether similarities exist and which tfs may control more than one ampcg family we searched for shared ampcg family motifs . we found eight shared motif groups among  <dig> motif instances that present  <dig> mouse,  <dig> human and  <dig> rat amp promoter sequences . these results indicate the existence of a core tf set that may be part of the transcription activation mechanism in the examined ampcg families of all three species.

each of the motif families is represented by a consensus motif obtained from all motif instances in that family. the consensus motif aggaaa is known to be recognized by the tfs pea <dig>  c-ets <dig>  e74a, pu. <dig>  lyf- <dig>  c-ets- <dig>  isgf- <dig>  nf-at <dig>  nf-at <dig>  nf-at <dig> and deaf- <dig>  consensus motifs acagca and atggag are specific for gr and nkx2- <dig>  respectively. consensus motif cccgcccc corresponds to binding site for tfs sp1/sp <dig>  tggcatt is recognized by nf- <dig> 

the four consensus motifs found in mouse, rat and human corresponded to published and experimentally confirmed ampcg-associated tfs. the gr transcription factor motif acagca was conserved among  <dig> genes of ten different ampcg families in mouse, rat and human. pea <dig>  c-ets <dig>  pu. <dig>  lyf- <dig>  c-ets- <dig>  nf-at <dig>  nf-at <dig> and nf-at4-specific motif aggaaa was observed in  <dig> genes belonging to  <dig> ampcg families. sp <dig> and sp3-specifc motif cccgcccc appeared in  <dig> genes derived from six ampcg families. nf- <dig> motif tggcatt was present in  <dig> genes of nine ampcg families . consensus motif ccaggg was observed in  <dig> genes of eight ampcg families; acctgg was present in  <dig> genes of seven ampcg families; tctttc motif occurred in  <dig> genes of nine ampcg families. these findings imply the presence of common pes that may form part of a core transcription initiation control program for ampcg families.

another four motifs appeared to be species or lineage-specific in the context of regulation of individual ampcg familes, but we cannot draw general conclusion on this issue due to the limited dataset. for example, the motif aggaaa occurred only in three rodent genes of the lysozyme family, but not present in the human. ccaggg was absent in genes of the human spag <dig> family. tggcatt motif was absent in human genes of the apoa <dig> and spyy families. cccgcccc was not found in mouse genes of the apoa <dig> family . similar species-specific differences were reported for the promoter of mouse and human toll-like receptor  <dig> and its expression pattern  <cit> . since our observations were made for the region of  nucleotides  of the promoters we cannot exclude the possibility of ampcg regulation by different promoter regions in mouse and human. due to lack of sufficient data on microbial context, signaling pathways and tf binding-data on amps, it remains to be seen whether these disparities reflect an exposure to a different microbial environment or physiological differences. despite the differences in functions of ampcg families and tissue cell-specific expression, their promoters share a number of common known and new motifs . among the new motifs are ccaggg, acctgg and tctttc that did not match to any known tfbs in transfac and jasper databases. only in yeast the motif tctttc was shown to be associated in a chip experiment with cell cycle specific transcription factor spf <dig>  <cit> . whether the new motifs are cis-elements that interact with unknown or known mouse tfs remains to be established in experiments.

tf groups that are significantly associated with ampcg families
to determine tf groups that are significantly associated with ampcg families, we analyzed the tf binding motifs and the distribution of the corresponding tfs across the  <dig> ampcg families. the ampcg-associated tfs were grouped into ten tissue-specific categories  and two general categories of cell-cycle specific tfs and nuclear hormone receptors . table  <dig> and supplementary table 5a, additional file  <dig> show the distribution of motifs identified by dmb across all amp families.

for each of the ampcg family only the top two-ranked tf categories were taken into account. the ranking was based on the proportion of motifs that potentially bind tfs of a specific tf group in any ampcg family. we considered cases when tf-binding motifs associated with a particular tf group occurred in 25%, 30%, 35% or 40% of all motifs observed in the ampcg family. three tf categories  appeared to be either the first or second ranked in three out of four considered cases , and these tf categories also represent the top ranked ones, overall. the results are summarized in supplementary table 5b, additional file  <dig> 

when considering the rank position of a particular tf group in individual ampcg families, six tf categories emerge as dominant categories . these are, in order, liver-specific, neuron system-specific, adipocyte-specific, nhr, immune cell-specific and lung-specific tfs. this ranking is obtained by using the average rank position of the tf group in each of the ampcg family. the ranking of the tfs suggests that the functions of amps extend far beyond antimicrobial actions as mediators in energy metabolism and neuroendocrine regulations. the finding is reminiscent of the multi-functionality of cytokines  in adipocytes, liver and immune cells during metabolic challenges and stress  <cit> .

several groups reported on the role of dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  <cit>  and glucocorticoids  <cit>  in the transcription regulation of ampcgs. since these studies focused only on a few nhr members and few ampcg families, the appearance of nhrs in the top-ranked tf groups among many ampcg families was unexpected. nhr family proteins function as dimeric molecules in the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner  <cit> . if we require that at least 35%  of the identified motifs for each of the ampcg families can bind tfs from a particular group, nhr and neuron system specific tfs appear in eleven  out of  <dig> ampcg families. the statistical significance of nhr-related motif enrichment in this group is based on the bonferroni corrected p-value obtained from the right-sided fisher's exact test  with the null-hypothesis that there is no enrichment of nhr. the second to fourth ranked groups include liver-specific tfs , adipocyte-specific tfs  and immune cell-specific tfs .

our computational study identified vdr as a potential controller of ampcgs, but implied also other known, as well as new nhr candidates . the computational methods we used produced a broader spectrum of amp-regulating candidates than gene expression assays  <cit> . therefore our study suggests that the influence of nhrs extends across multiple ampcg families and beyond those already reported .

other tfs and their potential role in amps
we also found several tfs that were frequently associated with genes of the  <dig> ampcg families . the binding motif for sp <dig>  an ubiquitous tf is enriched in the numerous gc-rich housekeeping gene promoters, but also contributes to tissue-specific transcription. for example, the sp <dig> motif was detected in the promoters and enhancers of genes expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells where it appears to cooperate with lineage-restricted factors in directing their expression  <cit> .

meis1a and meis1b isoforms are homeoproteins related to the pre-b cell transformation protein family. meis1a is implicated in the myelopoesis  <cit>  leading to the basophil, neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes. we detected both meis1a and meis1b binding sites in members of the apoa <dig>  calgranulin, slpi, granulin, secretogranin, mbp, vip, lysozyme ampcg families, suggesting a granulocyte-specific transcriptional control function. calvo and co-workers  <cit>  showed that meis1a suppressed the g-csf-induced transcription of neutrophil differentiation-specific genes cytochrome b- <dig> beta, lactoferrin, early growth response- <dig>  neutrophil gelatinase b, and lipopolysaccharide receptor cd <dig>  the unique c-terminus of meis1a which was shown to specifically mediate protein kinase a and trichostatin activation  <cit>  provides additional support for the functional differences of meis1a and meis1b. meis1a in combination with other neutrophil-specific tfs  may play an important role in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils seen in sepsis and helicobacter pylori infection-induced iron-deficiency  <cit> . interestingly, hepcidin, which inhibits iron absorption from the small intestine during infection-induced inflammation, lacks meis <dig>  suggesting the induction of multiple alternative transcriptional regulation mechanisms during microbial pathogenesis.

promoter content of alpha-defensin, penk and zap families
for alpha-defensins, penk and zap family members we studied the predicted pes and their positional arrangements in orthologs in detail to address questions of spatial differences in expression. in case of alpha-defensins and penk, experimentally identified pes were used to assess and interpret the predictions. for the zap family promoters with scarce experimental data our computational models suggested a co-involvement of zap, nhrs and metal regulatory transcriptional control in innate immunity and oxidative stress.

alpha-defensin promoter model
alpha-defensins are specific to mammals  <cit> . gene duplication events probably led to both species-specific and functionally diverse subsets of alpha-defensins which should be also reflected in the upstream regulatory regions. for example, enteric-expressed defensins are important to the barrier function of the gut mucosal surface against bacteria, whereas myeloid and neutrophil-specific defensins help macrophages and neutrophils to kill internalized bacteria  <cit> .

we were interested to investigate how the promoter content of rat, mouse and human alpha-defensins correlates with the enteric and myeloid/neutrophil cell expression. human defa <dig>  chimpanzee defa <dig>  mouse defa <dig> and rat defa represent the myeloid-specific alpha-defensins that share the motif arrangement  in their promoter sequences . the motif arrangement 17-1- <dig> means that we found motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in this order in the examined promoters. mouse defcr <dig>  defcr <dig>  rat defcr <dig>  human and chimpanzee defa <dig> which share the motif organization 17-10- <dig> belong to the enteric-expressed group of alpha-defensins. only motif  <dig>  which contains putative binding sites for irf- <dig>  irf- <dig>  nf-at <dig>  nf-at <dig>  nf-at <dig> or nf-at <dig> transcription factors occured in both categories . whether the motif is essential for the activation of alpha-defensin expression remains to be tested experimentally.

interestingly, our comparison revealed also motif combinations that are common among myeloid and enteric defensins but largely different between rodents and primates. the rat defa and enteric-expressed mouse defcr <dig> promoter regions share the motifs  <dig>  –  <dig>  –  <dig>   arrangement . in contrast, the primate myeloid-expressed  and enteric-expressed  alpha defensins share the motif organization .

some amp families such as defensins contain members that arose by gene duplication. assuming differences in the promoter regions of recently duplicated defensins versus ancestral defensins we compared the upstream sequences  of four rat alpha defensins defcr <dig>  defa <dig>  defa <dig> and defa <dig>  the latter three defensin genes are thought to be the result of gene duplications, while defcr <dig> represents an ancestral alpha defensin  <cit> . we identified seven motifs  that were common to defa <dig>  defa <dig>  defa <dig> but not shared with defcr <dig>  on the other hand, motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were identified in all four rat promoters. fig.  <dig> and supplementary table  <dig>  additional file  <dig> show the distribution of the motifs across the rat promoter sequences and the corresponding tfbss.

penk promoter model
penka is a neuropeptide-encoding gene which is primarily expressed in tissue cells of the mature nervous and neuroendocrine systems, the epididymis and in normal and activated lymphocytes  <cit> . cleavage of penka results in the antibacterial peptide enkelytin which is active against gram-positive bacteria for example, staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . penk-derived peptides have immunomodulatory properties ranging from increased natural killer cell cytotoxicity and monocyte chemotaxis to involvement in delayed-type hypersensitivity  <cit> . our computational analysis of the promoter regions can provide some clues towards identifying pes that confer the differences in immune and nervous tissue cell-specific expression.

the penk family promoter model derived from motifs  detected in mouse rat and human promoter sequences constitutes a single, conserved motif arrangement 3-5-1- <dig> . the candidate tfs , nf-kappab, ap- <dig> , rxr-alpha, lxr-alpha, erralpha <dig> and dsf, gcn <dig>  coup-tf <dig>  rar-beta, rxr-alpha, rar-alpha <dig>  tlx, pax- <dig>   that may bind these motifs are probably necessary for expression but not sufficient to confer differential spatial expression. for instance, the expression of penk in the epididymis is regulated by testicular factors that control expression via members of the ets transcription family  <cit> . motif  <dig> contains submotifs identical to binding sites of the ets family transcription factors c-ets <dig>  elk- <dig>  sap-1a, sap-1b, pea <dig> and elf- <dig>  in analogy, motif  <dig> contains binding sites for usf family transcription factors which contribute to the transcriptional regulation of calcium-inducible neuronal genes  <cit> .

zap promoter model
the ccch-type zinc finger protein family member zap acts as an antiviral protein against sindbis and moloney murine leukemia virus  <cit> . its antiviral activity is mediated through the disruption of viral messenger rnas in the cytoplasm without affecting the levels of nuclear mrna  <cit> . the zap promoter region contains twenty motifs  including eight potential nhr binding motifs . the motif organization 1-11-15-8-10- <dig> is conserved  and potentially associated with two unknown tfs , alfin <dig>  rxr-alpha, vdr, e <dig>  e <dig>  myod, myogenin, emf <dig>  emf <dig>  emf <dig>  emf <dig>  myf- <dig>  c-myc, usf <dig>  can, e2a, dep <dig>  heb, ac, as-c t <dig>  da, sc, sn, clim <dig>  gata- <dig>  lmo <dig>  tal- <dig>  usf- <dig>  neurod, neurod, lva, pr b, ar, gr, c-ets- <dig>  ese- <dig>  helios, lyf- <dig> , nf- <dig>  tggca-binding protein , lyf- <dig>  rxr-beta, vdr  and mtf- <dig> . the presence of nf- <dig> tfbs in both penk and zap families, suggests that transcripts of these families might be induced by steroid hormones that interact with nf- <dig>  <cit> . zap expression levels in liver and kidney are high. the presence of a putative binding site for metal-regulatory transcription factor mtf- <dig>  which is also expressed in liver and kidney, suggests a regulatory role of zap in heavy metal load, oxidative stress, hypoxia and innate immunity  <cit> .

suggested future experiments
our analysis generated a number of hypotheses that are in good concordance with some of the existing knowledge in the field. however, the computationally-inferred hypotheses can only be tested in experiments. for example, microarray technology combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation  profiling  <cit>  can be used to identify all the chromosomal locations that are occupied by a transcription factor. these experiments are expected to clarify which promoters and tfs are specific for certain tissue cells and how many ampcgs are regulated by a tf, tf pairs or multiple tfs. eventually, the combination of both computational and experimental approaches should permit us to construct mechanistic models of ampcg regulatory transcription networks.

CONCLUSIONS
the large-scale computational analysis of promoters derived from  <dig> families of ampcgs across three mammalian species has allowed us to identify potential key transcription elements of these families. we have analyzed  promoter regions and it is likely that we may have missed out regulatory elements farther upstream that might be important in the fine-tuning of the regulation of particular families of ampcg. our analysis showed that tfs of the liver-, nervous system- specific and nhr groups were overrepresented in promoters of ampcg families. these tf groups consist of transcription regulators that are involved in diverse physiological functions, including the control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis, but also in immune response. interestingly, nhrs were more prominent than immune cell-specific tfs in the analyzed ampcg families. experimental evidence showed the involvement of nhrs in various immunomodulatory pathways  <cit> . however little is known about their direct involvement in innate immunity. recently, there has been evidence that vdr plays a direct role in the induction of antimicrobial innate immune response  <cit> . the results of the computational analysis which took a bird's eye view of the transcriptional regulators involved in multiple ampcg families, concur with this evidence and revealed a number nuclear hormone receptor as candidates. for example, gr, rxr-alpha, ar, vdr and t3r-alpha, seem to be involved in control of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> families respectively, out of  <dig> analyzed. in addition we discovered  <dig> new motifs as candidate tfbs with a role in antimicrobial innate immunity. the actual experimental confirmation of the ampcg transcription regulatory elements can only be accomplished by targeted research of infection or cellular stress models using time-course sampled tissue cell types.
