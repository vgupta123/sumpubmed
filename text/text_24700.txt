BACKGROUND
in humans, escherichia coli strains can be commensal  and/or the cause of various infectious diseases   <cit> . the extent of commensal or virulent properties displayed by a strain is determined by a complex balance between the status of the host and the production of virulence factors in the bacteria. the role of the intrinsic virulence of the isolates needs to be clarified and molecular markers of virulence are required to predict the invasiveness of clinical strains isolated during the course of extraintestinal infection or patient colonization.

e. coli has a clonal genetic structure and exhibits a low level of recombination  <cit> . e. coli strains can be categorised into four main phylogenetic groups, a, b <dig>  b <dig>  and d. these groups have been defined based on proteic  and genetic markers   <cit> ). seven types of esterases , differing in their ability to hydrolyse synthetic substrates and their sensitivity to di-isopropyl fluorophosphate, have been identified by separation on polyacrylamide agarose gels  <cit> . the most frequently observed type in this group of enzymes corresponds to esterase b . this protein shows two types of electrophoretic mobility: b <dig> from mf =  <dig> to mf =  <dig> and b <dig> from mf =  <dig> to mf =  <dig>  <cit> . strains with type b <dig> esterase belong to the phylogenetic group b <dig>  whereas those with type b <dig> esterase belong to the non-b <dig> phylogenetic groups  <cit> . several studies have shown a correlation between long-term evolutionary history  and virulence in e. coli, with most extraintestinal e. coli pathogens  belonging to just one of the four main e. coli phylogenetic groups, the phylogenetic group b <dig>  <cit> . this correlation suggests a possible link between esterase polymorphism and extraintestinal virulence in an asexual species with a low level of recombination. esterase b allozymes therefore appear to act as efficient molecular markers of virulence dividing e. coli strains into two genetically distinct groups, which differ significantly in their pathogenicity. however, the direct role of esterase b, or of its b <dig> and/or b <dig> allozymes, in the virulence process remains unknown.

the aims of this study were  to identify the gene encoding esterase b,  to analyse its polymorphic counterparts in relation to e. coli clonal structure,  to identify a potential physical link between this genetic locus and regions known to be associated with pathogenicity in the e. coli genome, and  to test a potential direct role of esterase b in virulence in a mouse model of extraintestinal infection.

RESULTS
the acetyl esterase gene  encodes esterase b
seven candidate genes encoding proteins with predicted esterase activity were identified, based on their respective pm and pi values, using the mage system  <cit>  . of these, aes exhibited several characteristics particularly reminiscent of esterase b: i) a major esterase domain, ii) a theoretical pi of  <dig>  for the k- <dig> strain protein  and  <dig>  for cft <dig> protein , and iii) the presence of a serine in the active site  <cit> . the inactivation of aes by gene disruption in k- <dig> mg <dig> and cft <dig> strains and complementation of the mutant strains with the aes gene confirmed that aes was esterase b .

we then studied the correlation between aes sequences and esterase b electrophoretic polymorphism. the comparison of the aes phylogenetic tree with the theoretical and observed pi values and the esterase b electrophoretic mobilities  for the  <dig> ecor strains  <cit>  is shown in fig.  <dig>  overall analysis of the tree confirmed separation of esterase b into two variants: esterase b <dig> and esterase b <dig>  indeed, the aes tree showed a clear distinction between aes from the phylogenetic group b <dig> strains and aes proteins from other strains, separated by a long branch, well supported by bootstrap . moreover, the characterisation of the phylogenetic group b <dig>  based on aes polymorphism, was consistent with the pi and mf values of esterase b <dig> , which were previously demonstrated to be specific to the phylogenetic group b <dig>  likewise, the characterisation of the phylogenetic groups a, b <dig> and d, based on aes polymorphism, correlated with the pi and mf values of esterase b <dig>   <cit> . amino-acid substitutions detected from the branches of the aes tree were analysed taking into account variation in esterase b mobility and pi values  <cit>  . in most cases, for the aes phylogenetic group b <dig> strains, substitutions of acidic to neutral, neutral to basic or acidic to basic amino acids corresponded to increases in pi  and decreases in mf values  among esterase b variants. however, there were some discrepancies. for example, the substitution of a basic amino acid in the ecor  <dig> and  <dig> strains by a neutral amino acid in the ecor  <dig> and  <dig> strains  corresponded to a faster migration in the ecor  <dig> and  <dig> strains , with no effect on pi  .

a more complex pattern of polymorphism was found among the a, b <dig> and d phylogenetic group strains. taking the most frequent esterase b electrophoretic variant  detected in the phylogenetic group a and d strains, an acidic to neutral amino-acid change  led to an increase in pi  and a decrease of mf  of the esterase b variant, as expected. this amino-acid change was detected in  <dig> strains in the phylogenetic group a . in contrast, several discrepancies were found among strains belonging to the phylogenetic b <dig> group: aes polymorphism included several substitutions of neutral to neutral amino acids but with increased pi values  and in some cases paradoxical increases of mf values  was observed . these apparent discrepancies may be due to the effects of conformational or post-translational modifications of the protein.

the phylogenetic history of aes reflects the species phylogeny
to determine the evolutionary history of aes, we tested for selection using the aes sequence from  <dig> studied strains. first, we used a one-ratio model  to estimate the average ratio Ï‰  for all sites and all lineages at  <dig> . the likelihood ratio test suggested that aes was under strong global purifying selection . the m1a, m2a, m <dig> and m <dig> models, estimating the selection on specific codons, confirmed that the vast majority  of the sites are under negative selection. finally, the branch-site model a did not detect positive selection along the branch separating group b <dig> from group non-b <dig> strains. thus, the use of several tests for selection has shown that the evolution of aes has been driven essentially by purifying selection, as observed for the housekeeping genes used in the mlst ; no positively selected site was identified for the branch separating esterase b <dig> from esterase b <dig> strains. previous studies based on whole genome sequencing data using paml have not identified aes to be under positive selection  <cit> .

visual comparison of the phylogenetic history of aes with that of the six concatenated housekeeping genes, reflecting the species phylogeny, revealed a similar topology with four main phylogenetic groups . indeed, all strains belonging to the b <dig> phylogenetic group were clustered in a monophyletic group  with ecor  <dig> at its base, as observed in the mlst tree. likewise, two sub-groups were observed for phylogenetic group d, one of which was associated with the phylogenetic group b <dig>  , also observed in the mlst tree. phylogenetic group a also constituted two sub-groups, although these were not sister groups. by contrast, the b <dig> phylogenetic group was monophyletic overall, with only two strains  clearly misclassified .

we used a recently developed technique  allowing the level of congruence between phylogenetic trees to be tested  <cit> . we tested each individual housekeeping gene tree, the mlst tree, and the aes tree. all the bootstraps are low enough  to suggest that all the gene trees can be view as not incongruent, the aes gene tree itself clustering with pabb and trpa gene trees with very low bootstrap  . thus, aes tree topology showed that aes is a powerful marker of the species phylogeny, as observed for each housekeeping gene used in the mlst scheme.

aes b <dig> and b <dig> protein variants were then compared by protein modelling. we found that residues s  <dig>  d  <dig> and h  <dig> had a geometry similar to that of the esterase catalytic site. thirty-eight polymorphic sites were identified by comparing the  <dig> aes amino-acid sequences obtained for the  <dig> ecor strains and six reference strains. for four of these sites, variation has become fixed in both b <dig> and b <dig> types, with the identified residues differing between the two types at each site. these polymorphisms could thus be used to distinguish between the types: the b <dig> conserved amino acids a  <dig>  m  <dig>  e  <dig> and c  <dig> correspond to the b <dig> conserved amino acids v, r, k and y, respectively. these four polymorphic sites were found on the long b2/non b <dig> branch in the proteic tree, explaining the observed high bootstrap  . fig.  <dig> shows the location of  <dig> additional sites at the protein surface with observed amino-acid variants for either type b <dig>  or type b <dig> . no one site was polymorphic for both b <dig> and b <dig> types. but for all the polymorphic sites within types b <dig> and b <dig>  some of the amino-acid variants are shared by the two types. consequently, these sites cannot be considered to be specific to either one type or the other and cannot be used to distinguish between the two types of protein. polymorphic sites were clustered, localised at the surface and were not found in the active site, consistent with previous observations of similarity in the catalytic activity of b <dig> and b <dig> esterases with synthetic substrates  <cit> . these differences in location of the polymorphic sites between the two variants support the divergence of the b <dig> phylogenetic group strains from the a, b <dig> and d phylogenetic groups strains within this species.

is aes involved in virulence?
the previously observed correlation between electrophoretic esterase b polymorphism and the distinction between b <dig> and non-b <dig> phylogenetic group strains  <cit>  - and thus with the extraintestinal virulence of the strains - suggested a putative role for the enzyme, or certain variants, as a virulence factor. the esterase b hydrolase function may have a direct role in the colonization or invasion of the eukaryotic cells as it was observed for esterases in other bacteria  <cit> . indeed, esterase b <dig> variants belonging to phylogenetic group b <dig> may confer higher levels of virulence to the strain during extraintestinal infection. there are several examples of proteins with variants playing different roles in extraintestinal infections: the adhesins fimh  <cit> , papg  <cit>  and the somatic antigen o  <cit> .

previous studies of aes have not demonstrated a role of the protein in virulence. firstly, experimental studies characterising aes as an enzyme with esterase activity have demonstrated the inhibitory interaction of aes with malt, a transcriptional regulator of the maltose regulon. these findings suggested a role for aes in the regulation of maltose metabolism  <cit> . aes may also play a role in the regulation of raffinose metabolism by inhibiting Î±-galactosidase  <cit> . however, these data were obtained from overexpression of aes from plasmids, thus raising the question of their relevance in vivo. an illustration of aes overexpression from the plasmid pacs <dig>  <cit>  is shown in additional file 1: fig. s <dig>  secondly, a previous study of aes expression in the k- <dig> strain in vitro did not find significant effects on expression under the various metabolic, stress or environmental conditions tested http://genexpdb.ou.edu/, with the exception of aes overexpression observed in strains cultured in the presence of acetate  <cit> . interestingly, esterase b exhibits michaelis-menten kinetics for the hydrolysis of 1-naphtyl acetate  <cit> . finally, aes expression was found to be homogeneous across  <dig> representative strains of e. coli/shigella cultured in  <dig> medium  <cit> .

our previous findings from the study of the genetic sequence surrounding aes did not suggest a role for the encoded protein in virulence. indeed, comparisons, using the mage system, of  <dig> kbp of sequence upstream and downstream from aes in the  <dig> strains of e. coli  <cit>  showed that aes is not located in/or adjacent to any regions linked to extraintestinal pathogenicity specific to b <dig> strains .

to gain insight into aes function we tested the mutants under different conditions. firstly, we studied the in vitro growth of parent-type strains and their respective mutants on several carbon sources. we did not observe any difference between parent-type strains k- <dig> or cft <dig> and their respective mutants k- <dig> Î”aes and cft <dig> Î”aes in competition studies with lb and gluconate minimum media . additionally, growth of the strains cft <dig>  k- <dig>  cft <dig> Î”aes and k- <dig> Î”aes, in the presence of different carbon sources, was the same for parent and mutant strains. these results suggested that aes does not play a role in regulation of the growth of the strains in these conditions. secondly, we studied whether aes is involved in the virulence of e. coli in vivo using a septicaemia mouse model. kaplan-meyer curves obtained for cft <dig> and its mutants cft <dig> Î”aes and cft <dig> Î”aes:cm were similar, suggesting that aes is not involved in the virulence process  .

CONCLUSIONS
selection tests and phylogenetic analyses indicate that aes is under purifying selection, showing a similar evolutionary history to that of the species. the differences in electrophoretic properties between the variant types b <dig> and b <dig> were consistent with analyses of the amino-acid sequence tree for aes and protein structure models obtained for these variants. these findings illustrated the marked divergence of the b <dig> phylogenetic group from the a, b <dig> and d phylogenetic groups in this species. this confirms the classical characteristics of esterases as excellent markers in the study of population genetics for prokaryotes, particularly enterobacteriaceae  <cit> , and eukaryotes such as drosophila spp  <cit> . findings from an in vivo experimental model of septicaemia did not show direct involvement of aes in extraintestinal virulence. moreover, we did not find any virulence-associated genes in the chromosomal region surrounding aes. thus, esterase b does not appear to play a direct role as a virulence factor in e. coli extraintestinal infection, but may serve as an informative marker of phylogeny.
