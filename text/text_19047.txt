BACKGROUND
respiratory metabolism generates reactive oxygen species  that can damage many cellular components such as dna, proteins and lipids  <cit> . these ros include such molecules as superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide, which can be produced as by-products of aerobic metabolism, oxidoreductase enzymes and metal-catalyzed oxidations. hydrogen peroxide, while relatively stable, can react with fe2+ via the fenton reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . ros also play a role in cell signaling, where they can be involved in apoptotic processes, transcriptional activation or suppression programs, and cell signaling cascades  <cit> . an increasing number of human diseases are associated with the damage that ros cause, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, hypertension and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . oxidative damage is also considered a major factor in the mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases such as parkinson’s and alzheimer’s  <cit> .

there are two modes of action that cells can use to combat the deleterious effects of ros on cellular constituents: ros prevention and dna repair. the first includes molecules that inactivate or inhibit the formation of ros, thus preventing damage from occurring in the cell. such detoxification molecules include enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase  <cit> , metabolites such as beta-carotene, lycopene and vitamins a, c and e, and minerals such as selenium and manganese  <cit> . these systems either prevent ros from forming or scavenge them before they can cause damage to vital components of the cell. the second means of defense against ros involves dna repair enzymes that correct chromosomal damage caused by ros if they are not inactivated  <cit> . these enzymes are primarily components of the base excision repair  pathways in both escherichia coli and higher eukaryotes, though nucleotide excision repair , mismatch repair , and strand break repair mechanisms are also involved in repair of oxidative damage  <cit> .

the 8-oxog modified base is a frequent oxidation product of guanine that is used as a biomarker of oxidative dna damage  <cit> . in e. coli, 8-oxog pairs with adenine during replication, resulting in a g→t transversion if the lesion is not repaired. the mutm glycosylase  functions to remove 8-oxog from dna, whereas the muty protein removes the adenine opposite 8-oxog, giving more time for mutm to work prior to replication  <cit> . nth  and nei  are two other glycosylases that act principally on the damaged pyrimidines  <cit> . e. coli mutants in most of these genes, either confer sensitivity to exogenous peroxide treatment, and/or display a spontaneous mutator phenotype as a result of their inability to repair spontaneous oxidative damage. mammalian homologs of these glycosylases have also been described and are an area of intense study  <cit> .

in a previous study using a human cdna library to identify eukaryotic genes that either prevent or repair oxidative damage, the oxr <dig> gene was identified by its ability to suppress the spontaneous mutator phenotype of an e. coli nth muth strain  <cit> . the oxr <dig> function is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but is not found in prokaryotes. a deletion of the oxr <dig> gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae causes an increase in sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide  <cit> , and removal of a locus encoding all seven isoforms in drosophila melanogaster results in lethality due to a defect in eclosion   <cit> . silencing of oxr <dig> mrna by 83% sensitized mosquitoes to the harmful effects of hydrogen peroxide in their drinking water. interestingly, the silencing of oxr <dig> also resulted in decreased mrna levels for both catalase and glutathione peroxidase, suggesting that  oxr <dig> may have a regulatory role in resistance to ros  <cit> . a study examining the expression of oxr <dig> in the mouse retinal cells after exposure to high levels of oxygen showed that oxr <dig> expression was increased by 3 days exposure, when photocells were resistant to hyperoxia and remained high in the strain that was resistant to hyperoxia. in the sensitive strain of mice, oxr <dig> levels declined in the retina and the photocells started to degenerate  <cit> . transgenic mice expressing the human apoe-ϵ <dig> isoform of apolipoprotein apoe have been characterized as exhibiting structural and functional abnormalities in their mitochondria  <cit> . a recent proteomic analysis of hippocampal cells from these mice identified oxr <dig> as one of the mitochondrial targeted gene products specifically downregulated following an ischemic insult  <cit> . by contrast, the hippocampus cells from mice transgenic for apoe-ϵ <dig> did not show mitochondrial abnormalities and did not exhibit a reduction for oxr <dig> transcripts following ischemic insult.

a recent report shows that the bella mouse , identified in a screen for mouse models of human movement disorders, lacks the oxr <dig> gene. these mice develop normally for 2 weeks following birth, but soon thereafter develop severe ataxia, do not show normal weight gain, and die within a month  <cit> . the pathological properties of the bel mutant mouse were reversed by an oxr <dig> transgene, confirming that loss of oxr <dig> was responsible for these neurological defects. histological analyses of these mice show increased cell death in the granular cell  layer of the cerebellum. these authors also report that oxr <dig> is overexpressed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  patients and in mouse models of als, indicating a possible protective function of oxr <dig> in this neurodegenerative disorder. both the human and yeast oxr <dig> genes are induced by heat and oxidative stress, and their proteins localize to the mitochondria  <cit> . localization of the oxr <dig> protein to mitochondria is significant since this organelle represents a major source of ros production in the cell.

a bacterial papillation assay for oxr <dig> activity has been previously described  <cit> . it utilizes a strain containing the lacz cc <dig> allele  <cit>  in an e. coli mutm muty strain  <cit> . in this background, the lacz cc <dig> mutation spontaneously reverts at high frequency to wild type by a gc→ ta transversion . overexpression of mutm alone completely eliminates gc→ta transversions in this strain, indicating they are primarily due to lesions repaired by the mutm glycosylase, predominantly  <dig> oxog  <cit> . thus, by growth of colonies on minimal lactose plates containing xgal and iptg, isolated colonies show high levels of lac + papillae. the expression of oxr <dig> suppresses oxidative damage, which can be easily detected by a lower frequency of papillation in this genetic background. in this study, we use this papillation assay to identify which region of the oxr <dig> protein is important for this suppressive function. surprisingly, we find that the highly conserved tldc domain, found in the extreme c-terminal region of most of the oxr <dig> isoforms, is not required for suppression of mutagenic activity in e. coli. instead, the oxidation resistance function is located in a region of oxr <dig> encoded by exon  <dig>  in a segment of the gene that encodes a putative helix-turn-helix structural motif.

RESULTS
numbering of the oxr <dig> protein
the original oxr1-producing plasmid pmv <dig> was identified from a library of human cdnas cloned into pse <dig>  <cit> . in this construct, the oxr <dig> dna sequence starts with codon  <dig> of exon  <dig>  and includes all downstream exons through exon  <dig>  with the exception of exon  <dig>  the start site for oxr <dig> protein expression from pmv <dig> is most likely the downstream atg codon within exon  <dig> at position  <dig> . this proposed n-terminal end for oxr <dig> encoded by pmv <dig> is based on the following observations. first, there is an atg site in the vector  that is a potential translational start site for oxr <dig>  there is an atg site in the vector  that is a potential translational start site for oxr <dig>  if used, it would generate an oxr <dig> protein that has an additional  <dig> amino acids  fused to the n-terminus of oxr <dig>  however, removal of this putative start site  did not affect the size of the oxr <dig> protein produced relative to that by encoded by pmv <dig> . this result strongly suggests that the atg sequence within the vector is not the start site for oxr <dig> translation in pmv <dig>  secondly, the vector-encoded start codon in pmv <dig> is preceded by an in-frame stop codon  <dig> base pairs upstream and does not have a correctly positioned ribosome binding site preceding it, making it an unlikely start site for translation. finally, when a construct is made that places an atg start site in front of codon  <dig> of exon  <dig> , an oxr <dig> product of larger size  is observed .

these results strongly suggest that oxr <dig> made from pmv <dig> starts downstream of the lysine at codon position  <dig> of exon  <dig>  thus, the methionine encoded at position  <dig> of oxr <dig> exon  <dig> is designated as the first amino acid residue of “full length” oxr <dig> protein produced from pmv <dig> . this full-length designation is only in respect to the region of oxr <dig> that is responsible for the anti-oxidant activity identified by the papillation assay in these experiments. splice variants that carry exons not examined here  may have additional functions, some of which may or may not be involved in oxidative repair. all exons listed in figure  <dig>  except the first  <dig> codons of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  are found in the pmv <dig>  exon  <dig> is used as an alternative starting point for a splice variant that includes exons  <dig> and  <dig> through  <dig>  which has no detectable oxidation antimutator activity .

oxr <dig> n-terminal deletions
a series of plasmids containing n-terminal deletions of the oxr <dig> gene was transformed into strain mv <dig>  and tested for suppression of g→t transversions using the papillation assay described above. in these constructs, oxr <dig> is driven by pmac, an artificial promoter designed to express genes under the control of iptg . the plasmids also encode the laci repressor. as seen in figure 2b, plasmids pmv <dig> and pmv <dig> that overexpress full-length oxr <dig> protein show a reduced plating efficiency upon induction, indicating they are toxic to e. coli in the presence of 1 mm iptg. . a reduced plating efficiency was also observed for iptg induction of cells containing pmv <dig>  which is missing all of exon  <dig>  and produces an oxr <dig> n-terminal truncation starting with exon  <dig> sequences. however, suppression of papillation is still observed among the colonies that do survive containing these three plasmids. on the contrary, oxr <dig> constructs starting with exons  <dig> or  <dig>  are not toxic to e. coli upon iptg induction and were unable to suppress the papillation phenotype. these results suggest that exon  <dig> is important for the mutagenic suppressor activity of oxr <dig>  and/or the stability of the oxr <dig> protein.

as is apparent in figure 2b, constructs pmv <dig>  pmv <dig> and pmv <dig> all show decreased colony forming ability relative to the non-suppressing plasmids in the presence of iptg. this effect is observed despite the fact that these plasmids encode the laci repressor. the ability of these plasmids to suppress the mutagenic phenotype of mv <dig> may be due to the lower viability  due to overexpression of a toxic protein. to control the amount of oxr <dig> deletion fragments produced in vivo, strain mv <dig> containing these plasmids were transformed with a compatible plasmid overexpressing the laci repressor , resulting in higher levels of laci repressor being present . as shown in figure 2c, this increase in laci repressor protein expression in vivo had the effect of eliminating the toxicity effect of these plasmids when plated in the presence of 1 mm iptg, without eliminating the suppressive effects of oxr <dig> expression on papillation . the papillation assay in this background shows that a construct expressing oxr <dig> starting at exon  <dig>  suppresses the mutagenic phenotype of mv <dig> without causing toxicity. as before, constructs starting at exons  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> did not exhibit any suppressor activity.

the lack of papillation suppression by the oxr <dig> fragment encoded by pmv <dig>  pmv <dig>  and pmv <dig>  might be due to differential expression of the oxr <dig> deletion mutant proteins. thus, extracts of cells containing these constructs were run on sds-page. as seen in figure 2d, one observes a decrease in oxr <dig> fragment production upon loss of exon  <dig> , suggesting the importance of the protein domain encoded by exon  <dig> in oxr <dig> stability in e. coli. while the decrease in protein production seen with oxr <dig> probably explains the loss of toxicity observed with pmv <dig> in figure 2b, we do not believe that this decrease in protein level can explain the inability of oxr <dig>  to suppress papillation. this conclusion is based on the observation that similar levels of protein are seen in extracts of cells expressing full length oxr <dig> from pmv <dig>  and the oxr <dig> fragment from plasmid pmv <dig> . thus, enough oxr fragment is present in cells containing pmv <dig> that if it did contain oxr1’s oxidation resistance activity, it would suppress the mutagenic phenotype of mv <dig> host cells. plasmid pmv <dig> produces an oxr <dig> fragment starting at exon  <dig> and encodes a stable protein but is unable to suppress papillation, while a construct encoding an oxr <dig> fragment starting at exon  <dig>  did not produce a stable protein . finally, a construct expressing only exons 13- <dig>  also did not show suppression of papillation activity, although it did show a stable protein fragment when extracts were run on sds-page . overall, these results show that exons 9– <dig> are not required for the oxidation resistance activity exhibited by full length oxr <dig>  this result was a little surprising, as this region of oxr <dig> shows the highest homology among comparisons to other oxr <dig> variants  <cit>  and contains a conserved protein domain found in a number of eukaryotic proteins with nuclear function - the tldc domain  <cit> .

one other interesting feature is apparent in the results shown in figure 2c. under these conditions of limited expression of these oxr <dig> constructs, the plasmid pmv <dig> did not exhibit suppressor activity, even though a plasmid missing an additional  <dig> residues  did show suppressor activity. this result is not due to a mutation in pmv <dig>  as sequencing of the promoter and oxr <dig> region of this construct did not reveal any differences relative to the wild type sequences. furthermore, this differential suppression is not due to different levels of expression of the oxr <dig> fragments in these constructs, as both pmv <dig> and pmv <dig> show similar levels of protein expression on sds-page gels . one possibility for this observation is that the last  <dig> amino acid residues encoded by exon  <dig> may contain a control segment for oxr <dig> activity, which when exposed by removal of exon  <dig> residues 203– <dig>  results in inhibition of the suppressor activity encoded within exon  <dig>  note however, that this inhibition can be relieved by further overexpression of this particular construct . further biochemical and mutational analysis of oxr <dig> activity within this region will be needed to verify this hypothesis. in addition, this result demonstrates that overproduction of a foreign protein does not in itself induce suppression of the mutagenic phenotype of mv <dig> 

c-terminal deletions of oxr1
carboxy-terminal deletions of oxr <dig> were constructed to identify what distal exons of oxr <dig> are important for activity and/or stability of the protein. these plasmids are controlled by the iptg-inducible ptrc promoter; the oxr <dig> sequence starts at position  <dig> in exon  <dig> in all the constructs. as described previously, translation from these plasmids most likely initiates with the methionine at position  <dig> of exon  <dig>  the c-terminal encoding endpoints in these plasmids are found at various points between exons  <dig> and  <dig> . after transformation into mv <dig> containing the laci-producing plasmid pms <dig>  the ability of these constructs to suppress mutagenesis was assessed by the papillation assay.

as can be seen in figure 3b, all four of the oxr <dig> c-terminal deletions were capable of suppressing papillation when plated in the presence of  <dig>  mm iptg. at  <dig>  mm iptg, overexpression of these oxr <dig> fragments caused toxicity. interestingly, overexpression of these oxr <dig> fragments with 1 mm iptg prevented suppression when high amounts of cells were plated, but still showed suppression of papillation when single colonies were examined . this effect was not observed when toxic levels of the n-terminal fragments were plated . , is likely the result of the higher transcriptional activity of the ptrc promoter relative to pmac.) thus, removal of oxr <dig> exons 13– <dig>  had no effect on the ability of these fragments to suppress papillation , consistent with the results from the n-terminal deletion constructs described above.

extracts of mv4709/pms <dig> cells expressing these fragments were run on sds-page to examine the level of proteins produced. as seen in figure 3c , a doublet band is observed for the full length oxr <dig> expressed from pmv <dig>  given the close spacing of these bands, the difference in size between them is likely to be about 1–2 kda. the doublet band of oxr <dig> is also observed in a second full-length oxr <dig> construct that promotes higher levels of protein  and with all four of the oxr <dig> c-terminal deletion constructs . thus, the most likely explanations for the oxr <dig> doublet is either  a second restart site at the gtg site  <dig> codons downstream of the atg start site, or  in vivo degradation of 10– <dig> amino acids from the n-terminus. a construct that initiates from a start codon placed at the beginning of exon  <dig> encodes a single discrete species . thus, if the doublet is due to partial degradation, it is limited to sequences encoded within the last  <dig> residues of exon  <dig> 

internal deletions of oxr <dig> fragment containing oxr <dig> exons 8–13
plasmid pmv <dig> encodes oxr <dig> exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> driven by the pmac promoter . a high level of expression of the oxr <dig> fragment was observed from extracts of iptg-induced cells containing this plasmid . overexpression of this oxr <dig> fragment from this construct was toxic . to down-regulate the expression of the oxr <dig> fragment encoded by pmv <dig>  rrnb t <dig> and t <dig> terminators were removed by digestion with saci and xbai, filling-in with t <dig> dna polymerase and dntps, and religating. the resulting plasmid  showed lower amounts of the oxr <dig> fragment relative to pmv <dig> as seen on sds-page . it is presumed that removal of the terminator sequences from the plasmid destabilized the resulting transcript. plasmid pmv <dig> expresses exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and thirty-nine out of the fifty-one residues encoded by exon  <dig>  it suppresses the mutator phenotype of mv4709/pms <dig>  when single colonies are examined; see figure 4b. when the oxr <dig> fragment from pmv <dig> is expressed in mv4709/pms <dig>  a protein band is observed on sds-page consistent with the expected size of the oxr <dig> fragment encoded by these exons .

a series of plasmids containing in-frame internal deletions of pmv <dig> were constructed and tested for their ability to suppress the papillation of mv4709/pms <dig>  plasmid pmv <dig> contains an internal deletion that removes most of exons  <dig> and  <dig>  this plasmid did not produce a stable band on sds-page, and not surprisingly, did not suppress papillation . this result suggests that this region of the protein is important for stability of the oxr <dig>  fragment, as noted above for the n-terminal deletion plasmid pmv <dig>  plasmid pmv <dig>  which is missing the latter half of exon  <dig>  exons  <dig> and  <dig>  did suppress papillation and showed a band on sds-page consistent with the size of the expected fragment . in fact, the suppression exhibited by pmv <dig> was more efficient than that seen with pmv <dig>  which contains exons 8– <dig> . in this case, papillation suppression was noted when high numbers of cells were plated . the only intact exon in pmv <dig> is exon  <dig>  showing again that this domain encodes the active suppressor function. finally, a plasmid that contains exons 8– <dig> but is missing all but the first  <dig> residues of exon  <dig> , still suppressed papillation within single colonies, but to a lesser extent than pmv <dig> ; see figure 4c, compare lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  see arrow). the most likely explanation for this observation is that a stability determinant of this protein is present in exon  <dig> and that its presence in pmv <dig> stabilizes exon  <dig>  enhancing its activity.

internal deletions of full-length oxr <dig> 
given the above results suggesting that exon  <dig> encodes the anti-oxidant activity of oxr <dig>  a robson-garnier analysis  <cit>  of the protein secondary structural features of the protein fragment encoded by exon  <dig> was performed . highlighted in this analysis is a potential helix-turn-helix segment encoded by residues 9– <dig> a, and a second  helix-turn-helix segment encoded by residues 38– <dig>  understanding that protein secondary structural prediction programs are not definitive, we used these predictions as a guide to generate a second set of internal deletions of oxr <dig>  this time starting with the full length construct . plasmids were constructed that removed each of these regions separately  and together , as well as deletions in the latter part of exons  <dig> and  <dig> . papillation and sds-page analyses of these constructs are shown in figure 6b and 6c, respectively.

a plasmid  that encodes a protein that is missing both predicted helix-turn-helix structural features failed to suppress papillation on plates containing either  <dig>  or  <dig>  mm iptg . this result is due to the lack of significant protein production seen with this construct , again arguing for the presence of a major stability determinant encoded by exon  <dig>  a plasmid  that encodes an oxr <dig> protein that contains the first  predicted helix-turn-helix encoded by exon  <dig>  but not the second one, was fully capable of papillation suppression at  <dig>  mm iptg . the construct also exhibited inhibition of cell growth at higher concentrations of iptg, as observed with the full length oxr <dig> protein. a plasmid construct  missing the first predicted helix-turn-helix feature, but containing the second one, was also tested. this construct was not able to inhibit papillation at  <dig>  mm iptg, but did so in the presence of higher amounts of iptg . sds-page analysis of extracts of these cells  shows that this effect could largely be attributed to the differences in stable protein production from plasmids pkm <dig> and pkm <dig> , making it hard to assign the supression of mutagenesis function to principally one or the other region in exon  <dig>  nonetheless, these results show that either predicted helix-turn helix region of exon  <dig> is sufficient to prevent oxidative damage. in addition, the first predicted helix-turn-helix region of exon  <dig> encodes the major stability determinant of the oxr <dig> protein. finally, a plasmid construct encoding oxr <dig> deleted of the latter part of exon  <dig> and the beginning of exon  <dig> , and a plasmid expressing oxr <dig> deleted of a predicted helix in exon  <dig> , both formed stable proteins that were fully capable of papillation suppression at  <dig>  mm iptg . these results are in agreement with those discussed above for n-terminal deletion mutants that exon  <dig> is not involved in oxidative damage protection.

2a summary of these experiments is shown in table  <dig>  it is evident that all the constructs that express a stable form of oxr <dig> containing exon  <dig> are fully  capable of suppressing the oxidative mutator effect exhibited by the tester strain, mv <dig> . all other deletions have neither an effect on toxicity  nor the capability to suppress papillation. thus, exon  <dig> encodes the peptide sequences required for the oxidative mutagenesis suppression activity of the human oxr <dig> protein. finally, we note that the exon 8-encoded protein sequence contains a cysteine residue at position  <dig>  that might be a reactive residue involved in oxidative damage repair. we tested this prediction by altering cys- <dig> of exon  <dig> to alanine in plasmid pmv <dig>  however, the c18a mutant was as capable as the wild type oxr <dig> sequence for suppression of papillation, ruling out a role for this cysteine residue in oxidative damage repair or prevention.

quantitative analysis of oxr <dig> mutation suppression
the papillation assay is very sensitive for detection of the mutagenic suppression activity of oxr <dig>  nonetheless, we preformed a more quantitative analysis on some of the oxr <dig> fragment-producing constructs described above. lac+ reversion frequencies of mv <dig>  were determined by growing cells overnight and plating on m <dig> minimal plates containing lactose as the sole carbon source . in the absence of oxr <dig>  mv <dig> generated over  <dig> lac+ revertants per  <dig> cells plated . expression of an oxr <dig> fragment, starting with sequences encoded by exon  <dig> , fully suppressed lac+ reversion frequencies of mv <dig> by  <dig> %, down to levels exhibited by wild type e. coli . plasmid pkm <dig>  which encodes an oxr <dig> derivative that is largely deleted of exon  <dig>  did not suppress the mutagenic activity of mv <dig>  consistent with the papillation assay. in large part, this result is likely due to the inability of this construct to produce a stable protein . plasmid pkm <dig>  deleted of exon  <dig> sequences encoding residues 9– <dig>  also showed no suppression of mutagenic activity in the lac+ reversion assay. this result differs from the papillation assay, where growth of cells containing pkm <dig>  did suppress papillation to a degree . these different results for pkm <dig> can be ascribed to either the greater sensitivity of the papillation assay in measuring mutagenesis, or to differences in the residual activity of this oxr <dig> deletion mutant when grown in liquid culture  versus m <dig> minimal plates. plasmid pkm <dig>  however, deleted of sequences encoding residues 37– <dig> of exon  <dig>  inhibited mutagenesis by 97%  consistent with the results of the papillation assay described above.

two other plasmids were also examined in the lac+ reversion assay. both pmv <dig>  and pmv <dig> , which both showed high levels of suppression using the paplliation assay, also showed inhibition of mutagenesis in the lac+ reversion assay to 84% and 69%, respectively, of the level exhibited by mv <dig> containing the control plasmid. again, the lack of full suppression with these plasmids using the lac+ reversion assay can be attributed to the greater sensitivity of the papillation assay, or to differences in oxr <dig> activity of these mutants when grown in liquid culture versus solid media. overall, however, the results of the papillation assays and the lac + reversion frequencies are in good agreement; that is, that exon 8-encoded residues 9– <dig> play a critical role in the mutagenic suppression capability of the human oxr <dig> protein.

discussion
these results show that oxr <dig> amino acids 9– <dig> of exon  <dig> is a key region responsible for the oxidative antimutator activity of oxr <dig>  this region is also an important stability determinant of the oxr <dig> protein expression in e. coli. while it might be concluded that this region is simply required for stability of oxr <dig>  with the repair function encoded by a different region of oxr <dig>  this supposition is not supported by consideration of results from all the deletion mutants. for instance, the analyses of the c-terminal deletion mutants shown in figure  <dig> reveal that exons 13– <dig> are not required for the anti-oxidation activity exhibited by full length oxr <dig>  this result was a little surprising, as this region of oxr <dig> shows the highest homology among comparisons to other oxr <dig> variants  <cit>  and contains a conserved protein domain found in a number of eukaryotic proteins with nuclear function - the tldc domain  <cit> . sequences present in exon  <dig> can also be ruled out as important for oxr <dig> activity, as plasmid pmv <dig> expresses a stable protein , but does not suppress papillation . most revealing however, is the result for plasmid pmv <dig>  which contains exon  <dig> as the only intact exon of oxr <dig> and is completely capable of suppressing papillation . taken together, the results reported here suggest that exon  <dig>  especially the region encoding a large predicted helix-turn-helix region, is the key determinant for the oxidation resistance function of the oxr <dig> protein.

the human gene ncoa <dig> encodes a protein that associates with the estrogen receptor, is targeted to the nucleus, and is highly homologous to oxr <dig>  <cit> . the gene is expressed in a variety of tissues, but is most highly expressed in neurons. it has been proposed that ncoa <dig>  by binding to the estrogen receptor, might alleviate the oxidative damage that results from estradiol metabolism  <cit> . other enzymes involved in the repair of dna damage have also been identified that bind to the estrogen receptor  <cit>  and may play a similar role in protecting dna from oxidative damage. durand et al. <cit>  showed that c-terminal fragments of ncoa <dig> containing the tldc domain were capable of oxidative damage repair in e. coli. of note, however, is that the fragment of ncoa <dig> used in that assay also contained most of exon  <dig>  the exon homologous to oxr <dig> exon  <dig> examined in this report. an alignment of these two exons is shown in figure 5b. the c-terminal fragment of ncoa <dig> that was competent for oxidative repair in e. coli started with the methionine at position  <dig> of exon  <dig>  at this position, the c-terminal fragment of ncoa <dig> contains the regions most homologous to oxr <dig> exon  <dig>  the exon described here as being critical for oxr <dig> oxidative damage suppression. although not part of the tldc domain  a comparison of oxr <dig> sequences from a variety of organisms shows that exon  <dig> is highly conserved, especially among higher eukaryotes.

oxr <dig> and its close homolog ncoa <dig> are produced in many different forms either as a result of alternative splicing, or alternative transcription start sites. most of these isoforms include exon  <dig> of oxr <dig>  or its counterpart  of ncoa <dig>  indicating that their antioxidant functions are key features of the gene products. however, there are several isoforms that include only the c-terminal tldc domain that lack exon  <dig>  the best characterized of these isoforms is the oxr <dig> c7c variant originally described by fischer et al. <cit>  and its human counterpart. this variant includes oxr <dig> exon  <dig>  which is not found in other variants of oxr <dig>  the human form of this variant of oxr <dig> lacks antioxidant activity, as no suppression of oxidative mutagenesis is seen when this protein is highly expressed in the e. coli mutm muty strain . this result eliminates the possibility that exon  <dig> can replace the oxidation resistance function of exon  <dig>  these results suggest that in addition to the conserved oxidation resistance function, these highly conserved proteins may have additional functions that have not been characterized and that this hypothetical function is contained within the highly conserved c-terminal tldc domain.

oliver et al. <cit>  have recently reported that loss of mouse oxr <dig>  resulted in the onset of an ataxia phenotype two weeks after birth in bel mice, followed by death within the first month of life. the authors found that the cerebellar granual cell layer  of these mice were sensitive to hydrogen peroxide more than normal controls, an effect that could be reversed by lentiviral expression of an oxr <dig> transgene. notably, using a gene-trap construct, they found that in vivo expression of the c-terminal region of moxr <dig> , which corresponds to exons 12– <dig> of hoxr <dig>  was capable of reversing the neurological phenotype and early death of bel mouse mutant. in addition, they show that moxr1-c expression could protect both wild-type and bel mutant gcl cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. on the contrary, we find that the c-terminal region of the hoxr <dig> was neither necessary or sufficient for suppression of oxidative damage in e. coli, and instead, that the function required for the antimutator phenotype resides in exon  <dig>  which is present in both full-length and intermediate splice variants of hoxr <dig> 

combining the results of both studies, a model emerges regarding the different functional characteristics of the mammalian oxr <dig> protein. the tldc domain in the c-terminus of moxr <dig> is clearly required for a key function of oxr <dig> that protects cells from oxidative damage, as shown by the study of oliver et al. <cit> . these authors go on to show that the moxr1-c domain can interact with h2o <dig> via oxidation of a reactive cysteine , suggesting that oxr1’s oxidative antimutator function may be the result of a direct interaction between the protein and reactive oxygen species. however, as the authors noted, the rate constant for this reaction was thousands of times lower relative to antioxidants that work in this manner , leading them to suspect that the tldc domain of moxr <dig> has another type of function, or perhaps operates in a regulatory capacity. a regulatory role of oxr <dig> has been suggested by jaramillo-gutierrez et al. <cit>  who showed that silencing of oxr <dig> in mosquitoes resulted in lower levels of transcripts coding for enzymes such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, proteins that act directly in detoxification of ros. in this study, using our e. coli assay, we find that an oxidative antimutator function is not found in the hoxr <dig> c-terminal region, leading to the greater likelihood that this domain may instead have regulatory role, perhaps after an interaction with certain types of reactive oxygen species. along these lines, the dispensability of the hoxr <dig> c-terminal region in our e. coli assay is not unexpected if the tldc domain’s principal role in mammalian cells is to regulate antioxidative operons, an effect not likely reproducible in e. coli.

we favor a model of hoxr <dig> where an antioxidant activity is encoded by exon  <dig>  with the c-terminal domain conferring a regulatory region that responds to ros. at least in e. coli, the proposed c-terminal regulatory region is not required for antioxidant function. splice variants that include full length or intermediate species of hoxr <dig> may then reflect the need for both antioxidant activity and antioxidant-regulatory functions, whereas in tissues where only the short c-terminal region of hoxr <dig> is present may require only the regulatory feature of the oxr <dig> protein to protect from ros. the study by oliver et al. <cit>  showed that the shorter moxr1-c form is present in the brain at low levels, though it is as highly expressed in the cerebellum as full length moxr <dig>  such differences may reflect the need for regulatory capabilities of moxr <dig> more so in the cerebellum than in the rest of the brain, where both an oxidative antimutator function and a regulatory region are required. as mentioned in the introduction, these authors also reported an upregulation of intermediate forms of oxr <dig> in als human biopsy samples, as well as in sod <dig> mutant mice . the intermediate forms of oxr <dig> contain the upstream oxidative antimutator function we have identified here in exon  <dig> and may reflect the need for this activity as a protective function in als patients. it would be interesting to know if mutations in the hoxr <dig> gene also play a role in sporadic cases of als.

what does oxr <dig> the exon 8-encoding function do? the region of exon  <dig> required for oxidation resistance shares homology only with other members of the oxr family of proteins suggesting they have a unique function not shared with other proteins that contribute to oxidative stress resistance. however, it has been observed that oxr <dig> can suppress mutagenesis in bacteria, indicating it does not require additional human proteins for function and can suppress mutagenesis resulting from mutations in genes inactivating several different types of oxidative lesions  <cit> . these results make it more likely that oxr <dig> exon 8-encoded region prevents rather than repairs oxidative damage, since oxidative damage repair enzymes typically recognize only a single, or a set of structurally similar lesions. such a role for oxr <dig> as an antioxidant protein is further supported by studies of oxr <dig> deletion mutants of yeast, which exhibit elevated levels or ros, suggesting its function is to reduce ros levels .

CONCLUSIONS
the human oxr <dig> gene exon  <dig> encodes a function required for the suppression of oxidative damage. this oxidative resistance function is distinct from the highly conserved tldc domain found in the c-terminal region of oxr <dig>  a model is proposed that oxr <dig> consist of two separable functions involved in oxidative resistance: a c-terminal domain that has a regulatory role in inducing oxidative resistance functions in response to oxidative damage, and an internal region of the protein encoded by exon  <dig> that possesses a antimutator “protective” function against reactive oxygen species.
