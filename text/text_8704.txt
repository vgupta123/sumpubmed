BACKGROUND
phytic acid and phytates exist widely in edible legumes, cereals, oil seeds, pollens and nuts, and account for about 1 − 5% of the dry weight of plant seeds  <cit> . the presence of phytic acid and phytates in plant food and feed has been well documented  <cit> . they are a primary source of inositol and an important storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds that are often used as animal feed ingredients  <cit> . because of their ability to interact with biomolecules, such as proteins and carbohydrates, they can act as anti-nutritional factors in several ways:  chelating cations, such as ca2+, mg2+, fe2+ and zn2+, to form insoluble metal phytate complexes under gastrointestinal ph conditions;  reducing the digestibility of protein, starch and lipids; and  inhibiting the activity of enzymes, including amylase, trypsin, acidic phosphatase and tyrosinase  <cit> . thus, it is necessary to remove phytic acid and phytates in food and feed processing to avoid the above-mentioned problems.

phytase  cleaves phosphor- monoester bonds in phytic acid and phytates. this results in the sequential release of a series of lower phosphate esters of myoinositol and orthophosphate. therefore, phytase has gained rapid acceptance as an animal feed or a food additive worldwide  <cit> . in addition, phytase has important applications in ameliorating human nutrition  <cit> , as well as in some other areas, including aquaculture  <cit> . thus, it is highly desirable to reduce the content of phytic acid and phytates in food and feed processing by the hydrolysis of phytase.

a wide variety of phytases have been isolated from different organisms  <cit> . however, the focus has been on fungus-derived phytases that are active at low ph values and show low thermal stability  <cit> . moreover, although the addition of phytase is widely used to improve the release of plant phosphorus in poultry and swine, the use of phytase in feed for aquatic species has not been developed  <cit> . some aquaculture species are agastric and their digestive system ph is neutral. thus, fungus-derived acidic phytases are of limited use to these species because these phytases show low activity at neutral ph. bacterial phytases are an important alternative to fungal ones because of their high thermal stability, phytate substrate specificity, wide ph profile and proteolysis resistance  <cit> . therefore, the purification and characterization of novel phytases with high thermal stability and activity at neutral ph from bacteria is of particular interest for future industrial applications in food and feed processing.

in the present study, a novel neutral and heat-tolerant phytase from a newly isolated strain bacillus nealsonii zj <dig> from the soil was sequentially purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, deae-sepharose fast flow column chromatography and sephadex g- <dig> size-exclusion chromatography. the enzymatic properties of the purified phytase were investigated in detail.

RESULTS
purification of the phytase from b. nealsonii zj0702
the supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the culture broth at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min was used as the enzyme source. the purification of the phytase was sequentially performed by 2so <dig> precipitation, deae-sepharose anion-exchange column chromatography and sephadex g- <dig> size-exclusion column chromatography. the purification results are presented in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  after 2so <dig> precipitation, 76% of the total protein was removed. the residual protein was subject to deae-sepharose anion-exchange column chromatography , and the protein containing the activity of phytase was collected and pooled, giving 6% of the total protein. the protein was subject to further purification by sephadex g- <dig> size-exclusion chromatography. here, fractions 2– <dig> showed the highest phytase activity . these fractions were collected and pooled, giving 1% of the total protein. the purification folds of phytase from the above three purification steps were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. corresponding recovery rates of the total activity of phytase were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively . the sds-page analysis of the protein samples from the above three purification steps is shown in figure 1c. only a single protein band with an estimated molecular weight of  <dig> kda was present following the sephadex g- <dig> size-exclusion chromatography step. this result indicates that the obtained phytase is electrophoretically pure and can be used for the analysis of enzymatic properties.

homology analysis of the phytase
the homology tree of phytase based on the dna sequence is presented in figure  <dig>  a very low sequence homology was found between the dna sequence of the phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> and phytases from selected microorganisms. the determined n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> is: mgaidtcpnkystirrvlimn kktqmihggh. a similarity comparison was also carried out between this protein sequence and the corresponding regions of other known phytases; however, no similarity was found. these results strongly suggest that the phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> is different from other known phytases .

enzymatic properties of the purified phytase
enzymatic properties of the purified phytase are shown in figure  <dig>  the activity of the phytase increased when the temperature was increased from  <dig> to 50°c, and reached a maximal value at 55°c. thereafter, it decreased rapidly as the temperature increased beyond 55°c. this shows that the optimal temperature of the purified phytase is 55°c . the activity of the phytase varied as a function of the ph. the highest activity of the phytase was observed at ph <dig>  . for the phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig>  strong thermal stability was observed at  <dig> and 55°c. the activity of the phytase showed negligible change when incubated at either of these temperatures for  <dig> min. the residual activities of the phytase were  <dig>   <dig> and 41% when the protein was incubated at 80°c for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min. the residual activities of the phytase at 90°c were  <dig>   <dig> and 21% when the protein was incubated for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively . a high ph stability of the phytase was observed when it was incubated at ph <dig>  and  <dig> . at ph <dig> , the activity of the phytase decreased dramatically as the incubation time increased, and only 1% of the original activity of the phytase remained after incubation at ph <dig>  for  <dig> min .

the effect of different metal ions on the activity of the purified phytase  indicated that ca2+ at  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm did not alter its activity. in addition, the activity of the purified phytase was not altered when  <dig> mmmg2+ was added. however, the activity decreased by 38% when the concentration of mg2+ increased to  <dig> mm. cu2+, co2+, zn2+, ba2+, mn2+ and ni2+ at  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm were found to inhibit the activity of phytase significantly. the relative hydrolytic rate of different phosphorylated compounds showed that the purified phytase exhibited very narrow substrate specificity . the phytase showed high activity only towards the substrate sodium phytate. no phytase activity was detected when other phosphorylated substrates were used.

athe counter ion of these metal ions is cl−.

bcontrol samples are phytase solutions without the addition of the metal ions.

discussion
in this study, a neutral and heat-tolerate phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> was purified to homogeneity, and the homology analysis based on n-terminal amino acid sequencing and dna sequencing revealed that the phytase is novel. this enzyme display the optimal activity at 55°c, which is similar to that of other known phytases from particular microorganisms, such as mucor hiemalis , aspergillus oryzae , bacillus subtilis , escherichia coli , penicillium simplicissimum , aspergillus niger  and klebsiella terrigena   <cit> . compared with acidic phytases from saccharomyces cerevisiae , cladosporium sp. fp- <dig> , pichia anomala , candida krusei , lactobacillus sanfranciscensis , pantoea agglomerans , klebsiella terrigena  and penicillium simplicissimum   <cit> , the phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> showed the optimal activity at ph <dig> , indicating that it is neutral and should be suitable for the application in some aquaculture species whose digestive system ph is neutral. the thermal stability of the phytase suggests that it has stronger thermal stability than the phytase from yersinia kristensenii <cit> . the strong inhibition of the activity of the phytase by ba2+, cu2+ and co2+ at  <dig> mm shows that the active site of phytase may include –sh moieties. the high substrate specificity of the phytase for sodium phytate indicates that the phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> is highly specific for inositol polyphosphate.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from this study demonstrate that the phytase from b. nealsonii zj <dig> shows optimal activity at neutral ph, strong thermal stability and high substrate specificity for sodium phytate. these unique properties make this phytase an attractive alternative to replace fungus-derived phytases for the hydrolysis of phytic acid and phytates. extensive studies on the application of the purified phytase in food and feed processing are ongoing.
