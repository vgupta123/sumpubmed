BACKGROUND
the adam  family comprises membrane-spanning multi-domain proteins containing a metalloproteinase-like domain and a disintegrin-like domain. approximately half of the adams are catalytically active metalloproteases that shed a broad range of substrates, such as cytokines, growth factors, receptors, adhesion molecules  <cit> . recent gene-disruption studies in mice have disclosed a physiological role of each adam. for example, adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adam <dig> are critical for normal development by providing growth signals at the correct times and places  <cit> . in contrast, the functions of adam <dig>  adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adam <dig> are not essential for embryogenesis, suggesting a possible functional redundancy with other protease  <cit> . the remaining half, which are non-protease-adams, are thought to be adhesion molecules. more than ten adams have been shown to support integrin-mediated cell adhesion in vitro  <cit> . more recently, the finding has been reported that integrin-mediated cell migration of tissue culture cells can be controlled by distinct adams  <cit> . in c. elegans, unc- <dig> gene coding a non-protease-adam protein have been shown to be involved in cell migration events in vivo  <cit> . however, the physiological roles of mammalian non-protease-adams are poorly understood in vivo. genetic deletion studies in mice have shown that both adam2-null and adam3-null male mutants are infertile and their spermatozoa lack egg-binding abilities  <cit> . the precise mechanism is under investigation  <cit> .

we have reported the findings of adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adam <dig> genes and their restricted expression in the human and murine nervous systems  <cit> . these adams lack a catalytic motif critical for the metalloproteinase activity, suggesting that they are not proteases. we assume that these adams might contribute to cell migration, differentiation and survival or synaptic regulation by binding to integrins, cell-surface proteins or intracellular signalling molecules  <cit> . we have reported severe ataxia, seizures, and death before weaning, accompanied with hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system in adam22-null mutant mice  <cit> . it has been reported that the disruption of adam <dig> gene in the mouse results in premature death associated with ataxia and tremor  <cit> . is spite of such extreme phenotypes, no histological defects in the brain has been observed in either adam22-null nor adam23-null mice.

adam <dig> is the closest paralog of adam <dig> and adam <dig>  and its orthologs have been found in vertebrates, but not in invertebrates. it has been reported that the xenopus adam <dig> ortholog, xmdc11a, has an expression pattern associated with neural development, with a proposed role in cell migration  <cit> ; and it has been reported in analyses using northern blot and in situ hybridisation methods that the murine adam <dig> gene is expressed in both the developing and adult nervous system  <cit> . these findings led us to hypothesise that adam <dig> is an integrin binder that plays an important role in the nervous system, as do adam <dig> and adam <dig>  to determine the physiological functions of adam <dig>  we generated and analysed adam <dig> gene-targeted mice.

RESULTS
generation of adam11-deficient mice
mice carrying a targeted mutation in their adam <dig> gene were generated by homologous recombination . correct targeting events were confirmed by southern blot analysis . as a result of this procedure, since a termination codon was introduced in exon  <dig> in the pro-protein domain, only the truncated form of the adam <dig> protein would be synthesised from this targeted allele. because pro-protein domains are always removed in mature functional adam-proteins by furin-like proteases and are thus thought to be non-functional, we concluded that this truncated form of adam <dig> protein would have no function  <cit> . absence of mature adam <dig> protein in homozygous mutants was confirmed by western blot analysis using a specific antibody that recognises the adam <dig> protein . analysis by western blot showed that heterozygous mutants produced approximately half of the wild-type levels of adam <dig> protein.

adam11-deficient mice are viable and appear normal
mating of mice heterozygous for the adam <dig> mutation yielded a near-mendelian distribution of genotypes in the offspring and the ratio of females and males was the same in all groups . for the present experiments, adam11-deficient male mice  were used in all behavioural analyses and anatomical-histological studies. homozygous adam11-deficient mice were viable and appeared normal, indicating that the adam <dig> gene is not essential to development and survival. the gain in body weight of  mice was comparable to that of  and  mice at least until  <dig> weeks of age . there was no significant difference in locomotor activity among ,  and  genotypes . no apparent anatomical-histological change was observed in the spinal cord, heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, testis or ovary . the brain of  mice, including the hippocampus  and cerebellum  appeared normal after he staining when ,  and  mice were compared. since adam <dig> is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebellum, we applied hippocampus- or cerebellum-dependent behavioural analyses.

spatial learning in adam11-deficient mice
to study the functions of adam <dig> in the hippocampus, we examined the spatial learning ability of adam11-deficient mice using the morris water maze task  <cit> . first, mice were trained in a hidden platform task, in which mice searched for a submerged platform to escape from the water. adam <dig>  mice were found to take a significantly longer time to locate the hidden platform than  and  mice . nonetheless, the ability of ,  and  mice to find the hidden platform improved over test sessions . thus, ,  and  mice were able to learn the location of the hidden platform during the course of the trials, although the capacity of  mice to find the platform was lower than that of  and  mice. we further performed a probe test, in which the platform was removed from the pool after completion of the hidden platform task, and the trained mice were allowed to swim freely for  <dig> sec. the time spent in the target quadrant of  is significantly lower than that of  mice . adam <dig>  mice appeared to spend a shorter time in the target quadrant, but there was no significant difference between  and  mice . these results indicate a spatial learning impairment in  mice. the swimming distance of ,  and  mice, however, was similar during the probe trial . in the visible platform task, the performance of mice with ,  and  genotypes improved during the course of the test sessions, as indicated by a progressive decrease in the latency for locating the platform , suggesting that  mice learn this visible platform task just as well as  and  mice. these results also indicated that  mice have normal visible and motor function and the motivation needed in the water maze task.

motor function of adam11-deficient mice
to study the functions of adam <dig> in the cerebellum, we examined the motor function of adam11-deficient mice using a rotating rod task  <cit> . in the rotating rod test, the retention time of  and  mice on the rod was not significantly different from that of  mice at  <dig> rpm   . in  mice, the tendency of decreased retention times was seen at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rpm, but there was no significant difference between  and  mice  . however,  mice fell more quickly from the rod than  mice at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rpm  . the retention time was not significantly improved in  mice across trials of training at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rpm  . in a traction test,  mice showed a high grip strength similar to that of  and  mice . the hanging score and time of  mice were also similar to those of  and  mice . a footprint test did not reveal any abnormalities in walking patterns, including stride length and step width, as a function of genotypes .

discussion
in the present study, we examined the function of adam <dig> by generating mice that lacked the adam <dig> gene. it has been reported that the adam <dig> gene is expressed in the brain, heart, liver and testis, as manifested in northern blot analysis  <cit> . interestingly, adam11-deficient mice appeared normal and survived more than one year without apparent histological abnormality, including the brain, heart, liver and testis. the expression patterns of the adam <dig> gene in the brain have been studied using in situ hybridisation  <cit> . this study has shown high expression of adam <dig> mrna in the hippocampus and cerebellum. we therefore focused on examining the hippocampus- and cerebellum-dependent behavioural tests to study the functions of adam <dig> in the nervous system.

it is widely accepted that the hippocampus is involved in the performance of the hidden platform version of the water maze test, since lesions of the hippocampal pathways lead to a severe impairment of learning in this task  <cit> . in the hidden platform task, adam11-deficient mice needed more time to reach the platform than wild-type mice. spatial learning was also assessed using a probe trial, in which the platform was removed from the pool on the day following nine days of training. the wild-type mice spent significantly more time searching for the platform in the target quadrant than the other quadrants. however, adam11-deficient mice did not search selectively in the target quadrant. on the other hand, in the visible platform version, in which the motor ability and visual acuity of the mouse are tested, adam11-defieient mice were normal. these results indicated that adam11-deficient mice showed a spatial learning impairment.

the cerebellum is in charge of the smooth coordination of somatic motor activity, regulation of muscle tone, and mechanisms that influence and maintain equilibrium  <cit> . it is widely accepted that the cerebellum is involved in the performance of the rotating rod task, since mice with structural abnormalities in the cerebellum  <cit>  or with disruptions in genes enriched in the cerebellum  <cit>  exhibit performance deficits in this task. in the rotating rod test in this study, although the retention time of adam11-deficient mice on the rod was not different from wild-type mice at  <dig> rpm , adam11-deficient mice fell more quickly from the rod than wild-type mice at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rpm. these results indicate that adam11-deficient mice have a deficit in motor coordination. on the other hand, in the visual platform version of the water maze task, motor ability for swimming in adam11-deficient mice was normal. these results suggested that there might be a different mechanism of motor function between swimming and the rotating rod task. it has been also reported that the cerebellum is involved in another important distinct function: learning associated with component movement   <cit> . the retention time of synaptotagmin  iv-deficient mice on the rod was significantly shorter than wild-type mice, and they improved it approximately to the same rates as did wild-type mice during rotating rod performance  <cit> . these data suggest the basis for the performance deficit on the rotating rod task in the syt iv mutants is in motor coordination rather than in motor learning. the results in the present study showed that adam11-deficient mice slightly, though not significantly, improved motor learning ability during rotating rod performance. however, the deficit of motor learning in adam11-deficient mice was not clear in this study. because they could not ride on the rotating rod, they might not learn this task. to examine motor learning ability in adam11-deficient mice in detail, we will need to use other cerebellar-dependent learning tasks, such as a classical eyelid conditioning test. there was no impairment in the grip strength and wire suspension test in adam11-deficient mice. spontaneous motor activity and walking patterns of adam11-deficient mice were also found to be normal, suggesting that the dysfunction found in the rotating rod test was not derived from muscle weakness or other peripheral disturbances.

these results suggest that limited brain sites, mainly the hippocampus and cerebellum, might contribute to the dominant phenotype, spatial learning impairment and motor discoordination in adam11-deficient mice. in situ hybridisation analysis has detected adam <dig> gene expression in the pyramidal cells of ca1–ca <dig> fields and granule cells of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and in granular cells in the cerebellum  <cit> . it is unlikely that morphological changes during development led to impairment of spatial learning and motor coordination, and morphological alterations in the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampus and cerebellum were not observed in adam11-deficient mice after histological investigation using he staining. however, because it is thought that adam <dig> plays a role in neuron-neuron or neuron-glial cell interactions, a more precise morphological investigation will be needed. it has been reported that adhesion molecules, such as neural cell adhesion molecule , are not only implicated in cell interactions during nervous system development, but are also recognised as important mediators of synaptic plasticity in the adult nervous system  <cit> . changes in neuron excitability in the hippocampus, such as decreases in the post-burst after hyperpolarization , have been thought to affect long-term potentiation   <cit> , an experimental model of the synaptic changes thought to underlie learning and memory  <cit> . it has also been reported that mice lacking nmda receptor for both nr2a and nr2c subunits showed motor dysfunction and complete loss of both spontaneous and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents  in cerebellar granule cells  <cit> . therefore, electrophyological studies to enable analysis of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum of adam11-deficient mice will be needed. these studies might clarify whether adam <dig> plays an important signalling or structural role at the synaptic level and whether it participates in synaptic regulation.

adam11-deficient mice remained alive for more than one year without ataxia or tremor, but showed a deficit in spatial learning and motor dysfunction. on the other hand, mice lacking the adam <dig> gene showed severe ataxia, exhibited marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves, and died before weaning  <cit> . mice lacking the adam <dig> gene showed severe ataxia and tremor and died before weaning  <cit> . these findings suggest that adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adam <dig> have separate and important roles in the nervous system. a genome database search revealed orthologs of adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adam <dig> genes to exist in vertebrates such as mammals, fish, and amphibians, but not in invertebrates. although the precise molecular functions of these adams are still unclear, further investigations will provide clues to understanding the nervous system of higher organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
adam11-deficient mice survived more than one year without ataxia or tremor, showed no abnormalities in body weight gain, spontaneous motor activity, muscle strength, or walking patterns, and exhibited no apparent anatomical-histological changes. however, hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and cerebellum-dependent motor coordination in adam11-deficient mice were impaired when tested using water maze and rotating rod tasks. our genetically modified mouse strain has the potential to be a useful and sensitive tools for detailed investigation of adam proteins' functions in the nervous system.
