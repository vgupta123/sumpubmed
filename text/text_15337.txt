BACKGROUND
for many years, enterococcus faecalis was considered as an intestinal commensal, which only sporadically caused opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. during the last thirty years, however, e. faecalis has gained notoriety as one of the primary causative agents of nosocomial infections  <cit> , including urinary tract infections, endocarditis, intra-abdominal infections and bacteremia. the ability of e. faecalis to cause infection has been connected to inherent enterococcal traits, enabling the bacterium to tolerate diverse and harsh growth conditions. moreover, several putative enterococcal virulence factors have been characterized , and the role of these virulence factors in pathogenicity have been further established in various animal infection models  <cit>  and cultured cell lines  <cit> . reportedly, several of the proposed virulence determinants are enriched among infection-derived e. faecalis and/or e. faecium isolates, including esp   <cit> , hyl   <cit> , genes encoding collagen binding adhesins  <cit>  and other matrix-binding proteins  <cit> , and pilin loci  <cit> . on the other hand, recent studies on enterococcal pathogenicity have shown that a number of the putative virulence traits are present not only in infectious isolates but also in animal and environmental isolates  <cit> . this widespread distribution of putative virulence determinants in enterococcal isolates strongly suggest that enterococcal pathogenicity is not a result of any single virulence factor, but rather a more intricate process. indeed, the virulence potential of the newly sequenced laboratory strain e. faecalis og1rf was, despite its lack of several factors, comparable to that of the clinical isolate e. faecalis v <dig>  <cit> . bourgogne et al.  <cit>  proposed a scenario where the virulence of v <dig> and og1rf may be linked to genes that are unique to each of the two strains, but where the combined endeavor of the different gene-sets result in the ability to cause infection.

population structure studies of e. faecalis by multilocus sequence typing  have previously defined distinct clonal complexes  of e. faecalis enriched in hospitalized patients , designated high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes   <cit> . in one of our previous studies, we reported an overall correlation between mlst and bayesian phylogenetic analysis of gene content as revealed by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization   <cit> . this observation led us to speculate whether the virulence of different hireccs may be due to lineage-specific gene sets. in the present study we have used the comparative genomics approach to further investigate variation in gene content within e. faecalis, with a special focus on cc <dig>  this complex was chosen on the basis of previous bayesian-based phylogenetic reconstruction  <cit> . cc <dig> is equivalent to the previously designated bve complex, and comprises several clinically important e. faecalis isolates, including the first known beta-lactamase producing isolate hh <dig>  the first u.s. vancomycin-resistant isolate v <dig>  and pathogenicity island -harboring clinical bacteremia isolate mmh <dig>  <cit> . this cc represents a globally dispersed hospital-associated lineage, and identification of cc2-enriched genes may unravel novel fitness factors implicated in survival and spread of e. faecalis clones in the hospital environment.

RESULTS
overall genomic diversity
to explore the genetic diversity among e. faecalis, blast comparison was performed with  <dig> publicly available sequenced draft genomes, including the two cc2-strains tx <dig> , which is an endocarditis isolate, and hh <dig>  against the genome of strain v <dig>  which is also a st <dig> isolate. the number of v <dig> genes predicted to be present varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the  <dig> strains . in addition, we used cgh to investigate variation in gene content within  <dig> e. faecalis isolated in european hospital environments, with a special focus on a hospital-adapted subpopulation identified by mlst . of the  <dig> v <dig> genes represented on the array, the number of v <dig> orthologous genes classified as present ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . analysis of the compiled data set , revealed a total of  <dig> genes present in all strains, thus representing the e. faecalis core genome. none of the annotated v <dig> genes were found to be divergent in all the isolates analyzed.

putative cc2-enriched elements
in a previous study, we identified a set of potential pathogen-specific genes, which were entirely divergent in a collection of commensal baby isolates  <cit> . none of these genes were found to be present in all hospital-related isolates analyzed in the present study, neither was any gene found to be unique to any hirecc. in order to identify genes specifically enriched among strains belonging to cc <dig>  data from the present study were supplemented with hybridization data from an additional  <dig> strains of various origins . the additional data sets were obtained by hybridization to the same array as described above. all together, data from a total of  <dig> strains were analyzed, in addition to v <dig> . a genome-atlas presentation of the gene content in all the strains analyzed by cgh compared to the v <dig> genome is shown in figure  <dig>

by fisher's exact testing ,  <dig> genes were found to be more prevalent among cc2-strains than in non-cc2-strains . the cc2-enriched genes included large parts of phage <dig> , efab <dig>  and a phage-related region identified by mcbride et al.  <cit> , supporting the notion that the p <dig> genetic element may confer increased fitness in the hospital environment  <cit> . indeed, prophage-related genes constituted a predominant proportion of the cc2-enriched genes . interestingly, the tn916-like efab <dig> element has previously also been suggested to play a role in niche adaptation : cgh analysis identified an efab5-orthologous element in e. faecium that appeared to be common for hirecc e. faecalis and cc <dig> e. faecium, a hospital-adapted subpopulation identified by mlst. to further confirm the presence of the relevant mges in e. faecalis, we used pcr combining internal primers with primers targeting the genes flanking p <dig>  efab <dig> and the vanb-associated phage-related element in v <dig>  to monitor conserved v <dig> junctions on either side of the elements in  <dig> strains . seven strains contained the junctions on both sides of p <dig>  of which six strains were cc2-strains. eleven strains were positive for the junctions on both sides of efab <dig>  including nine cc2-strains, while thirteen strains gave positive pcr for both junctions of the phage-related element surrounding vanb, of which eleven strains belonged to cc <dig> . these results substantiate the theory of p <dig>  efab <dig> and the vanb-associated phage as cc2-enriched elements.

a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> putative cc2-enriched genes identified here, were associated with previously defined mges identified in v <dig>  <cit> . in addition to p <dig>  efab <dig> and the vanb-surrounding phage element, these included p <dig> , pai , p <dig> , p <dig>  and ptef <dig> and ptef <dig>  . in addition, a ten-gene cluster  with significant gc skew compared to the genome-average , was found to be significantly more frequent in strains belonging to cc <dig> than in non-cc <dig> strains. the deviation in gc content suggests that this genetic element may also be of foreign origin. this notion was further supported by the sequence similarities of several of the genes with known phage-related transcriptional regulators . moreover, ef <dig> to - <dig> showed high degree of identity  to efme980_ <dig> to - <dig> of the newly sequenced enterococcus faecium e <dig>  <cit> . efme980_ <dig> holds a domain characteristic of the aspartate aminotransferase superfamily of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. interestingly, ef <dig> encodes a putative helicase, while ef <dig> encodes a putative mutt protein, both with implications in dna repair  <cit> . a potential role of these genes in protection against oxidative dna damage induced in the hospital environment and during infection is plausible. to further investigate the distribution of ef <dig> to - <dig> in e. faecalis,  <dig> strains were screened by pcr :  <dig> cc2-strains held all ten genes, while  <dig> strains including two cc2-strains were devoid of the entire element. moreover,  <dig> strains contained ef <dig> only,  <dig> strains contained ef <dig> to - <dig>  while  <dig> strains, including og1rf, contained ef <dig> only. the two latter patterns of presence and divergence of ef <dig> to - <dig> were also obtained with blastn analysis of tx <dig> and og1rf, respectively, corroborating that these are indeed genuine polymorphisms in this locus. notably, in the og1rf genome five more genes  are also located between the homologs of ef <dig> and ef <dig>  <cit> , suggesting this locus may represent a hot spot for insertions. partial sequencing across the junction between ef <dig> and ef <dig> suggested that several of the non-cc <dig> strains carry genes homologous to og1rf_ <dig> to - <dig> in this locus .

mobile dna constitutes a substantial fraction of the e. faecalis v <dig> genome and transfer of mges and transposons thus plays an important role in the evolution of e. faecalis genomes  <cit> . the large pool of mobile elements also represents an abundant source of pseudogenes, as indel events occurring within coding regions often render genes nonfunctional. to verify the expression of the cc2-enriched genes, we correlated the list of enriched genes with data from two transcriptional analyses performed in our laboratory with the same array as used in the cgh experiment described in present study . transcription was confirmed for all but fifteen of the cc2-enriched genes , thus validating the expression of these reading frames. the fifteen genes, for which no transcripts were detected, were mainly located within efab <dig> and phage <dig> 

a constraint of the comparative genomic analyses presented here, is that the comparison of gene content is based on a single reference strain only . to compensate, we conducted a cc <dig> pangenome analysis with the draft genomes of cc2-strains hh <dig> and tx <dig> to identify putative cc2-enriched non-v <dig> genes. the pangenome analysis identified a total of  <dig> non-v <dig> orfs in the hh <dig> and tx <dig> . among these orfs, one gene cluster was identified as particularly interesting . notably, hmpref0348_ <dig> in tx <dig> represented the best blast hit for all the three orfs hmpref0364_ <dig> to - <dig> in hh <dig>  suggesting discrepancy in annotation between the two strains. sequencing across the gap between contig  <dig> and contig  <dig> in tx <dig> confirmed that hmpref0348_ <dig> and hmpref0348_ <dig> represent the two respective ends of a gene homologous to hmpref0346_ <dig> in hh <dig>  . the presence of the putative non-v <dig> cc2-enriched gene cluster among e. faecalis was further elucidated by pcr in our collection of strains . strains were screened for the presence of three individual genes  and the entire element, with primers hmpref0346_1868-f and hmpref0346_1861-r. fisher's exact testing  on the basis of the pcr data confirmed that the gene cluster was significantly enriched among cc <dig>  comparative sequence analysis of the flanking regions suggests that the gene cluster is located in the hh <dig> and tx <dig> versions of the e. faecalis pathogenicity island  <cit> . recently, a microarray-based assessment of pai-content in a set of clinical e. faecalis isolates revealed high degree of variation within the island, and an evidently modular evolution of the pai  <cit> , which would be consistent with acquisition by an indel event of this locus in the pai of tx <dig>  hh <dig> and other positive cc2-strains.

cc2-enriched surface-related structures
lepage et al.  <cit>  have previously identified eight genes as potential markers for the v583/mmh594-lineage, of which all except one gene  are found among the cc2-enriched genes in this study. interestingly, several of these genes were later assigned to a recently classified family of surface proteins, with a c-terminal wxl domain, proposed to form multi-component complexes on the cell surface  <cit> . siezen et al.  <cit>  termed these genes cell-surface complex  genes and postulated a role in carbon source acquisition. independently, brinster et al.  <cit>  showed that wxl domains are involved in peptidoglycan-binding. a total of nine wxl protein-coding genes, divided into three clusters , were identified as putative cc2-enriched genes in the present study. note that ef <dig> to -  <dig> does not represent a complete csc gene cluster, as not all four csc gene families  are present in the cluster  <cit> . interestingly, the og1rf genome sequence revealed homologues loci encoding wxl-proteins corresponding to the gene clusters ef <dig> to - <dig> and ef <dig> to - <dig> in v <dig>   <cit> . such homologs may possibly explain the divergence observed between cc <dig> and non-cc2-strains in the present study. indeed, blast analysis with the og1rf sequences against the e. faecalis draft genomes suggested that the og1rf_0209- <dig> and og1rf_0224- <dig> are widely distributed among non-cc <dig> e. faecalis. given the putative function in carbon metabolism, the observed sequence variation may be related to substrate specificity.

in addition to the wxl domain, ef <dig> also encodes a domain characteristic for the internalin family  <cit> . internalins are characterized by the presence of n-terminal leucine-rich repeats . the best characterized bacterial lrr proteins are inla and inlb from listeria monocytogenes, known to trigger internalization by normally non-phagocytic cells  <cit> . two internalin-like proteins were identified in e. faecalis v <dig> )  <cit> . recently, brinster et al.  <cit>  presented evidence of that elra play a role in e. faecalis virulence, both in early intracellular survival in macrophages and by stimulating the host inflammatory response through il- <dig> induction. moreover, by quantitative real-time pcr shepard and gilmore  <cit>  found that elra was induced in e. faecalis mmh <dig> during exponential growth in serum and during both exponential and stationary growth in urine. contradictory data have, however, been published for this and other strains using different methods  <cit> . although it is tempting to speculate that ef <dig> contributes to the interaction with the mammalian host, the role of internalins in e. faecalis pathogenesis is still not understood, and it may therefore be premature to extrapolate function solely on the basis of shared structural domains.

glycosyl transferase family proteins are involved in the formation of a number of cell surface structures such as glycolipids, glycoproteins and polysaccharides  <cit> . e. faecalis is in possession of several capsular polysaccharides  <cit> , with cps and epa being the best characterized. the epa  cluster represents a rhamnose-containing polysaccharide which was originally identified in e. faecalis og1rf  <cit> . the version of the epa cluster found in the v <dig> genome contains an insertion of four genes  compared to og1rf. this insertion appeared to be enriched among cc <dig>  while ef  <dig> and ef <dig> encodes transposases of the is <dig> family, the two remaining genes showed 100% identity to the two respective ends of a racemase domain protein in e. faecalis tx <dig>  neighboring the epa cluster, two glycosyl transferases  proposed as potential virulence factors  <cit> , are part of a three operon locus , possibly associated with lipopolysaccharide production. five of the genes within this locus were also found to be enriched among cc <dig> in the present study.

paulsen et al.  <cit>  also listed other putative surface-exposed virulence genes, including a choline-binding protein  and a putative mscramm  that based on our analysis were found to be enriched in cc <dig>  a role of cbps in pneumococcal colonization and virulence has been established  <cit> . a number of putative mscramms have been identified in e. faecalis  <cit> , however, only ace  has been characterized in detail: ace was shown to mediate binding to collagen , dentin and laminin  <cit> . lebreton et al.  <cit>  recently presented evidence of an in vivo function of ace in enterococcal infections other than involvement in the interaction with extracellular matrix. it was demonstrated that an ace deletion mutant was significantly impaired in virulence, both in an insect model and in an in vivo-in vitro murine macrophage models. the authors suggested that ace may promote e. faecalis phagocytosis and that it may also be possible that ace is involved in survival of enterococci inside phagocytic cells. also the structurally related mscramm, acm, found in e. faecium was recently reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of this bacterium  <cit> .

mucins are high molecular weight glycoproteins expressed by a wide variety of epithelial cells, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, and located at the interface between the cell and the surrounding environment  <cit> . the binding of bacteria to mucins through mucin-binding domain proteins is thought to promote colonization  <cit> . diversity in the carbohydrate side chains creates a significant heterogeneity among mucins of different origin , facilitating bacterial attachment to epithelial cells  <cit> . the non-v <dig> cc2-enriched gene cluster identified through in silico analysis in the present study harboured an orf  with homology to known mucin-binding domain proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified a set of genes that appear to be enriched among strains belonging to cc <dig>  since a significant proportion  of these genes code for proteins associated with cell surface structures, absence of or divergence in these loci may lead to antigenic variation. indeed, both mscramms and internalins have been identified as potential antigens of e. faecalis or other gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the genes encoding any of the established enterococcal virulence factors were not among the cc2-enriched genes. surface structures that promote adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to human tissue are also promising targets for creation of effective vaccines. however, functional studies of the individual cc2-enriched genes are required in order to distinguish their implications in enterococcal virulence.
