BACKGROUND
the human herpesvirus  <dig>  is well known for its peculiar tropism for endothelial cells and b lymphocytes  <cit> . in fact, it is the causative agent of kaposi’s sarcoma  and of several lympho-proliferative diseases, namely primary effusion lymphoma  and multicentric castleman’s disease. ks lesions are characterized by neo-angiogenesis and the production of typical spindle cells of endothelial origin  <cit> . hhv8-infection of cultured endothelial cells induces profound changes in the cellular phenotype, which resembles the spindle shape of ks lesion cells  <cit> . moreover, the virus induces relevant modifications in the behaviour of both primary and immortalized endothelial cells and causes an intense transcriptional reprogramming in human umbilical vein endothelial cells   <cit> . it also stimulates the warburg effect in latently infected time endothelial cells with an increase of glycolysis and glucose consumption  <cit>  and an activation of hypoxia-induced factors  <cit> . hhv <dig> is believed to establish persistent infection for the duration of the host’s lifespan, with occasional switching to the lytic phase of infection  <cit> . in addition, it has been demonstrated that the hhv <dig> latency-associated nuclear antigen  prolongs the lifespan of primary huvec and enhances cell survival in both serum-deprived conditions and in the presence of apoptotic inducers  <cit> . there are numerous examples in the literature that describe the biochemical and metabolic alterations in infected cells  <cit> . it has recently been found that pel and other non-viral lymphoma cells synthesize fatty acids from glucose at a higher rate and contain more lipid droplets  as compared to primary b cells. to sustain the requirements of the proliferating lymphoma cells, the newly synthesized fatty acids are rapidly stored in triglycerides  and/or incorporated into membrane lipids  <cit> . other authors have demonstrated that the increase of lipid synthesis and accumulation in lds is dependent upon hhv8-gene expression, even in the latent phase  <cit> . cholesteryl esters  as well as tgs are a common component of lds. they have been found in great numbers in several diseases, such as tumours, infections  <cit>  and atherosclerosis. however, ce synthesis, their content, and possible role during hhv8-infection have never been investigated  <cit> . for this reason, this study focuses on both ce and tg synthesis and their content during both lytic and latent hhv8-infection phases. we extended our investigation to the late latent phase because hhv8-latency leads to kaposi’s sarcoma and to other lymphoproliferative malignancies in humans, characterized by higher ce content. furthermore, we also investigated whether the inhibition of ce synthesis could affect neo-angiogenesis, which represents the main biological property acquired by infected cells, and is responsible for the remarkable metastatic potential of kaposi’s sarcoma.

methods
cells and viruses
a pool stock of huvec cells  was grown in a m <dig> medium  with low serum growth supplement . huvec cells were always kept in a semi-confluent state and were sub-cultured at least once a week. prior to the experiments, the cells had been sub-cultured no more than  <dig> to  <dig> times. hhv <dig> permanently infected bc <dig> cells were kindly donated by dr. caselli  <cit>  and were grown in a rpmi- <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum  . bc <dig> cells were used to produce 100x concentrated stocks of hhv <dig>  as previously described  <cit> . the virus pellet was suspended in rpmi, filtered through a  <dig>  μm filter and kept at -80°c until use. the quantitative analysis of virus genomes present in the stock preparation was obtained by a real-time polymerase chain reaction . the purified cell-free inoculums contained an average number of  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies of viral dna/ml . for cell infection, about  <dig>  × 104/ml huvec cells were seeded in  <dig> multi-well plates. the cells were infected with hhv <dig>  concentrated at a multiplicity of at least 10- <dig> genomes per cell in a m <dig> medium containing 2 μg/ml of polybrene for 2 h at 37°c. after 24-48 h the infected cells were observed with a light microscope to detect the typical spindle cell morphology. only cell monolayers with at least 70-80% of hhv8-infected cells were used for the experiments.

rt-pcr
the presence of hhv <dig> transcription in huvec cells was analyzed by rt-pcr for the amplification of the orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  genes. total rna was extracted with a purelink rna mini kit  and treated with turbo dnase  before the synthesis of cdna with a super script vilo kit . rt-pcr amplification was performed using 200 ng of total rna extracted from the infected cells as previously indicated  <cit> . primers and conditions for rt-pcr amplification were as follows: orf <dig> took place with primers orf <dig> fw 5′-gccgaaaggattccaccattgtgct-3′ and orf <dig> rev 5′- gggccccggccgatattttgg-3′ for 40 cycles  plus 10' at 72°c of extension; orf <dig> amplification took place with primers orf <dig> fw 5′-catgcagcggggtgagcctg-3′ and orf <dig> rev 5′- agcagcccggcggtatcgta-3′ for 40 cycles ; orf <dig> amplification took place with primers orf <dig> fw 5′- atcctcgggaaatctggtct-3′ and orf <dig> rev 5′-ttcagcgtttcagtgtctgc-3′ for 40 cycles  plus 10′ at 72°c of extension. the amplification of the housekeeping ß-actin gene  was used as a control with primers actb fw 5′-caccattggcaatgagcggttc-3′ and actb rev 5′- aggtctttgcggatgtccacgt-3′ for 40 cycles . rt-pcr products were run in 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. acquisition and image processing were performed by photodoc-it imaging system digital  and photopaint expression .

western blot analysis
the cells were lysed at 4°c in a pbs buffer containing 10% sds, 50 μg tris, 1 μm edta, ph  <dig> , 50 μm dtt and a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, homogenized by a up100h compact ultrasonic laboratory device . the protein content of each sample was determined by the bca assay   <cit>  and processed as previously described  <cit> . in particular, protein samples  were separated by electrophoresis  and transferred to nitrocellulose,  <dig>  μm pore size  by standard electro-blotting procedure. the blots were pre-treated with a blocking solution, chemiblocker™  diluted 1:3 v/v with tbst  for at least 1 h at rt before the addition of the primary antibodies  for k <dig>  a/b , ln <dig>  and β-actin . after overnight incubation at 4°c, the primary antibodies were removed and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added in a dilution range of 1: <dig> for at least 1 h at rt. all the antibodies were purchased from santacruz biotechnologies . proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence  and by exposure to x-ray film  for various times. densitometric quantification of the protein bands was then accomplished by image j software .

viral antigen immunodetection
the cells were processed for microscopy experiments  <dig>   <dig> and 24 days after viral infection. in order to carry out the experiments, both the controls and the hhv8-infected huvec cells were diluted from stock cultures, seeded  at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> in 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes  and cultured at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator in a growth medium for 24 h. after fixation with methanol for 10 min, cells were processed for viral immunodetection using a validated immunofluorescence kit assay  as indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions. bc <dig> cells were used as the positive control.

immunocytofluorescence and neutral lipid staining
the cells were processed for microscopy experiments  <dig>   <dig> and 24 days after viral infection. two series of experiments were carried out. both the controls and hhv8-infected huvec cells were diluted from stock cultures and seeded at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> in 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes  and cultured at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator in a growth medium. after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde  for 10 min, some cell cultures were stained with 300 nm nile red  in pbs  <cit>  and observed, in order to visualize neutral lipids in situ. nile red is a fluorescent dye that differentially stains polar lipids  and neutral lipids such as ces and tgs. polar lipids display a red emission, while neutral lipids have a green emission. red emission was observed with 540 ±  <dig>  nm excitation and  <dig> lp nm emission filters. green emission was observed with 460 ± 25 nm excitation and 535 ± 20 nm emission filters. furthermore, the other series of cell cultures was used to perform composite staining by firstly using a new neutral lipid probe called hcs lipidtox™ red neutral lipid , followed by an immunocytofluorescence method for identifying k <dig>   or lana  antigens  with fitc-conjugated secondary antibodies counterstained in the same cells with hoechst  <dig>  for nuclei. hcs lipidtox™ red neutral lipid stain has an extremely high affinity for neutral lipid droplets and is best imaged with filter sets appropriate for alexa fluor®  <dig> dye or texas red® dye . the xy coordinates were annotated in order to recognize the same microscopic field. treble staining allowed us to evaluate possible differences in neutral lipid content between the control and infected cells.

microscopy and imaging
microscope observations were performed with an olympus ix <dig> inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope  fitted with a 20×/ <dig>  or  <dig> ×/ <dig>  plan apochromatic objective. twelve bit-images were captured using a cooled ccd camera , electronically coupled to a mechanical shutter interposed between the 100 w hg lamp and the microscope so as to limit photo bleaching. in some cases the excitation light was attenuated with a 6% neutral density filter. nominal image resolution was  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm/pixel for  <dig> and  <dig> × objectives, respectively. quantitative analysis of images was performed with the image pro plus package . at least  <dig> microscopic fields and  <dig> cells were individually selected and measured for each experimental group. calculations were made with excel . normalized data represent the percentage of the mean density value  ± standard error .

determination of ce and tg synthesis
huvec cells were incubated for 4 h in a medium containing -oleate bound to bovine serum albumin . to prepare the oleate-bsa complex,  <dig>  mbq of -oleic acid in ethanol  were mixed with  <dig>  mg koh, after which the ethanol was evaporated. pbs  without ca2+ and mg2+, containing  <dig>  mg bsa  was added and the mixture shaken vigorously. this solution was added to each well to a final concentration of 74kbq/ml. after incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs and lipids extracted with acetone. the cell lysate was prepared for measuring protein content . neutral lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography , visualized by iodine vapors, and the incorporation of -oleate into ces and tgs was measured in a liquid scintillation counter.

angiogenic activity assay
the capillary-like micro-tubule formation in both the control and hhv8-infected cells was performed as reported in the literature  <cit> . 100 μl of geltrex matrix  were poured into the bottom of  <dig> well plates and left to solidify for 1 h at 37°c as indicated by the manufacturer. after this,  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells were seeded in a complete m <dig> medium and incubated for 24 h in a co <dig> incubator at 37°c. in some experiments the cells were incubated in a serum-free medium. the formation of capillary-like micro-tubules was checked under a light microscope after  <dig> and 24 h. the angiogenic index was calculated according to the literature  <cit> . in several experiments, the specific acat inhibitor, sandoz  <dig> , was used at a concentration of 4 μm which, as previously reported for other cell types  <cit> , was the dose that also totally inhibits cholesterol esterification in huvec cells  without altering viability and cell growth. all the samples were prepared in triplicate and the experiments were repeated at least twice.table  <dig>

control and hhv8-infected huvec and bc <dig> cells  were treated with sandoz  <dig>  for 24 h. before the last 4 h, -oleate bound to bsa was added to the medium and cells were incubated for the remaining time. subsequently, cells were washed with ice-cold pbs and lipids extracted with acetone. neutral lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography , and the incorporation of -oleate into ces was determined as described in methods. data were reported as percentage of dpm/ <dig> cells mean ± se. significance was set up when p <  <dig>   vs. respective control .



statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed with graphpad prism  software and statistica . all data were expressed as the mean ± se of experiments in triplicate and analyzed by the t-student test or anova, and lsd-fisher as a post-hoc test when required. data were considered significant when p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
characterization of lytic and latent phases during long term hhv <dig> infection of huvec cells
hhv8-infected cells were in good shape and continued to replicate for up to 6- <dig> weeks after infection, whereas control cells started to slow their growth and show signs of senescence after 4 weeks of culture. for this reason, our experiments were performed from  <dig> to 24 days after infection . on days  <dig> and  <dig>  lytic genes orf <dig> and orf <dig> were both clearly expressed, whilst latent gene orf <dig>  slightly expressed on day  <dig>  was the only gene transcribed on day  <dig>  gene expression data were confirmed by western blotting analysis  and immunofluorescence detection for lytic  and latent  viral-antigens . indeed, on day  <dig> at least 70-80% of cells were k <dig> -positive; on day  <dig> a mixed population of either k <dig> - or lana-positive cells was present, whereas on day  <dig> about 40-60% of cells were lana-positive.figure  <dig>

neutral lipid accumulation in lipid droplets in hhv8-infected huvec cells
figure 2a shows a remarkable increase of neutral lipids in lds in all the hhv8-infected cells when compared to the respective control. as demonstrated by imaging analysis, the highest increase was observed on day  <dig> . as is evident from the images, there is a heterogeneous distribution of lds throughout the cells, probably due to the mixed population of infected/uninfected cells. in order to ascertain whether the neutral lipid increase was a peculiarity of the infected cells, we next used a double stain for neutral lipids  combined with fitc-conjugated antibodies  for the detection of viral-antigens, namely k <dig>  on day  <dig> and lana on days  <dig> and  <dig> . imaging analysis of the merged images demonstrated that lds were definitely higher in infected-cells . in particular, when the lds were only evaluated in infected cells, the strong increase of lds was more evident on day  <dig> . the differences between the infected and control cells were statistically significant .figure  <dig>

synthesis of tgs and ces in hhv <dig> infected huvec cells
neutral lipids stored in lds are variably constituted by tgs and ces. to evaluate their major component in infected cells, we measured tg and ce synthesis at the different phases of infection. as demonstrated in figure 4a, on days  <dig> and  <dig>  tg synthesis was higher than the respective control, but significant only on day  <dig> , whereas on day  <dig>  tg synthesis significantly decreased . however, ce synthesis did not change on days  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas, on day  <dig> when all the infected cells were in a latent state, ce synthesis was about 69% higher than the respective control .figure  <dig>

ce synthesis inhibition induces impairment of huvec cell neo-angiogenic activity
in order to verify whether neutral lipids, specifically ces, could somehow also be involved in the peculiar modifications induced by lytic or latent hhv <dig> infection, we evaluated their possible role in neo-angiogenesis, which is typically enhanced in hhv8-infected cells. in fact, the neo-angiogenic properties of hhv <dig> are necessary for the formation of the characteristic lesions of kaposi’s angiosarcoma  <cit> . in the angiogenic activity assay, both control and lytic  or latent  hhv8-infected cells produced micro-tubules within 24 h . the specific inhibitor of ce synthesis sz  <dig> significantly reduced tubule formation in infected cells on day  <dig>  but not during the lytic infection . interestingly, control cells grown in a serum-free m <dig> medium were not able to produce complete capillary micro-tubules, whilst hhv8-infected cells still formed regular and almost normal tubules . furthermore, in these conditions  sz was also able to dramatically reduce tubule formation  in both lytic and latent infection, as confirmed by evaluation of the angiogenic index   <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
hhv <dig> is known for its endothelial tropism and is generally related to proliferative diseases, mainly ks. recently, dysfunctional glucose metabolism in vitro  <cit> , and a high prevalence of hhv <dig> infection in subjects with diabetes mellitus  <cit>  have been reported. neutral lipid increase in lds, mainly tgs, has been reported in several herpes virus infections, and considered an effect of the reprogramming induced by the viral infection to consent virion production  <cit> . a few reports have described the presence of hhv <dig> in plaque lesions, but the possible correlation with atherosclerosis has yet to be clarified  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated neutral lipid metabolism and ld content during the lytic and latent phases of endothelial hhv8-infection. in fact, most studies have investigated the effect of cell reprogramming on lipids in the first days of infection. we present a model that allows the hhv8-infectious effect on cell metabolism to be investigated from the lytic to the late latent phase for up to more than three weeks, which is particularly suitable for hhv8-infection of endothelial cells. even though, as shown by immunofluorescence, 40-60% of cells still appeared to be infected on day  <dig> after infection, it was not possible to prolong the experiment any further because the cells gradually lost their viral episome and rapidly started to show some signs of senescence . tg synthesis was increased in the lytic phase. the fact that cholesterol esterification was not significantly modified for up to 14 days suggests that the higher ld content was due to tg content. conversely, tg synthesis was lower, whereas cholesterol esterification underwent a remarkable increase in the latent phase, suggesting that, while tgs are prominent in the lytic phase, ces are the prominent neutral lipid fraction in the late latent phase. it is worth noting that we performed our lipid synthesis analysis in a mixed population of infected/uninfected cells, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence. based on this consideration, it is likely that our results could be underestimated. to overcome this problem, we double-stained neutral lipids  and viral-antigens  in the same cells, and the results confirmed that neutral lipids increased only in infected cells. an increase of tg-enriched lds during the lytic phase of viral infection has often been reported for hcv virus. in fact, it has been suggested that the virus uses tg-enriched lds as a platform for the assembly of nascent virions, and that the hcv core protein is a main player in the manipulation of these organelles  <cit> . overall, these observations highlight that a range of viruses  have evolved mechanisms to interact with lds and possibly to subvert the function of these organelles, so as to use them as a platform for viral particle assembly  <cit> . accordingly, our results support the fact that tg synthesis and ld increase are mainly necessary during active virus replication. on the contrary, in the latent phase of hhv8-infection, ld content seems to be mainly constituted by ces, as suggested by the high rate of cholesterol esterification. high ce content and cholesterol esterification increase are frequently reported in cancer cells and tumours  <cit> . the storage of ces has been related to the large amount of cholesterol needed by malignant cells to sustain membrane biogenesis. although the real significance of ces in cancer cells is far from being clarified, ces have recently been related to the aggressiveness and metastatic properties of prostate cancer  <cit> . for the first time, we observed the increase of cholesterol esterification in the latent phase, which can be considered equivalent to persistent infection in humans, and as leading to ks. the most common pathogenic effect expressed by hhv <dig> in ks is represented by the angiogenic activity of infected cells. accordingly, angiogenesis is one of the major effects produced by hhv8-chronic infection in vitro and, just as in cancer cells, still present even in serum-deprived conditions  <cit> . for these reasons, we inhibited ce formation using a specific acat inhibitor , which is able to inhibit cholesterol esterification up to 90%, but does not affect tg synthesis. in contrast with the control, hhv8-infected cells produced micro-tubules even in serum-deprived conditions. interestingly, the inhibition of ce formation was accompanied by a remarkable reduction of micro-tubules in hhv8-infected cells.

CONCLUSIONS
hhv8-infection induces an enhancement of neutral lipid synthesis and the accumulation of lds in huvec cells. the tg increase in the lytic phase is probably related to peculiar metabolic viral requirements. on the other hand, ces seem to be closely related to the angiogenic properties of the infected cells, mainly in the latent phase of infection, suggesting that these neutral lipids may, in some way, be functionally involved in regulating the malignant process. these findings suggest that the use of cholesterol esterification inhibitors on hhv8-derived tumours could be a useful therapeutic tool in ks. in fact, angiogenesis inhibition may help to prevent the occurrence of the diffusion of angiosarcoma and metastasis.
