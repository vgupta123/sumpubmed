BACKGROUND
respiration generates the cellular energy required for the fundamental biological processes of growth, development and reproduction. the pathways involved in respiration are well characterised, flowing from glycolysis to the krebs cycle, along with well-understood branch points, including the pentose phosphate pathway activated during periods of oxidative stress  <cit>  and increased lipid biosynthesis  <cit> . nonetheless, how these pathways as a whole evolve to allow organisms to live in different environments and adopt new life history traits that might require altered energy levels requires further attention  <cit> .

enzymes in metabolic pathways are kinetically entwined in a complex conveyer belt of substrate to end-product  <cit> . as a result of this interdependence, mutations that alter in vitro catalytic activity may not alter the observed in vivo phenotype  <cit> . enzymes with the greatest flux control through pathways are likely targets of natural selection  <cit> , due to the probability of fixation of any adaptive change associated to its conferred advantage. flux control may be proportionally distributed across the pathway  <cit>  or asymmetrically localised in enzymes at the top of the pathway  <cit> . the evolution and incidence of selection is dependent on the properties and complexities of the pathway, with the disparity between current and optimal flux being a key factor  <cit> . the evolution of flux control and selection on enzyme polymorphisms has been intensively studied in the glycolytic pathway of drosophila <cit> .

glycolysis comprises a series of ten enzyme-catalysed reactions that convert glucose to pyruvate, the substrate for the krebs cycle. concurrently, glycolysis also generates small quantities of atp and nadh that are utilised by downstream high-energy yielding processes. although glycolysis is an essential biological pathway conserved across all eukaryotes, the component enzymes exhibit extensive variation at both the nucleotide and protein levels, which may be the target of selection  <cit> . in drosophila, positive selection is centred on the glucose-6-phosphate intersection for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway  <cit> . the branch point enzymes are hypothesised to possess novel flux control resulting in higher selection coefficients for adaptive mutations  <cit> . in the drosophila species studied, branch point enzymes accumulate more adaptive mutations than enzymes at the top of the pathway, which are conserved by strong purifying selection  <cit> . simulations provide theoretical support for this empirical evidence, and make the prediction that the further flux is from optimum, the more likely adaptive substitutions are to occur disproportionately in branching enzymes  <cit> . further work is required in species with diverse metabolic demands to test the generality of the drosophila findings  <cit> . positive selection and adaptation within glycolysis and its connecting pathways are likely to be a balance between maintaining cellular energy production, reducing the associated damage caused by oxidative stress  <cit> , and efficiently exploiting the available substrate storage pools   <cit> .

a majority of evidence for selection within the glycolytic enzymes, and its correlation with fitness, has been accumulated for the dimeric enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase , which is not a rate-limiting step in glycolysis  <cit> . variation in pgi has been associated with flight performance, thermal adaptation and other fitness-related traits in a diverse array of organisms  <cit> , including arthropods  <cit> , bacteria  <cit> , molluscs  <cit> , and plants  <cit> . pgi is thought to be under climate-related directional selection in the beetle chrysomela aeneicollis , where distinct alleles with functional and physiological differences are restricted to cold or warm habitats  <cit> . comparisons between colias and melitaea cinixia butterfly pgi nuclear polymorphisms indicate convergent evolution  <cit> . increased colias survival  <cit>  and m. cinixia population growth rates  <cit>  have both been correlated with pgi allelic variants. this variation is likely a product of long-term balancing selection on charge-changing amino acid substitutions on external loops of the protein’s surface  <cit> . the consistent association of pgi polymorphisms with variation in individual performance, coupled with no known duplication events in arthropods, has led to this locus being proposed as a general adaptive marker for conservation genetics in this phylum, akin to mhc in vertebrates  <cit> .

flight  <cit>  and adaptation to low temperature  <cit>  are both linked with varying energy demands and increased oxidative stress. the metabolic rate of insects during flight may increase by over a 100-fold compared with when they are at rest  <cit> . this metabolically-demanding activity results in increased oxidative stress, which causes cellular damage and even increased mortality in houseflies   <cit> . furthermore, the increased energy demand of flight may require the insect to exploit different fuels, as seen in the flight-capable morphs of the wing-polymorphic cricket , where winged individuals increase lipid biosynthesis in preparation for flight  <cit> . similar patterns are observed in insects exposed to low temperatures, where depressed metabolic rates result in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species  <cit>  and there is increased lipid biosynthesis in preparation for overwintering in several insect species  <cit> . one way to test the impact of varying metabolic demands on the evolution of glycolysis is to study variation in these component genes across related taxa that have evolved to new, potentially stressful lifestyles, and that vary in their ability to fly.

the australasian lanceocercata stick insects  form a monophyletic clade  <cit>  comprising species from five subfamilies, pachymorphinae, tropidoderinae, xeroderinae, phasmatinae, eurycanthinae, and platycraninae, with distinct morphological characters  <cit> . the lancerocercata have undergone an impressive evolutionary radiation over the last  <dig> mya  <cit> . this includes the convergent evolution of different body forms  <cit> , loss of flight in one or both sexes, shifts in diet, and adaptation to low-temperature environments in new zealand, including four wingless species found in high alpine areas where they regularly experience sub-zero temperatures  <cit> . these contrasting lifestyles within lanceocercata are expected to afford a diverse range of metabolic demands. this diversity provides a comprehensive model system in which to determine whether glycolysis has been the target of positive selection, and if so, at which steps and even at which sites within these enzymes selection has occurred. to pinpoint positive selection within lanceocercata we obtained partial cdna sequences of seven core glycolytic enzymes, together with the enzymes immediately before and after the pathway, across a phylogeny of  <dig> lanceocercata species. we found that the pgi gene has been duplicated within lanceocercata, with at least two of the three paralogous copies and gapdh evolving under positive selection.

RESULTS
dna sequencing of genes from glycolysis
we used de novo transcriptomes derived from  <dig> sequencing of three new zealand species  to design pcr primers and amplify  <dig> genes to reconstruct the evolutionary history of  <dig> lanceocercata stick insects. of these partial gene transcripts, ten were distributed across the glycolytic pathway, including seven of the ten core enzymes . in addition, six nuclear protein coding genes with a variety of cellular functions , two mitochondrial genes , and 28s rdna were sequenced from cdna for phylogenetic reconstruction.

pgi duplications
although only a single copy of pgi has been previously characterised in arthropods, the transcriptome assemblies revealed three paralogous copies of pgi within lanceocercata, with the duplication events presumably occurring after the split between timema and all other phasmatodea , which occurred more than  <dig> myr ago  <cit> . sequences of the full length open reading frame from the transcriptomes show extensive predicted amino acid variation within and among pgi paralogues , with the percentage of identical amino acid sites within the three species being higher for pairwise comparisons among orthologues  than paralogues . subsequent pcr amplification of pgi paralogues across a wider range of species was possible from a region within pgi <dig>  and pgi <dig> , but not from pgi <dig> due to the lack of unique primer binding sites.

lanceocercata phylogeny reconstruction
to infer evolutionary relationships among the sampled lanceocercata species, a combined bayesian phylogeny  was constructed from a  <dig>  bp partitioned alignment of the  <dig> protein coding genes and 28s. an average of  <dig>  bp of sequence data was used per species, with the minimum of  <dig>  bp  and a maximum of  <dig>  bp . this combined phylogeny has variable support for a monophyletic clade containing all new zealand species. the different lifestyles of flight and alpine habitation are scattered across the phylogeny.

codons under positive selection in the glycolytic pathway
the selective pressures acting on a protein-coding dna sequence can be inferred from the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions . purifying selection is indicated by ω < <dig>  whereas ω = <dig> implies neutral evolution and ω > <dig> indicates positive selection  <cit> . typically, selection acts on relatively few amino acid sites within a protein-coding gene. as a result, standard neutrality tests that average ω across the entire reading frame often fail to infer incidences of positive selection  <cit> . amino acid residues likely to have been influenced by positive selection within a protein can be identified by estimating ω with site-based maximum likelihood methods  <cit> , even though this approach may be overly conservative  <cit> . positive selection can be inferred by comparing the goodness of fit for a set of nested models. models that allow ω to vary above one to include the effect of positive selection are compared with null models where ω is not allowed to fluctuate above  <dig>  meaning the observed nucleotide variation is solely a product of purifying selection and neutrality. likelihood ratio tests and chi-square distributions are used to assess the statistical significance between the models.

site-based likelihood models were used to infer positive selection acting on ten lanceocercata genes associated with the glycolytic pathway . we found that all glycolysis genes are predominantly evolving under the influence of strong purifying selection when a single value of ω is calculated across the protein coding sequences using the one-ratio  model . however, there is significant among-site variation in ω within all genes, with the m <dig> model permitting three ω values, providing a significantly better fit to the data than the m <dig> model . to test for positive selection the m <dig> beta neutral model with eight categories of ω, all less than one and together comprising a beta distribution, is compared with the m <dig> model that has one additional ω value that is free to vary above one and therefore account for positive selection. the m <dig> model is a significantly better fit for three core glycolysis genes , pgi <dig> , gapdh  and aldose 1-epimerase ; d.f. = 2), which links glycolysis to the leloir pathway, indicating positive selection acts on these genes . a more conservative likelihood ratio test for positive selection replaces the m <dig> null model with m8a, which has an extra category of ω fixed at one. the m8:m8a nested model comparison identifies positive selection in pgi <dig>  and pgi <dig>  . the most stringent approach to identify positive selection compares the m1a null model, which has two values of ω , and m2a, which has an additional third category of ω that is greater than one. this approach still identifies positive selection in pgi <dig> , suggesting that this inference is especially robust.

amino acid sites under positive selection in the glycolytic pathway
four genes had sites identified under positive selection in the nested m7:m <dig> site models. a subsequent bayes empirical bayes  method implemented in paml was used to assess the significance of the ω ratio at each of these positively selected codon positions. in total six codons were identified as under significant positive selection  > 95%; table 2). these include one site in gapdh , two in pgi <dig>  and three in pgi <dig> . all these codons involve predicted amino acid substitutions that vary in residue polarity and hydrophobicity, apart from asn <dig> in gapdh, where only hydrophobicity is altered . the two pgi paralogues share a similar pattern of beb posterior probabilities , with regions of high posterior probability  being predominately located in disordered regions of the protein secondary structure  as opposed to well-structured α-helices  or β-strands . disordered regions are defined as areas that in isolation do not fold into well-defined 3d structures and conversely sample a large portion of the available conformational space, including features such as loops and extended domains  <cit> . in other arthropod species, sites identified as either under positive selection, balancing selection, associated with fitness differences or segregating between species in pgi also predominately occur within these disordered regions . there is direct overlap between val <dig> in pgi <dig>  which is under positive selection , and the homologous site in pgi <dig> . additionally, asn <dig>  which is under positive selection in pgi <dig>  is homologous to a segregating site between colias sp.   <cit> .

high resolution crystal structures of the glycolytic enzymes are available, allowing the location of codons identified as under positive selection by the beb analysis to be visualised in a structural context. predicted structural models of full length micrarchus nov. sp.  <dig> protein sequences were generated using swiss-model  <cit> . pgi <dig> and pgi <dig> were modelled against the pig pgi structure  <cit>  , whereas gapdh was modelled against the spiny blue lobster gapdh structure  <cit>  . five of six residues under positive selection in these enzymes are located on the surface of the protein . none of the sites under positive selection are closely associated with the conserved active site residues .

discussion
here we infer positive selection within the glycolytic pathway of australasian lanceocerata stick insects encompassing a wide diversity of lifestyles and habitats. the genes under positive selection are not key metabolic control steps regulating flux through the glycolytic pathway. across the pathway, pgi and gapdh exhibit the strongest signal for positive selection using the conservative codon-based likelihood methods. this may be attributed to their positions in the glycolysis pathway and association with branch points diverting flux through the pentose phosphate pathway  .

the ppp synthesises nadph for lipid biosynthesis and to neutralise reactive oxygen species accumulated during periods of oxidative stress  <cit> . pgi allelic variants and gapdh inactivation are respectively known to differentially regulate flux through the ppp in the sea anemone metridium senile <cit>  and c. elegans <cit> . excess nadph synthesised by the ppp may play an important role in adaptation to novel stressful life histories by allowing insects either to exploit different energy storage pools, or to compensate for increased oxidative stress, or both. increased lipid biosynthesis is documented in overwintering insects  <cit>  and winged morphs of gryllus firmus <cit> . insects are also particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to:  their tracheal respiratory system;  herbivorous diets being rich in pro-oxidants  <cit> ;  extreme demand for oxygen during flight  <cit> ; and  exposure to low-temperature  <cit> .

the amino acid substitutions at the sites inferred to be under positive selection do not discretely partition among different life history strategies. the lack of a clear pattern may in part be due to the complexity of their life-history traits. for example, alpine species may experience selection for vastly different metabolic regimes depending on whether they are freeze tolerant or freeze avoidant  <cit> . understanding how adaptation to new stressful lifestyles alters flux through both the glycolytic and ppp will require integrated biochemical enzyme assays in relation to sites under positive selection  <cit> , and will ultimately indicate the relative importance of maintaining energy production against exploiting the different energy storage pools and reducing the cost of stress induced oxidative damage in adaptation.

the continued association of pgi with an array of fitness measures has led to the suggestion that this locus could be used as an adaptive marker in arthropods  <cit> . however, the occurrence of paralogues affects its practical implementation using traditional pcr-based methods, at least in the euphasmatodea. gene duplications may become fixed if there is existing balancing selection, as the fixation of both original alleles removes the possibility of the deleterious occurrence of homozygotes at the original locus  <cit> . the pgi duplications in lanceocercata are possibly a consequence of existing balancing selection preceding subsequent gene duplication. gene duplications may eventually lead to subfunctionalisation of tissue-specific forms of the protein, as seen in teleost fish pgi <cit>  and tpi <cit> .

the positive selection acting on pgi <dig> and pgi <dig> results in changes to the polarity and hydrophobicity of the translated amino acids. the charge-changing amino acid substitutions in the stick insect pgi proteins may cause biochemical and fitness differences similar to those observed in colias pgi  <cit> . in both stick insects and colias, a majority of these sites occur in disordered regions of the pgi secondary structure, in regions that are more conformationally-flexible than the α-helices and β-strands. these intrinsically-disordered protein regions are thought to tolerate increased genetic variation and are important for maintaining adaptive potential  <cit> . furthermore, protein function is maintained by purifying selection against internal changes that may disrupt enzyme function, restricting positive selection to amino acids exposed to the surface of the protein’s three dimensional structure  <cit> . relatively few modifications are required for environment-specific adaptations to develop, as seen in vertebrate rhodopsin where 94% of amino acid sites are evolving neutrally  <cit> , and in mytilus mussels where temperature adaptation in isocitrate dehydrogenase is driven by two amino acid substitutions  <cit> . while surface modifications can alter catalytic performance of enzymes, as seen in lactate dehydrogenase  <cit> , they are more likely to affect a protein’s thermal stability  <cit> . a similar pattern of positive selection across the overlapping protein coding sequence is observed in the pgi paralogues investigated here. there is also correspondence in the position of sites under positive directional selection in the stick insects and those identified as either under positive selection, associated with fitness differences or segregating between other arthropod species . a majority of the pgi coding sequence is conserved by strong purifying selection maintaining protein function. however, positive selection appears to be able to act on specific portions of the pgi gene that are:  intrinsically disordered regions of the protein structure where genetic variation is maintained; and  surface residues that can influence enzyme conformation and efficiency. modifications within these convergent windows of positive selection are presumably responsible for driving enzyme properties towards local optima in response to a host of species-specific adaptations.

CONCLUSIONS
these results from lanceocercata stick insects illustrate that adaptations within metabolic pathways may be a delicate trade-off between maintaining energy production, optimally exploiting different energy pools, and reducing the effects of increased oxidative stress in the system. maintaining this balance affects organisms regardless of the adaptation, and selection likely targets enzymes at branch points due to their pleiotropic effects on flux through metabolic pathways. the complexity of enzyme and pathway interactions requires further integrative studies to understand how the metabolic network evolves as a whole.
