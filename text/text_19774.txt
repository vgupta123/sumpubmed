BACKGROUND
pigs are important domesticated animals that provide an important source of meat in china and the whole world. pigs in east asia originated from the east asian wild boar and were domesticated approximately  <dig>  years ago  <cit> . natural and artificial selection have promoted the development of significant differences in morphology, growth, fertility, and local fitness between domesticated and wild pigs  <cit> . various chinese local pig breeds have been produced through domestication and breeding. statistical data from the united nations food and agricultural organization  indicated that  <dig> native pig breeds, which accounted for 24 % of the global count, were available in china in  <dig>  <cit> ; these breeds may be classified into six types: north china , south china , central china , jianghai , southwest china , and plateau. diverse breeds of local pigs present valuable genetic resources  <cit> . pigs from different regions show substantial variations in physiological features. for instance, taihu pigs from jh exhibit high fecundity; cc- and sc-type pigs show high adipose contents, which possibly contribute to the good taste of meat from these pigs; and plateau- and nc-type pigs contain more lean meat than fat. clearly, pigs from different regions in china have developed different characteristics that have enabled them to adapt to particular environments and conditions during microevolution. however, the molecular evolutionary mechanisms underlying the diversity of the same traits among different pig breeds during domestication and improvement remain unclear. several genes plays important roles in species domestication and breed divergence . as key factors in pig domestication, non-coding rnas have been speculated to serve important functions in pig domestication and breeding  <cit> .

non-coding genes are dna sequences that produce rna with no translational ability  <cit> . most non-coding rnas can regulate gene expression  <cit> . the long non-coding gene h <dig> is located in the h19/igf <dig> imprinted gene cluster. studies on mice and human have shown that the h <dig> gene contributes to the growth, development, and generation of muscle fibers .

aside from genetic mutations, epigenetic mechanisms also influence gene expression and explain how gene-environment interactions yield particular phenotypes during development  <cit> . in particular, some complex genetic phenomena cannot be explained by dna variations alone, but integrated with epigenetic systems, such as dna methylation with strong reversibility, microrna regulation or histone modification, which can be passed to subsequent generations  <cit> . recent studies have suggested that the h <dig> gene influences embryonic growth and development as well as skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration via epigenetic mechanisms, such as dna methylation. abnormal methylation of the h <dig> gene may be associated with cancer formation  <cit> . in addition, research on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying beckwith-wiedemann syndrome   <cit>  and silver-russell syndrome   <cit>  has shown that methylation of the h <dig> gene exerts a pronounced effect on disease and muscle development. pidsley  <cit>  analyzed dna methylation and genotypes in three differential methylated regions  and investigated the h <dig> promoter in the h19/igf <dig> cluster in humans; results showed that dna methylation is strongly associated with cerebellum weight  <cit> . these findings indicate that h <dig> methylation exerts a pronounced effect on disease and muscle development.

pigs are highly domesticated animals that drastically vary in meat features depending on the breed and geographic location. the h <dig> gene contributes to the skeletal muscle growth and development of animals through both genetic variation and epigenetic modification. therefore, h <dig> was speculated to play a vital role in porcine domestication and breed divergence via genetic mutation and/or epigenetic changes.

to understand the molecular evolution pattern and methylation pattern of the h <dig> gene in relation to pig domestication and breed divergence, the h <dig> gene and its flanking region were analyzed using the homologous sequence of  <dig> species by phast software  <cit>  and mega software  <cit> . results revealed that the h <dig> gene is relatively conservative in a large-scale evolution. published re-sequencing data  <cit>  of  <dig> wild boars from tibet,  <dig> wild boars from sichuan, and  <dig> native pig breeds from other regions in china were initially used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the h <dig> gene. most snp sites were distributed in the 3′-terminal of the h <dig> gene. candidate snps from  <dig> chinese native pig breeds and  <dig> foreign pig breeds  were also subjected to clone sequencing to survey the snps obtained using polymerase chain reaction . the nucleotide diversity and f‑statistics  along the upstream, gene body, and downstream regions of the h <dig> gene were analyzed using the re-sequencing data of  <dig> tibetan wild boars,  <dig> wild boars from sichuan, and  <dig> chinese native pig breeds. the h <dig> gene was conserved during domestication and had a high divergence in the domestication pig population, indicating the functional role of this gene. separate methylated dna immunoprecipitation sequencing  data were obtained from eight adipose tissues and two muscle tissues of three specimens of tibetan wild boars, rongchang pigs, and landrace pigs. single base-resolution bisulfate methylation sequencing data of liver tissue from one chinese enshi pig, one landrace pig, and one guizhou wild boar were also obtained . data from medip-seq and bisulfite sequencing were then used to compare the methylation patterns of the h <dig> gene between domesticated pigs and boars. the possible role of the h <dig> gene during pig domestication and breed divergence was systematically described on the basis of molecular evolution analysis results, epigenetics differences, and gene expression data.

RESULTS
evolution of h <dig> among mammals
the evolution of the h <dig> gene was first analyzed on a large phylogenetic scale to assess its evolutionary status. basing from the h <dig> gene transcript sequence and mitochondrial sequence of  <dig> mammals, we constructed a gene tree and a phylogenetic tree by using mega <dig>  the gene tree  was largely consistent with the phylogenetic tree . results showed that primates and rodents cluster into independent clades and exhibited a close relationship than sus scrofa.fig.  <dig> molecular phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood method. the evolutionary history of h <dig> gene  and mitochondria of  <dig> species  were inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on the kimura 2-parameter model  <cit> . the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig> replicates  <cit>  is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50 % bootstrap replicates are collapsed. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  are shown next to the branches



conservation scores were calculated using phastcons  <cit>  to prove that the h <dig> gene was conserved during large-scale evolution and to identify the conserved and accelerated evolutionary regions in the gene among the  <dig> species. results showed that the upstream region of the h <dig> gene was lowly conserved whereas the gene body, specifically exon <dig>  was highly conserved . phylop was used to calculate the p-value of conservation or acceleration, and results indicated that the h <dig> gene was conserved during evolution within a broad range . the evolution of h <dig> on a large phylogenetic scale indicates that the gene was highly conserved within abroad range, including the 3' region of h <dig> fig.  <dig> phastcon score and phylop value of h <dig> among  <dig> species  <cit> . the phastcons score  and the phylop value  of h <dig> gene body among  <dig> species was calculated and then was calculated using sliding window for segments of 1000 bp with 300 bp intervals



screening for selective signal
we analyzed the published re-sequencing data  <cit>  on h <dig> to detect a selective sweep of the h <dig> gene during domestication on a genomic scale. we identified eight alleles among the domestic pigs, wild boars, and tibetan boars. although all of the eight alleles were detected in the domestic pigs, a large portion of these alleles were homozygous in pig individuals . this high degree of homozygosity implies that the gene is associated with pig breeding  <cit> . we further calculated the π and pairwise fst of the linked upstream, gene body, and downstream genomic regions of the h <dig> gene in  <dig> tibetan wild boars,  <dig> domesticated pigs, and  <dig> wild boars from sichuan with 1 kb sliding windows and 300 bp steps . the π value within the h <dig> gene body was significantly higher in domestic pigs than in wild boars . this result suggests that the h <dig> gene sequence conservation within wild boars is sharply contrasted with the sequence diversity among the h <dig> alleles found within domestic pigs. within the domesticated pig population, the upstream and downstream regions of the h <dig> gene showed a low diversity, which is similar to that in wild populations . by contrast, the h <dig> gene body exhibited a high diversity . this phenomenon may be caused by selection relaxation. however, considering the abundant occurrence of breed differentiation within domesticated pigs, we suspected that h <dig> might have undergone genetic differentiation during breed differentiation and pig domestication. we also detected that the fst of the h <dig> gene body between domesticated pigs and wild boars was higher than that of h <dig> downstream .fig.  <dig> patterns of nucleotide diversity and pair-wise population differentiation of h <dig> locus in domesticated pigs and wild boars. sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity and genetic differentiation coefficient between groups at h <dig> for domesticated pigs  and wild boars . π  and fst  was calculated for segments of 1000 bp with 300 bp intervals . the distribution of nucleotide diversity  and fst within h <dig> gene  and linked upstream and downstream 6 kb  was shown in the boxplot, the middle thick black line represent median.θπ ratio was calculated by π.dome/π.wild, the red dash line and green dash line respectively represent the average θπ ratio and the average fst of the whole genome of susscrofa




to detect whether or not h <dig> is under selection, we obtained the whole-genome nucleotide divergence  of domesticated and wild pigs, as well as the population difference  between domesticated and wild pigs, by using tibetan re-sequencing data with gatk software  <cit> . comparison of the sliding windows of π value and fst between domesticated and wild pigs , showed that the domesticated pigs have a significantly higher diversity than wild pigs in the h <dig> gene . this results suggests that h <dig> in domestic pig breeds might have experienced a more rapid evolution than that in wild ones. the fst between these two populations in h <dig>  had no significant difference with the average fst value of the whole genome    <cit> . however, the drastic diversity pattern between domestic and wild pigs in the h <dig> gene body, which is a highly conserved region during large-scale evolution, suggests that this gene might have played roles in the breed differentiation of domestic pigs.

nucleotide diversity
we obtained all 2608 bp sequences in the h <dig> gene, including five exons and four introns from the published re-sequencing data of tibetan wild boars  <cit> , to identify the polymorphism sites in the gene. results showed that the 3’-region of the h <dig> gene has abundant polymorphisms. partial sequences of the h <dig> gene from 1660 bp to 2460 bp  were obtained from  <dig> pig individuals consisting of china native pigs and three foreign breeds to detect the roles of the h <dig> gene in breed differentiation. snp detection results of the h <dig> gene in different pig breeds are summarized in table  <dig>  additional file 1: tables s <dig>  s <dig> and figure s <dig>  the snp statistics table revealed eight snps in the region; of these snps, seven were observed only in domesticated pigs and one was present in both domesticated and wild pigs. however, clear differentiation of the genotype of this snp site was observed. the proportion of the t allele was higher than or equal to that of the c allele in wild pigs, but nearly all t alleles were observed in the tibetan wild boars. this result indicates that this site underwent differentiation in the wild pigs. among the chinese breeds, a number of populations were c-alleles homozygous, and other populations showed a particular frequency of t-alleles. at the population level, the snps were present in the heterozygous state, indicating that these sites have not been completely fixed. interestingly, the snp at 1818 bp exhibited a high mutation proportion in the cc and sc populations but was nearly completely homozygous in the other populations.table  <dig> snp detection of h19

estimates of nucleotide diversity  were consistently higher in pigs from cc  and sc  than in pigs from other locations, especially tibetan wild boars  . the same findings were observed for θ and θπ . such results suggest that genetic diversity increased during chinese pig differentiation, although no significant selection signal was detected through tajima’s d test  <cit> , fu and li’s h and d test  <cit>  or fay and wu’s h test  <cit>  . the results of hka test were also not significant . we constructed a neighbor-joining tree by using the net distance between populations and found that cc and sc clustered together . a considerable degree of mixture possibly decreased the selection signal.fig.  <dig> the neighbor-joining tree of h <dig> in different pig breeds. the neighbor-joining tree of h <dig> base on the net distance between breeds was constructed according to catalogs  and pig breeds  by mega  <dig> 



methylation analysis of the h <dig> gene between wild and domesticated pigs
we selected the dna immunoprecipitation  data of one tissue  of every pig sample and conducted pearson correlation test to test whether or not a significant difference exists between the mapping results of the whole genome and the h <dig> gene. pearson correlation coefficient ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  this result indicates that the mapping results are highly correlated on the basis of the pearson correlation coefficient. these results suggest that the result of whole genome mapping was consistent with that of h <dig> gene mapping after validation of the selected representative data. the methylation levels of the h <dig> gene body and linked upstream and downstream genomic regions were analyzed using the medip data of eight fat tissues and two muscle tissues of three tibetan pigs , landrace , and rongchang pig  to understand the methylation pattern of the h <dig> gene between wild and domesticated pigs . results showed that the methylation levels within the h <dig> gene among the three above mentioned pig breeds were lower than 6 kb upstream  and 6 kb downstream , whereas the methylation level was the highest in the 6 kb upstream region. several tissues, including the greater omentum  and mesentery adipose , from the rongchang pig showed significantly higher gene body methylation levels than the corresponding tissues in landrace  and tibetan pigs . several tissues showed distinct levels of methylation. in landrace, the methylation levels at both 6 kb upstream and 6 kb downstream regions in the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue , psoas major muscle , and retroperitoneal adipose tissue  were lower than those in other tissues, whereas the methylation levels in the upper lipid of back  were higher than those in other tissues . in the chinese native pig , the methylation levels were obviously higher in the gom and mad but lower in the asa, longissimus dorsi muscle , and pmm in all three regions . interestingly, the methylation levels at the upstream and downstream regions were clearly lower in the inner lipid of back  than in the gene body and other tissues of tibetan pigs . the methylation patterns in asa and pmm differed between chinese native pigs and tibetan pigs  .fig.  <dig> the methylation level of h <dig> in  <dig> tissues. the methylation level of upstream 6 kb , h <dig> gene body  and downstream 6 kb  of  <dig> tissues of landrace , rongchang  and tibetan  pigs according to the medip data. the number of reads which mapped to the reference sites represent the methylation level of sites



the methylation levels of the h <dig> gene and linked 2 kb upstream and downstream regions, as well as the expression levels in the liver, were determined and compared on the basis of our unpublished single-base liver methylome and transcriptome data of the wild boar , the chinese native pig , and a foreign breed  . the methylation levels of the gene were the lowest in the foreign pig , followed by that in the chinese wild pig . the methylation levels in the chinese native pig  were the highest at the 2 kb upstream region of the h <dig> gene . by contrast, the methylation levels in the gene body of landrace were higher than those in the two other samples . the expression levels of the h <dig> gene were the highest in the liver of foreign pigs , followed by those in the chinese wild pig and chinese native pig   . these results are consistent with the theory that methylation in the promoter region decreases expression levels and represses transcription noise in the gene body  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the methylation level and expression level of h <dig> in liver tissue. methylation level of upstream 2 kb , h <dig> gene body  and downstream 2 kb  of es , gzwb  and lb  and the expression level of h <dig> gene . the methylation level of every site was calculated by number of methylated reads divide number of total reads which was mapping to this site. the expression level was estimated by fpkm value which was calculated by cuffdiff software using transcriptome data. the grey horizontal lines below the a, b, c were the asm region, the vertical bars in a, b, c were dms, the different color represent dms between this pig breed and the other referred by the related color. 



we further explored the relation between imprinting and methylation difference. in this step, we identified the dmss among pig breeds and the asm region by using our unpublished single-base resolution methylome data of the liver from the three pig breeds. medip data were not in single base resolution; thus, we were unable to use the data to address tissue-specific methylated sites. we previously surveyed the methylation status of cpgs of the h <dig> gene in the three breeds. in the present study, we first identified the dmss among the three pig breeds by using chi-square test. we found a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dmss between the enshi pig and the guizhou wild pig, the guizhou wild pig and landrace, and the enshi pig and landrace, respectively, in which  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sites were in the upstream 2 kb region;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sites were in the gene body region; and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sites were in the downstream 2 kb region, respectively. this result indicates that dmss were mainly located in the upstream 2 kb region . we also identified regions with asm in each breed. we identified  <dig> asm regions, all of which were located in the upstream 2 kb region of the h <dig> gene. interestingly, all of these asm regions were in the enshi pig. in the  <dig> asm regions, no snp was found in the two other pig breeds; hence, we were unable to distinguish the allelic methylation status in these two breeds. we then used the enshi pig as a model to explore the dmss and asm of h <dig>  most of the dmss between the enshi pig and the other pigs were located in the asm region; specifically,  <dig> of  <dig> dmss between the enshi pig and the guizhou wild pig and  <dig> of  <dig> dmss between the enshi pig and landrace were situated in the asm region. our preliminary results imply that imprinting may be associated with methylation differences among different breeds.

discussion
increasing amounts of genomic sequence data and high-throughput annotation of genes have enabled the bioinformatics analysis of various genes of interest; this analysis has consequently provided important insights into the evolutionary link between genes of interest and particular phenotypic traits associated with several diseases  <cit> . as one of the first long non-coding imprinting genes to be described, h <dig> reportedly promotes skeletal muscle development and regeneration  <cit> . epigenetic studies have reported that abnormal methylation of the h <dig> gene may induce bws syndrome  <cit>  and influence fetal growth  <cit> . thus, the h <dig> gene is hypothesized to serve an important function in the evolution and breed differentiation of pigs.

to test this hypothesis, molecular evolution was first analyzed on a large scale by using the homologous h <dig> sequence of  <dig> species. the h <dig> gene was highly conserved in mammals. relative to the upstream and downstream regions, the h <dig> gene body was highly conserved, especially in the 5’-region of the gene body. the functional importance of the h <dig> gene was confirmed by the relatively large-scale evolutionary perspective observed.

molecular evolution analyses indicated a drastic divergence of diversity pattern between domestic and wild pigs. this finding is interesting because this region was highly conserved during large-scale evolution, suggesting that this region may have been under a strong evolutionary constraint. therefore, we suspected that the obviously increased diversity within the domestic pig population might be associated with breeding differentiation. further analyses within chinese domestic breeds showed that several snp genotypes within the h <dig> gene clearly differentiated among the different pig breeds, with the sc and cc types showing distinct genotypes compared with the others . although we were unable to associate their genotypes with their specific meat characters, our results provide a basis for further functional efforts on the alleles we identified. over all, the present results demonstrate that the h <dig> gene serve a critical function in pig breed differentiation and local adaptation. further functional significances on the different genotypes of this gene are needed to confirm.

h <dig> is an imprinted gene. only its maternal allele is expressed, and paternal alleles are imprinted in normal individuals. abnormal methylation of the h <dig> dmr located upstream of the h <dig> transcript start site induces abnormality and diseases . therefore, the potential epigenetic impact of h <dig> on pig domestication is an interesting issue. maximizing both the published medip data and the single-base bisulfite methylation data, we can obtain a general view of the epigenetic pattern on pigs. we found that the methylation levels within the gene body were relatively low and that tissue-specific methylation differences existed among different samples. furthermore, we obtained a precise pattern of h <dig> and successfully detected differential methylation associated with the differential expression of h <dig> on the basis of our unpublished single-base resolution methylome and transcriptome data of livers from three representative pig samples. chinese local breeds  showed the highest upstream methylation but the lowest downstream methylation. accordingly, h <dig> expression in es breeds drastically decreased compared with that in the wild boar and european breeds . promoter methylation in mammals and plants reportedly represses gene expression. the function of gene body methylation is intriguing, especially because gene body methylation may contribute to alternative gene expression  <cit> . during chinese pig domestication, a hyper-methylation of h <dig> occurred in the liver from its wild ancestor, which affected the repression of this gene. borensztein  <cit>  found that myod as a muscle source adjunction factor interacts with the h19/igf <dig> cluster to regulate myofiber differentiation and inferred that h <dig> participates in growth and muscle development  <cit> . a recent study has also concluded that h <dig> plays a crucial role in regulating skeletal muscle differentiation and generation mediated by mir-675-3p and mir-675-5p, which are encoded within h <dig> by knockdown of h <dig> in myoblast cells and knockout of h <dig> in mouse satellite cells, respectively  <cit> . thus, the inhibition of h <dig> expression can influence skeletal muscle differentiation. interestingly, epigenetic regulation on h <dig> in european pig breeds is another case. obvious de-methylation or hypo-methylation occurred in the promoter region in this breed compared with the two other breeds. specifically, dmss in the breed differential methylation were also identified. the methylation status of the h <dig> gene in its wild ancestor, the european wild boar, remains unknown; nevertheless, the present results clearly indicated a distinctively high expression of this gene in european pig breeds and thus suggested an opposite epigenetic regulation direction between chinese and european pig domestication. asm plays a crucial role in epigenetic phenomenon and parental imprinting  <cit> . in this study, consistent to the differential methylation sites between the enshi pig and the other breeds, all of these asm regions were identified in the 2 kb upstream region of the h <dig> gene in the enshi pig. our preliminary results implied that imprinting may be associated with methylation differences of h <dig> genes between pig breeds. both the differential methylation sites and asm in the upstream region may have important impact on gene expression and further functions. whether or not imprinting participated in epigenetic evolution during pig domestication and breed differentiation remains to be discusses in further research.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolution patterns of the h <dig> gene during pig domestication and breed differentiation were systematically analyzed at the genetic to epigenetic levels. the h <dig> gene was highly conserved during large-scale evolution and exhibited genotype differentiation during domestication and breed differentiation, especially in the cc and sc populations. epigenetic investigation showed that the h <dig> gene exhibited a specific methylation pattern and suggested an opposite epigenetic regulation direction between chinese and european pig domestication. this opposite epigenetic regulation direction resulted in opposite expression changes of this gene between the two domesticated groups. most dmss in the upstream 2 kb region were also located in the asm region, which implied a great relevance between imprinting and differential methylation. our results demonstrated the genetic and epigenetic patterns of h <dig> during pig domestication and provided valuable cues and basis for further research on the function of h <dig> in pig domestication.
