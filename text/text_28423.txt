BACKGROUND
stanniocalcins  represent a small family of secreted glycoprotein hormones consisting of stc <dig> and stc <dig> in which amino acid sequences are highly conserved among aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates  <cit> . however, the lack of homology with other known proteins has hampered the understanding of their functions. initial evidence suggested that mammalian stc <dig> would parallel the function of fish stc <dig>  which has been implicated in mineral homeostasis  <cit> . it is tempting to assume that the functions of stc <dig> and stc <dig> overlap at least in part, since they share high similarity in their primary amino acid sequence especially at the n-terminus and the pattern of cysteine residues is highly conserved  <cit> .

however, there are also several differences between stc <dig> and stc <dig>  including the fact that stc <dig> has  <dig> additional amino acids, the majority of which are located at its c-terminus  <cit> . furthermore their expression patterns are different <cit>  and stc <dig> is unable to displace stc <dig> from its putative receptor  <cit> , indicating that both molecules may have distinct receptors.

although stc <dig> functions as an anti-hypercalcemic hormone in fish  <cit> , it is becoming increasingly clearer that it may have expanded roles in mammals. such assumption is based on its wide expression pattern in adult normal tissues <cit> , tumors  <cit>  and also during embryogenesis  <cit> . further support for a complex function of stc <dig> in mammals comes from studies that show its varying sub-cellular localizations  <cit>  and of a gain-of-function phenotype observed in transgenic mouse  <cit> .

relatively little is also known about stcs molecular structure. the human and mouse genomes encode a  <dig> amino acid stc <dig> protein  <cit> . the first  <dig> amino acids show 92% sequence similarity to salmon stc <dig> and include a conserved n-linked glycosylation site of the type asn-x-thr/ser   <cit> . compared to the fish stc <dig> however, the last  <dig> residues at the c-terminus are poorly conserved in human stc <dig> , suggesting that the main biological activity of the stcs is mediated through its n-terminus  <cit> .

in ancient fish, the last conserved cysteine residue in the c-terminal of stc <dig>  which is supposedly involved in its dimerization, is replaced by arginine or histidine residues, thereby giving rise to a strictly monomeric form of the protein  <cit> . although dimeric forms of stc <dig> have been described  <cit> , answers to the question of its potential multimerization and modification to diverse higher molecular weight forms under certain circumstances remain elusive.

stc <dig> however, seems to exist in two different forms, the conventional dimeric  <dig> kda form, consisting of two ~ <dig> kda monomers, also known as stc <dig>  and a number of higher molecular weight stc variants, collectively referred to as "big stc"  <cit> . at least three molecular weights:  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda have been described and big stc <dig> has been reported to be expressed in adipocytes, adrenocortical cells  <cit>  and ovaries  <cit> . in order to explain the increased mass of big stc <dig> it has been suggested that either distinct post-translational modifications, including glycosylation  <cit>  or phosphorylation  <cit>  occur in big stc or additional but yet uncharacterized exons  <cit>  are being employed. in agreement with the latter, the monomeric form big stc <dig> is about ~ <dig> kda larger than the theoretically predicted monomer. another possibility is the formation of tri- , tetra-  or even pentamers  of stc <dig>  although in this case obtained values only add up for the theoretically predicted monomer  but not for that observed for the big stc monomer . it is however noteworthy that the 135-kda variant of big stc <dig> found in adrenocortical cells is resistant to chemical reduction, just like stc <dig> from the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> , thereby suggesting the formation of a more stable and maybe durable quaternary structure.

in this paper we present structural information about the human stc <dig> protein. we expressed human stc <dig> in insect cells using a bi-cistronic baculovirus construct. after affinity purification we collected saxs data for stc <dig> in solution. data analyses are indicative of a dimeric protein in solution. furthermore, we were able to confirm the formation of the conserved disulfide bridges, previously reported in fish stc <dig>  by mass spectrometry.

RESULTS
stc <dig> is predicted to be dimer and to possess a high content of alpha-helices
by analysing the human stc <dig> amino acid sequence using six different secondary structure prediction databases, we created a secondary structure consensus and scored it by the number of times  the predicted secondary structure element scored positive . prediction programs used were: predictprotein/prof  <cit> , psipred  <cit> , predator  <cit> , sopma  <cit> , sspro  <cit>  and jcfo  <cit> .

in summary, the secondary structure analysis suggested that about 34% of the amino acid sequence of stc <dig> may form alpha-helices.

we further performed some predictions about ordered or disordered regions within the sequence using foldindex  <cit>  and disembl  <cit> ) as well as globplot  <cit>  as a predictor for more globular regions . the first two programs both predicted that the pro-peptide region and possibly the c-terminal region, this last one which contains the cys disulfide mediated dimerization region, to be highly disorder or a region with high loop/turn content.

we analyzed and plotted  the conserved cysteine residues as well as the experimentally determined disulfide bridges from the salmon sequence determination  <cit> , the signal peptide, pro-peptide and mature protein sequence as annotated at uniprotkb/swiss-prot database , and we also emphasize a previously described nucleotide binding domain   <cit> .

additionally, some predictions about post-translational modifications were performed and compared to published experimental data. an n-glycosylation site which had already been characterized for stc <dig>  <cit>  was also predicted by netglyc  <cit>  

for phosphorylation analysis we combined prediction data from netphos  <cit>  and netphosk  <cit>  together with in vitro phosphorylation data  <cit>  to annotate tyrosine, threonine and serine residues as putative phosphorylation sites . most of the kinases that were found to phosphorylate stc <dig> by the in vitro phophorylation screening of jellinek and coworkers were predicted by both prediction programs , except calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  and casein kinase ii .

high score predictions of glycosylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation on stc <dig> sequence are presented. predicted modifications within the pro-peptide region were excluded. putative phosphorylated residues shown here are only those that were both predicted with the highest scores by the netphos server and additionally were predicted by netphosk, which suggests a specific kinase for the same site. references are related to additional experimental support for the predicted modification, if available. * indicate kinase as predicted by netphosk ; e = exposed residue, b = buried residue, nd = not determined; $ = unpublished data.

analysis by predictprotein/phd acc  <cit>  revealed that some of the residues such as s <dig> and t <dig>  are predicted to be exposed to the solvent and therefore more likely to suffer phosphorylation. indeed, both residues refer to stc <dig> kinase sites found to be phosphorylated by jellinek and co-workers  <cit> .

in order to screen for lysine residues predicted which may be sumoylated in stc <dig> we used sumoplot™  and found three putative sumoylated residues . the one having the highest score is located at the end of the nbd and the sumoylated residue  is also predicted by predictprotein/phd acc to be exposed to solvent. most interestingly, we found that stc <dig> interacted with the sumo <dig> protein in a yeast two hybrid screen . these data suggest that further experiments should be performed to test if sumoylation of stc <dig> may occur in vivo, in human cells.

optimization of the expression and purification of stc1
our first attempt to produce stc <dig> in e. coli using the ht-stc1Δnterm construct  resulted in completely insoluble expression . even splitting the protein in two halves using his-tag fusion did not make any difference in solubility, since both parts still expressed in insoluble form . only together with the use of gst-tag  we could obtain some soluble expression, however at very low amounts. the highest rate of soluble expression could be obtained with gst-c stc <dig> .

on the other hand, using a modified bi-cistronic vector of the baculovirus expression system we could obtain milligrams per liter of the soluble full-length his-tagged stc <dig>  secreted into the media . the amount of virus and of infected cells could be easily optimized, since the recombinant bi-cistronic baculo virus promotes production of endogenous gfp protein, turning infected cells green.

purification was obtained by a three step chromatography of the media: cation exchange followed by metal-affinity and size exclusion chromatographies . several milligrams of protein were routinely obtained per liter of culture supernatant and the obtained protein was used for subsequent experiments.

confirmation of disulfide bonds by mass-spectrometry
by analysing the recombinant human stc1-ht produced in the baculovirus system by esi/q-tof analysis we were able to identify and assign the peptides that resulted from enzymatic digestion either with trypsin or chymotrypsin in the oxidized and/or reduced forms . in brief, the data show the existence of peptides having mass compatible with the presence of the previously predicted disulfide bonds for the salmon stc <dig>  in table  <dig>  the first column gives the disulfide bridge in question and the last four columns give respectively the expected and experimentally determined peptide masses. in conclusion, all disulfide bridges except for one could be directly demonstrated. still cys45-cys <dig> could be evidenced indirectly, since the mass of the peptide shown in line one of table  <dig> is compatible with this interpretation. furthermore, after chemical digestion with formic acid, cys <dig> could be unambiguously assigned as the cys residue responsible for the dimerization of human stc <dig> .

samples were digested by trypsin or chymotrypsin with or without dithiotreitol and iodoacetamide, separated by uplc and analyzed by esi-qtof; or digested with formic acid and analyzed by maldi-qtof. the presented mass is the monoisotopic. dimer disulphide bond is indicated by asterisk  .

analysis of secondary structure
such a relatively high content predicted by in silico analysis  is supposed to be readily detected by circular dichroism spectroscopy of the protein, so the content of secondary structure elements in recombinant human stc1-ht was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy. figure  <dig> shows the spectrum of purified stc <dig> recorded at 4°c. purified protein presents negative ellipticity in the near-uv, with minima at  <dig>  and  <dig> nm . deconvolution of the cd spectrum lead to the following estimation of the content of secondary structural elements: ~52% of α-helices, ~19% of β-sheets strands, ~11% of turns and ~18% unordered  using the cdsstr algorithm on the dichroweb web server  <cit> . consensus predictions of secondary structures shown in figure  <dig> give values of about 37% of helix,  <dig> % of strands and  <dig> % of other structures . secondary structural predictors like psipred are based on neural networks trained on known folds, and thus tend routinely to underestimation of the true helical and strand content, due to the fact that the reference databases are not complete. a more critical issue is the fact that no other protein of the family of stcs has its structure resolved. in conclusion both the prediction and the experimentally determined data are in reasonable agreement, since they demonstrate a relatively high content of alpha-helices in human stc <dig> 

stc <dig> is a compact, slightly ellipsoidal dimer in solution
dynamic light scattering  data of the recombinant stc <dig> sample showed a single and narrow peak, which is an indicative of a monodisperse solution of dimers.

the corrected and normalized experimental saxs data are shown in figure 4a, together with the gnom curve fitting. the guinier region providing an rg value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å is shown in the inset. the p function resulting from these calculations is shown in figure 4b, with an inset showing the kratky representation of the intensity curve. the kratky plot indicates a slightly compact conformation for stc <dig> in solution. the maximum dimension  value obtained was  <dig> Å and the rg value, calculated from the p function, was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, in close agreement with that calculated from the guinier approximation. as it can be noted from the p function shape, stc <dig> has a slightly elongated shape.

using bsa as a reference sample, the molecular mass for stc <dig> ht, estimated from the saxs data, was ~ <dig> kda. this value is in agreement with the prediction of the protein being a dimer, since the theoretically calculated molecular mass of the monomer was ~ <dig> kda .

the dimerization was also confirmed both by mass spectrometry  and by size exclusion chromatography .

low resolution ab initio saxs-based models for stc1
the low resolution models for stc <dig> are presented in figure  <dig>  those models were derived from the experimental saxs data imposing a  <dig> point symmetry constraint . additional models calculated without symmetry constraint  presented very similar molecular envelopes. the calculated values of the normalized spatial discrepancy , which is an indicator of the difference between models, gave values of ~ <dig>  for p <dig> vs. p <dig> dammin models and ~ <dig>  for p <dig> vs. p <dig> gasbor models, suggesting a low discrepancy. in view of this result, all model calculations were performed using a  <dig> point symmetry constraint. after several runs performed with the program dammin, the averaged and filtered  dummy atom model for stc <dig> is shown in figure 5a. the nsd values for the set of  <dig> models ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which are considered reasonable values  <cit> . this low resolution model shows the expected elongated shape for the protein dimer. the most typical and recurrent dummy residue model resulting from the calculation with the program gasbor is shown in figure 5b. the nsd values for this set of  <dig> calculations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which are also quite reasonable. this last approach produced an improved molecular envelope for stc <dig>  comparing the results, both molecular envelopes obtained for stc <dig> presented a similar shape and confirmed the elongated conformation for the dimer.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provided the first low resolution 3d structure of human stc <dig> protein in solution. saxs experiments indicated that stc <dig> forms a dimer of slightly elongated shape in solution. circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the prediction of a high alpha-helical content and we could also confirm by mass spectrometry the highly conserved disulfide pattern, previously described in fish stc <dig> <cit> . disulfide bonds are formed between the same  <dig> of the  <dig> conserved cys, in the same fashion, leaving the c-terminal cys  <dig> free to engage in dimer formation. none of our data explain the composition or structure of "bigstc1" previously reported to appear in certain tissues  <cit> . indeed, our results only show the formation of dimers , by several independent methods. in human cells however, we may have additional contributions from possible post-translational modifications or alternative splice variants of the pre-mrna encoding stc <dig>  which may contribute to the appearance of the higher molecular weight forms. further experiments are required to characterize big stc <dig> at the molecular level and point out its differences with the canonical dimeric human stc <dig>
