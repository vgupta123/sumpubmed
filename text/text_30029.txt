BACKGROUND
plasmodium spp. are protozoan parasites  with a complex life cycle, including alternating development phases in mosquito and vertebrate hosts. more than a hundred plasmodium species have been described, of which four infect humans and cause malaria. the genome sequences of the most pathogenic human species, p. falciparum  <cit> , and of p. yoelii yoelii, a murine malaria species  <cit> , were published in  <dig>  sequencing of additional plasmodium species is underway. recently, the genome of cryptosporidium parvum another apicomplexan parasite has been published  <cit> , while the genome of toxoplasma gondii is being sequenced. the body of information available offers new opportunities in malaria research, and will hopefully accelerate rational design of novel intervention strategies, a pressing need in view of the rapidly deteriorating efficiency of existing control tools.

in recent years, our laboratory has explored the vaccine potential of the trophozoite protein r <dig>  a p. falciparum antigen exported by the parasite to the infected red blood cell membrane  <cit> . the protein contains a large central domain with  <dig> copies of a hk/msdh/sn consensus hexapeptide, encoded by the gene annotated as pfd1175w in the p. falciparum genome  <cit> . we have shown that a recombinant antigen called r <dig>  which contains  <dig> such repeats is the target of antibodies promoting phagocytosis of parasitized red blood cells  <cit>  and induces strong protective immunity against lethal infection in saimiri sciureus squirrel monkeys  <cit> . furthermore, the response to r <dig> repeats is associated with protection against clinical malaria in humans  <cit> . the pfd1175w gene sequence is well conserved among all isolates of p. falciparum studied so far. in order to obtain information on the organisational and expression constraints of the antigen, we carried out a comparative genomic approach. this showed that the n-terminal region and the central hexapeptide repeats were p. falciparum-specific and unique to pfd1175w. in contrast, multiple paralogs of the c-terminal region were identified in p. falciparum and a single ortholog in most other plasmodium species as well as in some distantly related apicomplexan species. this c-terminal region is predicted to be a protein kinase domain  <cit> , with high divergence from all other known kinase domains. we describe here some characteristics by this novel gene family and of this novel kinase domain, and discuss the possible relevance of species-specific gene amplification.

RESULTS
identification of r <dig> paralogs in p. falciparum
the r <dig> trophozoite protein  has a predicted three-exon structure, with a small  exon  <dig>  a large  exon  <dig> followed by a short  exon  <dig>  gene structure and exon / intron boundaries were experimentally confirmed by cdna sequencing . based on homology with pfd1175w, a gene family with  <dig> paralogs was identified in the genome of the 3d <dig> clone of p. falciparum. data mining indicated that all  <dig> paralogs are transcribed at a stage or another of the life cycle, and for many members at multiple stages   <cit> . twelve genes were re-annotated to fit with the gene structure and amino acid sequence of the other paralogs . all genes have a three exon structure with a large exon  <dig> flanked by two small exons, except mal7p <dig> , where the small exon  <dig> appears to be missing  . two paralogs  have an internal stop codon, reflecting pseudogenes or need for read through translation  <cit> .

the hallmark of the family is a conserved c-terminal domain showing  <dig> –  <dig> % identity among the paralogs, with its terminal  <dig> –  <dig> residues encoded by the small exon  <dig>  . this conserved domain has characteristic features of protein kinases, but can not be assigned to any known kinase family. the presence of all amino acids necessary for phosphotransfer except the canonical atp fixation motif gxgxxg in all  <dig> paralogs  suggests a novel protein kinase type. this is consistent with the conclusions of ward et al, who independently identified this protein kinase family, that was called fikk-kinase, using a whole genome search for protein kinases in p. falciparum  <cit> . two members contain a repeat region inserted between subdomains iii and iv consisting of  <dig> copies of the h k s/n d n/h/s n hexapeptide in pfd1175w and of  <dig> copies of the two amino acid motif ne/g in pfi <dig>  the other family members contain a stretch of up to  <dig> non-conserved and non-repeated amino acids in this region, as illustrated in figure  <dig> 

contrasting with the conserved c-terminal kinase domain, the n-terminal region is unique to each paralog, with less than 20% identity and substantial size variation . homology and motif searches for each unique n-terminal region did not identify any known pfam domain or a significant homology with any other p. falciparum protein. however, all twenty paralogs contain a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids within the first  <dig> amino acids, corresponding to a predicted trans-membrane or signal sequence for  <dig> members according to plasmodb. analysis of the re-annotated paralogs using an improved signal peptide prediction algorithm  <cit>  and manual curation identified a likely signal / anchor sequence in all but one paralogs . for pfi0100c, there was no signal / anchor sequence probability but there was a trans-membrane prediction. we considered here as a possible signal / anchor sequence that might have escaped detection by the algorithms used. the secretion motif rxsrilaexxx identified recently  <cit>  was present in six paralogs . interestingly however, the shorter plasmodium export element  identified independently by marti et al  <cit>  was detected in all paralogs downstream of the signal / anchor sequence  . the consensus  ×  ×  pentamer was observed in  <dig> paralogs. a non-canonical amino acid in the fifth position was found in pfi0095c and pfi00105c . the pexel motif is located 16– <dig> amino acids downstream of the start of the second exon, except in mal7p <dig> , where it is  <dig> residues downstream of the signal sequence. pf11_ <dig> has two putative pexel motifs located at positions 20– <dig> and 44– <dig> 

r45-fikk kinase orthologs in other plasmodium species and in other apicomplexans
orthologs were identified in most plasmodium genome sequences available to date. a single copy gene was observed in the human species p. vivax , the simian species p. knowlesi , the murine species p.y. yoelii  and p. berghei , and the avian species p. gallinacaeum . in contrast, six paralogs were identified in p. reichenowi . no ortholog was identified in the murine species p. chabaudi, possibly reflecting the low coverage  of the available genome sequence.

the deduced protein sequence alignment showed the fikk-protein kinase domain to be well conserved within the genus . none of the non p. falciparum orthologs identified here contain any repeat region. based on their kinase domain, the r45-fikk kinase proteins from six plasmodium species, namely pvr <dig>  pkr <dig>  pyr <dig>  pbr <dig>  pgr <dig> and prr45- <dig>  clustered perfectly in a phylogenetic tree with  <dig> –  <dig> % identity , suggesting that they derive from the same common ancestor. intriguingly, no p. falciparum r45-like protein was observed in this cluster. the best match, pf10_ <dig>  showed a non-significant bootstrap of  <dig>  the six r45-like orthologs of the core cluster are quite distinct from the p. falciparum r45-fikk genes with regard to their gene structure and n-terminal region  . they have a two exon structure. the short, highly conserved second exon is the ortholog of the conserved third p. falciparum exon. all genes lack an ortholog of the first p. falciparum exon and hence encode a protein without a signal sequence and a pexel motif. in addition, the n-terminal region is much larger than for any p. falciparum paralog, ranging from  <dig> residues in pkr <dig> to  <dig> residues in prr45- <dig>  interestingly, analysis of the n-terminal region identified pairs of orthologs, with  <dig> % identity between pvr <dig> and pkr <dig>  and  <dig> % identity between pyr <dig> and pbr <dig> . these pairs form two quite separate homology groups, with less than  <dig> % overall inter-group identity. despite of the low overall conservation, stretches of conserved amino acids are present within the  <dig> downstream residues of the n-terminal region . these motifs are not observed in any p. falciparum ortholog .

p. reichenowi, like p. falciparum, has multiple r45-fikk kinase paralogs. as indicated above, prr45- <dig>  clusters with the orthologs from the single copy species and does not have an ortholog in the 3d <dig> p. falciparum genome. interestingly however, the five other p. reichenowi paralogs could each be attributed to a specific p. falciparum r45-fikk kinase paralog , forming orthologous pairs as follows: prr45- <dig> – pf10_ <dig>  prr45- <dig> – pfi <dig>  prr45- <dig> – mal7p <dig> , prr45- <dig> – pfc <dig>  prr45- <dig> – pfi <dig>  for those p. reichenowi paralogs were enough sequence data was available, there was remarkable conservation of both the kinase domain  and the n-terminal region . interestingly, the two p. reichenowi orthologs with full length sequence available, prr45- <dig> and prr45- <dig>  share the  <dig> exon structure with their p. falciparum orthologs, have an exon 1-encoded signal sequence and a conserved pexel sequence close to the start of exon  <dig>  progress in the p. reichenowi genome should indicate whether or not the other orthologs present the same structure so far observed only in p. falciparum and p. reichenowi.

a single copy r45-like ortholog was identified in t. gondii  as well as in c. parvum , two parasite species that belong to a distinct class, namely coccidea, within the phylum apicomplexa. their deduced amino acid sequence is quite divergent from the plasmodium spp. family members . the protein kinase domain of cpr <dig> and tgr <dig> shows  <dig> –  <dig> % and  <dig> –  <dig> % identity, respectively, with the cluster of orthologs. the lower value for tgr <dig> is explained by insertions of stretches of amino acids between some subdomains. the gene structure of tgr <dig> and cpr <dig> differs considerably from their orthologs in the various plasmodium spp. tgr <dig> is encoded by a minimum of seven exons, with possible additional upstream exons. while the seventh exon corresponds to the third exon of the p. falciparum paralogs, the remaining kinase domain is encoded by six exons. a signal sequence is predicted within the first  <dig> amino acids of tgr <dig>  but not followed by a pexel motif. the significance of this finding is unclear, because the actual start of the tgr45coding region is not yet identified. in contrast, in line with the general paucity of introns in the c. parvum genome, cpr <dig> is encoded by a single exon  <cit> . the c-terminal amino acids encoded by a specific exon in all the other orthologs are present and well conserved in cpr <dig> 

chromosome localisation in p. falciparum
the  <dig> p. falciparum paralogs are distributed over  <dig> chromosomes. interestingly,  <dig> of  <dig> r45-fikk kinase paralogs are located within  <dig> kb from their telomer, all with the sense of transcription directed towards the telomer . seven of these paralogs are single copy on their respective chromosome. a cluster of seven head to tail parologs is located on chromosome  <dig>  and two paralogs are separated by a single gene on chromosome  <dig>  chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have two paralogs, one in the sub-telomeric region and one in the central region. chromosome  <dig> has a single centrally located gene.

interestingly, the subtelomeric r45-fikk kinase paralogs are consistently associated with paralogs from other multigene families with a predominant subtelomeric localisation. the most frequent association  is with the ortholog group named  <dig>  which contains proteins with a dna j domain, in particular, the ring erythrocyte surface antigens . there seems to be a close association between both families as in most cases the  <dig> paralog is the closest or the next closest gene to a r45-fikk paralog. for instance, pfd1165w and pfd1175w, which are located  <dig> kb from the chromosome  <dig> telomer, are each flanked in 3' by a  <dig> paralog. likewise, pf11_ <dig> is located between the resa <dig> and resa <dig> paralogs on chromosome  <dig>  pfa0130c is located further apart from resa <dig>  but still is closely linked . approximately half of the  <dig> paralogs within the  <dig> group are localised close to a r45-fikk kinase gene. additional subtelomeric gene families in the close vicinity of a r45-fikk paralog include the  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  as well as several multigene families coding for hypothetical transmembrane proteins . there are several examples of specific tandem arrangements such as resa, r45-like, eba , suggesting an ancient higher order organisation.

c. parvum is the only other apicomplexan for which chromosome maps have been established  <cit> . cpr <dig>  is located approx.  <dig> kb from the putative telomer on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , but does not seem to be associated with any specific subtelomeric family. in p.y. yoelii, the r45-fikk ortholog is not present in a subtelomeric or telomeric contig  <cit> , but the exact chromosomal localisation is unfortunately neither known for this species nor for other plasmodium species, since at this stage of genome annotation and assembly, chromosome maps are quite incomplete. a partial synteny map has been established for some regions of the p.y. yoelii and p. falciparum chromosomes. interestingly enough, many r45-fikk kinase paralogs lie at the boundary of the subtelomeric region where both species diverge substantially and as such correspond to breakpoint in synteny. we looked systematically for p.y. yoelii orthologs in the vicinity of the various r45-fikk kinase paralogs. we observed break of synteny close to all telomeric paralogs, confirming observations by other authors  <cit> . in particular the synteny reported for the p.y. yoelii chromosome  <dig> and p. falciparum  <dig> stops close to the localisation of pfd1165w  <cit> . we also observed breaks of synteny close to internal r45-fikk paralogs, in particular downstream of the internal gene mal7p <dig> , and upstream and downstream of pf10_ <dig>  we could not explore the vicinity of mal13p <dig> , which is still uncertain. interestingly, the p. vivax contig that harbours pvr <dig> also contains a break in synteny with p. falciparum.

discussion
the family identified here on the basis of similarity with the non repeated regions from pfd1175w groups genes coding for a well conserved c-terminal protein kinase domain. recently, ward et al identified the same family using a whole genome mining for protein kinases. based on a conserved motif from sub-domain ii, they named this family "fikk-like kinase"  <cit> . since the kinase activity has not been formally demonstrated, and since the only paralog characterised in some detail so far is r <dig>   <cit> , we prefer to name it the r45-fikk kinase family.

the r45-fikk family was observed only in protozoan parasites of the phylum apicomplexa. a single copy gene was detected in most species except in p. falciparum and its closest relative p. reichenowi, where multiple copies were observed. as current genome coverage is ≥ 10× for c. parvum  <cit> , p. vivax and t. gondii, 5× for p. yoelii  <cit>  and p. knowlesi, the conclusion of a low  copy number is a fair statement. due to incomplete coverage of the p. berghei, p. gallinacaeum and p. chabaudi genome sequence , a definitive conclusion on the actual copy number in these species cannot be drawn, but a large copy number is highly unlikely. conversely, copy number in p. reichenowi may be underestimated. indeed, six copies have been detected in the available p. reichenowi sequence, currently only at  <dig> × coverage. additional copies might be uncovered upon completion of genome sequence.

the kinase domain is well conserved in all family members identified. it has many features of a catalytic protein kinase domain. the limited homology with well characterised kinase domains from other species precludes predicting a possible kinase type and phosphorylation target. this is in line with the observation that protozoan parasites such as plasmodium spp., t. gondii and c. parvum have a quite different kinase repertoire as compared to yeast and metazoa  <cit> . the fact that all residues essential for phosphotransfer are present in each kinase domain of the r45-fikk kinase family suggests that these proteins function as protein kinases. these observations call for experimental investigation of the potential enzymatic activity of the r45-like proteins, the uniqueness of which could represent an attractive drug or vaccine target.

the n-terminal region is much less conserved than the kinase domain but interestingly, clear ortholog pairs with very good conservation were identified. clustering of the two rodent species p. berghei and p. yoelii, of the human p. vivax and simian p. knowlesi and of p. falciparum and p. reichenowi is in line with the phylogeny inferred from rrna and csp gene sequences  <cit> . the n-terminal domain of the r45-fikk kinases may thus serve as a sensitive marker for genetic distance within the plasmodium genus.

the conservation of the c-terminal fikk-kinase domain and the restricted conservation of the n-terminal domain points to a hybrid gene, with individual components evolving at distinct rates. evolution of the kinase domain may be constrained in order to retain enzymatic activity. in contrast, the high divergence of n-terminal regions among r45-like protein orthologs in distant species might reflect different  interaction partners and / or their possible implication in distinct biological processes or distinct stages of the life cycle. the sequence variation between the various p. falciparum and p. reichenowi paralogs is another sign of the rapid evolution of this gene family. the observation that none of the  <dig> p. falciparum r45-fikk kinase genes clustered with the "core" group of orthologs from the other plasmodium species may be related to this rapid divergence rate. alternatively, it may merely reflect absence of this family member from the 3d <dig> genome, which presents several large sub-telomeric deletions and may lack the "core" ortholog. the ongoing sequencing of additional p. falciparum lines will clarify this issue.

pfd1175w, the trophozoite protein r <dig> that led us initiate this analysis, turned out to be a quite unusual family member in that it contains a large repeat region absent from all other r45-like proteins. pfd1175w clusters with the orthologous pair prr45- <dig> – pf10_ <dig>  suggesting that it originates from duplication of the latter after speciation, and has subsequently acquired the repeat region. this is the first evidence of such a process in malaria parasites. pfi0125c, which also contains a specific repeat region, clusters with a different p. reichenowi paralog, namely prr45- <dig>  both prr45- <dig> and prr45- <dig> are devoid of repeats. thus, in both cases, acquisition of repeats was p. falciparum-specific and posterior to the p. reichenowi /p. falciparum branching. interestingly, the repeats are anchored within a gene region that shows substantial intra-family sequence polymorphism. this gene family thus represents a unique opportunity to analyse the genesis and possible evolution of these intriguing low complexity sequences in p. falciparum parasites. indeed, we have observed considerable variation in the copy number of the pfd1175w hexapeptide repeats in field isolates .

p. falciparum and p. reichenowi present an expanded set of r45-fikk kinase genes, which furthermore have unique structural features. the genes have a three exon structure and encode a protein with canonical export signatures . this was observed in all twenty p. falciparum paralogs and in the p. reichenowi paralogs for which full length coding sequence could be retrieved. no such export signature was observed in any of the other orthologs from the family. presence of a signal sequence associated with a downstream pexel motif is necessary and sufficient for exportation of the protein beyond the parasitophorous vacuole  <cit> . this suggests that all  <dig> p. falciparum paralogs have the capacity to be exported beyond the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. the available mrna expression profiling indicates that all  <dig> paralogs are transcribed by blood stages and that seven are also transcribed in sporozoites  <cit> . evidence for protein expression was obtained for some paralogs by mass spectroscopy at the trophozoite and / or sporozoite stage  <cit> . absence of protein detection must be interpreted with caution, because it may reflect low abundance of the protein in question at the developmental stage investigated. pfd1175w, the only paralog characterised to date is exported to the red blood cell membrane at the early trophozoite stage  <cit> . immunisation of saimiri monkeys with a recombinant protein derived from its central repeat region resulted in either complete protection or in selection of parasite mutants that no longer expressed red blood cell surface variant antigens  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that the r <dig> trophozoite antigen is involved in some sort of signalling cascade, and by extrapolation that the other family members are implicated in signalling from the extracellular / extravacuolar milieu as well.

interestingly, most p. falciparum r45-fikk kinase paralogs are located in the subtelomeric regions that harbour numerous multigene families that code for proteins destined to be exported to the host cellular membrane or host cytoplasm  <cit> . the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of plasmodium spp. harbour several multigene families that code for products involved in antigenic variation  <cit> . remarkably enough, these multigene families differ markedly in p. falciparum as compared to p.y. yoelii  <cit> . nine telomeric / subtelomeric multigene families have been identified in p.y. yoelii. four of them, namely the yir or vir or the pystb-d families have no ortholog in the 3d <dig> genome, while the others are either expanded or contracted as compared to p. falciparum  <cit> . similarly, the telomeric var, rif and stevor p. falciparum multigene families do not have orthologs in p.y. yoelii  <cit>  or p. vivax  <cit> . our observation of a markedly different copy number of r45-fikk kinase genes in p. falciparum as compared to p.y. yoelii or p. vivax is in line with distinct sets of subtelomeric multigene families in different plasmodium species. this is further substantiated by the observation that the p. falciparum r45-fikk kinase genes are situated at or close to subtelomeric breakpoints of synteny between p. falciparum and p. yoelii  <cit> . the association of most r45-fikk kinase telomeric paralogs with a dna j / resa paralog and with additional paralogs from families coding for exported hypothetical membrane proteins or proteins involved in lipid metabolism suggests a structured complex interacting with and signalling from the host cell membrane. it is possible that different subtelomeric gene families execute this function in species such as such as p. vivax, p. knowlesi or p.y. yoelli that do not possess the specific adhesion properties associated with expression of erythrocyte variant antigens observed in p. falciparum.

CONCLUSIONS
the new r45-fikk kinase gene family codes for hybrid proteins with a variable n-terminal domain associated with a conserved, novel protein kinase domain. the presence of most key amino acids for phosphotransfer and the remarkable sequence conservation suggest an enzymatic function. the restricted occurrence of r45-like genes in apicomplexan parasites and the distance from known kinase families makes a case for consideration of this family as a potential drug or vaccine target. the family shows considerable expansion in p. falciparum. all paralogs code for proteins with canonical export signals and most are subtelomeric, clustered with a subset of multigene families coding for exported proteins. this suggests that expansion of this family might contribute to p. falciparum virulence.
