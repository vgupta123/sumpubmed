BACKGROUND
fleshy fruit ripening is a complex developmental process, that typically involves changes in texture, color and flavor  <cit> . the regulatory mechanisms underlying these changes, and that coordinate the up- or down-regulation of large numbers of genes, include many ripening-related transcription factors , fruit-related micrornas that target some of these tfs, dna methylation and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . members of several families of tfs, such as the mads-box, myb, ap2/erf and sbp/spl families, participate in the transcriptional regulatory network that modulates ripening  <cit> . for example, studies of several ripening-related mutants of the fleshy fruit model species tomato   <cit> , including ripening inhibitor   <cit> , non-ripening   <cit>  and colorless non-ripening   <cit> , resulted in the identification of several ripening-associated tfs. the genes corresponding to these loci were found to encode fruit ripening related tfs, which have subsequently been identified as components of the transcriptional activation cascade that coordinates ripening  <cit> . other tf families that participate in fruit ripening, included myb, ap2/ethylene response factor , hd-zip, basic helix-loop-helix  and auxin response factors   <cit> . for example, slmyb <dig> from tomato and mdmyb <dig> from apple have been shown to influence flavonoid and anthocyanin accumulation during fruit ripening  <cit> , and a member of the ap2/erf family, ap2a, which acts downstream of rin, nor, and cnr, is a negative regulator of tomato ripening  <cit> . in addition, silencing of lehb <dig>  which encodes a tomato putative hd-zip protein, led to delayed ripening and reduced expression leaco <dig>  a gene that encodes an acc oxidase, which is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the ripening associated hormone ethylene  <cit> . moreover, members of both bhlh and arf families have been shown to play diverse roles in fruit development and ripening  <cit> .

while various families of tfs are clearly associated with ripening regulation, there has been no such connection established for the large nuclear factor y  tf family, despite its known functions in regulating plant growth, development, and abiotic or biotic stress responses  <cit> . nf-y tfs, which are also known as heme activator proteins  or ccaat binding factors , can be categorized as nf-ya , nf-yb  and nf-yc  proteins  <cit> , and they have been shown to bind to ccaat boxes, which are thought to be present in approximately 30% of eukaryotic promoters  <cit> . the nf-yb proteins lack a nuclear localization signal , and depend on an interaction with nf-yc proteins to ensure translocation to the nucleus. upon arrival in the nucleus, a heterotrimer is formed, comprising the nf-yb and nf-yc heterodimer and nf-ya, which can bind to ccaat boxes in the promoters or other regions of target genes,  <cit> .

in order to investigate the potential functions of nf-y tfs in fruit ripening, we evaluated a total of  <dig> tomato nf-y genes using a combination of bioinformatic analyses, and high-throughput functional screening, using virus-induced gene silencing   <cit> ; an approach that has been widely used to study tomato fruit development and ripening  <cit> . we also describe a phylogenetic analysis of nf-y genes from arabidopsis thaliana and tomato, and an investigation of their chromosomal distribution, protein motif and exon/intron structure patterns. as a result of these analyses, we propose five candidate nf-y genes that are likely involved in fruit ripening regulation.

RESULTS
identification, organization and structure of tomato nf-y genes
a search of the plant transcription factor database  revealed a total of fifty-nine predicted tomato nf-y genes that, based on the encoded subunits, included ten nf-ya, twenty-nine nf-yb and twenty nf-yc genes . the physical map positions of the nf-y genes on the tomato chromosomes were identified , according to their ascending order of physical position , from the short arm telomere to the long arm telomere. of the fifty-nine nf-y genes, fifty-seven could be mapped onto the twelve tomato chromosomes, with the exceptions being solyc00g <dig> and solyc00g <dig>  chromosome  <dig> contained three nf-ya genes, while chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> did not contain any genes from this sub-group. chromosome  <dig> contained the largest number of nf-yb genes, seven, almost all of which were located in the upper part of the chromosome. a total of ten nf-y genes were located on chromosome  <dig>  chromosome  <dig> had the largest number of nf-yc genes, six. it appears that the pattern of nf-y genes across plant genomes is uneven and that the distribution varies among different species. for example, in common bean , pvnf-y genes were mapped to  <dig> out of the  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  and the nine pvnf-ya genes were uniformly distributed, while five of the psnf-yb genes were located on chromosome  <dig>  moreover, members of the pvnf-yc subfamily were found on five chromosomes, with one or two per chromosome  <cit> .table  <dig> nf-y transcription factors in tomato

we next analyzed the exon-intron structure of the tomato nf-y genes . the nf-ya genes had four to seven exons, and most  had one or two exons. however, the structure of the nf-yc genes was more variable and thirteen out of twenty had one or two exons, while others had three to six exons, and one nf-yc gene, solyc02g <dig>  had twenty-two exons. overall, the gene structure analysis revealed that the members of the nf-ya family had a relatively consistent intron/exon organization , while the nf-yb and nf-yc sub-groups were more variable among different members, which is similar to the organization reported for common bean nf-y genes  <cit> .

multiple alignment of nf-y protein sequences and analysis of the evolutionary relationship between tomato and a. thaliana families
multiple sequence alignments were generated of proteins corresponding to members of the tomato and a. thaliana nf-y subunit family . the a. thaliana nf-y family was comprised of ten atnf-ya, thirteen atnf-yb and fourteen atnf-yc proteins. each sub-family was found to have one or more central core regions with extensive homologous motifs , that have been reported to be important in subunit interactions and dna binding in yeast and mammals  <cit> . the motifs of the tomato nf-y proteins with putative functions in protein interactions and dna binding were highlighted using the interpro protein sequence analysis and classification database . finally, an un-rooted phylogenetic tree was created using the full length tomato and a. thaliana nf-y protein sequences in order to gain insight into their evolutionary relationships and to assist with functional predictions .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of tomato and a. thaliana nf-y proteins. phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> nf-y proteins from tomato  and a. thaliana . four branches were formed corresponding to genes with different subunits. pink represents two branches of nf-yc, blue represents nf-yb and yellow represents nf-ya



the tomato and a. thaliana nf-ya proteins were variable in length, ranging from 154- <dig> and 186- <dig> amino acids , respectively , and they were observed to share two characteristic conserved domains . previous studies with metazoans and yeast have indicated that the first twenty aa conserved domain is required for subunit interactions with nf-yb/yc, and that the other  <dig> aa domain is necessary for dna binding and ccaat sequence recognition specificity  <cit> . outside the conserved regions, there was limited aa sequence conservation; however, the sequences were generally rich in gln  and ser/thr  residues, a feature that has been associated with promoting transcriptional activation  <cit> . all the tomato nf-ya proteins contained predicted nuclear localization signals that were similar to those of the a. thaliana homologs .fig.  <dig> expression patterns of nf-y genes in various tomato organs. rna-seq expression data corresponding to fifty-nine tomato nf-y genes were retrieved from the genome consortium  datasets  <cit>  for further analysis. twelve genes with no detectable transcripts in any tissue/organ were excluded from the heat map. in the heat map, the rpkm  values were transformed to log <dig>  thirteen genes are shown labeled with their subunit on the right corresponding to genes targeted for subsequent analysis. the expression in various tomato organs is shown, including bud, flower, leaf, root, f_1cm , f_2cm, f_3cm, mg , b , b <dig> 



the nf-yb proteins from tomato and a. thaliana ranged from 86- <dig> and 139-  <dig> aa in length, respectively . they were highly similar in a stretch of more than  <dig> aas that is considered to be the central conserved domain involved in the interaction with the nf-yc and nf-ya subunits and dna binding . outside this central region, the sequences were variable in both length and aa composition. evolutionary analysis can be used to predict the function of members from the same clade based on the known function of one or more members of that clade. for example, atnf-yb <dig> from a. thaliana, also known as lec1-like , is a regulator of embryo development, and l1l rna accumulates in developing embryos  <cit> . the tomato l1l paralogs, l1l <dig> to l1l <dig>  have similar expression patterns in either seed or developing fruit, or both, and may therefore have a similar function  <cit> .

the nf-yc sub-group contained a central domain of approximately  <dig> aas that was highly conserved across the different members, and which has been shown to be important for both dna binding and interactions between nf-y subunits   <cit> . most nf-yc proteins were enriched in q residues , a feature that has previously been noted in a. thaliana  <cit> , brachypodium distachyon  <cit>  and other plant species  <cit> . in mammals and yeast, the q rich regions of nf-yc proteins have been reported to function in transcriptional activation  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis identified two main clades, one containing atnf-yc <dig> and four tomato nf-yc proteins, and another containing thirteen atnf-yc and sixteen tomato nf-yc proteins . such gene structure analysis can often provide additional information regarding putative gene function  <cit>  and here it was noted that three pairs of tomato nf-y genes in the same clade had the same number of exons .

expression patterns of nf-y genes in different tomato organs and during fruit development
tomato transcript expression  data sets are publicly available, including expression in  <dig> tomato organ types: bud, flower, leaf, root, and fruit with 1 cm, 2 cm or 3 cm diameters, and at the mature green, breaker, breaker + 10 days stages of development and ripening  <cit> . these datasets were searched using the fifty-nine tomato nf-y gene sequences and the results were used to construct a hierarchical clustering heat map  displaying the expression patterns of forty-seven of the fifty-nine nf-y genes. the other twelve nf-y genes did not have any corresponding expression data and so were omitted from the analysis. among remaining forty-seven observed nf-y genes, more than half had low levels of transcripts, and these were enriched in top part of the heat map . specific nf-y genes such as solyc12g <dig> were more abundantly expressed in buds and flowers, but much lower transcript levels in fruit. in this study, we focused on nf-y genes with relatively higher expressions in fruit during development and ripening, so thirteen members, comprising four nf-ya, four nf-yb and five nf-yc genes, were selected for further functional analysis , which was also labeled with corresponding subunit in the heat map .table  <dig> list of tomato nf-y candidate regulators for fruit ripening

quantitative rt-pcr analysis of nf-y gene expression in ripening tomato fruit and their responsiveness to ethylene and 1-mcp
based on the rna-seq expression profile analysis, thirteen tomato nf-y genes were selected as candidates for fruit ripening regulation and their expression was further evaluated by real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis at different fruit developmental stages: immature , mature green , breaker , pink  and red ripe . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the genes collectively displayed a range of expression patterns during ripening, and the changes in expression were in agreement with the rna-seq profiles, other than extent of the changes for a couple of the genes. the expression patterns of some genes, such as solyc11g <dig> , solyc09g <dig> , solyc01g <dig> and solyc01g <dig> , were consistent with a role in promoting ripening since they showed up-regulated expression at onset of ripening. others, such as solyc03g <dig>  showed reduced expression during ripening, and solyc01g <dig>  was down-regulated after the onset of ripening, although its expression increased at the bk stage, which might indicate a role in suppressing ripening. two nf-y genes showed a fluctuating expression patterns during development, including solyc06g <dig>  and solyc01g <dig> , although the pattern were opposite from each other. other genes, including solyc08g <dig> , solyc07g <dig> and solyc11g <dig> , solyc06g <dig> and solyc06g <dig>  showed minor changes once ripening had initiated.fig.  <dig> expression of tomato nf-y genes during fruit ripening. figures are grouped into  nf-ya,  nf-yb,  nf-yc. relative transcript levels are shown, as determined by quantitative real time rt-pcr, relative to the expression of the tomato actin gene, expressed as 2-△△ct  <cit> . the stages of fruit ripening were: immature , mature green , breaker , pink , and red ripe . significance values were based on comparisons of expression levels at different ripening stages with expression at the im stage. expression levels of the tomato acs <dig> gene were used as a positive control. lowercase letters above the bars indicate values with a significant difference, which were determined by student’s t-test 



to examine the ethylene responsiveness of these nf-y genes, their expression levels were monitored in tomato fruits treated with ethylene or the ethylene receptor inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene . specifically, the expression of thirteen candidate ripening related nf-y genes was evaluated in fruit that were harvested at the mg stage and then treated with ethylene or 1-mcp for 24 h, using quantitative rt-pcr analysis. expression of an ethylene-inducible gene, acs <dig> increased in the ethylene treated fruits, and was suppressed in the 1-mcp treated fruits compared with the control , thereby confirming the induction or inhibition of ethylene signaling by the treatment. the treatment also significantly increased the expression of eleven nf-y genes , while the expression of solyc01g <dig> showed no significant change at the mg stage when treated with ethylene or 1-mcp , and the expression of solyc07g <dig> declined after treatment with 1-mcp but was not significantly affected by the exogenous ethylene , which was in accordance with the flat trend during ripening . solyc03g <dig> was the only gene of those tested whose expression was induced by ethylene and decreased to 1-mcp. this pattern was unexpected as we observed that the expression of solyc03g <dig> decreases during tomato ripening .fig.  <dig> expression of tomato nf-y genes in fruit treated with ethylene or 1-mcp. figures are grouped into  nf-ya,  nf-yb,  nf-yc. fruit at the mg stage and after 24 h of treatment with ethylene or 1-mcp. fruits harvested at the mg stage and treated with air for 24 h were used as a control. the change in relative transcript levels of genes in fruits treated with ethylene or 1-mcp are shown, determined by quantitative real time rt-pcr as described above. asterisks indicate values with a significant difference as determined by student’s t-test 



trv-mediated vigs of nf-y genes affects tomato fruit ripening
we next investigated the functions of the thirteen ripening regulator candidates using trv-mediated virus induced gene silencing , an effective tool to down-regulate gene expression  <cit>  that has proven useful for gene functional characterization in tomato fruits  <cit> . except for two pairs of genes , which were highly homologous and therefore shared the same gene fragment in the vigs vector, gene specific fragments of each gene, ranging from 400 bp to 500 bp, were selected for vigs plasmid construction. as a result, a total of  <dig> specific recombinant plasmids and one positive ptrv <dig> vector carrying a truncated phytoene desaturase  gene fragment were used for the vigs experiments.

approximately ten days after infiltration of the fruit stalk with mixed agrobacterium strain gv <dig> containing ptrv <dig> and ptrv <dig> or one of the twelve recombinant vectors , fruits of the infiltrated plants developed an uneven coloring, which was visible for several days. as expected  <cit> , the pds gene-silenced fruit  displayed a photo-bleached phenotype, which led to a partial yellow coloring of the fruits at the red colored stages . silencing of  <dig> nf-y genes  resulted in patchy coloring of the fruit with areas exhibiting different shades of yellow, orange or pink . in order to ensure the efficiency of the vigs, the presence of the virus and gene transcript levels were determined . we observed that mrna levels of solyc01g <dig>  solyc06g <dig> and solyc08g062210/solyc11g <dig> in the yellow colored areas were reduced by approximately 85 %, 30 %, 35 % and 37 %, respectively, compared with the orange tissues, which suggested that the expression of these genes was upregulated during ripening. in contrast, the mrna levels of solyc07g <dig> in the red regions were much lower than in the yellow regions , indicating a role in suppressing ripening. finally, silencing of solyc01g <dig>  solyc06g <dig> and solyc07g <dig>  resulted in delayed ripening at earlier stages, with a subsequently restored red phenotype at later stages. only the fruits of plants infiltrated with ptrv2-t2210/t <dig>  which silenced solyc08g062210/solyc11g <dig>  displayed patchy coloring until the red ripe stage , which may indicate that simultaneous silencing of these two genes strengthens the effect of the vigs.fig.  <dig> trv-mediated virus induced gene silencing  of genes in tomato fruit. the inflorescence peduncles attached to the fruit were injected with agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with trv alone, or with ptrv <dig> carrying a fragment of a target gene. a ptrv-pds,  ptrv2-solyc08g062210/solyc11g <dig>   ptrv2-solyc06g <dig>   ptrv2-solyc07g <dig>   ptrv2-solyc01g <dig>  silencing of the target gene led to a decrease in gene expression, and different fruit color phenotypes compared with plants that were transformed with the empty vector control, which displayed normal ripening fruits . rna was extracted from the control and the red and yellow areas of the gene-silenced tomato fruits. after reverse transcription, both the control and silenced samples were assayed for the presence of the trv virus using pcr with primers specific to the trv <dig> vector , and a virus coat protein  gene . lane 1 = negative control, lane 2 = red part of the silenced tomato fruit, lane 3 = yellow part of the silenced tomato fruit, and lane 4 = the positive control. rt-pcr analysis of the target genes in the silenced tomato fruits showed significantly different expression in the yellow areas of the fruits. asterisks indicate a significant difference as determined by student’s t-test 



subcellular localization of nf-y genes
from the vigs experiments it was concluded that five nf-y tf genes affected tomato fruit ripening. it is known that tfs regulate the transcription of target genes through binding to specific cis-elements in their promoters and that this binding takes place in the nucleus. to assess the subcellular localization of the five tfs, their full-length open reading frames  without the stop codon were cloned into a vector in frame with the green fluorescence protein  reporter gene under the control of the camv35s promoter. the resulting constructs and an empty  vector were transiently expressed in tobacco by <dig> protoplasts. fluorescence microscopy revealed that tfs with a nf-ya subunit, including solyc01g <dig>  solyc08g <dig> and solyc11g <dig> were localized in the nucleus , which is consistent with the subcellular localization of nf-ya proteins in mammals  <cit>  and a. thaliana  <cit> . one exception to this localization pattern was the wheat tanf-ya10- <dig>  which was found to be localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm  <cit> . tfs with a nf-yb subunit, including solyc07g <dig> and solyc06g <dig>  were localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm . it is known that nf-yb lacks a nuclear localization signal, and that only when it interacts with nf-yc, can the heterodimers be transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  <cit> . we infer from this result that heterodimers of tomato nf-yb proteins and endogenous tobacco nf-yc tfs likely formed during the transient expression analysis. taken together, the subcellular localization analysis of the nf-y tfs supports their proposed role as regulators of target genes.fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of nf-y proteins. tobacco by <dig> protoplasts were transiently transformed with 35s-gfp-nf-y or a gfp empty vector, and fluorescence was observed with a fluorescence microscope



discussion
based on the current tomato genome sequence and annotations from related databases, including sgn and planttfdb, a total of fifty-nine tomato nf-y genes were identified. in contrast with the well-studied functions of nf-y genes in regulating plant growth and development, as well as abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> , little is known about their role in fruit ripening. to address this deficiency, we used a combination of bioinformatic analysis and high-throughput vigs based gene functional screening to assess the potential involvement of fifty-nine predicted tomato nf-y genes in ripening. the bioinformatic analysis included a study of the phylogenetic relationships between a. thaliana and tomato nf-y proteins and an analysis of the chromosomal distribution, encoded protein motifs and exon/intron structure patterns of the tomato nf-y genes. this revealed similarities and conservation of nf-y gene function between a. thaliana and tomato. subsequent analysis of gene expression patterns, coupled with vigs-based silencing and subcellular localization studies of candidate genes, supported the involvement of a subset of nf-y tfs in regulating tomato fruit ripening.

bioinformatic analysis can be used to help predict the biological functions of gene prediction, and one approach is to use phylogenetic relationships among homologs from different species to infer function. as an example, there have been few functional studies of nf-y genes in fleshy fruit development but these genes have been studied in more detail in a. thaliana  <cit> , and so we performed a phylogenetic analysis of all the a. thaliana and tomato nf-y genes. we reasoned that members of the same clade might have similar specific expression patterns, such as that shown by atnf-yb <dig> , which is a critical regulator of embryo development, and is specifically expressed in developing embryos  <cit> . the tomato homologs, l1l <dig> to l1l <dig>  were reported to be expressed either in seeds, or in developing fruit, or both  <cit> . in some cases, similarities in terms of gene structures have also been attributed with biological significance  <cit> . we observed that genes in group nf-yb with only one exon  were in the same clade, while genes in another clade  had six exons. in addition, similar structures were noted for three nf-yc gene pairs: solyc03g111460/solyc03g <dig>  solyc00g107050/ solyc11g <dig>  and solyc11g072150/ solyc01g <dig>  nf-ya genes had fewer difference among members in gene structures .

using this analysis as a foundation, we next examined the expression patterns of the tomato nf-y genes during ripening to identify those that were specifically expressed, or showed predominant expression, in fruit. publicly available rna-seq data, was used to assess the expression of the tomato nf-y genes, which suggested thirteen candidate fruit ripening related regulators. real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis, of these thirteen nf-y genes revealed a range of expression pattern during fruit ripening and response to treatments with ethylene or 1-mcp. the expression of some of these genes such as solyc11g <dig> , solyc09g <dig> , solyc01g <dig> and solyc01g <dig> , was up-regulated during ripening and induced by ethylene , whose synthesis in system  <dig> is key to climacteric fruit including tomato  <cit> . expression of solyc06g <dig> was induced by the ethylene treatment , which was consistent with its up-regulated expression at the bk stage . other genes, including solyc11g <dig> , solyc06g <dig> and solyc06g <dig>  were induced by ethylene, but showed relatively minor changes in expressions during ripening, especially at the beginning of the bk stage. we deduced that these might not act as key regulators of ripening, especially when compared to solyc08g <dig> and solyc07g <dig>  whose silencing significantly influenced normal ripening . expression of some genes, such as solyc01g <dig> and solyc01g <dig>  was lower at the bk stage compared to mg but was induced by ethylene treatment , which suggests that ethylene might not be the only factor regulating their expression at onset of ripening. it was reported that nf-ya genes are the target of the microrna <dig>  <cit> , but it is not known whether mir <dig> regulates their expression at onset of tomato fruit ripening. interestingly, expression of solyc03g <dig> was not only induced by exogenous ethylene but also reduced by 1-mcp ; however, its down-regulated expression during ripening indicated a negative association with fruit ripening . in climacteric fruit, once ripening is initiated, the burst of system  <dig> ethylene is accompanied with the activation of many ripening related genes, such as acs <dig> and acs <dig>  in this study, expression of solyc03g <dig> was induced by exogenous but not endogenous ethylene, which may suggest that exogenous ethylene treatments induce stress in tomato fruits. this may be related to the observations that some nf-yc genes play a role in responses to abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> . it is also not known whether some nf-yc proteins whose functions overlap with that those of solyc03g <dig> competitively recruit nf-ya after forming a complex with nf-yb. plant nf-y genes are known to exhibit functional redundancy  and this might result in varying responses to ethylene when the fruits start to ripen.

the gene expression patterns suggested candidates for further analysis using vigs, a powerful tool for functional gene studies of tomato fruit development and ripening  <cit> , which has been used to assess the functions of genes encoding ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes in fruit ripening, such as slubc <dig> & slubc <dig>  <cit> . the vigs studies, together with confirmed subcellular localization of the candidate proteins in nucleus, indicated that nf-y tfs likely act to regulate tomato fruit ripening. for example, silencing the expression of either solyc01g <dig>  solyc06g <dig> or solyc07g <dig> resulted in altered fruit pigmentation in the earlier stages of ripening, although the fruits were uniformly red at later stages. for these fruits, the restoration of normal ripe coloration suggests that homologous genes may have compensated for the loss of function of the targeted nf-y genes. indeed, sequence similarity among the nf-y genes was apparent and the phylogenetic analysis indicated that solyc11g <dig> is closely related to solyc01g <dig>  with which it shares 70 % amino acid identity. additionally, solyc07g065500/solyc12g <dig>  and solyc03g114400/solyc06g <dig> share 68 % and 89 % aa identity, respectively . as a precedent, complementation of gene functions in the context of gene silencing has been reported for slubc <dig> and slubc <dig> in the ubiquitination process during tomato fruit ripening  <cit> . silencing of solyc07g <dig> led to accelerated color development in ripening fruit compared to the control, which suggests a role in suppressing ripening. indeed, the down-regulation of solyc07g <dig> expression during ripening , supports such role at the bk stage. a significant down-regulation tendency was consistent with its proper negative role at bk stage. a similar phenomenon been reported for slmads <dig>  the transcript abundance of slmads <dig> decreases significantly during ripening, and slmads1-silenced tomato fruits have a reduced ripening time, which suggested that slmads <dig> is a negative regulator of fruit ripening  <cit> .

taken together, the results of this study suggest that nf-y tfs play roles in the transcriptional regulation of tomato fruit ripening. the specific functions and modes of action of the different family members that were highlighted, and the interactions among the nf-y tfs with different subunits will be the subject of further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, fifty-nine tomato nf-y genes were identified, and the chromosomal distribution, gene structures, phylogenetic relationship and expression patterns were characterized. among the fifty-nine nf-y genes, the expressions of thirteen members showed evidence of being related to fruit ripening. furthermore, we examined their biological functions in ripening regulation using vigs and subcellular localization studies. we determined that five nf-y genes, including two members of the nf-yb subgroup  and three members of the nf-ya subgroup , influence ripening. in addition, subcellular localization analyses confirmed the localization of the encoded proteins, fused to the gfp reporter, in the nucleus. we conclude that  <dig> nf-y tfs play roles in tomato fruit ripening, and this will provide a platform for further investigation of their biological functions and the evolution of tomato nf-y gene family.
