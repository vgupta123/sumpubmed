BACKGROUND
the mosquito anopheles gambiae is the principal vector of human malaria in sub-saharan africa, particularly of the most deadly malaria species, plasmodium falciparum. mosquito susceptibility to p. falciparum has a strong genetic component, indicated by population-based mapping of quantitative trait loci  , and laboratory-based phenotypic selection of resistant lines  <cit> . however, the genome-wide association study  techniques that have been used to map human  <cit>  and plasmodium genes  <cit> , have not been successfully applied to the mosquito.

previous qtl mapping in wild a. gambiae pedigrees identified a cluster of loci that form the plasmodium resistance island   <cit> , a region containing a number of novel immune genes. the pri region was found to explain 89 % of the variation in resistance to p. falciparum. qtl mapping has high power to detect loci, but the extended linkage blocks reduce resolving power, and the 15 mb pri contains over  <dig> genes. association mapping in a complex population in principle can resolve loci to many fewer genes. population-based association testing of a small panel of candidate immune genes was applied to the mosquito in two studies  <cit> , which were limited because association requires large sample sizes, careful exclusion of population subdivision among the samples, and replication using independent phenotyped samples, which are all difficult in a. gambiae.

successful gwas is reliant on a combination of linkage, diversity, and allele penetrance. linkage disequilibrium  is a particularly important determinant of the power to detect a locus, while high levels of genetic diversity decrease the power of detection at a feasible sample size. optimum statistical power is achieved when ld is highest , the frequency difference between alleles is near  <dig>  and the variation in phenotype can be explained by a single allele of strong effect. however, a. gambiae offers conditions far from optimal, with negligible levels of ld , and nucleotide diversity at least an order of magnitude greater than that found in human  <cit> .

modified experimental approaches combining the strengths of linkage mapping with the resolution of association mapping have been used in some model systems. controlled-diversity colonies enable fine-resolution mapping under tractable genetic conditions in, for example, the mouse diversity outbred lines and the drosophila synthetic population resource . both of these approaches use material derived from advanced inter-crosses of inbred lines , with breeding controlled to prevent excessive genetic drift. the challenge in anopheles is similar, yet the context very different. in model organisms, the interest is to map a wide range of phenotypes within a series of highly controlled lines that still display sufficient phenotypic diversity. in comparison, vector biologists are more interested in particular phenotypes related to disease transmission such as pathogen interaction, behaviour and insecticide resistance, where it is desirable to capture natural variation. as well as clarifying the basic biology of mosquito-pathogen interactions and immunity, sampling natural alleles identifies natural factors that influence the epidemiology of malaria transmission. any method used for diversity-controlled gwas mapping should, therefore, provide a valid model for natural population structure of the species. that is, it should also represent a consistent panmictic subset of that population structure, as well as providing the same advantages as other controlled-diversity mapping approaches.

to this end, we developed a set of diversity-controlled a. gambiae founder colonies for use in genetic mapping and functional studies. the founder colonies are more favourable than wild mosquitoes for mapping because they display higher levels of informative ld, which facilitates detection of associations, they carry lower levels of genetic variation, which also augments the power of detection, and population subdivision is controlled to avoid the risk of spurious associations due to stratification. each founder colony was initiated with the eggs of ~ <dig> wild-caught females from west africa, which were genotyped for markers of population structure before combining into the defined founder colonies. using the founder colonies, we carried out a gwas study of anopheles susceptibility to infection with p. falciparum. the first stage used illumina sequence of infection phenotype pools as genotyping, in order to rapidly highlight candidate loci. in the second stage, mosquitoes were individually genotyped with a panel of informative snps filtered from the candidate loci, for technical validation, replication, and fine mapping of the association locus. finally, candidate genes were identified and functionally tested. an important advantage of the founder colony strategy as compared to gwas in wild populations is that functional follow-up studies can be done in the same genetic background before attempting to type candidate variants in the wild population.

RESULTS
initiation and genetic description of mapping populations from nature
we initiated founder colonies of a. gambiae m-form mosquitoes from the west african population  as a tool to reduce genetic complexity and enhance informativeness for mapping by pooled sequencing. the approach relies on unsupervised mating, each colony initiated with the progeny of ~ <dig> wild-captured gravid female mosquitoes. the founder mosquitoes assortatively mated in nature, thus ensuring that the progeny reproduce the genetic subdivisions of the natural population.

the genetic composition of founder colonies was determined by microsatellite typing. first, we compared genotypes for a highly polymorphic microsatellite, h <dig>  located at 42 mb on the left of the chromosome  <dig>  each of three founder colonies tested segregate six marker alleles, as compared to  <dig> alleles at this locus in the wild source population . overall, a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> wild alleles were detected among the three founder colonies. thus, any individual founder colony maintains and segregates limited variation, but the sum of multiple such colonies may approximate and serve as a proxy for the genetic diversity of the natural population. only one allele by state , the 109 nt allele , is shared by all three founder colonies, indicating that founder colonies capture largely distinct subsets of natural variation. interestingly, alleles that are rare in nature not only persist but can achieve appreciable frequency within a founder colony. thus, analysis of multiple founder colonies queries common and rare variants from the population.fig.  <dig> genetic diversity of west african founder colonies. a allele frequencies for microsatellite marker h <dig>  the wild population segregates  <dig> alleles, while each founder colony segregates a distinct subset of six alleles. only one wild allele is shared among all three founder colony. sample sizes  are indicated as numbers of alleles tested. b neighbor-joining trees based on pairwise fst values indicate that the colonies have captured distinct subsets of variation from the source wild population. all branches are significantly greater than 0



analysis of genetic variation and sharing between colonies using five microsatellite markers further indicates that the artificial population bottleneck creates the advantages of founder populations, which have been extensively discussed in human genetics  <cit> . the colonies are distinct but related synthetic populations, with varying levels of fst among colonies and the wild source population . thus, the founder colonies perform as a complexity-reduction tool for tractable genetic query of both frequent and rare natural allele frequency classes under controlled laboratory conditions and at reasonable sample sizes, but query a greater amount of variation than single-pair crosses.

we derived an estimate of the genetic mapping resolution of the founder colonies. the crossovers from a given point  are exponentially distributed with rate Νρ, where Ν is the number of crossovers and ρ is the crossover rate  <cit> , about one mb per cm in a. gambiae  <cit> . the expectation for the interval containing flanking crossovers around the trait locus is 1/Νρ from each side. therefore, when  <dig> individuals share the same variant under a dominant model, and ignoring the few homozygotes, the maximum resolution will be 2/Νρ = 2/nkρ, where n is the number of mosquitoes, k is the number of generations since the founding event. the current founder colonies were propagated for at least  <dig> generations since initiation, thus the expected resolution for a fully informative phenotype is at least 2/30*10*1 = 2/300 =  <dig> *10−2 =  <dig>  cm. this is a genomic average estimate of resolution, which will vary empirically according to the recombinational properties of different regions of the genome. in addition, loss of information due to incomplete penetrance of a trait would also extend the resolved mapping interval.

first-stage mapping by pooled sequencing identifies candidate loci
mosquitoes from two founder colonies, fd <dig> and fd <dig>  were challenged by feeding on cultured p. falciparum gametocytes, and individual mosquito infection phenotypes were determined by dissection and counts of midgut oocysts. dna from mosquitoes with similar phenotypes were combined and illumina-sequenced as pools. a quantitative description of the pools is given in the methods. sequences of pools were compared across the genome to detect regions displaying reduction in haplotype diversity, in order to detect candidate intervals carrying variants that underlie the phenotype. by definition, these decreased heterozygosity candidate intervals will be enriched for haplotypes carrying the causative haplotype, and other non-causative haplotypes will be simultaneously depleted from the same phenotype pool. regions of the genome not associated with the phenotype should display random segregation of haplotypes across pools.

the first mapping stage was comprised of genome-wide ascertainment of candidate loci. pooled heterozygosity  was calculated across sliding windows for each of the phenotype pools individually, as well as total heterozygosity for the whole founder colony combined. relative diversity  was calculated as the proportion of heterozygosity in a phenotype pool relative to total heterozygosity within the whole founder colony after normalising for overall read-depth in each pool. standard deviation of hpr values  was used to identify regions with over-represented haplotypes in a given phenotype pool by comparison to the same positions in the whole founder colony. the measurement of heterozygosity within a pool was done in comparison to the same positions in the whole founder colony, and thus was normalized for local variation of heterozygosity across the genome. the analysis yielded three candidate loci in two different founder colonies, located at chromosome:coordinates, 3 l:17409-19071 kb , 2r:17385-26524 kb , 2r:47490-60531 kb . these candidate loci were named  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. plots of candidate locus  <dig>  are shown in fig.  <dig>  and additional file 1: figure s <dig> . plots of candidate loci  <dig>  and  <dig>  are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> . candidate locus  <dig>  is coincident with the 2rb paracentric chromosomal inversion.fig.  <dig> genome-wide mapping of candidate genetic loci by measurement of relative heterozygosity in sequenced phenotype pools. plots depict heterozygosity measures on chromosome 3 l. a total pooled heterozygosity  was calculated in a sliding 10 kb window along chromosome 3 l within the fd <dig> founder colony. dots indicate minimum and maximum values for a 1 mb window, the black line indicates the average heterozygosity and the gray shading represents the standard deviation of total pooled heterozygosity across a 1 mb window. b relative diversity  per 1 mb window, calculated as the proportion of heterozygosity in a given pool relative to total heterozygosity within the source fd <dig> founder colony. color of point indicates per window elevated heterozygosity , or reduced heterozygosity , plotted as log base  <dig> of the relative diversity. phenotype pool identity is indicated in the lower left of each panel . a relative heterozygosity value of hpr =  <dig> indicates the same heterozygosity levels in tested pool as compared to all other pools, values of hpr >  <dig> indicate greater heterozygosity in the tested pool and values of hpr <  <dig> indicate lower heterozygosity in the tested pool. on the log scale y-axis, values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  are equidistant from  <dig>  candidate locus  <dig>  is indicated by the red vertical shaded bar at coordinates  <dig> - <dig>  mb. in this interval, relative heterozygosity is increased in the high pool and simultaneously reduced in the low and zero pools



in order to estimate significance values for mapped loci, a permutation analysis was carried out on the shpr values by reselecting allele frequencies randomly from each of the phenotype pools. after  <dig> tests, the selected shpr regions were found to have median shpr values that were within the  <dig> th percentile of those selected randomly .

functional description of candidate loci
coding sequences within candidate loci were analysed for enrichment of gene ontology  predicted functional categories. the two candidate loci from fd <dig> contain  <dig> genes for candidate locus  <dig>  and  <dig> genes for candidate locus  <dig> . while the large number of genes in the two fd <dig> loci might reduce the probability of detecting significant enrichments, both fd <dig> loci demonstrated enrichment for genes with potential immune functions, with highly significant enrichment  for monoxygenase function in candidate locus  <dig> , and the presence of multiple peroxidases in candidate locus  <dig> , consistent with either a detoxification or ros-based immune response. analysis of genes with significantly enriched go terms in candidate locus  <dig> , however, indicated that most of these genes belong to a single cytochrome p <dig> cluster between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb.

due to the coincidence of candidate locus  <dig>  with the 2rb chromosomal inversion, molecular karyotyping was carried out on all fd <dig> samples. there was only one 2rb/b homozygote in the high pool, with heterozygotes occurring randomly between all three pools . thus, there was low power to test, but also no evident support for association of the frequency of 2rb inversion genotypes or alleles with membership in phenotypic pools. for all mapped loci, we have tested for chromosomal inversions, and the shpr method controls internally for sequence read depth by comparing each pool to the whole founder colony. therefore, estimates of relative diversity should be robust to potentially confounding sources of local genome variation. the fd <dig> candidate locus  <dig>  contains only  <dig> genes, the majority of them with no functional information. genetically-based candidate gene ascertainment would require deeper pooled sequence data, or ideally sequence variation data from phenotyped individuals, resources that have not been generated. moreover, because the haplotype contains irrelevant as well as relevant snps in linkage, resolution by fine mapping may not be productive without propagation to generate additional recombinations. consequently, we performed ad hoc ascertainment of candidates based on recognizable predicted gene function and other evidence. of those with characterized function, two encode toll-family proteins, toll  <dig> and toll  <dig> .

second-stage fine mapping of candidate loci
the second mapping stage comprised candidate locus confirmation and prioritization of candidate genes. snps within the candidate loci displaying the greatest difference in minor allele frequencies between any two phenotype pools were selected for genotyping in individual mosquitoes. snps were selected based on sequence from individual founder colonies, and were tested only within the same founder colony. a total of  <dig> snps were chosen from fd <dig> across candidate loci  <dig>  and  <dig> , and  <dig> snps from fd <dig> for candidate locus  <dig> .

for each founder colony, fine-mapping was performed by genotyping all of the unpooled individual mosquitoes from the original infections from which the initial phenotype pools were constructed. for fd <dig>  an independent replicate infection, which did not contribute to the sequenced phenotype pools, was also genotyped. these two replicate infections were assessed by logistic regression separately, and where the odds ratio indicated the same effect, also together as one experiment . the individual typing of deconvoluted pools confirms that the pooled analysis results are recapitulated by individual genotyping, and serves as technical replication, while the typing of new material from the same colony but a completely independent infection serves as biological replication.

candidate locus  <dig>  contained two snps with significant association after permutation, influencing both oocyst infection prevalence and intensity . the interval of candidate locus  <dig>  was thus considered confirmed as a p. falciparum control locus, and following convention  <cit>  is named pfin <dig> . the variant at 3 l: <dig> is a c:a mutation in the intergenic region between toll  <dig>  and toll  <dig>  with an odds ratio of  <dig>  for oocyst infection intensity . the variant at 3 l: <dig> is a t:c mutation located immediately downstream of toll  <dig>  with an odds ratio of  <dig>  for oocyst infection prevalence . individual genotyping did not confirm association with infection phenotype for either of the chromosome 2r candidate loci,  <dig>  and  <dig> , and they were not analysed further. the size of the locus  <dig>  interval, ~2 mb, is broadly consistent with the above theoretical prediction of genetic resolution in the founder colonies.fig.  <dig> individual genotyping confirms nucleotide variation significantly associated with p. falciparum infection outcome. fine mapping by logistic regression analysis of fd <dig> colony snps within locus  <dig>  using individual mosquito snp genotypes. association is calculated across both biological replicates . red points indicate p values for association with the phenotype, oocyst intensity , blue points indicate p values for association with oocyst infection prevalence  pools). the dashed line indicates the significance threshold . genes within the locus are indicated beneath the plot; genes on the forward  and reverse  strands are shown separately, positions of toll  <dig> and toll  <dig> genes are indicated



toll  <dig> displays protective function against p. falciparum
bioinformatic filtering based on interpretable predicted gene functional and other evidence of the  <dig> predicted coding sequences within pfin <dig>  prioritized two genes encoding toll-family proteins, toll  <dig> and toll  <dig>  a functional test of toll  <dig> effect by rnai-mediated gene silencing followed by challenge with p. falciparum reveals that toll  <dig> mediates significant protection against oocyst infection . silencing of toll  <dig> caused an increase in oocyst prevalence of 16-38 % across three replicates . the consistent increase in infection prevalence across three replicates was highly significant . loss of toll  <dig> function incurred a mean risk ratio for oocyst infection of  <dig>  . there was no effect of toll  <dig> silencing upon a distinct phenotype, oocyst intensity .fig.  <dig> 
toll  <dig> activity protects mosquitoes against infection with p. falciparum. gene silencing of toll  <dig> followed by parasite challenge causes increased p. falciparum oocyst infection prevalence in a. gambiae. silencing of toll  <dig> does not significantly alter infection phenotypes. a prevalence of oocyst infection for fd <dig> colony individuals treated with control dsrna  or with dsrna directed against toll  <dig>  and challenged with p. falciparum in  <dig> replicate experiments . green bars, proportion of uninfected mosquitoes , red bars, proportion of mosquitoes with ≥  <dig> midgut oocyst. p-values are calculated using a χ
 <dig> test across treatments. b intensity of infection measured by the number of oocysts in midguts after dsrna treatment and infection challenge. intensity is only analyzed in mosquitoes with ≥ <dig> midgut oocyst. significance is calculated by the non-parametric wilcoxon rank-sum test. for both infection prevalence and intensity, p-values across replicates for intensity were combined by the method of fisher .  and  as in  and , but with dsrna directed against toll  <dig> . the number of replicates shown for oocyst intensity is less than for oocyst prevalence, because oocyst intensities were only statistically compared when the infection prevalences were above 30 % for both control and target gene silencing conditions. this cut-off provides for adequate statistical power for detecting differences in infection intensity



toll  <dig> did not show a significant effect for either infection prevalence or intensity . uninfected/infected risk ratios  did not indicate a phenotype for infection prevalence, . results for infection intensity were also negative . although not significant, the results displayed a tendency that could be suggestive of a weak phenotype in which reduction of toll  <dig> transcript levels may lead to a lower infection prevalence, opposite to the toll  <dig> phenotype. further work would be necessary to determine whether toll  <dig> may display a significant phenotype under other conditions or genetic backgrounds.

toll-family proteins are defined based on shared structural features  <cit> . despite structural relatedness with the toll receptor, toll  <dig>  the other toll-family members have not been well-characterized, and are not necessarily immune receptors. even in drosophila, functions of toll-family proteins or their signaling pathways, besides toll  <dig>  are also largely unknown  <cit> . in anopheles, toll  <dig> and the toll pathway are required for protection against rodent malarias, p. berghei and p. yoelii, while protection against the human malaria parasite p. falciparum is dominated by the imd pathway  <cit> . to our knowledge, the current results are the first report of a toll-family member displaying protective function against p. falciparum. this also represents one of the rare reports of immune function for toll-family proteins other than toll  <dig>  toll  <dig> remains a candidate gene for control of plasmodium susceptibility, and future work will be necessary to determine whether naturally occurring genetic variants in toll  <dig> are associated with differential susceptibility to p. falciparum.

discussion
we present a novel method of mosquito genomic mapping by pooled sequencing using recently initiated a. gambiae founder colonies, and demonstrate its applicability for mapping in a complex non-model genome. genome-wide mapping identified three candidate loci, and fine-mapping by individual genotyping confirmed one of these, named pfin <dig>  which was significantly associated with control of oocyst infection prevalence. functional testing of candidate genes encoding two toll-family proteins, toll  <dig> and toll  <dig>  revealed a significant influence of toll  <dig> upon p. falciparum oocyst infection prevalence.

mapping design
the founder colony mapping design allows us to sample natural variation with minimal breeding effort, and facilitates follow-up experiments under defined laboratory conditions. the limited diversity resulting from the founding event leads to simplified genetics, a limited number of founder alleles, and long haplotypes as compared to an association study based on field populations. distinct from the “laboratory colonies” commonly used in mosquito genetic studies, however, some of which are decades old, with unknown histories of contamination and admixture, here we initiate multiple defined independent recent colonies from a local population that segregate stable inventories of alleles and consistent ancestral haplotype blocks per colony. overall the design aims to balance advantages and limitations between two extremes in genetic mapping: i) gwas in field populations, and ii) linkage mapping with isogenic lines.

the presented mapping design has a number of significant advantages over previous approaches and provides a basis for future association studies in mosquitoes. as compared to association mapping at the level of individual mosquitoes, our method using founder colonies and pooled sequencing requires only moderate expenditure for both sequencing and genotyping, although the benefits are not limited just to cost savings. a. gambiae is a technically difficult subject for genomic association mapping. low levels of ld impair the power of locus detection, while high levels of diversity and the number of statistical tests necessary to query all diversity weaken the ability to detect a significant signal. the mosquito founder colony design used in this study alleviate both of these problems. the founder effect generated by initiating colonies from limited numbers of wild chromosomes increases informative ld, which augments power of locus detection, while simultaneously reducing the level of genetic diversity to a tractable level. at the time of colony initiation, the minor allele and minor haplotype frequencies were ~ <dig> , indicating that the founder bottleneck effectively created a mapping population with a large number of snps that perfectly type their haplotypes. the continued propagation of these strata-controlled colonies will aid subsequent follow-up studies, because functional assessment of candidate genes can be carried out in the same genetic background.

pooled sequencing is in a cost trade-off with individual sequencing, which would be maximally informative but is currently cost-prohibitive for routine use. the main weakness of pooled sequencing is that it is difficult to measure allele frequencies, which can decrease efficiency of ascertainment of informative snps for fine mapping. however, the practical consequence is not severe, because a reduced conversion rate from predicted assay to typable snp is overcome merely by testing more snps. an area of improvement in the future could be to analyze enrichment and depletion of particular alleles from extreme phenotype pools, which would not require exact measurements of allele frequencies within pools, but rather a comparison of allele frequencies across pools.

toll  <dig> as host-protective factor
genetic mapping identified a small locus containing two toll-family proteins, neither of which have a previously described phenotype. functional tests revealed a protective phenotype against p. falciparum oocyst infection prevalence for toll  <dig>  the toll family possess a single transmembrane domain, a leucine-rich repeat region of variable size, highly divergent extracellular n-terminal and a conserved c-terminal intracellular toll-ilk <dig> domain  <cit> . the toll  <dig> and toll  <dig> genes identified in this locus together represent a species-specific expansion in a. gambiae, without orthologs in drosophila.

the canonical toll-family member, toll  <dig>  has been extensively characterized in drosophila. in addition to a role in embryonic pattern formation, the toll pathway is activated in response to pathogens, including fungi and gram positive bacteria  <cit> . only a few other toll family members have described phenotypes, including anti-fungal and anti-viral functions for drosophila toll  <dig>  <cit>  and toll  <dig>  <cit> , respectively. studies in aedes aegypti also indicate an antiviral role for the toll pathway  <cit> . the precise mechanism of toll <dig> influence upon plasmodium infection will require detailed functional studies. as with any immune factor, toll <dig> may bind in a complex with other immune factors, cross-talk with other signaling pathways, change the midgut microbial flora and/or alter mosquito behavior, to name several possible considerations. in any case, the decrease in toll <dig> transcript by gene silencing influences development of p. falciparum in the mosquito.

two of the  <dig> anopheles toll family genes are thought to play immune roles, with toll  <dig> and toll  <dig> activity against gram positive bacteria  <cit> , and an antifungal role for toll  <dig>  <cit> . toll  <dig> and toll  <dig> display differential transcriptional regulation during embryonic development  <cit>  and both genes are upregulated in response to bloodfeeding  <cit> . toll  <dig>  has further been shown to be differentially regulated in response to infection with p. berghei and falciparum  <cit> . the expression profile suggested a potential anti-plasmodium role for this locus, but two previous attempts to associate variants in toll  <dig> and toll  <dig> with oocyst number generated negative results  <cit> . the success of any association study depends on the selection of snp markers with sufficient genetic informativeness, as discussed above. in the absence of comprehensive haplotype maps from which informative tagging snps could be derived, the greatest success will be achieved by a method that employs artificial haplotype creation or control and that genotypes with snps from the same population, as we have done here.

follow-up studies of the pfin <dig> locus in the natural population would be necessary to query the phenotypic penetrance of the locus, including sensitivity to epistasis with host genetic background and parasite genetic variation. another reason to study the population is to determine the natural allele frequency of the locus. for that purpose, a high-density marker map of the pfin <dig> locus could be used to type wild collections, in order to identify a core haplotype and measure its frequency.

CONCLUSIONS
anopheles genetic association and mapping studies in nature remain a challenge. wild samples must be carefully typed for population structure and likely other confounding factors such as polymorphic inversions, which means that a large excess of samples need to be collected in order to assemble sufficient numbers of the targeted panmictic group. another challenge is phenotyping of the wild samples. for malaria infection, wild-infected samples could be used, but this introduces variables such as mosquito age, host preference, and survival that, at best, demand larger sample size to overcome the noise, and at worst could introduce spurious results. alternatively, wild samples can be phenotyped by experimental infection with blood from gametocyte carriers as we have done previously  <cit> , but this is technically demanding, and constitutes research with human subjects. consequently, we explored the potential of colony-based representation of wild populations. we propose that controlled-diversity mapping populations, such as the founder colony design used here, are the preferred means for the foreseeable future for first-pass mapping of novel genomic regions of importance for plasmodium resistance and other phenotypes in anopheles, with possible follow-up in the natural population as appropriate.
