BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short, single-stranded, noncoding rnas that regulate gene expression by interacting with or inhibiting mrna in both plants and animals  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> human mirnas have been identified and the total number is still increasing  <cit> . it is estimated that about two thirds of all protein-coding genes are regulated by mirnas  <cit> . although some mirnas are yet to be characterized, biochemical and genetic studies have indicated that mirna regulation is essential for biological processes such as development, differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that mirna genes can be aberrantly expressed in human cancers and they function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes via regulation of target transcripts  <cit> .

although formalin fixed, paraffin embedded  tissue samples typically contain fragmented nucleic acids, they are the most commonly available clinical specimens for histology and pathological analysis and are a critical resource for developing new molecular markers in the cancer research  <cit> . because of their small size, mirna molecules appear to be less prone to degradation, in contrast to mrna expression studies, and no significant differences in mirna expression between ffpe and ff samples have been observed  <cit> .

real-time quantitative pcr  is considered a 'gold standard' for quantification of gene expression and has been widely employed as a validation method for microarray studies. however, the qpcr method is a relatively low throughput, high cost, and tedious technique typically performed in a  <dig> or  <dig> well plate format. the fluidigm microfluidic technology uses the integrated fluidic circuits  which contain tens of thousands of microfluidic controlled valves and interconnected channels to move molecules of biological samples and reagents in a variety of patterns  <cit> . ifcs reduce a qpcr reaction from the routine 10- <dig> microliter volume down to a  <dig> nanoliter scale making it possible to perform routine qpcr analysis for thousands of reactions in a single run. this technology has been used for gene expression, genotyping, mutation detection, and absolute quantization of nucleic-acid sequences  <cit> . spurgeon et al.  <cit>  showed that microfluidic dynamic arrays can be used to simultaneously measure  <dig> mrnas in several tissues. wang et al.  <cit>  developed a high throughput snp genotyping assay demonstrating high accuracy and call rate in human samples using a nanofluidic platform. this new real-time pcr technology makes it possible to perform validation as well as high throughput gene expression measurements using very limited sample and reagent quantities  <cit> .

here we show that mirna expression profiling and validation are possible using high throughput real-time quantitative pcr  method with the microfluidic technology. ffpe and ff samples appear to perform similarly in this platform when cdna are generated from  <dig> multiplexed rt reactions. we compared this new approach to the standard microarray-based technology. to our knowledge, this study is the first report comparing mirna expression profiling between microarrays and qpcr using microfluidic arrays.

RESULTS
correlation of reverse transcription efficiency between single- and multiplexed primer sets
to evaluate the efficiency of reverse transcription  reactions using different number of primer, we first compared the use of a single mirna specific primer and an  <dig> primer-mixed set using  <dig> ng total rna isolated from a <dig>  and h <dig> lung cancer cells . after the rt reaction, a pre-amplification pcr was performed for  <dig> cycles and qrt-pcr was carried out using individual taqman probes for all  <dig> genes. results in figure  <dig> showed a strong correlation of ct values between the two conditions with correlation coefficients at  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for a <dig> and h <dig> cell lines.

reproducibility of expression levels between  <dig>  dynamic arrays and abi  <dig> ht
as an initial evaluation to determine mirna expression by using  <dig>  dynamic array, we tested its reproducibility by comparing ct values observed between abi  <dig> ht and fluidigm dynamic array system using ff samples. fourteen out of  <dig> mirna targets exhibited lower ct values in the microfluidics  <dig>  dynamic array system compared to those obtained by standard qpcr using the abi  <dig> ht . the mean ct values between the platforms were  <dig>   for the  <dig>  dynamic array and  <dig>   for the abi  <dig> ht  reflecting a significantly increased sensitivity by the microfluidics array when qpcr reactions are being carried out in nanoliter volumes.

comparison of mirna expression between ff and ffpe samples
we next used both abi  <dig> ht and fluidigm  <dig>  dynamic array to directly compare the qrt-pcr performance using rna from ff and ffpe samples over a wide range of mirna gene expression levels. the cdna was synthesized using a 96-plex primer set and  <dig> ng of total rna from both sample types. the ct values of ffpe samples ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> while those of ff samples ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> on the standard abi platform with correlations at r =  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, p <  <dig> ) . when the same reaction were carried out using the  <dig>  dynamic arrays, ffpe samples had similarly higher average ct values compared to ff samples reflecting the generally lower quality of the rna in ffpe samples . again, the ct values from both sample types were highly correlated .

effect of rna template concentration using  <dig>  dynamic arrays
to evaluate the dynamic range of the multiplex rt-pcr in the  <dig>  dynamic array systems, we evaluated the ct values for each mirna target using total input rna quantities at  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng,  <dig> ng or  <dig> ng per reaction. the reverse transcription and pre-amplification were carried out in 96-plex format and the qpcr were run using  <dig>  dynamic arrays. the scatter plots shown in figure  <dig> demonstrates that the correlation coefficients were essentially the same over the tested range of input rna for both ff  and ffpe samples  with the lowest correlation at r =  <dig>  .

comparison of mirna expression between the  <dig>  dynamic array and affymetrix genechip microrna microarray
we compared mirna expression levels measured by the  <dig>  dynamic array with those obtained from the affymetrix mirna genechip™. the same samples, ff <dig> and ffpe <dig> analyzed by the  <dig>  dynamic array were subjected to gene expression profiling using the affymetrix mirna arrays. in the affymetrix mirna array analysis, 33-35% of mirna targets were detectable in each sample with a correlation of r =  <dig> . similarly, strong correlations were also obtained using the  <dig>  dynamic array when replicate rna samples were analyzed . this high correlation value was consistent across both ff and ffpe sample types . overall, the mirna microarray profiles generated for ffpe and ff samples showed high correlations across all  <dig> human mirnas . similarly, the ct values above detection threshold were obtained for  <dig>  and  <dig>  of  <dig> mirna targets by the qpcr-based analysis using microfluidics. fifty-nine probes that were called present on affymetrix mirna array matched those tested by the  <dig>  dynamic array. comparison of the fold changes between the two samples obtained by fluidigm and affymetrix arrays showed an overall correlation of r =  <dig> . significantly, the fold changes detected by affymetrix microarray ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> , while those by fluidigm ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> reflecting a much higher dynamic range by the microfluidics platform .

discussion
micrornas are potential biomarkers and novel targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and recurrence  <cit> . conventional methods for detection and characterization of mirnas during clinical investigations sometimes fall short because of low throughput, insufficient sensitivity, and relatively high cost. the recently developed microfluidic technology enables a significantly higher throughput qpcr analysis for a large number of samples; and assays in a much shorter time and at a lower cost compared to the conventional methods  <cit> . this new real-time pcr technology can be used to perform experimental validation as well as high throughput gene expression measurement with nearly 100-fold less input of sample and reagent  <cit> . in this study, we examined mirna expression measurements using qpcr-based microfluidic technology using ffpe and matched ff samples. we evaluated this relatively high throughput mirna profiling method using the standard taqman mirna assays on abi  <dig> ht and the fluidigm microfluidic dynamic arrays. we also developed and validated mirna expression assays using cdna made from either singleplex or multiplex rt reactions and assessed their application for high-throughput mirna profiling using the microfluidic dynamic arrays.

taqman® assays are traditionally used for validation of microarray-based expression analysis  <cit> . the rt primer in each taqman® mirna assay is a single-stranded stem-loop rt primer which was developed to allow cdna detection to be more specific and sensitive as compared to conventional linear primer reverse transcription  <cit> . based on this result, chen, et al. suggested that stem-loop rt primers can be used for multiplex rt reaction and small rna cloning for better efficiency and specificity  <cit> . in our study, the absolute ct for mirna expression levels by singleplex were slightly lower than those obtained in multiplex conditions, but both methods showed high correlation compared to results of the qrt-pcr  .

several studies have demonstrated that ffpe samples can be used for mirna profiling analysis  <cit> . however, most of the studies are based on microarray data and validated using low throughput applied biosystems qpcr platforms  <cit> . here, we compared the correlation of mirna expression profiles between ffpe and matched ff samples using both qpcr and array bases platforms. we observed a high correlation of mirna expression levels  measured for both sample types using the abi  <dig> ht and the  <dig>  dynamic array . ff samples appeared to contain higher levels of mirnas than ffpe samples in our study, consistent with results observed by leite, et al  <cit>  using standard qpcr assays. this could be due to the loss of mirna during paraffin embedding process or rna extraction. considering the minimal influence on mirna measurements, the small difference of ct values between ffpe and ff samples is not expected to affect the result of the study, particularly for fluidigm based studies since the reference mirna targets are measured on the same array for the exact same sample.

to compare between qpcr platforms, we investigated  <dig> different mirna targets using both abi  <dig> ht and microfluidic technology with ff rna samples. the ct value of the  <dig>  dynamic array system shifted toward lower ct values compared to those observed by abi  <dig> ht in a  <dig> μl reaction. in our hands, the mean ct value difference was  <dig>  between the two systems and the coefficient of variation across the  <dig> reactions in the  <dig>  dynamic array system was  <dig> % . in addition, we showed that as little as  <dig> ng of total rna could be used to detect all  <dig> mirnas with 96-multiplexing rt reaction in both ffpe and ff samples . the minimal correlation coefficient observed was  <dig>  for  <dig> ng vs. <dig> ng input rna for both ff and ffpe samples . lao et al.  <cit>  suggested that  <dig> ng of a human lung sample can be assessed with a substantial degree of accuracy without statistical variations from stochastic effects when multiplex rt reactions are employed. therefore, our data are consistent with those previously reported and indicates that 96-multiplexed mirna rt reactions can provide reliable mirna profiles when using low input amounts in the dynamic array systems. although just a few samples were used in this study, the robustness of the assay was demonstrated consistently for all tested assays varying at a wide range of ct values .

to determine the concordance between qpcr-arrays and microarrays, we compared mirna expression using  <dig>  dynamic arrays and the hybridization-based mirna array offered by affymetrix. we used the same samples for both analyses and the overall correlation for the  <dig> shared genes was r =  <dig>   for mirna expression between the two platforms. this moderate correlation likely reflects the use of fundamentally different principles for gene expression measurements in these two platforms. fluidigm uses the quantitative pcr assays which are highly sensitive with a dynamic range of at least 6- <dig> logs  <cit> . in contrast, affymetrix genechip is primarily based on hybridization of the labeled probes to the matching oligonucleotides that are affixed to a matrix. the dynamic range of the microarray is usually  <dig> to  <dig> logs  <cit> . in our hands, the maximum fold change observed was around  <dig> for affymetrix arrays and  <dig> for fluidigm dynamic array .

several studies have previously reported a similar rate of inter-platform concordance among different mirna microarrays and the different expression values from each mirna microarray platform when compared to qpcr values  <cit> . although highly sensitive, the quality of the gene expression assessment by the taqman-based method is dependent largely on the specificity of the probe to discriminate among highly conserved mirna target sequences as well as the sensitivity of the assay probes to quantitatively measure the target mirna over a wide range of expression levels. the small 18- <dig> nucleotide length of the mirna targets creates a challenge to meet these requirements. pradervand, et al.  <cit>  observed that the different gc content of mature mirna sequences contributes to higher difference values between both affymetrix and qpcr. this same study also showed a lower correlation between qpcr and affymetrix while reporting a higher correlation between qpcr based assay and other platforms . in the study by chen, et al.  <cit> , a correlation of  <dig>   was reported between taqman qpcr-array and microarray. the variation observed was thought to result from the low abundance mirnas reflecting the different sensitivities of the two platforms. therefore, the assessment of mirna expression in a given system should be interpreted with caution and it requires validation using at least two different platforms when the correlation is poor or the expression level of the target is low.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that multiplexing rt reactions with stem-loop primers can be adapted with relative ease to a new qpcr-array based microfluidic platform to profile mirna expression profiling. we showed that this approach is highly reproducible and correlates closely with standard abi <dig> systems yet offers higher throughput, with much lower sample input, and reagent usage. we believe that the microfluidic dynamic array technology could be used to develop cost effective and customized assays with rapid turn-around for profiling and validating of mirna expression.
