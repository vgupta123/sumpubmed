BACKGROUND
adventitious root  formation with high economic significance in horticulture, agriculture and forestry is a complex physiological process. the ornamental plant propagation relies on globalised chains for young plant production via rooting of cuttings ensuring an effective utilization of beneficial external and internal factors. the whole process includes three phases, axillary bud and shoot growth on donor plants , subsequent logistics  of cuttings and insertion of the cuttings into rooting media. during this process strong transcriptomic and metabolic changes occur with high importance of nitrogen availability, dark exposure and various irradiance levels. thus, reciprocal regulations force adaptations in nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism during phases of axillary bud and shoot growth, dark induced senescence of cuttings, stress recovery under diurnal light and ar formation in cuttings. it has already been shown that the level of nitrogen assimilation by donor plants changes nitrogen fluxes and rebalances the pools of carbohydrates and amino acids  <cit> . moreover, degradation and re-synthesis of proteins enable survival of rootless cuttings and are required for the regeneration of the missing root organs. since ar formation relies on selective proteolysis and re-synthesis of proteins, the total nitrogen stock in the cuttings constitutes a key limiting factor  <cit> . interestingly, there are similarities and differences between ar formation and lateral roots  <cit>  especially for nitrogen deficiency and ethylene signalling and synthesis in planta. n deficiency stimulates lateral roots of sessile plants having already their intact root system. then lateral root formation starts with highly cell-specific responses to external nitrogen signals that are directed towards nutrient-rich soil patches to ensure nutrient acquisition  <cit> . in contrast, excised axillary shoot tips  such as petunia cuttings experience wounding and isolation and thus solely rely on shoot-born signals with specific transcriptome and metabolome responses . when the vascular continuum collapses, auxin accumulates and induces ar formation in stem base tissue  <cit> . primary auxin control of ar formation depends on secondary signals like nitric oxide, polyamines and ethylene  <cit> . recently, an aminotransferase protein was reported to coordinate the biosynthesis of the hormones ethylene and auxin  <cit> . further, auxin triggers the activation of a plant target of rapamicin complex that is expressed in primary meristems and integrates auxin and nutrient signalling by regulated protein translations  <cit> . thus, nitrogen resources are pivotal for protein synthesis in the stem base of cuttings, wherein the predominant amino acids comprise glutamine , glutamate , asparagine  and aspartate   <cit> . carbohydrate reserves and nitric oxide  enhance resilience of plant tissues and survival of dark senescence . as ar formation depends on protein re-synthesis  <cit>  from mobile or recycled nitrogen reserves such as asn  <cit>  these could be limiting in case of n deficiency and result in an accelerated leaf senescence  <cit>  differing from lateral roots formation, in this respect  <cit> . so far nitrogen and carbohydrate limitations of ar formation have been shown in pelargonium, chrysanthemum, poinsettia and rosa . enhanced ar formation at high nitrogen contents may be related to an increased basipetal transport of carbohydrates  <cit>  and nitrogenous compounds  <cit>  with limited knowledge of the causal mechanisms including transcriptome, hormone and metabolic adaptations. using petunia hybrida as a model plant three metabolic phases for ar formation were established  <cit>  during which nitrogen supply was maintained at adequate levels. a dynamic depletion and replenishment of carbohydrates has been reported in course of dark exposure of the cuttings and their subsequent rooting under light with stimulating effect on root formation  <cit> . in addition, at adequate nitrogen levels a strong contribution of the polar auxin transport  to ar formation was shown by an early increase of indole-3-acetic acid  in petunia  <cit> . moreover, multiple transcriptome changes in auxin transport systems, auxin conjugation and auxin signal perception uncovered auxin as a key regulator of ar formation during sink establishment phase  <cit> . at the sink side amino acids and nitrogen pools provide important n resources to meet the new demand for protein re-synthesis. in addition, variation in n resources may have an influence on auxin levels. it is supposed that prior to excision of cuttings various signalling hormones including cytokinin  communicate the nitrogen availability from donor plant roots to axillary shoots  <cit>  and that their activity can be related partially to glutamine metabolism  <cit> . ck’s are considered as auxin antagonists and important negative regulators of ar formation  <cit>  that would counteract auxin distribution via down-regulation of pin activity  <cit> . in contrast, ck’s are also considered as important signals for dedifferentiation processes during early induction of ars  <cit>  and are required for fine tuning of the auxin transport and biosynthesis during the formation of the quiescent centre in the adventitious root apex  <cit> . in this regard, shoot levels of both ck’s and gibberellins decline with an interrupted nitrogen supply to roots  <cit> . this complexity of functions of nitrogen metabolism interacting with plant hormone signalling might explain the lack of information on the influence of nitrogen nutrition of donor plants and dark exposure of cuttings on their nitrogen metabolism and ar formation. therefore, the present study tested the hypothesis that enhanced nt contents and dark exposure of cuttings influence their internal n-pools including free amino acids and affect early events of ar formation and further root development in petunia hybrida.


RESULTS
anatomy of early events during ar formation at different nitrogen contents
the histological examinations revealed that first meristematic cells of developing root meristems, i.e. small cells with a dense cytoplasm and a large nucleus were visible at  <dig> hpin in stem base sections of cuttings with two different total nitrogen  contents  . at this time the difference between the nitrogen contents was marginal but at  <dig> hpin there was a significant difference between the two nt levels. whereas in the cuttings with the low nt level only meristems were formed as the most advanced structures , the treatment with the high nt level led to root formation with first cells characteristic for the elongation zone .fig.  <dig> influence of reduced total nitrogen on early cytological events of ar formation in petunia hybrida. cuttings with two nitrogen levels,  n-low at 2570 μmol nt and  n-high at 3625 μmol nt were excised from donor plants and immediately inserted into perlite for ar formation with assimilatory light. all micrographs represent cross-sections of the stem base from 1–4 mm above the excision site with the most advanced structures at  72 h post excision  and post insertion  and   <dig> hpe and hpin. sections at  <dig> hpin  show the typical stem anatomy with the cortex , the outer phloem , the cambium , the xylem , the inner phloem  and the pith parenchyma  and first meristematic cells  of developing root meristems, that is, small cells with a dense cytoplasm and a large nucleus. there are only slight differences between the nitrogen levels. sections at  <dig> hpin reveal that with low n absorption  first root meristems  appear, whereas with high n absorption  first roots with vascular bundles  in the center surrounded by elongated cells  of the elongation zone are visible. bars represent 100 μm . remark: ahkami et al.  <cit>  show that at the time of excision  no meristematic cells of developing root meristems are present. further details are presented in methods and with additional file 1) experiments of nitrogen preconditioning of cuttings and additional file 2) explanation of experimental designs for exp. 7: ar-n + cyt, respectively




nitrogen pools in response to total n-absorption by cuttings
to characterise ranges of nt contents and fractionated pools of nitrogen  within excised cuttings, their growth  with distinct n dosage  regimes to donor plants was monitored  . the nt content of whole cuttings was determined on a dry mass  basis . the nd-low, nd-high and nd-excess regimes produced nt contents of cuttings of 3112 ±  <dig>  4034 ±  <dig>  5004 ± 119 μmol nt g− <dig> dm, respectively. considering all  <dig> samples, nt changed between  <dig> and 5300 μmol g− <dig> dm . allocation of nt to four nf-pools such as amide-n, amino-n, nitrate-n and insoluble protein-n was positively correlated with nt, as shown by linear regressions fitted between nt and each nf-pool except amide-n. the amide-n remained very low both for nd-low  and nd-high  fertilization levels but rose steeply about 12-fold with excessive n-supply . nitrate-n ranging from  <dig> to 960 μmol g− <dig> dm was the most continuously increasing nf-pool  followed by protein-n as most abundant nf-pool while amino-n was most stable in the lowest range .fig.  <dig>  relationships between accumulation of total nitrogen  and n allocation to nf-pools. axillary shoot tips of petunia hybrida at excision time, nt allocation to metabolic nf-pools classifying amide-n, amino-n, insoluble protein-n and the sum of nf-pools in response on three levels of nd fertilization to donor plants . linear correlation coefficients for nitrate-n , amide-n , amino-n , insoluble protein-n  and sum of nf-pools  all n =  <dig>  p <  <dig> .  increase in shoot dry mass per cutting during ar formation  in response to two levels of nd fertilization to donor plants  and to a pre-rooting dark exposure of cuttings . vertical bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of mean values and different lower-case letters indicate significant differences. further details of experiments, regression equations and statistics are presented in methods and with additional file 1) experiments of nitrogen preconditioning of cuttings, additional file 2) explanation of experimental designs for statistical analyses and additional file 3) supplemental data of figure  <dig> for panel a: exp. 1: nf-n, and panel b: exp. 9: nf-ndcr, respectively




shoot growth during ar formation
shoot dry mass accumulation of excised cuttings was analysed during ar formation under diurnal light at three time points of insertion in perlite  . in advance, cuttings of low and high nt contents  were excised from donor plants grown with two fertigation rates . further, cuttings were exposed to dark . both, cuttings without and with dark exposure did not differ in their initial dry mass at  <dig> hpin whereas a high nt content enhanced dry mass by +10 % as a significant main n-effect. dry mass accelerated mostly with increasing time of insertion up to  <dig> hpin by +79 %. upon dark exposure this increase was reduced to +50 % while the delay for low n cuttings was most obvious at  <dig> hpin.

ar formation with reduced n absorption and dark exposition of cuttings
the effect of distinct n dosage to donor plants  on nt contents in cuttings  and ar formation was analysed. total root number  developed per cutting at day  <dig>  differed significantly and reached  <dig>  and  <dig>  for low and high nt contents, respectively . for detailed analyses, all roots of a cutting  were assigned to seven root length classes to determine the root number per length class . an increased root development for high nt contents became evident in the length classes below 3 cm , and a significant reduction was observed with low nt contents . subsequently, the effect of a pre-rooting dark exposure of cuttings on ar formation was evaluated with cuttings grown at high nd supply to donor plants to prevent n-limitation in cuttings . excised cuttings were exposed to dark for 7 days  before perlite insertion. sixteen days after excision  cuttings developed a trn of  <dig>  roots per cutting. at the same time  they developed considerably less roots  when no dark was applied and perlite insertion was performed immediately after excision. the rnc analysis showed a prerequisite for pre-rooting dark treatment to increase root numbers in the second and third classes. however, cuttings without dark exposure developed in average two roots more in the first class <1 cm . these results substantiated by a larger experiment showed that an enhanced ar formation  <dig> hpe led to an increase of trn by 73 %  and of trl by 110 %  with low and high n supply , respectively . in contrast, in the same experiment a treatment combination of both the donor plant n dosages and dark exposure resulted in an increase of trn by +30 % and of trl by +40 % in cuttings with a low nt while cuttings with a high nt had slightly fewer  and shorter roots  . nt contents ranged from  <dig> to 3900 μmol nt g− <dig> dm with nd-low and nd-high dosages  and no dark exposure, respectively . regression analysis resulted in positive relationships for nt with trl, trn and single root length   and negative with percentage of unrooted cuttings at  <dig> hpe .fig.  <dig> adventitious root formation  <dig> hpe with cuttings of petunia hybrida:  root number per length class  with two levels of total nitrogen content  .  rnc response to dark exposure .  response of total root number  and total root length  on combinations of two nt levels and dark exposure .  regression relationships between nt contents in unrooted cuttings and their final root development at different nd fertilization levels to donor plants   vertical bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of mean values and different lower-case letters indicate significant differences.  linear correlation coefficients: panel e , panel f , panel g  and panel h  all with n =  <dig>  p <  <dig> . further details of experiments, rating of rooting , statistics and regression equations are presented in methods and with additional file 1) experiments of nitrogen preconditioning of cuttings, additional file 2) explanation of experimental designs for statistical analyses and additional file 3) supplemental data of figure  <dig> for panel a: exp. 7: ar-n + cyt; panel b

nitrogen content and n allocation in unrooted cuttings and during ar formation
the low and high nitrogen fertilisation regime  of donor plants resulted in two different nt absorption levels in cuttings while dark exposure of cuttings  remained without any impact on nt contents . in contrast, after cuttings had been planted  into perlite and exposed to diurnal light a longer time post insertion resulted in continuous decreases of nt contents in both immediately planted and dark pre-exposed cuttings . allocations of nt to single nf-pools were affected quite differently by external factors . amino-nf accumulated 12–25 % of nt, with both elevated nd levels and dark exposure increasing amino-n in excised cuttings  and in dark-exposed cuttings  . amino-n decreased continuously with longer time post insertion . while 5–18 % of nt were allocated to nitrate-n at the two nd levels, the dark exposure of cuttings did not change nitrate-n content . in contrast, nd level and increasing time post insertion resulted in distinct reduction of nitrate-n . insoluble protein-nf was most abundant and comprised 50–70 % of nt . an increased n supply enhanced protein-nf followed by a decrease upon dark exposure at both nd supply levels . dark treatment accelerated subsequent reduction of protein-nf with longer time post insertion and exposure to diurnal light. with both nd levels, largest divergence occurred among cuttings with and without dark treatment  <dig> hpin. finally, protein-nf similarly decreased  <dig> hpin to lowest amounts irrespective of dark treatment . amide-n as smallest nf-pool accumulated merely 0– <dig>  % of nt . the nd level and dark exposure raised the amide-nf up to 42 μmol in excised cuttings  and up to 140 μmol in dark-exposed cuttings . dark exposure released much more amide-n within high nt cuttings compared to low nt cuttings . regardless of a differential accumulation of amide-n in excised cuttings or after dark exposure, amide-n declined largely with increasing time post insertion  with both low and high nd supply. thereby different reduction rates proved dark exposure and time post insertion as variation sources .fig.  <dig> change of total nitrogen  and nf-pools in cuttings of petunia hybrida with graduated nitrogen fertilisation  to donor plants, dark exposure and ar formation. : full cycles and open squared symbols connected with full and intermittent lines show cuttings directly at severance  and after 168 h dark exposure , respectively. : full cycles and open squared symbols connected with full and intermittent lines represent cuttings at specific times post insertion for ar formation  at  <dig> hpe and after 168 h dark exposure , respectively. all data are given in μmol n g− <dig> dm. multifactorial anova’s revealed significant main and interaction effects for nd-levels p <  <dig>  , for dark exposure p <  <dig>  , for time post insertion p <  <dig>  , for nd-levels × dark exposure p <  <dig>  , for nd-levels × time post insertion p =  <dig>  , for dark exposure × time post insertion p <  <dig>  . vertical bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of mean values. further details of experiments and statistics are presented in methods and with additional file 1) experiments of nitrogen preconditioning of cuttings, additional file 2) explanation of experimental designs for statistical analyses and additional file 3) supplemental data of figure  <dig> for exp. 6: nf-nd  and for exp. 9: nf-ndcr , respectively




change of free amino acids upon raising nitrogen nutrition and dark exposure
free amino acids were examined in source and sink tissues  applying three nd levels to donor plants and dark exposure of cuttings . amino acids represent a pivotal part of the amino-nf and include shared amounts of total nitrogen in plant tissues ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % of nt. the levels of total and single amino acids glu, gln, asp, asn and arg responded both to graduated nd fertilization of donor plants and dark exposure of cuttings . further, specific patterns for amino acids were observed in the leaf and stem base of excised cuttings at  <dig> hpe and after dark exposure at  <dig> hpe, respectively . hence, free amino acid  considerably changed between  <dig> and 26 μmol g− <dig> fm and accumulated between  <dig> and 4260 nmol n g− <dig> fm = aa-nt. aa raised in excised cuttings  with enhanced nd levels from  <dig> to 8 μmol g− <dig> fm in the leaf  and from  <dig> to 10 μmol g− <dig> fm in stem base . dark exposure of cuttings during 168 h led to a general increase, up to 4-fold of aa released in leaf and stem base while a maximum of 26 μmol g− <dig> fm was observed in leaf at the highest nd level . as primary metabolite in n assimilation, glutamate concentration was at higher levels in leaf compared to stem tissue and increased with the increasing nd supply up to 2622 nmol glu g− <dig> fm. further, elevated nd levels raised glutamate in leaf of both excised  and dark exposed cuttings . while n supply increased from high nd to excess nd, the glu reduction in stem base showed an interacting effect among nd-level and tissue type. besides this, dark exposure decreased glu in leaf partly at distinct nd levels  . altogether, glutamate accumulated between  <dig> and 250 nmol nt in response to different nitrogen levels and dark exposure. in excised cuttings  aspartate also increased with increasing nd supply. in contrast to glu, in leaf and stem tissue an increase was observed for asp in response to dark exposure. highest asp-increase induced by dark was monitored with low n cuttings . driven by three variation sources, asp accumulated between  <dig> and 276 nmol nt. arginine  in stem and leaf tissues of excised cuttings  accumulated at very low levels , although elevated nd levels increased arg slightly in the leaf and decreased it marginally in the stem. however, a dark exposure of cuttings  resulted in tremendous, almost 9-fold increase of up to 1734 nmol arg especially in leaf tissues grown at high nd supply  while n amounts allocated to the arg pool changed between  <dig> and 461 nmol nt. glutamine  in cuttings  reflected the nd levels to donor plants in a tissue specific manner. at elevated nd level it increased in the stem about 17-fold up to 4341 nmol gln g− <dig> fm. the dark exposure  reduced gln in leaf tissue particularly at raised nd levels, but caused contrasting responses in stem base tissue among low and raised nd levels . the nd level remained the critical source of variation for gln in stem base while dark exposure was the important factor in the leaf. coherent nt allocations to the glutamine pool ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to 832 nmol nt in leaf and stem tissue, correspondingly. biosynthesis of asparagine involves aspartate and glutamine as the ammonium acceptor and donor, respectively. asparagine  increased in excised cuttings  with nd levels in a tissue specific response. it remained very low in the leaf  and accumulated in significant amounts only in stem base at high nd levels . in contrast, a dark exposure  caused strong specific increases in leaf and stem tissues at raising nd levels with up to  <dig>  nmol asn g− <dig> fm . highest relative asn increase was established within the low nd level especially in leaf and, to a lower extent in stem . allocation of nt to the asparagine pool reached a tremendous range among  <dig> and 2151 nmol nt. in addition, the impact of dark exposure on the amino acid accumulation coincided with nitrogen fluxes to the asparagine, aspartate and arginine pools, which hold up to 77 % of aa-nt in the leaf, while stem tissue contained up to 74 % of the aa-nt as glutamine and asparagine.fig.  <dig> change of proteinogenic amino acids in leaf and stem base with cuttings of petunia hybrida in response to graduated nitrogen fertilisation  to donor plants and dark exposure.

change of free amino acids in three different conditions
to investigate the pattern of amino acid changes in leaf and basal stem of cuttings upon dark exposure a factorial design involving three environment treatments of cuttings  and five time points within each environment was studied in more detail . with adequate nd supply excised cuttings  initially contained  <dig> and 9 μmol aa g− <dig> fm in stem and leaf tissues, respectively . the immediate perlite insertion for rooting under diurnal light resulted at  <dig> hpe in significant aa reduction followed at  <dig> hpe by a significant recovery in leaf and stem . under dark exposure, the aa levels initially declined slightly in stem and remained unchanged in leaf until  <dig> hpe. prolonged dark exposure raised aa strongly up to  <dig> hpe in stem and leaf , respectively . when dark pre-exposed cuttings were planted  and exposed to diurnal light this was followed by a 3- and 7-fold aa reduction in stem and leaf tissues, respectively . altogether, increase and decrease rates of aa in leaf exceeded those in stem tissue .fig.  <dig> course of total and single amino acids in leaf and stem base of petunia hybrida cuttings exposed to three environment conditions – immediately planted for rooting, under dark exposure, planted for rooting after dark – and sampled at five exposition times , respectively. panels a to r: full cycles and open squared symbols connected with full and intermittent lines represent leaf and steam base tissues, respectively. total  amino acids are given as μmol g− <dig> fm and single amino acids as nmol g− <dig> fm, respectively. multifactorial anova’s revealed significant interaction effects for environment condition × exposition time × tissue type p <  <dig>  to p <  <dig>  . vertical bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of mean values. further details of experiments and statistics are presented in methods and with additional file 1) experiments of nitrogen preconditioning of cuttings, additional file 2) explanation of experimental designs for statistical analyses and additional file 3) supplemental data of figure  <dig> for exp. 5: aa-dcr, respectively




at time of cutting excision, among free amino acids, glutamine was initially  highest in the stem base . the immediate insertion for rooting initiated strong gln reduction to lowest levels in leaf  and stem base . until  <dig> hpe gln recovered in leaf to initial levels but only slightly in stem . the dark exposure of cuttings  reduced gln concentration in stem base by 36 % until  <dig> hde and decreased it to low initial levels in the leaf . the rooting after dark caused transient gln increases in stem and leaf followed by a reduction in both tissues to lowest levels at  <dig> hpe .


asparagine was low in stem base and leaf tissue . a direct insertion for rooting caused asn reduction in stem and remained at low levels in leaf . during the first day of dark exposure asn decreased slightly in stem base and increased moderately in the leaf. in contrast, further dark exposure  resulted in an increase of asn up to 23-fold in leaf, starting before  <dig> hde and 4-fold in stem starting after  <dig> hde . an insertion of dark exposed cuttings led to no change of asn in stem base up to  <dig> hpin and to a slight decrease in leaf  and strongly decreased, thereafter, both in stem  and leaf  and reached lowest levels at  <dig> hpin . arginine was low  in stem base and leaf tissue and remained unchanged until  <dig> hpe . dark exposure did not change arg significantly in stem while it increased strongly up to 9-fold until 7d  . with subsequent rooting after dark period arg reduction was evident in both stem and leaf during the first day. in the further course, arg remained at low levels in stem while a 10-fold reduction of arg occurred in leaf tissue .


glutamate accumulated in stem at lower levels when compared to leaf  . a direct insertion for rooting resulted in a slight increase of glu only in leaf and was reduced in both tissues to a transient minimum at day one, and restored finally beyond initial levels. dark exposure resulted in transient increase of glu at  <dig> hpe in leaf  while it remained unchanged in stem . with rooting after dark treatment, continuous glu reduction was observed in the leaf whereas, in stem glu declined only between  <dig> and  <dig> hpe .


aspartate started at low levels . with direct rooting asp elevated only in leaf , decreased  <dig> hpe transiently in stem and leaf, and increased  <dig> hpe beyond initial levels . at dark exposure, asp did not change at  <dig> hde in the stem, rose at  <dig> hde to a temporary peak and decreased finally to initial levels. in the leaf, asp increased immediately until  <dig> hde to a maximum , decreased at  <dig> hde to a minimum  and ended at  <dig> hde in a 2-fold increase  . during rooting after dark treatment, asp remained unchanged in the leaf at  <dig> hpe and resulted in a continual decrease afterwards. in stem base, a reduction of asp was followed by a peak at  <dig> hpe and decreased to lowest levels in all three environment conditions .

course of soluble protein during ar formation
soluble protein was examined in cuttings during ar formation under diurnal light. environmental influence was assayed in a factorial design and included nd supply levels to donor plants, dark exposure of cuttings, five time points after planting onto perlite for ar formation  and two tissues . a direct insertion started at  <dig> hpe at  <dig> -fold higher protein in leaf versus stem  . then, its transient decrease in stem coincided at  <dig> hpin with an increase in leaf and rose at  <dig> hpin accordingly in both tissues to highest levels. in contrast, dark exposed cuttings  at insertion  showed elevated protein in leaf only  followed by a decrease at  <dig> hpin  and dropped to a level as in freshly excised cuttings . a direct insertion started  <dig> hpe at similar protein level for both nd levels and increased continuously for  <dig> hpin . in dark exposed cuttings , protein was increased at insertion  but did not differ for ndlevels. however, at  <dig> hpin the low nd supply resulted in a transient protein raise  while it remained unchanged at high nd supply for  <dig> hpin. thereafter, protein with both nd levels dropped for  <dig> hpin to levels as in freshly excised cuttings .fig.  <dig> course of soluble protein in leaf and stem base with cuttings of petunia hybrida, grown at two nd fertilisation levels  to donor plants and exposed to different environment conditions – immediately planted for rooting and planted for rooting after dark – and sampled at five exposition times . : full cycles and open squared symbols connected with full and intermittent lines represent ar formation for  <dig> hpin directly after excision  and after dark exposure of cuttings , respectively. multifactorial anova’s revealed significant interaction effects for nd-level × dark exposure × exposition time p <  <dig>  , for dark exposure × exposition time x tissue type . vertical bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of mean values. further details of experiments and statistics are presented in methods and with additional file 1) experiments of nitrogen preconditioning of cuttings, additional file 2) explanation of experimental designs for statistical analyses and additional file 3) supplemental data of figure  <dig> for exp. 8: pr-ndcr, respectively




discussion
early events of ar formation were delayed upon reduced nt contents
based on anatomical characteristics, the ar formation in petunia has been divided in the root initiation phase, the root primordium formation phase and the root elongation and/or emergence phase  <cit> . in the present investigation, two time points of ar formation have been chosen for the histological examination, the transition from the root initiation to the root primordium formation phase  and the root primordium formation to the root elongation phase . the results show that the course of ar formation at  <dig> hpin is similar to that reported by ahkami et al.  <cit> , irrespective of nitrogen treatment . at later stage  first roots were observed only in the treatment with high nitrogen level . interestingly, this observation could not be confirmed with low nitrogen  demonstrating that a critical level of nitrogen is necessary to ensure proper root initiation and a subsequent differentiation into the complete body of the root. delayed root formation at low nitrogen supply is most likely due to a regulation of root development and metabolic adaptations via nutrients and hormones  <cit> . it has already been reported that an early transient rise in iaa and no triggered anatomical changes for both ar and lr formation  <cit>  and involved basipetal auxin transport before earliest cytological events of ar formation in petunia  <cit> .

mobile nitrogen resources raised at elevated nt contents
the ranges of total nitrogen accumulation in cuttings of axillary shoot tips of petunia hybrida are comparable to published results for chrysanthemum, pelargonium and petunia  <cit> . an increased nt absorption resulted in higher allocation towards soluble nf-pools while the allocation to insoluble protein-n decreased. however, along with increased nt contents petunia cuttings accumulated more nitrate- and amide-n than amino-n . planting of cuttings and subsequent exposure to diurnal light induced tremendous nt decreases during initial rootless stages indicating that all nf-pools contributed to ar formation .

shoot growth during ar formation responds to nt and dark exposure
a higher nitrogen content enhanced shoot dry mass accumulation by 10 % what is comparable to earlier reports  <cit> . direct rooting  caused the most significant dry mass increase throughout until  <dig> hpin. in contrast, after a temporary dark experience  the subsequent shoot growth under diurnal light  was mostly reduced at a low initial n absorption of cuttings . considering the simultaneous dark stimulation of ar formation with a low n absorption , this stays in accordance with the finding that dark exposure enhances the sink competitiveness of the rooting zone resulting in a higher proportion of dry mass allocation towards developing roots  <cit> .

increased n absorption and dark treatment improves ar formation
the parameters of ar formation  were notably decreased at a lower nd supply and reduced nt absorption . this coincides with reports of a nitrogen limitation of ar formation in chrysanthemum, pelargonium, poinsettia and petunia  <cit> . in the present study, ar formation in petunia was even reduced at low nd supply  when nt diminished just slightly below the recommended nt-range between 2750–5429 μmol nt  <cit>  . then, cuttings revealed no phenotype above the critical level for deficiency symptoms of 1471 μmol nt  <cit> . the dark stimulation of ar formation  supported earlier data of an increased, accelerated and synchronized rooting after dark exposure  <cit> . however, low and high initial nt levels confirmed the high n effect on ar formation only as long as no dark exposure was applied .

nitrogen allocation mirrors nt contents, dark exposure and period during ar formation
nutrient concentrations, in particular nitrate, amino acids and nt rapidly declined at early phases of ar formation indicating a high n demand  <cit> . as dark stimulation of ar formation involved a strong dark induced carbohydrate starvation  <cit>  it further implied concurrent n fluxes obviously contributing to improved n availability in the rooting zone meeting the high n demand at early rootless phases  <cit> . although darkness did not change nt it reduced insoluble protein-n at both nd supply levels  and warranted fluxes of released n into soluble amino-n and amide-n pools . this is in accordance with the reports that prolonged darkness affects proteolytic systems of cellular compartments and activates protein breakdown in response to carbohydrate starvation  <cit> . thereby, total n and the nitrate-nf pool remains unaffected from darkness  since darkness prevents photosynthesis and concomitantly inactivates nitrate reductase and n assimilation  <cit> .

amino acids show specific patterns for raised nitrogen nutrition and dark exposure
the amino acid levels in petunia increased with both enhanced nd supply and dark exposure differing however, for both leaf and stem . dark treatment was an exception among the other variation sources . interestingly, leaf dark treatment led to highest amino acid concentration with excess nd supply while amino acids in stem increased significantly, most of all with the low nd supply. recent reports showed that nd supply is a pivotal external factor that initiates synthesis and raises amino acids along with internal nitrogen levels and altered gene transcription . amino acid levels also changed within different tissues and responded to other external factors as irradiance level, temperature shift and carbohydrate supply  <cit> . here, an increase of aa in leaf was dependent on the amount of nitrogen supplied with glu, asp and gln as major and arg as minor amino acids . in contrast, in stem an enhanced nd supply resulted in high gln level  and low levels of glu and asn. these results are in agreement with previously reported data with gln as predominant amino acid followed by glu, asn and asp in the stem of petunia and of other plant species  <cit> . a shift in the exogenous supply from high to excess nd caused a stagnation  or a slight decrease  of stem amino acids . this might be caused by an osmotic interference along with soil salt accumulation after excess n fertigation . in this regard it was reported that the salt stres repressed long distance amino acid transport specifically in stem tissue  <cit> .

although dark exposure elevated aa in leaf and stem, single amino acids responded differently in each tissue. a general shift in n metabolism coincided with a strong carbohydrate starvation  <cit> . the dark-induced increases of aa mainly comprised elevated asn, asp and arg levels with tissue specific responses at the different nd supply levels . this is also strongly supported by reports that leaves senescing in the dark showed increases in asparagine and other amino acids  <cit> . further, this is strengthened by data showing that in different plants asparagine synthetase genes  are repressed by light and activated by dark. moreover, as genes are inversely correlated with carbohydrate levels in plants while exogenous sucrose repressed as root gene expression . therefore, accumulation of free asparagine and arginine - having high nitrogen to carbon ratios - are assumed to serve as n storage compounds which buffer critical ammonium release in darkness. the ammonium release results from dark-induced proteolysis and amino acid deamination and is driven by accelerated respiratory carbohydrate demands for tissue survival during darkness  <cit> . interestingly, the dark-induced increase of asp was highest at a low nd supply level in both leaf and stem tissues . this corresponds to an increase of asp found in response to low nitrogen stress among numerous metabolic adaptions in maize leaves  <cit> . however, while asn, asp and arg increased with dark exposure, the glu levels contrarily decreased in both tissues . gln disappeared with dark exposure at high and excess nd supply in leaf but remained unchanged in stem . in contrast, stem tissues of low n cuttings showed elevated gln in response to dark exposure. taken together, under conditions of n deficiency  the dark-induced increases of gln and asp were observed especially along with an aa rise in the stem . this might reflect an elevated dark-induced activity for n remobilisation by a temporary accumulation of metabolite precursors of asn synthesis like asp and gln  <cit> . in this regard, it was reported that protein degradation results in an increase in the gln-synthetase/glu-synthase  cycle and that amounts of glu and gln increased, although overall amino acids decreased with n deficiency  <cit> .

course of amino acids responded to distinct environment situations
considering high and adequate nd supply to donor plants, levels of aa and single amino acids displayed comparable ranges in two independent experiments . along with aa, gln and asn showed initial reductions in stem base up to  <dig> hpin , while glu and asp in stem base turned around to recover before  <dig> hpin . the amino acid changes in stem base are in agreement with the metabolic phases for sink establishment, recovery and maintenance suggested by ahkami et al.  <cit> . with high nd supply, the levels of amino acids changed differently in all tissues and conditions examined. especially, at the end of dark exposure  tissue specific alterations of aa, gln, asn and arg were obvious . furthermore, the respective courses of aa and single amino acids at earlier time points imply a switch in transcriptional regulation of amino acid metabolism  caused by the low energy status  <cit>  and with a dark induced carbohydrate depletion in leaf tissue  <cit> . moreover, a subsequent basipetal allocation of amino acids  might be induced with a preferred early sink establishment in the stem base region of root regeneration  <cit> . sink cell development strongly depends upon nitrogen which is transported mainly as gln or asn, and to lesser amounts as glu or asp via the phloem  <cit> . however, during darkness n-rich amino acids  accumulated in the leaf  preventing ammonia toxification and using arg as precursor for a supposed no signal cascade in early phases of ar formation  <cit> . the immediate and strong rise in asp level in leaf before  <dig> hde until  <dig> hde  and the subsequent increase in glu level from 24hde until 72hde  indicate a reprogramming of amino acid metabolism in darkness. in arabidopsis, an induction of genes encoding enzymes of the asparagine biosynthetic pathway, such as glutamate dehydrogenase  <dig>  aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate synthase and asparagine synthetase was found during 8d of dark exposure  <cit> . further, it was reported that nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase is essential for plant survival during dark-induced carbon starvation  <cit> . finally, a reciprocal regulation of asparagine synthetase genes by light and metabolites such as glutamine was shown  <cit> . this is in agreement with the decrease in courses of amino acid levels during ar formation under diurnal light and after the dark exposure  when carbohydrate biosynthesis was re-established  <cit> .

soluble proteins undergo proteolysis in senescence
during cutting propagation developmental and abiotic stress signals include wounding, dark exposure and root induction with e.g. changing internal n resources. thereby, reconvalescence and survival after senescence  and ar formation depend on transcriptomic and metabolic adjustments to low energy status involving proteolysis and new protein synthesis  <cit> . in our study, soluble protein elevated during 7d  in both stem and leaf and at high and low nd supply . suzuki and kohno  <cit>  suggested that nitrogen required by the growing parts  in the stem base comes from protein breakdown in source tissues . however, strong decreases of insoluble protein indicate n mobilisation during ar formation under diurnal light . at the two n levels proteolysis started  <dig> hpin and concurred with ~2-fold soluble protein rise .

in contrast, the pre-rooting dark exposure of cuttings likely involved an artificially, reversible senescence and transcriptome changes  <cit>  that induced strong protein degradation  <cit>  and changed amino acid metabolism under low energy stress  <cit> . this can explain the high ~ 4-fold transient elevation of soluble protein especially in the leaf and at low n levels . dark-induction of proteases in source tissues and corresponding sink establishment in the rooting zone with following enhanced flux of assimilates under subsequent light  <cit>  could comprise degradation of chloroplast proteins like rubisco  <cit>  and involve senescence-associated vacuoles  <cit> , that release peptides and amino acids for phloem upload and transport to new sinks in basal stem  <cit> . this explains the positive correlation between proteins, amino acids as well as nt and ar formation in petunia , minirose  <cit>  and chrysanthemum  <cit> . while protein degradation contributes to auxin signalling by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit>  proteolyses selectively involve ubiquitin ligases  that control cell cycle by targeting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors  <cit>  and thus influence lateral root and ar development  <cit> . hence dark stress might modulate auxin-mediated cell cycle progress and accelerate ar formation in petunia  <cit> .

darkness induces the accumulation of free amino acids
based on our findings, a model for dark induced accumulations of free amino acids is presented . extended darkness results in carbohydrate depletion by rapid glycolysis and low energy status triggering the proteolysis and amino acid catabolism with glutamate as primary amino acid. by the action of aspartate-aminotransferase  = glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase  the amino group  of glutamate is transferred to oxaloacetate  producing aspartate and alpha-ketoglutaric acid . this is supported by the accumulation of aspartate  and glutamate  . further, nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase  deaminates glutamate to oxoglutarate and free nh4+ which in turn is captured by cytosolic glutamine-synthetase  to produce glutamine and glutamate being exported to sink tissues. glutamine and aspartate are used by asparagine synthetase to generate glutamate and asparagine  while asparagine is exported to sink tissue as a nitrogen resource for ar formation. this process contributes also to the transient accumulation of glutamate   which is again catabolised by gdh to oxoglutarate and free nh4+. to prevent nh4+ accumulation to toxic levels, nh4+ and carbamate are bound by the action of carba-moylphosphat-synthetase  to carbamoylphosphate. finally, arginine accumulated   in the urea cycle and might contribute to endogenous no synthesis which is essential for the iaa signal transduction in ar formation.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of metabolic processes of n-remobilisation during dark-induced proteolysis on carbohydrate depletion. extended darkness results in carbohydrate depletion and low energy status that triggers proteolysis and amino acid catabolism with glutamate as primary amino acid. gdh deaminates glutamate to oxoglutarate and free nh4+ that is captured by cytosolic glutamine-synthetase  to produce glutamine and glutamate. glutamine and aspartate are used by asparagine synthetase to generate glutamate and asparagine. both, asparagine and glutamine are exported to sink tissues as a nitrogen resource. arginine accumulates in the urea cycle to prevent nh4+ accumulation to toxic levels. enzymes: gdh – glutamate-dehydrogenase, gs – glutamine-synthetase, asn – asparagine-synthetase, got – glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase = aspat – aspartate-aminotransferase, ass – argininosuccinate-synthetase, asl – argininosuccinate-lyase, argah – arginine-amidohydrolase, oct – ornithin-carbamoyl-transferase, cps – carbamoylphosphat-synthetase; metabolites: α-kg – α-ketoglutarate, oaa – oxaloacetic acid, cp – carbamoylphosphate, ct – carbamate; ● – transport protein in cell membrane, black arrow – dark exposure, blue arrow – no dark





CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we first demonstrated that enhanced nitrogen concentrations of cuttings did not modify the establishment of new root meristematic cells until 72 h. however, subsequently, an enhanced nt of cuttings accelerated further early anatomical events of differentiation during ar formation in the stem base until 168 h, which was followed by a strong rise in the number of emerged ars and their total length at 384 h. also, dark exposure stimulated ar formation in cuttings and this was most pronounced with a low nt. the results further clearly showed, that the graduated nd supply to donor plants and a dark exposure of cuttings changed the accumulation of nt and n allocations to metabolite pools like soluble protein, amino n and major amino acids of the primary n metabolism as glu, gln, asp, asn and arg in stem and leaf tissues, respectively. in this regard, developmental and reversible senescence adaptations of n metabolism with remobilization of nitrogen compounds are shown to facilitate ar formation in cuttings. further analysis of metabolic responses and of the transcriptome including plant hormone related pathways should be combined with functional analysis of candidate factors to disentangle how nitrogen remobilization stimulates ar formation in cuttings. finally, it was concluded that refined strategies for highest propagation rates should include nitrogen fertilization of donor plants and subsequent dark storage of cuttings. for an enhanced survival and rooting capacity improved quality assessment systems are required  <cit> . they can consider amino acid profiles and/or composite nitrogen pools as metabolic indicators of cutting quality along with carbohydrates in the global production chains for young plants.
