BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions are involved in many biological processes such as signal transductions, enzymatic regulations, immunoglobulin recognitions, and allosteric controls  <cit> . a protein recognizes and interacts with its specific partner protein through a special surface region called interface  <cit> . it has been shown that the interfaces and non-interface regions vary in amino-acid composition  <cit> , hydrophobicity  <cit> , and types of secondary structures  <cit> . however, there are few studies characterizing the dynamical properties of interfaces. generally, the thermal fluctuations of residues, one of the most important dynamical properties, could be inferred from the b-factors determined by x-ray crystallography or inferred from the order parameters determined by nuclear magnetic resonance  experiments. the routine experimental procedure usually examine the complete multi-protein assemblies, or protein complexes, therefore, the b-factors or the order parameters from these experiments only reflect the thermal fluctuations of residues in protein complexes. in order to obtain the thermal fluctuations of residues in unbound subunits, which are defined as free subunits without interacting with their partner subunits to form a complete complex, we use computational methods.

molecular dynamics simulation  <cit>  is a powerful method to compute the dynamical properties of proteins by integrating a long time trajectory; normal mode analysis   <cit>  is another common choice to study the average protein dynamics. nevertheless, these two methods are too computationally expensive to be used in the analysis of large datasets  <cit> . the elastic network model and gaussian network model   <cit>  provides a coarse-grained version of nma to compute average dynamical properties of proteins. recently, it has been shown  <cit>  that the thermal fluctuations of a residue can be estimated by some structure-derived properties such as contact number , distance to protein fixed-point , and weighted contact number . the cn model showed that the b-factor is related to the number of noncovalent neighboring atoms within a cut-off distance  <cit> . the pfp model demonstrated that the atoms lying on the same shell centered at the fixed point of the protein tend to have similar b-factors  <cit> . the wcn model reported that the b-factors are quantitatively correlated with its weighted contact number, where the weight being the square of the reciprocal distance between the contacting pair  <cit> . comparing these structure-derived b-factor profiles with the experimental x-ray b-factors, the wcn model predicts better b-factors than cn model, pfp model and gnm  <cit> . take triosephosphate isomerase  as an example, it is shown that the residues with larger b-factors  have smaller wcn , and vice versa. figure s <dig>  compares the normalized b-factor profiles with the normalized reciprocal wcn profiles, showing close association between b-factor and wcn.

since weighted contact number  provides a simple, fast means to estimate the b-factors of residues, we used it to quantify thermal fluctuations for the residues in the unbount subunits. we analyzed the wcn distributions of interface residues in unbound subunits collected from a dataset containing  <dig> non-homologous homodimers  <cit> , and then we analyzed four large datasets of protein complexes that respectively consist of  <dig> homodimers,  <dig> heterodimers,  <dig> obligate complexes, and  <dig> transient complexes. the homodimers and heterodimers were collected from 3d complex  <cit> ; the obligate complexes and transient complexes were collected by weng's group  <cit> . our results showed that the interfaces of the unbound subunits from various complex datasets share same preference: the residues in the central regions  have larger wcn than non-interface residues, while the residues in the peripheral regions  have smaller wcn than non-interface residues. for wcn are negatively related to the thermal fluctuations  <cit> , our results reveal the specific dynamics pattern in the unbound protein-protein interaction interfaces: the central regions consist of rigid residues, while the peripheral regions consist of flexible residues. this finding suggests that protein dynamics might be an important factor for protein-protein interaction.

methods
the weighted contact number 
the weighted contact number of the ith residue is the summation of the square of reciprocal distance between the other neighbor residues in the same chain  <cit> :

 wi=∑j≠in1rij <dig> 

the reciprocal value of wcn has been shown closely related to the thermal fluctuation of a residue  <cit> , so we could estimate the thermal fluctuations of residues from their wcn. in order to obtain the thermal fluctuations of residues in the unbound subunits, only the residues in the same subunit were considered as neighbor residues when we evaluated the wcn of each residue. since the partner subunits in a complex were not used in the calculation, the wcn would only reflect the thermal fluctuations of residues in unbound subunits. figure 1b shows the wcn of residues in an unbound subunit from a thymidylate synthase.

it should be noticed that based on the equation, the size of protein has influence on wcn. in order to compare wcn among protein subunits with various sizes, we normalized the wcn to its corresponding z-scores: z=w-w¯σw for each protein subunit, where w¯ and σw were the mean and standard deviation of the wcn based on all the surface residues in an unbound subunit. by the above procedures, and the average normalized wcn was denoted as 〈z〉. for a global analysis, wcn were not normalized for each individual subunits but normalized for the whole residues in a dataset, and this normalized wcn was denoted by zwcn. therefore, the average normalized wcn was denoted as 〈zwcn〉 for a global analysis. in summary, high wcn residues are more rigid while low wcn residues are more flexible.

definition of protein-protein interfaces and the subregions of interface
the surface residues of a protein subunit were those residues whose solvent accessible surface area is not zero in the unbound subunit, where the solvent accessible surface areas of residues were calculated by the program dsspcmbi  <cit>  with a water molecule radius of  <dig>  Å. after that, a surface residue was considered in interface if any of its heavy atoms contact with any other partner proteins within  <dig> Å  <cit> . the interface residues were considered in the central region of interfaces if their relative solvent accessible surface areas in a complex were smaller than or equal to 5%, and were called cnetral interface residues; the rest of interface residues were considered as peripheral interface residues. the relative solvent accessible surface area of a residue was equal to its real accessibility dividing by maximal accessibility  <cit> . figure 1a illustrates the central interface residues  and peripheral interface residues  in the unbound subunit, while the non-interface residues are drawn grey. the surfaces and interfaces are drawn with pymol.

to compare the difference of wcn distributions among different regions on the surface of unbound subunits, we compared their average normalized wcns, denoted by 〈z〉n, 〈z〉c, and 〈z〉p, where n, c, and p stand for non-interface, central interface and peripheral interface, respectively. if the normalization is global, the average normalized wcn were denoted by 〈zwcn〉n, 〈zwcn〉c, and 〈zwcn〉p.

datasets of protein-protein interactions
we used the  <dig> non-homologous  protein homodimers  <cit>  to show the wcn distributions of residues in different surface subregions. in this dataset, all structures are determined by x-ray crystallography except interleukin  <dig> . for this nmr structure, we used the first model for our analysis. three pdb structures 2sdh, 2ssi, 3gap were obsolete and were substituted with 3sdh, 3ssi, 1g6n respectively. table s <dig> shows the list of protein-protein interaction pairs in this homodimer data set.

in addiction, we compared the wcn distributions in homodimers with the distributions in heterodimers. there are  <dig> non-redundant homodimers  and  <dig> heterodimers  selected from 3dcomplex  <cit>  database with sequence identity threshold of 20%. in order to compare the wcn distributions of different surface regions by student t-test, the unbound subunits that have only one or zero central interface residue were removed.

we also applied wcn on obligate and transient complexes. the non-redundant structural dataset manually separated into  <dig> obligate complexes and  <dig> transient complexes  <cit> , whose sequence identity are smaller than 25%. the unbound subunits that have less than one central interface residues were removed because the wcn distributions were compared by student t-test. table s <dig> and s <dig> respectively list the unbound subunits from obligate and transient complexes.

RESULTS
characteristics of datasets
there are five protein complex datasets used in this study and are summarized in table s <dig>  for the residues in these various datasets, 87% to 89% residues are on the protein surfaces; among these surface residues, 12% to 20% are in the interfaces. the percentages of interface residues on the surfaces are similar for homodimers  and heterodimers , but are slightly different between obligate complexes  and transient complexes . considering the interface residues, about one-third of the residues were in the central regions. the proportions of residues in the central regions of interfaces are similar for homodimers  and heterodimers , but are different between obligate and transient complexes . our analysis suggests that the interfaces in obligate complexes tend to be larger than interfaces in transient complexes. moreover, the central interface regions in obligate complexes tend to be larger than those in transient complexes if their interface sizes are the same.

wcn distributions of residues from different surface subregions
we performed the student's t-test to evaluate the differences among these normalized wcn distributions, denoted by zwcn, by matlab. both the p-values of zwcnc - zwcnn and zwcnp - zwcnn are smaller than  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and the p-value of zwcnc - zwcnp is even as small as  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  indicating that the central interface residues have significantly larger wcn than non-interface residues, and the peripheral residues have significantly smaller wcn than non-interface residues.

besides the average wcn values of residues for the whole dataset, we calculated the average wcn values of residues in different surface subregions of each individual unbound subunit, denoted by 〈z〉c, 〈z〉p and 〈z〉n, where c, p and n represented central, peripheral, and non-interface regions. we found that 〈z〉c is larger than 〈z〉p in all  <dig> unbound subunits from the  <dig> homodimers . when compared with 〈z〉n, 〈z〉p is smaller than 〈z〉n in 91% interfaces , and 〈z〉c is larger than 〈z〉n in 75%  interfaces . these results showed that the relationship between the average wcns from different surface subregions holds not only for all the residues across the datasets, but also for the residues in every unbound subunit.

in addiction, we analyzed a larger dataset comprising  <dig> non-homologous homodimers collected from 3d complex  <cit> . the wcn distributions of central and peripheral interface residues  are similar as those in the  <dig> homodimers dataset . the relationship among central interface residues, non-interface residues and peripheral interface residues can be expressed as the inquality: 〈zwcn〉c > 〈zwcn〉n > 〈zwcn〉p, where 〈zwcn〉y denotes the average normalized wcn in the surface subregion y . our results suggested that a homodimer interface are composed of residues with larger wcn surrounded by residues with smaller wcn, and the average packing density of non-interface residues are between those of the central and peripheral interface residues.

n, c, and p denote non-interfaces, central interfaces and peripheral interfaces. 〈zwcn〉x is the average value of normalized wcn collected from all residues in subregion × in a data set. 〈〈z〉x〉 is the mean of 〈z〉x, which is the average value of normalized wcn collected from residues in subregion × in an unbound subunit.

the wcn distributions of homodimeric interfaces and heterodimeric interfaces
we used the  <dig> heterodimers dataset collected from 3d complex  <cit>  to compare the wcn distributions of interface residues between homo- and heterodimers. the distributions of different surface subregions from heterodimers are shown in figure 2d. as we can see from the figures, these distributions are quite similar between homo- and heterodimers. figure 3c and 3d show that central interface residues tend to have larger wcn than peripheral interface residues, the same as the cases from homodimers. for the homodimers dataset, the average value of wcn of central interface residues 〈zwcn〉c =  <dig>  is significantly larger than that of peripheral interface residues 〈zwcn〉p = - <dig>  ; for the heterodimers dataset, the average value of wcn of central interface residues 〈zwcn〉c =  <dig>  is also significantly larger than that of peripheral interface residues 〈zwcn〉p = - <dig>  . as the cases for homodimers and heterdimers, the average values of wcn of non-interface residues are between the average values of central and peripheral interface residues.

the above result is from global analysis. when comparing packing density distribution subunit-by-subunit,  <dig> % unbound interfaces  from the  <dig> homodimers dataset obeyed the inequality 〈z〉c > 〈z〉p , where 〈z〉c and 〈z〉p were the average values of central and peripheral interface residues in a unbound subunit ; moreover,  <dig> % unbound interfaces  from the  <dig> heterodimers dataset also obeyed the same inequality . these results indicated that both homo- and heterodimer interfaces were composed of residues with larger wcn in the central regions surrounded by residues with smaller wcn in the peripheral regions .

comparing homodimeric interfaces with heterodimerics interfaces, the former have smaller 〈zwcn〉c than the later . these results implied that the central residues in homodimers have less neighbors than those in heterodimers. as the complex are usually symmertric for homodimers, the interface residues are in the center of the complexes. hence, the interfaces are usually more flat than other surface regions, so the neighbor residues are only in half of the space divided by the interface plane. in contrast, a heterodimer usually consist of one large subunit with concave interface and one small subunit with convex interface. thus, the number of neighbors for a central residue in concave interface would be more than that in flat interface, and this causes the higher wcn in the large subunits. although with the same deduction the wcn is smaller in the small subunits, the number of central residues in a large subunit is more than that in a small subunit. therefore, the finally 〈zwcn〉c of heterodimers is larger than 〈zwcn〉c of homodimers.

the wcn distributions of interfaces in obligate complexes and transient complexes
both the  <dig> obligate complexes and  <dig> transient complexes collected by mintseris et al.  <cit>  have the same trend in wcn distribution as the dimers : their central interface residues tended to have larger wcn than peripheral residues . analyzing each interface of unbound protein subunits from  <dig> obligate complexes,  <dig> % unbound interfaces  obeyed the inequality 〈z〉c > 〈z〉p ; for  <dig> transient complexes,  <dig> % unbound interfaces  obeyed this inequality . these results indicated that both obligate and transient interfaces are also composed of residues with larger wcn in the central regions surrounded by residues with smaller wcn in the peripheral regions .

comparing obligate interaction with transient, the obligate complexes significantly differed from transient complexes in 〈zwcn〉c , implying that the central regions of the unbound interfaces in transient complexes are more rigid than those in obligate complexes. this phenomenon could be explained by the reason that many transient interfaces were composed of catalytic sites, and for an enzyme/ligand complexes, which are transient complexes, and previous studies have shown that the active sites are proximal to the protein centroid  <cit>  so that the active sites are expected to be more rigid  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
for the interface subregions in unbound protein subunits, our analyses showed the distinct distributions of packing density, suggesting distinct thermal fluctuation. these distinct thermal fluctuations reveal specific dynamics pattern in unbound interface: interface regions consist of rigid residues in the central regions, and the peripheral regions consist of flexible residues. this specific dynamical feature appear in various protein complexes including homodimers, heterodimers, obligate complexes, and transient complexes, based on the average packing density of surface subregions with 〈zwcn〉c > 〈zwcn〉n > 〈zwcn〉p .

previous studies have divided an interface into buried region  and exposed region  upon complexation, and have found that this two regions vary in sequential, structural, and evolutionary features such as amino acid composition, degree of sequence entropy and sequence conservation  <cit> , and secondary structure propensity  <cit> . our results also present that the unbound interfaces have distinct distributions of packing density when dividing an interface into buried region  and exposed region . sine previoius studies  <cit>  have shown the structure-dynamics relationship between the packing density and thermal fluctuation, our finding implied specific dynamics pattern in the interfaces of unbound protein subunits. for characterizing a specific interface by a combination of interface parameters is suitable  <cit> , combining the specific dynamical feature with sequential and structural features might help us to more understanding in protein-protein interaction.

the mechanism for protein-protein association was reviewed that a temporary complex is formed through nonspecific collisions guided mostly by electrostatic interactions, and then this temporary complex reorientates to form its final structure guided mostly by desolvation  <cit> . the rate of this association is modulated by the perturbations in charge distribution  <cit> , and our results suggested that these perturbations may arise from the flexibility of the charged or polar residues in the peripheral interfaces. on the other hand, it has been shown that hydrophobicity stabilizes protein-protein interactions, and geometric and electrostatic complementarity plays a selective role in deciding which proteins could interact with each other  <cit> , and our results suggested that these specific interactions may arise from the rigidity of the residues in the central interfaces. in conclusion, our findings implied that the flexibility of peripheral interface residues facilitates a protein to capture the candidates of its interaction partners by the perturbations in charge distribution, and then the rigidity of central interface residues helps the protein to select the exact partner by structural and physicochemical complementary. finally, this interaction is stabilized by hydrophobic effect. however, resolving these issues is beyond the scope of the present report. to sum up, our results suggested that the dynamics might be an important feature for the formation of protein complexes.
