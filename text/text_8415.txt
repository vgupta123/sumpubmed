BACKGROUND
protein kinases in plants have been found to be involved in basic features of plant defense and plant fertilization. increasing knowledge about the underlying molecular mechanisms suggests several parallels between both processes  <cit> . plant-pathogen recognition has been studied extensively in tomato in which gene for gene resistance against certain pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strains is conferred by the serine/threonine kinase pto. upon recognition of bacterial avirulence factors, pto acts in concert with the prf protein resulting in the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways culminating in the induction of defense responses including hr  <cit> . several pto-interacting  proteins were identified to act in pto-mediated signal transduction including the protein kinase pti <dig> and three transcription factors , respectively  <cit> . pti <dig>  is a cytoplasmic protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation in vitro  <cit>  and moreover also be phosphorylated by pto. tobacco plants over-expressing s1pti show enhanced hr in leaves in response to avirulence factor treatment indicating a functional role of slpti <dig> in pto-mediated disease response  <cit> . however, a precise role of slpti <dig> in plant pathogen resistance has remained unclear, owing to functional redundancy of different/additional pti <dig> kinases. three slpti <dig> homologous kinases have been cloned from soybean  <cit> , spti1a, spti1b and gmpti <dig>  the former two do not display in vitro autophosphorylation activity  <cit> , whereas the latter, gmpti <dig>  possesses autophosphorylation activity. gmpti <dig> gene expression was found to accelerate in response to wounding and salicylic acid treatment in seedling leaves  <cit> . these findings suggest different pti1-like kinases to possess different properties and biological functions in plants.

cell-cell recognition and signal response reactions during plant-pathogen interaction are thought to be molecularly related to certain steps of plant reproduction, e.g. pollen-pistil recognition, compatibility reactions, and pollen tube growth. in studies of the genetic and molecular basis of pollen development and function more than  <dig> pollen-expressed genes from more than  <dig> species have been identified  <cit> . classification of pollen expressed genes identified a high number of genes which are involved in signal transduction. many of these genes encode putative protein kinases  <cit> . accordingly, leucine-rich repeat  ser/thr-type plant receptor kinases  leprk <dig> to  <dig> from tomato and several interacting proteins like kpp, lat <dig> and leshy have already been attributed to signaling processes during pollen tube growth  <cit> .

mutations of a number of such gametophytically important genes often result in altered mendelian segregation ratios due to an abolished or reduced transmission of a linked marker through pollen. such genes include sec <dig>  rop <dig>  limpet pollen and ttd genes  <cit> . most of these mutations cause obvious defects in the pollen grain and affect early stages of pollen development. in contrast, only few mutations are known that are transmitted through the male at low frequencies but cause no obvious defects in pollen morphology. these genes appear to affect more pollen competitiveness rather than development, e.g. ttd <dig> and rop <dig>  <cit> .

in this study we report the identification and molecular analyses of four pti <dig> kinases from maize . the genes were expressed in different tissues and showed different subcellular localizations. phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of three conserved pti <dig> kinase subgroups in higher plants. based on its sequence similarity, expression profile and subcellular localization zmpti1b was suggested to be a putative slpti <dig> ortholog. in contrast, the functional kinase zmpti1a was specific to pollen and targeted to the plasma membrane, evidently owing to n-terminal acylation. zmpti1a co-localizes with regions of callose deposition at stages of pollen maturation and germination. silencing of the zmpti1a gene resulted in a significant decrease in the competitive ability of pollen. these findings provide evidences of zmpti1a to play an important role in influencing pollen fitness.

our data further suggest that pti <dig> kinases from maize act in various tissues and in different but mechanistically conserved plant response pathways which likely involve similar signals and/or signal transduction molecules.

RESULTS
pti1-like kinases of maize
a  <dig> bp partial cdna of zmpti1a was cloned in a molecular approach with the aim to identify genes that are specifically expressed in maize pollen. using this clone as a hybridization probe, two nearly identical  <dig>  kb full-length cdnas  were isolated from a λ-cdna library of in vitro germinated pollen from white pollen  plants  <cit>  expressing the c <dig> gene. both cdnas probably represent different alleles of the same gene. the cdna clone ay <dig> was further analyzed in this study. ay <dig> contains an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp, a  <dig> bp 5' untranslated region and a  <dig> bp 3' untranslated region including a poly+ tail. the putative protein of ay <dig> is  <dig> amino acids  in length with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda . database search revealed 69% identity and 75% similarity to the pto-interactor  <dig>  protein kinase of solanum lycopersicum  <cit> . therefore the cloned gene was named zea mays pti1a . the putative catalytic kinase domain of zmpti1a starts approximately  <dig> aa after the first methionine and contains  <dig> canonical subdomains that are typical of serine/threonine kinases . out of the  <dig> invariant amino acid residues common to the majority of protein kinases,  <dig> were found to be conserved in zmpti1a . a glutamine in subdomain iii is substituted with a glutamate at position  <dig> and a conserved glycine in subdomain vii is substituted with an aspartate at position  <dig>  identical substitutions are present in the kinase slpti <dig>  <cit>  suggesting that zmpti1a is also a functional kinase. a corresponding full-length genomic clone  spanning the entire transcribed region as well as  <dig>  kb of the promoter of zmpti1a was isolated from a λ-phage library of the maize inbred lc by plaque screening and inverse pcr. the gene consists of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns . the nucleotide sequence of the deduced transcribed region was found to be nearly identical to the previously cloned cdnas with the exception of line specific single nucleotide polymorphisms that changed three aa in less conserved regions of the deduced protein. an insertion of  <dig> bp resulted in the addition of three alanine residues in the c-terminus . the proposed translation start is located in exon  <dig>  hybridizing bands in genomic southern analyses with probes specific for the promoter, 5'-utr, orf, and 3'-utr of zmpti1a correlated well with the predicted restriction patterns of the cloned gene and suggested that zmpti1a is a single copy gene .

database search led to the identification of additional ests coding for zmpti1a homologues from maize. these sequences were found to be well conserved at the nucleotide level , and even more conserved at the the protein level . corresponding orf and 3' utrs were amplified by rt-pcr from lines a <dig> and lc, respectively. all cloned sequences were identical to their corresponding est with the exception of few line specific snps. accordingly, these sequences were named zmpti1b , zmpti1c , and zmpti1d , respectively. an est clone  which resembles zmpti1c was annotated previously as a salt-inducible putative serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase . data mining of genomic bac and magi sequences containing zmpti1b and -d indicated that the corresponding genes possess nearly identical exon/intron structures as compared to zmpti1a . this indicates that the maize pti <dig> gene family most likely originates from a single ancestor gene. out of the four putative zmpti <dig> kinases, zmpti1b showed highest protein similarity to pti <dig> from tomato . all zmpti <dig> proteins possess conserved kinase catalytic domains. however, their n – and c-terminal regions are highly variable and only some pti <dig> kinases, including zmpti1a, were predicted to contain a putative myristoylation signal at their n-termini. such protein modifications in which the saturated fatty acid myristate is covalently but reversibly attached to an n-terminal gly after co-translational cleavage of the first met residue can fulfill several functions, e.g. mediating membrane association.

phylogenetic relationship of zmpti kinases
phylogenetic comparison of zmpti <dig> proteins from maize and putative pti <dig> kinases from other plants indicated three major pti <dig> subgroups in angiosperms  with the known maize proteins belonging to subgroups ii and iii, respectively . each subfamily possesses a conserved n-terminal domain with a specific consensus sequence and consists of proteins from mono – as well as dicotyledonous species. the n-terminal domains are rich in polar or aromatic residues and contain at least two conserved cysteines. some of the kinases, e.g. zmpti1a, spti1a, spti1b and at3g <dig> are predicted to contain a putative n-terminal myristoylation signal. gene organization of most of the pti <dig> kinases from arabidopsis thaliana were found to be similar to that of zmpti1a, i.e.  <dig> exons and a predicted translation start in exon  <dig> .

based on these findings, pti <dig> genes appear to represent an ancient kinase family in higher plants. amino acid sequences of the different n-terminal regions are conserved in a broad spectrum of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species . thus, it is feasible to speculate that the conserved n-terminal motifs of the different pti <dig> subfamilies were retained during evolution because of specific relevant biological functions.

zmpti <dig> proteins localize to different subcellular compartments
to investigate the subcellular localization of zmpti <dig> proteins in situ, we transiently expressed in-frame coding sequences of zmpti <dig> kinases fused to green fluorescent protein  in onion epidermal cells and in in vitro germinating pollen, respectively. when expressed under control of the ubiquitin promoter, zmpti1a:gfp was targeted to the cell periphery suggesting zmpti1a to localize to the plasma membrane . this pattern was clearly different from that observed when gfp was expressed alone . association of zmpti1a:gfp with the plasma membrane was also proven by confocal laser scanning microscopy . twenty-four amino acids of the zmpti1a n-terminus were found to be sufficient to target gfp entirely to the cell periphery . truncation of twenty amino acids at the n-terminus of zmpti1a abolished cell periphery targeting coinciding with cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the fusion protein . identical results were observed for these three zmpti1a fusion constructs when expressed ectopically in stably transformed maize plants . these findings are in agreement with the assumption that zmpti1a is targeted to the plasma membrane by n-terminal acylation, likely myristoylation.

to study the structural basis of zmpti1a being targeted to the plasma membrane in detail, potential myristoylation and/or palmitoylation sites, i.e. gly2/cys <dig> and cys6/cys <dig> were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis . conjugation of myristate to proteins is absolutely dependent on a glycine residue at position  <dig> 

exchange of gly <dig> or cys <dig> with ala prevented targeting of the zmpt1a:gfp fusion to the cell periphery. instead, gfp fluorescence appeared in the nucleus and as small cytoplasmic granules . the same gfp pattern was seen when both, cys <dig> and cys <dig>  were replaced by ala .

combined replacement of the adjacent amino acids gly <dig> and cys <dig> with ala residues also caused nuclear localization. however, gfp fluorescence was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and no granules were observed . a similar distribution of gfp fluorescence was observed when cys <dig> and cys <dig> in the second motif were replaced with alanine residues .

these results indicate that combined mutation of single residues in each of the two motifs  resulted in gfp fluorescence associated with cytoplasmic granules. this localization pattern might reflect an imperfect targeting or mistargeting of mutated zmpti1a to membranes. combined replacement of both adjacent residues in either one of the two motifs seems to strengthen mistargeting and completely prevents zmpti1a membrane association.

zmpti1b, c and d from maize and slpti <dig> from tomato naturally lack a gly <dig> residue that would serve as a potential target site of myristoylation . accordingly, zhou et al.  <cit>  predicted the tomato slpti <dig> to be a cytoplasmic kinase. expression of a slpti1:gfp fusion protein confirmed the theoretical prediction however, additionally revealed a nuclear localization . a similar localization pattern was observed for the gfp fusion of zmpti1b, which is the closest slpti1-homologue from maize . by contrast, gfp fusions of zmpti1c and zmpti1d appeared only in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus . both of these sub-group iii proteins contain a conserved n-terminal pair of arginine residues instead of a myristoylation signal. taken together, zmpti <dig> family members show a differential competence for plasma membrane association, evidently owing to their varying susceptibility to n-terminal myristoylation and/or s-acylation.

zmpti <dig> genes are expressed in different maize tissues
gene regulation of the four identified members of the zmpti <dig> family was studied during sporophytic and gametophytic development of maize. we used both, a wild-type and the whp maize line of which the latter produces sterile pollen due to the lack of flavonol synthesis. northern blot analysis revealed a tissue specific expression pattern for zmpti1a with extremely high mrna levels in staminate spikelets  of male inflorescences and in pollen. zmpti1a transcript increased strongly during flower development between  <dig> days before anthesis  and anthesis . even higher transcript amounts were detected in isolated mature pollen harvested at anthesis. since mature pollen and staminate spikelets at anthesis are at the same developmental stage, it is likely that zmpti1a expression in spikelets is mainly due to its specific expression in the enclosed pollen rather than in the surrounding sporophytic tissue.

in contrast to zmpti1a, zmpti1b, c and d were expressed at low levels but in all sporophytic tissue types analyzed. only transcripts of zmpti1c could also be detected in mature and germinated pollen .

because expression of zmpti1b and zmpti1d was absent in mature and germinated pollen, appearance of the corresponding transcripts in all stages of the male flower development may indicate that these genes are preferentially expressed in the sporophytic tissue of the male inflorescence.

in pollen, transcript amounts of zmpti1a and zmpti1c did not differ between the pollen-sterile mutant whp and its corresponding wild-type line  indicating that pollen sterility, due to a lack in flavonoid biosynthesis, did not alter expressions of both zmpti <dig> genes.

taken together, these results showed that three members of the zmpti <dig> family were similarly expressed in the sporophytic maize tissues with zmpti1c also being expressed in pollen. zmpti1a expression differed significantly because of its strong pollen specific expression.

zmpti1b transcript increase in maize kernels after pathogen infection
slpti <dig> from tomato was shown to be involved in hr  <cit> . to investigate if some of the zmpti <dig> genes play a role in pathogen defense, we studied the expression of zmpti <dig> genes in developing maize kernels that were infected with the crop pathogen fusarium graminearum. maize cobs were infected two days after fertilization and harvested at different time points after infection. because fungal infections usually proceed in diverse gradients on infected cobs, kernels were harvested from three regions i.e. top, middle and bottom of individual cobs.

the severeness of fungal infection in these samples was monitored based on the visual rating using the silk channel scale  <cit>  and by rt-pcr detection of a fungal specific β-tubulin mrna . the amounts of amplified β-tubulin cdnas correlated perfectly with the phenotypically visible severity of fungal infection on the cobs.

northern blot analysis revealed a four-fold enhanced zmpti1b transcript level in infected kernels isolated from a cob possessing a disease severity  <dig> indicating 51%–75% of infection . no rna could be extracted from kernels located at the top of this cob because of the advanced mode of fungal infection. previous northern experiments showed that zmpti1b was constitutively expressed during kernel development . therefore, the accelerated zmpti1b expression could be attributed to pathogen infection. no changes of zmpti1b transcript levels were detected in kernels from an uninfected cob or from cobs with less severe disease patterns . owing to the discrepancy of the highly variable mode of fungal infection no conclusions could be drawn from the experiment with respect to the putative time dependence of zmpti1b induction during fusarium infection. however, accelerated zmpti1b expression upon fusarium infection was proven in a second independent experiment .

because the experiments were conducted under non-sterile green house conditions it can not be excluded that weakening of the cob tissues after fusarium infection was a result of additional pathogens, e.g. bacteria, which in turn may have triggered zmpti1b expression. in contrast to zmpti1b, expression of zmpti1c and d was not significantly altered in this experiment.

northern data provided evidence that at least one of the putative maize pti <dig> kinases, zmpti1b, may function in pathogen defense similar to what was previously shown for tomato slpti <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, zmpti1b was identified to be the closest homologue of slpti <dig> among the four identified zmpti <dig> kinases . together with the phylogenic data, this finding supports the hypothesis that related pti <dig> kinases could possess similar biological functions in different plant species.

zmpti1a encodes a functional protein kinase
because of its unusually specific expression in pollen, further investigations were focused on the biological function of zmpti1a. western analysis of various maize tissues using a polyclonal antibody raised against bacterially expressed zmpti1a detected a protein with the expected molecular size of  <dig> kda in mature pollen . faint bands appeared in extracts from staminate spikelets at anthesis and pollinated silks after longer exposure times . no such bands could be detected in other tissues indicating that zmpti1a protein is specifically expressed in pollen. hence, protein expression was shown to correlate well with the abundance of its corresponding mrna.

to ascertain whether zmpti1a encodes a functional protein kinase, purified bacterially expressed zmpti1a protein fused to a his-tag was incubated in buffer containing mn2+ and radiolabelled atp. the in vitro kinase assay revealed zmpti1a to be capable of autophosphorylation . a highly conserved lysine residue in subdomain ii was shown to be necessary for kinase activity of most protein kinases . replacement of this lysine with an asparagine  completely abolished the autophosphorylation of tomato slpti <dig>  <cit> . when the corresponding lysine residue  of zmpti1a was mutated in a similar manner , autophosphorylation was also abolished, indicating that zmpti1a indeed encodes a functional protein kinase  similar to slpti <dig> 

tomato slpti <dig> can physically interact with and be phosphorylated by slpto on serine and threonine residues  <cit> . we hence used bacterially expressed autophosphorylation deficient gst-slpti <dig> and mbp-slpto as positive controls in our experiments . in addition, we tested the ability of tomato slpto to phosphorylate maize zmpti1a in vitro. to distinguish between autophosphorylation of zmpti1a and cross-phosphorylation by slpto, the phosphorylation deficient zmpti1a-his was used as substrate . mbp-slpto could be shown to phosphorylate maize zmpti1a-his. we further tested if zmpti1a-his can cross-phosphorylate tomato slpti <dig>  no significant phosphorylation of gst-slpti <dig> could be detected in this reaction. these results indicate that maize zmpti1a can serve as an in vitro substrate of tomato slpto but is not able to cross-phosphorylate slpti <dig> 

zmpti <dig> serves as a substrate for kinase activities from pollen and silks
to identify upstream kinase activities which use zmpti1a as a substrate, magnetocapture protein interaction assays were performed. immobilized autophosphorylation deficient mutant zmpti1a-his was incubated with native protein extracts from pollen, silks and seedlings, respectively. after removal of unbound proteins by extensive washing, in vitro kinase assays were performed to detect bound kinase activities capable of phosphorylating zmpti1a-his. zmpti1a-his was phosphorylated by proteins enriched from pollen and silk extracts but not from seedlings . as controls, the same pull-down experiments were performed using either autophosphorylation active zmpti1a-his protein or an immobilization matrix that did not contain recombinant proteins. no radioactively labeled proteins were detected in the size range of zmpti1a-his, though silk and seedling extracts showed increased unspecific protein binding to the unloaded matrix. cross-phosphorylation of zmpti1a-his by pollen and silk but not seedling protein could be verified in direct kinase activity assays without upstream pull-down purification of interacting proteins.

auto – and/or cross-phosphorylation of the wild type zmpti1a-his was still detectable after pull-down experiments. however, zmpti1a-his phosphorylation was significantly weaker after incubation with proteins from pollen and silk extracts but unaltered with seedling proteins. one explanation for the reduced phosphorylation of zmpti1a could be the presence of phosphatases or inhibitors of zmpti1a autophosphorylation in pollen and silks extracts.

our experiments provide evidence that pollen and silks contain kinases which bind and phosphorylate zmpti1a in vitro. no such activities were detected in seedling tissue.

zmpti1a:gfp co-localizes with callose deposition in pollen
to study the subcellular localization of zmpti1a in pollen in vivo, we generated transgenic maize lines ectopically expressing zmpti1a:gfp, Δzmpti1a:gfp and myr:gfp, respectively. in each case, pollen was harvested between  <dig> days before anthesis  and anthesis from at least four independent transgenic lines. all plants transformed with a particular construct revealed identical results.

zmpti1a:gfp and myr:gfp localize to the pollen plasma membrane . whereas Δzmpti1a:gfp was present in the cytoplasm and the vegetative nucleus  but absent in the generative nucleus of binucleate developing pollen as well as in sperm cells of trinucleate mature pollen . similar localization patterns were also observed in other tissues of the respective transgenic lines . these results are consistent with the transient localization studies in onion epidermal cells. however, zmpti1a-gfp was not evenly distributed over the plasma membrane but accumulated in a specific region of the pollen. this pattern was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy  and was found to be present in pollen analyzed from all plants of the four independent transgenic lines. the pollen from plants over-expressing the myr-gfp construct showed the same pattern as seen with the zmpti1a-gfp construct, however to a much weaker extent with a more even distribution of the protein. this indicated that the myristoylation signal along with the additional amino acids at the n-terminus can somewhat trigger this phenomenon. however, the entire zmpti1a protein seems to be essential for strong protein accumulation in a specific region of the pollen. a more detailed study of the morphology of this uneven localization of zmpti1a-gfp revealed that zmpti1a-gfp accumulation is closely associated with the pollen aperture . gfp fluorescence was observed below the intine surface as an annulus-ring structure which has a stronger fluorescence in the inner ring of the annulus . it appeared to be localized either adjacent to or surrounding the pollen pore, the former case being more predominantly observed. the position of the adjacent annulus was found to be highly conserved at a 45° angle with respect to the pollen pore.

in search for an explanation of this pattern, we investigated the possibility of zmpti1a:gfp being associated with -β-glucan  by conducting co-localization studies with aniline blue stained transgenic pollen. zmpti1a:gfp pollen stained for callose showed a clear co-localization of callose and gfp with the same intensity pattern, i.e. having stronger fluorescence in the inner ring of the annulus . there was no co-localization of gfp with the callose plug present in the center of the pollen aperture . identical -β-glucan annulus-ring structures were observed in pollen from several wild type lines proving that the ring structure is not an artifact because of ectopic zmpti1a:gfp expression . some pollen showed distinct gfp localization in granules, plates and rings which also co-localized with -β-glucan .

transgenic zmpti1a:gfp pollen germinated on silks as well as on pgm. in germinating transgenic pollen the fusion protein was still sequestered at the plasma membrane adjacent to the pore with only a marginal fluorescence observed in the elongating tube. however, in rare cases, stronger fluorescence signals appeared in the pollen tube bordering callose plugs . plugs are regularly produced behind the tip as tubes elongate to isolate the cytoplasmic contents of the tube from the now empty pollen grain .

zmpti1a:gfp co-localizes with callose during pollen mitosis i
various stages of pollen development were studied to further investigate the co-localization of callose and zmpti1a:gfp.

the first indication of cell plate deposition in the equatorial region of the phragmoplast appeared soon after telophase during pollen mitosis i , taking the normal formation of a flattened aggregate of unit-membrane bounded vesicles. from the earliest presence of these vesicles, the equatorial zone reveals callose fluorescence. this is called the "pre-callose stage". thereafter, the equatorial zone continued to spread at the margins, following the out-spreading phragmoplast, until it forms a complete hemisphere. after the cell-plate formation, callose forms an arch-shaped layer which gradually reached the pollen wall, thus completely separating the generative nucleus from the vegetative nucleus . during the time interval when the generative cell abuts against the wall, callose occurs at the boundary of the cell, however, only on the side adjacent to the vegetative cell. this is called the "callose stage" . following this stage, a rather compact callose stage is observed which is further defining this cell-cell boundary . soon after, the generative cell gradually changes from a lens-like to a spherical shape and moves towards the centre of the pollen grain . this is the "circular shaped prophase generative nucleus with nucleolus stage". in the "spindle shaped prophase generative nucleus with nucleolus stage" it becomes spindle shaped  following the disappearance of callose  <cit> . in the case of maize, the generative cell immediately undergoes a second mitotic division which produces two sperm cells resulting in trinucleate mature pollen.

zmpti1a-gfp fusion protein was found to co-localize with -β-glucan in association with the generative cell until the end of stage iv. when callose disappeared after the end of stage iv, neither the generative cell nor the two sperm cells during further pollen maturation were encased by zmpti1a:gfp fluorescence. however, the fusion protein was present as the previously described annulus-ring structure adjacent to the pore. it appears that the annulus-ring structure may be associated with a similar structure from previous observations of -β-glucan staining during pollen germination  <cit> . however, in our study this structure appeared at all studied stages of pollen development, with increasing intensity during maturation of the pollen grain.

knock down of zmpti1a reduces male specific transmission of the transgene
to decipher the biological function of zmpti1a during pollen development and/or germination, a targeted rna interference  gene silencing approach was utilized. transgenic plants were obtained by biolistic transformation of embryogenic calli and subsequent plant regeneration using the co-transformed phosphinothrycin  resistance gene pat as a selection marker. fifteen out of  <dig> regenerated primary t <dig> plants carried the rnai construct. southern analyses showed that these plants corresponded to  <dig> independent clonal lines. each line contained multi-copy integrations of the rnai construct. southern studies comprising of t <dig> plants and segregating individuals of three subsequent generations indicated that the line specific integration patterns of the transgene were inherited as a single genomic locus . northern analyses with leaf and pollen rna using a transgene-specific probe confirmed expression of the rnai construct in all lines .

the t <dig> plants were reciprocally crossed with the wild type line a <dig>  it was observed in initial experiments that the rnai transgene was not transmitted in the expected mendelian ratio. in order to score for competitive ability of rnai transgenic pollen,  <dig> offspring plants were assayed for ppt-resistance. co-segregation of rnai and ppt transgenes was confirmed by southern analyses of  <dig> ppt-resistant t <dig> individuals.

when transgenic plants were pollinated with wild type pollen, 48% of the t <dig> progeny showed ppt-resistence and carried the rnai transgene, respectively . such an apparent 1: <dig> segregation is expected for a single locus inheritance. when wild type plants were pollinated with pollen of transgenic t <dig> lines, only 20% of the t <dig> progeny was transgenic . since abnormal segregation was only observed with transgenic pollen, the result implied that the transgene was transmitted normally through the female but at a lower frequency through the male.

to confirm the rnai effect on zmpti1a expression, t <dig> plants were subjected to northern and western analysis. zmpti1a transcript and protein levels were reduced to approximately 50% in all analyzed transgenic plants . this finding is in agreement with the heterozygous rnai genotype of the transgenic t <dig> siblings. accordingly, non-transgenic individuals of the segregating t <dig> lines showed normal zmpti1a expression .

in order to further score transgene transmission, t <dig> plants were selfed and their progeny  was analyzed for ppt-resistence. t <dig> plants showed apparent 1: <dig> segregation  which differed clearly from the expected 3: <dig> mendelian segregation and further supported an impaired competitive ability of transgenic rnai pollen. hence, reciprocal crosses between transgenic and wild type plants were repeated with  <dig> different heterozygous transgenic t <dig> plants. segregation analysis of  <dig> t <dig> siblings showed only 33% transgene transmission for the cross wt × t <dig> but 52% for the cross t <dig> × wt. this result confirmed a male specific reduction of transgene transmission .

to check for the existence of homozygous rnai lines, t <dig> plants were screened by northern analysis using pollen rna. several individuals could be identified in which zmpti1a expression was reduced to undetectable levels . after selfing these plants, the corresponding t <dig> progeny did not segregate and zmpti1a protein was decreased to undetectable levels in pollen , indicating the successful establishment of homozygous rnai lines with a silenced zmpti1a gene. homozygous rnai plants did not show any visible mutant phenotype. since homozygous rnai lines could be generated and propagated, knock down of zmpti1a did not result in male sterility. accordingly, rnai pollen was able to germinate and did not show reduced pollen tube growth rates in vitro . because zmpti1a was found to be associated with callose deposition, pollen from heterozygous and homozygous t <dig> rnai plants was stained for -β-glucan. microscopic examination did not reveal significantly altered callose patterns. relative -β-glucan amounts were assayed in pollen of ca.  <dig> t <dig> to t <dig> plants and of wild type lines a <dig> and h <dig> modified according to köhle et al.  <cit> . however, the analysis did not result in statistically significant differences between wild type and homo- or heterozygotic rnai pollen, mainly due to a generally high variation in callose content. taken together, knock down of zmpti1a expression did not result in a visible pollen defect. however, crossing studies indicated that zmpti1a expression provides a significant competitive advantage to the male gametophyte and demonstrated zmpti1a to be an important component for maize reproduction.

discussion
zmpti1a, -b, -c and -d are the first zmpti1-like kinases in a monocotyledonous species to be characterized at the molecular level. although zmpti <dig> kinases from maize do not display high similarity at the nucleotide sequence level, the translated protein sequences are well conserved and the kinase domains maintain all functionally important residues. accordingly, zmpti1a was proven to encode a functional kinase capable of autophosphorylation and to be an in vitro target of kinase activities present in pollen and silk tissue. the presence of several pti1-like kinases in maize is consistent with the observations of pti1-genes belonging to a gene family in tomato  <cit>  and three pti1-related genes identified in glycine max  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis revealed a wide diversity of pti <dig> homologues in the plant kingdom, appearing to segregate into three sub-families mainly based on different n-terminal sequences of the kinases. these sequence regions were not only specific to the maize pti1-kinases but were also highly conserved in putative pti <dig> kinases of other monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. this gives rise to the conclusion that conserved n-termini in different pti <dig> sub-families are evolutionary conserved indicating the functional relevance of this protein domain for proper biological function. accordingly, studies with gfp fusions suggest that the variable n-termini are critical for different targeting properties of the four maize pti <dig> kinases.

zmpti1a contains an n-terminal putative myristoylation motif essential for plasma membrane targeting. n-myristoylation is known to confer reversible membrane association by enhancement of hydrophobic membrane-protein interactions. such membrane associations are known to be further stabilized by reversible s-palmitoylation of cys residues on positions  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . n-terminal gly <dig> and s-palmitoylation at cys <dig> and cys <dig> of oscpk <dig> has been shown to occur in vivo in maize leaf protoplasts with both acylations contributing to full membrane association  <cit> . zmpti1a contains cys residues in position  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  hence, it is likely that these motifs are subjects of fatty acylation and are necessary for proper plasma membrane targeting. indeed, site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding residues partially abolished plasma membrane targeting of zmpti1a:gfp.

interestingly, dual s-acylation was shown to influence protein compartmentalization to specialized plasmalemmal microdomains  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that microdomain association is also responsible for the unequal distribution of zmpti1a in the pollen plasma membrane.

n-terminal myristoylation is not only required for membrane targeting but could also participate in intra- or intermolecular interactions with proteins  <cit> . for instance, intermolecular myristate-protein interactions were shown to facilitate interaction between calmodulin and several proteins  <cit> . therefore, zmpti1a plasma membrane targeting could also be achieved indirectly by interacting proteins. evidence for zmpti1a interacting proteins is provided by the magnetocapture interaction assays which suggested the existence of zmpti1a phosphorylating kinases that bind and phosphorylate zmpti1a in vitro.

mutation of single amino acids which are putatively relevant for myristoylation or acylation results in partial nuclear location of zmpti1a. partial nuclear targeting was also observed for zmpti1b and slpti <dig>  in both proteins gly <dig> is naturally substituted by ser <dig>  chehab et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the n-terminally myristoylated calcium-dependent protein kinase  mccpk <dig> from mesembrynathemum chrystallinum undergoes a reversible change in subcellular localization from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and actin microfilaments in response to reduction in humidity. proteins of the cdpk family also contain variable n-termini and exhibit diverse subcellular localization patterns which reflect their participation in a variety of signaling pathways including hr  <cit> . reversible translocation and activity-dependent localization was also shown for other myristoylated proteins e.g. for the calcium-myristoyl switch proteins vilip <dig> and vilip <dig> in neurons and the flagellar calcium-binding protein fcabp in trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> . thus, it will be of profound interest to investigate if zmpti1a can respond to specific signals by changing its subcellular localization and if putative downstream targets of zmpti1a signaling reside inside the vegetative nucleus of pollen.

zmpti1c and zmpti1d did not contain myristoylation signals but conserved n-terminal pairs of arginine residues. gfp fusions of these sub-group iii pti <dig> proteins showed neither membrane nor nuclear targeting. this is in agreement with studies showing that arginine residues favor cytoplasmic displacement and reduce protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

zmpti1a co-localizes with plasma membrane regions responsible for callose deposition during pollen development and tube growth. callose is a -β-glucan with some  <dig>  branches which not only is the major component of the pollen grain and pollen-tube wall but also plays a key role in pollen viability. callose is deposited in the inner wall layer behind the growing pollen tube tip as well as in regularly formed plugs inside the pollen-tube. callose is not specific to the male gametophyte but widely distributed among various cells and tissues. in sporophytic tissue, synthesis of callose is evidently achieved via a plasma membrane bound multi-subunit enzyme that is usually activated temporally by specific signals such as wounding, infection or other stress. twelve callose synthase  isoenzymes have been identified in arabidopis and each may be tissue-specific and/or regulated under different physiological conditions  <cit> . putative regulatory subunits of the cals complex are rop <dig> gtpase, ugt <dig>  annexin-like proteins  and sucrose synthase  <cit> . however, subunit composition and regulation of cals complexes is far from being understood. remarkably, arthur et al.  <cit>  showed that rop <dig>  one of  <dig> known rop gtpases from maize, also provides a competitive advantage to the male gametophyte. heterozygous rop2::mu mutants show a reduced transgene transmission by pollen similarly to what was observed with zmpti1a rnai plants. although there is no experimental evidence yet, a biological link between rop gtpases, cals complexes and zmpti1a may be speculated for pollen.

in accordance with the presence of multiple cals complexes in plants, callose deposition is not only known to be involved in pollen development, pollen-tube growth and self-incompatibility but also in cytokinesis and pathogen defence. for instance, hypersensitive cell death induced in plants thwarts further advance of the pathogen is seen to correlate with callose deposition at and around the site of hr. this strengthens the cell wall to attenuate pathogen invasion  <cit> . in tomato, slpto and slpti <dig> were shown to be involved in gene-for-gene resistance against pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strains. based on protein similarity and subcellular localization zmpti1b was identified as a likely functional ortholog of slpti <dig> in maize. a putative function of zmpti1b in pathogene defense was supported by the observed induction of zmpti1b transcript in fusarium spec. infected kernels.

the diversity of callose function exemplified increasing evidence that plant responses such as male fertility, self-incompatibility, pathogenesis, symbiosis and wounding are based on highly related molecules and have evolutionary conserved signalling mechanisms  <cit> . our analyses of pti <dig> kinases from maize support this model and suggested pti kinases as conserved components of these different but related signal cascades in plants. current studies are aimed at further elucidating the function of zmpti <dig> genes in maize and in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we cloned and characterized four novel pti <dig> kinases from maize. expression patterns and subcellular targeting of the proteins were investigated. zmpti1a encodes a functional serine/threonine kinase specific to pollen and is associated with plasma membrane regions responsible for callose deposition. zmpti1a expression provides a competitive advantage to pollen. thus its activity seems to be important for the proper biological function of pollen. in contrast, zmpti1b is likely to be involved in maize pathogen responses. considering the fact that pollen-sporophyte interaction and pathogen induced hr show certain similarities e.g. callose deposition and ca2+ influx, members of the pti <dig> kinase family are hypothesized to act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes during different developmental programs and in different tissue types.
