BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is a serious human disease caused by the airborne bacillus mycobacterium tuberculosis. responsible for over  <dig>  million deaths and  <dig> million new cases of tb worldwide in  <dig>  <cit> , m. tuberculosis is arguably the most successful bacterial human pathogen ever. over  <dig> billion individuals are estimated to be latently infected with m. tuberculosis  <cit> , representing a huge reservoir for the emergence and spread of active tb that occurs in approximately 5–10 % of latently infected cases. the exact mechanisms and properties of latent tb infection  are not fully elucidated. ltbi is represented by heterogeneous paucibacillary populations of m. tuberculosis with varying metabolic activities and replication rates, residing in tissues mostly without histological evidence of tb infection, and not necessarily restricted to pulmonary sites  <cit> . in essence, the pathogen can enter a dormant or latent state characterized by limited growth and metabolism, resulting in the absence of clinical symptoms in the host, and most importantly by increased phenotypic tolerance to the main drugs, thereby allowing indefinite persistence in the human body. this persistence is the main reason why the current treatment for new cases of pulmonary tb is very long, consisting of a six month therapy with four antibiotics . in drug-resistant tb, the treatment duration is even longer and requires more expensive second-line drugs that are poorly tolerated and less effective than the front-line drugs.

to fight tb more efficiently, it is essential to shorten the treatment duration with new, more potent drugs that, ideally, are also active against ltbi. to facilitate the discovery of such drugs, in vitro models for ltbi can be used to screen chemical libraries. current in vitro models such as nutrient starvation  <cit> , nutrient depletion  <cit> , progressive hypoxia  <cit> , nitric oxide treatment  <cit>  and multiple stresses  <cit>  mimic the dormant state of m. tuberculosis and are valuable for research purposes, but are impractical for high throughput applications.

the streptomycin -dependent m. tuberculosis strain 18b provides the basis of a simple and robust model that mimicks non-replicating bacteria. the strain was initially isolated as a str-resistant mutant in japan in  <dig>  <cit>  and then found to be str-dependent. strain 18b enters a viable but non-replicating state in the absence of str and has been extensively validated as a simple drug discovery tool in our laboratory both in vitro and in vivo . in addition, strain 18b has proved useful for vaccine studies and to investigate the basis of immunopathology in animal models . despite its success in biomedical research, little is known about 18b nor how well str-starved 18b  mimics ltbi compared to other dormancy models. in this work we determined and analysed the complete genome sequence of 18b and report the transcriptomic response to str depletion.

RESULTS
whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly
the genome sequence was obtained by merging datasets generated using four different high-throughput sequencing platforms. details of the coverage and the number of contigs obtained using each technology may be found in table  <dig>  the de novo assembly of the  <dig> dataset using newbler v <dig>   <cit>  produced a  <dig>  mb-long scaffold and two short scaffolds . the  <dig> contigs obtained from the de novo assembly of the  <dig>  illumina and iontorrent reads with mira v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , were manually aligned onto the newbler scaffolds in order to close gaps, since mira resolves repetitive areas more effectively. after this  <dig> gaps remained, all but one of which were closed using pacbio technology and hgap <dig> software  <cit> . the remaining ~7 kb-long gap corresponds to the genes rv <dig> , rv3513c  and most of rv <dig> . this area has the highest gc content in the h37rv genome  and consists almost entirely of low-complexity and repetitive sequences. read coverage and quality dropped dramatically for this genomic area for all sequencing technologies used, thus preventing accurate consensus calling, although from the available reads we could conclude that this area in 18b is similar to that in other m. tuberculosis strains.table  <dig> sequencing and assembly of m. tuberculosis 18b genome

the final assembly was obtained from the consensus of the three assemblies described above, resulting in a single contig containing  <dig>  mb. a total of  <dig> protein coding-genes and  <dig> pseudogenes were predicted . the number of ribosomal rna , trna  and other non-coding rna genes  was the same as in the reference strain h37rv.

phylogeny
to gain more insight into the origin of 18b we compared its genome sequence with the previously published snp dataset of 110 m. tuberculosis strains from the beijing lineage  <cit> . we obtained the same tree topology as merker et al.  <cit> , with 18b clustering within the “asian ancestral 3” lineage .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of 110 m. tuberculosis beijing genomes  <cit>  and the genome of 18b, based on  <dig> snp sites



to further assess the relationship of 18b with other m. tuberculosis strains, we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on snps derived from whole genome alignments of 1793 m. tuberculosis strains deposited in genbank. the phylogenetic tree  unambiguously distinguished all previously defined m. tuberculosis lineages  <cit> . the strain that branched closest to 18b was tkk_04_ <dig> , isolated in  <dig> in switzerland. this strain differed by only  <dig> snps compared to 18b .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of m. tuberculosis.

annotation and comparative genomics with strain h37rv
the genome of 18b was annotated using multiple automated genome annotation engines, followed by manual curation . we used orthomcl  <cit>  to infer the orthologs between h37rv and 18b, and discarded singleton short hypothetical predictions  from the 18b annotation, as these generally result from overprediction by automated gene predictors. the remaining ortholog groups as well as genes unique to either h37rv or 18b were manually checked. for the remaining longer predictions we retained only those supported by our rna-seq data or by proteomics  <cit> . finally we retained  <dig> novel gene predictions in 18b that were not present in the current h37rv annotation .

globally collinear with the h37rv genome, the genome of 18b has  <dig> large indels  compared to h37rv . two deletions in the direct repeat  region of 18b  produce the characteristic beijing spoligotype,  <dig>  <cit> . seventeen large indels were attributed to insertions or excisions of insertion sequences , and  <dig> indels affected genes encoding proteins. the largest difference between the genomes of 18b and h37rv is the absence of the phirv <dig> prophage from 18b, a 9245 bp area containing  <dig> genes  in h37rv.

fifty protein-coding genes present in h37rv are missing from 18b , while  <dig> genes present in 18b have no ortholog in h37rv . the majority of the missing genes correspond to phages, insertion sequences  and hypothetical proteins. exceptions are rv1759c  in h37rv, a pe-pgrs family protein that is predicted to be secreted  <cit>  and mt18b_ <dig> in 18b . forty-four protein-coding genes were predicted as pseudogenes in 18b due to frameshifts or disruption by is elements, while their orthologs in h37rv are predicted to be functional . consistent with 18b belonging to the beijing family, mt18b_ <dig>  was found to be frameshifted, as reported earlier by fallow et al.  <cit> .

several genes were predicted to be longer in 18b than their orthologs in h37rv. in most cases, an 18b gene overlapped two shorter open reading frames  from h37rv that are likely to be pseudogenes arising from a frameshift or a premature stop codon , but in some cases the difference was due to indels. for example, a curious case is the kdpe gene in 18b, which has a 35 bp deletion in its 3′-region leading to its fusion with the following orf. based on a blast search against all available m. tuberculosis sequences, the long version of kdpe was found to be exclusive to 18b.

the mt18b_ <dig> gene, coding for isocitrate lyase , is intact in 18b, while it is frameshifted in h37rv. therefore, 18b possesses two functional isocitrate lyase genes , like the erdman strain  <cit> . another hallmark of the beijing lineage is the presence of an intact psk1- <dig> gene required for the production of the phenolic glycolipid pgl  <cit> , in all other m. tuberculosis lineages this is frameshifted giving rise to pks <dig> and pks <dig> as exemplified by h37rv. other examples of “restored” orfs in 18b include ppe5/ppe <dig>  mce2b/rv0590a, mmpl13a/mmpl13b, cela2a/cela2b, pks3/pks <dig>  rv3233c/tgs <dig>  nat/rv3566a, fadd <dig> /fadd <dig> etc. .

another interesting case in m. tuberculosis 18b is that of espk , since the number of its characteristic tandem repeats, encoding gtpitpg motifs, is not only different between 18b and h37rv, but also varies among other m. tuberculosis strains. espk is an esx- <dig> secretion-associated protein, and the esx- <dig> secretion system is the major virulence determinant in m. tuberculosis and m. marinum, but the role of espk in this system is not clear. other genes that are significantly longer  in 18b compared to h37rv include mt18b_3557/rv <dig>  mt18b_4446/ppe <dig>  mt18b_2455/rv1888c, cobb, dxs <dig> and lipv. on the other hand there were  <dig> genes in 18b that were at least 10 % shorter than their orthologs in h37rv,  <dig> of which coded for hypothetical proteins. in some cases, the difference in length was due to mutations, but in several others it was due to different predictions of translation start sites. we retained those start sites that were supported by our rna-seq data. this was the case for  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> had a predicted function: nat, fadd <dig>  biob, ispe, thid, prfb, lipt, mrp, gcvt, ppia, dop and sigg.

results from our comparative analysis point toward two major sources of gene variation among strains: gene prediction discrepancies, which can be considered as a technical problem, and genomic variations. inconsistent gene predictions and annotations among closely related strains are a general problem, which could lead to errors in a naïve comparative approach. accounting for this problem, we have identified several genes with different orf lengths between 18b and h37rv as a consequence of genomic variation. while the possible effect of such mutations could depend on many factors and so cannot be easily assessed in silico, it is plausible that some differences observed here might have a functional impact. evidence of phenotypic diversity of m. tuberculosis strains, including important clinical traits such as virulence and pathogenesis is abundant , although linking specific mutations to an m. tuberculosis phenotype remains challenging especially for quantitative traits.

is elements
except for is <dig> and the phirv <dig> prophage, all the mobile elements identified in the genome of h37rv  <cit>  were also present in the genome of 18b, in the same genomic regions. is <dig> is found exclusively in the m. tuberculosis complex where it is the most active is element. it is therefore used as a diagnostic tool and for genotyping. the h37rv genome contains  <dig> copies of is <dig>  while 18b has  <dig> . only five is <dig> copies were found in the same genomic positions in both strains, but none of these loci was identical: one copy was truncated in 18b, three copies were inverted, and the synteny of the plcd region was altered due to recombination between flanking copies leading to only one copy of is <dig> remaining in 18b. another hallmark of the beijing family is the presence of a copy of is <dig> in the dnaa-dnan locus  <cit> .

streptomycin dependence and unique snps
the peculiar str-dependent phenotype of 18b was initially attributed to a specific mutation in the rrs gene encoding the 16s rrna  <cit> . the insertion of a cytosine  in the  <dig> loop of 16s rrna, a region known to be involved in str susceptibility and resistance, seems to be exclusive to 18b since this mutation was not found in over  <dig>  m. tuberculosis datasets from the short read archive  at ncbi. positions 512– <dig> in the  <dig> loop are in direct interaction with the ribosomal protein s <dig>  based on the structure of streptomycin bound to the 30s ribosomal subunit of thermus thermophilus  <cit> , we deduced that insertion of a cytosine at this position will affect the  <dig> loop conformation and could modify the binding of s <dig> and str to the ribosome .fig.  <dig> structural model of the 30s subunit of the ribosome. a stereoscopic view of the str-binding site in the t. thermophilus 30s ribosomal subunit. str, represented in orange, is in direct interaction with helix  <dig>  and helix  <dig>  both in dark grey, and the s <dig> protein in blue. in m. tuberculosis 18b, the cytosine inserted between g <dig> and c <dig> is shown in red. b model of interaction between if <dig> and the 30s ribosomal subunit. if3n, represented in green with the insertion of glu <dig> , is in interaction with ribosomal protein s <dig> 



curiously though, all our attempts to introduce this mutation into the h37rv genome have failed, suggesting the presence of additional or compensatory mutations in 18b. likewise, no streptomycin-susceptible revertants have ever been isolated, which is consistent with the hypothesis that str-dependence may involve more than one mutation. since str inhibits translation we first examined all translation-related genes for the presence of snp but only one was found in fusa <dig>  this resulted in a missense mutation to elongation factor g  but this snp is present in all strains from the beijing family  <cit> .

assuming that such a second site mutation might be exclusive to 18b, we then extracted the  <dig> snps restricted to 18b from the comparison with 1793 m. tuberculosis genomes  and blasted each of the 20 bp regions encompassing them against  <dig>  m. tuberculosis datasets from sra. with the exception of one dataset ,  <dig> out of  <dig> snps were very rare in m. tuberculosis datasets , and for the remaining two snps, both in mt18b_ <dig> , g2367949c and c2367951g, not a single read was found in any of the m. tuberculosis datasets. however, inspection of the genes associated with all  <dig> snps revealed no obvious link to streptomycin resistance.

next, all genes harbouring small indels were examined leading to the finding that infc, encoding initiation factor  <dig> , had a single glu codon inserted after codon  <dig>  this insertion was not found in any of 1793 m. tuberculosis genome sequences available, nor in the  <dig>  m. tuberculosis datasets from sra, and affects a region of the protein that is well conserved among bacteria. if <dig> is an essential protein that interacts with the 30s subunit of the ribosome, to which str also binds. the inserted glu residue in if <dig> from strain 18b is located in the n-terminal domain, after turn one and at the start of beta-strand two in the 3d-structure of if <dig> from geobacillus stearothermophilus  <cit> . to date if <dig> from mycobacteria has not been associated with str-susceptibility or resistance. to go further, we modelled the interaction between the crystal structure of the 30s ribosomal subunit of t. thermophilus  <cit>  and the n-terminal domain of if <dig>  by using the approximate orientation of if3n derived from hydroxyl-radical cleavage data  <cit>  . if <dig> is localized near the e-site, far from the  <dig> loop, and does not seem to interact directly with streptomycin. however, if3n is in contact with ribosomal protein s <dig>  which has been implicated in conditional str-dependence and makes translation hyper-accurate  <cit> . the inserted glu <dig> seems to contact s <dig> and could thus affect its function leading to a str dependent phenotype.

in prokaryotes, formation of the translation initiation complex requires binding of several components to the 30s ribosomal subunit namely, the mrna, all three initiation factors and the f-met initiator trna. str typically binds to the 16s rrna between the  <dig> loop , helix  <dig>  helix  <dig> and the ribosomal protein s <dig> and makes ribosomes error prone by affecting the proof-reading step. if <dig>  which has distinct n- and c-terminal domains, impacts binding of the other ligands and appears to play at least two roles  <cit> . if3c prevents the association of the 30s and 50s ribosomal subunits whereas if3n is implicated in verifying codon-anticodon complementarity  <cit>  and docking studies have placed if3n close to s <dig> and the peptidyl-trna binding site of the ribosome of t. thermophilus  <cit> . the structure of the m. tuberculosis ribosome is not yet available but should be similar to that of other prokaryotes . our finding of insertional mutations in both the decoding centre, the  <dig> loop, and in if3n strongly suggests that these are compensatory changes required to allow translation to proceed in the presence of str in strain 18b. the relationship between the two mutations is not direct but could have a strong impact on two important ribosomal proteins, s <dig> and s <dig> 

transcriptional response of ss18b
in order to gain better knowledge of the biology of m. tuberculosis 18b and to characterize the transcriptional response to str withdrawal we used rna-seq to analyse gene expression in the exponential phase of growth with str, and upon its removal, when m. tuberculosis 18b no longer grows and enters the non-replicating state . two time-points were chosen: 2 weeks after removal of str, the standard time-point for evaluating drug activity , and 4 weeks. in addition, the antibiotic was added to the bacterial culture after 4 weeks without str, leading to growth resumption, and rna was then analysed. sequencing reads were mapped to the m. tuberculosis 18b genome sequence. overall, we used 2– <dig> biological replicates per condition. additional file 10: dataset s <dig> presents the results obtained. in the following paragraphs we will describe the main findings and compare the transcriptional response of ss18b to that of other models of non-replicating persistence .

differential gene expression analysis was performed between the exponential growth phase and the non-replicating condition . we detected  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes 2 weeks after str withdrawal ) and  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes at 4 weeks . as previously shown  <cit> , addition of str to ss18b cultures after 4 weeks resulted in regrowth and almost completely restored the gene expression levels to those seen in exponential phase. indeed, only  <dig> genes were found to be more expressed compared to the initial exponential phase . in general, the transcriptional response in ss18b after 4 weeks recapitulated that observed at week  <dig>  although more pronounced differences were noted compared to the exponential growth phase .

the two most up-regulated genes in ss18b,  encode proteins of unknown function. rv <dig> was induced in macrophage infection experiments  <cit>  but down-regulated during nutrient starvation  <cit>  and not affected during low oxygen conditions  <cit> . on the other hand, transcription of rv <dig> increased in different dormancy models , but not in response to drugs  <cit> .

among the top up-regulated genes after 2 weeks of str depletion were sige, sigb, sigl, dipz and rv <dig>  the sigma factor gene sigb is known to be up-regulated in stationary phase, under microaerophilic conditions  <cit> , nutrient starvation  <cit>  and macrophage infection  <cit> . genes belonging to the cydabdc operon, encoding cytochrome bd-type menaquinol oxidase, are among the most highly expressed genes in ss18b  and are also up-regulated during phosphate depletion  <cit>  and microaerophilic condition  <cit> . biogenesis of this oxidase requires dipz.

most heat-shock protein genes were induced in ss18b, notably hspx , htpx , dnak , dnaj <dig> , and hsp  whereas the most down-regulated genes were part of two operons: rv0167-rv <dig>  and nuoa-n . the latter, encoding the nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase  involved in aerobic respiration, was repressed on nutrient starvation  <cit> , upon phosphate depletion  <cit> , during growth in macrophages and under low oxygen conditions  <cit> . the exact function of the mce <dig> operon is unknown, although it seems to be essential for survival in macrophages  <cit> , and is down-regulated under low oxygen conditions and in m. tuberculosis inside macrophages  <cit> . the second most repressed genes in ss18b were reca and recx . a himar1-insertion mutant of reca is known to produce slow growing colonies  <cit>  and the recax operon to be silenced upon phosphate depletion  <cit>  or hypoxia  <cit> .

transcription of the molybdopterin biosynthesis locus, moa <dig>  was down-regulated in ss18b , while the moa <dig> locus was not significantly affected. the moa <dig> cluster was down-regulated in low oxygen conditions  <cit> , but increased transcription was reported during phosphate depletion  <cit>  and in murine macrophages  <cit> . the trp operon  is down-regulated in ss18b and was also reported as being repressed under different low oxygen conditions  <cit> .

some non-coding rnas  were described as differentially expressed during stationary phase in previous studies. notably, mcr <dig> and mts <dig> were up-regulated in stationary phase  <cit> . in our study, mcr <dig>  was up-regulated 8-fold while mts <dig>  the most abundant ncrna in m. tuberculosis h37rv, was up-regulated 4-fold. other ncrna genes were significantly induced after str removal : mcr <dig> , ncrmt <dig> , mpr <dig> , mcr <dig> , and as <dig> . on the contrary, ncrmt <dig>  and mts <dig>  were repressed when bacteria did not grow and an antisense rna from the ino <dig> gene was not found under any growth conditions, unlike in strain h37rv  <cit> .

after 4 weeks of str depletion more genes were deregulated, including most of those found to be differentially expressed at week two but with some exceptions . the most notable were rv <dig>  glbn, ahpc, higa and higb, which were >7-fold up-regulated after 2 weeks of str depletion but virtually restored to the control levels after 4 weeks. such marked differences were not observed for the down-regulated genes.

some genes were even more significantly differentially expressed after 4 weeks of str depletion. for example, rv <dig> , erm, dut, mts <dig> and rv <dig> , rv <dig> .

comparison with other models of nrp
we compared our data genome-wide with those obtained with other models of nrp: the nutrient starvation model  <cit> , the oxygen depletion condition  <cit> , and various stresses mimicking the non-replicating or persistent state . the comparisons are summarized as weighted venn diagrams in additional file 11: figure s <dig>  despite differences in the experimental conditions and statistical methods used, we observed a certain degree of overlap and consistency between the various models, especially for the direction of gene regulation . for example, most of the genes defined as “dormancy regulon” by voskuil et al.  <cit>  or additional “stationary-phase-induced” genes  <cit>  are also up-regulated in ss18b, albeit most of them having an fdr over 5 %. better overlap with the ss18b response was observed for the results from microaerophilic rather than prolonged anaerobic conditions  <cit> , consistent with growth of 18b in the presence of air. interestingly, the transcriptional response of m. tuberculosis growing in macrophages was in great part consistent with that of str depletion in 18b. importantly, while the other studies employed microarrays, ours represents the first to use rna-seq, thus providing higher resolution and detection of otherwise missed small transcripts.

some genes are consistently regulated in various dormancy models  <cit> . to see if a similar pattern would emerge using our data we performed a hierarchical gene clustering analysis of the ss18b differentially expressed genes  with those of other nrp models . the strongest clustering occurred for the “dormancy regulon” genes  <cit> . the datasets from microaerophilic nrp conditions clustered together as expected. expression signatures from the multiple stress method  <cit>  clustered together with those of phosphate  <cit>  and nutrient depletion  <cit> , which can be attributed to the fact that nutrient starvation had the strongest effect in that multi-stress study  <cit> . interestingly, the results from one hypoxia study  <cit>  clustered closest to ss18b, but those of other hypoxia models were scattered . additional datasets can be found in additional file 12: figure s2b, additional file 13: figure s3b and additional file 14: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in ss18b and the results from previous works. up-regulated genes are in red, down-regulated in blue. red and yellow arrow heads denote “dormancy regulon” genes as defined in  <cit>  and  <cit>  respectively. only genes that were at least two-fold differentially expressed  in 18b were considered



m. tuberculosis 18b-specific features
comparing our results with those derived from other conditions enabled us to identify genes that are uniquely expressed in the ss18b model. for example, rv <dig>  roca, pepe, rv <dig>  pe_pgrs <dig>  rv <dig> and rv <dig> were at least 4-fold up-regulated, but either unaffected or down-regulated in other dormancy models. rv <dig> was described as upregulated in a ∆dosr mutant  <cit>  and in mdr strains  <cit> . on the other hand, rv <dig> was induced by stationary phase  <cit>  but not in non-replicating persistence models. similarly, rv2719c, rv3201c, rv <dig>  and rv <dig> were at least 4-fold down-regulated in ss18b, but either unaffected or up-regulated in other studies. both rv2719c and rv3201c were found to be induced by dna damage  <cit> , whereas rv <dig> encodes for an essential putative antigen. finally, rv <dig> is located upstream of the moa operon, which is repressed in ss18b.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome analysis presented in this study shows strain 18b to belong to the beijing family of m. tuberculosis and, in particular, to clade three of the ancient ancestral lineage. in addition to the genetic markers characteristic of the beijing family, such as an intact psk1- <dig> gene and polymorphisms in the fusa <dig> and dost genes, strain 18b has an unusual frameshift mutation in its kdpe gene encoding the transcriptional regulatory protein kdpe. loss or altered function of this part of the two-component system, kdpde, may result in an altered response to potassium limitation due to aberrant regulation of the linked kdpfabc operon encoding a potassium transport system. the dna binding domain of kdpe is situated at the c-terminal end of the protein; however, in 18b, this domain is followed by an additional  <dig> amino acid residues. functional investigation into potassium uptake is ongoing.

a major finding of this investigation was the discovery of a second mutation that may contribute to the unique str-dependence. in addition to the insertion of a cytosine in the  <dig> loop region of the 16s rrna  <cit> , we report a mutation in infc, coding for initiation factor if <dig>  our modelling studies provided a potential explanation to the role played by this mutation in str-dependence. experimental support is now required for this interpretation, which provides new insight into ribosome function.

from the comparative transcriptomic study of ss18b and other nrp models of m. tuberculosis we were able to draw the following conclusions. first, upon str-removal gene expression is altered thereby allowing cell metabolism to adapt to the non-replicating state. this is reflected in a shift from aerobic growth as evidenced by high nadh-oxidase levels to microaerophilic conditions with induction of cytochrome bd-type menaquinol oxidase and the components of the dormancy regulon. overall, although there are some particularities, the gene expression profiles in ss18b are reasonably consistent with those observed in other nrp models and with the transcriptional profile of m. tuberculosis growing intra-cellularly. this once again underlines the utility of strain 18b as a model for understanding nrp on the one hand and for finding drugs active against ltbi on the other.
