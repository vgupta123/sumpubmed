BACKGROUND
tetrahymena thermophila is one of the most extensively examined ciliated protozoa and for decades it has served as a model organism in different research areas. the discovery of telomeres  <cit>  and telomerase  <cit>  as well as rna-mediated catalysis  <cit>  were discovered and studied in tetrahymena. within the last decades molecular biological techniques have been developed to alter t. thermophila's genome and proteome: there are dna transfection methods that allow transformation of either the germline micronucleus  or the vegetative macronucleus   <cit> . episomal plasmids based on an rdna-replicon are available  <cit> . homologous recombination in either mic or mac enable knock-out/-in techniques  <cit> . on protein level heterologous expression of related species has been performed  <cit>  and recently the expression of functional human enzymes including proper formation of disulfide bridges and addition of n-glycans has been demonstrated . in parallel a few research groups have evaluated the biotechnological potential of tetrahymena within the last years  <cit> . promising results have been achieved to culture this species with fast growth to high biomasses. furthermore fermentation processes can be performed in ordinary bacterial/yeast equipment. additionally up-scalability, one of the most important criteria for industrial production, has been demonstrated successfully. there are also data on tetrahymena continuous high-cell-density fermentation in a perfused bioreactor making this organism even more useful for industrial applications  <cit> . for all these reasons tetrahymena thermophila has been selected by the us national human genome research institute as one of the high-priority genomes for sequencing in  <dig>  today sequencing of the mac genome has nearly been completed by the institute for genomic research thus enabling mining of the organism's genome. tiny amounts of protein, e.g., can be characterized easily by mass spectrometry in connection with a search for obtained peptide fragments within the database. t. thermophila secretes many lysosomal enzymes into the surrounding medium  <cit> : phospholipases  <cit> , glycosidases  <cit> , phosphatases  <cit>  and proteases  <cit>  that will modify or even degrade potential product. in a heterologous expression system these undesired enzyme activities must be depressed to assure quality and yield of the product. today all microbial expression systems can rely on decades of research results including detailed information on the genome and proteome of the used organisms. so, e.g., in e. coli systems optimised strains with additional trnas and/or protease deficiencies have been engineered and have been available on the market for many years. yet tetrahymena's commercial potential has not been exploited at all although today all necessary tools for genetic engineering are available. till now only one protease-sequence for tetrahymena has been identified by experimental means: tetrain in t.pyriformis, a cathepsin l family member  <cit> . in t.thermophila a cdna encoding for a similar putative protease, pcyp, has been described, but examination of the protein and its expression are lacking  <cit> . although straus et al. described the purification of different t.thermophila cysteine proteases by conventional chromatography methods they were not able to determine the sequence of the enzymes  <cit> . as all proteases described so far are cysteine proteases and nearly all proteolytic activity of cell extracts can be inhibited by cysteine protease specific inhibitors we chose a straightforward one-step purification approach described by greenbaum et al. this method makes use of modified trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido--butane  and has been adopted successfully for cysteine proteases of different organisms ranging from plants  <cit>  over p. falciparum  <cit>  to d.melanogaster  <cit> . here we provide an additional step in the development of a high performance expression system based on tetrahymena by an in-detail molecular characterization of the major extracellular proteases.

RESULTS
synthesis of dcg-04
protease activity profiling is based on labelled protease inhibitors that covalently bind to proteases in an activity dependent manner. these specifically binding reagents can also be used for purification purposes. by linking the cysteine protease inhibitor e <dig> to biotin greenbaum et al. created a versatile tool called dcg-04for rapid purification of cysteine proteases by immobilizing the substrate/protease complex to streptavidin beads. the method is summarized in figure  <dig>  synthesis of the substance was performed according to the methods section. the formation of the proper product was verified by mass spectrometry .

secretion kinetics, production and ex ante characterization of t. thermophila extracellular proteases
for production of extracellular proteases in growing t. thermophila the secretion kinetics of the enzymes during cultivation in shaker flasks was monitored . maximum protease activity is observed in late logarithmic growing cell cultures. consequently to achieve large amount of material, cells were separated from the media of a 2l fermentation process after  <dig> hours yielding  <dig> u/ml of protease activity .

to evaluate the optimal ph at which the purification would work best the protease activity in the harvested supernatant was determined at different ph values. the results shown in figure  <dig> suggest optimal conditions at neutral to slight basic ph.

to demonstrate that most of the proteolytic activity is due to cysteine and not serine or threonine proteases the inhibitory effect of dcg- <dig> on the concentrated supernatant was investigated. the strongly alkylating agent lithium iodoacetate served as positive control for enzyme inhibition. nearly all proteolytic activity vanished by addition of dcg- <dig> ; remaining activity is as low as background activity. these findings argue that most of the predominant, secreted proteases are members of the cysteine protease family.

purification and identification of t. thermophila secreted proteases
according to the ph activity profile of secreted proteases of tetrahymena the capturing step with dcg- <dig> was performed at ph  <dig> . figure  <dig> illustrates the results of the one-step purification process: the crude supernatants before and after incubation with dcg- <dig> and streptavidin labelled beads  show a vast and complex band pattern of different sized proteins. the purified protein fraction eluted from the matrix results in predominant bands running at molecular weights ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kd. these sizes have been described for many mature cysteine proteases. to verify the specificity of the purification process, aliquots of the samples were separated by 2-d gel electrophoresis, then blotted to nitrocellulose and finally probed with an anti-biotin antibody. all spots visible on a silver stained reference gel were readily detected by the antibody . this argues for an efficient and covalent binding of dcg- <dig> to the proteases. the bands between  <dig> and  <dig> kd were excised and subjected to mass spectrometry. the search algorithm exploited a preliminary database provided by tigr, a very useful and valuable tool the importance of which has already been predicted in  <dig>   <cit>  six different cysteine proteases of the cathepsin family were unambiguously identified by at least two independent peptides  termed ttcysp1- <dig> . these proteins are listed in the preliminary gene release at the institute for genomic research under temporary identifier  <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig>   <dig> m <dig> and  <dig> m <dig> respectively and are located on genomic contig sb <dig>  <dig>  sb <dig>  <dig>  sb <dig>  <dig>  sb <dig>  <dig>  sb <dig>  <dig> and sb <dig>  <dig>  whereas the protease pcyp described by karrer et al.  <cit>  was not detectable, sequence alignments reveal that ttcysp <dig> is t. thermophila tetrain  <cit>  is  <dig> % identical to the t.pyriformis protein. all identified enzymes show a prepro-peptide structure indicated by an erfnin motif  <cit>  . signal peptides were predicted by computational analysis . all amino acids essential for enzyme activity are highly conserved . as expected no fragments within the first  <dig> amino acids were found because the prepro-peptide  is cleaved off during the processing of the enzyme. peptides containing the catalytic cysteine at position ~ <dig> are masked by covalently bound dcg- <dig> 

discussion
it is known that the majority of intra- and extracellular proteases in tetrahymena are cysteine proteases. straus et al. reported, that at least four different proteases are present in t.thermophila supernatants. but they were not able to derive any sequences from their data  <cit> . the only sequence information available on an active protease in growing tetrahymena cells is tetrain, a t. pyriformis derived enzyme. the results presented in this work confirm all data available so far: chemical targeting of cysteine proteases by means of a mechanism based probe combined with mass spectrometry has allowed identification of six extracellular t. thermophila cysteine proteases and their sequences have been determined; the existence of a t. thermophila tetrain has been confirmed by sequence comparison. pcyp, a protease described by karrer  <cit> , could not be detected in our experiments. a possible explanation is that the cdna isolates used for detection of pcyp were derived from starved, not from growing cells. this would imply that tetrahymena is able to up- and down regulate different proteases on changing environmental, physiological conditions, a phenomenon that suzuki et al. already postulated for the t. pyriformis tetrain protease  <cit> . the regulation of various proteins in tetrahymena during different development stages has been reported and investigated in detail by comparing growing, starving and conjugating cells: it was shown that for many differentially expressed proteins the transcriptional activity is the major regulating mechanism <cit>  this could also be true for pcyp being down-regulated during vegetative growth. taking a look at the recently acquired genome database of t.thermophila one will find far more than  <dig> different putative genes encoding for cysteine proteases. table  <dig> lists the  <dig> cysteine proteases that are most similar to ttcysp <dig>  all of them have a functional signal peptide according to signalp analysis and the conserved amino acids of the erfnin motif are also present in nearly any putative enzyme. these findings argue that t.thermophila is able to choose in a regulated way from a whole set of different proteolytic enzymes, that must be secreted. further experiments to verify this hypothesis need to be done.

CONCLUSIONS
the main aim in this study was to identify most active proteases in growing ciliate cells as this is the phase ideally suited for expression of foreign genes. well established e. coli and yeast based expression systems have been making use of protease deficient strains for decades to enlarge their product yields. the information provided by the above results therefore is urgently needed for genetic engineering in strain optimisation. to develop a competitive, alternative expression platform based on t. thermophila the identified proteases must selectively be knocked out.
