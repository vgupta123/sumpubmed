BACKGROUND
most genes in the mammalian genome are expressed from both parental alleles. imprinted genes represent a minority of genes, which are transcribed from only one allele. while the molecular mechanisms underlying imprinting control have some commonalities, their individual expression control and expression patterns appear to vary in a developmental and tissue specific manner. a systematic investigation of their expression profiles may help to better understand the biological function and regulation of imprinted genes.

to date, approximately  <dig> genes with evidence for imprinting effects in either human or mouse are described  <cit> . based on recent predictions, the number of mammalian imprinted genes may range between  <dig> and  <dig> genes  <cit> , i.e. a substantial number of imprinted genes are already identified.

the imprinted expression of genes appears to be a rather conserved phenomenon in mammals  <cit> ; i.e., genes that are found to be imprinted in one species are most likely imprinted in the other. this tenet, however, is not always fixed, as has been shown for the two orthologous man and mouse genes l3mbtl and l3mbtl. these genes each encode a polycomb protein. in human, the gene is frequently absent in patients with myeloid malignancies. human l3mbtl has been shown to be paternally expressed due to monoallelic methylation  <cit>  whereas mouse l3mbtl is not imprinted nor are its cpg islands differentially methylated  <cit> .

orthologous genes that are imprinted in human and mouse are most likely either maternally or paternally expressed in both organisms. rarely, genes are oppositely imprinted such as the zim2/zim <dig> genes: human zim <dig> is paternally expressed while mouse zim <dig> is maternally expressed  <cit> . this phenomenon might be explained by the fact that the human zim <dig> gene shares 5' exons and a promoter with the likewise paternally expressed peg <dig> gene, while mouse zim <dig> appears not to do so  <cit> .

imprinted genes have been hypothesized to play a major role in the regulation of embryonic growth  <cit> , to control placental function and to modulate the transport of nutrients from mother to embryo  <cit> . indeed, a number of imprinted genes, such as ascl <dig>  phlda <dig>  peg <dig>  are indispensable for proper placental morphology and function while others are involved in nutrient supply regulation  <cit> . additionally, there is strong evidence that imprinted genes control neurological development and function as well as energy homeostasis in postnatal stages of development and the adult  <cit> .

based on these various observations it seems likely that imprinted genes are tightly regulated in a developmental and tissue specific manner. while tissue specific expression profiles have been examined for some selected genes, no study on the entire class of imprinted genes has been performed so far. furthermore little is known about the expression status in adult tissues compared to embryonic states.

in this study we performed a computational expression analysis of human and mouse imprinted genes in a variety of non-cancerous tissues using a set of existing systematic transcriptional profiling data  <cit> . in particular, we  compared the profiles of individual genes across tissues,  analysed the correlations of expression patterns in human and mouse, and  explored the role of predicted transcription factor binding sites in correlation to tissue specific expression. our data provide new insights into the range and extend of expression, the tissue specific function and the regulation of imprinted genes in two mammalian species.

RESULTS
sets of imprinted genes selected for analysis
the imprinted gene catalogue   <cit>  reports imprinted genes in various species, including human and mouse. we gathered information from the igc on  <dig> genes for which solid experimental data on allele-specific expression was available  . among these  <dig> genes, only  <dig> had been analysed in human as well as in mouse revealing that  <dig> of these are imprinted in both species. for one of these genes the status was only confirmed in human, for  <dig> genes only in mouse. thus, of the genes analysed in both species 87% showed conservation of imprinting. for the additional  <dig> imprinted genes the imprinting status had only been analysed in mouse, and for additional  <dig> genes only in human.

tissue-specific expression patterns of imprinted genes
using a publicly available gene expression dataset derived from microarray hybridisations we wanted to find out if imprinted genes form a subset of genes expressed in a particular fashion in human and mouse.

the raw microarray data were preprocessed and normalized as described in the methods section. we confined the analysis to genes that were present on the respective expression arrays  and which exhibited a confirmed imprinting status  in at least one species. for human,  <dig> imprinted genes met such criteria , and in mouse  <dig> . this list also includes genes reported to be imprinted in certain tissues only but not in others. as information on tissue specific imprinting is only available for some but not all imprinted genes the consideration of tissue-specific imprinting is not feasible for an unsupervised genome-wide approach. the array data did not allow distinguishing expression of the parental alleles. our analysis could therefore only address the overall expression level. in the analysis of human gene expression we included  <dig> postnatal tissues and placental tissue. for the mouse, data sets for oocyte, fertilised egg and five embryonic stages were included. unfortunately, such data was not available for the human.

we first analysed the expression profiles of human and mouse separately. the aim was to identify tissues that differ considerably from other samples in terms of their expression profiles of imprinted genes. we performed biclustering . the resulting biclustered expression matrices from separate human and mouse expression analyses are shown in figure 1a and 1b.

for human, placenta forms a clearly separate branch  in the clustered tree of tissues . in the 2nd split pancreas branches off , followed by a 3rd split branch formed by pituitary, ovary, and adrenal gland. in the clustered tree of imprinted genes, gnas clusters apart after the 1st split followed by dlk <dig> in the 2nd split. the expression of both genes differs significantly from the other genes in all tissues . while gnas was highly expressed in all tissues, dlk <dig> is significantly over-expressed in placenta, adrenal gland, ovary and pituitary and the high expression is relevant for the clustering of these tissues . regarding the 3rd split, the remaining imprinted genes branch into two large clusters . the first group, consisting of ins, kcnq <dig>  slc22a <dig>  ndn, nnat, snrpn, peg <dig>  cdkn1c, mest, atp10a, grb <dig>  igf <dig>  sgce, peg <dig>  zim <dig>  comprises genes expressed at largely median level. among those ins stands out, that is remarkably over-expressed only in pancreas, the major insulin producing organ of the body. igf <dig>  peg <dig> and cdkn1c are strongly -expressed in placenta. the second cluster consists of phlda <dig>  plagl <dig>  ppp1r9a, diras <dig>  l3mbtl, wt <dig>  hymai, dlx <dig>  mkrn <dig>  tp <dig>  ube3a, magel <dig> with all genes showing a relative under-expression with respect to the tissue expression median. phlda <dig> and plagl <dig> are clearly downregulated in almost all tissues but strongly over-expressed in placenta. the genes that contributed most to the specific expression pattern of placenta and pancreas were those that were either strongly up or downregulated compared to their expression in other tissues. the placental expression pattern was dominated by dlk <dig>  phlda <dig>  cdkn1c, mest, peg <dig> and igf <dig>  for pancreas, ins, dlk <dig>  snrpn, mest kcnq <dig> and hymai were the most prominent genes. finally, for the 3rd split, a cluster which consisted of adrenal gland, ovary and pituitary, we applied random forest analysis to determine which genes contributed most to the formation of that cluster. these were dlk <dig> , ppp1r9a , hymai , peg <dig> , mest , atp10a , zim <dig> . applying a random forest analysis to the same tissues in mouse identifies dlk <dig> , sgce , kcnq <dig> , phlda <dig> , gtl <dig> , inpp5f , usp <dig>  as major contributors.

in mouse tissues the clustering has some similarities to human but also clearly distinct features. pituitary and brain tissues branch off together at the 1st split. this branching is predominantly caused by seven genes which we identified applying a random forest analysis as: gtl <dig> , rasgrf <dig> , nap1l <dig> , impact , inpp5f , mirg , rian . applying a random forest analysis to the same brain tissues in human results in the following genes: peg <dig> , peg <dig> , zim <dig> , snrpn , nnat , slc22a <dig> , ppp1r9a . in the 2nd split embryonic tissues separate from the adult ones . the highest scoring genes for this cluster in a random forest analysis were: igf <dig> , h <dig> , grb <dig> , cdkn1c , slc38a <dig> , plagl <dig> , peg <dig> . most notably igf <dig>  h <dig>  and cdkn1c that dominate this branch lie in the bws region and, together with phlda <dig>  are all highly expressed in embryonic tissues . when omitting these four genes, from the clustering analysis the specific branching and clustering of embryonic stages is lost . among the postnatal tissues, adrenal gland splits off in 3rd branch .

the clustering of imprinted genes in the mouse shows that a series of genes play a role for the branching into embryonic and brain specific clusters at the 1st/2nd split. aside from the predominant expression profile of h <dig> , the remaining genes split into  <dig> clusters . one is the group characterised by moderate to high expression which splits into two clusters , where the cluster of gtl <dig>  inpp5f, nap1l <dig>  ndn, nnat, dlk <dig>  peg <dig>  grb <dig> and plagl <dig> shows high expression in brain tissues. the second group is characterised by moderate to low expression and falls into two clusters according to the 2nd split. of these, the cluster of slc38a <dig>  peg <dig> and zim <dig> shows mainly low expression throughout the tissues.

additional clustering  by combination of euclidean and manhattan distances, respectively, was generated with either complete or average linkage. for mouse, the structures of the obtained trees were very similar to the ones shown in figure  <dig>  the human clustering was found to be less stable . however, placenta always separated in the first splits and in most analyses, pancreas separated in the 2nd whereas adrenal gland and pituitary as well as amygdala and hypothalamus separated in the 2nd or 3rd.

imprinted genes do not show prominent overexpression in distinct tissues
we next analysed whether imprinted genes on average are more strongly expressed in certain tissues compared to the non-imprinted genes present on the arrays . for the analysis we sampled groups of non-imprinted genes   <dig> times and compared their relative expression levels to the average expression of imprinted genes. these analyses were performed separately for each tissue. for human, the median expression levels of imprinted and non-imprinted genes were not significantly different . in mouse, hypothalamus showed a slightly increased median expression compared to other tissues .

we also compared the distribution of expression levels of imprinted and non-imprinted genes across tissues. testing included either all non-imprinted genes on the array or randomly sampled sets. in both cases we observe similar distributions of standard deviations of expression levels across tissues between imprinted and non-imprinted genes  on the array . testing against randomly sampled gene sets the distributions of human and mouse standard deviations did not differ significantly from genomic background. thus, the overall variability across tissues in relative expression of individual imprinted genes is not remarkably high with a few exceptions such as dlk <dig> and ins in human and h <dig> and ins <dig> in mouse.

as a sum, imprinted genes show a median expression across tissues similar to non-imprinted genes. except for a slight tendency in mouse hypothalamus, imprinted genes do not show a particular tissue-specific enrichment compared to the genome-wide average in either adult tissues or mouse embryonic tissues. in addition, imprinted genes did not show reduced or increased variability in tissue-specific expression levels. this suggests that on average imprinted genes tend neither to be expressed at almost constant levels in all tissues  nor to be only expressed in very few tissues.

we next tested whether any two tissues differ significantly. adjusting for multiple testing in human tissues, no tissue pair reaches significance. in mouse,  <dig> tissue pairs out of  <dig> show a p value <  <dig> . by chance we would expect  <dig> pairs with a p value of less than  <dig> . thus we observe approximately a  <dig> fold increase. furthermore, pairwise comparison of embryonic tissues  with adult tissues resulted in  <dig> pairs with p value <  <dig>  . hypothalamus is the tissue with the highest median expression level and shows significant over-expression in comparison to  <dig> tissues . the detailed matrix is given in an additional table .

the biclustered expression matrices  illustrate that several imprinted genes have conspicuous expression behaviour across tissues. h <dig> is such an outlier gene which in mouse is highly expressed at all embryonic stages and in skeletal muscle. others, such as gnas/gnas, are strongly expressed in many tissues of one but not the other species pointing towards more general expression differences between human and mouse at this locus. finally, in some tissues individual outliers show extensive differences in the relative expression between both species. an example is cdkn1c, which is highly expressed in adrenalgland in the mouse but only moderately in human , although the general correlation between cdkn1c and cdkn1c across all tissues is rather high .

overall, we observe that in pairwise comparisons imprinted genes are more highly expressed in mouse embryo than in adult tissues, especially bonemarrow, heart, lung, lymphnode, pancreas, prostate, salivarygland, testis, thymus, thyroid. the highest expression levels are observed for genes in the bws region, namely h <dig>  cdkn1c, phlda <dig> and igf <dig>  these genes dominate the biclustering of embryonic and placental samples in figure 1b whereas other genes behave rather inconspicuously at embryonic stages.

we also calculated the pairwise pearson correlation coefficients for genes within particular imprinted regions, i.e. regions which at least contained three verified imprinted genes annotated to the same chromosomal band. the analysis shows that expression profiles show no more similarity among imprinted genes of a common cluster/chromosomal band than genes that reside in different regions .

already the biclustered expression matrices  indicated that maternally and paternally imprinted genes, respectively, do not cluster together according to their tissue specific expression profiles. calculation of pearson correlation supports this notion showing that the parental origin of expression has no influence on tissue-specific expression profiles . still, overall, paternally expressed genes tend to be more highly expressed than maternal genes .

orthologous imprinted genes in man and mouse exhibit relaxed correlation of tissue specific expression
we next investigated whether tissue-specific expression is correlated for orthologous imprinted genes in human and mouse . overall, orthologous gene pairs showed higher correlation than non-orthologous pairs  =  <dig> ; off diagonal entries: median =  <dig> ; std =  <dig> ). this difference is significant . genes with the highest correlation values were: ins/ins <dig>  =  <dig> ); cdkn1c/cdkn1c ; igf2/igf <dig> ; peg3/peg <dig> , and dlk1/dlk <dig> . no correlation – i.e., a pearson correlation of approximately zero – was observed for: pp1r9a/ppp1r9a, grb10/grb <dig>  kcnq1/kcnq <dig>  and mkrn3/mkrn <dig>  in general, for imprinted orthologous gene pairs the correlation  across tissues is higher than genewise correlation of non imprinted orthologs . the values for gene pairs derived from the genomic background are in agreement with published results derived using slightly different methods  <cit> .

in addition, we analysed if analogous tissues show similar expression profiles of orthologous imprinted genes in human and mouse. out of a set of  <dig> available orthologous genes we randomly sampled  <dig> times genes of the same size as the imprinted gene set. for a given tissue we determined pearson correlation coefficients comparing the relative expression profiles in human and mouse for each set of sampled genes. thus, we derived  <dig> pearson correlation coefficients for the sampled gene sets and one for the imprinted gene set for each of the  <dig> tissues.

for  <dig> of  <dig> tissues, the correlation of expression of imprinted genes is in the 25% to 75% interquartile range  of randomly sampled orthologous genes . in trachea, imprinted genes correlated slightly worse . in adrenal gland, pancreas, and pituitary, the correlation was stronger than in the set of random genes . although the correlation coefficient of placenta was between the 1st and 3rd quartiles , it shows a clear tendency towards higher correlation in imprinted genes than in randomly sampled sets. in summary, the correlation values of human and mouse orthologous imprinted genes are not very different from those of randomly sampled non-imprinted orthologous genes . in a few endocrine tissues we observe a strong expression correlation for orthologous imprinted genes. this finding is in line with previous individual expression reports on a few candidates in human and mouse  <cit> .

a few genes dominate expression profiles in distinct tissues
using correspondence analysis, we next examined the relative contribution of individual genes to tissue specific expression profiles in human and mouse. briefly, we applied a two way table  correspondence analysis for describing/uncovering correspondence between rows  and columns . originally, the method was described by berzerci  <cit> . for this, a high dimensional space of data points  is constructed, such that the dimensions capture the variance explained by the given data in increasing order. rotating the high dimensional data, they are projected onto a  <dig> dimensional planar in a way that maximal variance can be seen according to the first and second axis. in our application, this allows for studying associations between genes and tissues as shown in a two dimensional display . objects  with similar correlations are clustered together resulting in small angles, whereas dissimilar objects are separated from each other , furthermore, the larger the vector length the higher the information content. in figure  <dig>  each point, i.e. tissue  or gene , marks the direction and distance of a vector originating from the centroid. the appearance of vectors in the same quadrants and a closer angle distance between vectors reflects their relative association. while correspondence analysis allows us to visualize associations in complex matrices, it should be noted that there is no threshold to decide whether an association is strong or weak, the vectors describe relative associations, i.e. stronger or weaker than another.

examples for such associations are mouse pituitary and human placenta which are associated with dlk1/dlk <dig> and peg3/peg <dig> in the second quadrant. further examples are  mouse placenta and plagl1/plagl <dig>   mouse pituitary, human placenta and peg3/peg <dig>  and  human adrenal gland, pituitary, ovary and nnat/nnat, ndn/ndn.

overall, however, the correspondence analysis  revealed highest variance between human and mouse tissues, with only human placenta being an exception . thus, almost all human and mouse tissues were clearly separated . a strong association was seen between gnas and all human tissues except for pancreas, adrenal gland, ovary, pituitary, and placenta. ins/ins <dig> showed a strong association with mouse pancreas but less so with human pancreas, while slc22a <dig> showed a stronger association with human pancreas. dlk <dig> was associated with mouse pituitary .

distinct sets of transcription factor binding sites correlate to tissue-specific expression patterns of imprinted genes
next, we questioned whether tissue-specific expression of imprinted genes is regulated by a well defined set of transcription factors. addressing a possible connection between tissue-specific imprinted gene expression and predicted transcription factor binding sites , we again applied a correspondence analysis. we computed a matrix of predicted tfbss  in the upstream region of the respective genes . by multiplying this score matrix with the matrix of relative expression strength of the respective genes we derived a score matrix that relates human tissues and tfbs enrichment based on the studied set of imprinted genes. for visualization we performed a correspondence analysis .

the analysis reveals that imprinted genes expressed in human placenta are more frequently associated with binding sites for xpf <dig>  nfkappab <dig>  er, mtf <dig>  sf <dig>  gli, tef, dr <dig>  mef <dig> and cp <dig>  in fact, xpf <dig>  tef, mtf <dig>  sf <dig>  gli, mef <dig> and cp <dig> were also present on the expression array and we found xpf <dig>  mtf <dig>  sf <dig>  gli and cp <dig> to be upregulated  in human placenta . we further extracted human placenta-expressed genes from the expression dataset and explored whether the same group of transcription factors binding sites were enriched. in fact, all tfbss except for xpf <dig> and mef <dig> showed significant enrichment. nfkappab <dig> had a p-value of  <dig> *10- <dig>  tef  <dig> *10- <dig>  dr <dig>  <dig> *10- <dig>  er  <dig> , mtf <dig>  <dig> *10- <dig>  sf <dig>  <dig> *10- <dig>  gli  <dig> *10- <dig> and cp <dig>  <dig> * 10- <dig> while xpf <dig> and mef <dig> had a p-value of  <dig> . after adjustment for elevated gc content of the upstream regions of imprinted genes, binding sites for nfkappab <dig>  tef, mtf <dig>  sf <dig> and cp <dig> still showed clear enrichment, while binding sites for dr <dig>  er, and gli showed no enrichment. in summary, nfkappab <dig>  tef, mtf <dig>  sf <dig> and cp <dig> displayed placenta-specific tfbs enrichment. binding sites for xpf <dig> were significantly enriched in the upstream regions of imprinted genes but not in those of placenta-expressed genes, with or without gc content adjustment.

in mouse, the same tfbss were significantly enriched as in the human set, namely for nfkappab <dig>  tef, mtf <dig>  sf <dig> and cp <dig> . in addition, dr <dig> and gli binding sites also showed significant enrichment. overall, the results were comparable between human and mouse imprinted genes.

prominent examples of tissues specific tfbs associations in imprinted genes can also be observed for adrenal gland, pituitary and ovary . as for the clustering of human imprinted genes expression,  the multiplied dataset consisting of tfbs enrichment and expression displays a very pronounced cluster of pituitary, adrenal gland and ovary. the strongest associations to these tissues as can be directly read from figure 5c are hen <dig>  lxrr <dig>  mrf <dig>  cebp, rp <dig>  heb and xvent <dig> binding sites. while xvent <dig> is not represented on the array, hen <dig>  mrf <dig> and cebp show a very pronounced upregulation in ovary and pituitary . for adrenal gland these are hen <dig> and cebp while mrf <dig> is at least  <dig>  fold upregulated.

discussion
a general observation of our analysis is that imprinted genes are expressed in a broad range of adult tissues and placenta in human and mouse. for most tissues, the correlation of expression patterns of imprinted genes in human and mouse is not pronounced and does not differ from that of other randomly selected orthologous genes. furthermore, the organization of imprinted genes into genomic clusters does not coincide with coordinated tissue-specific gene expression patterns within these genomic regions. besides the overall "inconspicuous" expression behaviour of imprinted genes we observe particular expression patterns of subsets of imprinted genes in certain human and mouse tissues. tissues with distinct expression profiles such as placenta, adrenal gland, ovary and pituitary show a remarkable correlative association with distinct tfbss in the promoter regions of imprinted genes. as very little is known about transcription factors that regulate imprinted genes the identified associated factors are good candidates for experimental studies on tissue-specific regulation of imprinted genes. in addition, various imprinted zinc finger protein genes have been identified that may act as transcription factors. among these is plagl1/plagl <dig> that is strongly associated with murine placenta and apparently possesses the potential to regulate igf <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> , and also peg3/peg <dig> that is associated with mouse pituitary and human placenta.

in line with the parental conflict hypothesis  <cit> , embryonic development and placental phenotypes are associated with imprinting mutations and imprinted gene expression  <cit> . we observe that imprinted genes do not show a generally stronger correlation of tissue-specific expression patterns in human and mouse and hence are unlikely to form a "uniform class" of genes whose functions are restricted to the same tissues and  stages in both species. it will be interesting to extend detailed tissue specific comparisons to mouse/human embryonic stages to find out if distinctive tissue specific patterning is observed during prenatal development. so far our analysis  indeed suggests that the overall expression of imprinted genes in embryo and placenta is distinct from adult tissues. however, this distinction results from an exceptional expression of a rather small group of imprinted genes, with most being located in the bws region.

one major observation of our analysis is that species specific subsets of imprinted genes form groups with pronounced expression correlation in adrenal gland, pancreas, and pituitary in human and mouse. in the correspondence analysis plots, these three organs and also placenta separate from the vast majority of tissues. all four organs  play prominent roles in the energy metabolism of mammals: the placenta acts as the key organ in nutrient transfer between mother and embryo, and the adrenal gland, pancreas, and pituitary secrete factors, such as insulin and hormones, that play major roles in carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . thus, coordinated imprinted gene expression in these organs may be of importance for balanced physiological pathways in energy supply. this supports the parental conflict hypothesis to some extent, which proposes imprinted genes as regulators of growth and maternal nutrient supply. interestingly, we observe a trend towards higher expression levels of paternally expressed genes. it will be interesting to find out if these genes are particularly involved in regulating nutrient demand or other discussed functions of these endocrine tissues, such as stress response, salt and fluid balance.

several imprinting syndromes suggest that  imprinted genes fulfil important neuronal functions and hence may be particularly expressed in certain neuronal tissues  <cit> . although hypothalamus, amygdala and cerebellum cluster apart from other tissues in mouse , they do not separate from other tissues in human. also, the correspondence analysis separates brain tissues only marginally from other tissues in mouse. hence, at least for human and mouse, particular brain-tissue specific expression profiles are likely to be species specific. in the human, the lack of particular profiles in certain brain tissues  may even indicate that here imprinted control might be confined to only a few genes such as ndn and snrpn. however such extreme interpretations have to be taken with great caution given the fact that some genes such as gnas or dlk <dig> show a strong and broadly extended expression pattern in most human tissues including brain.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, imprinted genes are expressed in a broad range of tissues in the adult of human and mouse. according to their overall expression pattern they do not form a particular class of autosomally expressed genes. however, subsets of imprinted genes are strongly expressed in the pituitary, adrenal gland, pancreas and placenta. hence particular expression patterns are found in tissues regulating hormonal and nutritional homoeostasis in both human and mouse. such correlated expression and the enrichment of tissue specific tfbss suggest mechanisms of co-regulation of selected imprinted genes in organs/tissues controlling hormonal pathways and growth physiology in both species.
