BACKGROUND
chromium is a transition metal most commonly found in the environment in its trivalent  and hexavalent  forms  <cit> . naturally occurring cr is almost exclusively in the trivalent state, as the energy required for its oxidation is high. hence, the hexavalent form is usually considered to be a man-made product  <cit> . the toxicities of the two forms of chromium are vastly different. trivalent chromium is generally a nontoxic, nonmobile micronutrient  <cit> . hexavalent chromium is water soluble, toxic, and carcinogenic, and is considered a pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency   <cit> . chromium is the second most common inorganic contaminant of groundwater at hazardous waste sites  <cit> . the solubility and negative charge of its more common forms, chromate and dichromate , lead to limited adsorption in aquifer minerals, and results in high mobility of cr6+ in aquifers  <cit> . the historical and present day contamination of groundwater and soils by cr6+ is a result of its industrial uses, including metal plating , pigment production, and lumber and wood products   <cit> .

many water sources are at low temperatures year round  and it is important to evaluate the possibility of remediating cr6+ contamination using microorganisms adapted to these low temperatures . limitations of bioremediation processes at low temperatures have been described in the past as having slow biomass build-up rates, slow degradation and low loads  <cit> . furthermore, many bioremediation processes depend on anaerobic cr6+ reduction and it is commonly believed that anaerobic bioreactors are particularly hard to operate at ambient groundwater temperatures  <cit> . recent efforts have tested the possibilities for aerobic and anaerobic low temperature bioremediation of contaminants other than cr6+ including biostimulation and bioaugmentation  <cit> .

to date, there have been few reports of psychrophilic cr6+-reducing organisms  <cit> . mesophilic genera capable of cr6+ reduction include: acinetobacter  <cit> , aerococcus  <cit> , aeromonas  <cit> , aspergillus  <cit> , bacillus  <cit> , corynebacterium  <cit> , deinococcus  <cit> , desulfomicrobium  <cit> , desulfovibrio  <cit> , enterobacter  <cit> , escherichia  <cit> , microbacterium  <cit> , micrococcus  <cit> , ochrobactrum  <cit> , pseudomonas  <cit> , rhodobacter  <cit> , shewanella  <cit> , staphylococcus  <cit> , streptomyces  <cit> , vibrio  <cit> , and zoogloea  <cit> . since mesophilic cr6+ reduction can proceed both aerobically and anaerobically  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that psychrophilic reductions will also proceed both aerobically and anaerobically. most studies referenced were performed at temperatures at or above 20°c. the single low temperature  study involving a soil community and varying electron acceptors yielded significant reduction of cr6+  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, no low temperature groundwater studies  on the reduction of cr6+ have been performed. the use of indigenous psychrophilic microorganisms may provide insight into many of the problems associated with low temperature remediation.

this study used samples obtained from a cr6+  contaminated site within the hanford aquifer  as inocula from which indigenous psychrophilic microorganisms were cultured and tested for their ability to reduce cr6+ to levels below the required epa minimum. identification of psychrophilic cr-reducing community members will allow future studies of remediation possibilities using indigenous populations at other sites as well as help guide the search for other closely related psychrophilic microorganisms for use in remediating cr6+ present in low temperature environments.

RESULTS
enrichments
enrichments with cr6+ concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> mg/l showed growth in the form of turbidity  at 10°c. subsequent transfers of cultures to like concentrations of cr6+-containing media also produced turbidity. clearing of the vb broth  to colorless or pale white and formation of a white precipitate occurred in the  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l cr6+ concentration enrichments and in a preliminary reduction study, but not in the uninoculated controls. enrichments attempted in media containing cr6+ concentrations of > <dig> mg/l grew poorly.

consortium reduction experiments
all enrichment cultures showed evidence of cr6+ removal as the decolorization of media  and measurement of the decreasing cr6+ concentration by the diphenyl carbazide assay. standards and controls in each of the experiments were used to compare the amount of cr6+ left in the media at approximately  <dig> hour intervals. no reduction was observed in cell-free controls. the overall averages and standard deviations of the three samples taken from each of the triplicate tubes in the three serial reduction experiments are represented by data provided in figure  <dig>  the enrichments containing  <dig> mg/l cr6+ were completely reduced in approximately  <dig> days at 10°c and the  <dig> mg/l cr6+ proceeded to zero in less than  <dig> days at 10°c.

isolations
in order to select for organisms that were both resistant to cr6+ and able to reduce cr6+, the original enrichments were performed at high levels of cr6+. streaking for isolation on vb plates  from a  <dig> mg/l cr6+ liquid enrichment yielded an isolate .

isolate reduction experiments
isolate p <dig> cultures showed evidence of cr6+ removal in vb media as the decolorization of media  and measurement of the decreasing cr6+ concentration by the diphenyl carbazide assay similar to the consortium reduction experiments. standards and controls in each of the experiments were used to compare the amount of cr6+ left in the media at approximately  <dig> hour intervals. p <dig> grew poorly in vb media without the addition of cr6+. no reduction was observed in the cell-free controls. the overall averages and standard deviations of the three samples, taken from each of the triplicate tubes in the three serial reduction experiments, are represented by data provided in figure  <dig>  the enrichments containing  <dig> mg/l cr6+ were completely reduced in less than  <dig> hours at 10°c and the  <dig> mg/l cr6+ proceeded to zero in less than  <dig> hours at 10°c.

consortium adsorption experiments
cr6+ removal was not evidenced in adsorption experiments. consortium cells suspended in deionized water and cr6+ retained the yellow color of cr6+-contaminated media. concentrations of cr6+ were statistically unchanged by the end of the  <dig> hour period as measured using the diphenyl carbazide assay. temperature did not affect the adsorption experiments.

16s rdna identification and phylogenetic analysis of isolate p4
pcr amplification and subsequent sequencing yielded an approximately  <dig>  kbp dna fragment consistent with the expected length of the amplification product. a fragment of  <dig> unambiguous bases was used in the search and analysis of related microorganisms. ribosomal database project and genbank database searches both resulted in the high sequence homology  to arthrobacter aurescens. subsequent phylogenetic analysis also revealed the isolate to be a strain of a. aurescens .

discussion
this study demonstrates that indigenous microbial populations present in cr6+-contaminated aquifers are able to aerobically catalyze the removal of toxic and soluble cr6+ from the media, most likely reducing it to the relatively nontoxic and insoluble cr3+. the absence of cr6+ in the media, in addition to the lack of adsorption demonstrated by the three separate adsorption experiments, suggests the cr6+ was reduced to the less toxic cr3+ form. further experimentation with cell lysates of p <dig> at 18°c showed cr6+-reduction activity in the soluble protein fraction, not the membrane bound protein fraction, also suggesting enzymatic reduction . the low temperature  used in the experiments and the timeline for the reductions also suggests that cr6+ can be remediated in a reasonable amount of time at the low environmental temperatures present in many aquifers. in comparison, a mesophilic isolate from another study, arthrobacter crystallopoites strain es  <dig>  <cit>  reported a lower rate of chromate reduction at 30°c when compared to isolate p <dig> at 10°c. interestingly, es  <dig> had a higher temperature optimum for cr6+ reduction than for optimal cell growth  <cit> . the lack of previous low temperature studies is clearly demonstrated by a search of the literature in which only a single paper by tseng and bielefeldt  <cit>  on the low temperature biotransformation of hexavalent chromium in soil is found.

both the consortium and p <dig> isolate cultures were shown to grow and reduce cr6+ at 10°c. significant biomass of the p <dig> isolate could be generated within  <dig> days of growth in r <dig> broth at 10°c . studies using mesophilic microorganisms from genera such as bacillus, pseudomonas and escherichia  <cit>  all required incubation at temperatures well above those used in this study and those found in the aquifer environment we are targeting for bioremediation.

a number of studies suggest both growth-dependent and growth-independent chromium reduction  <cit> . in either case, chromium reduction does seem to be biomass dependent in our study as well as in others  <cit> . the lag at the beginning of the consortium reduction experiments as well as observations of increased turbidity throughout the experiments suggests that adequate cell biomass must be produced before reduction begins in earnest. bopp and ehrlich  <cit>  showed that higher concentrations  of cr6+ produced a much longer lag phase and a significantly lower final yield of biomass than lower concentrations. the reduced biomass would also contribute to the lack of complete reduction found at higher concentrations in many studies  <cit>  as well as in the higher concentrations tested in our lab . previous studies using cellular biomass grown on uncontaminated substrates to test cr6+ reduction greatly decreased the amount of time required to completely reduce cr6+  <cit> , similar to our findings with the isolate p <dig> reduction experiments . increased turbidity after only  <dig> hours in r <dig> broth at 10°c  and the achievement of stationary phase  after  <dig> days suggests that p <dig> is relatively fast growing. p <dig> grew at  <dig>   <dig>  and 25°c but not at 37°c suggesting the isolate is a true psychrophile. growth appeared fastest at 18°c. the ability to increase biomass in a short time given the proper nutrients suggests that p <dig> could be useful in bioremediation using nutrient addition.

the enrichment culture and isolate p <dig> consistently reduced cr6+ in vb medium up to concentrations of  <dig> mg/l cr6+. higher concentrations seemed to inhibit reduction, although growth was slower but still observed as turbidity in the enrichments . dilution of the cr6+ at  <dig> mg/l may have affected the limited range of the diphenyl carbazide assay, causing the appearance of the lack of reduction at higher concentrations. both the consortium and isolate p <dig> showed significant tolerance of cr6+ up to concentrations of  <dig> mg/l  as well as measurable reduction over short periods of time at concentrations up to  <dig> mg/l cr6+. this tolerance is greater than or comparable to most mesophilic microorganisms tested, such as pseudomonas fluorescens at  <dig>  mg/l  <cit>  and bacillus sp. at  <dig> mg/l  <cit> . furthermore, the isolate p <dig> and consortium reductions presented here occurred at temperatures close to 30°c lower than in the studies using mesophilic organisms, suggesting that the enzyme responsible for the reduction are truly cold-active.

complete reduction was observed in all experiments  with concentrations of cr6+ up to  <dig> mg/l  suggesting that complete reduction in the environment is also possible. the lack of reduction in the sterile controls along with the lack of cr6+ adsorption to cell biomass in the three adsorption experiments suggests that the members of the enrichment community  were responsible for the reduction of cr6+. since most aquifers contaminated with cr6+ have levels below  <dig> mg/l, these experiments would also suggest remediation of the lower levels of cr6+ contamination present in aquifers is possible. bioremediation literature suggests low levels of contamination are very difficult to completely remediate. lack of induction of enzyme systems at low contaminant concentrations and problems with availability of contaminants bound to organics and sequestered in other matrices all contribute to persistence of contaminants in the environment. it has also been suggested that indigenous microorganisms may be more successful in reducing low contaminant concentrations  <cit> . the complete reduction of cr6+ at 10°c in this study using an indigenous member of the hanford microbial community and past studies with indigenous mesophilic microorganisms suggest that there are environmental candidates for reduction of the low levels of contamination usually found in aquifers  <cit> .

studies have shown arthrobacter species adsorbing fe, cd, and cu, but not cr  <cit> . chromium has, however, been shown to adsorb to both shewanella and bacillus species  <cit> . adsorption studies performed on the hanford consortium in our laboratory  did not show significant removal of cr6+ due to adsorption. three separate adsorption studies used killed  cells, metabolically inhibited live cells, or lyophilized cells. none of these studies showed significant adsorption of cr6+ within  <dig> hours of cr6+ addition. these, along with studies showing activity in the soluble fraction of lysate, suggest enzymatic reduction.

a few arthrobacter species, like a. oxydans and a. crystallopoites strain es <dig> have been noted previously to reduce cr6+  <cit> . identification of a. oxydans to the species level in the previous study was performed via fatty acid methyl ester  analysis, while es  <dig> was characterized by 16s rdna sequencing. carmargo et al.  <cit>  showed es  <dig> to have its optimum cr6+ reduction in a temperature range of 30–35°c, but did not test its cr6+ reduction rates below 25°c. p <dig>  by comparison, grew well and reduced cr6+ at 10°c at a faster rate than es  <dig> at 30–35°c. further comparison of the two organisms  reveals a much lower starting concentration of cr6+ for the reduction studies using es  <dig> . reduction of cr6+ using p <dig> at 10°c proceeded at a rate  <dig>  times faster than es  <dig> at 30°c . as for cr6+ resistance, isolate p <dig> tolerated up to  <dig> mg/l cr6+ while isolate es  <dig> was from a group that had low tolerance above  <dig> mg/l cr6+  <cit> . within these comparisons, isolate p <dig> is more resistant and reduces higher concentrations of cr6+at a significantly faster rate.

in the current study, the identification of isolate p <dig> as a strain of a. aurescens was performed via 16s rdna sequencing with comparison to sequences found in the ribosomal database project and the genbank database at ncbi. to the best of our knowledge, the species a. aurescens has not been previously associated with cr6+ reduction.

CONCLUSIONS
considering the ubiquity of organisms in the genus arthrobacter, we suggest further exploration of the in situ metal reduction potential of this under-studied genus. resistance and tolerance of arthrobacter spp. have been demonstrated to a wide variety of heavy metals including mercury, chromium, lead, nickel and copper  <cit> . that, together with arthrobacter's ability to reduce cr6+ and other toxic metals, indicates that arthrobacter spp. indigenous to the subsurface have potential to be useful metal reducers in enhanced, in situ, subsurface bioremediation efforts involving cr6+ and other heavy metals and radionuclides.
