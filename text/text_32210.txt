BACKGROUND
the influenza a virus causes epidemics and pandemics  <cit>  in humans, other mammals and birds. the disease severity varies significantly. recognizing danger factors by sequence analysis helps assess the virulence potential of a given strain. the pb1-f <dig> is a key danger factor which distinguishes the major flu pandemics of the 20th century  from the milder  <dig> h1n <dig> “swine flu” pandemic. the presence of this alternative reading frame protein product helps assess virulence of emerging viruses.

pb1-f <dig> is encoded in an alternative reading frame of the pb <dig> gene . pb <dig> is an obligatory protein product that enables viral replication, while pb1-f <dig> is present in some, but not all pb1-coding sequences. it is a pro-apoptotic factor, increasing virulence and the risk of secondary infections  <cit> . pb1-f <dig> expression is blocked in some strains due to premature stop codons  <cit> . pb1-f <dig> increases virulence through the induction of cell death, induction of inflammation, or polymerase activity enhancement  <cit> . the  <dig> h1n <dig> is characterized by low virulence. it lacks pb1-f <dig> due to premature stop codons. for example, a stop codon  at the nucleotide position  <dig> of pb <dig> gene in a/massachusetts/06/ <dig> truncates the potential pb1-f <dig> after  <dig> amino acids. in contrast, the virulent a/brevig mission/1/ <dig> strain contains codon tca at position  <dig>  encoding a serine at position  <dig> of pb1-f <dig>  in the pb <dig> reading frame, c129a is a silent mutation: both alternative codons, gtc and gta, encode valine at amino acid position  <dig> of the pb <dig> protein. variants of pb1-f <dig> have been reported of lengths  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> amino acids  <cit> .

since the influenza virus is an rna virus, the identification of pb1-f <dig> from heterogeneous sources  requires translation of the rna sequence in  <dig> reading frames. candidate protein products  are encoded by all potential open reading frames. all of the potential pb1-f <dig> products are then identified through their similarity between cpps and known pb1-f <dig> sequences. this method was used for annotation of  <dig> verified entries in swiss-prot  while two entries have protein level evidence.

we present an algorithm and web server for scanning nucleotide sequences for the presence of functional pb1-f <dig>  this web tool helps researchers identify whether a newly isolated sequences en-codes a potential pb1-f <dig> product.

implementation
data sources
sequences were obtained from the influenza virus resource, hosted at ncbi  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences were extracted from the influenza.fna file provided on their ftp repository in the fasta format. a set of pb1-f <dig> sequences was obtained from uniprot to serve as a reference panel. only reviewed entries from the curated swiss-prot entries were used, resulting in  <dig> panel sequences. of these  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were of lengths  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. they represent strains isolated from humans , birds , swine  and laboratory strains .

pb1-f <dig> identification
cpps were generated by translating the pb1-encoding influenza a segment  <dig> nucleotide sequences in  <dig> reading frames. cpps shorter than  <dig> amino acids were considered negative because pb1-f <dig> proteins of these lengths have been neither described nor hypothesized to exist. to identify whether a given cpp represents pb1-f <dig>  a distance measure was calculated between the query sequences and all panel members. the distance measure was defined as the number of mismatches in a smith-waterman alignment as a percentage of sequence length. if the distance to the closest panel member is below a set threshold, the cpp is determined to be a pb1-f <dig> product, thus distinguishing it from non-pb1-f <dig> cpps. the algorithm uses a threshold of  <dig> to identify pb1-f <dig> products, which was determined to be discriminatory .

web implementation
all algorithms for this analysis were implemented in the java programming language. the web interface is hosted on an apache tomcat server, written in java and java server pages.

RESULTS
of the  <dig>  influenza sequence entries found in the influenza.fna source file as of december  <dig>   <dig> were pb <dig>  entries. after translating all  <dig> reading frames, and selecting sequences that begin with methionine, and end with a stop codon,  <dig>  candidate protein segments  were produced with a length between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids.

to evaluate the distance measure selectivity across the population of cpps, the distances were plotted against the sequence length . this revealed  <dig> major populations:  sequences which show less than 36% difference compared to the closest panel member, representing pb1-f <dig> cpps and  sequences with greater than 86% difference, representing non-pb1-f <dig> cpps . this figure shows that a conservative cutoff of 40% is effective in distinguishing between these populations.

by employing this strategy for pb1-f <dig> identification, we located pb1-f2-encoding nucleotide sequences throughout the database. of  <dig> pb1-f <dig> entries,  <dig> were determined to encode pb1-f <dig> . there were  <dig> sequences in the database that were previously annotated as encoding pb1-f <dig>  therefore, there we have newly annotated  <dig> pb <dig> entries for the presence of pb1-f2-encoding sequences.

conservation analysis of pb <dig> sequences showed that peptides 15pb <dig> and 114pb <dig> are 94-100% conserved  <cit> . since the pb1-f <dig> start and stop codons fall within these regions respectively, the high level of conservation results in a limited number of pb1-f <dig> length variants. this is clearly shown in figure  <dig>  two major populations of pb1-f <dig> are of lengths  <dig> and  <dig>  several minor populations include lengths  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  additional possible populations include the lengths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  previously described sequences include only lengths  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  however, we have observed substantial variation in pb1-f <dig> sequences where certain variants show up to 35% difference to well-defined reference sequences. therefore this dataset indicates that there are many more variants that need to be functionally characterized. the inspection of multiple sequence alignments has shown the existence of distinct populations that appear to represent various fitness variants. for example, the  <dig> pb1-f <dig> sequences that are  <dig> aa long form  <dig> major sequence subgroups while  <dig> sequences that are  <dig> aa long form three major subgroups. more numerous length variants  have a larger number of major subgroups. our analysis shows that, unfortunately, characterization of this important virulence factor is neglected by mainstream influenza a sequence characterization. our web tool is a contribution to this effort since it provides an initial screen and annotation of pb1-f <dig> products and enables further detailed analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have implemented the pb1-f <dig> analysis algorithm and strategy as a web tool, pb1-f <dig> finder. the user can input a nucleotide sequence  with or without a fasta header line. the application then translates the sequence in three reading frames, digests protein products beginning with methionine, and ending with a stop codon, and assesses the presence of pb1-f <dig> based upon the distance measure described in methods. each of these steps is outlined in a full report to the user. the pb1-f <dig> finder tool is a contribution to the global fight against pandemic influenza.
