BACKGROUND
proteins play critical roles in almost all biological activities within a living system. since the function of a protein is largely dictated by its three dimensional configuration, determining a protein's structure is of fundamental importance to biology. unfortunately, experimental methods for elucidating a protein's structure are often costly and are not always applicable  <cit> . computational prediction techniques provide an attractive alternative; however, the accurate prediction of 3d protein structure directly from amino acid sequence data continues to elude researchers when homologous protein structures are not available , or for longer domains . as an intermediate but useful step, attempts have been made to determine the one dimensional secondary structure of proteins  from primary sequence data  <cit> . a wide variety of methods have been applied to this problem including those based on artificial neural networks   <cit> , hidden markov models   <cit> , information theory  <cit> , linear programming  <cit> , and linear discriminant analysis   <cit> , however no method has achieved the theoretical maximum predictive q <dig> accuracy of 88%  <cit> . interested readers are directed to an excellent review of the state of the art by rost  <cit> . note that this study focuses on predicting secondary structure of globular proteins. excluded proteins include those with coiled-coil regions or trans-membrane domains.

here we report on a novel approach to this problem which makes use of powerful techniques from the field of nonlinear system identification. using divergent evolutionary profiles  <cit>  as input data, parallel cascade identification  <cit>   is used to build multi-input single-output  dynamic nonlinear systems through a black-box approach in order to model the process of protein folding. the application of cascaded pci classifiers suggested in ref.  <cit>  is also used here to great advantage. while pci proved to be a relatively accurate method of predicting secondary structure directly from sequence, pci achieves its greatest accuracy when pci-based classifiers are combined with psipred  <cit> , a leading ann-based method, using a cascaded pci classifier. when evaluated over a new test dataset of  <dig> protein chains sharing no significant sequence similarity to the training data for either method, this combination maintains the highest observed prediction accuracy while reducing the bad score by up to 25%. the bad score measures the percentage of misclassification errors confusing α-helices and β-strands which are known to be particularly damaging for inferring tertiary structure. pci's ability to significantly reduce this error type while maintaining all other performance measures makes the pci-psipred combination particularly well suited for inclusion in tertiary structure prediction pipelines.

pci-ss web server
we have developed an advanced web server for pci-based protein secondary structure prediction. this server, called pci-ss, is available at . in addition to a dynamic php-generated web interface for humans, a simple object access protocol  interface is added to permit invocation of the pci-ss service remotely. several other protein secondary structure human-readable web interfaces are currently available. while these interfaces work well for determining the structure of a single input sequence, such human-readable interfaces are not well suited to automated high-throughput analysis of multiple proteins. with the shift from the reductionist view, that seeks to analyse individual molecules in isolation, to the introduction of systems biology which examines the complex interactions of multiple molecules at a cellular or organism level, biologists are turning to high-throughput analyses that can characterize an entire proteome at once. such analyses are often multi-faceted where, for example, protein structure, sub-cellular localization, interactions, and functional information are considered simultaneously to achieve more information than can be obtained through any single avenue of investigation. this requires that individual sources of information be combined into complex analysis pipelines. again, human-readable web interfaces are not well suited for such pipelines since the input and output data is limited to unstructured text. complex web agent scripts can sometimes be created to simulate the human interactions with a website and painstakingly parse the html output. however, such approaches, often referred to as 'scraping', are prone to failure when a service provider changes so much as the presentation format of the web site providing the service. a number of methods of secondary structure prediction are available for download, to be run locally such as psipred  <cit>  and proteus, a highly accurate method which uses structural templates to augment secondary structure predictions  <cit> . however, a web service oriented architecture may be better suited to biologist users who do not want to download, compile, configure, and maintain software locally, including any required hardware.

emerging web technologies such as simple object access protocol   <cit> , wsdl  <cit> , and xml  <cit>  are useful for creating machine-readable interfaces to web services over http. wsdl is used to define the method interface in a language-independent way. by separating the interface form the implementation, client programs can design for the fixed interface while service providers are free to manage the way in which the service is implemented. furthermore, the wsdl interface enables rapid development of clients in many development languages . by encoding the input and output data using xml, complex data structures may be encoded in a self-describing way that simplifies automated method invocation and parsing of results. these are critical for the successful incorporation of a web service into a high-throughput analysis pipeline.

although at least one other secondary structure makes use of soap for inter-process communication , the interface is not made public nor is a wsdl interface definition provided. to our knowledge, this is the first publicly available soap interface for a protein secondary structure prediction method.

parallel cascade identification
pci is a powerful method of nonlinear system identification that may be used to create a mimetic model of a dynamic nonlinear system given only knowledge of its input and output data  <cit> . no special statistical properties are required of the training data provided that they are sufficiently rich  <cit> . note that any pci model will have equivalent volterra and wiener expansions  <cit> . a pci model consists of a parallel arrangement of cascade models where, in the present study, each cascade is composed of a dynamic linear  component followed by a static nonlinear  polynomial component. during training, cascades are added to the model sequentially, where each new cascade reduces the residual error remaining between the training output and the sum of the outputs of the previously added cascades. prior to training a pci model, four architectural parameters must be set in order to fix the model structure  <cit> . these are: the maximum lag, r, and anticipation length, s, of the dynamic linear component l; the degree, i, of polynomial used for the static nonlinearity n; and a constant, p, related to the minimum mse reduction required of a candidate cascade before it is accepted into the parallel cascade model. in the present study, genetic algorithms  are used to sample this parameter space and to search for a suitable pci architecture  <cit> .

in order to use pci to predict protein secondary structure, the problem must be recast into one of nonlinear system identification as follows: we seek to identify a miso dynamic nonlinear system that can map sequence data onto secondary structure state data. it is conceivable that such a system exists since this mapping occurs in vivo. prior to applying sequence data to the inputs of a pci model, it must first be suitably encoded into a numeric matrix. in the present study, psi-blast  <cit>  is used to generate position-specific scoring matrices  from each query protein chain as first suggested by jones  <cit> . for a query protein of length m, the corresponding pssm is a matrix with m rows and  <dig> columns. in order to use pssm data as input, we make use of a 20-input miso pci model, where each of the  <dig> inputs accepts one column of the pssm. to classify new  sequences, the encoded input data is applied to the trained pci model. the model output is then examined using a decision function in order to classify each input datum. a number of decision functions may be used to perform this final classification. in this study, the mse-test  <cit>  is used. the interested reader is referred to ref.  <cit>  for a more complete treatment of the pci algorithm, and to refs.  <cit>  for a detailed discussion of the use of pci to form bioinformatics binary classifiers.

RESULTS
selection of sequence-unique training/testing data
comparative modeling  is by far the most accurate structure prediction method when a sequence-similar protein with known structure is available  <cit> . it follows that secondary structure prediction techniques are only needed when comparative modeling cannot be applied. therefore predictions should be evaluated using a dataset where no homology exists between training and testing data. gross overestimation of prediction accuracy may result when this is not ensured explicitly at the experiment design stage  <cit> . a list of  <dig> sequence-unique protein chains was retrieved from the eva system  <cit>  on  <dig> may  <dig>  the dataset was then filtered resulting in  <dig> chains  and split into five subsets: the s <dig> subset was used as the optimization set. subsets s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> were used to train and test numerous models in a cross-validation scheme in order to explore a wide variety of algorithmic ideas. once the algorithm exploration stage was complete, the "antitest" dataset was formed from the union of s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> . penultimate classifiers were trained on the antitest dataset and tested on the s <dig> test dataset. note that subset s <dig> was reserved as a test set and was not used to train any classifiers .

sequence-to-structure pci-mse classifiers
three-state sequence-to-structure pci classifiers were formed through a combination of three binary pci classifiers as depicted in figure  <dig> . using the s <dig> optimization dataset , genetic algorithms were applied to optimize the architectural parameters of each binary sequence-to-structure pci model . table  <dig> shows the optimal parameters for each binary pci model. the nonzero values for both r and s would seem to indicate that the secondary structure of the central residue is dependant on neighbouring amino acids both up- and downstream  <cit> . following optimization of the pci architectural parameters, sequence-to-structure pci classifiers were trained over the antitest dataset and were evaluated using the s <dig> test dataset. matthew's correlation coefficients  <cit> , q <dig> accuracy, sov score  <cit> , and the bad score  <cit>  are reported in the first row of table  <dig>  note that q <dig> accuracy surpasses 73% and is approaching the state of the art for contemporary methods.

cascaded pci classifiers
many contemporary secondary structure prediction methods have made use of cascaded classifiers  <cit> . the first classifier acts as a sequence-to-structure classifier . the second classifier is a structure-to-structure classifier that examines a local window of predicted structure and hones the prediction of the structure state. these structure-to-structure classifiers capture purely structural relationships  and correlations that may exist between adjacent structure states. figure  <dig> illustrates a cascaded pci classifier. using the s <dig> optimization dataset, gas were applied to optimize the architectural parameters  of the structure-to-structure pci classifier. optimal architectural parameters are given in table  <dig> for the structure-to-structure pci models . using those architectural parameters found to be optimal, a cascaded pci classifier was trained on the antitest dataset and evaluated over the s <dig> test dataset. significant improvements in all measures of accuracy are observed in table  <dig> when compared with the sequence-to-structure pci-mse classifier described above.

consensus combination of pci with psipred
the combination of multiple diverse predictors has been shown to improve secondary structure prediction accuracy when the individual predictors  do not suffer from the same errors  <cit> . pci has previously been successfully combined with hidden markov models  <cit>  and k-nearest-neighbour classifiers  <cit>  for the analysis of proteins. since pci is a fundamentally different approach to secondary structure prediction from what is currently available, it may not generate the same prediction errors as other methods. a six-input post-pci classifier was formed to combine the raw outputs of three binary sequence-to-structure pci models with the three class distances produced by a psipred  <cit>  classifier as shown in figure  <dig>  the post-pci classifier was trained on the antitest dataset, as were the sequence-to-structure binary pci models used to generate the post-pci input data. the prediction accuracy of psipred alone and in combination with pci classifiers over the s <dig> test dataset are given below in table  <dig>  it is clear from the results below that pci is augmenting the psipred predictions when they are combined using post-pci. not only are fewer errors committed, but the bad score is reduced by 25%. this may indicate that the structure predicted by the combined classifiers could be more useful to subsequent tertiary structure prediction methods than psipred predictions alone  <cit> .

final eva test set
in order to compare pci-based classifiers with contemporary classifiers based on different approaches, a common dataset of  <dig> protein chains that were guaranteed to be non-homologous to all protein data used to train all eight methods was extracted from the eva system  <cit>  . this dataset provides a unique opportunity to directly compare pci's performance with eight leading methods in a fair and objective way. the benefit of using results from the eva system is that we are guaranteed that all test proteins are dissimilar to all training proteins for all methods. no such guarantee is available if non-eva methods are applied to the test dataset now, since there is no way to ensure that these same proteins were not used in the training of each method. we therefore restrict our comparison to methods evaluated by the eva system. excluded methods of interest include one based on support vector machines which appears to achieve similar prediction accuracy to psipred  <cit> , proteus  <cit> , and yaspin  <cit> , which uses a hidden markov model to refine the 7-state predictions from a neural network. although yaspin was included in eva for a short time, unfortunately, archived eva results were only available for a small number of the  <dig> test proteins and therefore this method was excluded. results over those proteins for which archived yaspin were available showed performance on par with cascaded pci.

a cascaded post-pci classifier  was trained over the entire original dataset of  <dig> protein chains, as was a post-pci combination of  <dig> binary pci model raw outputs with three psipred distance outputs. archived results over the  <dig> protein chains comprising the final eva test set were extracted from the eva system  <cit>  for  <dig> methods . columns 2– <dig> of table  <dig> show the prediction accuracy when all  <dig> residues from the  <dig> chains are pooled together, while the last four columns report the average performance when results are calculated on a per-chain basis as is done in eva  <cit> . note that scores computed using this latter approach are typically lower than the first approach due to the effect of poor classifier performance over shorter protein chains. as can be seen in table  <dig>  the cascaded post-pci classifier ranks reasonably well among the top contemporary methods, with higher sov and q <dig> scores than  <dig> of  <dig> methods. furthermore, the post-pci combination of psipred-local with  <dig> binary pci outputs achieves the highest q <dig> and sov scores observed in table  <dig>  and also displays the lowest bad score of any method. while the increase in q <dig> and sov are minimal when compared to psipred alone, the decrease in bad score  is statistically significant with a p-value of  <dig>  when a paired t-test is applied to bad scores measured over each of the  <dig> proteins. this significant reduction in the rate of occurrence of helix-strand confusion is expected to make this method significantly better suited to inclusion in tertiary structure prediction pipelines.

results over the final eva test set of  <dig> new protein chains dissimilar to all training data. cc denotes the average matthews' correlation coefficient observed for the three classes. 'avg per residue' results are calculated over the pool of all residues in the dataset whereas 'avg per chain' results are compiled for each chain prior to computing the average. psipred-local refers to the output of psipred v <dig>  run locally when provided with pssm data generated from the filtered ncbi non-redundant nr database as frozen on  <dig> may  <dig>  psipred-live indicates the performance of the actual psipred server  <cit>  as of the day that each protein chain was added to the eva system. bad-score-rule in the last row shows the results when a rule is applied to combine postpci with psipred to optimize q <dig> score at the cost of bad score .

note that it is possible to improve the q <dig> score slightly  at the expense of performance on the bad score . this may be accomplished by accepting the postpci classification whenever psipred and the postpci consensus classifier differ on a helix-strand prediction. this so called 'bad score rule' replaces the psipred prediction with the postpci consensus prediction whenever psipred predicts strand and postpci predicts helix, or when psipred predicts helix and postpci predicts strand. when this rule is applied to the  <dig> proteins in the eva dataset,  <dig> replacements are made during structure prediction. these results are shown in the last row of table  <dig> 

quality of training data
when developing psipred, jones was careful to select structures that were of high quality, accepting only training protein chains whose structure had been determined through x-ray crystallography with a rms of less than  <dig>  angstroms  <cit> . when constructing the list of unique proteins, the eva system aims to select the chain of highest quality from within a family of similar chains. however, no minimum structure quality criterion is imposed for inclusion in the list  <cit> . to gauge the importance of using only high quality precisely defined structures as training data, the pisces system  <cit>  was used to filter the antitest dataset of training protein chains. only those chains that were solved via x-ray crystallography and whose structures were known within  <dig> angstroms were retained. this reduced the list of training chains from  <dig> to only  <dig>  a pci-mse classifier was trained on the filtered antitest dataset and then evaluated on the unfiltered s <dig> test dataset. a full 1% decrease in q <dig> accuracy was observed for the pisces-trained pci-mse classifier compared to the classifier trained over the unfiltered dataset. this is likely due to the reduced number of training data provided by the filtered training dataset. pci therefore appears to be relatively robust to the quality of the training data.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, pci was used to form the basis for a number of protein secondary structure classifiers. the use of psi-blast  <cit>  to iteratively create multiple sequence alignments of distantly, but significantly related proteins and to build pssms was critical to the success of this study. pci-based classifiers that used pssm input data were shown to be effective on an independent dataset of new protein chains, and compared favourably with  <dig> leading contemporary structure prediction methods. the use of cascaded structure-to-structure pci-mse classifiers  appears to be a highly effective method to refine sequence-to-structure pci-mse classifier outputs and also to combine pci with other methods. when post-pci is used to combine a sequence-to-structure pci-based classifier with a psipred  <cit>  classifier, overall performance is maintained while significantly  reducing the rate of occurrence of a particularly detrimental error by up to 25%. in fact, these post-pci classifiers achieve the highest q <dig> and sov accuracies and lowest bad score observed for any method evaluated in the present study over a novel set of  <dig> protein chains guaranteed to be dissimilar to all proteins used to train all methods.

the use of structure-to-structure consensus pci classifiers to combine sequence-to-structure pci classifiers with a leading ann-based method  <cit>  to achieve an overall increase in quality and accuracy of predicting secondary structure is an exciting outcome. it may be possible to use post-pci to combine pci-based classifiers with other types of classifiers, including hmm-based classifiers. while predicting secondary structure is a useful intermediate step, the ultimate goal of protein structure prediction is to predict the complete 3d structure of the active conformation of a protein given knowledge only of its sequence and its environment. the application of pci to tertiary structure prediction is the logical next step towards this goal. gaining a better understanding of the many post-translational modifications that may occur to a protein that can significantly alter a protein's function is also a worthy goal and pci has already shown promises in this area as well  <cit> .

a web server called pci-ss was created with both a human-readable and machine-readable interface. the human interface follows the design of many existing systems, but adds the ability to download the structure prediction in xml format for easy parsing. intermediate results are also provided, including psi-blast pssm data and a comparison between the consensus pci-ss prediction and its constituent methods. a sample screen shot is provided in figure  <dig>  the machine-invocable soap interface is unique in that it allows the language-independent creation of custom application-specific programs which can invoke pci-ss remotely while completely bypassing the human-readable web interface. this ability combined with xml encoding of the resulting prediction makes pci-ss particularly well suited to incorporation into custom multi-faceted protein analysis pipelines. to facilitate development of custom user programs, two sample perl scripts are provided on the website as examples of how to remotely invoke the method and parse the results. the soap webserver and the significant decrease in bad score will make pci-ss of particular interest to developers of tertiary structure prediction methods.
