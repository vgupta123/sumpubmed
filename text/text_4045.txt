BACKGROUND
classical scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy  of sheep and goats that can be transmitted vertically from dam to offspring and horizontally between animals. horizontal transmission was demonstrated not only between conspecifics but also from sheep to goats under natural conditions  <cit> , whereas natural transmission from goats to sheep has not been reported. one study described the successful transmission of goat scrapie to sheep by intracerebral inoculation of pooled goat brains  <cit>  but this was prior to the development of more sensitive diagnostic methods and before the effect of prion protein gene  genotype on disease susceptibility was known.

three codons are considered important regarding scrapie susceptibility in sheep: codon  <dig>  encoding alanine  or valine , codon  <dig>  encoding arginine  or histidine  and codon  <dig>  encoding glutamine  or arginine . in cheviot sheep, the most susceptible genotype is vv at codon  <dig>  rr at codon  <dig> and qq at codon  <dig>  whereas aa136rr154rr <dig> sheep are considered highly resistant  <cit> . there are other prnp polymorphisms, such as phenylalanine  instead of leucine  at codon  <dig>  which have been associated with atypical scrapie cases  <cit> , and increased survival times were reported in aa <dig> cheviot sheep with an f <dig> allele, which had been experimentally inoculated with classical scrapie  <cit> . prnp polymorphisms also affect classical scrapie susceptibility in goats. for example, lysine  instead of glutamine  at codon  <dig> is associated with increased resistance, and methionine  instead of isoleucine  at codon  <dig> is linked to an increased survival time  <cit> .

a more recent study demonstrated transmission of classical scrapie from a goat  to two of four vv136rr154qq <dig> sheep by oral inoculation with placenta  <cit>  but there was very limited information on the disease phenotype.

the study reported here aimed to provide more detailed information about the clinical, pathological and molecular phenotype of caprine classical scrapie in sheep, in particular with respect to prnp polymorphisms at codon  <dig> that were detected in these sheep. the disease was produced as part of an experiment to assess the infectivity of goat milk following a pilot study to determine susceptibility of sheep to goat scrapie, the results of which were presented separately  <cit> .

methods
animal studies
for the pilot study to determine susceptibility of sheep to goat scrapie, brain homogenates were prepared from two naturally infected anglo-nubian goats  <cit>  according to established methods  <cit> : g <dig> with ii <dig> and g <dig> with im142
prnp genotypes. all goats were from a herd that was culled to eradicate scrapie in accordance with regulation  no 999/ <dig> and its amendments laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. more details on these goats are provided elsewhere  <cit> .

brain recipients were  <dig> cheviot lambs with prnp genotypes vv136rr154qq <dig>  and aa136rr154qq <dig>  born from six ewes from our research flock that was established in england to provide classical scrapie-free sheep for research purposes  <cit> . prnp genotyping was performed as described previously  <cit>  and included polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  which have shown to influence disease in experimentally infected aa sheep  <cit>  . when the study started, recipient sheep were purely selected on the basis of their polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  to determine the most suitable genotype for a goat scrapie transmission study to sheep. as dam and sire of recipient aa sheep were not both homozygous ll <dig> or ff <dig>  recipients were ll <dig>  lf <dig> or ff <dig> 

the lambs were orally challenged within 24 h of birth with 5 g  of one of the two goat brain homogenates. lambs were raised by their dams until weaning at approximately 10 weeks of age in three pens, two of which contained lambs challenged with either g <dig> or g <dig> brain and one housed a mixture of lambs challenged with g <dig> or g <dig> brain . lambs from the different pens were mixed from 35 months of age when the number of animals started to decline.table  <dig> animal details

for the milk transmission study, recipients were six pairs of aa lambs with either ll <dig> or lf141
prnp polymorphisms from the same classical scrapie-free flock because the pilot study implied that aa sheep were more suitable as recipients than vv sheep. as mentioned above, uniform genotypes at codon  <dig> could not be pre-selected in the recipient sheep although this time dams and sire were chosen to produce either ll <dig> or lf <dig> lambs because infection in the pilot study was first demonstrated in aa sheep with an l <dig> allele  <cit> . the lambs were fed milk from six different scrapie-infected goats , which were all from the same herd and included the two goats that also provided brains for the pilot study. once all the goat milk was consumed, lambs were fed milk replacer . pairs of milk recipients were kept separate until scrapie infection was confirmed by rectal biopsy , at which time they were mixed. all sheep were fed straw and concentrates after weaning at approximately 10 weeks of age.

monitoring scrapie infection status
scrapie infection status was determined by the immunohistochemical examination of biopsies of recto-anal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue   <cit>  from 6 months  and 9 months  of age; rectal biopsies were repeated only in sheep with previously negative results.

sheep were monitored twice daily by farm staff and were systematically examined for neurological signs first at 20 months of age, then at 31 months and then usually monthly or more frequently depending on clinical status, using a short examination protocol for detection of scrapie  <cit> . a full neurological examination  <cit>  was carried out prior to culling, and an electrocardiogram was recorded as described previously  <cit>  in those sheep where cardiac arrhythmia was suspected during the physical examination. to document progressive pruritic behaviour, a scratch test score was calculated retrospectively. this was the number of consecutive positive responses  to  <dig> . inconclusive responses  <cit>  counted towards positive reactions if they occurred prior to a positive response because it was interpreted as early sign of pruritus consistent with the progressive nature of scrapie. thus, an inconclusive response followed by no scratch response on the subsequent examination or a positive scratch test that disappeared prior to culling did not count as consecutive positive response until culling because clinical signs were less likely to be associated with a progressive disease if they disappeared.

assessments were made blind without knowledge of the genotype or inoculum although the scrapie status was known once animals were mixed. sheep were euthanased with intravenous injection of secobarbital and cinchocaine  at clinical end-point, which was reached when animals displayed progressive abnormalities in sensation  and movement .

post-mortem investigation
the brain and a range of lymphoid tissues were taken and processed for immunohistochemistry  and western immunoblot  examination.

for ihc, tissue from the central nervous system  and lymphoid tissue were formalin-fixed, wax-embedded and examined with six different antibodies, which bind to different amino acid  residues of ovine prp: bg <dig> , 12b <dig> ,  <dig>  , 9a <dig> , bh <dig>  and r <dig>  and are used to distinguish classical scrapie from bovine spongiform encephalopathy  and ch1641-like strains  <cit> . the discriminatory ihc was applied to nine aa sheep, three each with the different polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  which had similar scrapie-associated prion protein  profiles and total amount of prpsc . a naturally infected classical scrapie sheep, a sheep orally challenged with bse brain homogenate and a sheep intracerebrally inoculated with ch <dig> brain homogenate were used as controls; all three controls were aall <dig>  the robustness of the discriminatory ihc has been previously demonstrated  <cit> .

lesion profiling was carried out as described previously  <cit> : tissue sections of the brain at seven levels were immunolabelled with antibody r <dig> for simplified scoring of prpsc on a scale from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in steps of  <dig>  and including  <dig>  for trace immunolabelling. five different prpsc patterns were distinguished: i) intraneuronal, ii) intraglial , iii) extracellular glia-associated , iv) grey matter neuropil-associated , and v) other types . the average value for each prpsc pattern from the seven areas examined was used to create an individual prpsc profile and, for grouping by genotype, the profiles constituted the mean of the individual sheep profiles within each genotype group.

wb examination for detection of the proteinase-resistant form of prpsc  was carried out on samples of the caudal medulla and medial retropharyngeal lymph node using antibodies sha <dig>  and p <dig> according to the biorad tesee universal wb protocol . parallel testing with the two specific monoclonal antibodies aids in the discrimination between classical bse and scrapie where sha <dig> detects prpres in both cattle and sheep, whereas p <dig> is more selective for scrapie prpres  <cit> . additional antibodies used were 12b <dig>  saf <dig>  and 9a <dig>  sigma biotinylated molecular mass markers as well as a known uk classical scrapie  brain sample, known uk bovine bse brain sample and known ovine vrq/vrq non-neural mesenteric lymph node sample  were included as positive controls for profile comparisons. all control samples were homogenates from a single naturally infected animal. all samples were tested once.

from each sample,  <dig>  g tissue was ribolysed, purified, treated with proteinase k  and prpres concentrated according to the kit instructions and with the reagents supplied. as four samples produced weak profiles upon initial examination of caudal medulla tissue, these samples were processed in duplicate and the pellets combined  for subsequent runs. samples were heated for 4 min at 100 °c prior to loading on gels. a sample of 15 μl each was loaded in duplicate lanes onto pre-cast 12% bis-tris gels  and electrophoresed for 50 min at 200 v. the proteins were then transferred onto pvdf membranes  and blocked  for 30 min at room temperature. they were probed with the kit primary antibody  for 30 min at room temperature and additional antibodies  for  <dig> h at room temperature.

the membranes were washed, incubated for 20 min in bio-rad secondary antibody  or goat anti-mouse conjugate  at room temperature, washed again and the membranes were incubated with ecl substrate  for 1 min. the signal was detected with the fluor-s multiimager .

the total amount of prpres signal emitted from the diglycosylated, monoglycosylated and unglycosylated protein bands was calculated by means of the volume analysis tool in the quantity one software  for antibodies sha <dig> and p <dig>  the global background was subtracted and the ratio for the ovine scrapie control sample set at 1; the ratio for the test samples was then calculated relative to the ovine scrapie control sample. the cut off was set at  <dig>  and any sample with a ratio below this was considered to be classical scrapie-like and any ratio above this was considered classical bse-like.

RESULTS
animal data, such as prnp genotype, sex and survival time, of the  <dig> sheep that developed a tse  are provided in table  <dig>  the influence of prnp genotype on survival time has already been discussed in the previous publication  <cit>  and will not be mentioned in this manuscript.

clinical signs
signs of pruritus, characterised by a stereotypical response to scratching of the back  and/ or alopecia with or without skin lesions suggestive of excessive rubbing, scratching or nibbling were displayed by all  <dig> sheep that were either vv or ll <dig> . of the four sheep with alopecia , one ll <dig> sheep did not display a clear stereotypical response when scratched although the scratch response had been positive at the examination three days earlier. scratch test scores ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   in vv sheep and  <dig> to  <dig>   in ll <dig> sheep. none of the lf <dig> or ff <dig> sheep displayed signs of pruritus and the scratch test score was  <dig> for all sheep with these polymorphisms. by contrast, the most frequent sign observed in lf <dig> or ff <dig> sheep was limb weakness  in combination with ataxia  whereas limb weakness was observed in only one ll <dig> sheep even though most of them  were ataxic . a head tremor was present in all six vv sheep but rare in aa sheep; other movement disorders were lip twitches  and spontaneous myoclonus . bruxism was audible in five of the six ll <dig> sheep and three of the six vv sheep but only in one ff <dig> sheep. infrequent signs were cardiac arrhythmia , lack of menace response , cataplexy-like collapse , inappetence , disequilibrium when blindfolded  and othaematoma . table  <dig> lists the percentage of animals per genotype group that displayed selected clinical signs. full details of the clinical signs are given in additional file 4: clinical and pathological data.fig.  <dig> electrocardiogram recorded from ll <dig> milk recipient  <dig> with cardiac arrhythmia. extract of an electrocardiogram recorded over 5 min prior to cull whilst the animal was restrained in its pen with other sheep; overall heart rate  <dig> beats per minute. r = r peak intervals; major unit on x axis is second, major unit on y axis is  <dig>  mv. note the irregular rhythm of the r peak intervals, which do not appear to follow a particular pattern

immunohistochemistry
fig.  <dig> shows the total magnitude of prpsc immunolabelling in the brain of each sheep, which reflects the sum of all average scores for the different prpsc patterns. whilst there was little variation between sheep with an lf <dig>  or ff <dig>  prnp genotype, more variation was seen in vv  and ll <dig> sheep  where the total brain prpsc score in one sheep could be more than double the score in another sheep irrespective of whether they were challenged with brain or milk from the same donors .fig.  <dig> total magnitude of brain prpsc in sheep of different genotypes. solid bars = milk recipients; patterned bars = brain recipients. colours identify goat donors . survival times are indicated on the top of each bar




the mean prpsc profiles of goat brain and milk recipients, separated by prnp genotype, are shown in fig.  <dig>  the profiles were similar in vv and ll <dig> sheep but differed from the profiles seen in lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep. when the prpsc profiles from individual sheep were compared within the prnp genotype group , differences were apparent between ll <dig> sheep fed milk from different donors but not between lf <dig> sheep, which all displayed similar profiles. also, challenge with brain from the same donor resulted in profile differences in vv sheep but not in ff <dig> sheep.fig.  <dig> mean prpsc profiles in the brains of goat brain and milk recipients sheep of different genotypes. itnr = intraneuronal, itgl = intraglial, glas = glia-associated, nrpl = neuropil-associated, othr = other types of prpsc immunolabelling. shown are the mean values with standard error of mean bars

discriminatory ihc using six different antibodies revealed that antibody detection in the different compartments in cns tissue of aa sheep was dependent on polymorphisms at codon  <dig> of the ovine prnp . in lymphoid tissue, all antibodies detected the same levels of prpsc in macrophages, which was consistent with classical scrapie.fig.  <dig> differences in prpsc localisation depending on codon  <dig> polymorphisms observed by discriminatory immunohistochemistry on brain tissue using six different antibodies. classical scrapie, classical ovine bse and the ch <dig> strain  are shown for comparison. shown are the mean values with standard error of mean bars. the diagram on the right represents the ovine prion protein and the binding sites of the antibodies used in this study

molecular profiles
molecular profiles obtained by wb testing of caudal medulla with antibodies sha <dig> and p <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  differences were seen in relation to the reactivity with the n-terminal antibody p <dig>  which was dependent on prnp polymorphisms at codon 141: prpres was detected with this antibody in vv and ll <dig> sheep, similar to the classical scrapie ovine and caprine control samples, whereas reactivity was reduced in lf <dig> sheep and greatly reduced or absent in ff <dig> sheep, similar to the classical bse control sample. similar observations were made with two further n-terminal antibodies, 12b <dig> and saf <dig>  the sha31/p <dig> antibody ratios were less than  <dig> for vv and ll <dig> sheep as seen with the classical scrapie control samples, but above  <dig> in lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep. in fact, the ratio was above  <dig> in  <dig> of  <dig> lf <dig> sheep and in all ff <dig> sheep . by contrast, wb reactivities to sha <dig> and p <dig> antibodies on medial retropharyngeal lymph node samples were similar for all sheep, regardless of the  <dig> polymorphism, and similar to the classical scrapie control samples.fig.  <dig> western immunoblot profile of brains from sheep challenged with caprine scrapie. lanes 1–6: vv sheep ; lanes 7–12: ll <dig> sheep ; lanes 13–19: lf <dig> sheep ; lanes 20–22: ff <dig> sheep . m: molecular mass markers; c: caprine classical scrapie ii142; b: classical bse; o: ovine classical scrapie . for better visualisation, lanes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and controls were cropped from the original blots, indicated by the white boundary lines, to create a composite image. reactivity with the n-terminal antibody p <dig> was reduced in lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep, which is unlike classical scrapie

discussion
although this study was originally carried out to investigate the transmission of scrapie via goat milk using sheep as recipients it has provided valuable information about the influence of the prnp genotype, particularly at codon  <dig>  on the clinical, pathological and molecular phenotype of goat scrapie in sheep. it has been demonstrated previously that polymorphisms at codon  <dig> may affect survival time and disease phenotype in sheep on cross-prnp genotype inoculations with pooled sheep brain homogenate  <cit> .

clinically affected sheep presented with a range of clinical signs, which have been reported previously in sheep with scrapie and indicated that caprine scrapie transmitted to sheep produced a clinical disease associated with scrapie in sheep. this included less common signs such as cardiac arrhythmia, cataplexy-like collapse and othaematoma, possibly as a result of excessive pruritus, which have nevertheless been reported in natural scrapie in sheep . other involuntary movements, such as myoclonus  have been reported in some cases of scrapie  <cit>  but are usually more frequent in bse in cattle or creutzfeldt-jakob disease in humans and often in response to an external stimulus  .

clinical disease in sheep may vary according to breed, region and country, presenting either as pruritic or non-pruritic form  <cit> . the results presented here clearly demonstrate that the clinical phenotype is affected by prnp genotype, notably polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  of sheep of the same breed. all ll <dig> sheep  exhibited the pruritic form, which is also the predominant form in sheep infected with the bse agent and characterised by a positive scratch test , excessive rubbing and scratching resulting in wool loss  <cit> . by contrast, lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep presented with the nervous form, characterised by ataxia and limb weakness without any signs of pruritus, regardless of donor goat, which is clinically unlike experimental bse in sheep. these results provided further evidence that the clinical presentation is dependent on the prnp genotype as suggested by studies in naturally infected sheep where strain as confounding factor could not be excluded  <cit> .

the results also provided further evidence that the pathological phenotype was influenced by the prnp genotype at codon  <dig>  prpsc profiling by genotype revealed that the profiles did not differ between lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep, which was characterised by the predominance of intraneuronal and intraglial prpsc and an absence of extracellular glia-associated prpsc, which was in contrast to ll <dig> sheep  where glia-associated prpsc was more prominent . these findings were consistent with results from studies in naturally infected sheep or sheep with scrapie induced by experimental cross-genotype transmission, which suggested that prpsc profiles were influenced by prnp genotypes although other factors, such as source of infection and survival time could also be contributory  <cit> .

there is evidence from studies in experimentally and naturally infected sheep with scrapie that there is poor association between the severity of clinical signs and the level of prpres  <cit>  or prpsc in the brain . this was confirmed in the present study, using an established prpsc profiling method and detailed and regular clinical examinations for signs of scrapie. if the large variation in the total magnitude of prpsc immunolabelling in some vv and ll <dig> sheep was due to the difference in survival times and the severity of clinical signs despite having been infected with identical volumes of milk or doses of brain from the same donor, sheep with lower total prpsc scores should have shorter survival times with less severe clinical signs. however, this was not consistently observed. for example, the survival time was not necessarily longer in sheep with a higher prpsc score . studies on the clinical progression in naturally affected sheep with scrapie suggested that head tremor, ataxia, teeth grinding, loss of body condition and loss of a menace response occurred more frequently with disease progression  <cit> . there was some indication that sheep with higher prpsc scores, which had been challenged with milk or brain from the same donor, presented with more severe clinical signs: both brain-challenged vv sheep with a lower prpsc score  were not ataxic and had a menace response unlike the other vv sheep , which was ataxic, lost the menace response and had a considerably higher prpsc score. similarly, the severity of ataxia was considered less in an ll <dig> sheep with low prpsc score  compared to one with a high prpsc score , which also lost its appetite. however, two other vv sheep had almost identical signs  despite considerable total prpsc score differences and whilst one  was also teeth grinding, the other  displayed signs of disequilibrium, which suggested more severe gait abnormalities.

the differences in the prpsc profiles in ll <dig> sheep challenged with milk from different donors may be the results of possible strain differences although it does not explain why the same phenomenon was not observed in lf <dig> sheep unless the wild-type alleles  produce greater phenotypic variability.

similarly, the differences in the prpsc profiles in vv and ll <dig> sheep challenged with brain and milk from the same goat respectively may be to some extent explained by the different survival time and clinical severity of the sheep, which may alter the proportional localisation of prpsc immunolabelling so that sheep with longer survival times and more severe clinical signs have proportionally more intraneuronal and intraglial and less glia-associated immunolabelling, possibly as a result of progressive removal and internalization of glia-associated prpsc as the disease progresses . however, this does not quite explain the profile differences seen in vv sheep where the profiles were similar in sheep with the shortest and longest survival time . it also does not explain why lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep with comparatively longer survival times than ll <dig> sheep accumulate most prpsc intracellularly and lack glia-associated prpsc, which suggests that prpsc is more prone to be internalized in neurons and not deposited in the membrane of glial cells in sheep carrying the f <dig> allele.

discriminatory ihc using six different antibodies with different affinity to prpsc sequences is based on the observation that truncation of the prion protein of different strains  is dependent on tissue, cell type and location within the tissue . extracellular prpsc, which is not truncated, should be detected similarly with all antibodies whereas intracellular prpsc is truncated and therefore some antibodies  should detect it while others  may not. whilst discriminatory ihc applied to lymphoid tissue agreed with the molecular profile obtained from lymphoid tissue, which identified the samples as consistent with classical scrapie, tests applied to cns tissue produced a more varied result, which was dependent on prnp polymorphisms at codon  <dig>  this particularly affected the detection by n-terminal antibodies, such as 12b <dig> or p <dig>  the magnitude of prpsc immunolabelling with the 12b <dig> antibody was reduced in sheep carrying the f <dig> allele compared to ll <dig> sheep, which was particularly striking for extracellular and intraglial prpsc. similarly, p <dig> antibody reactivity in the wb was reduced in brains from lf <dig> and particularly ff <dig> sheep. this antibody is used for the discriminatory wb to distinguish classical scrapie from bse because brains from classical bovine bse and experimental classical ovine bse cases show no and greatly reduced signal, respectively  <cit> . ll <dig> sheep, including vv sheep, were classified as classical scrapie because prpres was detected with antibody p <dig>  and the sha31/p <dig> antibody ratio was as expected for classical scrapie isolates, whereas lf <dig> sheep produced an intermediate bse-like profile with reduced detection with p <dig>  and ff <dig> sheep produced a bse-like profile with little or no prpres detection with p <dig> and the sha31/p <dig> antibody ratio was unlike classical scrapie for both genotypes.

the results obtained from the discriminatory tests suggested that proteinase k used for wb cleaves brain samples from sheep with the l <dig> allotype towards the n terminus from the p <dig> epitope, thus resulting in prpres detection by both sha <dig> and p <dig>  in contrast, proteinase k appeared to cleave the f <dig> prp protein towards the c terminus from the p <dig> epitope, possibly around the  <dig> position, thus resulting in detection by sha <dig>  but not by p <dig> . as a consequence, in lf <dig> sheep the p <dig> antibody only detects the l <dig> but not the f <dig> allotype resulting in decreased signal and in ff <dig> sheep all prion protein is of the f <dig> allotype and therefore there is almost no prpres signal with p <dig>  the discriminatory ihc detected intraneuronal and intraglial prpsc with antibodies 12b <dig> and  <dig>  in lf <dig> and ff <dig> sheep, which was unlike bse, although the amount detected is lower by comparison with r <dig> and such a decrease was not seen in ll <dig> sheep. this suggests some cleavage of f <dig> allotype prpsc by cellular enzymes but such cleavage is not as drastic as with proteinase k seen in the wb. the decrease in intracellular prpsc immunolabelling with n terminal antibodies, which was higher in lf <dig> than ff <dig> sheep, remains unexplained unless some sort of interaction between the two allotypes makes the protein more susceptible to digestion.

the wb results highlight the difficulty in interpreting the discriminatory wb by examination of brain in cross-species transmission experiments because lf <dig> and particularly ff <dig> sheep demonstrated a classical bse-like profile, even though there was sufficient evidence that the isolate was not bse: i) ll <dig> sheep challenged with the same isolate produced a profile consistent with classical scrapie; ii) testing of lymphoid tissue produced a molecular and pathological phenotype consistent with classical scrapie; iii) the discriminatory ihc was unlike bse and iv) the lack of pruritus in lf <dig> and ff <dig> was inconsistent with the clinical phenotype reported for classical bse in sheep  <cit> . there is currently no evidence that this poses a problem for potential misdiagnosis during discriminatory testing of positive small ruminant field cases in accordance with current european union legislation if similar cross-species transmission occurred naturally but the process of referral for a case giving an initial bse-like characteristic initiates further investigative testing that would rule out bse.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provided evidence that the clinical, pathological and molecular phenotype of classical scrapie transmitted from goats to sheep is affected by prnp polymorphisms, particularly at codon  <dig>  which has to be taken into account when investigating strain characteristics by laboratory methods.
