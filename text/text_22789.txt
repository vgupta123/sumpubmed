BACKGROUND
epigenetic mechanisms, such as dna methylation, have been suggested as possible causal pathways linking environmental exposure to disease. many of these studies depend on the epigenome-wide analysis of prospectively collected samples, in the context of large human cohorts. as epigenome-wide technologies are becoming available, the use of such cohort studies will provide large amounts of information in the coming years. due to the general lack of biospecimen collection in observational human studies, many of these cohorts rely on the use of dried blood spots  obtained soon after birth as the main source of biological information  <cit> .

the use of filter paper for blood collection and analysis was implemented as early as the 1960s by guthrie et al. using dried-blood samples for newborn phenylketonuria detection  <cit> . “guthrie cards” are widely used in many types of tests, including chemical, serological, and genetic applications  <cit> . more recently, flinders technology associates chemically treated filter papers  were specifically developed for dna/rna analyses  <cit> . these chemically treated cards allow long-term storage of dna at room temperature and are impregnated with denaturants that guard against oxidation, nuclease and ultraviolet damage, and both bacterial and fungal degradation.

neonatal dbs are routinely collected in many countries and represent a cost-effective tool to store precious biological specimens for subsequent studies. however, reliable profiling the dna methylome in dbs has proven to be technically challenging, particularly because such techniques require stringent bisulfite preprocessing that can degrade dna  <cit> . other limitations of their use include the variable degradation of dna due to storage and extraction, the usually small amounts of dna that can be obtained , and the identification of technical artifacts potentially associated with long term storage  <cit> .

recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of dbs in dna methylome analyses, using methylated dna immunoprecipitaion combined with sequencing   <cit> , methyl-cpg binding domain  protein-enrichment combined with sequencing   <cit> , and infinium  bead arrays  <cit> . the last version of illumina’s bead array, infinium humanmethylation <dig>  beadchip, is cost-effective, requires dna amounts as low as 300 ng, enables the detection and quantitation of dna methylation levels at  <dig>  cpg sites across the genome and represents one of the most comprehensive microarray methods to date for investigating the methylome  <cit> . three reports have addressed the utility of hm <dig> on dbs  <cit> . the first report validated the use and the high correlation between two different methylomic platforms on dbs dna: hm <dig> and medip-seq  <cit> . the second one generated good quality methylome-wide data from dbs, as compared to their matched frozen buffy coat  <cit> . the third one used dbs-based hm <dig> analyses to study the epigenetic effects of gestational age, as recently demonstrated by our group  <cit> . however, none of these studies analyzed methods for optimized dna extraction and quality verification from dbs, both of which represent major upstream steps in the pipeline for dbs-based research, including epigenetics.

in this report, we tested and developed a range of dna extraction methods from neonatal fta cards, individually or in combinations. we incorporated or modified protocol steps that were crucial to increase the dna yield and quality from dbs, and additionally tested their efficiency on guthrie cards. moreover, we suggest an optimal protocol for both, pyrosequencing- and hm450-based, methylation studies. this work could prove useful in meeting the increased demand for research on prenatal origins of human diseases and for newborn screening programs.

RESULTS
optimization of phases i and ii in the dna extraction protocols
limited quantity and quality are important drawbacks in the use of dna obtained from dbs, particularly for epigenome-wide studies. initially, we ruled out the possibility of using whole bisulfitome amplification  after confirming the introduction of biases, mostly in the middle range of dna methylation levels , further confirming the recently reported finding by bundo et al.  <cit> . then, to systematically optimize dna extraction from dbs, we divided the different steps of this process into two phases . critical steps in phase i included blood extraction off the filter papers, cell lysis and protease digestion . phase ii included dna precipitation, purification and elution .

we have previously tested several genomic dna extraction methods on dbs, including resin-based, lysis-based and magnetic bead-based  <cit> . lysis- and bead-based methods were the best, but the latter is not suitable for beadchip methylation profiling, so it was not considered in this study  <cit> . among lysis-based methods, several commercially available kits, including qiaamp dna micro kit, gensolve and nucleospin, have been shown to be efficient for dbs dna extraction  <cit> . therefore, we selected these three kits to optimize the two phases of dna extraction. this optimization involved the combination of the different kits and modifications in several steps of the two protocol phases  . a combination of gensolve reagents in phase i and qiaamp reagents in phase ii  was set as a reference protocol to which other tested methods were compared . in all pairwise comparisons, two dbs punches from the same dbs were used, and assessment of quantity and quality were initially done using nanodrop  . these dbs were obtained from the national children study , usa, and were fta-type, which preserves well dna relative to other types of neonatal cards , hence, allowing comparisons across a wide range of dna extraction protocols.

two punches, each having 9 mm diameter, were analyzed per dbs. punches labeled “a” were tested with gq while their matched pairs, labeled “b”, were tested with qq or qq. when the dna precipitation buffer in qq was changed to ethanol, the resultant protocol was termed qq. average eluate volume by gq, qq or qq was 42 μl. data represent averages of 2– <dig> readings per sample.

the gq protocol is set as the reference protocol above all the other protocols to which it is compared. the dna quantity or quality parameters of the other protocols are described always in comparison to gq. dna yields of qq were significantly lower than gq , those of qq, gn, gn, nn and nn were significantly higher than gq , and those of gn-xs, gn-xs and nn-xs were not different from gq , as compared by paired t-test. for each dna parameter described, the counts of hits over the total number of dbs analyzed for that parameter are indicated between parentheses. table cells highlighted in bold represent protocol performance that is at least as good as that of gq.

aquantities showing less than 20% change from gq were considered ‘similar’ to gq. this threshold exceeds the  <dig> % average increase in dna quantities observed between gq technical replicates, with an average coefficient of variation of  <dig> % .

bin protocol pairwise comparisons, 260/ <dig> ratios that were considered ‘similar’ were either both within the optimal  <dig> - <dig>  range or both outside this range. otherwise, the ratio outside the  <dig> - <dig>  range was considered ‘worse’ relative to that within.

c‘lower’ and ‘higher’ indicate 260/ <dig> ratio differences of at least  <dig>  absorbance units below or above gq ratios, respectively; otherwise, ratios were considered ‘similar’. the following guidelines were adopted for the 260/ <dig> ratio: optimal and indicating pure dna if higher than  <dig> , acceptable if between  <dig> - <dig> , and tolerated if between  <dig> - <dig>  .

ddna integrity refers to dna size range and level of degradation, as assessed by gel electrophoresis. ten samples were also reassessed by bioanalyzer, showing similar relative comparisons to gq. every dbs, in which both punches of the tested protocol pairs exhibited high dna degradation , was excluded from the pairwise comparisons of protocols.

ena: not applicable due to limited quantities of extractable dna.

dna yield and quality were consistently better for the reference gq protocol when compared to qiagen protocol  . although dna yield was drastically increased when ethanol was used in the qiagen precipitation step , dna quality was still suboptimal compared to gq, as assessed by nanodrop . in contrast, the combination of gensolve and nucleospin  increased the dna yield while preserving dna quality, regardless of the use of ethanol in the precipitation step . a similar improvement was observed when using nucleospin kit in both phases of dna extraction  . the extra-small  versions of nucleospin, with column designs specific for low elution volumes, did not consistently improve dna quantity or quality, whether combined or not with other kits , the dna precipitation buffer changed to ethanol, or the washing volume and frequency increased .

cross-comparisons across the different tested dna extraction protocols
dna quality parameters assessed earlier were based on dna 260/ <dig> and 260/ <dig> spectrophotometric ratios. two other important quality parameters are dna detectability by pcr and dna integrity and size range, which can be assessed by gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analyses. dna from all tested protocols exhibited detectable pcr bands of a housekeeping gene, gapdh , hence indicating that the dna is amplifiable for specific short regions. dna isolated by the gq method exhibited a smear-like profile by gel electrophoresis, with peak intensity often greater than  <dig> kilo base pair  . bioanalyzer smear analyses confirmed the dna average size peak to be greater than  <dig> kbp, with an average size ranging across samples between  <dig> - <dig>  kbp . compared to gq, all tested protocols often showed more dna degradation, except for protocol qq which usually exhibited similar dna smear profiles .

overall comparison of the tested dna quantity and quality parameters across the protocols shows that the best two protocols that at least match gq in most of the tested parameters are qq and nn  . relative to gq, the only drawback of qq is its 260/ <dig> dna ratios . qq 260/ <dig> ratios were always out of range, indicating that the high qq dna quantity measurements recorded spectrophotometrically by nanodrop may not be accurate. however, quantification with qubit, a fluorescent-based method, confirmed the yield in qq to be  <dig> × higher than in gq . the only drawback of nn  relative to gq was dna integrity, with the dna size ranges in nn or nn being lower than in gq .

in conclusion, protocol gq seems to be the most robust among the tested methods across all tested dna quantity and quality parameters. qq can be rather suitable for applications requiring larger dna quantities from dbs, while maintaining large fragment sizes, but in which 260/ <dig> ratios are not a necessity. on the other hand, protocols nn or nn may be better suitable for applications requiring larger dna quantities from dbs, relative to gq, while maintaining optimal 260/ <dig> and better 260/ <dig> ratios, but in which large dna fragment sizes are not a requirement.

of note, when gq was tested on dbs  from the tasmanian infant health survey , australia, dating more than 20 years old, an average of 66 ± 15 ng  of dna could be extracted per two punches, each being 1 mm in diameter, with a mean 260/ <dig> ratio of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; these dna quantities are equivalent to  <dig>  ng/mm <dig> for tihs, compared to  <dig>  ng/mm <dig> for ncs samples.

performance of dna extracted from dbs using methylome-wide analysis
methylation probe call index
in order to assess the performance of dna extracted from dbs in hm <dig> methylome-wide analyses, we used the dna extracted by gq, being the most robust protocol. dna from two sample pairs, each representing two punches  from the same dbs, were analyzed by hm <dig>  in addition, dbs pairs were compared to reference dna from neonatal blood or cell lines . in all tested samples, whether originating from neonatal blood, dbs or cell lines, more than 99% of the  <dig>  hm <dig> individual probes were detected, using the commonly accepted quality control detection p-value of  <dig> , hence, indicating high quality data. the average beta-values were similar between the technical replicates ncs 37a and 37b  and between the technical replicates ncs 38a and 38b  .

three sources of dna are used in hm <dig> array: neonatal blood , dbs and cell lines. nb and cell line dna is of good genomic quality and serves as technical reference. nb provides dna from the same tissue origin as dbs, being blood. the cell line dna is of hepatic origin. the technical pairs are represented by two punches from each of two blood spots and are labeled as ‘ncs 37a and 37b’ and ‘ncs 38a and 38b’, respectively. probe p-value was set to  <dig> . the percentage of detected probes  represents the proportion out of the total of  <dig>  probes on the hm <dig> array. the average, minimum and maximum beta-values with detection p <  <dig>  are shown .

sample–dependent and –independent hm <dig> internal quality control probes
for sample and array quality, hm <dig> array includes  <dig> quality control  probes. fifteen qc probes are sample-independent and  <dig> qc probes are sample-dependent  <cit> . dna from dbs, neonatal blood or cell lines passed the described hm <dig> qc . background probes, wherever included, produced minimal signal , and the intended positive signals from the experimental qc probes were above background, for all of the three tested dna sources . in addition, performance of dbs samples was similar to that of subsets taken from reference neonatal blood and cell line samples . bisulfite conversion efficiency for both, type i and ii probes, was high for all tested samples  and was confirmed by pcr using primers that are specific either to bisulfite converted or to non-modified gapdh dna regions .

differential methylation and clustering analyses using hm <dig> data
differential methylation of hm <dig> beta-values produced two major clusters . cell line dna samples formed one cluster while dbs and neonatal blood dna formed another; this is expected because the cell lines used are of hepatic tissue origin while both, dbs and neonatal blood samples, are of blood tissue origin. within the cluster of blood biospecimens, all four neonatal blood samples formed one sub-cluster, which was segregated away from the dbs sub-cluster. the two punches ncs 37a and 37b, representing the technical replicates from the same spot ncs  <dig>  clustered together and away from the other two technical replicates, ncs 38a and 38b, which also clustered together . this further supports the observed higher correlations  between technical duplicates punched from the same dbs  versus different dbs . when the analysis was limited to the top 1% of probes that showed the highest variance in m-values  across any of the four tested dbs, ncs_37a, ncs_37b, ncs_38a and ncs_38b, the correlation between replicates  become significantly higher and more predictive of replication  than the correlation between non-replicates  . similar observations were reported using spearman correlations. moreover, the frequency distributions of delta m-values  between samples were centred at zero only between technical replicates . hence, we can conclude that hm <dig> analyses using dbs dna, extracted using the gq protocol, is reproducible.

performance of dna extracted from dbs using sequence-specific methylation analysis
the performance of dna extracted from dbs by the gq method was then tested using sequence-specific methylation analyses. for this purpose, we analyzed the methylation levels of several cpg sites in line <dig> and aluyb <dig> sequences, both of which are proxy markers of global methylation, being transposable elements interspersed across the genome  <cit> . the technical replicates, ncs 37a and 37b, showed similar line <dig> and aluyb <dig> methylation levels at each tested cpg site, and similar data were observed with the pair, ncs 38a and 38b . these results show that inter-replicate variation in methylation levels is minimal using several cpg sites in two different loci, line <dig> and aluyb <dig>  moreover, the observed difference in methylation levels between the pair ncs 37a and 37b versus ncs 38a and 38b was consistent at every single cpg tested and across both, line <dig> and aluyb <dig> loci  . these results confirm that dna extracted from dbs using gq is suitable to detect small methylation differences in a consistent manner and with low inter-replicate variation.

discussion
dbs have become an increasingly important tool for diagnostic purposes and for epigenetic, genetic and epidemiological research. we have previously tested a range of commercially available dna extraction kits for purifying genomic dna from fresh and dried blood for downstream pcr and dna methylation applications  <cit> . we found that genomic dna extraction, using the chargeswitch forensic dna purification kit , with subsequent bisulfite modification, using the methyleasy kit , was best in yielding bisulfite-converted dna of sufficient quantity and quality for downstream candidate-gene dna methylation analyses, such as sequenom massarray epityper analysis  <cit> . however, dna extraction with chargeswitch was recently shown to be not suitable for beadchip methylation profiling, leading to up to 16% loss of detectable probes in infinum humanmethylation <dig>  arrays analysis  <cit> . in relation to the limited amounts of dna extracted from dbs, a recent report also pointed to the biases introduced by whole bisulfitome amplification and the need for careful data interpretation  <cit> , as we have also observed in this study.

in this work, we have systematically compared different dna extraction methods from dbs by dissecting different phases of extraction and optimizing several steps within each phase, using commercial and in-house extraction protocols. for these purposes, we used a homogenous set of dbs samples, spotted on the same day and stored in a similar manner, to provide a common platform for cross-protocol comparisons. moreover, this study emphasizes dna extraction protocols that have particular utility in a recent technology for studying methylome-wide methylation, infinium hm <dig>  and sequence-specific methylation, by pyrosequencing. the use of dbs for diagnostic and research purposes is not new, but there is a lack of quality standards for optimizing dna extraction. this study suggests different dna extraction protocols, each having specific advantages tailored for specific applications. protocol gq does not extract the highest dna yield, but provides dna in quantities and qualities sufficient for hm <dig> methylome-wide and sequence-specific methylation analyses. with gq, the 260/ <dig> ratios are consistently optimal and the extracted dna is less fragmented relative to other protocols. protocol qq, on the other hand, produces twice as much dna as gq and with similar dna integrity. however, 260/ <dig> ratios in qq are unreliable and cannot be used for sample selection, particularly for expensive downstream applications. as for protocols nn or nn, they extract  <dig>  folds more dna than gq and show optimal ranges for both, 260/ <dig> and 260/ <dig> ratios. however, these protocols lead to more dna fragmentation relative to gq. this may represent a limitation for bead array-based assays and other dna methylation assays where dna integrity is a requirement. it should be noted though that 260/ <dig> and 260/ <dig> ratios should be treated with caution; for example, different contaminants can compensate for each other’s’ deviations, resulting in misleading optimal 260/ <dig> ratios.

because the type of purification column was identical in gq and qq, but different from those used in all the other methods, column nature  could be the reason for the better dna integrity in the two protocols. this is further supported by our results showing that in gq, changing phase ii  while maintaining phase i, as in gn/n or gn/n-xs, compromises dna integrity . changing the dna precipitation buffer to ethanol reduces the need in some protocols to vigorously vortex to dissolve resultant precipitates but does not seem to enhance dna integrity . however, ethanol, as a precipitating buffer, was essential in some protocols to increase the dna yield, as in qq versus qq .

other studies have compared dna extraction protocols from dbs, but irrespective of epigenetic applications  <cit> . it is difficult to compare dna extraction protocols across different studies due to many reasons, such as differences in the structures of filter papers on which blood was soaked, the storage conditions and year-durations, and dna quantifications methods used. however, these studies used qiaamp dna mini kit  as a reference method, which is similar to the qq protocol in this work, hence, allowing comparisons between our and their optimized methods. sjoholm et al. reported that qiaamp dna mini kit performed the best relative to ezna , chelex  <dig>  and alkaline lysis   <cit> . on the other hand, the in-house developed dna extraction methods reported by hue et al. and hollegaard et al. yielded, by nanodrop quantification,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold more dna, respectively than qiaamp dna mini kit  <cit> . in comparison, the gq protocol in our study yielded, also by nanodrop quantification, on average  <dig>  fold more dna than matched qq samples; in addition, protocols qq, nn and nn yielded at least  <dig>  folds more dna than matched gq samples. moreover, the in-house protocol by hue et al. produced a low purity 260/ <dig> average ratio   <cit> , while gq, nn and nn ratios were optimal in every tested sample. these findings support the good performance of our optimized methods relative to many other in-house and commercial dna extraction protocols from dbs. interestingly, one study reported a recent method suitable for performing scalable dna extractions simultaneously from many dbs, but with less emphasis on dna quality and yield comparisons across different methods  <cit> . the scale of our tested methods can be increased by implementing the qiacube technology , and, with scalable designs, laser cutting of dbs punches would eliminate cross-contamination, as has been recently reported  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study arises from an international effort across several cohorts and working groups aiming to fulfill the need to systematize quality standards in dna extraction and to increase the dna yield using dbs, particularly with the advent of high-throughput epigenomic technology that require high quality and quantity of dna. given the emerging appreciation of dbs collected at birth as a valuable resource for epigenetic analyses prior to phenotypic onset, our optimized methods for dna extraction with application in methylation analyses have great potential for diagnostic and research purposes.
