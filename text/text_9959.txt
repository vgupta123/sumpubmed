BACKGROUND
during vertebrate evolution, there has been a distinct switch from a strong hormonal influence on sex determination to a genetic switch mechanism. in nonmammalian vertebrates, oestrogen administration to male embryos, or blocking oestrogen production in female embryos, results in sex reversal  <cit> . in contrast, in mice, oestrogen does not affect the early development of either ovaries or testes, and in its absence, gonadal development proceeds normally until after birth  <cit> . although the role of oestrogen in determining gonadal fate differs between vertebrates, the downstream pathways of gonadal differentiation are highly conserved. in particular, sox <dig>  the key regulator of testicular differentiation, appears to have similar functions in all vertebrates  <cit> , starting with cytoplasmic expression in the indifferent gonad, but translocating to the nucleus in males to activate the testicular pathway  <cit> . in oestrogen-deficient female mice , germ cells are gradually lost from pubertal ovaries concomitant with remodeling of the somatic tissue. there is also transdifferentiation of the ovarian granulosa cells to form testicular sertoli-like cells that express sox <dig> and align in structures resembling testicular cords  <cit> . this phenotype can be reversed by administration of oestrogen, causing the somatic cells to reform granulosa cells and resulting in an ovarian architecture and suppression of sox <dig>  <cit> . these data show that although oestrogen is not required for early ovarian development in mice, it is critical for maintaining ovarian somatic cell fate in the differentiated gonad.

how and why oestrogen became dissociated from sex determination in mammals is unknown. a genetically controlled sex determination mechanism may have evolved in mammals to protect the young developing in utero from the effect of large quantities of oestrogen in the fetoplacental unit  <cit> . however, oestrogen receptor expression is maintained in the indifferent mammalian gonad  <cit>  despite their apparent lack of function, and exposure of gonads to exogenous oestrogen activates the translocation of the receptors to the nuclei of indifferent gonadal cells  <cit> . not surprisingly, the mammalian placenta is highly effective in metabolizing hormones before they reach the developing fetus  <cit> , protecting it from maternal influences. marsupial mammals are born with undifferentiated gonads that undergo gonadal sex determination postnatally  <cit> , allowing daily administration of oestrogen directly to developing male young from before the testis pathway is initiated. oestrogen treatment of xy young in the opossum and in the tammar wallaby directs the development of the indifferent gonads towards an ovarian differentiation fate  <cit> , including entry of the xy germ cells into meiosis, despite the presence of a y-chromosome and sry  <cit> .

the sex-reversing effects of exogenous oestrogen on the marsupial xy gonad are time-dependent  <cit> , just as there is a critical time window of sry action in the mouse  <cit> . complete ovarian formation with germ cells arrested in meiosis was seen only in animals that were born about  <dig> day prematurely in a  <dig> -day pregnancy in the tammar  <cit>  and one half to  <dig> day prematurely in the  <dig> -day gestation in the opossum  <cit> . treatment of animals born after a full-term pregnancy with the same dose of oestrogen did not affect testicular development and resulted in only minor disruption of the testis in both species  <cit> .

these findings suggest that there is a critical point in development when the xy gonad becomes irreversibly committed to a testicular fate. in the tammar, this coincides with the first morphological signs of sertoli cell development and seminiferous cord formation, which occurs after birth from a normal full-term pregnancy  <cit> . to promote ovarian development, oestrogen must be administered before the somatic cell lineage has initiated sertoli cell development. early experiments treating opossums with large amounts of androgens did not affect gonadal development of male or female young  <cit> . similarly, in the tammar, testosterone administration to male pouch young had no visible effect on testicular structure, although oestrogen given after testes development was initiated did cause a small degree of testicular dysgenesis  <cit> . identical findings have also been reported in nonmammalian vertebrates in which administration of oestrogen to the indifferent gonad can actively induce ovarian development, independent of genetic or environmental sex-determining factors  <cit> , whereas exogenous androgen treatment does not affect testicular development  <cit> . the effects of oestrogen are mediated through the oestrogen receptors  in the gonad  <cit> . treatment of the tammar xy gonads at day  <dig> of gestation with oestrogen in culture causes the oestrogen receptors to move from a cytoplasmic to nuclear localization within the cell, consistent with their activation and ability to affect gene transcription in an oestrogen-dependent manner  <cit> . the nuclear translocation of both receptor proteins in the presence of exogenous oestrogen in culture confirms the ability of the receptors to respond functionally to the ligand, even at early developmental stages  <cit> . thus the observed effects of exogenous oestrogen are oestrogen-, and not steroid-, specific.

the genes controlling sex determination are conserved between eutherian and marsupial mammals. sry and sox <dig> are expressed in the developing sertoli cells of the xy eutherian and marsupial testis  <cit> . these cells direct the development of the testicular architecture and secrete amh, a hormone necessary for the regression of the müllerian ducts  <cit> . in the absence of sry in developing xx gonads, sox <dig> levels are significantly lower  <cit> , amh is not activated and the müllerian ducts remain intact  <cit> . fgf <dig> may also be important for sertoli cell specification  <cit>  and shares an antagonistic relationship with an ovarian differentiation gene, wnt <dig>  <cit> . other key ovarian development genes include foxl <dig>  rspo <dig> and fst, which are upregulated in the somatic cells of the early developing ovary in mice and humans  <cit> . disruption of each gene dramatically affects ovarian differentiation and can lead to varying degrees of testicular development in xx mammals  <cit> .

to determine the molecular changes occurring during oestrogen -induced sex reversal of xy gonads, we investigated the expression of key male and female differentiation factors  in our model marsupial, the tammar wallaby, during the critical period of gonadal differentiation and after oestrogen-induced sex reversal. here we show that exposure of the indifferent xy gonad to oestrogen resulted in suppression of sry and amh and upregulation of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  thus diverting the male developmental pathway into the female one. the sox <dig> gene was not downregulated by oestrogen exposure during xy ovarian development, but sox <dig> protein was prevented from entering the nucleus of the supporting cells in the presence of oestrogen and therefore could not activate the male developmental program. we hypothesise that this novel function of oestrogen in modulating the nucleocytoplasmic localization of sox <dig> may reflect an ancestral primordial mechanism by which oestrogen mediates sex determination in nonmammalian development. however, oestrogen retains an important function in adult female mammals by maintaining granulosa cell fate in the differentiated ovary by suppressing nuclear localization of the sox <dig> protein.

RESULTS
molecular development of the marsupial gonad mirrors that of the eutherian gonad
we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction  to examine the normal expression profiles of key male and female gonadal differentiation genes during early testicular and ovarian development from day  <dig> of gestation  through day  <dig> postpartum in the tammar wallaby . the molecular control of testicular development in the developing tammar was similar to that of the mouse and human, except that the first signs of sexually dimorphic expression of sox <dig> and amh preceded the peak in sry expression and testicular differentiation. sry  expression increased from day  <dig> of gestation  in xy gonads and reached a peak at day  <dig> postpartum  around the time of testicular cord formation. sry levels then fell sharply as in the mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit> . in tammar males, sox <dig>  rose in the gonad, initially in concert with sry, but continued to increase after sry expression fell, consistent with its suggested autoregulation  <cit> . sox <dig> was significantly higher in males than in females from day  <dig> of gestation , 4- <dig> days before the onset of testis cord formation, consistent with its activation by sry binding to the conserved testis-specific enhancer element tesco in the sox <dig> promoter, that is found in marsupials as well as in eutherians  <cit> . in female gonads, sox <dig> levels declined relative to levels in the testes, presumably due to the absence of sry. sox <dig> levels were lowest in females at day 1- <dig> pp  and remained consistently lower in the ovary throughout development. amh expression  was identical at day  <dig> of gestation in xx and xy gonads, but became significantly lower in ovaries  by day  <dig> of gestation, the day of birth. the sexual dimorphism in amh expression is consistent with reduced sox <dig> expression in xx compared to xy gonads by day  <dig> of gestation . amh levels remained significantly lower in ovaries than in testes throughout the period of development examined. fgf <dig> expression  was unexpectedly higher in females than in males during very early testis cord formation  but reached peak expression above that seen in the ovary by day  <dig> pp . this is concomitant with a drop in wnt <dig> expression at this stage , further supporting an antagonistic interaction between these two genes in the gonad  <cit> . foxl <dig>  was significantly lower in males than in females over the entire period examined , consistent with expression seen in the developing mouse gonads  <cit> , which suggests a conserved early role for this gene in mammalian ovarian development. fst expression  was not significantly lower in developing testes than in ovaries during early development but became significantly upregulated in developing ovaries after day  <dig> pp  during the time of ovarian differentiation. rspo <dig>  was not significantly lower in males than in females during early gonadal development. however, on day  <dig> pp, rspo <dig> levels dropped in females and were significantly higher in males . after day  <dig> pp, levels dropped in males and increased in females during the key window of ovarian differentiation. wnt <dig> expression  was generally higher in females than in males but this was only significant after day  <dig> pp, again during the time of active ovarian differentiation, as seen for fst and rspo <dig>  p values were significantly different at almost all time points for foxl <dig>  fst, amh and sox <dig> .

exogenous oestrogen causes development of ovarian structures in xy gonads
to verify that exogenous oestrogen would cause gonadal sex reversal in culture as it does in vitro  <cit> , we examined the histological organization of the gonads from two control and two oestrogen-treated xy gonads after incubation in either control or oestrogen-supplemented media. gonads were collected at day  <dig> of gestation, just before gonadal sex determination and birth. gonads placed in control media and grown for  <dig> days had normal testicular architecture with the formation of seminiferous cords lined with sertoli cells, encapsulating the germ cells . conversely, xy gonads cultured in the presence of oestrogen did not develop testicular cords and instead the gonads took on an ovarian appearance, with the formation of a clear demarcation between the cortex and medulla .

exogenous oestrogen has a dramatic effect on the testicular differentiation pathway
we next investigated the effect of sex reversal on the expression of key testicular genes in  <dig> pairs of null control and oestrogen-treated xy gonadal cultures by quantitative pcr. in the control gonads, the levels of sry, sox <dig> and amh were comparable to those in vivo, demonstrating that the gonads developed normally in culture. however, the mrna levels of both sry  and amh  were significantly reduced in xy gonads cultured in the presence of oestrogen . fgf <dig> levels were also suppressed in oestrogen-treated gonads, although levels were not significant . in contrast, sox <dig> mrna levels did not differ significantly  as a result of the treatment , despite the development of ovarian architecture. this was unexpected because sox <dig> upregulation induces testis formation in eutherian mammals  <cit> .

sox <dig> protein remains cytoplasmic in the presence of oestrogen
as a transcription factor, it is not just the level of sox <dig>  but also its subcellular localization that is essential for its function in initiating testicular development  <cit> . we therefore investigated sox <dig> protein distribution using immunocytochemistry in two control and two oestrogen-treated xy gonads. in control xy gonads, sox <dig> was almost entirely nuclear and restricted to the sertoli cells of the developing testis, consistent with its distribution seen during normal in vivo development  <cit>  . however, xy gonads cultured in the presence of oestrogen had diffuse sox <dig> staining that was restricted to the cytoplasm of gonadal cells and did not enter the nuclei . since sox <dig> levels were sexually dimorphic before gonadal differentiation, we also investigated protein distribution at day  <dig> of gestation . at this stage, sox <dig> had a strong cytoplasmic distribution but had become nuclear in a subset of somatic cells .

exogenous oestrogen activates the female differentiation pathway
in addition to the downregulation of testicular genes, oestrogen exposure and lack of nuclear sox <dig> in the tammar sex-reversed xy gonads led to an upregulation of the key ovarian differentiation genes foxl <dig>  and wnt <dig>  , consistent with findings that both genes are critical early regulators of ovarian development  <cit> . in tammar sex-reversed gonads, fgf <dig> was downregulated in concert with wnt <dig> upregulation, supporting a conserved antagonistic interaction between these two genes in mammalian gonadal differentiation  <cit> . rspo <dig> was significantly downregulated  in the presence of oestrogen, consistent with the normal expression of this gene at day  <dig> pp in males and females, suggesting that at this stage of development, rspo <dig> is not required for marsupial ovarian differentiation. fst mrna expression was not significantly altered by oestrogen treatment .

discussion
marsupials occupy a unique evolutionary niche and can provide important information on the evolution and conservation of mammalian developmental pathways. this is the first comprehensive study of the expression levels of key testicular and ovarian genes during gonadogenesis in any marsupial. during normal development in the tammar gonad, expression of key male development genes is similar to that seen in the mouse and human, except that amh and sox <dig> show sexually dimorphic gene expression before the peak in sry expression at day  <dig> pp. furthermore, sox <dig> has already begun its nuclear translocation  <dig> days before the peak in sry expression and the appearance of testicular cords. this may be the result of the long period of sry expression seen in marsupials  <cit> , similar to that of human xy gonads  <cit>  but different from the ultrashort pulse seen in mice  <cit> . the key female development genes foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> were upregulated in the xx gonad during the time of ovarian development . however, rspo <dig> and fst expression was variable in the early gonad, and female-specific upregulation was seen only during the later stages of ovarian development. this observation suggests that these two genes act downstream of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> in the ovarian differentiation pathway, at least in the tammar.

cultured xy control gonads had normal male expression profiles and formed testicular cords. however, xy gonads cultured in the presence of oestrogen failed to upregulate sry and amh expression and instead upregulated foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  the oestrogen-exposed xy gonads also developed ovarian architecture, confirming that female development had occurred. surprisingly, mrna levels for sox <dig>  the key factor essential for testicular development, did not differ between control and treated xy gonads, despite ovarian development. to investigate this further, we examined the protein localisation of sox <dig> in control and oestrogen-treated xy gonads. since sox <dig> is a transcription factor, nuclear localisation is essential to activate the male developmental program and sox <dig> mutations that affect nuclear import result in xy sex reversal in humans  <cit> . in the mouse and human, the sox <dig> protein is initially cytoplasmic in the indifferent gonad of both xx and xy fetuses, but becomes rapidly nuclear and upregulated only after the peak of sry expression in testes, whereas in ovaries, sox <dig> remains cytoplasmic and is lost  <cit> . in the clawed toad, xenopus, sox <dig> also remains cytoplasmic in developing ovaries but becomes nuclear under testis-promoting conditions in the absence of oestrogen and is upregulated  <cit> . however, in the presence of oestrogen under ovary-promoting conditions, sox <dig> remains cytoplasmic and is downregulated.

in mice, sry initiates sox <dig> upregulation within pre-sertoli cells. sox <dig> then autoregulates to reach threshold levels that activate testicular development  <cit> . in the tammar, sry had initiated sox <dig> upregulation before the cultures began  and before the peak in sry expression  <dig> days later. thus oestrogen exposure at this time  did not prevent the initial wave of sox <dig> mrna upregulation, but the protein was restricted to the cytoplasm of somatic cells, preventing its activation of the male pathway and likely its self-propagated upregulation. this observation explains the initiation of ovarian development in the treated xy gonads in this in vitro study and in the earlier in vivo studies  <cit> . treatment of developing turtle gonads with oestrogen at stages of development before gonadal sex determination had occurred  prevented sox <dig> from becoming upregulated to equivalent male or even female levels  <cit> . these findings suggest that there is also a direct action of oestrogen in repressing sox <dig> transcription in turtles, as we have observed in the tammar. interestingly, in the turtle, sox <dig> protein is nuclear in female gonads before sex determination. we see a similar nuclear localization in the indifferent gonad in the tammar wallaby . we hypothesize that in the absence of hormones at early stages of gonadal development, sox <dig> can feely translocate to the nucleus of somatic cells. in mammals, sox <dig> expression is reinforced by sry, upregulating it above threshold levels enabling it to autoregulate and initiate testicular development. in nonmammalian vertebrates, the oestrogen production could act to directly suppress sox <dig> upregulation and promote ovarian development. our results show that oestrogen restricts translocation of the sox <dig> protein, forcing it to remain in the cytoplasm and prevent its self-propagated upregulation. since sox <dig> mrna is never elevated above basal levels in the oestrogen-treated male turtle, the effect of oestrogen on its subcellular localization cannot be observed in their gonads. however, in our study, we administered oestrogen slightly later in development, just after the initial wave of sox <dig> upregulation. our results therefore highlight a mechanism by which oestrogen could prevent testicular development . the exclusion of sox <dig> from somatic cell nuclei of the oestrogen cultured gonads is further confirmed by the failure of amh upregulation because in the mouse, sox <dig> acts as a nuclear transcription factor to drive amh expression  <cit> .

in the absence of nuclear sox <dig> in xy oestrogen-treated gonads, female development was initiated. foxl <dig> was significantly upregulated, consistent with an early and essential role for this gene in initiating ovarian development in mammals. in goats, foxl <dig> induces aromatase  expression, leading to oestrogen production in the developing ovary  <cit> . this mechanism could potentially ensure a block in male development by excluding sox <dig> nuclear entry. this mechanism could work in synergy with activated ers to facilitate foxl <dig> binding to tesco, further suppressing sox <dig> mrna production as recently suggested in goats  <cit> . however, the oestrogen response elements contained within the mouse tesco element  <cit>  do not fall into the evolutionarily conserved regions identified in most vertebrates  <cit> , suggesting that this mechanism of oestrogen action may not be as important as its role to prevent sox <dig> from entering the nucleus.

several lines of evidence demonstrate that oestrogen acts as a modulator of the subcellular localization of sox <dig>  sox <dig> is produced at a low level in the somatic cells of the adult mouse ovary  <cit> , but its self-propagated upregulation is somehow blocked. our findings suggest that circulating oestrogen could prevent the nuclear translocation of sox <dig> in differentiated ovarian somatic cells, thus preventing its own upregulation. in the absence of oestrogen in female aromatase-deficient knockout mice, sox <dig> is upregulated in ovarian somatic cells, as it can presumably translocate to the nucleus to propagate its own transcription. however, when exogenous oestrogen is administered to aromatase-deficient mice, this effect is reversible and sox <dig> is repressed  <cit> . this mechanism therefore explains how sox <dig> upregulation is able to occur in the oestrogen-deficient mouse ovary and how it can be subsequently suppressed with somatic cell transdifferentiation in the presence of exogenous oestrogen. these findings suggest that in mammals, oestrogen may still be a critical factor regulating ovarian somatic cell fate maintenance by preventing sox <dig> nuclear translocation.

this fundamental role of oestrogen can explain its sex-determining ability in nonmammalian vertebrates. sox <dig> remains cytoplasmic in the developing ovaries of nonmammalian vertebrates in the presence of oestrogen  <cit> . however, in the absence of oestrogen, sox <dig> becomes nuclear and testicular development is initiated  <cit> . our findings suggest that this may be a universal action of oestrogen in all vertebrates.

how oestrogen prevents sox <dig> from entering the nucleus is still unknown. there are several known pathways that control sox <dig> nuclear entry, such as altered importin-β <dig> or calmodulin binding, both of which facilitate effective transport of sox <dig> across the nuclear pore complex  <cit> . in addition, sumoylation and/or ubiquitination also affect the subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of sox <dig>  <cit> . oestrogen is known to directly affect sumoylation and the subcellular localization of the nuclear receptor coactivator family member  <dig> protein in breast cancer cell lines  <cit> . oestrogen may work in a similar way in the gonad by modulating sumoylation and/or ubiquitination of the sox <dig> protein, trapping it in the cytoplasm.

CONCLUSIONS
we have uncovered a mechanism using a marsupial model that provides a link between mammalian and nonmammalian vertebrate sex determination mechanisms . we have shown that exogenous oestrogen can inhibit the nuclear translocation of sox <dig>  blocking testicular development in an xy mammalian gonad. as a result, ovarian differentiation occurred, concomitant with upregulation of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> . we propose a model in which the role of oestrogen is to modulate the subcellular localization of sox <dig> . this could be an underlying and ancestral mechanism that controls ovarian development in nonmammalian vertebrates. in the absence of oestrogen in developing male fetuses, sox <dig> would become nuclear and initiate testicular differentiation. however, in those nonmammalian vertebrates destined to become females, expression of aromatase and the production of oestrogen could prevent the nuclear translocation of sox <dig>  thus actively blocking testicular development. in mammals, the retention of this mechanism is not an evolutionary remnant of past function, but may have been retained to ensure that sox <dig> nuclear entry is suppressed in the mature ovary to maintain granulosa cell fate.
