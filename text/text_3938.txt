BACKGROUND
mungbean  is an important legume crop with high nutritional value in south and southeast asia. because of its high content of easily digestible protein and relatively high iron and folate contents, it represents a nutrition-balanced food for cereal-based diets . mungbean is also consumed as sprouts, which are important sources of vitamins and minerals  <cit> .

bruchids , the bean weevils, cause serious damage to and loss of legume seeds, including mungbean, during storage  <cit> . infestation of the crop is generally low in the field. only a few insect-infested seeds are needed for the initial inoculum for population build-up during grain storage  <cit> . bruchid development from eggs to pupae takes place in a single seed, the larva being the most destructive stage. the emerging adults deposit eggs on the seed, causing rapid multiplication of the pest during storage and resulting in up to 100 % of grain loss.

only a few bruchid-resistant mungbean varieties are available today  <cit>  and resistant lines adapted to the tropics are lacking. chemical controls with organophosphate compounds, synthetic pyrethroids or insect growth regulators widely used to protect mungbean against this pest  <cit>  are expensive, with risks to consumer health and the environment and development of insecticide tolerance by the pest  <cit> . biological control by the bruchid parasitoid dinarmus sp. is less efficient than chemicals in reducing the storage pest effects  <cit> . therefore, host resistance would be the most sustainable and economical way to preserve mungbean seeds against destruction by bruchids during storage.

the wild mungbean accession v. radiata var. sublobata tc <dig> from madagascar is resistant to many bean weevil species, including callosobruchus chinensis, c. phaseoli, c. maculatus, and zabrotes subfasciatus  <cit> . tc <dig> is easily crossed with v. radiata, and the bruchid resistance of this accession was introduced into the cultivated gene pool . the bruchid resistance of tc <dig> was proposed to depend on a single dominant gene plus one or a few modifier factors . a bruchid-resistant gene  for this line has not yet been identified, although several candidate genes have been suggested and genetic markers co-segregating with the br gene have been described. on restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of 58 f <dig> progenies from a cross of tc <dig> and a susceptible mungbean, vc <dig>  the br was mapped to a single locus on linkage group viii, approximately  <dig>  centimorgans  from the nearest rflp marker  <cit> . later,  <dig> randomly amplified polymorphic dna  markers were found associated with the br gene in a segregating population derived from tc <dig> and nm <dig>  a bruchid-susceptible mungbean  <cit> . rna-directed dna polymerase, gypsy/ty- <dig> retroelement and chloroplast nadh dehydrogenase subunit genes were highly associated with the proposed br gene of mungbean  <cit> . further quantitative trait loci  analysis revealed one major and two minor qtl for bruchid resistance in tc <dig>  <cit> . seed metabolite analysis in line bc20f <dig> derived from a cross between tc <dig> and a susceptible cultivar osaka-ryokuto suggested the involvement of cyclopeptide alkaloids named vignatic acids with bruchid resistance. the gene responsible for vignatic acid  accumulation was mapped to a single locus,  <dig>  cm away from the previously mapped br gene  <cit> . additionally, a small cysteine-rich protein, vrcpr protein, which is lethal to c. chinensis larvae, was identified in tc <dig>  <cit> . proteomic research has proposed that chitinase, beta- <dig> -glucanase, peroxidase, provicilin and canavalin precursors play a role in bruchid resistance of mungbean  <cit> .

the implication of proteinase and amylase inhibitor activity in bruchid resistance in legumes remains controversial . whether these candidate factors indeed associated with previously described bruchid-resistant qtl  <cit>  and contributed to resistance remained unknown. some of the putative br factors of tc <dig> may be harmful for human consumption  <cit> . because the chemical nature of the resistance factor is still unknown, the safety of using the resistance factors derived from tc <dig> is difficult to assess. despite much effort directed toward the identification of bruchid-resistant factors, physiological differences between bruchid-resistant and -susceptible mungbean have not been reported.

a molecular marker associated with br would facilitate breeding of bruchid-resistant varieties, and mapping of the resistance genes also would help identify factors underlying resistance. available markers have not been validated for breeding, and more information on br is required to generate reliable markers for breeding bruchid-resistant mungbean varieties. gene-based or regulatory sequence-based markers would be the most efficient for selecting bruchid-resistant lines in breeding programs. in contrast to resistance locus-linked rflp and rapd markers, resistance-gene or regulatory sequence-based markers cannot be separated from the resistant phenotypes by recombination and thus are more reliable for selection. bruchid resistance is assumed to be due to the expression of resistance factors. resistance factors could be direct products of resistance genes that are absent in susceptible lines, or could result from activity changes of factors in susceptible and resistant lines due to sequence variation or from expression differences of resistance genes. polymorphisms related to any of these differences would provide reliable markers for resistance.

recently, the whole-genome sequence of a bruchid-susceptible mungbean  was published  <cit> . here we report the whole-genome sequence of a bruchid-resistant recombinant inbred line  and an increased number of available gene annotations for mungbean, by  <dig>  genes. we have identified differentially expressed genes  and nucleotide variations  in the promotor regions of degs and in the exons of sequence-changed protein genes . the putative effects of degs and scps on bruchid resistance of mungbean are discussed and molecular markers derived from nvs that can be used for selection of resistant lines are reported.

RESULTS
genome size of different mungbean cultivars and wild relatives
the genome size estimated by cytometry ranged from about  <dig> to 555 mb   in the lines under investigation. we found about a 20-mb difference in genome size between wild mungbean tc <dig>  and the cultivar nm <dig> . the genome size of ril <dig>  offspring of a cross between tc <dig> and nm <dig>  was similar to that of its female parent nm <dig>  whereas k-mer frequency distribution analysis of ril <dig> suggested a genome size of 452 mb. the estimated genome size of the buchid-susceptible mungbean line vc1973a, recently sequenced  <cit> , was about 502 mb, similar to the size of the bruchid-resistant mungbean line v2802; another bruchid-resistant mungbean line, v <dig>  had the largest genome size in our study.table  <dig> genome size of mungbean varieties

de novo genome assembly of ril59
the previously published whole genome sequence for mungbean is derived from the bruchid-susceptible cultivar vc1973a  <cit> . for genomic comparison and to facilitate research on bruchid resistance of mungbean, we sequenced and assembled the draft genome of the bruchid-resistant line ril <dig>  whose br gene was inherited from the wild mungbean accession tc <dig>  sequencing of four dna libraries, including two paired-end and two mate-pair libraries with various fragment lengths , resulted in  <dig>  gb  of sequence information, which corresponds approximately to a  <dig> -fold sequencing coverage according to the genome size of ril <dig> . de novo assembly of the sequence reads resulted in  <dig> scaffolds with an n <dig> of  <dig>  kb  comprising  <dig>  mb  and contributed to approximately 88 % of the estimated genome size of ril <dig> . the largest scaffold had a length of  <dig>  mb.table  <dig> summary of de novo genome assembly of ril59



gene annotation
in total,  <dig>  % of the draft genome was classified as repeat sequences and  <dig>  % as long tandem repeat  elements. the repeat elements were annotated by using the tigr plant repeat database . sixteen paired-end rna libraries  constructed from ril <dig> tissues and different ril seeds represented  <dig>  gb. rna-seq data for ril <dig>  and ncbi  soybean refseq protein sequences were aligned to the repeat-masked genome to identify splice junctions for gene prediction. overall,  <dig>  % of the rna-seq data mapped uniquely to splice junctions. ab initio gene prediction combined with protein alignment resulted in annotations for  <dig>  protein-coding genes;  <dig> of these encoded for multiple isoforms, for  <dig>  transcripts in total. overall, 85 % of the  <dig>  predicted-gene models had matches in the ncbi non-redundant protein database. the predicted-gene models consisted of transcript lengths of 4108 bp, coding lengths of 1290 bp, and  <dig>  exons per gene, on average.table  <dig> repeated sequences annotation of repeat elements from the tigr database



identification of bruchid-resistance–associated genes by transcriptome comparison
we searched for bruchid-resistance–associated genes by comparing the seed transcriptome of bruchid-resistant  and -susceptible  mungbean lines , including two parental lines of a population of nm <dig>  and tc <dig> , and rils derived from this population: ril <dig>  and three pairs of rils, each pair with contrasting bruchid resistance. two methods to identify degs by rna-seq were applied. the first approach, which involved calculating the number of transcripts per million , revealed  <dig> up- and  <dig> downregulated genes in seeds of bruchid-resistant mungbean . three of the upregulated genes  were specifically detected in r mungbean, and two downregulated genes  were specifically detected in s mungbean.fig.  <dig> transcriptome analysis of bruchid-resistant–associated genes in mungbean. bruchid-resistant–associated genes were selected from transcripts per million  fold change comparison and deseq analysis of transcriptomes between brucnid-resistant and -susceptible mungbean. the number of degs selected by each criterion is indicated. up and down represent the genes up- and downregulated, respectively, in bruchid-resistant mungbean



the second approach by deseq analysis  <cit>  of the same nine transcriptomes identified  <dig> transcripts of  <dig> degs;  <dig> were up- and  <dig> downregulated in bruchid-resistant mungbean . the downregulated gene g <dig> was present in two splice forms, g <dig> t <dig> and g <dig> t <dig>  ten genes  were expressed only in bruchid-resistant lines and three  only in bruchid-susceptible lines. together, the two approaches identified  <dig> degs most likely related to bruchid resistance. we classified the  <dig> consensus genes pinpointed by both approaches as major bruchid-resistance–associated genes and the other  <dig> as minor bruchid-resistance–associated genes .

the  <dig> consensus genes are most likely highly related to bruchid resistance of mungbean, especially the  <dig> upregulated genes . however, five of these genes have unknown function, including three with no hits on blastx analysis. the putative ubn2_ <dig> domain of g <dig> and rvt_ <dig> domain of g <dig> implying their transposase activity, together with the putative gag/pol polyprotein, g <dig>  represented transposable elements . the remaining genes encoded a putative mcm2-related protein, a putative adenylate cyclase, a senescence regulator and a resistant-specific protein .

rt-qpcr analysis of the rna-seq data verified the  <dig> consensus genes . ten upregulated genes were in all r mungbean lines as compared with s lines, except g <dig> and g <dig> were undetected in the bruchid-resistant ril <dig>  among the five downregulated genes, g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> were consistently downregulated in all r lines as compared with s lines.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr validation of differentially expressed genes . rt-qpcr results of the pattern of gene expression between bruchid-resistant and -susceptible mungbean. the y axis indicates the relative quantity  of gene expression with mungbean vractin  used as a control. data are rq ± se of ΔΔct from three experimental repeats. the x axis indicates different bruchid-resistant  and -susceptible  mungbean lines. asterisk indicates that the expression of the gene was not detected in the parental line nm <dig> with ct value set to 40 cycles for calculating the rq of gene expression



the high consistency between rna-seq and rt-qpcr results implied the degs might represent the biological difference between r and s mungbean seeds. in terms of functional categorization based on gene annotation combined with predicted protein domains,  <dig> of the  <dig> degs encoded proteins with enzymatic activities, four encoded resistant-related proteins and eight encoded tes . among the degs,  <dig> were involved in metabolic pathways, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and cellular processes .fig.  <dig> pie chart representing the functional categories of degs and sequence-changed-protein genes . degs  and scps  were functionally classified into categories based on annotation and the putative protein domains they harbored. the number of genes in each category is indicated in parentheses



two of the degs, g <dig> and g <dig>  encoded a cysteinyl endopeptidase and a basic 7s globulin  <dig> precursor, respectively. the former has protease activity and the latter was implicated in bruchid resistance  <cit> . both proteins are predicted to contain an inhibitor domain . however, we found their expression downregulated in bruchid-resistant mungbean , which suggests that these proteins have no role in resistance.

nvs in promoter regions might affect the expression of genes. a survey of nvs including substitutions and insertions and deletions  by comparing genomic sequences of bruchid-resistant and -susceptible lines revealed that  <dig> nvs located in the 2-kb region presumably included the promoter regions of  <dig> consensus degs . the number of nv sites in the 2-kb regions ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> .

identification of bruchid-resistance–associated scps
in addition to degs, nvs including nonsynonymous substitutions and indels in exon regions producing scps can modify protein functions, without necessarily changing gene expression. because genetic codes stored in rna are directly transmitted to proteins, we compared nvs of genes based on rna-seq data between bruchid-resistant and -susceptible lines and found  <dig> consensus nvs on  <dig> transcripts  . the confidence of nvs was verified by genomic sequence comparison of a few genes between ril <dig> and its parents. for illustration, seven nvs were proposed on g <dig> cdna by rna-seq comparison . genomic sequence results confirmed that these nvs consistently exist in r mungbean, lines ril <dig> and tc <dig>  and s mungbean, nm <dig> .fig.  <dig> validation of nucleotide variations  identified by rna sequence comparison. gene g <dig> was used to illustrate the verification of nvs. the upper panel shows the cdna sequence of g <dig> and the seven nvs  identified by rna sequence comparison of bruchid-resistant  and -susceptible  mungbean. the nvs in parentheses show the nucleotides in r mungbean  changed to that in s mungbean . the lower panel shows the validation of nvs by genomic sequencing between r mungbean lines ril <dig> andtc <dig> and s line nm <dig>  the color of the letter is synchronized with that of the chromatogram for easy reading. the box indicates the site of nvs. the order of nv sites starts from down-left then down-right panels



of the  <dig> scps,  <dig> could be functionally annotated by blast analysis. most encoded proteins harbored enzymatic activities, and  <dig> encoded transcription factors. importantly, seven and four genes encoded resistant-related proteins and tes, respectively . similar to degs,  <dig> of the  <dig> scps were involved in pathways of metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes and organismal systems . degs and scps involved in conserved pathways implied the conserved intrinsic difference between r and s mungbean .

two of the scps, g <dig> and g <dig>  encoded putative pectinesterase inhibitor 3-like and kunitz trypsin inhibitor protein, respectively. whether they are involved in bruchid resistance needs further investigation.

mapping of bruchid-resistance–associated nvs in the mungbean genome
bruchid-resistance–associated degs and scps are potential br genes. hence, the nvs in the promoter region are potential regulatory-sequence–based markers, whereas nvs on scps are potential gene-based markers for resistance. we mapped the identified bruchid-resistance–associated nvs and genes to the mungbean genome of vc1973a  <cit>  to assess whether their genomic position co-localizes with previously reported bruchid-resistance–associated markers. the 2-kb promoter region considered to have putative regulatory sequences implicated in resistance for the  <dig> degs was mapped to pseudochromosomes of mungbean  <cit> . the promoters of these degs were found unevenly distributed over the  <dig> chromosomes, and most sequences were mapped to chromosome  <dig> and to  <dig> scaffolds . similarly,  <dig> nvs of  <dig> scp genes were unevenly distributed over the  <dig> chromosomes and  <dig> scaffolds of the mungbean reference sequence  <cit> . interestingly, most of these sequences were mapped to chromosome  <dig> . therefore,  <dig> bruchid-resistance–associated nvs were mapped to  <dig> chromosomes and  <dig> scaffolds of the reference sequence .table  <dig> mapping of bruchid-resistance–associated genes on mungbean pseudochromosome

the promoter 2-kb sequences of differentially expressed genes  and sequences of sequence-changed-protein genes  were mapped on the  <dig> pseudochromosomes  and scaffolds of mungbean  <cit> . the total number of genes mapped to vr <dig>  vr <dig>  vr <dig> and scaffolds were not equal to the sum of degs and scps because some scps also belonged to degs



the two published bruchid-resistance–associated markers, the cleaved amplified polymorphic dna  marker opw02a <dig> and the simple sequence repeat  marker dmb-ssr <dig>  <cit> , were mapped to scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig> of ril <dig>  respectively, and both mapped to chromosome  <dig> of the mungbean reference . in the present study,  <dig> bruchid-resistance–associated genes, including degs and scps, were mapped to chromosome  <dig> of mungbean. the mapping results revealed a striking difference in promoter region of g <dig> between ril <dig> and vc1973a. a similar phenomenon was observed with the promoters of g <dig> and the gene body of g <dig> . these results imply that the genome structure at these positions differs between ril <dig> and vc1973a, which might be related to the difference in resistance against bruchids.fig.  <dig> map of bruchid-resistant–associated genes on chromosome  <dig>  of vc1973a. the corresponding scaffold for each gene in ril <dig> is at both sides. the two bruchid-resistant markers are in red. the degs are indicated in blue and scps in black. the degs with an asterisk are also scps. for degs, the 2-kb promoter sequences were used for mapping, whereas for scps, the gene sequences were used

generation of bruchid-resistance–associated markers
from the bruchid-resistance–associated nvs, we selected long sequence indels and designed primers  for pcr-based molecular markers. three markers derived from nvs on promoters of degs could distinguish r and s mungbean well between ril <dig>  two parents and three sets of rils . marker g779p produced a smaller band in r than s mungbean. marker g34480p produced a band only in r mungbean, as expected, but a smaller size in rils than tc <dig>  marker g34458p produced a small band in r mungbean and a large band in s mungbean. further applying these markers together with the two bruchid-resistance–associated markers, the cap marker opw02a <dig> and ssr marker dmb-ssr <dig>  <cit> , to  <dig> rils revealed dmb-ssr <dig> with the highest accuracy,  <dig>  %, in selecting mungbean with bruchid resistance. the cap marker opw02a <dig>  analyzed by digesting the pcr products with haeiii restriction enzyme, exhibited  <dig>  % accuracy. the new developed markers g779p and g34480p exhibited  <dig>  % accuracy, which was better than the  <dig>  % accuracy of marker g34458p .fig.  <dig> bruchid-resistant–associated markers of mungbean. markers designed from promoter sequences g779p, g34480p, and g34458p were used for selecting bruchid-resistant  and -susceptible  mungbean. the numbers  <dig> to  <dig> indicate different mungbean lines, named tc <dig>  ril <dig>  nm <dig>  ril <dig>  ril <dig>  ril <dig>  ril <dig>  ril <dig> and ril <dig>  respectively. pcr products of g779p and g34458p were analyzed on 4 % agarose gel and that of g34480p on 1 % agarose gel



discussion
genome size of mungbean
the genome size, dna quantity, or so-called c-value is important for genome polyploidy, phylogenetic and taxa research . recently, a reliable genome size for achieving the correct coverage and estimating the percentage of repeated sequences of a genome has become an important parameter for planning next-generation sequencing  experiments. many methods have been used to estimate the genome size of organisms. besides k-mer frequency distribution analysis together with ngs, flow cytometry has become the most popular method for estimating genome size  <cit>  and is superior to other methods such as dna phosphate content measurement  <cit> , analysis of reassociation kinetics  <cit> , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  <cit>  and image analysis of feulgen photometry  <cit>  because of its convenience, fast processing and reliability  <cit> .

the same flow cytometry system should be used for comparing plant genome sizes  <cit>  and should avoid the use of an animal genome as a reference  <cit> . with these recommendations, the genome size estimation for the mungbean lines in our study varied by more than 60 mb, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb , whereas previous reports estimated the genome sizes between  <dig> and 579 mb  <cit> . the large variation in estimations between the studies may be due to variation in mungbean lines and different strategies and methods used for analyses. the genome size of mungbean vc1973a was estimated at 579 mb by flow cytometry with nuclei from chicken red blood cells used as an internal standard  <cit> , even though the use of animal genomes as a standard is not recommended for plant genome size prediction. the 25-base k-mer frequency distribution in ngs provided an estimated genome size of 548 mb for v1973a  <cit> , which is slightly larger than that by flow cytometry . similarly, the estimated genome size for the wild mungbean tc <dig> was about 494 mb in our flow-cytometry research but 501 mb by 25-base k-mer frequency distribution  <cit> . in contrast, our k-mer frequency distribution provided a size estimate of 452 mb for ril <dig>  smaller than by flow cytometry . the purity of the constructed dna libraries for ngs would affect the reliability of k-mer frequency distribution used to estimate genome size  <cit> . in our study, we used a flow-cytometry method with arabidopsis nuclei as an internal standard to estimate the mungbean genome size and for a more reliable explanation of the ngs data obtained from ril <dig> 

variation in the quantity of repetitive dna sequences is the main factor determining genome size  <cit> . this fact was not true for the mungbean lines in our study. ril <dig>  with a larger genome than that for vc1973a or tc <dig>  contained only  <dig>  % repetitive sequences as compared with  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for vc1973a and tc <dig>  respectively. the difference in proportion of repetitive sequences in tc <dig> and its offspring ril <dig> suggests that heterozygosity of the genome in a hybrid can lead to loss of repetitive sequences.

genome assembly and gene annotation
our genome assembly of ril <dig> is comparable to that of vc1973a, which had  <dig> scaffolds with n <dig> length of  <dig>  mb and 80 % genome coverage  <cit> . we made available a draft genome of a bruchid-resistant variety. comparing this genome with the available sequence from bruchid-susceptible vc1973a can reveal genomic regions responsible for resistance. the annotated  <dig>  genes in ril <dig> are  <dig>  genes greater than that reported for vc1973a  <cit> . the larger number of annotated genes could be due to the inclusion of more varied tissues and developmental stages of ril <dig> than in the previous study, for a broader capture of different genes. we included rna from seeds, different developmental stages of pods, 2- to 7-day-old seedlings and 1-month-old whole plants, for broader range of developmental stages and tissues and probably a more complete rna population. the genome sequence information for the bruchid-resistant ril <dig> and a more complete gene annotation of mungbean will contribute to improving “omic” research and promoting the breeding of mungbean in all aspects.

degs and scps together maintain transcript diversity in bruchid-resistant mungbean
research of bruchid resistance has focused on breeding and developing molecular markers . studies of resistance mechanisms at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels were attempted but did not reach final conclusions  <cit> . we found that degs and scps might be strategies bruchid-resistant mungbean uses to retain transcript diversity and specificity. therefore, further proteomic research of mungbean for bruchid resistance should consider both the effects of scps and quantity of differential proteins. the degs and scps related to bruchid resistance might be overestimated in our research for a few reasons. first, based on genetic and qtl studies , a major br locus and two minor loci that might contain one to a few genes were proposed to be responsible for bruchid resistance in mungbean. second, the rils we used were not near-isogenic lines. thus, not all of the identified degs and scps are likely to be directly associated with bruchid resistance. third, nonsynonymous substitution due to nvs indeed may not affect the protein function and further biochemical characters in mungbean seeds. further functional study of the selected degs and scps will help to evaluate their roles in bruchid resistance of mungbean.

although the transcriptome of mature mungbean seeds most likely reflects what seeds prepared for the upcoming germination and may not be directly related to bruchid resistance of mungbean, the conserved expression pattern of degs implies that nvs on their promoters and those on scps can be potential molecular markers for mungbean breeding. use of the promoter-based markers designed from bruchid-resistance–associated genes can indeed offer a high selection rate of bruchid-resistant mungbean.

both degs and scps are involved in similar functional gene categories and conserved metabolic pathways, which implies intrinsic differences between bruchid-resistant and -susceptible mungbean. whether these intrinsic differences of mungbean represent modifier factors or minor loci modulating bruchid resistance described in previous investigations  <cit>  needs further evaluation. however, almost one-quarter of the degs do not harbor nvs on their promoter regions, which suggests alternative mechanisms for differential regulation than sequence variation in these regions involved in regulating the expression of these genes.

the search for a br gene responsible for bruchid resistance of mungbean
great efforts have been invested in mapping a br gene in mungbean  <cit> . first, a single br gene was proposed in tc <dig>  and later additional minor modifier factors were postulated  <cit> ; nevertheless, the nature of the br gene of tc <dig> remained unclear. biochemically, several br candidate genes highly associated with bruchid resistance have been reported, including the va gene for vignatic acid biosynthesis  <cit> ; vicilins, also known as 7s storage globulins  <cit> ; and the cysteine-rich protein vrd <dig>  <cit> . also, resistance-related proteins including chitinase, beta- <dig> -glucanase and peroxidase were proposed to play a role in bruchid resistance of mungbean  <cit> . however, in cowpea and common bean, protease and amylase inhibitors, lectins, chitinases, and beta- <dig> -glucanases are ineffective against c. maculatus and z. subfasciatus  <cit> . in our research, only two genes that likely contain inhibitor activities were among the degs and a further two among scps. the two degs were downregulated in bruchid-resistant mungbean, so they might not be involved in resistance, whereas the role of the two detected scps encoding inhibitor-like proteins needs further study. none of the other previously proposed br candidate genes was identified as a deg or scp, which reduces the probability that they play an important role in bruchid resistance of mungbean. thus, the identity of a br gene remains elusive.

from our research, the  <dig> degs and  <dig> scps are potential br candidates. the mapping results narrowed the number of candidates to  <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  where the two bruchid-resistant–associated markers, dmb-ssr <dig> and opw02a <dig>  are located. hence, genes located near the markers are potential br genes. however, the genome of mungbean is still incomplete, with many scaffold sequences that could not be assigned to the mungbean genome. genes mapping to scaffolds cannot be eliminated from the putative br gene list. different mungbean accessions showed different genome sizes. therefore, more genome sequencing is necessary to complete the genome assembly of mungbean, especially for tc <dig> and other bruchid-resistant sources, for facilitating br gene identification and mungbean breeding and improvement.

tes and bruchid resistance
almost half of the genome of mungbean contained repetitive sequences in most tes, including retrotransposons, transposons and miniature inverted-repeat tes . these elements are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes, although the content varies among the different organisms. they can represent 20 % of the genome, as for the drosophila melanogaster genome  <cit> , or 85 % for the zea mays genome  <cit> . tes are believed to be the major determinant of genome size  <cit> .

repetitive sequences, previously considered “junk dna”, were found to function in modifying the genome structure and gene function and regulating gene expression  <cit> . the involvement of the non-ltr retrotransposon cdt- <dig> in desiccation tolerance of craterostigma plantagineum by mediating small rna illustrated that tes regulate plant stress resistance  <cit> . could tes also be involved in bruchid-resistance? we found that genes encoding tes were degs and scps when comparing bruchid-resistant and -susceptible lines. in addition, the markers derived from te sequences well distinguished bruchid-susceptible from –resistant mungbean lines. more studies are required to clarify how tes are implicated in mungbean resistance or represent modifier factors for this trait.

CONCLUSIONS
here we provide whole-genome scaffold sequences for a bruchid-resistant mungbean line and increase the annotation of mungbean genes. we obtained a list of putative br genes and candidates of molecular markers for selecting resistant lines and proposed that besides the br gene, intrinsic differences caused by degs and scps of mungbean and tes are most likely the modifier factors determining bruchid resistance. as expected, when comparing only a few selected lines with contrasting resistance phenotypes, the identified sequence variations spanned the whole chromosome. however, analysis of all deg, scp and nv data revealed factors located on chromosome  <dig> involved with resistance. more sequence information from different bruchid-resistant sources are needed to facilitate and promote mungbean research and crop improvement.
