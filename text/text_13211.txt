BACKGROUND
the endothelins constitute a group of vasoactive peptides mainly produced by vascular endothelial cells  <cit> . there are two known endothelin receptors in mammals and both are found in the vascular wall. normally, the endothelin a  receptors are situated on the smooth muscle cells in arteries where they give rise to contractions, while the etb receptors are primarily seen on endothelial cells. an activation of the endothelial etb receptors will lead to dilatation  <cit> . interestingly enough, after organ culture of arteries  <cit> , experimental ischemic stroke  <cit>  and experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage  <cit>  there is an upregulation of contractile etb receptors located on the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries. we have revealed that this upregulation, when occurring in organ culture, is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinases   <cit>  and possibly protein kinase c   <cit> .

pkc was first discovered in  <dig>  <cit> , and comprises a family of serine/threonine kinases, which is divided into the conventional, the novel and the atypical pkcs  <cit> . the pkcs participate in a wide variety of intracellular signalling cascades and are activated by different stimuli, such as growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters  <cit> .

the pkc inhibitors ro-31- <dig> and ro-31- <dig>  used in previous studies of etb receptor upregulation  <cit> , have been shown to affect other intracellular signalling molecules, for example c-jun n-terminal kinase and mapk phosphatase- <dig>  <cit> . consequently there is a risk that the effect of the pkc inhibitors may be due to inhibition of other pathways rather than the pkc signalling pathway.

the aim of this study was therefore to establish the involvement of pkc in the upregulation of contractile etb receptors in rat middle cerebral arteries  during  <dig> hours of organ culture. this duration has proven to be an optimal time for obtaining an upregulation of contractile etb receptors  <cit> . subsequently, we wanted to examine where in the process of upregulation the pkcs were involved. this was done using a variety of pkc inhibitors which affect pkc in different manners. the endothelin receptors were examined both functionally with myographs, and on a molecular level with real-time pcr. immunohistochemistry was used to visualize the distribution of etb receptors on the arterial smooth muscle cells. finally, western blot was used to examine the levels of different pkc subtypes in the arteries after incubation with the pkc inhibitors.

the general pkc inhibitors tested, all of which are cell permeable, had different effects on the vascular etb receptor upregulation. bisindolylmaleimide i , ro-32- <dig> and pkc inhibitor 20– <dig>  all significantly affected the sarafotoxin 6c  induced contractility. in addition, ro-32- <dig> decreased the etb receptor mrna levels, as did bis i to some extent. pkci 20– <dig> had no such effect. however, pkci 20– <dig> did reduce the amount of etb receptor protein in the arteries and also decreased the protein amount of the five pkc subtypes tested .

RESULTS
contractile experiments
k+-induced contractions did not differ between the control group and the arteries incubated with each of the pkc inhibitors . previous studies have shown that s6c does not induce contraction of fresh mca segments  <cit> . after organ culture s6c produces contraction of cerebral arteries due to the enhanced expression of smooth muscle etb receptor. in the present study, the s6c induced contraction was significantly decreased in the arteries cultured with the pkc inhibitors bis i, ro-32- <dig> and pkci 20– <dig> as compared to control . ro-32- <dig> also affected the pec <dig> value of the s6c dose response curve considerably . the pkc inhibitor chelerythrine chloride had no effect on the s6c induced contraction and was therefore not included in the subsequent experiments . after addition of s6c, the etb receptors are desensitized and a subsequent application of endothelin- <dig>  only affects the remaining contractile eta receptors  <cit> .

*p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  compared to control. n represents the number of artery segments.

in the present study we found that the pkc inhibitors did not have any effect on neither the maximum et- <dig> induced contraction nor on the pec <dig> value of the et- <dig> concentration-response curve .

mrna analysis
mrna was analyzed with real-time pcr and standard curves were produced for each primer pair showing that all samples were within the linear amplification range. the slopes of the curves were close to  <dig> , thus the amplification was close to optimal .

the results of the real-time pcr showed that ro-32- <dig> decreased the eta receptor and etb receptor mrna levels significantly as compared to control . bis i behaved similarly in decreasing the etb receptor mrna levels, however not significantly . pkci 20– <dig> had no effect on the endothelin receptor mrna levels .

receptor protein expression
immunohistochemistry showed a clear decrease of etb receptors in the arteries treated with pkci 20– <dig> in comparison to control . there was a small decrease in etb receptor density in the arteries treated with ro-32- <dig>  and bis i , however it was not significant.

pkc subtype expression
western blot experiments were carried out using antibodies directed specifically against phosphorylated, and thereby activated, pkc isoforms . these tests showed that pkci 20– <dig> was able to decrease the protein amount of all five pkc subtypes tested, although the decrease was most prominent for pkcδ  and pkcγ . conversely ro-32- <dig> and bis i did not decrease the protein levels of the pkc subtypes.

discussion
this study shows that each of the three general pkc inhibitors attenuates the organ culture induced upregulation of the etb receptor mediated contraction seen in rat mca. a fourth pkc inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride, had no effect on the contractile responses of the arteries, and consequently was not included in the additional experiments. a possible explanation to this lack of effect could be that chelerythrine chloride has been shown to alter vasoconstrictive responses through interaction with various phosphodiesterases and thus lacks specificity  <cit> . furthermore, chelerythrine chloride activates c-jun n-terminal kinase pathways  <cit> . our group has recently discovered that c-jun n-terminal kinase plays an important role in the upregulation of etb receptors in porcine coronary arteries , which could explain why chelerythrine chloride fails to inhibit the etb receptor upregulation in the present study.

bis i and ro-32- <dig> are both competitive inhibitors for the atp-binding site of pkc  <cit> , but in a slightly different manner, which results in differences in pkc subtype affinity. bis i inhibits the conventional pkcs  with similar potency   <cit> , and the subtypes δ and ε to a lesser extent  <cit> . ro-32- <dig> mainly affects the α subtype , but also βi, βii and γ  <cit> .

the third inhibitor tested, the pkc inhibitor 20– <dig>  is a pseudosubstrate peptide, which mimics a particular domain of the pkc that keeps the enzyme in an inactive state  <cit> . the peptide is based on the pseudosubstrate motif of pkcα and β and is myristoylated to allow cell membrane permeability. all these three pkc inhibitors significantly reduced the organ culture induced upregulation of the etb receptor mediated contraction.

the real-time pcr showed that ro-32- <dig> and, to a certain extent, bis i blocked the elevated levels of etb receptor mrna relative to that seen in the control arteries. however, pkci 20– <dig> failed to exhibit this effect on the mrna level. instead, pkci 20– <dig> diminished etb receptor protein expression. one reason for this discrepancy could be that ro-32- <dig> and bis i exert their inhibitory effects earlier in the production of etb receptors in the arteries, possibly upstream from gene level, causing a decrease of the etb receptor mrna. pkci 20– <dig> on the other hand, affects the etb receptor protein production and not the mrna levels and hence at a translational level. in concert the pkci 20– <dig> decreased the amount of etb receptor protein as shown by immunohistochemistry, and marginally in the case of bis i and ro-32- <dig>  nevertheless, a small decrease could be enough to diminish the functional response. thus, the results could be interpreted to show a multiple role for pkc in the upregulation of etb receptors. another explanation for the difference between the mrna levels and the protein levels in the case of pkci 20– <dig> is that the inhibiting effect may not be as prolonged as for the two other inhibitors and subsequently, at the time point measured, the etb receptor mrna might be restored to its normal level.

the eta receptor mrna in rat cerebral arteries is not altered by  <dig> hours of organ culture  <cit> . still, ro-32- <dig> did decrease the eta receptor mrna levels after incubation. this was not accompanied by a diminished eta receptor mediated contraction. this discrepancy could be due to the fact that the mrna levels do not necessarily reflect the presence of functional receptors, and at a later time point, the eta receptor density will decrease.

previous studies with the pkc inhibitors ro-31- <dig> and ro-31- <dig> indicate that the conventional pkc subtypes  are involved in the etb receptor alteration after organ culture  <cit> . the present study confirms this, but also shifts the focus slightly towards the pkcδ subtype. this is interesting, since several studies have shown pkcδ to be deleterious in experimental ischemia  <cit> . for example, treatment with pkcδ inhibitors decreases infarct size  <cit> , and pkcδ knock-out mice show a decreased infarct size compared to wild type mice  <cit> . further studies need to be done to define the role of pkcδ in our experimental setting.

we have previously shown that in both experimental focal ischemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage there is an etb receptor upregulation in the mca  <cit> . this upregulation may lead to enhanced contraction of the arteries, which causes an attenuation of blood and oxygen supply to the infarcted area, and subsequently an aggravation of the ischemic damage. thus, according to our findings here, a beneficial effect of pkc inhibition in ischemia could in part be due to a reduction of the etb receptor upregulation in the cerebral arteries.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that pkc inhibitors are able to decrease the etb receptor contraction and expression in smooth muscle cells of mca following  <dig> hours of organ culture. a similar upregulation of contractile etb receptors has been seen in an experimental model of focal ischemia. the results of the present study can therefore be of significance in finding new therapeutic targets in cerebral ischemia.
