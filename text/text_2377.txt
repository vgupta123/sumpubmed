BACKGROUND
the methylotrophic yeast p. pastoris is widely used as a heterologous expression platform for the industrial production of a series of valuable proteins due to its excellent characteristics, such as highly inducible gene expression, high-density cell growth, and high secretory capability  <cit> . the n-glycosylation pathway in p. pastoris has been reengineered to produce heterologous pharmaceutical proteins with human-like n-glycan structures, which may further improve the importance of p. pastoris in the biopharmaceutical industry  <cit> . p. pastoris is also used as a model organism to study the protein expression machinery, such as protein folding and secretion  <cit> . apart from applications in protein expression, p. pastoris could also be used to study the biogenesis and degradation of the peroxisome  <cit> .

although the p. pastoris expression system has been investigated in numerous studies and has been commercially available for many years, there is still little physiological or genetic information available. a draft genome sequence of p. pastoris is now commercially available, but the strict obligation to keep the sequence information confidential has hampered the publication of relevant data  <cit> . due to the lack of reported p. pastoris genome sequence and related dna microarrays, alternative approaches such as heterologous hybridization of p. pastoris cdna with saccharomyces cerevisiae microarrays  <cit>  and transcript analysis with the aid of affinity capture   <cit>  have been exploited to study the p. pastoris transcriptome. the first dna microarray for p. pastoris was produced using commercial sequence data , containing partial p. pastoris genes, and examined the unfolded protein response during protein production  <cit> . recently, the genome sequences of three p. pastoris strains  have become publicly available. transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolic flux analysis data for p. pastoris will benefit from this now-public sequence information.

transcriptomics is a favored approach for analyzing mrna regulation patterns, providing snapshots of various physiological conditions or developmental stages. recently, a massively parallel mrna sequencing platform , based on next-generation sequencing technology, was used to map and quantify the dynamic transcriptome. although rna-seq is a recent technology, and is still in active development, it has clear advantages over existing hybridization-based or tag sequence-based approaches for transcriptome analysis  <cit> . it offers key advantages, detecting known transcripts at single-nucleotide resolution, measuring gene expression levels over a larger dynamic range, discovering new transcripts within the intronic and intergenic regions, characterizing antisense transcription and rna editing, and identifying alternative splicing events and gene fusion phenomena, as described in several reviews  <cit> . rna-seq data also show a high level of reproducibility, for both technical and biological replicates  <cit> .

to date, rna-seq has been used successfully to define the transcription landscape on a genome-scale for over a dozen higher eukaryotic organisms, ranging from animals to plants  <cit> . s. cerevisiae <cit> , schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> , candida albicans <cit> , aspergillus oryzae <cit> , aspergillus flavus <cit> , and several prokaryotes  <cit>  have also been subjected to transcriptome analysis using the rna-seq technology.

on an industrial scale, the majority of p. pastoris processes described so far use glycerol as the substrate for fast growth to obtain high cell densities and methanol as the substrate and inducer for heterologous protein production. in this research, we sequenced p. pastoris poly-enriched mrna from growth conditions using glycerol or methanol as a substrate. we investigated the complex transcriptome of p. pastoris on a genome-scale using the rna-seq technology. our results determined the transcription landscape on a whole p. pastoris genome scale  and transcriptional level for the majority of p. pastoris annotated genes , defined  <dig> novel transcripts, four new exons, and untranslated regions  for more than  <dig> genes. alternative upstream initiation codons  and upstream open reading frames  in the 5’-utrs of many genes were also identified. internal ribosome entry sites  were identified within the utrs of the genes encoding kinases and proteins involved in growth control. regarding as events in the p. pastoris transcriptome, retained introns  was determined to be the main as event and were produced predominantly by an intron definition  mechanism. based on the rna-seq data, we have depicted the differential gene expression of p. pastoris between growth conditions using glycerol and methanol as substrates and enriched the transcriptomic data available for p. pastoris.

RESULTS
summary of rna-seq data
to provide an analysis of the p. pastoris transcriptome at single base-pair resolution, cdna libraries were constructed from poly -enriched mrna of p. pastoris chemostat cultures and analyzed using high-throughput illumina sequencing. a paired-end sequencing strategy was used in rna sequencing, in which the read length was augmented to  <dig> base pairs . rna samples were prepared from the chemostat cultures of p. pastoris gs <dig> transformed with different expression vectors bearing a lipase gene from rhizomucor miehei , including a secretory expression plasmid, a surface display expression plasmid, and a plasmid without the rml gene  . when reaching the steady state, cell dry weights of p. pastoris strains were determined and samples were retained to isolate the rna. the cell dry weight of ckm, sem, sdem_replicate <dig>  sdem_replicate <dig>  sdeg_replicate <dig>  and sdeg_replicate <dig> was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l, respectively.

in total, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> reads within the samples cultivated with methanol as the substrate, representing ~ <dig> p. pastoris genomes , which gave enough information to accurately annotate the transcript structures. of the total reads,  <dig> % could be unambiguously mapped to the p. pastoris genome, of which  <dig> % were mapped to known exons and  <dig> % were located in intergenic and intronic regions . the paired-end sequencing strategy effectively reduced the number of multi-position mapped reads to only  <dig> % of the total reads . this strategy, combined with long-read sequencing technology, improved the read matching from 85%  to 93%   <cit> , and significantly increased the genome coverage, especially in the repeat regions  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> % of the total reads were of poor quality  and were discarded.

extensive coverage of the complete p. pastoris genome was detected in the rna-seq data . of the genome,  <dig> % was expressed as rna-seq reads . in the bioinformaticsgent online genome annotation system , in total,  <dig> protein-encoding genes were annotated in the  <dig> mbp genomic sequence of p. pastoris gs <dig> strain. of all the annotated genes, >  <dig> % were detected with >90% sequence coverage . however, using s. pombe, >  <dig> million reads with a length of  <dig> bp from six samples under different growth conditions, it was possible to detect transcription for virtually all of the annotated genes with >50% sequence coverage  <cit> . in this study,  <dig>  million reads with a length of  <dig> bp provided a much more elaborate transcriptional status for p. pastoris annotated genes, detecting genes with lower expression levels, providing a powerful tool to dissect the detailed structure of the p. pastoris transcriptome at the single-base pair resolution.

to quantify gene expression levels by rna-seq data, the number of reads per kilobase of exon region per million mapped reads  was calculated. the intronic and intergenic expression levels were only marginally lower than the expression level of exons  and the mean expression level of novel transcripts was remarkably lower than these of intronic and intergenic regions. overlapping transcriptional region in intergenic regions and antisense transcripts in intronic regions resulted in the higher expression level of intronic and intergenic regions. when an overlapping region occurs between two transcripts with opposite transcriptional orientation, its expression level was artificially elevated because reads mapping to both strands were all accounted. this becomes an issue especially in organisms with small genomes, where transcripts are densely packed. there were totally  <dig> overlapping transcripts detected in the rna-seq data . boxplot analysis revealed that the expression level of overlapping transcripts was indeed much higher than their flanking regions . of the  <dig> protein-coding genes in the p. pastoris genome database,  <dig> were expressed as > <dig> rpkm with >90% sequence coverage in the rna-seq data . the control sample  without heterologous gene expression under conditions similar to p. pastoris natural growth conditions was used to depict its gene expression model . of all the annotated genes,  <dig> genes were expressed greater than the 75thpercentile . the  <dig> go terms of the p. pastoris  <dig> genes were downloaded from the boinformaticsgent online genome annotation service  to perform gene ontology  analysis. gene ontology  analysis revealed that genes involved in the protein production system  and energy production system  were specifically enriched in this highly expressed gene group  < <dig> ). for expression levels ranging from the 25th to 75th percentiles ,  <dig> genes were detected, where no highly enriched gene group was identified, according to go functional enrichment analysis. the genes enriched in nucleic acid metabolic processes were expressed lower than the 25th percentile. that is, the rna-seq data and related go functional enrichment analysis clearly demonstrated that the expression levels of the genes involved in protein production and energy metabolism were high while that of the genes involved in nucleotide metabolism and genetic message transfer were low under ckm growth conditions, conforming to the physiological and metabolic status of p. pastoris under methanol-induced conditions.

novel annotation of p. pastoris transcriptome using rna-seq data
utr annotation for p. pastoris genes
by searching for a sharp reduction in the expression signal at both ends of the annotated genes, we identified the 5’- and 3’-boundaries of the p. pastoris genes. the 5’-utrs of  <dig> genes and 3’-utrs of  <dig> genes were defined . the median lengths of the 5’- and 3’-utrs were  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively , shorter than those of s. pombe   <cit> . there were  <dig> genes containing “atg” codons upstream of their annotated start codon  in their 5’-utrs, which may represent true initiation sites . in many eukaryotes, 5’-utrs contain upstream open reading frames , which can regulate protein production and mrna degradation  <cit> . our data also predicted uorfs for  <dig> genes .

ireses in the 5’-utrs of p. pastoris genes
translation initiation in the vast majority of cellular mrnas is mediated by a cap-dependent mechanism. however, under many cellular conditions  when cap-dependent translation initiation is compromised, protein synthesis is mediated via an alternative initiation pathway, the internal ribosome entry site  dependent translation initiation  <cit> . ires elements have been found in mrna from viruses, mammals, vertebrates, and yeasts  <cit> . however, ires elements have not previously been demonstrated in p. pastoris, a widely used protein expression platform, because of a lack of utr information. within the database of published ireses , cellular mrnas-encoded ireses are classified according to the gene product function. the ires-containing mrnas are always transcripted by the genes encoding transcription factors, translation factors, chaperones, kinases, and proteins involved in growth control  <cit> . of the 5’-utrs from  <dig> genes annotated in the present study, the 5’-utrs of the protein kinase pas_chr3_ <dig>  and pas_chr2-1_ <dig> , involved in growth control, were selected and monitored for ires activity.

to examine whether the chosen utrs mediated ires-dependent translation initiation, an upstream r. miehei lipase  gene and a downstream escherichia coli bl <dig> β-galactosidase gene  were separated by the selected utrs . the recombinant p. pastoris strains were cultivated on mdt plates to detect expression of the rml gene and on mdx plates to monitor the synthesis of β-galactosidase. as shown in figure 3b, the 5’-utrs of kog <dig> and gcn <dig> mediated the expression of the second cistron. in addition, pcr identification, with the corresponding cdna as a template, proved the integrity of the bicistronic mrnas and eliminated the possibility of rna splicing events . furthermore, we performed northern blot analysis to exclude cryptic promoter activity somewhere upstream of the lacz coding sequence . as shown in figure 3a, we constructed a control plasmid placz, in which the expression of lacz orf was controlled by the gap promoter. for each p. pastoris strain, a single signal was detectable in the corresponding immunoblot. the size of the dual reporter construct containing an upstream r. miehei lipase  and a downstream β-galactosidase gene  was longer than the lacz orf, indicating that there was no cryptic promoter activity somewhere upstream of the lacz coding sequence. these results suggested that the 5’-utrs of kog <dig> and gcn <dig> contained functional internal ribosomal entry sites. due to the powerful ability for identifying utr sequences of genes, next-generation massively parallel mrna sequencing  will undoubtedly promote the study of ires-dependent translation initiation mechanisms in p. pastoris.

novel transcripts and exons in the p. pastoris genome
based on the rna-seq data, the intergenic and intronic regions of the p. pastoris genome contained fragments with considerable expression levels . about  <dig> % of the total reads uniquely mapped to the intergenic regions . thus, we searched reads covering the intergenic regions for the potential novel transcripts by identifying stretches of  <dig> bp or longer with expression levels higher than the surrounding regions. according to these limitations,  <dig> novel transcripts were detected, with an average length of  <dig> bp, containing potential protein-encoding orfs . for the intronic regions, although only  <dig> % of total reads fell within these genomic areas , the average expression level reached about  <dig> rpkm . we analyzed these expressed introns and identified four new candidate exons in four known genes . two novel transcripts and one candidate exon were further confirmed by rt-pcr . it is worth mentioning that antisense transcription, convergent genes and overlapping genes may interrupt the annotation of the p. pastoris transcript structures, although the strand specificity of a new exon  was validated by a tagged rt-pcr method .

cataloging of alternative splicing in p. pastoris under different growth conditions
of all the p. pastoris genes,  <dig> %  contained two or more exons  <cit> . the average number of introns per gene was generally low, similar with s.cerevisiae <cit> . genome-wide detection of p. pastoris alternative splicing  events was conducted in multi-exon genes by performing computational analyses to determine known and putative splicing junctions and to identify alternative splicing sites using stringent criteria . of the seven major as types, only the retained intron , alternative 5’-splice sites , alternative 3’-splice sites , and skipped exons  were detected in p. pastoris . in total,  <dig>  p. pastoris genes underwent as with a total of  <dig> as events , which was the highest as frequency in yeast. in contrast, only four as events were detected in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  under vegetative growth with heat shock and there was no evidence for the existence of as events in s. pombe using the rna-seq technology  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> % of filamentous a. oryzae genes underwent as events, detected by deep sampling of its transcriptome  <cit> . previously it has been reported that the number and variety of introns and splice sites may be coupled with the phenomena of as events  <cit> , which was apparently applicable in s. cerevisiae and a. oryzae. in s. cerevisiae, 5% of all genes are spliced  <cit> . in a. oryzae,  <dig> % of the total genes contain at least one intron  <cit> . however, there are sometimes exceptions. for example, numerous intron-containing genes  do not undergo any as events in s. pombe <cit> . it is noteworthy that alternative splicing seldom yields a functional protein. only the intron retention events of pas_chr1-3_ <dig>  pas_chr2-1_ <dig> and pas_chr3_ <dig> could produce functional proteins.

we performed go functional enrichment analysis of p. pastoris alternatively spliced genes. of all the alternatively spliced genes,  <dig>  were annotated by go enrichment analysis via fisher’s exact test . regarding molecular function, genes producing proteins with ion transmembrane transporter activity and ion-transporting atpase activity have a high frequency of as events. cellular component analysis revealed that genes encoding macromolecular complexes and protein complexes were specifically enriched in as events. biological process analysis showed that as events occurred mainly in the processes of macromolecular complex assembly and cellular component organization.

ri is the dominant as variant in fungi with great statistical significance   <cit> . consistent with this, ri was detected as the main as event in our p. pastoris rna-seq data , accounting for  <dig> % of all as isoforms. in our study, rna samples were subjected to dnase treatment to eliminate any possible contamination with genomic dna. therefore, ri events in our data should not be interfered with by intronic genome sequences. ri events were further validated by qpcr. the results illustrated that the retained intron of the pas_chr1-1_ <dig> gene exhibited a transcriptional level equivalent to its annotated exon while the canonical intron had a relatively low transcriptional level . as events can be divided into four categories: ri, cassette exon , alternative last exons , and mutually exclusive exons ), a5ss, and a3ss. the ratio ce/ is usually used to summarize the pattern of the splice variants  <cit> . this ratio in p. pastoris was only  <dig> % , comparable to that of five formerly investigated fungi  <cit> . further, it has been suggested that ri was the main as type in p. pastoris. it has been reported that id, as one of the splice site recognition mechanisms in eukaryotes, was prone to produce ri variants and the retained introns were usually shorter than the constitutive introns  <cit> . the average length of the p. pastoris retained introns was  <dig> bp, shorter than the canonical introns  in p. pastoris. thus, p. pastoris may perform splice site recognition predominantly by the id mechanism.

analysis of differentially expressed genes in p. pastoris cultivated with glycerol and methanol
rna-seq technology, with its digital gene expression data, has been explored as a quantitative method to analyze differential gene expression between different physiological states of a given organism. in the industrial production of heterologous proteins, p. pastoris processes typically use glycerol as a substrate for cell growth and methanol as the substrate and inducer for heterologous protein production. here, we detected globally differential expressed genes in p. pastoris between the sdem culture and the sdeg culture, based on rna-seq data using the ‘r’  software. in order to rule out the influence on the gene expression due to copy number, we measured the copy number of aox <dig> promoter of the p. pastoris strains and found that each strain was transformed with a single copy control vector or the expression vector . to reduce conflicting expression variance in biological replicates, poly -enriched mrna for constructing rna-seq cdna libraries were derived from chemostat cultures of p. pastoris. the two biological replicates of p. pastoris sdem and sdeg cultures were in close agreement, with a  <dig>  pearson correlation coefficient. differentially expressed genes were identified based on the negative binomial distribution with variance and mean linked by local regression  <cit> . in total,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed under sdem culture compared with sdeg culture;  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated .

compared with the sdeg culture, in the sdem culture, go analysis and kegg metabolic pathway analysis revealed that up-regulated genes were specifically located in proteasome, autophagy, phagosome, thiamine metabolism, n-glycan biosynthesis, methane metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and protein export pathways . genes involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and the citrate cycle were down-regulated . these results described the metabolic characteristics of heterologous protein production of p. pastoris with methanol induction. carbon shift from glycerol to methanol is an important process in heterologous protein expression. the genes involved in the methanol utilization pathway were markedly up-regulated under sdem conditions, similar to the adaptation of hansenula polymorpha to methanol  <cit> . alcohol oxidases  were up-regulated by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively; they catalyze the methanol to formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide reaction as the first step of the methanol utilization pathway. other related genes, such as catalase , formaldehyde dehydrogenase , and s-formyl glutathione hydrolase , were also highly expressed . for glycerol metabolism, p. pastoris homologs of s. cerevisiae putative passive glycerol channel  and the active glycerol importer  decreased significantly at the transcriptional level after the carbon shift from glycerol to methanol. cytosolic glycerol kinase  was also down-regulated because of the lack of glycerol supply.

another significantly up-regulated gene group was vitamin metabolism. as an important vitamin, thiamine can be synthesized from hydroxylmethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate and hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate by tmp synthase. all thiamine-regulated genes in p. pastoris were induced on the carbon shift from glycerol to methanol , which was consistent with the circumstances in the batch fermentation at ph <dig> or ph <dig>  <cit> . the up-regulation of these genes may be due to the activation of tpp riboswitches  <cit> .

p. pastoris needs many more peroxisomes to resist the toxicity of methanol when methanol is the sole carbon source. in the sdem culture, almost all of the genes controlling the development and the function of the peroxisome were up-regulated compared with the sdeg culture . peroxisome proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytoplasm, and then imported into peroxisomes. two peroxisomal targeting signal genes  are essential for sorting proteins to this organelle. pex <dig> and pex <dig> encode receptors for pts <dig> and pts <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the expression level of pex <dig> was much higher than that of pex <dig>  consistent with only a limited number of peroxisomal matrix proteins containing the pts <dig> receptor  <cit> . both pex <dig> and pex <dig>  which act in the terminal step of the peroxisomal matrix protein import  <cit>  and participate in the recycling of peroxisomal signal receptors, were up-regulated, indicating that the requirement for importing matrix proteins to peroxisomes was strong. the most up-regulated peroxisome gene was pex <dig> , which is implicated in regulating peroxisome proliferation. the up-regulation of pex <dig> was consistent with previous findings in baker’s yeast  <cit>  and h. polymorpha <cit>  cultivated with peroxisome-inducing carbon sources. it is thought that pex <dig> also participates in the β-oxidation of fatty acids  <cit> . pex <dig>  together with the genes related to β-oxidation of fatty acids, is induced in h. polymorpha by the carbon shift from glucose to methanol  <cit> , but their expression levels are down-regulated in p. pastoris under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . surprisingly, pex <dig> was induced while the genes related to β-oxidation of fatty acids  were down-regulated in our rna-seq data under methanol conditions. the reason for this difference remains unclear and needs further investigation.

in addition to glycerol metabolism, transcriptional regulation was the main biological process enriched in the down-regulated genes  when methanol was the sole carbon source. down-regulation of genes encoding transcription factors  was detected. it has been reported that the lower specific growth rate resulted in the down-regulation of genes related to ribosomal synthesis when the carbon source is changed from glycerol to methanol in recombinant p. pastoris <cit> . analogously, reduced transcriptional regulation would be due to the lower growth rate under methanol conditions in h. polymorpha <cit> . a lower growth rate could not explain the reduced transcriptional regulation in this study because of the chemostat culture, suggesting that p. pastoris may be prone to reduce the transcription of some less important genes to supply enough energy and substrates for expression of the heterologous gene .

CONCLUSIONS
with high resolution and unprecedented throughput , the global transcriptome of p. pastoris was accurately annotated under the cells growth with glycerol as the substrate and the protein expression using methanol as an inducer and substrate. internal ribosome entry sites were identified in the 5’-utrs of kog <dig> and gcn <dig>  indicating that the ires-dependent translation initiation also exists in p. pastoris. differential expression analysis provided rich information for further in-depth studies of the translation initiation mechanism, protein expression and secretion mechanisms in p. pastoris. these results will be very useful in the further bioprocess engineering and optimization of induced conditions of p. pastoris.

materials and methods
strains and vectors
the strains used for rna-seq are summarized in table  <dig>  p. pastoris gs <dig> , a histidine auxotrophic strain, was used as the host strain for the construction of recombinant strains. the secretory expression plasmid ppic9k-rml was constructed by inserting the coding sequence of the r. miehei lipase gene  into the vector ppic9k . similarly, the surface display vector for the rml gene  was obtained by inserting the fusion gene rml-α-agglutinin into the plasmid ppic9k. the secretion signal peptide α-factor of ppic9k and α-agglutinin were used as the secretion signal and the anchor protein for the cell surface display of rml protein in p. pastoris. additionally, strain gs115/pk, which contains the vector ppic9k without heterologous genes, was used as a control. each p. pastoris strain was integrated with a single copy number of the respective plasmid.

chemostat cultivation
chemostat cultivation was used throughout this study, providing constant environmental conditions to ensure that the yeast cultures for transcriptome analysis would be reproducible, reliable, and biologically homogeneous. to obtain seed cultures for chemostat cultivation, single colonies on fresh ypd plates  were inoculated directly into  <dig> ml shake flasks containing  <dig> ml ypd liquid culture medium. after cultivation at 28°c for approximately  <dig> h with agitation , seed cultures were used to inoculate the starting volume  of the bioreactor to an optical density  of  <dig> . the chemostat cultivations, consisting of batch cell growth  and continuous culture with glycerol or methanol feeding, were performed in a  <dig>  l working volume bioreactor under computer-based process control.

batch cultivations were performed in basal salt medium, containing :  <dig>  ml h3po <dig> ,  <dig>  g caso <dig>   <dig>  g k2so <dig>   <dig>  g mgso4·7h2o,  <dig>  g koh,  <dig>  g glycerol,  <dig>  ml antifoam, and  <dig>  ml trace salt stock solution. trace salt stock solution contained :  <dig>  g cuso4·5h2o,  <dig>  g nai,  <dig>  g mnso4·h2o,  <dig>  g na2moo4·2h2o,  <dig>  g h3bo <dig>   <dig>  g cocl <dig>   <dig>  g zncl <dig>   <dig>  g feso4·7h2o,  <dig>  g biotin, and  <dig>  ml of h2so <dig>  the cultivation temperature was 28°c with a ph of  <dig> , controlled with 25% ammonium hydroxide. the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained above 20% saturation by altering the stirrer speed between  <dig> and  <dig> rpm, while the airflow was kept constant at  <dig>  vvm.

after approximately  <dig> h, the batch finished and the continuous culture started at a dilution rate of d =  <dig>  h- <dig>  the chemostat medium contained :  <dig>  ml h3po <dig> ,  <dig>  g caso <dig>   <dig>  g k2so <dig>   <dig>  g mgso4·7h2o,  <dig>  g koh,  <dig>  g methanol or glycerol,  <dig>  ml antifoam, and  <dig>  ml trace salt stock solution. the continuous culture was performed for at least five resident times to reach steady-state conditions.

rna sequencing
for illumina sequencing, total rna was extracted from each sample using the hot acidic phenol method and then treated with rnase-free dnase i  for  <dig> min according to the manufacturer’s protocol. the integrity of the total rna was analyzed using an agilent technologies  <dig> bioanalyzer, and all six samples were shown to have an rna integrity number  value >  <dig>  the poly-enriched mrna was purified using sera-mag magnetic oligo beads  from  <dig> mg total rna method described by wang et al  <cit> . the cdna library products were sequenced using the  <dig> g illumina genome analyzer at the beijing genomics institute, shenzhen. two biological replicates of sdem and sdeg were analyzed. the raw sequencing data are deposited in sra  <cit>  at ncbi with accession number sra <dig> 

read mapping in the reference genome and genes
the p. pastoris gs <dig> genome and gene information were downloaded from the p. pastoris genome database  <cit> . after removing the reads containing sequencing adapters and reads of low quality , the remaining reads were aligned to the p. pastoris genome using soap <dig>  <cit> , allowing up to 5-base mismatches. the reads that failed to be mapped were progressively trimmed off one base at a time from the 3’-end and mapped to the genome again until a match was observed . for paired-end reads, the insert between paired reads was set from  <dig> base to  <dig> kilobases, allowing them to span introns of varying sizes in the genome. the same strategy was used for aligning paired-end reads to the non-redundant gene, except the insert was changed from  <dig> base to  <dig> kilobases.

normalized gene expression using rna-seq
the gene expression level was normalized by the number of reads per kilobase of exon region per million mapped reads   <cit> . the cutoff value for determining gene transcriptional activity was determined based on a 95% confidence interval for all rpkm values of each gene. that is to say, the genes with an expression level in the lowest 5% were discarded.

novel transcripts
a novel transcriptional active region  was determined in the intergenic regions by contiguous expression with each base supported by at least two uniquely mapped reads and a length >  <dig> bp. supported by paired-end information, a novel transcript unit  was constructed by connectivity between novel tars that were joined by at least three paired reads. novel tus with length <  <dig> bp or average expression of <  <dig> reads per base were excluded from further analysis. furthermore, the sequences of the novel transcripts were analyzed by orf finder in ncbi.

utr analysis
to define the utrs of the annotated genes, we searched for a break in the transcribed region around the genes, denoted by positions with read counts of  <dig>  starting from either end of genes. genes where ends overlapped with other genes were excluded from the analysis. if no break was found, the utr was discarded.

upstream open reading frames  and alternative upstream initiation codons  were screened in the 5’-utrs using computational methods. any uorf of length >  <dig> bp or with a distance between the uorf and the gene start codon >  <dig> bp was excluded from the results. the length between the uatg and the gene’s coding region should be <  <dig> bp, uatgs must be in-frame with the gene’s coding region, and there should be no stop codon in the uatg sequence.

analysis of ires activity in 5’-utr
for ires analysis, a set of bicistronic vectors was constructed . the upstream cistron  and the downstream cistron  were cloned into the plasmid pgapzαa , designated as the negative control plasmid, prml-lacz. subsequently, the selected 5’-utrs were amplified from p. pastoris cdna and inserted between the two cistrons. the recombinant vectors were confirmed by dna sequencing and transformed into p. pastoris x <dig>  together with the host p. pastoris x <dig>  positive recombinant strains were cultivated on mdt plates 2so <dig>   <dig> g/l yeast extract,  <dig> g/l polyvinyl alcohol ,  <dig> g/l agar,  <dig> ml/l tributyrin  and  <dig> ml/l  <dig> m phosphate buffer solution, ph  <dig> ) and mdx plates 2so <dig>   <dig> g/l yeast extract,  <dig> g/l agar,  <dig> ml/l x-gal solution  and  <dig> ml/l  <dig> m phosphate buffer solution, ph  <dig> ) to detect expression of the rml and β-galactosidase genes, respectively. to assess the integrity of the bicistronic mrnas, pcr identification was performed with the corresponding cdna as the template.

northern blot analysis
p. pastoris strains x33/prml-lacz, x33/prml-gcn2-lacz, x33/prml-kog1-lacz, and x33/placz were cultivated in ypd  for  <dig> h. total rna was isolated using the hot acidic phenol method and then denatured in a mixture of 50% formamide ,  <dig> mm morpholinepropane sulfonic acid  and  <dig>  m formaldehyde for  <dig> min at 65°c and chilled on ice. rna was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing  <dig>  m formaldehyde and  <dig> mm mops and transferred onto a nylon membrane , on which they were cross-linked by uv. the preparation of the lacz probe and subsequent hybridizations were performed using express hyb  according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

gene ontology analysis
we obtained the go terms of each p. pastoris gene with the blast2go software   <cit>  using default parameters. blast2go was also used for go functional enrichment analysis of certain genes, performing fisher’s exact test with a robust false discovery rate  correction to obtain an adjusted p-value between certain test gene groups and the whole annotation.

analysis of alternative splicing  events
to identify all potential splice sites, we searched for the putative donor site  and the acceptor site  inside intronic regions and required that a novel splice site was to be supported by at least one uniquely mapped read. we then enumerated all the possible pairs of donor sites and acceptor sites to detect potential splice junctions.

to determine the number of reads supporting each splice junction, all reads that could not be matched to the genome and that could be matched by trimming off several terminal bases were retrieved and aligned against the junction sequence with a tolerance of  <dig> bp mismatches. a proposed junction site was required to be supported by at least two unambiguous mapped reads with different match positions within the splice junction region and also with a minimum match of five bases on each side of the junction .

to identify as events in p. pastoris, the junction sequences identified were used to analyze seven types of as events including se, ri, a5ss, a3ss, mxe, afe and ale according to the method of wang  <cit> .

analysis of differential gene expression under heterologous protein production conditions
two biological replicates of sdeg and sdem were used to analyze differentially expressed genes under culture conditions as in the description above, using the ‘r’ package   <cit> , based on the read count of each gene under methanol or glycerol conditions. go functional enrichment analysis was performed using the blast2go software and kegg pathway analysis was performed using the cytoscape software   <cit> .

validation of rna-seq analysis
novel transcripts and new exons were validated by rt-pcr with primers designed in the exon regions . to detect different as isoforms, real-time quantitative pcr  was performed using primers designed inside exons or introns . the p. pastoris samples were the same as those for the illumina sequencing. after extraction using the hot acidic phenol method, total rna was treated with rnase-free dnase i  for  <dig> min according to the manufacturer’s protocol. subsequently, first-strand cdna synthesis and qpcr were performed using the primescript™ rt-pcr kit  and the sybr premix ex taq ii™ kit . for the negative control, the reverse transcriptase was omitted in the cdna synthesis reaction with the dnase-treated total rna as the template. no pcr product was obtained using the negative control as the template, suggesting that the genomic dna was removed completed.
