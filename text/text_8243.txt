BACKGROUND
approximately one-half of our body consists of skeletal muscle, which is responsible for executing every single action we undertake  <cit> . skeletal muscle has the ability to regenerate in response to damage by activating satellite cells resting beneath the basal lamina of adult skeletal muscle  <cit> . however, this specific regeneration capacity is limited to only small wounds, whereas volumetric muscle loss caused by trauma or surgery requires remarkable efforts, such as free autologous muscle flap transplantation, which always come along with inevitable morbidity at the donor site . this is where skeletal muscle tissue engineering  might be a future goal, trying to mimic the structure and function of skeletal muscle .

for successfully generating muscle tissue in vivo, not only easily expandable cells but also a suitable biocompatible matrix needs to be generated. muscle satellite cells offer the best characteristics for muscle te, being capable of self-renewal and regeneration upon a variety of stimuli  <cit> . however, multiple passaging decreases their differentiation capacity making their clinical applicability as single cell source difficult  <cit> . mesenchymal stem cells  from the bone marrow may represent a promising alternative cell source for muscle te since they can easily be harvested, expanded widely without losing their differentiation ability and autologous transplantation for future clinical applications does not come along with any risk of rejection  <cit> . it has been described that mscs can be differentiated towards the myogenic lineage by expressing muscle specific markers, even though their myogenic potential is limited . myogenic differentiation of mscs alone might not be sufficiently satisfying, but they still represent an attractive cell source for co-cultivation with myoblasts. the application of mscs co-cultivated with myoblasts has previously been investigated and it was shown that mscs are able to fuse with myoblasts and contribute to the muscle regeneration process  <cit> . moreover, it has been demonstrated that the addition of human mscs to skeletal myoblasts cell-sheet in the ischemic cardiomyopathy model intensifies the release of different cytokines such as hgf and vegf  <cit> . mscs are not only known to secrete several growth factors involved in the muscle regeneration process such as basic fibroblast growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor  or insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , but they also stimulate myoblast migration, proliferation, differentiation and cell survival upon co-cultivation  <cit> . previous studies showed that stimulation with different supplements such as bfgf and dexamethasone potentiates msc and myoblast differentiation capacity  <cit> . however, the effects of hgf and igf- <dig> regarding the myogenic differentiation of msc and myoblast co-cultures still require further investigation. it is well known that hgf activates satellite cells binding to the c-met tyrosine kinase receptor and stimulating different downstream targets  <cit> . while hgf primarily induces the proliferation of satellite cells, igf- <dig> both activates proliferation and differentiation through binding to the igf- <dig> receptor   <cit> . the majority of circulating igf- <dig> is bound to specific igf-binding proteins , a family of secreted proteins binding igf- <dig> with greater affinity than igf- <dig> r  <cit> . there are different isoforms of igfbps and their exact roles are not clarified yet: while igfbp <dig> mostly inhibits igf stimulation, igfbp <dig> acts through and independently of igf and can therefore even potentiate or inhibit myogenic differentiation, and igfbp <dig> is mostly expressed in proliferating cells  <cit> .

as mentioned above, successful generation of skeletal muscle needs both a suitable cell source as well as a biocompatible matrix. for optimally mimicking the in vivo structure of skeletal muscle and creating an applicable system for te, a three-dimensional  construct is needed. different matrices have been studied for muscle te applications, e.g. heher et al. developed aligned fibrin fibrils in a 3d scaffold by applying static mechanical strain, demonstrating aligned myotube formation of myogenic precursor cells  <cit> . further, choi et al. demonstrated that cultivation of human skeletal muscle cells on unidirectional electrospun poly-ε-caprolacton -collagen nanofiber meshes enhances myotube formation as well as skeletal muscle cell organization  <cit> . in previous studies, comparing fibrin-collagen-i gels with electrospun collagen nanofibers, good proliferation as well as differentiation of myoblasts could be shown, with parallel oriented nanofibers representing the most promising matrix  <cit> .

one aim of this study is to investigate the influence of different concentrations as well as the combination of hgf and igf- <dig> on myogenesis using co-cultures of mscs and myoblasts as well as msc monocultures. the three major myogenic key differentiation markers analysed in this study are, amongst others, myocyte enhancer factor  <dig> , myosin heavy chain  <dig>  and alpha-sarcomeric actinin . mef <dig> is a transcription factor, which interacts with members of the myod family of basic helix–loop–helix  proteins to activate the skeletal muscle differentiation program. it plays a central role in activating pathways responsible for cell division, differentiation and death  <cit> . mef <dig> is upregulated especially when cells enter the differentiation pathway and required in response to injury for adult myogenesis . however mef <dig> seems to play a crucial role in myogenesis, its effects on msc myoblast co-cultures have not been investigated profoundly so far. actn <dig>  a cytoskeletal protein, stabilises the muscle contractile apparatus and is essential for developing the sarcomere. such is, myhc <dig>  which constitutes sarcomere thick filaments and functions as a molecular motor protein in skeletal muscle. both factors are indispensable for the formation of differentiated skeletal muscle . their expression is proof for generating skeletal muscle. even though, their behaviour concerning myogenic differentiation in msc and myoblast co-cultures is not sufficiently studied and therefore of high interest.

we further analysed the behaviour of msc-myoblast co-cultures in 3d fibrin and fibrin-collagen-i gels, especially in light of myogenic differentiation. as a final step, parallel-aligned electrospun pcl-collagen-i nanofibers were developed and cultivated with msc-myoblast co-cultures stimulated with hgf and igf- <dig> for testing the applicability for future in vivo studies.

cell culture in 3d fibrin and fibrin-collagen-i gels
fibrinogen and thrombin  were dissolved according to the manufacturer’s instructions. collagen  for the fibrin-collagen gels was equilibrated to ph  <dig> prior to use. a co-culture of  <dig>  cm-dii  labelled rat myoblasts and gfp-transduced rat mscs at a ratio of 1: <dig> was mixed with either a fibrinogen-medium solution or fibrinogen-collagen-medium solution. cell suspensions were mixed 1: <dig> with thrombin  in a 24-well plate. each gel had a total volume of 700 μl with a fibrin concentration of either  <dig>  or 5 mg/ml. in the fibrin-collagen gels the collagen concentration was  <dig>  mg/ml. the gels were finally covered with 400 μl of differentiation medium containing  <dig>  tiu/ml aprotinin. after  <dig> and  <dig> d, gels were frozen in liquid nitrogen and minced with mortar and electrical mixer . gels were further homogenised with trizol  and chloroform, and rna was purified as described previously. a differentiation medium with and without hgf/igf- <dig> was used.

electrospinning of pcl-collagen-i nanofibers and cell seeding
pcl  was dissolved at a ratio of 2: <dig> with bovine collagen type  <dig>  in ethanol  90% at a concentration of 10% w/v . parallel nanofibers were electrospun on a counter electrode consisting of two parallel arranged beams  on a standard electrospinning machine . afterwards, fibres were collected from the beams using glass plates . nanofibers were electrospun with a voltage of 20 kv and a flow rate of 1 ml/h. twelve hours before cell seeding, probes sterilised in 70% ethanol, washed with pbs afterwards and soaked in dmem ham’s f- <dig> for approximately 1 h at 37 °c. scaffolds were seeded with 100 μl expansion medium containing  <dig>  mscs and myoblasts at a ratio of 1: <dig>  after an incubation time of 3 h at 37 °c, wells were filled with 1 ml of expansion medium. after 24 h, scaffolds were transferred into new well plates and stimulated with basic differentiation medium containing hgf and igf- <dig> for  <dig> d. to analyse cell morphology and orientation, scanning electron microscopy and phase contrast microscopy  was used.

statistical analysis
data are expressed as a mean–standard deviation. statistical analysis was performed using spss  <dig>  for windows .

results were statistically interpreted by one-way analysis of variance  and tukey hsd test as a post hoc test. normal distribution was confirmed using the shapiro wilk test. in the case of no normal distribution, the nonparametric kruskal-wallis test and the mann-whitney u-test were used. for comparing samples over different time points, anova for repeated measurements was used.

the level of statistical significance was set to p ≤  <dig> . a p-value ≤  <dig>  was considered to be highly significant.

discussion
the aim of this study was to examine the effects of hgf and igf- <dig> on msc and myoblast co-cultures, as well as monocultures, and to investigate the cell–cell interactions in a 3d-matrix.

time-dependent effect of hgf and igf- <dig> on myogenic differentiation of mono- and co-cultures
we investigated the influence of different concentrations of hgf and igf- <dig> on msc and myoblast co-cultures, as well as monocultures, compared with cells cultivated in hgf/igf- <dig> free medium, analysing mef <dig> and actn <dig> expression. due to sometimes high standard deviations, some of the comparisons showed no statistically significant differences. an explanation for higher standard deviations might be that sometimes we could only isolate small amounts of rna that perhaps do not fully reflect the total rna of the analysed group and therefore caused variation among the experiments.

in our study, stimulation with different concentrations of the growth factors, revealed, especially under hgf, no clear trend regarding the expression of myogenic markers. it is well known that hgf both plays a role in proliferation as well as differentiation of skeletal muscle cells  <cit> . yamada et al. described low expression of myogenin mrna under  <dig>  ng/ml as well as under extremely high  hgf concentrations, suggesting decreased myogenic differentiation  <cit> . walker et al. detected decreased myosin heavy chain expression under 2 ng/ml hgf, but increased levels at 10 ng/ml, while gal-levi et al. showed lower myhc levels with increased hgf concentrations   <cit> . a variety of studies have been made, trying to define the influence of different concentrations of hgf on skeletal muscle development, which has not been clarified yet.

in our study, early stimulation with hgf or igf- <dig> achieved almost equal or increased levels of mef <dig> and actn <dig> in co-cultures and myoblast monocultures, under all concentrations. focussing on the temporal course, mef <dig> expression decreased significantly and highly significantly under hgf and igf- <dig> influence in co-cultures. according to previously published findings, it may be suggested that too high concentrations of either of the added growth factors could negatively influence myogenic differentiation . differences were detected regarding msc monocultures: especially long-term stimulation with hgf resulted in higher myogenic marker expression compared with unstimulated controls. during early stimulation in mscs, only 30 ng/ml hgf achieved elevated levels of mef <dig> compared to unstimulated controls, being opposite to the other groups. regarding that the result was not statistically significant, together with a high range of standard deviation and the fact that sometimes only small amounts of rna could be isolated, these results might be of limited reliability. furthermore, igf- <dig> stimulation did not increase mef <dig> at all and actn <dig> only during early time points. comparing the level of myogenic differentiation amongst the three different cell groups, the co-cultures and msc monocultures showed lower levels of myogenic marker expressions compared with myoblast monocultures, especially during early growth factor stimulation. the requirement of longer differentiation time periods for mscs might be a possible explanation for lower myogenic marker expression during early time points. this is in accordance with previously published work, in which time periods up to 6 weeks were used  <cit> . expression of mef <dig> and actn <dig> leads towards the formation of skeletal muscle .

beginning myogenic differentiation of mscs upon co-cultivation with myoblasts and under igf- <dig> stimulation
we further analysed the effect of combined stimulation with hgf + igf- <dig> compared with hgf or igf- <dig> only, as well as under unstimulated conditions in a basal differentiation medium containing dhs, l-glutamin, dexamethasone and bfgf . co-cultures and msc monocultures were directly related to myoblast monocultures. during early stimulation, mscs showed overall higher levels of des compared with co-cultures, probably because of desmin being a msc marker  <cit> . myog expression could only be detected in one out of three experiments and was limited to co-cultures, with highest levels under hgf stimulation. long-term stimulation with igf- <dig> showed increased levels of actn <dig> and myhc <dig> in co-cultures, higher than in msc and myoblast monocultures, indicating that mscs might need longer differentiation periods  <cit> . cell–cell contact between myoblasts and mscs could be a possible explanation for increased myogenic marker expression in co-cultures, comparable to previous findings by beier et al., in which elevated levels of mef <dig> and actn <dig> were detected upon direct co-cultivation of mscs and myoblasts  <cit> . in previous studies it has been described that msc influence myoblast differentiation in a paracrine way  <cit> .

with multicolour flow cytometry, the myogenic differentiation on a protein level was further analysed. elevated levels of mef <dig> and actn <dig> were detected in co-cultures and msc monocultures after  <dig> d of stimulation with hgf + igf- <dig> as well as in unstimulated controls indicating an increasing myogenic differentiation . under fluorescence microscopy, positive staining for myhc <dig>  part of the myosin motor protein and therefore responsible for skeletal muscle contraction, revealed further myogenic differentiation  <cit> . through stable transduced gfp expression, it was possible to detect the involvement of mscs in the formation of multinucleated cells . cultivation in hgf/igf- <dig> free medium almost always achieved similar levels of myogenic differentiation than under hgf + igf- <dig> stimulation. we were not able to detect significant differences between our stimulation and controls groups. based on this observation, these growth factors may not necessarily be needed for sufficient myogenic differentiation  <cit> . but then – what might be the explanation for adequate myogenic differentiation in hgf/igf- <dig> free environment? first of all, our hgf/igf- <dig> free medium  contains already dexamethasone and bfgf, two factors known to influence myogenic differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, as mentioned earlier, both msc and myoblasts are known to secrete several growth factors involved in the muscle regeneration process  <cit> . herein, autocrine and paracrine stimulation might lead to myogenic differentiation. nonetheless, successful muscle generation depends on more than secreted factors: cell-cell contact is crucial for a satisfactory differentiation. previous works by singaravelu and padanilam compared the differentiation of msc in conditioned medium with co-cultivation of msc and injured renal cells. cultivation in conditioned medium did not induce differentiation, but co-cultivation led to differentiation  <cit> .

in summary, we successfully differentiated mscs into the myogenic lineage both under hgf/igf- <dig> stimulation and in a control medium, compared with myoblasts on the mrna level  as well as after  <dig> d on the protein level . upon co-cultivation with myoblasts and under igf- <dig> stimulation, additional expression of key myogenic marker myhc <dig> could be detected.

comparing the myogenic potential of mscs upon co-cultivation with myoblasts with msc monocultures could be a promising future prospect. we already tried to separate mscs by their gfp signal with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, but the yield was not enough for further analysis. in future experiments, it may be possible to sort mscs for evaluation of myogenic potential cultivated in co- compared with monocultures, using higher cell numbers. furthermore, only very low levels of myog could be detected in co-cultures in our study. msc monocultures did not express myog at any time point. because myogenin is mostly expressed during terminal stages of myogenic differentiation  <cit> , longer cultivation periods of at least up to  <dig> d would be one future goal. although cell detachment after  <dig> d of cultivation made it impossible to analyse the gene expression during longer observation periods so far, coating with collagen type i or maxgel™  may be a possibility to overcome cell detachment in future experiments  <cit> . furthermore, myogenin is known to peak at some point of myoblast differentiation and then decline to lower expression afterwards. by the time we analysed myogenin expression, it might be possible that its expression was already starting to decline  <cit> .

possible involvement of igfbps in myogenic differentiation
igfbps are a family of secreted proteins binding igf- <dig> and either potentiating or inhibiting igf- <dig> actions on myogenic differentiation  <cit> . in our study, in co-cultures, increased expression of igfbp <dig>  -  <dig> and - <dig> goes along with higher actn <dig> and myhc <dig> expression under igf- <dig> stimulation compared with myoblasts and msc monocultures, accompanied by lower expressions of des and myog . igfbp <dig> and - <dig> showed a similar expression pattern amongst all conditions in co-cultures, suggesting that these genes might have equal effects on myogenic differentiation and are regulated alike. furthermore, the expression of myhc <dig> and actn <dig> appears to correlate with igfbp <dig> and - <dig> in co-cultures, indicating that they might have a positive influence on the expression of those myogenic markers.

in msc monocultures both under hgf + igf- <dig> and hgf stimulation, elevated levels of igfbp <dig> as well as actn <dig> were observed compared with co-cultures and myoblast controls, whereas igfbp <dig>  - <dig> and myhc <dig> expressions were almost undetectable.

depending on the culture conditions , growth factor stimulation and the analysed myogenic markers, different effects could be detected. in co-cultures under igf- <dig>  increased expression of igfbps was observed together with elevated levels of actn <dig> and myhc <dig>  and msc monocultures showed different results under the same conditions. hence, the function of the different igfbps might vary among different surrounding conditions. so far, we presume that igfbps play a role during myogenic differentiation.

even though there is still no uniform opinion concerning the exact function of the igfbps, igfbp <dig> was both identified as a positive influencer during muscle regeneration and as a potent inhibitor of muscle growth and igf- <dig> actions  <cit> . igfbp <dig> could inhibit igf- <dig> actions, potentiate igf- <dig> effects or act in an igf-independent way  <cit> . igfbp <dig> may not act primarily during the myogenic differentiation process  <cit> .

using elisa or western blot, the concentrations of igfbps in the cell lysate or the supernatant could be estimated more precisely. inhibiting igfbps through igfbp antibodies could be another approach to gain more information about these binding proteins and their effects on igf- <dig> and myogenic differentiation.

three-dimensional environment enhances myogenic differentiation of mscs and myoblasts
regarding the matrix evolution in te, we previously demonstrated that 3d collagen-i gels had a stimulatory effect on myoblasts  <cit> . according to these findings, we investigated the effect of 3d systems on co-cultures of mscs and myoblasts with hgf + igf- <dig>  and observed a strong upregulation of myogenic key markers compared with unstimulated groups. however, fibrin-collagen-i gels cannot provide the needed spatial orientation for muscle tissue. therefore, we developed an electrospun, parallel-aligned, pcl-collagen-i nanofiber scaffold as the basis for further generation of muscle tissue. parallel alignment of fibres stimulates myotube formation, and the combination of pcl and collagen provides strength, elasticity and compliance, which is essential for the formation of functional tissue  <cit> . cultivating mscs and myoblasts on parallel-oriented pcl-collagen-i nanofibers and stimulating with hgf + igf- <dig> for  <dig> d leads to parallel alignment of the cells in this study, indicating that this scaffold is a promising matrix for generation of muscle tissue in vitro. jana et al. cultivated c2c <dig> myoblasts on aligned chitosan-pcl hybrid nanofiber scaffolds, showing formation of a compact assembly of myotube cells  <cit> . zhao et al. used aligned electrospun pcl/collagen hybrid scaffolds for diaphragmatic repair in rats, demonstrating muscle cell migration and tissue formation  <cit> . for further investigation of our results in vivo, the newly developed arteriovenous loop model combined with nervous innervation through the saphenous nerve might offer a promising possibility for the functionalization of skeletal muscle  <cit> .

although promising results for engineering of vascularised tissue have already been achieved in the case of bone reconstruction  <cit> , free autologous muscle flap transplantation still remains the gold standard for muscle reconstruction, in particular for complex soft tissue defects  <cit> . however, in the future, te of skeletal muscle may help to overcome the donor site problem of harvesting large muscles of the human body.

CONCLUSIONS
the generation of functional skeletal muscle tissue for future in vivo applications is still challenging. in this study we demonstrated that mscs in monocultures and in co-cultivation with myoblasts are able to differentiate into the myogenic lineage by expressing key myogenic markers such as desmin, mef <dig>  myhc <dig> and actn <dig>  stimulation with hgf and igf- <dig> induces an upregulation of different myogenic markers, but probably is not essential for myogenic differentiation. igfbps play a role during myogenic differentiation, varying amongst culture and stimulation conditions. three-dimensional cultivation of co-cultures enhances the myogenic differentiation capacity. pcl-collagen nanofibers especially represent a promising scaffold, mimicking the structure of skeletal muscle and inducing parallel alignment of mscs and myoblasts. the results of this study represent important starting points for future studies and in vivo applications for the te of skeletal muscle.
