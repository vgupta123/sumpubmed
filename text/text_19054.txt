BACKGROUND
trichome patterning in arabidopsis thaliana has become a well-studied model system to understand cell-cell communication in the context of two-dimensional pattern formation in plants  <cit> . trichomes are formed in the basal part of young leaves  <cit> . the trichome position is not correlated with any recognizable leaf structures and clonal analysis excluded a cell lineage mechanism  <cit> . for these reasons, it is widely accepted that patterning is mediated by cellular interactions between initially equivalent cells  <cit> .

genetic screens have identified two classes of mutants governing this process. all patterning genes except for ttg <dig> have close homologs acting in a partially redundant manner  <cit> . the following summary will only consider the most relevant players as judged by the strength of the mutant phenotypes. one mutant class shows fewer or no trichomes. the corresponding genes are therefore considered positive regulators of trichome formation. the three most important positive regulators are the wd <dig> protein transparent testa glabra <dig>   <cit> , the r2r <dig> myb related transcription factor glabra <dig>   <cit> , and the basic helix-loop-helix -like transcription factor glabra <dig>   <cit> .

in the second class, trichome clusters or a higher trichome density indicate a repressive role. the two most important inhibitors are the r <dig> single-repeat myb factors triptychon  and caprice   <cit> . although, the two corresponding genes show high sequence similarity and an indistinguishable expression pattern in leaves  <cit> , their mutant phenotypes suggest different modes of action. while the cpc mutant has a higher trichome density, the try mutant shows trichome clusters and a reduction in trichome number  <cit> .

the expression pattern of most patterning genes is very similar. initially, all genes are expressed ubiquitously in the cells at the leaf basis where trichome initials are formed . later, expression increases in trichomes and disappears in epidermal cells  <cit> . the ubiquitous expression corresponds to the pre-pattern situation in which all cells are equivalent. during this phase the positive and negative regulators are considered to be engaged in regulatory feed-back loops that have several important features including the activation of the inhibitors by the activators, the repression of the activators by the inhibitors and the ability of the inhibitors to move between cells  <cit> . these create differences between the cells and ultimately result in a pattern of trichome and non-trichome cells  <cit> .

after the initial pattern is established leaf growth leads to an increased spacing of trichomes without the formation of new trichomes. as in this phase patterning gene expression has ceased in epidermal pavement cells and increased in trichomes, the loss of trichome initiation competence is most likely due to the absence of activator gene expression. whether activator gene expression in later leaf stages is generally shut off during leaf maturation or due to lateral repression by try and/or the other inhibitors is not clear.

the proposed regulatory feedback loop between the activators and the inhibitors ultimately leads to an auto-repression of the inhibitors. this could in principle be achieved in two ways. as the r <dig> single repeat myb inhibitors lack a transcriptional activation region they could bind to promoter elements of the activators thereby preventing the transcription of the activators. as the repressors are activated by the activators the reduction of activator activity leads to reduced inhibitor transcription. alternatively, the inhibitors could posttranslationally render the activation complex inactive  <cit> . yeast two hybrid experiments showed that gl <dig> and ttg <dig> bind different regions of the gl <dig> protein suggesting that they form a trimeric transcriptional activation complex  <cit> . binding of try or cpc to gl <dig> was shown to displace gl <dig> thereby inactivating the complex  <cit> . although both mechanisms lead to a repression of the inhibitors they differ in their regulation scheme. the transcriptional repression of the activators by binding of try and/or cpc to the promoters would create a regulatory feed back loop that involves transcriptional down regulation of the activators. the postulated repression by differential complex formation would establish a shortcut of the regulatory feedback loop as the inhibitors can directly repress their own activation.

in this manuscript, we analyze the transcriptional regulation of try during trichome patterning. first, we determined the try promoter fragment relevant for try function and the specific basal and trichome-specific expression pattern. in addition we identified separate regions that are necessary for an enhancement of the specific expression pattern and showed that these regions are necessary for rescue. second, we showed that try or cpc can repress the try expression directly without the transcriptional regulation of the activators by transforming single epidermal cells of ptry:gus lines with the three activators and try or cpc. finally, we performed promoter swap experiments with cpc and try and tested the ability to rescue the try mutant trichome phenotypes. these experiments revealed specific properties of the try protein for clustering and trichome density regulation.

RESULTS
in a previous study, it was shown that a  <dig>  kb genomic region containing a  <dig>  kb 5' region and a  <dig>  kb 3' region is sufficient to rescue the try mutant phenotype  <cit> . in a first step, we tested whether the 3' region or the introns are relevant for try function by transforming try mutant plants with a  <dig>  kb 5' region that was fused to the try cds . these plants showed complete rescue of the clustering phenotype indicating that the  <dig>  kb 5' region contains all regulatory sequences necessary for the correct try expression in the leaf epidermis.

expression analysis of try promoter fragments
to identify specific regulatory elements, 5' promoter fragments were generated and their regulatory function monitored by fusion to the p35s-minimal promoter and the gus marker gene . because expression of a given construct is variable between different t <dig> lines we present pictures of the lines with the strongest expression only  and provide the percentage of lines in which the basal expression as well as trichome expression and those in which only the trichome specific expression is found after  <dig> hours of gus staining . assuming that promoter elements driving a weak expression yield fewer transgenic lines with a strong expression this percentage is taken as an approximation of the expression strength of the promoter fragment under consideration.

for the expression analysis we initially used a fragment starting immediately upstream of an unique putative tata box located  <dig> base pairs upstream of the possible transcription start as determined by race pcr  <cit>  . this fragment revealed gus expression in trichomes, but the ubiquitous expression in young leaf regions  observed before  <cit>  was absent . we therefore included the fragment immediately following the a-fragment and stretching to the - <dig> position relative to the atg start codon . ptry-b represents the 5' utr identified by schellmann et al. and includes three possible transcriptional start sides suggested by ests  and two putative tata boxes   <cit> . a promoter fragment, ptry-a, b, combining ptry-a and ptry-b revealed also trichome specific expression in  <dig> % of the lines but in addition  <dig> % of the lines  showed the basal expression as well as the expression in trichomes. the ptry-b fragment alone showed no expression. this indicates that the ptry-b fragment is essential to enhance or stabilize the expression driven by the ptry-a fragment.

a further deletion series revealed a minimal promoter region of about  <dig> bp . as found for the ptry-a fragment the ptry-b region is also necessary in the context of the ptry-a <dig> fragment to mediate basal expression . further 5' deletion of about  <dig> bp  revealed trichome specific expression but only weak basal expression. trichome-specific expression in these lines was only found in advanced stages of trichome development after branch formation . the  <dig> bp fragment ptry-a <dig>  b revealed no basal expression and only sometimes a weak irregular expression in trichomes .

these data do not allow to decide whether the ptry-b fragment enhances both, the basal and trichome specific expression or whether it specifically regulates the basal expression. we therefore compared the expression pattern in ptry-a <dig>  b and ptry-a <dig> at different time points of gus staining procedure . we observed that the gus staining in young trichomes became detectable in both lines after two hours. while the basal expression in ptry-a <dig>  b became also detectable after two hours, no basal expression was detectable in ptry-a <dig> even after  <dig> days of gus staining. these data suggest, that the ptry-b fragment specifically up-regulates the basal try expression in the context of the ptry-a <dig> fragment.

identification of relevant promoter regions by rescue experiments
in order to test their functionality we used various promoter fragments to express the try cds in try-jc mutant plants . in order to avoid the problem that individual transformants may show a wide range of phenotypes we did not select individual lines for analysis in the t <dig> but directly analyzed the phenotype of t <dig> plants to hold account on the full phenotypic spectrum. in these experiments both, the ptry-a, b and the ptry-a <dig>  b fragments fully rescued the clustering phenotype . expression of try driven by ptry-a <dig>  however, had no significant rescue ability . the smaller fragment  only partially rescued the try-jc clustering phenotype. together these data indicate that the ptry-b fragment is essential for rescue.

regulation of the try promoter by ttg <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig> and try or cpc
in a next step we aimed to demonstrate the postulated activation/repression scheme of ttg <dig>  gl <dig>  gl <dig>  try and cpc for the minimal try promoter fragment. the current models assume that ttg <dig>  gl <dig> and gl <dig> can transcriptional activate the inhibitors try or cpc and that these in turn repress the activators and thereby also their own expression. the finding that try and cpc can compete with gl <dig> for binding to gl <dig>  <cit>  suggests that the inhibitors can counteract the activity of the activators at the protein level directly. in this case try or cpc repress their own expression without a transcriptional repression of the activators.

as try has been shown to be regulated by the activators in genetic experiments  <cit>  the try promoter provides a tool to demonstrate that try/cpc can counteract the activators without a transcriptional repression of the activators. we used cotyledons for our analysis as no gus expression was detected in this organ in ptry-a <dig>  b:gus plants . gl <dig>  gl <dig> and ttg <dig> cds under the control of the p35s promoter were used for transient transformations. in addition to these three constructs we added a p35s:gfp:yfp construct to control the bombardment efficiency. in four independent experiments analyzing each time  <dig> cells we found on average  <dig>  ±  <dig> % gus expressing cells indicating that the simultaneous constitutive expression of ttg <dig>  gl <dig> and gl <dig> induces the minimal try promoter fragment . transformation with 35s:gfp:yfp alone revealed no gus positive cells.

in a second step we tested the model whether try or cpc can counteract the activity of the activators. models derived from the finding that try and cpc compete with gl <dig> for binding to gl <dig> in yeast three hybrid experiments suggest that differential complex formation renders the proposed activator complex inactive  <cit> . we took advantage of the fact that in this experimental setup any indirect repression of try by try or cpc through the transcriptional repression of the activators is excluded as their expression is under the control of the 35s promoter. in four independent experiments with  <dig> cells in each experiment we found only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % or  <dig>  ±  <dig> % gus-positive cells when expressing p35s:try or p35s:cpc respectively in addition to the three activators. this indicates that try and cpc can counteract try activation by the three activators without a transcriptional repression of the activators.

relevance of myb and myc binding sites
our finding that the activators can activate the try promoter in transient expression assays together with the finding that gl <dig> and gl <dig> bind to the try promoter in chip experiments  <cit>  prompted us to search for putative myb and myc  binding sites. we found five putative myb and two putative myc sites in the ptry-a <dig>  b fragment that was the minimal promoter fragment for full rescue of the try phenotype . among the five putative myb sites two seemed most promising as they were identified in the context of regulatory pathways in other plants that are also regulated by ttg1-dependent pathways  <cit> . in addition the myb factor binding to these myb binding sites are in the same clade in the phylogenetic tree as gl <dig>  <cit> . we therefore focused on these two putative binding sites. to determine the role of the two selected myb and the two myc sites in the regulation of the correct expression pattern we mutated each site individually and both myb and both myc sites together . none of the mutated constructs showed a marked reduction or even absence of ptry-a <dig>  b:gus expression . however, we noted differences such that the myb <dig> site has the most positive effect on the basal expression whereas the myb <dig> and the myc sites have a repressive role. as a ptry-a <dig>  b:try construct containing mutations in both myc sites resulted in a complete rescue of the try mutant clustering phenotype these sites do not appear to be relevant in this context

the ptry-b region mediates the repression of the inhibitors repression
in a separate line of experiments we tested, whether reduced ptry:gus expression in the absence of the ptry-b fragment or in the ptry-a <dig>  b lines is caused by endogenous r3myb repressor activity. we compared the expression of the ptry-a <dig>  b, ptry-a <dig> and ptry-a <dig>  b constructs in wild type and the cpc try mutant background . all constructs revealed a strong basal and trichome specific gus expression. thus the lack of basal expression in the ptry-a <dig> line and the lack of basal and most of the trichome specific expression in the ptry-a <dig>  b line is rescued in the cpc try mutant. these data suggest that the - <dig> to - <dig> fragment  promotes the basal expression and that the ptry-b fragment and the - <dig> to - <dig>  fragments mediate repression of the inhibitors repression.

in order to show that this repression of the inhibitors repression involves the patterning activators we used transient expression assays. the p35s:gl <dig>  p35s:gl <dig> and p35s:ttg <dig> constructs were co-bombarded in wild type and cpc try mutants carrying the ptry-a <dig>  b, ptry-a <dig> and ptry-a <dig>  b constructs . in wild type we found gus-positive cells only in plants carrying the ptry-a <dig>  b construct . by contrast, all constructs revealed gus-positive cells in the cpc try mutant background indicating that this regulation event involves the trichome patterning activators. furthermore the percentage of gus-positive cells per transformed epidermal cells was much higher for ptry-a <dig>  b transformed cotyledons in cpc try double mutant indicating a stronger activation.

specific properties of the try protein in the regulation of cluster formation and trichome density
the fact that among the six r <dig> single repeat myb inhibitor genes only mutations in try lead to a clustering phenotype raised the question, whether the transcriptional regulation of try or its protein properties constitute this difference. we therefore compared reciprocal swaps of promoters and cds of the try and cpc genes for their ability to rescue the try mutant. cpc was chosen because it represents the main inhibitor for trichome density regulation and because it has a similar expression pattern including the early ubiquitous and later trichome specific expression. here we chose  <dig> bp of the 5' upstream region of the cpc gene, which showed the expected cpc expression in leaves and roots , and was able to rescue the cpc mutant trichome phenotype when fused to the cpc cds . both combinations containing the cds of try, ptry:ctry and pcpc:ctry, completely rescued the clustering phenotype . by contrast, the combination of the try promoter with the cds of cpc exhibited no significant rescue . this indicates that the specific role of try in preventing cluster formation is not based on its transcriptional regulation but on specific protein properties.

we also determined the trichome number in these rescued lines. in this respect try mutants have the opposite effect as all the other inhibitor mutants in showing fewer trichomes than wild type  <cit> . expression of try under the control of the try promoter can significantly rescue the trichome number. by contrast, the ptry:ccpc construct revealed weak but not significant rescue. when using the cpc promoter we found no rescue with the pcpc:ccpc construct and an overexpression phenotype leading to less or even no trichomes in pcpc:ctry plants. thus in summary, we recognized protein-specific properties of try in the context of try dependent trichome density regulation. the finding that the try cds driven by the cpc promoter could not rescue the try density defect suggests additional relevant differences between the two promoters in this context.

discussion
in this study we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of try to learn more about the unique role of try in trichome patterning among the r3mybs homologs as judged by the clustering phenotype of the try mutants.

role of the ptry-b fragment: general enhancer/suppressor or regulator of basal expression
our promoter analyses revealed an important role of the ptry-b fragment as it is absolutely necessary for the basal expression in the young leaf and for rescuing the clustering phenotype of the try mutant. it seems to modulate the spatial-temporal expression pattern. several findings suggest that ptry-b is specifically required for the basal expression of try. first, we never found any basal expression in the absence of the ptry-b fragment in wild type background. second, the expression in trichomes is similarly strong  with and without the ptry-b fragment and the basal expression co-appears with the trichome specific expression in the presence of the ptry-b fragment, but is not seen after  <dig> days without.

the absolute requirement of ptry-b for rescue of the try clustering phenotype immediately suggests that the basal expression of try is relevant for patterning. this finding would be an important piece of support for the current theoretical models  <cit> . as the pattern is generated in a field of initially equivalent cells, the patterning system needs to start with an initially ubiquitous expression of activators and inhibitors that is necessary for the establishment of a pattern. thus, according to this scenario the requirement of the ptry-b fragment and therefore also of the basal expression supports this type of model.

how is the basal try expression regulated by the ptry-b fragment? an answer towards this end comes from our analysis of the ptry-a <dig>  b:gus and ptry-a3:gus constructs in try cpc mutants. the findings that the ptry-a <dig> fragment can be activated by gl <dig> gl <dig> and ttg <dig> in the try cpc double mutants but not in wild type together with the presence of basal expression in ptry-a <dig> try cpc plants indicates that the ptry-b fragment mediates the repression of the try repression by try or cpc. thus the apparent requirement of the ptry-b fragment for basal expression is in fact a double negative regulatory event. the current data suggest that the - <dig> to - <dig> fragment is important for turning on the basal expression and that try/cpc inhibit this activation with the immediate upstream - <dig> to - <dig> and downstream - <dig> to - <dig> regions counteracting this inhibition. as the absence of the myb <dig> site leads to an increased basal expression it is possible that this site is involved in this regulation loop. similarly, the higher basal expression upon the deletion of the two myc sites can be interpreted as a function of these sites in the double negative repression loop.

self-repression of try without transcriptional regulating of the activators
models explaining trichome formation in arabidopsis are derived from the activator-inhibitor model formulated by meinhardt und gierer  <cit> . this theoretical model explains pattern formation with two components: an activator activates its own inhibitors and its own expression with the inhibitor being able to move faster than the activator.

when adapting this theoretical model to the biological context there are two possibilities. first, the inhibitor down-regulates its own expression indirectly through the down regulation of the activator. second, the inhibitor represses its own expression through competitive complex formation  <cit> . while we can not exclude the first possibility, our data show that the second scenario is sufficient. we show that the minimal try promoter can be ectopically activated by the combined expression of gl <dig>  gl <dig> and ttg <dig> in cotyledon cells. as the three activators are expressed under the control of the 35s promoter any transcriptional feed back loops involving these three genes are unlikely to be relevant in this experiment. the repression of the activity of the three activators by try or cpc provides evidence that try and cpc represses the try expression directly rather than through a transcriptional feed back loop involving the activator genes.

specific properties of try protein for patterning
to further understand the molecular nature of the uniqueness of try among the six r3-single repeat myb inhibitors, we used promoter swap experiments with cpc which shares all aspects of the try expression pattern as judged by promoter:gus analysis. this enabled us to study the relevance of the transcriptional regulation and protein function of both genes in the try mutant cluster formation and density phenotypes. we found a different behavior of try and cpc proteins in these rescuing experiments such that only try protein could rescue the try mutant clustering and density phenotype when expressed under the try promoter. a similar situation was found in cpc mutant rescue experiments where the try protein expression under the control of the cpc promoter resulted in a stronger overexpression phenotype as compared to the cpc protein  <cit> . a contribution of try specific promoter properties was only found in the context of trichome density regulation. this is contrast to the behavior of etc <dig> another homolog of try and cpc. the etc <dig> mutant could be rescued by etc <dig> in the same manner by regulation through the etc <dig>  cpc and try promoter, so that the promoters were interchangeable with respect to the trichome density phenotype in the etc <dig> mutant but not with respect to the try mutant  <cit> . thus try dependent regulation of trichome density is dependent on both, specific protein properties as well as specific aspects of transcriptional regulation.

the observed differences between try and cpc protein functions could in principle be due to various aspects including the protein stability, protein movement and their interaction with other proteins, in particular the bhlh factors. both proteins have been shown to interact with bhlh factors  <cit> . their interactions, however, seem to differ as cpc binds stronger to gl <dig>  <cit>  and suppresses the binding of gl <dig> to gl <dig> more efficiently than try  <cit> . different strength in their binding to gl <dig> is also likely to change the intercellular movement of try and cpc  <cit> . both proteins have been shown to move between cells and share a  <dig> bp n-terminal region in which w <dig> and m <dig> were shown to be necessary for movement of cpc and are conserved in the try protein  <cit> . however, try protein is lacking the first 9aa that were also be shown to be necessary for cpc movement  <cit>  and could therefore in principle be responsible for a different movement behavior. the most obvious difference between the try protein and cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig> and tcl <dig> is its c-terminal extension of unknown function  <cit> . while we begin to understand the functional diversification of the r <dig> single myb factors in trichome development it is still elusive which properties are responsible for the differences in their requirement for clustering and density control.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we show that the auto-repressive effect of try does not require a transcriptional downregulation of the activators suggesting that differential complex formation is biologically relevant. we further show that the unique role of try among the inhibitors is a property of the try protein. finally our analysis of the try promoter lead to the identification of a  <dig> bp fragment sufficient to rescue the try mutant phenotype. it contains a fragment that mediates the repression of its own repression suggesting a complex regulation scheme. it is likely, that we are seeing here just the tip of an iceberg, as the transcriptional regulation of try has additional complexity at the level of organ specificity involving additional regulatory genes such as the well studied squamosa promoter binding protein like  gene  <cit> .
