BACKGROUND
crossing plants of the same species but different ploidies often alters seed development, generating reciprocal phenotypes depending on the direction of the cross  <cit> . particularly dramatic effects are seen in endosperm, a fertilization product derived from the diploid central cell and a haploid sperm that transfers nutrients from the seed parent to the developing or germinating embryo. in general, an increased ratio of paternally to maternally contributed genomes in the seed --generated for example by crossing a diploid seed parent with a tetraploid pollen parent--is associated with increased growth of endosperm, while an increased ratio of maternal to paternal genomes  inhibits endosperm growth. a widely accepted interpretation of interploidy cross phenotypes is that they disrupt the balance in the seed of active copies of parentally imprinted genes, which, depending on the particular gene, are expressed from only the maternal or only the paternal alleles  <cit> . study of imprinting in plants has focused on two model species, arabidopsis thaliana and zea mays; in both, parent-specific expression of imprinted genes is largely or exclusively confined to endosperm, with expression generally either biallelic or absent in the embryo  <cit> . to date, maternally expressed in embryo  is the only known gene that is monoallelically expressed in the embryo  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, crosses between diploid and tetraploid plants often produce viable triploid embryos, with 2xx4x crosses  generating heavy seeds containing large embryos, and 4xx2x crosses producing light seeds with small embryos  <cit> . paternal excess is associated with increased and prolonged proliferation of the endosperm, overgrowth of the chalazal endosperm and associated nodules, an abnormally large seed cavity, and delay in endosperm cellularization , while maternal excess is characterized by inhibited endosperm division, small chalazal endosperm, absence of nodules, small seed cavity, and precocious cellularization and mitotic arrest of endosperm. therefore the extent of endosperm growth is an important component in the final size of the seed and embryo even in a species with only one cell layer of endosperm remaining in the mature seed. reciprocal crosses between diploid and hexaploid arabidopsis plants produce more extreme versions of these phenotypes, and this level of parental genomic imbalance is also lethal: embryos arrest by heart stage, and the seeds abort. in maize, crosses between diploid and tetraploid plants usually result in seed abortion  <cit> , but before this occurs, the developing seeds also display reciprocal phenotypes, with delayed endoreduplication  observed in kernels with paternal excess, and early mitotic arrest when there is maternal excess  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, a maternal mutation in any one of four 'fis-class' genes--fertilization independent seed  <dig> /medea , fis <dig>  fis3/fertilization independent endosperm , or multicopy suppressor of ira  <dig> --leads to seed abortion, with phenotypes including overexpansion of the seed cavity, failure of endosperm cellularization, large chalazal endosperm and nodules, and arrest of embryos around heart stage  <cit> . intriguingly, these phenotypes are very similar to those resulting from interploidy crosses that generate a lethal level of paternal excess  <cit> . msi <dig> mutants deviate somewhat from this model in producing fewer peripheral endosperm nuclei than wild-type seeds, although chalazal endosperm and nodules are still enlarged  <cit> . fis1/mea was the first imprinted gene to be described in arabidopsis. in endosperm, fis1/mea is expressed only from the maternally derived alleles, while it is biallelic in embryo, at least from torpedo stage onward  <cit> . fis <dig> is expressed only from maternal alleles in developing seeds  <cit> . there is no molecular evidence for imprinting of the other fis-class genes. the four fis-class gene products participate in polycomb repressive complex   <dig>  <cit> , which, like animal prcs inhibits transcription of target genes through epigenetic modification of chromatin  <cit> . the similarity of fis-class mutant and lethal paternal excess phenotypes led to the proposal that one function of the wild-type fis proteins is to repress transcription of loci in the maternally derived genome that are normally expressed only when paternally contributed  <cit> . this has been supported by the discovery that the fis1/mea-containing prc <dig> represses the maternal alleles of pheres <dig> , an imprinted gene which is preferentially expressed from the paternal genome  <cit> .

another feature of fis-class mutants is an 'autonomous endosperm' phenotype. wild-type arabidopsis embryo sacs must be fertilized before the egg or central cell will divide. in contrast, if fis-class mutant flowers are prevented from self-pollinating, the central cell nevertheless divides and forms a syncytial structure resembling peripheral endosperm, even though there is no cellularization or regional specification  <cit> . in msi <dig> mutants, the unfertilized egg also divides to form a small multicellular structure expressing several markers for embryogenesis  <cit> . the seed-like structures produced by unfertilized fis-class mutant ovules invariably abort. comparison of gene expression in fertilized and unfertilized fis-class mutants could reveal genes that are normally repressed by prc <dig> in seeds.

in the work presented below, we investigated gene expression underlying paternal and maternal excess phenotypes using two different microarray platforms, and also profiled fertilized and unfertilized fis-class mutants. this project had several goals, including the identification of genes that are not necessarily imprinted, but which are nevertheless associated with promoting or inhibiting seed growth; and comparing gene expression between seeds from interploidy crosses and fis-class mutants. another goal was to gather molecular data to help us position fertilized and unfertilized fis-class mutants on the maternal-paternal spectrum. we found that fertilized fis <dig> mutant seeds have similar transcriptional profiles to seeds with paternal excess, showing that the shared phenotypes are underpinned by similar patterns of gene expression. to learn more about regulation of seed size, we filtered our data for sets of genes strongly associated with enhanced or inhibited seed growth. our results illustrate the molecular link between paternal excess and fis-class mutations, and potentially provide tools for altering seed size.

RESULTS
generation of samples and hybridization to arrays
to explore the patterns of gene expression underlying the phenotypes of seeds generated by interploidy crosses and fis-class mutants, we performed two independent microarray experiments using biological replicate samples and different array platforms to increase confidence in the results. other cross-platform comparisons have been successful in arabidopsis  <cit> .

for our first experiment, rna was extracted from siliques at  <dig> dap resulting from the crosses 6xx2x and 4xx2x , 2xx2x , 2xx4x and 2xx6x , and fis1/meax2x, and hybridized to custom agilent 22k two-dye  arrays . for the second experiment, rna was extracted at  <dig> dap from two further independent biological samples of the crosses listed above, and also from unfertilized siliques of male-sterile msi <dig> mutants at  <dig> days after floral opening , and hybridized to affymetrix ath <dig> full-genome chips http://www.affymetrix.com. thus, our experiments incorporated seeds from interploidy crosses generating both viable and lethal parental imbalance, a fertilized fis-class mutant that develops with a phenotype resembling lethal paternal excess, and an unfertilized fis-class mutant that develops with no paternal contribution.

the phenotypes of all crosses are illustrated in figure  <dig>  at  <dig> dap, seeds with the normal balance of maternal to paternal genomes  typically contain a heart-stage embryo, peripheral endosperm which has begun to cellularize from the micropylar pole, a compact chalazal endosperm, and endosperm nodules . in seeds with paternal excess  there is no cellular endosperm at this stage, and the chalazal endosperm is enlarged . fis1x2x seeds  likewise contain only free-nuclear endosperm, and in common with 2xx6x crosses, the endosperm never cellularizes and the seeds abort  <cit> . fertilized fis <dig> mutants also produce greatly enlarged endosperm nodules. therefore the characteristic phenotypes both of paternal excess and of a fertilized fis-class mutant include overproliferation of endosperm and delay or failure of cellularization. at the other end of the phenotypic spectrum, seeds with maternal excess  produce small endosperms that cellularize precociously, and tiny chalazal endosperms with no associated nodules . the endosperm fails to cellularize in unfertilized msi <dig> mutants  but these also lack chalazal endosperm, so are difficult to classify according to endosperm growth and morphology.

rna hybridization and statistical analysis for each microarray platform are described in the methods. results for the affymetrix and agilent experiments are available through geo http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo under the accession number gse <dig>  correspondence between affymetrix and agilent probes was determined as described in the methods. this yielded a list of  <dig>  genes that we used in the subsequent analysis . we subtracted from this list all genes that were below a threshold of absolute expression in all samples, or which had widely differing ratios in the dye-swap experiments indicating unreliable expression , giving a final list of  <dig>  unique atids that were called present in at least one sample. these atids, along with the corresponding agilent and affymetrix probesets and averaged slr and pslr values , are provided in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> online. interestingly  <dig>  of the  <dig>  genes predicted to be early seed specific by day et al  <cit> , were found to be present in our dataset . of the genes called present in the peripheral endosperm of the goldberg and harada dataset http://seedgenenetwork.net/arabidopsis a similar proportion  were also represented in our dataset . this gives us the confidence that using whole siliques as the experimental material captures a significant proportion of the endosperm expressed genes.

differential transcript accumulation reflects altered developmental programmes, not increased gene dosage
to identify genes that were over- or underexpressed  in each interploidy cross or fis-class mutant relative to 2xx2x, we generated lists of genes with signal-log ratios  ≥  <dig>  or ≤ - <dig> , corresponding to changes in expression of approximately 50% up or down; many genes had much higher changes than this. for affymetrix data we based the lists on p-value weighted slrs  to minimize interference from values for which there was little statistical evidence for differential expression . genes called up or down together with their slrs/pslrs are presented in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> online. we next compared over- and underexpressed genes across platforms for each cross; for example we ultimately only called a gene up if its slr was ≥  <dig>  in both affymetrix and agilent datasets. the lists of genes called up and down that were supported by both platforms are provided in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> online.

the numbers of genes called up or down for each cross and each platform are shown, along with the numbers of genes in common across both platforms for each cross , and the percentage of the maximum possible agreement between platforms. the right-hand column shows the percentage of each list consisting of transcription factors . for all samples except for msi <dig> the percentage of transcription factors was calculated from the lists of genes called up or down in both platforms . see additional file  <dig> table s <dig> for genes called up or down in each platform and additional file  <dig> table s <dig> for genes called up or down in both platforms.

the extent of agreement between the affymetrix and agilent datasets was calculated as the percentage of genes in common out of the possible maximum . the overlap between datasets ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> %; this compares favourably with the results of pylatuik and fobert  <cit> , who recorded cross-platform overlaps of  <dig>  to  <dig> % between sets of arabidopsis genes overexpressed  <dig> -fold.

we next investigated whether the sets of genes called up in the two crosses generating paternal excess had more in common with each other than with genes up in maternal excess, and vice versa. the results of these comparisons are represented in figure  <dig>  we found that datasets from phenotypically similar crosses had a higher proportion of genes in common than datasets from opposite crosses. for example, the correspondence between genes called up in 2xx4x and 2xx6x was 46% of the possible maximum , although one of these crosses produces viable seeds and the other is lethal; while the overlap between genes up in 2xx4x and 4xx2x seeds, which are both viable, was only 10% of the maximum. these results also indicate that overexpression observed in these experiments is much more likely to reflect genuine changes in developmental programmes than simply the presence of extra copies of genes in seeds with increased ploidy. we next compared genes called up in fis1x2x with those up in the two lethal interploidy crosses. more than 50% of genes overexpressed in 2xx6x were also up in fis1x2x, while only 7% of genes up in 6xx2x were up in fis1x2x, supporting the hypothesis that fis-class mutations have a paternalizing effect on seed development.

we assayed gene expression at a relatively early stage since we are especially interested in identifying genes that control seed development. nevertheless, we expected that some genes would be over- or underexpressed as a consequence of altered development rather than as a cause. to assess whether genes showing differential expression at  <dig> dap could be regulators of seed development, we compared the list of  <dig> transcription factors annotated in the arabidopsis genome  with the sets of genes we called up or down. there are  <dig>  protein coding genes annotated in tair release  <dig>  http://www.arabidopsis.org. so, approximately  <dig> % of the genome consists of transcription factors. a similar proportion, 8% , of the genes called present in our experiment are on the transcription factor list. however most of our up or down lists contained a higher proportion than this . we conclude that genes controlling seed development, rather than merely responding to upstream changes, are well represented in our transcription profiles.

validation of microarray data
to validate the microarray data we examined the expression of  <dig> genes using quantitative real-time pcr . these genes were mainly chosen because of their expression trends in the microarray data, and some will be discussed in more detail below. results are presented in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> online and summarized in table  <dig>  which shows the extent of agreement between each microarray platform and qrt-pcr for the  <dig> genes. out of  <dig> calls tested , microarray and qrt-pcr data gave the same call for  <dig> , giving overall agreement of 77%. a similar level of agreement between microarray and qrt-pcr data for transcription in maize anthers was recently reported by skibbe et al.  <cit> . where our microarray and qrt-pcr calls did not agree, the majority nevertheless had fold changes in the same direction . only one sample, 4xx2x agilent, had less than 65% agreement with the qrt-pcr findings. none of the genes from this dataset where qrt-pcr and the agilent data disagreed were called changed in both agilent and affymetrix platforms, and therefore were not included in our final list of genes called down in this cross. we conclude from our validation that the microarray data is particularly robust for genes that show the same expression trend in both platforms.

expression of  <dig> genes was tested using qrt-pcr and calls of up, down, or not changed were compared with calls for the same genes in the microarray data. each cell shows the number  of calls that agreed out of a maximum of  <dig>  qrt-pcr results are provided in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

hierarchical clustering of expression data identifies maternal and paternal groups
we were interested in testing whether the crosses generating paternal or maternal excess had similar expression patterns, and we also wanted to position the fertilized and unfertilized fis-class mutants on the maternal-paternal spectrum. we used hierarchical clustering  <cit>  to compare expression trends among all samples. repeated clustering using different distance measures  robustly showed distinct 'paternalized' and 'maternalized' transcriptome sets, where 2xx4x, 2xx6x, and fis1x2x formed the paternalized cluster and 4xx2x, 6xx2x, and parthenogenetic msi <dig> belonged to the maternalized cluster . principal components analysis of the microarrays also gave results which are consistent with the hierarchical clustering .

the transcriptional profile of fis1x2x crosses is most similar to the profiles of 2xx6x seeds from both platforms. this supports a model in which fis-class mutations 'paternalize' the maternally inherited genomes in the endosperm by removing crucial maternal-specific function, so that the balance of maternal:paternal genomes is in effect more like the ratio generated by 2xx6x crosses  <cit> . although msi <dig> is also a fis-class mutant, it was not pollinated for our experiment, and therefore not surprisingly had a very different transcriptional profile from fertilized fis <dig> seeds. msi <dig> clustered most closely with 6xx2x; this may reflect shared features such as near or total absence of chalazal endosperm.

association of gene ontologies with different seed phenotypes
to determine whether categories of genes with particular biological function were associated with different seed phenotypes, we looked for go  biological process terms  <cit>  that were over- or underrepresented among genes showing differential expression, using the gostat tool available at http://gostat.wehi.edu.au <cit> . we compared the list of  <dig>  genes called present in the experiment  with genes that were called up or down in the interploidy crosses and in fis1x2x.

selected biological process terms that occurred with significantly enhanced or reduced frequency  are shown in table  <dig>  some terms were omitted because of redundancy. not all up and down lists contained categories with altered frequency. loci called down in 2xx6x and fis1x2x were enriched for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. downregulated genes in triploid seeds have previously been found to be enriched in genes within the functional category of cell cycle regulation  <cit> . this was at first surprising given the overproliferation of 2xx6x and fis1x2x endosperms, but these seeds also display aberrations in the cell cycle such as failure of endosperm cellularization. strikingly,  <dig> of the genes called down in 2xx6x and  <dig> of the genes called down in fis1x2x are among a set of  <dig> arabidopsis genes recently identified as showing an expression peak at the g2/m boundary in synchronized cell culture  <cit> . mitosis-specific genes called down in 2xx6x and/or fis1x2x include the syntaxin syp111/knolle ; several kinesins such as hinkel/atnack <dig>  and zcf <dig> ; the mitotic cyclins cycb1; <dig> , cycb1; <dig> , and cycb1; <dig> ; cdkb2; <dig> , a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in the g2/m transition; and the myb family transcription factor myb3r- <dig> . syp111/knolle is expressed in mitotically dividing cells and in cellularizing endosperm, and is required for membrane vesicle fusion in the plane of cell division  <cit> . kinesins associate with microtubules and are involved in cytoskeleton organization and transport of vesicles and organelles; hik/atnack <dig> is essential for cell plate formation during mitotic cytokinesis  <cit>  and zcf <dig> is involved in interactions between the spindle and the kinetochores of chromosomes  <cit> . myb3r- <dig> is proposed to regulate genes involved in the g2/m transition  <cit> . nearly 80% of the mitosis-specific genes downregulated in 2xx6x are also called down in 6xx2x, perhaps because cell division has ceased in seeds with lethal maternal excess by this stage. underexpression of genes involved in dna replication initiation in 6xx2x, is consistent with reduced division in 6xx2x.

association of individual gene expression with seed phenotypes
to learn more about factors involved in controlling seed size, we were interested in identifying the genes most strongly associated with enhanced or inhibited seed growth. to determine the genes with the most robust associations we used several filtering criteria.  as described above, we only called a gene up or down in interploidy crosses if this was supported in both platforms.  we next looked for intersections of gene sets that were up or down in crosses generating phenotypically similar seeds. for example, to find the genes strongly associated with enhanced endosperm/seed growth we chose genes overexpressed in both 2xx4x and 2xx6x crosses.  after identifying genes called up in seeds in one phenotypic class, we applied a further condition that those genes should not be up in the opposite class. this was to avoid false positives from genes that may have been overexpressed because of polyploidy, stress, or other causes affecting seeds irrespective of the extent of their growth. to increase the selectivity of the final lists we used broad definitions for 'not up' and 'not down': we called a gene 'not up' if the agilent slr and affymetrix pslr were both equal to or below  <dig>  , and 'not down' if the slrs/pslrs were = - <dig> . for example, our list of genes strongly associated with endosperm overproliferation were called 'up' in 2xx4x and 2xx6x, and also 'not up' in 4xx2x and 6xx2x.

the lists of seed class-associated genes, along with annotations and go biological process terms , are presented in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> online. the first group  comprises lists of 'large seed genes' . these genes are positively associated with large seeds , or negatively associated with small seeds . we considered genes up in 2xx4x and 2xx6x and not up in 4xx2x and 6xx2x to be particularly strongly associated with promoting or responding to seed growth; these are shown in table  <dig>  the second group  contains lists of 'small seed genes', which are positively associated with small seeds  or negatively associated with large seeds . genes up in 4xx2x and 6xx2x and not up in 2xx4x and 2xx6x are shown in table  <dig>  we also constructed a list of genes called up in the two fis-class mutants  , to identify genes overexpressed in both fertilized and unfertilized seeds with impaired function of the prc <dig> that contains fis1/mea and msi <dig>

genes associated with large/overproliferating seeds
there were  <dig> genes called up in 2xx4x but not up in crosses generating maternal excess . more than half  were also up in 2xx6x , and all but ten of these were likewise overexpressed in fis1x2x. this underlines the similarities in transcription profiles not only between interploidy crosses generating different degrees of paternal excess, but between these and fis <dig> mutant seeds. ninety-five genes were up in 2xx6x and fis1x2x but not 4xx2x and 6xx2x , of which  <dig> were not also up in 2xx4x, and therefore associated with an extreme paternal excess phenotype. finally there were  <dig> genes called down in 4xx2x but not down in 2xx4x and 2xx6x , including  <dig> also down in 6xx2x, and  <dig> down in 4xx2x, 6xx2x, and msi <dig>  twelve genes were up in 2xx4x, 2xx6x, and fis1x2x and also down in 4xx2x and 6xx2x , indicating especially strong positive association with seed growth.

transcription factors
mads-box genes are involved in many aspects of plant development, including essential roles in reproduction such as specification of floral organ identity, and regulatory roles during seed and fruit development  <cit> . strikingly, a set of co-regulated and interacting mads-box transcription factors  <cit>  are associated with large seeds. the arabidopsis interactome  <cit>  visualized through the interaction viewer http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/interactions/ shows the interactions between these mads box proteins . similar shared functions of the agamous-like gene clusters have been demonstrated in early endosperm development and have been implicated in interspecific incompatibility  <cit> . these notably include phe <dig>  and its close homologue phe <dig> , which are both overexpressed in 2xx4x, 2xx6x, and fis1x2x. phe <dig> was previously identified as overexpressed in fis1/mea mutants in a microarray experiment performed on younger seeds than we used here  <cit> . phe <dig> and phe <dig> share the same affymetrix probeset and therefore either transcript may have been responsible for the signal. the agilent array contains separate probes for these two genes but due to sequence similarity, cross-hybridization was still a possibility. however qrt-pcr using gene-specific primers gave similar expression profiles for both genes , indicating that both phe <dig> and phe <dig> are likely to be upregulated in seeds with paternal excess or a paternalizing fis1x2x mutation. this scenario is supported by the observation that phe <dig> expression is repressed by fis1/mea, an inhibitor of proliferation  <cit> . in our microarray data, the mads-box genes agl <dig>  and agl <dig>  were called up in one or more of 2xx4x, 2xx6x, or fis1x2x, while our qrt-pcr data showed both genes were overexpressed in all three large seed genotypes . these mads-box genes are co-expressed with phe <dig>  and their products interact with the phe <dig> and phe <dig> proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays  <cit> . we also tested agl <dig>  as it was likewise reported to interact with the phe proteins, and called up in 2xx6x and fis1x2x; qrt-pcr showed this gene is upregulated in 2xx4x, 2xx6x, and fis1x2x but not up in 4xx2x or 6xx2x. several seed defects leading to abortion were observed in agl <dig> seeds. these seeds have a low number of endosperm nuclei and exhibit precocious endosperm cellularization as well as embryo defects . a further mads-box gene called up in all three large seed samples, agl <dig> , encodes a protein reported to interact with agl <dig> 

it is interesting to observe that the mads box proteins interact in different complexes in different backgrounds to regulate endosperm development; agl 62- agl <dig> for endosperm development , agl80-agl <dig> for central cell development  <cit>  and agl62-agl <dig> endosperm rescue overcoming post zygotic barrier in a thaliana × a arenosa crosses  <cit> . hence the overexpressed agls in our dataset may very well interact as higher order complexes to regulate endosperm development in the interploidy crosses and/or be part of a transcriptional cascade promoting seed growth.

overexpression of individual genes e.g., agl <dig>  phe <dig>  agl <dig> under the endosperm specific promoter of at5g <dig>  <cit>  did not result in any significant change in seed size, overexpression of phe <dig> under the same promoter however yielded slightly heavier seeds . this might indicate that two or more members need to be overexpressed for a visible phenotype. further experiments such as study of mutants of one or more members of the complex are required to investigate whether upregulation of these mads-box genes is a cause or a consequence of enhanced seed growth.

phe <dig> is preferentially expressed in endosperm from the paternal allele only, and therefore its expression trend in our data was as expected. we were surprised however to find an oppositely imprinted gene, fwa , also called up in 2xx4x, 2xx6x, and fis1x2x. fwa is a homeodomain transcription factor that is expressed only in endosperm, and only from the maternal alleles  <cit> . therefore we expected fwa to show a complementary expression trend to phe <dig>  i.e. up in 4xx2x and 6xx2x, but not up in paternal excess crosses. our qrt-pcr data for fwa supports our microarray data for large seeds and additionally calls fwa down in 4xx2x, 6xx2x, and msi <dig> , indicating the microarry data revealed a bona fide expression trend. one possibility to be tested is whether fwa expression might be deregulated in a background of parental imbalance, so that it becomes expressed from paternal alleles, or in the embryo, or both. it was recently reported that phe <dig> loses imprinting in interspecific crosses between a. thaliana and a. arenosa that also generate paternal excess, becoming ectopically expressed from maternal alleles  <cit> . another imprinted gene mpc which is paternally imprinted  <cit> , also shows an upregulation in the 2xx6x, and fis1x2x crosses but is unchanged compared to the balanced cross  in the 4xx2x and 6xx2x. it will be interesting to determine whether both fwa and mpc are deregulated in the case of paternal imbalance.

the transcription factor wrky10/miniseed <dig>  , up in 2xx6x and fis1x2x, also has a known role in seed growth. qrt-pcr confirmed our microarray data and in addition returned an up call for 2xx4x and a down call for 6xx2x . this expression trend supports a previously reported role for mini <dig> in promoting endosperm growth, based on the observation that loss-of-function mini <dig> mutants produce small seeds with small endosperms that cellularize early  <cit> .

genes involved in cell proliferation and chromatin organization
although paternalized seeds display increased and prolonged endosperm proliferation, and delayed or inhibited cytokinesis, few core cell cycle genes were overexpressed in large seeds. the exceptions included two d cyclins, cycd4; <dig>  and cycd4; <dig> . the former was called up in 2xx6x and fis1x2x, and the latter was up in all three large seed crosses but not in maternal excess. qrt-pcr confirmed the microarray data for large seeds for both genes, and additionally strengthened the association of cycd4; <dig> with seed growth by showing it is downregulated in 4xx2x and 6xx2x . d cyclins are involved in the g <dig> to s transition and respond to signals such as cytokinin and sucrose  <cit> . cycd4; <dig> was found to be rate-limiting for cell division in germinating seeds  <cit> . cycd4; <dig> has previously been reported to lack the rb-binding motif and pest sequence of other d cyclins, but functional assays show it likewise has a role in proliferation  <cit> . to our knowledge cycd4; <dig> is absent or shows extremely low expression in other microarray experiments http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch and therefore its strong association with seed growth here makes it an interesting candidate for control of cell proliferation in developing seeds. del2/e2fd/e2l <dig> , encoding an atpyical e2f, was called up in 2xx4x and 2xx6x, and down in maternal excess and msi1; qrt-pcr indicated a similar trend although comparatively lower upregulation in  <dig> ×  <dig> . typical e2f proteins heterodimerize with dp proteins to bind e2f sites in promoters of genes associated with dna synthesis and replication and cell cycle control, including d cyclins, and may be positive or negative regulators of cell division. in contrast, atypical e2fs bind e2f sites as monomers and repress e2f-regulated promoters  <cit> . the function of del2/e2fd has not yet been described.

consistent with increased cell proliferation in seeds with paternal excess and inhibited proliferation in maternalized seeds, many genes involved in dna replication, chromatin organization, rna translation, or protein synthesis were overexpressed in large seeds and/or down in small seeds. these included histones , genes involved in chromatin modification , and members of the origin of replication complex . suvh <dig> and sdg21/suvh <dig> are related to animal su3- <dig> proteins, which affect chromatin packaging through histone methylation  <cit> , while fas <dig> is required for heterochromatin formation  <cit> . seeds mutant for atorc <dig> undergo very few endosperm or embryo divisions before arresting, indicating that this gene is essential for cell proliferation in the seed  <cit> ; downregulation of atorc <dig> in 4xx2x is consistent with this role. in contrast atorc1a may be involved in endoreduplication rather than proliferation  <cit> . although endoreduplication is not a prominent feature of arabidopsis endosperm as in maize, there is some evidence for endoreduplication in chalazal endosperm  <cit> . atorc1a was called down in both 4xx2x and 6xx2x seeds, and this could be a factor in the suppression of peripheral endosperm cell division or of chalazal endosperm growth observed in seeds with maternal excess.

we observed differential expression of many genes involved in metabolism or signalling of the hormones cytokinin, gibberellin, brassinosteroid, and auxin. according to our microarray data the cytokinin oxidase ckx <dig>  is up in 2xx6x and fis1x2x; this was confirmed by qrt-pcr , which also indicated overexpression in 2xx4x and msi <dig> and underexpression in 4xx2x crosses. this pattern was at first surprising as cytokinin oxidases catalyse the irreversible degradation of cytokinin, which is associated with cell proliferation. however, recent work shows that ckx overexpression increases seed size in arabidopsis to a greater extent than can be completely accounted for by the accompanying loss of fertility  <cit> . gibberellic acid  is known to be required for seed germination but there is also evidence that it is essential for seed growth  <cit> . several genes involved in ga metabolism or response were upregulated in large seeds: these included ga <dig> , encoding a copalyl diphosphate synthase that catalyses the first committed step in ga biosynthesis, at1g <dig>  encoding a member of the ga 20-oxidase family that catalyses synthesis of bioactive ga, and at2g <dig>  a ga-regulated family protein. this last gene had a particularly strong association with seed growth, showing very high levels of overexpression both in microarray data and in qrt-pcr--according to the latter, 18-fold in 2xx4x, 69-fold in 2xx6x, and 30-fold in fis1x2x--and severe underexpression in 4xx2x, 6xx2x, and msi <dig>  other microarray experiments show this gene is highly expressed in siliques and also present in isolated seeds http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch, but no function has been reported. brassinosteroids  promote cell growth and division, and are most abundant in pollen and immature seeds  <cit> . genes involved in br synthesis or response that were up in large seeds or down in small seeds included bsu <dig> , encoding a serine threonine phosphatase preferentially expressed in elongating cells which is involved in response to brs  <cit> ; and dwf <dig> , whose product catalyses a rate-limiting step in br synthesis  <cit> . further genes involved in hormone metabolism and function are annotated on the lists in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  s <dig> - <dig> 

genes associated with small/underproliferating seeds
seeds with maternal excess are characterized by a small seed cavity, inhibited proliferation and early cellularization of endosperm, small chalazal endosperm, and absence of endosperm nodules. one hundred-nineteen genes were overexpressed in 4xx2x but not in 2xx4x and 2xx6x, and of these  <dig> were also up in 6xx2x, and  <dig> in msi <dig> as well . unfertilized msi <dig> seeds have no chalazal endosperm or nodules, and fewer endosperm nuclei than a fertilized fis-class mutant would produce, but in contrast to seeds with maternal excess, the seed cavity is not notably small in parthenogenetic msi <dig>  endosperm fails to cellularize, and embryo development is very limited. therefore it is not surprising that there was less overlap between the transcriptional profiles of msi <dig> and seeds with maternal excess than there was between fertilized fis <dig> and seeds with paternal excess. twelve genes were called down in 2xx4x but not 4xx2x and 6xx2x , and  <dig> genes were called down in 2xx6x and fis1x2x .

few of the genes positively associated with small seeds had an obvious link to their phenotype, suggesting that seed growth is more likely to be restricted by downregulation than overexpression of key genes. several genes involved in auxin function were associated with small seeds, including the auxin response factor arf5/mp , up in 4xx2x, 6xx2x, and msi <dig>  which is involved in embryonic patterning and cell expansion  <cit> , and cyp711a1/max <dig> , also up in maternal excess and msi <dig>  max genes regulate auxin transport capacity by regulating abundance of pin auxin efflux carrier proteins  <cit> ; it is interesting in this context that pin <dig>  which is upregulated in max <dig> mutants  <cit> , is also downregulated in 4xx2x crosses. it was surprising to find cycd3; <dig>  downregulated in 2xx6x and fis1x2x, as this has a similar expression pattern during seed germination to cycd4; <dig>  <cit> , which is up in these crosses ; this could reflect different roles for these d cyclins during earlier seed development.

genes upregulated in fis-class mutants
genes overexpressed in both fis1x2x and msi <dig>  could include some that are deregulated by fis-class mutations and involved in the overproliferation of fis mutant endosperms. this is supported by the appearance of phe <dig> in this list, which is controlled by the fis1- and msi1-containing prc2; overexpression of this gene in unfertilized msi <dig> seeds is particularly striking as they contain no paternally contributed alleles, which normally contribute the great majority of phe <dig> expression. similarly, ectopic expression of phe <dig> was reported in unfertilized fis3/fie seeds  <cit> . further candidate growth-promoting genes overexpressed in fis1x2x and msi <dig> are the transcription factors phe <dig>  agl <dig>  and agl <dig>  all discussed above. other upregulated genes that could be involved in the ectopic seed growth observed in fis mutants include the mads box genes agl <dig>  and agl <dig> ; atga3ox <dig> , encoding a gibberellin 3-oxidase preferentially expressed in flowers and siliques that catalyses synthesis of bioactive ga  <cit> ; and cpd , involved in brassinosteroid synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
reciprocal interploidy crosses in plants often give complementary seed phenotypes, but little is known about the alterations to transcriptional programmes responsible for this. here we investigated gene expression underlying the differential development of seeds with paternal or maternal excess. one explanation for interploidy cross phenotypes is that they disrupt the balance of active copies of imprinted genes in the seed. mutations in fis-class genes also disrupt imprinting, and fertilized seeds of fis-class mutants resemble interploidy seeds with lethal paternal excess, while unfertilized fis-class mutant seeds develop autonomously with no paternal contribution, and have phenotypic attributes of both paternal and maternal excess. therefore we also profiled fertilized and unfertilized fis-class mutants to test their transcriptional profiles against seeds with parental genomic imbalance, and to identify genes deregulated by impairment of prc <dig> function. hierarchical clustering and comparison of genes called differentially expressed placed fis1x2x seeds in the same group as seeds with paternal excess, showing that the similar phenotypes are indeed underpinned by similar patterns of gene expression. figure 5a is a schematic diagram of a composite seed summarizing the main features of maternal and paternal excess, and placing the interploidy and fis1x2x crosses on the maternal:paternal spectrum based on their transcriptional profiles as described above. msi <dig> autonomous seeds cluster with maternal excess but also show many differences, which may be due to the paternalizing effect of the fis-class mutation as well as lack of fertilization, and therefore its position on the spectrum is less certain. to learn more about regulation of seed size, we filtered our data for sets of genes strongly associated with enhanced or inhibited seed growth. genes overexpressed in large seeds but not in small seeds included many candidates for factors controlling seed growth, such as a group of mads-box transcription factors encoding interacting proteins , cell cycle genes, and genes involved in hormone pathways. some of these genes are also overexpressed in unfertilized fis-class mutants, suggesting particularly strong association with endosperm proliferation. it would be interesting to study whether any methylation differences that exist between genes in the different interploidy crosses contribute towards the imbalance of imprinted gene expression. methylation asymmetry has been correlated with the monoallelic expression pattern of imprinted genes in the endosperm and with differences in the expression of genes in the embryo and endosperm in both wildtype as well as dme mutant seeds  <cit> . it would also be of interest to look closely at the maternally derived poliv dependent si-rnas  <cit>  and the expression pattern of targets of those si-rnas or progenitors in the interploidy crosses. the work presented here is therefore a step towards understanding the related phenomena of parental genome balance and imprinting.
