BACKGROUND
each cell in the human body includes many biomolecules, which continuously communicate with each other  <cit> . intracellular signaling networks transmit signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus, via biochemical interactions. the goal is to regulate some target molecules, to properly control the cell function. this regulation of the target molecules occurs through communication of several intermediate molecules that convey specific signals originated from the cell membrane to the specific target outputs. signaling networks have been studied in a number of different contexts  <cit> – <cit> . from a communication system point of view, in this study we propose to model an intracellular signaling network as a communication channel. the message which is supposed to be communicated is a signal originated from the extracellular matrix that tells the cell what to do. the inputs of the communication channel could be ligands which upon binding to the cell surface, create a chain of interactions through some intermediate signaling molecules. this way the message is propagated towards the channel output, typically a target protein such as a transcription factor, to produce an appropriate response. inputs and outputs of the channel can be considered as transmitters and receivers, respectively. in communication engineering, there are typically two types of channels, error-free and erroneous channels, which can correspond to functional and dysfunctional intracellular signaling networks, respectively. in an error-free communication channel, the message is transmitted without any error to the channel output. signaling networks where all their molecules are functional can be considered as error-free channels, which allow the cell to correctly follow its input signals and function exactly the way it is supposed to. however, in an erroneous communication channel the message becomes distorted and signal might be lost. delivery of the erroneous message to the channel output  results in the malfunction of the cell. this may eventually result in a transition from the normal behavior  to a dysfunctional system .

signal transmission in communication systems is accomplished via digital techniques, where different types of data and signals such as voice, music, image, video, text, etc., if not already in the digital format, are first digitized and converted to sequences of 0’s and 1’s  <cit> , <cit> . digital communication in an error-free channel does not face any transmission error. for example, the digital input sequence  <dig> can be transferred via an error-free cable channel to the destination, channel output, without any error . in an erroneous channel, however, there might be some transmission errors. for example, in a complex mobile wireless channel with significant amount of fading due to reflection and scattering via multiple paths, obstructed line-of-sight, etc., 0’s might be transmitted correctly, whereas 1’s might be incorrectly received as 0’s by a moving car .

in the area of systems biology, digital models and methods have been used for various purposes, and have also been verified using experimental data. the interested reader can refer to some review articles on this subject  <cit> – <cit> . they have certain predictive and modeling capabilities that are particularly useful in large networks, where information on mechanistic details and kinetic parameters are not available. some recent applications are discussed in  <cit> – <cit> .

inspired by communication engineering and signal transmission concepts, in this paper we develop a systematic framework to quantitatively model how the signals that ligands provide upon binding can be lost in a pathological signaling network, due to the presence of some dysfunctional molecules. we also show how the lost signals result in message transmission error, i.e., incorrect regulation of target proteins at the channel output. furthermore, we show how dysfunctional molecules affect the capacity of signaling networks and how the contribution of each signaling molecule to the signaling capacity and signaling errors can be computed. the proposed approach can quantify the role of dysfunctional signaling molecules in the development of the pathology.

RESULTS
a simple pathological communication channel model for the caspase <dig> network
caspase <dig> is one of the most important molecules in the regulation of cell death  and cell survival. caspase <dig> is a suitable molecule for the purpose of developing this approach for several reasons. this molecule has been extensively studied by several independent groups of scientists and the intracellular signaling molecules that regulate its activity are well characterized. moreover, it is either in an active or inactive form. caspases exist as inactive enzymes that undergo a proteolytic cleavage at conserved aspartic residues, to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme  <cit> . dysfunction of the caspase network causes the failure of automated process of cell death and eventually results in a malignant transformation  <cit> . signaling pathways from the input ligands egf, insulin and tnf to the output caspase <dig>  are extensively characterized and experimentally verified  <cit> , <cit> . having the biological data and information from an independent group will validate the outcomes of this study, as discussed later. there are seventeen intermediate molecules between the inputs and the output, which constitute the communication channel of this network. the input–output relationships for the normal channel, i.e., when all the molecules in the channel are functional, are summarized in a table , supported by the experimental findings of janes et al.  <cit> . a value of  <dig> or  <dig> for a molecule means that it is either inactive or active, respectively  <cit> . using the input–output relationships , the channel transition probability diagram for the normal channel is obtained .

now we introduce a simple pathological communication channel model for the caspase <dig> network . in this model, all the seventeen molecules in the channel are equally likely, i.e., with a probability of 1/ <dig>  to be dysfunctional. when a molecule is dysfunctional, its activity state does not change in response to its regulators. in this model we make a simple assumption that a dysfunctional molecule remains active,  <dig>  or inactive,  <dig>  with an equal probability of 1/ <dig>  this assumption could be easily changed to other possible probabilities of a molecule being dysfunctional, without affecting the proposed methodology. by calculating conditional probabilities , the channel transition probability diagram for this pathological channel model can be constructed . to understand the biological implications of the diagram, here we explain the arrows connecting  <dig> at the input to the  <dig> and  <dig> at the output, with the transition probabilities 3/ <dig> and 31/ <dig> written next to the arrows . each transition probability is a conditional probability of the form p that we have calculated in , using the total probability theorem  <cit> . since there are  <dig> molecules in the channel and they are assumed to be equi-probable to be dysfunctional, the chance of each molecule to be dysfunctional becomes 1/ <dig>  a dysfunctional molecule is assumed to remain either always active or inactive, with a probability of 1/ <dig>  therefore, the probability of each molecule in the channel to remain always active or inactive, irrespective of their input signals, is  ×  = 1/ <dig>  according to our calculations , in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases, caspase <dig> will be inactive,  <dig>  when  =  in our pathological channel model. that is why this transition probability is 3/ <dig>  the probability of caspase <dig> to be active, when  = , is simply 1 −  = 31/ <dig>  the dashed arrow in the diagram  means that when  = , the probability of capsase3 =  <dig> is 3/ <dig>  whereas the probability of capsase3 =  <dig> is 31/ <dig>  this implies that if, say,  <dig> molecules of tnf ligands bind to their receptors and activate them, then the number of inactive caspase <dig> molecules is 100 × 3/ <dig> ≈  <dig>  whereas the number of activated caspase <dig> molecules is 100 × 31/ <dig> ≈  <dig>  in this example, according to the channel transition probability diagram for the normal network , in this example  <dig> caspase <dig> molecules should have been activated upon  <dig> tnf ligand bindings when egf and insulin are inactive. however, in the pathological caspase <dig> channel, the remaining  <dig> inactive caspase <dig> molecules are the result of transmission errors occurred in the communication process because of the dysfunctional molecules in the signaling network.

now we calculate the transmission error probability pe for the caspase <dig> network. in the normal network , input molecules correctly regulate the output molecule. this means that there is no transmission error probability, i.e., pe,normal channel =  <dig>  however, in the pathological network , dysfunctional molecules do not allow the state of the output molecule to be correctly determined by the inputs. using the total probability theorem and by considering all the error events, we have calculated the transmission error probability for the pathological caspase <dig> channel , which is pe,abnormal channel = 11/136 ≈  <dig>  . this means out of one hundred  ligand bindings, on average eight caspase <dig> molecules will not be correctly regulated. from a signal transmission perspective, signal loss due to dysfunctional signaling molecules can be understood by noticing cnormal channel =  <dig>  whereas cabnormal channel =  <dig>  . we have calculated the signaling capacity by applying the algorithm in methods to the transition probability channel matrix, obtained from the channel transition probability diagram of the caspase <dig> abnormal channel . note that the maximum signal content that the molecular network can convey from ligands to caspase <dig> is reduced because of the abnormalities in the network.

a more general pathological communication channel model for the caspase <dig> network
to explore how much each molecule contributes to channel transmission errors and signal loss, caused by dysfunctional molecules, now we introduce a more general channel model. in this model the probability of each molecule to be dysfunctional is β. however, there is one dominant molecule such that its dysfunctionality probability is kβ, k ≥  <dig>  where k is the dominance factor. in the model introduced earlier in the paper k =  <dig> but in this model the dominant molecule is more probable to be dysfunctional. depending on which molecule in the channel  is dominant, we obtain different channel transition probability diagrams, which result in different transmission error probabilities pe  and signaling capacities c  .

similarly to the previous simpler channel model, we have calculated the transmission error probabilities  using the total probability theorem and by considering all the error events . moreover, we have computed the signaling capacities  by applying the algorithm in methods to transition probability channel matrices. the results will be discussed in the discussion section.

experimental data to demonstrate signal transmission error
we analyzed the experimental data of janes et al.  <cit>   to demonstrate the biological relevance of signal transmission error concept in a biological network. the data of janes et al.  <cit>  is a collection of protein levels or activity measurements of several molecules  which are plotted versus time . from a biological point of view and according to experiments data of janes et al. <cit> , addition of tnf induces programmed cell death  through the activation of several mechanisms which are eventually reflected in the increased level of cleaved caspase <dig>  a key caspase molecule that causes apoptosis . however, by adding il-1ra, the il- <dig> receptor antagonist acting downstream to tnf, the apoptotic effect of tnf is significantly reduced  <cit> . this effect of il-1ra is reflected in the decreased level of cleaved caspase <dig> . the antagonistic effect of il-1ra is reflected on the activity of the immediate downstream molecule ikk. as shown in figure 3b, addition of il-1ra caused an early fluctuation in the activity of ikk in the first  <dig>  hours but caused a steady decrease in the activity of ikk, compared to the case without il-1ra, after the first few hours. this continued to be the situation for several hours . the decrease in ikk activity after long term treatment is nicely mirrored in the decreased level of cleaved caspase <dig>  which again does not occur in the first  <dig>  hours after treatment, but appears afterwards for several hours .

from the proposed communication modeling point of view, the message is “apoptosis” that needs to be transmitted from the cell surface through a communication channel composed of several signaling molecules inside the cell. the transmitter is tnf, the receiver can be considered to be caspase <dig>  and the channel is composed of the molecules in between . activation of tnf by increasing its concentration to  <dig> ng/ml can be viewed as tnf transmitting a signal. this signal is then propagated towards its downstream molecule ikk . activation of ikk eventually appears in long term , which ultimately transmits the apoptosis signal, reflected in the increased level of cleaved calspase <dig> . this can be interpreted as the correct reception of the apoptosis message sent by tnf in an error-free transmission. adding il-1ra, 10 μg/ml, acts as an abnormality added to the communication channel, which distorts the signal sent by tnf and causes transmission errors. this can be understood by looking at the decreased level of ikk activity in long term . this eventually results in the decreased level of cleaved caspase <dig>  which indicates incorrect reception of the apoptosis message. because of this erroneous signal transmission, the level of survival has increased  <cit> . therefore, using the data available in janes et al.  <cit>  one can see that signaling through normal and pathological molecular networks can be explained using signal transmission and reception concepts in communication channels.

communication engineering analysis of a large t cell signaling network
using the proposed bio-communication methodology developed in this study, we analyzed a large experimentally-verified model of a cellular network described by saez-rodriguez et al. <cit> . this t cell network is composed of  <dig> different molecules,  <dig> interactions and multiple feedback loops, which give rise to a complex map of interactions based upon well-established findings from different studies on primary t cells . the inputs of the t cell network  <cit>   are tcr ligand  and two other receptors cd <dig> and cd <dig>  whereas the outputs are ap <dig>  bcat, bclxl, cre, cyc <dig>  fkhr, nfκb, p21c, p27k, p <dig>  p70s6k, sre, nfat and shp <dig>  this network is experimentally verified and characterized extensively  <cit> . there are seventy four intermediate molecules between the inputs and the outputs, which constitute the communication channel in the network . there are four feedback loops in the network, regulating shp <dig>  ccblp <dig>  pag and gab <dig>  according to saez-rodriguez et al. <cit>  there are some molecules which regulate other molecules but their own regulation mechanisms are not clear: card <dig>  gadd <dig>  gap, cd <dig>  pten, bcl <dig>  cdc <dig>  malt <dig>  ship <dig>  akap <dig> and calpr <dig>  we have similarly  <cit>  included them in the network, with their states  <cit>  specified in additional file 1: table s <dig>  here we present the results of the analysis of this network to show how the findings of proposed communication analysis method for the t cell network are biologically relevant and are also supported by the experimental findings of saez-rodriguez et al. <cit>  and other studies  <cit> – <cit> .

we studied the role and significance of each molecule in the t cell network , in terms of their impacts on an output node, such as shp <dig>  following the new methodology discussed above, we analyzed transmission error probabilities and capacities relevant to all molecules in this network, to identify molecules that have critical regulatory effect on the activity of the output node shp <dig> in figure 4b . similar to what is presented here for shp <dig>  transmission error probabilities and capacities can be computed for all other output molecules as well, and we only present the data for shp <dig> as an example. as shown in figure 4b, there are three molecules that are critically important for the accurate transmission of signals to output molecule shp <dig>  these molecules are gab <dig>  tcrb and zap <dig> that represent transmission error probabilities of  <dig>  and capacities of  <dig>  this means that for the correct propagation of message provided by inputs to the output molecule shp <dig>  the functions of these three molecules are very critical. in other words, the signaling capacity falls to zero if any of these molecules are dysfunctional. these findings are all biologically relevant and consistent with the experimental finding of saez-rodriguez et al. and other published literate. in more specific terms, critical regulatory effect of gab <dig> on shp <dig> has been established by several studies  <cit>  and deregulation of this interaction is known to be associated with chronic myeloid leukemia   <cit> . tcrb has been known as a critical regulator of shp <dig> for the past few years  <cit> . when we initially found the critical regulatory role of zap <dig> on shp <dig> through this novel methodology, we thought this is a prediction of this analysis that has not been known in the past and we were trying to confirm this finding by experiments. however, later we noticed that another group has recently published convincing evidence for direct regulation of shp <dig> by zap <dig>  by affecting both enzymatic activity and phosphorylation levels of this molecule  <cit> . this recent paper, which nicely supports the prediction of our communication analysis method using extensive experimentation is the first paper that presents a direct evidence of critical regulatory role of zap <dig> on shp <dig> 

in this large network, we also considered two case studies, two molecules, to show that the results of the proposed method regarding signal transmission in signaling networks are consistent with experimental data  <cit> . the model described in saez-rodriguez et al. predicted the signaling events after antibody-mediated perturbation of cd <dig> and after genetic knockout of fyn, which were subsequently experimentally validated. as shown in figure 4c, comparative analysis of this network in terms of the importance of pi3k versus fyn in the regulation of pkb  identified that the molecule pi3k plays a key role in signal transmission from the input molecules tcr, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  to the molecule pkb. this is because the transmission error probability increases, as pi3k becomes a dominant dysfunctional molecule . this prediction is in agreement with the experimental data of saez-rodriguez et al. <cit> , which shows when pi3k is targeted , pkb does not properly receive signals from the input molecules tcr, cd <dig> and cd <dig> and remains inactive   <cit> . in contrast to the dominant role of pi3k, the same proposed communication analysis method has determined that the molecule fyn does not cause signal transmission errors to pkb, when it is the dominant dysfunctional molecule  . this prediction is consistent with the experimental observation that when fyn is targeted , stimulation of the input nodes tcr, cd <dig> and cd <dig> still correctly regulates pkb  <cit> . this means correct delivery of the input signals via the network to pkb, although fyn is dysfunctional. overall, the proposed method has been able to correctly identify and quantify different roles of pi3k and fyn in a signal transduction network in t cells. these results are biologically relevant and consistent with experimental data  <cit> .

discussion
in this study, we proposed a method to analyze pathological signaling networks and showed that the presence of dysfunctional molecules in these networks can cause signal loss. this results in message transmission error, i.e., incorrect regulation of the target protein at the network output. we also showed how the proposed method can be used to compute the level of contribution of dysfunctional signaling molecules to the signaling capacity loss of the network. some critical molecules known to be involved in several disorders are correctly identified by this methodology, as discussed below.

as shown in figure 2a, the caspase <dig> network shows completely different behavior depending on the dominant dysfunctional molecule. for example, when akt is the dominant molecule, pe rapidly increases as the dominance factor k increases . this can reflect the critical role of akt in signal transmission over this molecular communication channel. in contrast, other molecules, such as egfr or mekk1ask <dig>  cause a small increase in pe, which indicates that they have less impact on signal transfer. the decrease of pe for the rest of the molecules means that even if any of these molecules is dysfunctional with probability one, there will be no transmission error . small values of the signaling capacity c for akt  confirm the significant role of a dysfunctional akt. higher values of c for egfr and mekk1ask <dig>  mean that their dysfunction is less harmful to signaling from inputs to caspase <dig>  compared to akt. large values of c for the rest of the molecules indicate their insignificance in this specific network, when they are dysfunctional.

transmission error probability introduced from a communication system engineering perspective in this paper is conceptually related to, but more general than the molecular vulnerability level  <cit> . in abdi et al. <cit> , molecular networks were modeled using electronic circuit components and a simpler fault model was used, where the dysfunctionality probability of a faulty molecule was always one. the pathological communication model introduced in this paper is more general in the sense that it allows a molecule to be partially dysfunctional, i.e., its dysfunctionality probability can be changed from zero to one, using the dominance factor k of the model. in biological terms, we have several pathological conditions in which a dysfunctional molecule is partially expressed. for example, in schizophrenia, we see almost 50% reduction in total protein levels of akt  <cit>  in the brain of schizophrenic individuals, while several other signaling molecules in this pathway show normal levels  <cit> . this means that the dominance factor k is nearly  <dig>  for akt. having the dominance factor k allows to examine the impact of each molecule on the network more precisely. with regard to the signaling capacity introduced and calculated in this paper, we can say it shows the maximum signal content that a signaling network can convey to correctly regulate target molecules such as transcription factors. if the presence of some dysfunctional molecules in a network deteriorates the capacity significantly, then the network fails to regulate its output molecules. therefore, one can use signaling capacity as an index to characterize the role of molecules in a network. a molecule which can considerably decrease the capacity if it is dysfunctional, can be the cause of significant signal loss in the network, and might be correlated with some diseases. the computational results show that a dysfunctional akt provides the lowest signaling capacity . this can be related to the crucial role of akt in the pathologic process of a number of common human malignancies  <cit> , <cit> , including breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid cancer, and cns malignancies , and other disorders such as schizophrenia  <cit> .

the proposed method can be extended to handle multiple simultaneous dysfunctional molecules. however, in practice, due to the large number of all possible multiple cases, it is not feasible to check all the possible cases. for example, in a network with  <dig> molecules, the total number of single dysfunctional molecules is  <dig>  in the same network, however, the total number of all possible single and multiple dysfunctional molecules together is 220 − 1 =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . besides the high computational complexity involved, the results might be non-conclusive, due to the extremely large number of possible situations. to avoid this, one can consider a subset of multiple dysfunctional molecules. for example, one can start with pairs of simultaneous dysfunctional molecules, to obtain transition probability diagrams, calculate transmission error probabilities, etc., following the proposed method. such study can determine which pairs of molecules are the most critical ones for signal loss in the network, when both molecules are dysfunctional. due to space limitation, we are not including such studies in the paper in detail. however, here we provide few case studies in the caspase <dig> network, to demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing multiple dysfunctional molecules. for example, when {akt,jnk1} is the dominant dysfunctional pair and the remaining molecules are functional, we obtain the transmission error probability to be pe =  <dig> . comparison of this result with pe’s obtained when only a single dominant molecule is dysfunctional reveals some notable characteristics. when {akt} and {jnk1} are dominant individual dysfunctional molecules, equations  and  result in pe =  <dig>  and pe =  <dig> , respectively, with k = ∞. however, if they are both dysfunctional simultaneously, pe increases to  <dig> . this indicates that simultaneous dysfunction of two molecules could be more harmful to the entire network, compared to their individual malfunction. the same observation is made regarding the dysfunction of {egfr}, {irs1} and {egfr, irs1}, since pe =  <dig> , pe =  <dig>  and pe =  <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study demonstrates how signaling networks can be modeled as communication systems. this approach takes advantage of the concepts of communication engineering and signal transmission, to model and analyze networks with dysfunctional molecules as pathological communication channels. the fundamental concepts of transmission error probability and signaling capacity are defined for intracellular signaling networks, and proper methods for computing these parameters are developed. application of the proposed methods to the caspese <dig> and t cell signaling networks provided biologically relevant findings which are also consistent with experimental data. overall, this study shows how signal transmission and distortion in pathological signaling networks can be modeled and studied using a new communication analysis framework. the proposed method allows to determine how much the functionality of each molecule in the network affects signal transmission and regulation of end molecules such as transcription factors. this can lead to the identification of novel critical molecules in signal transduction networks. dysfunction of these critical molecules is likely to be associated with some complex human disorders. such critical molecules have the potential to serve as proper targets for drug discovery  <cit> .
