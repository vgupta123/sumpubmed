BACKGROUND
crop productivity is significantly impacted by abiotic constraints, especially water availability  <cit> . given the expanding demand for water by urban populations  <cit> , crop productivity in drought-prone environments must be addressed primarily through genetic improvement  <cit> . the genetic basis of plant adaptation to the environment is complex and includes an extraordinary range of developmental strategies , morphological features , biochemical mechanisms , and physiological traits  .

sorghum  is an excellent model for the study of plant response to abiotic stress, particularly drought stress. with the exception of millet, sorghum is the cereal best adapted to water-limited environments and ranks amongst the most drought tolerant of all crops grown in the u.s.  <cit> . sorghum's drought tolerance is consistent with its evolution in africa  <cit> , which resulted in the development of heritable morphological and anatomical characteristics  that permit sorghum's growth in hot, dry environments. sorghum also exhibits physiological responses  that allow continued growth under drought, and adaptive mechanisms  that allow extreme drought tolerance.

a challenge presently facing plant scientists is to obtain the molecular knowledge and experimental tools required to identify the network of genes that condition crop adaptation to harsh environments. the interplay between drought and changes in plant gene expression has been intensely studied in numerous species including arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and sorghum  <cit> . recently, the metabolic interplay between aba and other plant hormones was implicated in a variety of plants grown under drought or osmotic stress conditions  <cit> . these studies provide insight into the relationship among drought tolerance, gene networks, and the metabolic pathways conditioning each species response to drought .

in the mid-2000's, cdna microarray experiments were conducted to examine sorghum's response to various abiotic and biotic stresses. these studies included the effects of peg-induced osmotic stress, exogenous abscisic acid , salt, wounding , and insects   <cit> . the recent release of a complete genome sequence for sorghum  <cit>  and the development of sorghumcyc, a metabolic pathways database , as well as ultra high-throughput sequencing technology  provide a unique opportunity to obtain a more complete view of the genes and gene networks conditioning abiotic stress tolerance in sorghum.

herein, we exploited rna-seq technology in combination with the sorghum genome sequence  <cit>  and the sorghumcyc metabolic pathways database to characterize the sorghum transcriptome and to reexamine the differential expression of sorghum genes in response to exogenous aba and osmotic stress. the present results expand on the sorghum cdna-array analyses of buchanan et al.  <cit>  by examining the expression of all currently annotated sorghum genes, providing evidence of the interconnectivity of drought-regulated pathways, and discussing the interplay between transcription factors  and the corresponding cis-acting elements upon which they act. we also employ the sequenced genomes of sorghum, rice, maize, and arabidopsis to explore orthologous transcripts from genes that exhibit differential expression following aba treatment and/or osmotic stress across species to investigate the possible evolutionary significance of genes of unknown function in abiotic stress response.

RESULTS
mapping the sorghum bicolor transcriptome
in  <dig>  changes in sorghum gene expression due to exogenous aba treatment and peg-induced osmotic stress were assayed by cdna microarray technology  <cit> , and, based on existing est resources at that time, it was estimated that the sorghum cdna array consisted of  <dig>  unique genes  <cit> . in  <dig>  the sorghum draft genome sequence and annotations revealed ~ <dig>  genes  <cit> ; upon reexamination of cdna sequences on the sorghum microarray, we determined that only ~25% of the reported sorghum genes  were spotted on the cdna array. due to the limited number of unique genes spotted on the sorghum cdna microarray, the present study readdresses the changes in sorghum gene expression in response to exogenous aba or osmotic stress using a global transcriptome profiling approach.

we conducted rna-seq on three independent biological experiments, each one consisting of a pool of paired shoot/root tissues treated with aba, peg or their respective controls . a total of  <dig>  million reads were generated across all three biological replicates. these sequences were trimmed to 50bp and aligned to the sorghum genome. of the total reads,  <dig>  million passed purity filtering standards, and, of those,  <dig>  million  uniquely mapped to the sorghum genome . most of the uniquely mapped rna-seq reads aligned to exons  with the remainder distributed among introns , intergenic regions , and splice junctions  . in total,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  million collected reads passed filtering and mapped uniquely to the genome, slightly higher than previously published results, which range from 38-60%  <cit> .

an upgrade in the software used for base calling after completion of the second biological replicate resulted in an increase in the overall number of reads collected, emphasizing the need for normalization across runs. quantile normalization was performed for each run and subsequently across all samples simultaneously  using edger  <cit> . the range of reads mapped to a gene was comparable across runs, with the  <dig> lanes of increased sequence counts displaying a slight increase in median read number per gene . the spearman coefficient of correlation between biological runs was high, supporting the reproducibility of the results . previously published technical replicate correlation coefficients range between  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> , centered in the range that we observed between biological replicates .

as reported by paterson et al.  <cit> , the annotation of the sorghum genome identified  <dig>  gene models, with ~ <dig>  of these considered bona fide, or high confidence, protein-coding genes following homology-based and ab initio gene prediction methods combined with est support from various cereals. the remaining ~ <dig>  sorghum gene models predicted from the genome sequence are considered low confidence  <cit>  due to a lack of any additional support. in the present study, we were able to resolve  <dig>  of the  <dig>  gene models as a result of the lack of strand-specific information in the rna-seq cdna. unless specifically stated, this group of genes is what we refer to as "all annotated genes". in previous studies examining the rice  <cit>  and soybean  <cit>  transcriptomes via rna-seq, transcriptionally active genes were defined as those genes with at least two uniquely mapped raw counts. when this same definition was applied in the present study, we found transcriptional activity for  <dig>  unique genes when considering all samples in all runs;  <dig>  high confidence and  <dig>  low confidence protein-coding genes, as well as  <dig> non-coding pri-micrornas  <cit>  . thus ~ <dig> % of high confidence annotated genes and ~83% of all annotated genes reported by paterson et al.  <cit>  showed transcriptional activity in the plant tissues and treatments examined herein. by comparison, deep sequencing resulted in verified expression of 79% and  <dig> % of the annotated genes in the combined  <dig> maize leaf developmental zones  <cit>  and  <dig> soybean tissues  <cit> , respectively.

of the  <dig>  sorghum gene models,  <dig>   did not have any detectable transcriptional activity across all samples indicating that either these models are not expressed in any of the developmental stages/tissues examined in the present study or the models do not represent bona fide genes. of these genes,  <dig>   are of low confidence, and  <dig>   are located in pericentromeric regions, suggesting they may be transcriptionally silent. additional transcriptome profiling across different developmental stages/tissues  and/or different abiotic/biotic environmental variables will be required to further assess the transcriptional activity of these genes.

differential gene expression determination and validation
to determine the appropriate read depth criteria for differential gene expression, we examined the data for trends , and a 2x median read depth cutoff in one of the two samples being compared  was chosen for examination of differential gene expression. this cutoff value minimizes the rate of false positives while retaining genes of lower expression. in addition, only genes having a log2-fold change ≥  <dig>  or ≤ - <dig>  and an adjusted p-value <  <dig> , as determined by edger, were included in our analysis of differential gene expression. these restrictions yielded differentially expressed  gene lists ranging from ~ <dig>  to nearly  <dig>  genes, depending on the tissue/treatment combination . among all tissues and treatments examined,  <dig>  unique genes were classified as de ; including  <dig>  high confidence and  <dig> low confidence protein-coding genes, and  <dig> models annotated as pri-micrornas  <cit> . approximately a third of the de gene products  are currently annotated as either predicted protein, similar to expressed protein or putative uncharacterized protein   <cit> , which reflects the need for further proteomics studies in sorghum.

to validate the differential expression data, we performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr  on randomly chosen mrnas that were differentially expressed in response to aba or osmotic stress. we conducted a total of  <dig> qpcr tests on a set of  <dig> de genes . overall, we found a strong correlation  to the rna-seq data ; all but one of the qpcrs that failed to correlate did so because no difference was seen between the treatment and control samples. when the qpcr and rna-seq results differed, they often did so for more than one control-treatment pair, suggesting that the location or design of these primers may not accurately reflect mrna accumulation, possibly due to variations in splicing.

transcript analysis in response to aba and osmotic stress
we explored the relative number of de genes in roots and shoots in response to treatment with aba or peg . in general, fewer genes exhibited altered expression in response to osmotic stress than exogenous aba treatment. following the  <dig> hr aba treatment, ~ <dig>  genes showed more than a 2-fold increase in gene expression whereas osmotic stress resulted in ~ <dig>  up-regulated genes . similarly, ~ <dig>  genes were down-regulated more than 2-fold in aba-treated plants compared to ~ <dig> genes in osmotically-stressed plants . this is not surprising based on the involvement of aba in response to plant stress, and its central role in other pathways, including dormancy in leaf  <cit> , bud  <cit>  and seed . when comparing the overlap in de genes between aba and osmotic stress treatment, between 12-30% of the de genes were in common between the two treatments depending on the tissue and whether gene expression was up- or down-regulated . when we consider the top five up- and down-regulated genes in response to aba, peg, or responding to both aba and peg treatment , we note that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes are considered to be uncharacterized or putative. as expected, genes similar to a late embryogenesis abundant  protein and a wsi <dig> protein, both of which are induced by water stress, and a dehydrin were in the top five genes up-regulated in response to both peg- and aba-treatment in roots and shoots, respectively. lea proteins are hydrophilic proteins induced by drought stress and aba, a subclass of which includes dehydrins . although their function is unknown, it has been suggested that leas act as water-binding molecules, membrane-stabilizers, and ion modulators . a gene similar to osigba010b <dig> , whose gene product contains sugar substrate transporter domains was down-regulated in response to both aba and peg in roots, and a gene similar to peroxidase  <dig> was down-regulated in response to both treatments in shoots. peroxidases comprise a large family of enzymes that function as antioxidants; as such, different peroxidases respond in various ways to drought stress  <cit> , suggesting some family members, including sb04g <dig>  may be down-regulated under water stress whereas others increase.

to further explore the genes responding to exogenous aba and osmotic stress treatment , gene ontology   <cit>  and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. enrichment analysis allows exploration of large datasets by suggesting that more genes fall within certain categories/pathways/groups than would be expected by a random draw. in total,  <dig> go categories and  <dig> sorghumcyc pathways exhibited enrichment for de genes based on significant p-values  or z-scores plus p-values  depending on the tissue/treatment combination being examined . examples of go categories exhibiting enrichment in de genes included those involved in biotic and abiotic stress, cell growth and development, hormone biosynthesis, and sugar biosynthesis . similar to the go analysis, numerous sorghumcyc hormone biosynthetic pathways showed enrichment in de genes as did pathways involved in the biosynthesis of osmoprotectants, sugars, and amino acids, to name a few .

while it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss each go category and metabolic pathway exhibiting de gene enrichment, several examples of tissue- and/or treatment-specific enrichment are discussed in more detail below with particular emphasis on the role of de genes in stress and defense response as well as possible influences on development. for those investigators desiring a broader overview of enriched go categories and metabolic pathways, complete listings can be found in additional files  <dig> to  <dig> 

aba and osmotic stress pathways in roots and shoots
go categories enriched for genes up-regulated in response to exogenous aba or osmotic stress in roots and shoots include responses to light intensity, heat, wounding, and hydrogen peroxide . additionally, genes enriched in go categories such as response to stress, cold, and water deprivation were also up-regulated in aba and osmotic stressed roots and shoots, although in some treatment/tissue combinations, certain genes from these categories were down-regulated as well. aba has been shown to play a role in the stress responses listed in these go categories , thereby supporting our results.

an example of a differentially expressed metabolic pathway common to both aba treatment and osmotic stress includes the choline biosynthetic pathway, which was enriched for de genes in roots and shoots based on go and z-score analysis . choline can be oxidized to glycine betaine, a strong osmoprotectant  <cit> . in contrast to the choline biosynthetic pathway, we did not observe enrichment for the glycine betaine biosynthesis pathway based on the z-score pathway analysis. this may be due to the fact that sorghumcyc pathways are computationally generated and populated by orthologous gene annotation .

as an alternate method to explore the influence of de genes on pathway function, we analyzed the ratio of reactions in a given pathway that contain de genes over all reactions within that pathway . we note that out of the two reactions annotated in the glycine betaine pathway, at least one contained de genes . the altered regulation of the glycine betaine biosynthesis pathway is therefore still possible if a rate-limiting step is differentially expressed. a related osmoprotectant pathway, ß-alanine betaine biosynthesis, contained de genes in all three reactions in the  <dig> tissue/treatment samples examined . in support of this analysis method, the ß-alanine betaine expressing members of the plumbaginaceae family have adapted to a wide variety of environments, including salt marshes and water-deficient locations, whereas glycine betaine producing members of the family have not  <cit> .

differential expression in amino acid metabolism pathways in response to osmotic stress and exogenous aba was also indicated by analysis of sorghumcyc annotated pathways. the proline biosynthesis pathways contained de genes in two out of three reactions assigned to the pathways for roots and shoots . proline is a known osmoprotectant employed by plants to enhance tolerance to abiotic stress, including drought. proline can function as a reactive oxygen species scavenger, protect and stabilize proteins, and enhance the functions of certain enzymes . in addition to the proline biosynthesis pathways, the majority of the reactions within the valine and leucine degradation pathways contain de genes in response to exogenous aba and osmotic stress . valine  <cit>  and leucine  <cit>  have been shown to accumulate in plants undergoing water stress, and their biosynthesis is auto-regulated by branched chain amino acid transferases  as these enzymes control both the last step in biosynthesis and the first step in degradation . although we did not find differential expression of the bcat homologs, it has been suggested that bcat expression requires both dehydration and endogenous aba, as exogenous application of aba alone did not increase expression  <cit> . although valine and leucine levels increase in arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and bermuda grass  <cit> , their turn-over rates have not been investigated. as the effect of the differential gene regulation on the accumulation of the products of the pathways, valine and leucine, is unknown, we suggest that the pathways are differentially regulated following aba or osmotic stress treatment of sorghum tissues.

several hormone biosynthetic pathways were also affected by exogenous aba and osmotic stress in shoot and root tissue. pathways for ethylene biosynthesis from methionine, gibberellin, ja, and brassinosteroid contain de genes in 60% or more of their reactions ; some of these pathways also show enrichment based on z-score pathway  and go analysis , although not in every tissue/treatment combination. a relationship between water stress and aba and ga has been reported in maize  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and arabidopsis  <cit> . seo et al.  <cit>  detail evidence, including increased expression of ga biosynthesis genes in the aba2- <dig> mutant, that supports possible regulation of ga metabolism by aba, which is consistent with the differential expression of gibberellin biosynthesis genes in sorghum subjected to exogenous aba and osmotic stress treatment.

cytokinin degradation and conjugating pathways contain de genes in every reaction within the pathway in all tissue/treatment samples , although only roots treated with aba or osmotic stress displayed enrichment for cytokinin conjugating pathways, and osmotically stressed shoots exhibited enrichment for cytokinin degradation by z-score analysis . several types of cytokinin conjugations, including the creation of cytokinin glucosides, can render cytokinins biologically inactive. studies conducted in tobacco have demonstrated that while the total amount of cytokinin rose under drought stress or aba treatment, the majority of the cytokinin pool found within the roots was in the inactive form  <cit> , suggesting an inverse relationship between aba  stress and active cytokinin accumulation. the present results support this hypothesis. arabidopsis and tobacco plants over-expressing cytokinin-degrading cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase genes display increased root biomass as well as increased survival rates after water deprivation  <cit> , reinforcing the link between decreased cytokinin levels and drought tolerance.

cross-talk between hormone pathways via associated genes is becoming a common realization in plants, especially in leaf tissue . considering a network based on sorghumcyc hormone pathways and their neighbor pathways  , we observe that few of the hormone pathways share overlapping de genes. only the brassinosteroid and ja biosynthesis pathways, and cytokinin glucoside and iaa conjugate biosynthesis pathways are directly connected via de genes . the lack of overlapping de genes within the hormone pathways suggests that if hormone levels are changing as a result of alterations at the transcriptional level, they do so in a non-concordinate manner. taken together, our data support indirect 'cross-talk' between the various hormones in response to osmotic stress and aba. as many of the pathways contain both up- and down-regulated genes often in equal number , the effect of differential gene expression on the pathway outputs cannot be predicted from the present results.

defense pathways are regulated by aba and osmotic stress in shoots
the 13-lipoxygenase  and 13-hpl pathways as well as the divinyl ether biosynthesis ii pathway were enriched in de genes in shoots following treatment with either aba or osmotic stress . in plants, the most common lox substrates, linoleic and linolenic acids, are converted into a variety of bioactive mediators involved in plant defense, senescence, seed germination, and plant growth/development . aba is also found to increase 13-lox genes in maize leaves  <cit> , supporting a common role for the 13-lox pathways in aba and osmotic stress response in maize and sorghum. two 13-lox genes in maize have been characterized and display distinct transcriptional patterning in response to aba as exhibited by differing peak response times, as well as induction of only one of the genes in response to cold, a stress response in which aba plays a role  <cit> . go analysis revealed enrichment for de genes in defense response, and abiotic stresses including heat, osmotic, and reactive oxygen species  for both  <dig> hr aba- and osmotic stress-treated shoots. in arabidopsis  <cit> , a shift towards a general abiotic stress response was also observed 6+ hrs after stress induction in shoot tissues similar to what we observe in sorghum.

aba and osmotic stress treatments mimic root disease response
examination of go categories displaying de genes in roots in response to aba or osmotic stress revealed a series of pathways that have been implicated in a plant's response to pathogen attack  <cit> . go categories enriched in up-regulated de genes in osmotically stressed roots and down-regulated in aba-treated roots included cell wall modification and cell growth, response to nitrate, ja stimulus, sa stimulus, and hypersensitive response. by comparison, the go category hydrogen peroxide catabolism was enriched for genes down-regulated in osmotically stressed and aba-treated roots . cell wall modification and oxidative stress response has been suggested to be regulated by ja  <cit> , and ja treatment has been shown to decrease the transcriptional activity of genes which respond to aba leading to an antagonistic relationship between the two hormones  <cit> . salicylic acid and aba have antagonistic roles in plant defense ; sa is induced in plants under pathogen attack, and the aba biosynthetic pathway is induced in the plant by the pathogen to reduce plant response . salicylic acid and ja enhance biotrophic and necrotrophic resistance, respectively, with possible cross-talk between the two hormones . salicylic acid, ja, and aba are complexly related in pathogen response, which is normally accompanied by an oxidative burst of reactive oxygen species  . peroxides are considered to be pathogen responsive and remove hydrogen peroxide from the cell . intriguingly, they also increase cell wall rigidity by cross-linking cell wall components . it remains to be determined whether the go categories highlighted in this cascade of events are solely due to a side effect of altered hormone levels due to osmotic stress or are part of a survival mechanism activated in water-limited conditions.

remodeling and growth in peg-treated roots
a number of go categories involved in growth and remodeling exhibited specific enrichment in roots following osmotic stress treatment. for example, up-regulated genes in peg-treated roots were enriched in the go categories for nodulation and regulation of epithelial cell differentiation, whereas down-regulated genes were enriched in the go categories of lateral root development and nitrate transport . these results support a well-established role for root remodeling in response to osmotic stress  <cit> . genes down-regulated in response to osmotic stress display enrichment for auxin efflux, phosphate transport, and lateral root development . low phosphate increases lateral root development and reduces primary root elongation through altered auxin distribution  <cit> , suggesting an alteration in root architecture in osmotic-stressed roots. enhanced root growth and drought tolerance were associated with reduced cytokinin levels in arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> , and we observed enrichment for cytokinin glucoside biosynthesis in roots treated with peg , suggesting that osmotic stress may play a role in root remodeling and growth in sorghum.

transcriptional regulation of differentially expressed genes
aba-responsive elements   <cit> , dehydration-responsive elements   <cit> , and low-temperature-responsive elements   <cit>  are known to regulate gene expression in response to aba, drought, and cold stress, respectively. given that genes in our de lists were alternatively expressed due to the presence of aba or osmotic stress, we searched  <dig> bp upstream of all sorghum genes for the presence of cis-acting elements found within plantcare   <cit>  and place   <cit> , and highlighted those elements that are known to be involved in aba and drought response and those that support the models of gene interaction supported by our go and sorghumcyc analysis.

transcription factor analysis revealed that the ap2-erebp tf family is over-represented in de genes from shoots following aba treatment . the ap2-erebp tf family consists of several subgroups including dehydration-responsive element binding proteins , ethylene response factors , apetela <dig> -related proteins, as well as those related to abi3/vp <dig> , which contain both ap <dig> and b <dig> motifs . genes up-regulated in shoots following aba-treatment are also enriched for cis-elements including the dehydration-responsive elements dre2corezmrab <dig> and drecrtcoreat, as well as rav1bat, a binding site for rav <dig>  a member of the ap2-erepb tf . ap2-erebp tf family members play roles in response to both hormones  and drought stress , and our cis-element enrichment analysis supports similar claims in sorghum.

sugar-repressive motifs were enriched in genes down-regulated in shoots by aba and osmotic stress . sugar production increases in arabidopsis, rice and other plants exposed to osmotic stress , and enrichment of sugar-repressive motifs in genes down-regulated by osmotic stress is consistent with this observation.

although several of the same cis-elements are enriched across all samples, few transcription factors are highly expressed in common between roots and shoots after exogenous aba- and osmotic stress treatment. a small set of  <dig> tfs are up-regulated in all tissue/treatment combinations that include bzip - sb04g034190; c3h - sb09g <dig>  sb03g003110; hsf - sb03g <dig>  sb10g021800; and myb-related - sb03g <dig> . abf <dig> , the arabidopsis homolog of sb04g <dig> , is up-regulated in response to drought  <cit>  and aba-treatment and plays a role in glucose response as well as salt, heat, and oxidative stress tolerance  <cit> . atozf <dig>  is the homolog to both sb09g <dig> and sb03g <dig>  and atozf <dig> mrna accumulation is enhanced when seedlings are exposed to aba, salt, and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . atozf <dig> has recently been shown to localize in or attach to the plasma membrane and improve oxidative stress resistance by enhancing the transcription of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>  and glutathione s-transferase tau  <dig> , two antioxidant enzymes  <cit> . the functions of homologs to sb03g <dig>  sb10g <dig>  and sb03g <dig> have not been investigated.

combining information from plntfdb  <cit> , planttfdb  <cit> , and grasstfdb  <cit> , sorghum contains  <dig> tf families and  <dig> unique genes,  <dig> of which are assigned to more than one tf family. in examining specific tissue/treatment combinations, aba-treated roots displayed the greatest change in tfs with expression of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . approximately 50% of the differentially expressed tfs, whether up- or down-regulated, were specific for a given tissue/treatment combination . the ap2-erf family of tfs is the most altered in expression when sorghum seedlings are exposed to aba or osmotic stress . this family of tfs has been shown to respond to a diverse array of biotic and abiotic stresses in rice  <cit> . furthermore, the overexpression of members of this tf family in rice  <cit> , trifolium alexandrinum l.  <cit> , and tobacco  <cit>  resulted in an increased tolerance to salt and drought in transgenic plants.

gene products of unknown function across plant species are differentially expressed in response to abiotic stress
given the advances in genomic technology platforms, the unique ability to compare transcriptomes across several species can be exploited to cross-reference information concerning genes and gene function. lists of alternatively expressed genes in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and arabidopsis  <cit>  under various forms of drought stress have been published. many of these de genes were of unknown function. we hypothesize that orthologs exist between genes of unknown function across species, and that a subset of these orthologs will be differentially expressed in response to abiotic stress. we compared orthologs of sorghum, rice, maize, and arabidopsis   <cit> , cross-referenced published drought-responsive species-specific gene lists  <cit> , and identified genes of unknown function . we were interested in genes of unknown function that respond differentially under osmotic stress and therefore did not filter our results based on directionality of the gene expression in response to drought as the published gene lists were created under various severities of drought  <cit> , using different technologies  <cit> , and the species considered respond differently to water-limited conditions. when sorghum de gene lists were compared with the sorghum orthologs of published drought responsive gene lists from rice, maize, and arabidopsis, we discovered  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, respectively, of unknown function that were drought responsive . two sorghum genes, sb01g <dig> and sb03g <dig>  and their orthologs were differentially expressed in all four species .

to investigate these de genes further, we searched for stress-responsive cis-acting promoter elements by scanning 1000bp upstream of orthologous genes. the  <dig> sorghum genes orthologous to unknown rice genes responsive to drought were enriched for abres and cgtca-motifs; motifs that are involved in responses to aba  <cit>  and methyl jasmonate  <cit> , respectively . the promoters from the rice orthologs show enrichment for both sorlip1at and abre motifs . the  <dig> drought-responsive sorghum genes with drought-responsive orthologs of unknown function in arabidopsis are enriched for box s, involved in the wounding and pathogen response  <cit> , ccaat-box motifs, possible binding sites for myb proteins  <cit> , and abres . the promoters for the arabidopsis orthologs are enriched for a circadian clock motif, which is involved in circadian mrna accumulation  <cit>  . the  <dig> sorghum genes with orthologs in maize with unknown function and responsiveness to drought are enriched in abres, box s, drecrtcoreat, a dehydration responsive element  <cit> , as well as, cbfhv and ltrecoreatcor <dig>  <cit> , which are both involved in low temperature response . the corresponding maize ortholog promoters are enriched for the tga- <dig> motif, a known auxin-responsive element  <cit>  . due to the conservation of these presently unknown gene products, our results suggest that these elements play an important and ecologically conserved role in the response to water-limiting environments.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates the value of whole-genome transcriptome analysis generated by rna-seq for accurate quantification of gene expression on a genome-wide scale. through mapping more than  <dig>  million sequence reads, we established transcriptome data sets for sorghum subjected to osmotic stress, exogenous aba, or control conditions. moreover, mined in parallel with existing rna-seq resources from other species, this expression compendium provides a powerful resource for cross-species comparisons of gene expression and function. thus, our initial analysis provides insight into how osmotic stress and hormonal treatment alter gene expression in this drought-tolerant cereal species, and has facilitated an initial assemblage of cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors working in union to alter gene expression in response to these conditions.

concomitantly, we expanded on the previous sorghum cdna-array differential gene expression study of buchanan et al.  <cit>  by examining the expression of all annotated protein and non-coding genes, while concomitantly refining the methodology used to quantify gene expression. sequencing of the sorghum genome  <cit>  and development of sorghumcyc allowed for exploration of differentially expressed pathways, and an initial glimpse into the intricate involvement of metabolic pathway cross-talk in the cellular response to abiotic stress. the sorghum rna-seq data set represents a community-wide resource that will allow scientists to query gene expression and annotation, and provides an initial look at the cascade of global gene expression patterns that occur in response to water-limiting environments.
