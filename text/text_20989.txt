BACKGROUND
terpenoids are found in almost all life forms fulfilling a wide array of important functions. with over  <dig>  different structures described at present, terpenoids represent the largest and structurally most diverse group of natural products  <cit> . this biodiversity arises from only a few prenyl diphosphate precursors. terpene synthases , the key enzymes of terpene metabolism, accept these precursors as substrates and convert them into monoterpene , sesquiterpene , or diterpene  products, usually olefins and alcohols. due to their high volatility, many monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are main constituents of vegetative or floral scents thereby playing important roles in plant-insect interactions or intra- and inter-plant communication  <cit> . diterpenoids are in general less volatile, but also often function in the interactions of plants with other organisms. they are, for example, major constituents in the resin of different conifer species defending against shoot-infesting insects  <cit> . rice  has a large number of diterpenoid phytoalexins possessing antifungal activities  <cit>  and in maize the diterpenoid kauralexins were shown to be involved in antiherbivore and antifungal defense  <cit> . apart from this important function in plant defense, some diterpenoids are essential for plants. ent-kaurene, for example, is the precursor for the gibberellins, which represent an important group of plant hormones involved in various physiological processes .

geranylgeranyl diphosphate  is the universal precursor for all plant diterpenes. different combinations of diterpene synthases and p <dig> enzymes lead to the production of the great diversity of about  <dig>  diterpenoids known to date with the biggest group being labdane-related compounds  <cit> . the formation of labdane-related diterpenes is mediated by the action of class ii and class i diterpene synthases  <cit> . class ii diterpene synthases accept ggpp as substrate and catalyze the formation of bicyclic prenyl diphosphates. they are characterized by a highly conserved dxdd motif which mediates the initial protonation of the substrate  <cit> . the bicyclic prenyl diphosphates can be further converted by class i diterpene synthases which possess characteristic ddxxd and a nse/dte motifs. class i enzymes catalyze the metal ion-dependent ionization of the substrate, resulting in the formation of a carbocation which can undergo further cyclization and rearrangement reactions  <cit> . the carbocationic reaction mechanism of the class i enzymes leads to the large structural variety of the diterpenes  <cit> .

the biosynthesis of the gibberellins has been quite well investigated. their formation starts with the conversion of ggpp into ent-copalyl diphosphate  catalyzed by a class ii enzyme, ent-cpp synthase . subsequently, a class i enzyme, kaurene synthase , converts ent-cpp to ent-kaurene via a complex bicyclization and ring rearrangement reaction . while higher plants usually possess monofunctional cps and ks enzymes  <cit> , the moss physcomitrella patens possesses a bifunctional cps/ks containing two active sites converting ggpp directly into ent-kaurene  <cit> . in contrast to arabidopsis which possesses only individual cps and ks genes, both involved in gibberellin biosynthesis , the cps and ks gene families have expanded in other plant species. rice, for example, contains four cps/cps-like genes and eleven ks/ks-like genes involved in the production of a large variety of different labdane-type diterpenes  <cit> . here, class i terpene synthases not mediating ent-kaurene formation but generating other labdane-related diterpenes are called kaurene synthase-like enzymes   <cit> .

the tps gene family in populus trichocarpa has recently been characterized  <cit> . however, the focus of this study was on mono- and sesquiterpene synthases and only one diterpene synthase, the geranyl linalool synthase pttps <dig>  was described. in addition to pttps <dig>  p. trichocarpa also contains two putative cps and two putative ks genes  <cit>  which were designated pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  respectively. in the present study we investigated these genes and the encoded cps and ks enzymes.

RESULTS
poplar possesses two putative copalyl diterpene synthase genes  and two putative kaurene synthase - ) genes
besides the recently characterized geranyllinalool synthase gene pttps <dig>  the poplar genome contains four additional genes  encoding putative diterpene synthases  <cit> . a blast analysis revealed that potri.002g <dig> and potri.005g <dig> had high similarity to cps genes from other plants while potri.008g <dig> and potri.008g <dig> were most similar to ks genes. we were able to amplify potri.002g <dig>  potri.005g <dig>  potri.008g <dig>  and potri.008g <dig> from a cdna pool attained from leaf buds, leaves, stems, and roots of populus trichocarpa and the open reading frames obtained were designated pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  and pttps <dig>  respectively.

pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> share  <dig>  % nucleotide similarity and are located on chromosome two and five, respectively, according to the available databases . the high sequence similarity and the chromosomal locations of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> indicate their origin through the recent genome duplication event described for poplar  <cit> . in a phylogenetic tree, the encoded proteins cluster together with characterized cps proteins from other plants and are members of the tps-c family . sequence motifs characteristic for class ii tps enzymes and important for cps activity, such as the dxdd motif responsible for the initial protonation of the double bond and the edxxd-like motif that coordinates the mg2+ / diphosphate  <cit> , could be identified in both enzymes . in addition, both proteins contained a conserved histidine residue that has been described to mediate sensitivity towards mg2+  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of putative kaurene synthase- enzymes ) and copalyl diphosphate synthases . the phylogenetic relationship of putative ks and cps synthases from p. trichocarpa to ks and cps from other plant species is shown. the tree was inferred with the neighbor-joining method and n =  <dig> replicates for bootstrapping. bootstrap values are shown next to each node. tps-c and tps-e, represent established tps subfamilies  <cit> . pttps <dig> was used as an outgroup. ks: ent-kaur-16-ene synthase, sms: stemar-13-ene synthase, lpps: 8-hydroxy-copalyl diphosphate synthase, cps: copalyl diphosphate synthase, nt: nicotiana tabacum, cm: cucurbita maxima, at: arabidosis thaliana, os: oryza sativa, pg: picea glauca, potri: populus trichocarpa, sm: salvia miltiorrhiza, pp: physcomitrella patens

the close association of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and their high sequence similarity of  <dig>  % indicate that these genes evolved through a recent tandem gene duplication event . the encoded proteins belong to the tps-e family  and contain sequence motifs important for the activity of class i tps enzymes, like the ddxxd motif and the nse/dte motif for the metal ion-dependent ionization of the prenyl diphosphate substrate   <cit> . the proteins are most likely monofunctional enzymes as none of them contained both class i and class ii tps features .

a signal peptide prediction using different prediction programs revealed that pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  and pttps <dig> contain n-terminal transit peptides . although, regarding the subcellular targeting of the enzymes, the different prediction algorithms gave different results . however, targeting of the enzymes to the plastids is most likely as diterpene biosynthesis is known to be localized in the chloroplasts.

pttps <dig> produces ent-cpp and pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> have ks and ksl enzyme activity, respectively
to determine the enzymatic function of the putative poplar cps and ks proteins, truncated versions lacking the predicted signal peptides but still containing the n-terminal sxydtxw motif reported to be conserved in ks and cps enzymes  <cit>  were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. in addition, an ent-cps , a syn-cps  and a n-cps  were expressed to provide potential substrates for ks enzymes. assays were conducted using crude enzyme extracts or purified protein and contained either the individual poplar proteins pttps17- <dig> or combinations of those enzymes with the different cps mentioned above.

while no activity with ggpp could be observed for the putative ks enzymes pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  neither alone nor in combinations with syn-cps or n-cps, diterpene product formation occurred when these enzymes were fed with ggpp in the presence of an ent-cps. pttps <dig> converted ent-cpp into ent-kaurene and pttps <dig> converted this intermediate into 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane  and smaller amounts of ent-kaurene  and ent-isokaurene  . when pttps <dig> was incubated with ggpp, copalol was detected, as a result of the dephosphorylation of cpp. a comparison of the retention time of the copalol formed with those of authentic standards revealed that pttps <dig> produced either ent-cpp or normal-cpp . however, the fact that pttps <dig> was able to support diterpene product formation when coupled with pttps <dig> or pttps <dig> confirmed that the enzyme mediated the formation of ent-cpp. supplying pttps <dig> with different concentrations of mg2+ did influence enzyme activity, with ent-cpp formation being higher at lower cofactor concentrations . despite the high sequence similarity to pttps <dig>  no enzyme activity, neither with ggpp alone nor in combination with other cps or ks, could be observed for pttps <dig> . that a few amino acid mutations can affect enzyme activity has been shown for various terpene synthases . in all assays geranyllinalool formation could be detected, reflecting an unspecific dephosphorylation of the ggpp substrate. attempts to verify enzyme activity in vivo by using crude protein extracts from poplar roots and leaves were not successful.fig.  <dig> gc-ms analysis of diterpenoids produced by recombinant pttps <dig>  pttps <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  the enzymes were expressed in e. coli, extracted, partially purified, and incubated with the substrate ggpp. products were extracted with hexane and analyzed by gc-ms.  <dig>  geranyllinalool;  <dig>  copalol;  <dig>  ent-kaurene;  <dig>  ent-isokaurene;  <dig>  16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane

one amino acid determines the product specificity of pttps <dig> and pttps20
although the pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> amino acid sequences were highly similar , their enzyme product profiles differed significantly. while pttps <dig> produced exclusively the diterpene hydrocarbon ent-kaurene, pttps <dig> mainly formed the diterpene-alcohol 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane . to identify amino acids responsible for product specificity, homology-based structure models of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> were constructed. both models showed the three-domain structure  characteristic for the majority of plant ditps, with the catalytic site forming a deep pocket in the α domain . only one amino acid differed in the active site of pttps <dig> compared to pttps <dig> . while a methionine residue was present at position  <dig> in pttps <dig>  the smaller, more polar threonine was situated at this position in pttps <dig> . exchanging threonine  <dig> of pttps <dig> for methionine changed the product output of pttps <dig> completely. instead of quenching the beyeran-16-yl cation by adding a water molecule and thus producing 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, as observed for the wild type pttps <dig>  the mutant enzyme catalyzed a deprotonation of the ent-kauranyl cation resulting in ent-kaurene formation comparable to pttps <dig> . vice versa, the exchange of methionine  <dig> into a threonine in pttps <dig> resulted in a mutant able to produce mainly 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane and smaller amounts of ent-kaurene and ent-isokaurene in similar ratios as described for pttps <dig> . the mutant pttps <dig> m607a produced also mainly 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane. however, exchanging the respective threonine  <dig> for alanine in pttps <dig> did not alter product specificity in comparison to the wild type enzyme .fig.  <dig> substrate specificity of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  a model of pttps <dig> showing their three domain structure . b model of the aligned active sites of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig>  the conserved ddxxd motif is shown as blue sticks and the ndxxtxxxe/ddxxsxxxe motif is represented by purple sticks. met <dig> of pttps <dig> and thr <dig> of pttps <dig>  which influence product outcome, are depicted as red and yellow sticks, respectively. product formation of wild type enzymes  and enzymes possessing one amino acid exchange . the enzymes were expressed in e. coli, extracted, partially purified, and incubated with pttps <dig> and the substrate ggpp. products were extracted with hexane and analyzed by gc-ms.  <dig>  geranyllinalool;  <dig>  copalol;  <dig>  ent-kaurene;  <dig>  ent-isokaurene;  <dig>  16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane



pttps17- <dig> are differentially expressed in poplar
to furthermore characterize the cps and ks synthase genes, we measured their transcript abundance in leaf buds, leaves, stems and roots of p. trichocarpa using quantitative rt-pcr. comparing the four different poplar organs, the transcript levels of the analyzed genes significantly differed . the highest gene expression of pttps <dig> and pttps19/ <dig> was found in roots, showing about 3500-fold and 20-fold higher expression, respectively, compared to leaves. a quite strong transcript accumulation was also found for pttps <dig> in the stem  and for pttps19/ <dig> in leaf buds and stems . all analyzed genes had the lowest transcript abundance in leaves. while pttps <dig> and pttps19/ <dig> expression levels varied between the different poplar organs, pttps <dig> showed a similar expression in leaf buds, stems and roots with about 10-fold higher transcript abundance compared to leaves . the smaller cq-values for pttps19/ <dig> in comparison to those from pttps17/ <dig> indicate that pttps19/ <dig> were in general more strongly expressed than pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> . due to their high nucleotide sequence similarity of about  <dig>  %, it was not possible to distinguish between pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> in the qrt-pcr. however, repeated sequencing of cloned qrt-pcr products revealed that pttps <dig> was not present in leaf buds, only slightly expressed in leaves  and more strongly expressed in stems and roots .fig.  <dig> transcript abundance of pttps19/ <dig>  pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> genes in different organs of p. trichocarpa. gene expression in leaf buds , leaves , stem  and roots  was measured using qrt-pcr. pttps <dig> to pttps <dig> ratio was determined through repeated sequencing of amplicons. means and standard errors are shown . a one way anova followed by a holm-sidak test was used to test for statistical significance. different letters indicate significant differences between plant organs. pttps19/20: f =  <dig> , p = < <dig> ; pttps17: f =  <dig> , p = <0001; pttps18: f =  <dig> , p = < <dig> 



since it is known that herbivory often induces the expression of terpene synthase genes involved in plant defense  <cit> , we measured the transcript accumulation of pttps17/19/ <dig> in undamaged and herbivore-damaged poplar leaves to investigate a putative role for these genes in defense against caterpillars. however, the qrt-pcr results showed that gene expression of pttps17/19/ <dig> was not upregulated after herbivory by lymantria dispar, a generalist caterpillar feeding on poplar. in contrast, pttps19/ <dig> transcript accumulation was slightly down regulated after herbivore damage .fig.  <dig> transcript abundance of pttps19/ <dig> and pttps <dig> in herbivore-damaged  and undamaged control  leaves of p. trichocarpa. caterpillars were allowed to feed for 24 h on apical lpi <dig>  leaves. gene expression was determined by qrt-pcr. means and standard errors are shown . the student’s t-test was used to test for statistical significance. asterisks indicate a significant difference between herbivore-infested and untreated control leaves. ctr, control treatment; herb, herbivory

discussion
labdane-related diterpenes are important plant metabolites and are known to function in primary as well as in secondary plant metabolism. their formation starts with the cyclization of ggpp catalyzed by class ii diterpene synthases. the resulting cyclic prenyldiphosphates are substrates for class i diterpene synthases which form the final diterpene hydrocarbons and alcohols. we showed that p. trichocarpa contains two putative class ii diterpene synthases  as well as two diterpene synthases  with homology to class i enzymes. heterologous expression in e. coli revealed that pttps <dig> catalyzed the conversion of ggpp into ent-cpp while the second putative class ii enzyme pttps <dig> was inactive. pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> showed class i enzyme activity converting ent-cpp into ent-kaurene and 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, respectively .

the tetracyclic ent-kaurene is a universal intermediate in the biosynthesis of gibberellins, important plant hormones controlling diverse growth processes such as germination, cell elongation and flowering  <cit> . arabidopsis ga <dig>  mutants, for example, interrupted in ent-kaurene biosynthesis, show a male-sterile dwarfed phenotype  <cit> , indicating that ent-kaurene-derived gibberellins are essential for plant development and reproduction. ent-cps and ks enzymes are found in all higher plants  <cit>  and they have been identified and characterized from a number of mainly herbaceous species like rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . the enzymes pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> characterized in this work produce ent-cpp and ent-kaurene, respectively, and are most likely the key enzymes for gibberellin biosynthesis in poplar. thus, their identification and characterization provide a basis for further studies about gibberellin formation, regulation and function in this fast growing, woody perennial plant species.

the duplication of genes involved in primary metabolism and subsequent sub- or neofunctionalization of the resulting copies is believed to drive the evolution of plant secondary metabolism  <cit> . in general, plant cps and ks are encoded by single copy genes  <cit> . however, in a few plant species, gene duplication led to an expansion of the cps and ks gene families. in these plants, one cps gene and one ks gene retained their functions in gibberellin biosynthesis  <cit> . rice, for example, contains three cps-like genes and ten ks-like genes in addition to the single cps/ks gene pair  <cit> , and it has been shown that most of these cps/ks-like genes were recruited for the formation of secondary compounds such as diterpenoid phytoalexins. in poplar, a recent genome duplication event and a recent tandem gene duplication gave rise to two copies of the cps and ks genes, respectively . presumably, subsequent mutations led to the inactivation of one of the cps gene copies while the ks gene pttps <dig> evolved new product specificity. thus, pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> likely represent an example for the evolution of a gene involved in secondary metabolism from an ancestor that functions in primary metabolism.

both pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> are highly similar on the amino acid level but instead of producing only ent-kaurene, pttps <dig> produced mainly 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane and small amounts of ent-kaurene and ent-isokaurene . while the production of alcohols is quite common for mono- and sesquiterpene synthases, the vast majority of diterpene synthases produce hydrocarbons and reports of diterpene synthases producing alcohols are rare. one example is the bifunctional diterpene synthase from picea abies producing the thermally unstable hydroxyabietene as its primary product  <cit> . to our knowledge, the only diterpene synthase described to produce 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane is the bifunctional ppcps/ks from the bryophyte physcomitrella patens  <cit> .

it was postulated that the production of 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane results from a quenching of the beyeran-16-yl cation through the addition of a water molecule instead of double bond formation via a simple deprotonation  <cit> . modeling the three-dimensional structures of pttps <dig> and pttps <dig> enabled us to identify one amino acid in the active site which determines the product specificity of the enzymes . the conversion of methionine  <dig> into threonine in pttps <dig> resulted in a product profile nearly identical to that of pttps <dig> and the complementary exchange of threonine  <dig> into methionine in pttps <dig> completely transformed the enzyme into a ks like pttps <dig> . the larger methionine side chain of pttps <dig> likely shields the carbocation of the beyeran-16-yl intermediate and thus prevents the addition of a water molecule . in contrast, the smaller, more polar threonine residue might form a water-binding pocket and/or change the substrate conformation, thus allowing the addition of a water molecule  as well as proton abstraction at two different positions . however, the hydroxyl group of the threonine side chain seems not to be involved in the coordination of the water molecule as the replacement of threonine with alanine did not change the product specificity. a similar effect was already observed for ppcps/ks which produces 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane and smaller amounts of ent-kaurene  <cit> . kawaide and coworkers  could identify an alanine residue determining the product specificity of the enzyme. an exchange of alanine  <dig>  which is located at the corresponding position to threonine/methionine  <dig> in pttps19/ <dig>  into methionine or an amino acid residue with a larger hydrophobic side chain led to an enzyme able to produce only ent-kaurene, while other smaller hydrophilic side chains in this position still allowed the production of the alcohol. these findings indicate that this amino acid position plays a role in forming the active site cavity rather than being involved in water binding as described, for example, for an asparagine in the active site of a  <dig> -cineole synthase from salvia fruticosa  <cit> . interestingly, the amino acid corresponding to threonine  <dig> in pttps <dig> is strongly conserved as a methionine in ks of higher plants  <cit> . like for pttps <dig>  the exchange of this conserved methionine into a smaller alanine in the bifunctional ks of white spruce  led to the production of the alcohol 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane and smaller amounts of ent-isokaurene  <cit> . however, the mutated spruce enzyme only produced 40 % 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane, retaining most of its original activity in producing ent-kaurene, while in poplar the single amino acid switch had a stronger impact on ks activity. the fact that the exchange of few amino acids can specifically alter diterpene synthase product outcome is well known  <cit> . in rice, for example, the alteration of a single amino acid was sufficient to convert an isokaurene synthase into a pimaradiene synthase  <cit> .

the cps enzymes involved in gibberellin biosynthesis are in general characterized by a highly conserved histidine residue which leads to an inhibition of enzyme activity at higher mg2+ concentrations  <cit> . this effect has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for controlling the flux of ent-cpp into gibberellin biosynthesis  <cit> . although the ent-cpp synthase pttps <dig> possesses this conserved histidine and ent-cpp formation is inhibited at higher mg2+ concentrations , the similar expression pattern of pttps <dig> and pttps19/ <dig> indicates that pttps <dig> provides the substrate for both ent-kaurene as well as 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane formation . due to their general growth promoting function, cps and ks genes are reported to be constitutively expressed in different plant organs with the highest expression in rapidly growing tissues and lower expression in fully expanded leaves and roots while the abundance of diterpene genes for secondary metabolism is more restricted . although pttps <dig> and pttps19/ <dig> were expressed in all tested poplar tissues, the highest transcript accumulation was found in roots. however, sequencing of pttps19/ <dig> transcripts revealed that the ksl gene pttps <dig> accounted for more than 60 % of measured transcripts in roots , indicating a specific production of 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in this organ, probably supported by a high abundance of pttps <dig> to generate the precursor ent-cpp. a similar phenomenon was observed in stevia rebaudiana. in this plant the expression of ent-cps and a duplicated ks gene was found to be highest in mature leaves which was opposite to gibberellin biosynthesis, and both genes were concluded to be involved in steviol glycoside biosynthesis  <cit> .

unfortunately, our attempts to measure tps enzyme activity in crude poplar protein extracts failed. thus we were not able to compare in vivo enzyme activity with gene expression data. however, as a multitude of studies have shown that the in vitro product profiles as well as expression patterns of terpene synthases usually correlate well with the terpenes produced by the respective plants  <cit> , it is likely that diterpene synthase activity in poplar is also reflected by tps transcript accumulation.

the role of 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane in poplar remains unclear. the moss p. patens releases this diterpene alcohol as a volatile at a high rate, but nothing is known about its function  <cit> . as the terpene synthase gene pttps <dig> seems to be constitutively expressed in poplar, the 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane could function as an allelochemical or phytoanticipin. however, as we could not detect this compound in hexane extracts of plant material, the alcohol could also be the precursor for other yet unidentified compounds in poplar. ent-isokaurene, for example, which is also produced by pttps <dig> is a putative intermediate in the biosynthesis of oryzalide a, an antimicrobial compound found in rice leaves  <cit> . however, the diterpenoid alcohol 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane might also act as a signaling molecule as was already demonstrated for a bicyclic diterpenoid alcohol in tobacco which mediates the activation of defense responses in tobacco .

CONCLUSIONS
we identified an ent-cps and a ks in poplar that appear to be involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. the ks gene seems to have undergone a recent tandem gene duplication and sub-/neofunctionalization accompanied by a single amino acid change that was sufficient to turn the ks into a ksl. by allowing the quenching of the beyeran-16-yl cation through the addition of a water molecule, the major product was altered from ent-kaurene to 16α-hydroxy-ent-kaurane. while genes for gibberellin biosynthesis seem to be expressed constitutively in all organs, the ksl gene was highly abundant in roots indicating a possible function in specialized metabolism.
