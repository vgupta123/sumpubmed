BACKGROUND
angiotensin-converting enzyme  is a well-characterised zinc metallopeptidase that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin system  <cit> . through cleavage of a c-terminal dipeptide from angiotensin i to produce the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin ii, and through inactivation of the vasodilator bradykinin, ace regulates blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis. inhibitors of ace, such as captopril and lisinopril, are front line therapeutics in a range of cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial infarction  <cit> .

ace exists in two forms as a result of alternative use of promoters within the same gene on human chromosome  <dig> and mouse chromosome 11: the larger, two domain somatic ace  and the smaller, single domain germinal ace   <cit> . the latter is identical to the c-terminal domain of somatic ace, except for a unique region of  <dig> amino acids at its n-terminus. the two domains of somatic ace are catalytically active and each contains the prototypical zinc binding motif hexxh. in this motif, the two his residues are two of the zinc ligands, the third being a glu on the c-terminal side of this motif  <cit> . the glu in the hexxh motif is critically involved in catalysis, binding the activated water molecule which initiates a nucleophilic attack on the susceptible peptide bond in the substrate. recently, the separate three-dimensional structures of the c-domain and of the n-domain of ace in complex with the inhibitor lisinopril have been reported  <cit> . somatic and germinal ace are synthesised with an n-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved off in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and exist as type i integral membrane proteins anchored to the plasma membrane through a hydrophobic transmembrane domain at the c-terminus.

in  <dig>  we and another group independently reported the identification using genomics-based strategies of the first human homologue of ace, termed angiotensin-converting enzyme- <dig>   <cit> . like ace, ace <dig> is a type  <dig> integral membrane protein, however, ace <dig> contains only a single active site domain and consists of  <dig> amino acids. the gene encoding ace <dig> is located on the x chromosome. ace <dig> acts as a carboxypeptidase removing single amino acids from the c-terminus of its substrates, whereas ace acts predominantly as a peptidyl dipeptidase removing c-terminal dipeptides  <cit> . studies from knockout mice indicate that ace <dig> is an essential regulator of heart function  <cit>  and is involved in the tissue response to injury  <cit> . ace <dig> is also the receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus  <cit> . homology modelling of the active site of ace <dig> on the crystal structure of the c-domain of ace  <cit>  and the subsequent elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the extracellular domain of ace <dig>  <cit>  revealed that the catalytic mechanism of ace <dig> closely resembles that of ace. however, the substrate-binding pockets differ significantly explaining the differences in substrate specificity between the two enzymes and the failure of ace inhibitors to bind to and inhibit ace <dig>  <cit> .

ace-like proteins also occur in non-mammalian species  <cit> . drosophila melanogaster has two functionally active, single domain, soluble ace-like proteins  that share 36% amino acid sequence identity with human ace  <cit> . there are four other ace-like genes in d. melanogaster that encode proteins which are predicted to be catalytically inactive as they lack critical residues involved in zinc binding or catalysis  <cit> . in the mosquito anopheles gambiae there are  <dig> genes which code for proteins with similarity to mammalian ace  <cit> , while in caenorhabditis elegans there is a single ace-like gene which also encodes a protein that is predicted to be catalytically inactive  <cit> . orthologues of ace <dig> have been described recently in a range of non-mammalian vertebrates  <cit> .

in this study we have identified and characterised a gene in the genomes of several mammalian species that encodes a novel, single domain ace-like protein, that we have termed ace <dig>  in mouse, rat, cow and dog ace <dig>  the catalytic glu is replaced by gln  in the putative zinc binding motif, indicating that in these species ace <dig> would lack catalytic activity as a zinc metalloprotease. in humans, we could find no evidence that the ace <dig> gene is expressed and the presence of deletions and insertions in the sequence indicate that in humans ace <dig> is a pseudogene.

RESULTS
predicted ace <dig> sequences in mouse, rat, dog and cow genomes
blast searches using human somatic ace against the mouse genome and gene prediction programmes on the ncbi and ensembl databases identified a potential homologous region on chromosome  <dig>  downstream of the ace gene.

the murine ace <dig> gene consists of  <dig> nucleotides which encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids . hydropathy analysis and transmembrane prediction revealed two hydrophobic regions at the c-terminus of the protein but no n-terminal signal peptide. the predicted amino acid sequence of murine ace <dig> exhibits significant homology to existing members of the ace family , with the highest percentage identity  to the c-terminal domain of murine somatic ace. in murine ace <dig>  the hemgh zinc binding motif characteristic of other members of the ace family was hqmgh . predicted ace <dig> sequences were identified also in the rat, dog and cow genomes . these sequences are more closely related amongst each other than to ace sharing 81%, 65% and 58% sequence identity with murine ace <dig> in the case of rat, cow and dog, respectively. they all contain the hqmgh motif characteristic of mouse ace <dig>  however, neither the cow nor dog ace <dig> predicted sequences contain an n-terminal signal peptide, although the rat ace <dig> predicted sequence does. both the rat and cow ace <dig> sequences contain a predicted c-terminal transmembrane region, whereas the dog ace <dig> lacks such a region.

the catalytic peptidase m <dig> domains  <cit>  of murine ace , ace <dig> and ace <dig> were aligned with each other using needle  <cit>  and the percentage identity deduced.

genomic sequence analysis of the murine ace <dig> gene
the predicted murine ace <dig> protein sequence was mapped onto the genomic dna and the intron-exon boundaries determined. the murine ace <dig> gene contains  <dig> exons, interspersed with  <dig> introns, spans  <dig>  kb and is located  <dig>  kb downstream of the ace gene . in the ace <dig> gene, all the intron-exon junction sequences follow the gt/ga rule . exon  <dig> contains the hqmgh motif. the predicted ace <dig> genes in rat, dog and cow are also located on the same chromosome as ace, always downstream and in close proximity. a tblastn search of ace <dig> against the annotated mouse genome at the ncbi only detected significant homology with ace  and ace <dig> . no other hit exists with an e-value of less than  <dig> . this indicates that there is no further closely related homologue of ace <dig>  other than ace and ace <dig>  in the mouse genome.

lower case letters denote exon sequences; intron sequences are in upper case letters. the codon phase indicates the position of the intron in the codon triplet. o intron occurs between codons, i intron occurs after the first nucleotide, and ii intron occurs after the second nucleotide in the codon.

expression of ace <dig> in murine tissues
the expression of the mrna encoding ace <dig> was examined in several murine tissues. rt-pcr using selective primers was performed on a panel of total rna samples from different tissues . a transcript encoding ace <dig> was detected in testis, heart and embryo, but not in a range of other tissues, including, kidney, lung, and liver. although a larger rt-pcr product was identified in the brain rna sample, on sequencing this was found not to correspond to ace <dig> 

modelling of the substrate binding site of murine ace3
the predicted murine ace <dig> sequence was modelled on the c-terminal domain of human somatic ace  <cit> . overall, both the fold and active site in murine ace <dig> are highly conserved as compared to human ace . however, several substitutions occur in the ace <dig> predicted active site, some of which are unique to ace <dig> family members  . the most significant substitution is unquestionably glu <dig> to gln that replaces the catalytic glu in the hexxh zinc binding motif. comparison of residues surrounding the proposed transition state of ace  <cit>  show why this substitution could be so detrimental to the ability of ace <dig> to act as a protease . ionized glu <dig> is proposed to stabilise the positively charged amine intermediate and act as a proton acceptor/donor in the ace enzyme mechanism. in addition to the gln being a poor proton acceptor/donor in ace <dig>  its involvement is further compromised by both the amide side chain atoms being involved in hydrogen bonding to two neighbouring residues, substituted from ala to thr <dig> and ser <dig>  respectively. another important substitution is asp <dig> to ser which affects zinc binding by interfering with the hydrogen bond network to his <dig>  the first histidine residue in the hexxh zinc binding motif in testicular ace.

genomic sequence analysis of the human ace <dig> gene
blast searches using human somatic ace against the human genome and gene prediction programmes on the ensembl and ncbi databases identified a potential homologous region on chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig> kb downstream of the start site of the ace gene. this third potential human homologue of ace was termed human ace <dig>  according to current annotation for the ace gene , a third ace transcript exists. alternative splicing at the 3' coding region results in a frameshift and a c-terminus that differs from the testicular ace transcript in the last three exons. interestingly, this transcript variant comprises another  <dig> exons in the 3' non-coding region, closely corresponding to the location of ace <dig> , suggesting that the ancestral ace <dig> may be a pseudogene contained within the ace gene.

the restored human ace <dig> protein sequence  shows strong conservation with ace and other ace <dig> sequences. it contains the typical hemgh zinc binding motif present in other members of the ace family and is 54% identical to the c-domain of human ace and 71% identical to the mouse ace <dig> catalytic domain, respectively. the ancestral ace <dig> gene is predicted to contain at least  <dig> exons, interspersed with  <dig> introns and spans  <dig> kb . all of the predicted intron-exon junction sequences follow the gt/ga rule . hydropathy analysis and transmembrane prediction revealed two hydrophobic regions at the c-terminus, in agreement with ace <dig> from other species, and an n-terminal signal peptide.

the human ace <dig> gene sequence, however, has several frame shifts and premature stop codons . for example, there is a one base deletion directly after the sequence encoding the hemgh zinc binding motif that causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. to confirm this deletion, genomic dna was isolated from  <dig> different human cell lines  and pcr performed using primers flanking this region. in all three cell lines sequencing of the pcr product confirmed that there was a one base deletion directly after the codon for the second his of the zinc binding motif .

rt-pcr was used in an attempt to identify potential mrna transcripts of human ace <dig>  however, rt-pcr using various primer sets on an rna panel that included total rna from human brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, testis, colon, small intestine, placenta and skeletal muscle failed to identify a transcript. the specificity of the primers was checked by using them to pcr genomic dna extracted from hek <dig> cells from which they amplified a band of the predicted size that corresponded to the sequence of ace <dig> . to date, blast searches of the est databases has not identified any ests for human ace <dig>  thus, point mutations that give rise to premature stop codons and the failure to identify rna transcripts or ests all suggest that human ace <dig> is likely a pseudogene.

discussion
in this study we have identified and characterised the gene encoding a third mammalian homologue of ace, termed ace <dig>  the properties of the predicted ace <dig> protein sequences in human, mouse, rat, dog and cow are summarised in table  <dig>  ace <dig> in the mouse, rat, cow and dog all contain gln rather than glu within the hqmgh motif. the glu residue is 100% conserved in all other ace  family members and the ma  clan of metalloproteases and is critically involved in catalysis  <cit> . when this glu was mutated to gln in either endopeptidase- <dig>   <cit>  or ace  enzyme activity was completely abolished. another important substitution in murine ace <dig> is asp <dig> to ser which affects zinc binding by interfering with the hydrogen bond network to the first histidine residue in the hexxh zinc binding motif. this residue is conserved among vertebrate aces and in other metalloproteases, corresponding to asp <dig> in neprilysin  and asp <dig> in thermolysin . in both ace and neprilysin, this asp was shown to be critical for catalytic activity  <cit> . due to these critical residues being mutated in ace <dig>  it is likely that in mouse, rat, cow and dog ace <dig> will not be functional as a protease. although the ace <dig> sequences in mouse, rat and cow all possess c-terminal hydrophobic regions, only the rat ace <dig> sequence is predicted to contain an n-terminal signal peptide which would direct the nascent protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and then potentially to the cell surface as is the case for ace and ace <dig>  ests for mouse, rat and cow ace <dig> have been identified in the databases and rt-pcr of multiple tissues revealed a transcript for ace <dig> in mouse heart and testis. in addition, a recent proteomic analysis of murine sperm regions that mediate sperm-egg interactions, reported the identification of a protein with the same gene locus  as ace <dig>  <cit> . thus, the available data suggest that ace <dig> in mouse, rat and cow is expressed, but lacks protease activity.

§refers to restored ancestral sequence as shown in fig.  <dig> 

within another zinc metalloprotease family, the adam  family, several members have subtle or more complete mutation of the hexxh motif  <cit> . for example, in adam <dig> the glu is mutated to ala, while in adam <dig> it is his. interestingly many of these catalytically inactive members of the adam family are present exclusively in the testis, where some have critical roles in fertilisation  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether ace <dig> has a role to play in fertilisation, although the recent report of its presence in membrane vesicles released by the acrosome reaction  <cit>  is suggestive of such a role. there is a further parallel between the adam family members and ace <dig>  in that a large number of the adams present in the mouse genome are pseudogenes in humans  <cit> . in the present study we could find no evidence for human ace <dig> to be expressed and the presence in the gene of multiple base insertions and deletions would, if expressed, generate a severely truncated protein lacking residues that are critical for zinc binding and/or catalysis in ace and ace <dig>  <cit> . this, and the localisation of ace <dig> within the ace gene, point to ace <dig> being a pseudogene in humans.

traditional, non-processed or duplicated pseudogenes characteristically contain introns as they are duplications of the genomic dna, whereas processed or retrotransposed pseudogenes are duplicated from rna and lack introns  <cit> . in addition, non-processed pseudogenes are usually adjacent to their original functional copies. as human ace <dig> contains introns and is localised to the same region of the genome as ace, it appears to be a non-processed pseudogene. such non-processed pseudogenes are often silenced by point mutations, insertions or deletions, as seen in human ace <dig>  this 'pseudogenization' of genes in humans, as seen here with ace <dig>  results in the human degradome containing only  <dig> functional genes, while the mouse degradome is larger with  <dig> genes  <cit> . interestingly, many of these additional mouse genes are involved in fertilisation and immunity.

while the ace <dig> gene being located on the same chromosome just downstream of the ace gene in all five genomes analysed may just reflect an evolutionary relationship, it is possible that this location alongside the ace gene may reflect a potential functional role at the genomic level, as pseudogenes can regulate the expression of a related gene. for example, the makorin <dig> protein is evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to mammals and encodes an rna binding protein  <cit> . normally makorin <dig> is expressed throughout the animal but the disruption of the makorin <dig> pseudogene markedly reduced the expression of the makorin <dig> gene. this implies that for normal expression of makorin <dig>  the presence of the rna for the makorin <dig> pseudogene is required. however, it should be noted that a subsequent report failed to replicate this finding  <cit>  and the technical problems associated with such studies are discussed more fully in  <cit> . thus it is possible, but remains to be determined, that the ace <dig> gene may regulate the expression of the ace gene.

CONCLUSIONS
multiple ace-like genes have been identified in a range of non-mammalian species and here we report the identification and characterisation of a third ace-like gene in the genomes of several mammalian species. this gene encodes a novel, single domain ace-like protein, ace <dig>  in the mouse, rat, cow and dog, where there is evidence that ace <dig> is expressed, the catalytic glu is replaced by gln in the putative zinc binding motif, indicating that in these species ace <dig> would lack catalytic activity as a zinc metalloprotease. in humans, although the predicted ace <dig> protein would contain an intact hexxh zinc binding motif, no evidence was found for the expression of the gene. this lack of expression, along with the presence of deletions and insertions in the sequence, indicate that in humans ace <dig> is a pseudogene.
