BACKGROUND
tumorigenesis by chemical carcinogens is a multistep process  <cit>  with accumulation of both mutations and epigenetic aberrations in regulatory regions of genes and disruption of cellular signaling pathways  <cit> . in particular, dna methylation at cpg dinucleotides is an important component of epigenetic gene expression regulation  <cit> , resulting in modulation of protein-dna interactions  <cit> . aberrant methylation of cpg islands  in the promoter and exonic regions  <cit> , and changes in gene expression, have been associated with tumorigenesis  <cit> . global hypomethylation occurs in most human tumors  <cit>  leading to potential activation of imprinted genes, parasite sequences and oncogenes and increased chromosome instability  <cit> . in addition, hypermethylation of genes associated with negative regulation of tumorigenesis, such as tumor suppressor genes , dna repair genes, and anti-angiogenic genes, is a common and key characteristic of neoplastic cells  <cit> . furthermore, a range of rodent carcinogens alter methylation status contributing to the carcinogenic mechanisms  <cit> .

fish have been used as models to study tumors induced by environmental carcinogens. for example, rainbow trout   <cit> , zebrafish   <cit> , guppy   <cit> , platyfish   <cit>  and medaka   <cit>  have been employed in carcinogen bioassays. zebrafish is a particularly well established model for investigating embryogenesis, organogenesis, environmental carcinogenesis and for modeling human diseases such as cancer  <cit> . chemically-induced tumors in zebrafish and tumors in humans are histopathologically very similar  <cit>  and orthologous tsgs and oncogenes in human and fish have been identified  <cit> . recent studies comparing hepatic gene expression in human and zebrafish tumors demonstrated conservation of gene expression profiles at different stages of tumor aggressiveness between these two phylogenetically distant species  <cit> . however, the contribution of altered methylation to such changes is unknown.

although there are reports on global levels of methylation during embryogenesis or in adults  <cit> , effect of temperature on global levels of methylation  <cit>  methylation profiling in zebrafish embryo  <cit>  and role of chromatin mediated gene regulation during embryogenesis  <cit> , to our knowledge no study has been published on the dna methylation patterns or methylation changes associated with carcinogenesis in adult zebrafish. therefore, the aims of the study were to achieve a comprehensive mapping of zebrafish hepatic proximal promoter cgi methylation in both normal liver and in chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma  tumors. we aimed to determine if there was a linkage between methylation and the observed changes in the zebrafish hcc gene expression, and to compare biological pathways represented by altered gene methylation in zebrafish hcc with pathways commonly altered in human hcc.

to our knowledge this paper is the first to describe methyl-dna immunoprecipitation  in combination with a cgi zebrafish tiling array for establishing normal and hcc methylation profiles in the liver of any adult fish species. this microarray, in combination with well-established methylation immunoprecipitation, serves as a powerful tool for elucidating comprehensive methylation profiles. to further validate the data derived from the tiling array, bisulfite sequencing pcr was used.

RESULTS
global measurement of dna methylation
to establish the global level of cytosine methylation in zebrafish liver in comparison to mammals, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography  was performed . absence of rna contamination was confirmed using uracil as a reference material. as shown in figure 1b, zebrafish liver has a statistically significant  <dig>  fold higher methylation level  than that of calf  thymus. this is in agreement with previous published data showing higher levels of dna methylation in fish compared to mammals  <cit> .

unbiased enrichment of methylated dna using methyl-dna immunoprecipitation 
to optimize and test the specificity of the immunoprecipitation method, cgi regions of  <dig> genes  located  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of transcriptional start sites  were screened for methylation of cytosine using bisulfite sequencing pcr . following bisulfite treatment and sequencing of the  <dig> genes, cgis located at the promoter region of the "no-tail"  gene were found to be completely methylated while the remaining  <dig> genes, including glutathione s- transferase p <dig> , were completely un-methylated . the no-tail gene and the glutathione s-transferase p <dig> gene were thus used as fully methylated  and un-methylated  dna regions for validating the immunoprecipitation enrichment method.

dna was immunoprecipitated and bisulfite-treated. equal amounts of immunoprecipitated, bisulfite-treated dna were amplified for the two genes of interest. the gel images achieved indicated a clear enrichment of methylated ntla gene in comparison to un-methylated glutathione s-transferase p <dig> using 5-methyl cytosine antibody .

design of cgi  zebrafish tiling array and comprehensive mapping of adult zebrafish liver
probes  were designed to cover the cgis located  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of the tss of  <dig>  genes. a list of genes with predicted cgis, number of cgis for each chromosome and location on the chromosome are presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  where possible, 60-mer probes were tiled over the cgis with  <dig> bp spacing, covering the entire region . the negative control consisted of pcr amplified genomic dna, immunoprecipitated and labeled with cy- <dig>  as methylation is removed during amplification little dna was precipitated as expected. a uniform low intensity signal was measured for all probes represented on the array  representing non-specific binding of dna to the 5-methylcytosine antibody. the positive control was achieved by treatment of dna with cpg methyltransferase  in the presence of s-adenosylmethionine  prior to medip. this resulted in complete methylation of all cgis and detection of a uniformly high fluorescent signal for all probes . using our cgi tiling array we achieved a comprehensive mapping of the dna methylation at cgis in adult zebrafish liver at the  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of gene tss. the list of all genes on the tiling array and their methylation levels are presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  those genes with values  <dig> fold above the median level  and  <dig> fold below the median level  in control are highlighted. gene ontology analysis using blast2go identified go terms significantly  <5%) over-represented amongst lower- and higher-methylated genes in control samples. for lower methylated genes, the go terms were related particularly to involvement in hormone secretion, cellular response to hormone stimulation, regulation of transcription, sex determination , and regulation of apoptosis . higher methylated genes included those involved in molecular transducer activity and the connexin complex .

methylation analysis of zebrafish hepatocellular carcinoma and comparison to gene expression
dna extracted from zebrafish hcc was processed by medip, labeled with fluorescent cy5-dctp and hybridized to the tiling array against input genomic dna. following quality checks and normalization, probes were mapped onto the chromosomes and two lists, containing hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions in comparison to control, were generated . it was apparent that most differentially methylated regions in hcc were hypomethylated  in comparison to  <dig> hypermethylated regions. examples of genes relevant to cancer that contained aberrant methylation are shown in table  <dig> . using a principal components analysis  scores plot of differentially methylated regions, the four groups of hcc, controls, positive and negative control were separated based on treatment along the pc <dig> and pc <dig> axes . gene ontology analysis using blast2go was carried out to find changes in go term representation in lists of hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes. functionally related genes with statistically significant differential methylation between tumors and controls are presented in figure  <dig>  <10%).

a. genes identified as hypomethylated in hcc as measured by cgi-tiling array . b. genes identified as hypermethylated in hcc as measured by cgi-tiling array . full data is shown in additional file  <dig>  tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

in addition to blast2go, ingenuity pathway analysis  was performed to characterize the functional relationships between genes that were altered in methylation in tumors compared to control. figure  <dig> illustrates hypomethylated genes in zebrafish tumors  related to the canonical pathway "molecular mechanisms of cancer" in humans these included c-jun, shc and p <dig> 

ipa identified significant networks, top functions and canonical pathways associated with the differentially methylated genes for each comparison analyzed. significantly over represented  categories of functions for both hypo- and hyper-methylated genes in zebrafish hcc are shown in additional file  <dig>  tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

in a previous study  <cit> , gene expression changes in zebrafish hcc produced by the same chemical treatment were profiled. we used data from this study to compare alteration in gene expression with dna methylation in hcc samples. comparisons are limited to the genes represented on both the expression array and the cgi tiling array. expression of  <dig> genes that significantly differed between healthy and zebrafish hcc were investigated for methylation. from the  <dig> genes with altered gene expression,  <dig> genes had cgis at the  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of tss. due to the criteria used for designing probes, only  <dig> genes from the previously identified  <dig> genes were represented on the tiling array and were investigated for comparison of dna methylation level with gene expression. in total  <dig> genes were identified showing both significantly altered transcription and methylation  in zebrafish hcc . most genes identified were hypomethylated with up-regulated gene expression, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> , cell division protein kinase  <dig> , rab2a, member ras oncogene family  and proliferating cell nuclear antigen . ipa was applied to the list of genes that were significantly hypomethylated with up-regulated gene expression. the networks highlighted  contained molecules involved in formation of cancer, proliferation and transformation of cells in humans. for example, pcna is involved in formation of the replication fork and directs maintenance methyltransferases to the newly synthesized dna strand. mapk <dig>  capn <dig> and erk were additional molecules linked with human tumorigenesis.

confirmation of the cgi tiling array data using bisulfite sequencing pcr
based on the data obtained from the methylation tiling array, six genes from  <dig> different categories of hypomethylated, hypermethylated and genes showing no significant change between tumor and healthy tissue based on microarray analysis were selected for validation of the array data by bisulfite sequencing pcr . bisulfite sequencing pcr provided a detailed analysis of the methylation status of individual cpgs within the amplified regions  <cit> . the glutathione s-transferase p <dig> cgi, as shown in additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig>  is un-methylated in both tumor and control samples. following treatment with cpg methyltransferase  in the presence of sam, it became fully methylated . this artificially methylated gene was used as a positive control to confirm our semi-quantitative measurements of dna methylation.

direct sequencing of bisulfite-treated and amplified dna was used for measurement of average methylation percentage in a population of dna molecules. both normal and tumor tissues are heterogeneous in terms of molecular alterations and cell populations. as in this study dna was extracted from a tissue with a mixture of cell populations, complete homogeneity of the sequence data was not anticipated. therefore, the proportion of c/t was compared between samples based on well established methodology previously utilized  <cit> . direct sequencing of bisulfite treated amplified dna  provided an average methylation percentage at particular cpg sites in a population of dna molecules. this is in contrast to establishment of the methylation status of a cpg in one molecule achieved by cloning prior to sequencing  <cit> . the genes selected for additional analysis using bisulfite sequencing pcr  were coronin, actin binding protein 2ba  , insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1b  and angiopoietin-like  <dig>  , no-tail   and s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase-like  <dig>  and inhibitor of dna binding  <dig>  . the primers and annealing temperatures used are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  measurement of peak area for c and t at a particular cpg site and calculation of the percentage of methylation in four-dye trace sequencing data allowed a semi-quantitative assessment of the methylation level at the specific site. to compare the methylation status of the targeted area by bsp in tumor and control, the total amount of methylation for the region was measured and compared for tumor and control. bisulfite sequencing pcr results for insulin-like growth factor protein 1b, coronin-actin binding protein 2ba and angiopoietin-like  <dig> confirmed the changes observed from the tiling array . the three genes showing no significant difference in methylation by microarray also showed no change in methylation between tumor and normal samples by bsp.

discussion
to achieve a global non-biased enrichment of the methylated fragments of genomic dna, methyl-dna immunoprecipitation  combined with the novel zebrafish cpg island tiling array was used. this method enabled us to perform the first gene-specific large scale analysis and establishment of a comprehensive methylation map at cgis of the regions  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of the tss in both healthy zebrafish liver and in hepatocellular carcinoma.

regulation of transcription is a complex procedure. it is partly accomplished by formation of nucleosomes  <cit>  and by modulating the binding of regulatory factors and the transcription complex to transcriptional response elements, both directly and indirectly  <cit> . epigenetic mechanisms such as chromatin modifications, rna interference  and dna methylation are key modulators of transcription through different mechanisms, such as prohibiting transcription factor access to their binding sites and affecting the formation of nucleosomes  <cit> .

the methylation profiles of cancer cells are extensively distorted  <cit> . hypomethylation in tumors is associated with transcriptional activation of previously suppressed genes and is a hallmark of tumorigenesis  <cit> , where active genes are un-methylated with hyperacetylated histones  <cit> . as shown in table 1a, go terms associated with dna binding and transcription regulation were significantly over-represented amongst genes hypomethylated in hcc samples. genes including histone deacetylase  <dig>  dna -methyltransferase  <dig> and lysine-specific demethylase 4a showed significant decreases in their methylation levels in hcc samples in comparison to healthy liver.

comparison of the normal hepatic gene methylation pattern between human liver, presented by archer et al  <cit> , and zebrafish liver in this study showed a low correlation  implying lack of conservation of methylation patterns between human and zebrafish. however, our comparisons showed that, in zebrafish and human hcc tumors, similar gene families and genes involved in shared pathways are altered in terms of methylation. for example, zebrafish hcc samples showed methylation changes in genes involved in proliferation, cell cycle, metastasis, apoptosis, energy production, adhesion, stress, dna binding and regulation of transcription , similar to the biological processes that contain genes with altered methylation in human hcc  <cit> . several other genes from families such as abca, chst, dhx, kctd, megf, myo, npy, rnf and tbcid were found to be hypermethylated in both zebrafish and human hcc  <cit> . ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that the genes with altered methylation in zebrafish hepatocellular carcinoma were associated with biological functions such as cell death, cell morphology, inflammatory response, dna repair and replication and induced molecules involved in cancer formation such as c-jun, shc and pka. these functions and molecules are commonly altered in human cancers. we have associated changes in methylation of these particular genes with changes in gene expression during tumorigenesis. the changes in methylation levels of these particular genes and pathways could be directly or indirectly linked to their altered expression levels during tumorigenesis.

in our study, go terms associated with cell proliferation were significantly over-represented in the list of hypomethylated genes in tumors which is particularly relevant since an imbalance between regulation of cellular proliferation pathways and cell death by apoptosis can promote the development of tumors  <cit> . anti-apoptotic genes, such as bcl- <dig>  and their regulators, are often over expressed in human tumors  <cit> . our results showed a significant decrease in the methylation of a positive regulator of the bcl- <dig> protein, bcl- <dig> associated athanogene  <dig>  gene  <cit> . changes in anti-apoptotic pathways in zebrafish hcc were concurrent with changes in pathways of proliferation. insulin like growth factors  and insulin like growth factor binding proteins  play important roles in organizing cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation and are commonly deregulated in human tumors  <cit> . in zebrafish hcc, genes for several insulin growth factor binding proteins  such as igfbp2b were significantly hypomethylated. the promoter region of the human igfbp- <dig> gene is rich in cpgs and lacks a tata box  <cit> . it is therefore plausible that methylation plays an important role in regulating the expression of this gene. multiple complex igf-dependent and independent biological functions influenced by the tissue type and pathological status have been identified for igfbps  <cit> . an increased level of igfbp- <dig> protein has been reported in liver tissues and serum during human malignancy  <cit>  with a positive correlation to the malignancy status of the tumor  <cit> . in contrast to its normal role as a negative regulator of growth, increased levels of igfbps in tumors have been linked to enhanced proliferation, partly as a response to androgens and hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig>  protein. thus, anaerobic conditions as well as igf, can result in increased amount of hif- <dig>  <cit> . a lack of vascular supply at the early stages of tumorigenesis in highly proliferating tumor cells results in hypoxia  <cit> . under hypoxic circumstances glycolysis becomes the dominant pathway for energy production in tumors and glycolytic enzymes are induced. associated with this, the hif- <dig> protein, expressed in an anaerobic environment, initiates the transcription of several genes involved in stress and glycolysis as well as igfbp <dig>  <cit> . this is in accord with our finding that go terms related to glycolysis and hypoxia pathways were more prevalent in the list of hypomethylated genes in hcc samples. glycolytic enzymes such as enolase  <dig>  and hexokinase  <dig> showed significant decreases in methylation of their genes in hcc samples, indicating a potential increase in expression. increased expression of enolases such as eno <dig> and  <dig>  as a response to hypoxia and hif- <dig>  has been reported in human hcc  <cit> . as well as its function in energy production, eno <dig> has been associated with enhanced proliferation in hcc  <cit> . therefore, based on the functions of genes whose methylation was significantly altered in hcc samples it appears that there is a link between induction of igf, igfbps, hif, anti-apoptotic and glycolytic pathways  <cit> . this is similar to findings previously reported on gene expression in human hcc implying that differential methylation is at least partially causative of differential gene expression in hcc.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we described the development of a zebrafish cgi tiling array and showed that in combination with the medip technique, it can be used to detect and profile the methylation status of specific genes. we used this method to provide a comprehensive profiling of zebrafish liver methylation as well as establishing the methylation changes observed in hcc.

the methylation alterations detected can help to explain some of the changes in gene expression in hcc. there are striking similarities between the pathways disrupted by aberrant gene expression and methylation, both within and between human and zebrafish hcc. achieving a better understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation in the zebrafish will increase the confidence regarding the use of zebrafish as a convenient model for human disease.
