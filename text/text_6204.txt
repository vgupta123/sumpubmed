BACKGROUND
many researchers have studied the feasibility of gene expression profiling to improve the prognosis of cancer patients and have shown that gene expression signatures can better predict the outcome of cancer patients than conventional clinical criteria in many cancer types  <cit> . a few of the discovered signatures are now in large clinical trials to confirm their prognostic value  <cit> . however, there are also concerns about the usefulness of the gene expression signatures because several problems remain unresolved  <cit> . these problems include poor overlap among discovered gene signatures, the unstable nature of gene expression signatures, and poor performance of signatures when applied to other datasets  <cit> .

researchers have applied either top-down or bottom-up approaches to discover prognostic gene signatures  <cit> . most researchers have used the top-down approach in which samples are split into training and testing sets and gene signatures are developed by discovering genes that show a high correlation between expression and clinical information  <cit> . in the bottom-up approach, gene signatures developed from other biological models are applied to gene expression datasets to classify patients into clinically distinct groups  <cit> . one advantage of the bottom-up approach is that it affords a straightforward understanding of the underlying biological process behind the discovered gene signature  <cit> . similarly, the recently developed gene set enrichment analysis  and similar methods are promising tools for high-throughput data analysis. these methods enable researchers to identify significantly changed biological themes and pathways from gene expression data by observing changes in expression using pre-defined gene sets  <cit> . another method, named globaltest, was recently developed to test the association of a pathway with survival using gene expression data  <cit> .

a gene signature is useless if it works well only on the dataset from which it was developed. thus, recent work includes external validation of developed signatures as a necessary step that will reinforce the applicability of gene signatures to other datasets  <cit> . here, we suggest a simple but very effective approach to identify gene signatures that are prognostic in multiple datasets. rather than developing a signature from one dataset and validating it in other datasets, we suggest simultaneously testing multiple pre-defined gene signatures on multiple datasets to identify signatures that are prognostic in as many independent datasets as possible. by exhaustively testing all combinations of gene sets and datasets, our approach guarantees that the best gene signature will be identified among a pool of pre-defined gene sets. moreover, our approach will enable better understanding of the underlying biology of disease by observing the patterns of association between gene expression and clinical parameters at multiple gene set levels.

in this work, we applied a bottom-up, gene sets approach to multiple datasets to determine gene signatures for prognosis of breast cancer patients. we chose breast cancer because there are several high-quality breast cancer gene expression datasets with survival or recurrence information. our goal was to identify prognostic gene signatures useful in as many independent datasets as possible. for this, we collected  <dig> different datasets comprising  <dig>  tumor samples and prepared  <dig>  gene sets from diverse sources including gene ontology, biological pathways, and previously identified prognostic gene signatures for breast cancer. for each gene set, we performed survival analysis to test if the gene set could classify patients into clinically distinct groups. we also evaluated each gene set for the accuracy of outcome prediction.

RESULTS
selection of gene sets for prognosis of survival or recurrence
analysis of  <dig> datasets  with  <dig>  gene sets  including  <dig> gene sets previously identified as prognostic in breast and other cancers  revealed that many of the gene sets related to cell cycle or proliferation were best discriminating between good and poor prognosis groups. table  <dig> presents the  <dig> most highly prognostic gene sets identified by two-means clustering of samples. most of these top gene sets were related to cell cycle, mitosis, proliferation, and dna replication as well as gene sets previously identified as prognostic in breast cancer such as 11823860_st <dig>  17076897_adf <dig>  and 16478745_st <dig> . kaplan-meier plots of  <dig> datasets showed that the 11823860_st <dig> gene set classified patients into two groups  according to differences in survival or recurrence in eight of  <dig> datasets . because breast cancers are heterogeneous and may comprise three to six subtypes  <cit> , we also applied k-means clustering with k =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to each dataset to divide samples into three, four, five, and six subtypes respectively and performed log-rank test to infer the significance of differences in survival between the groups. again, we found that gene sets related to cell cycle or proliferation were best discriminating between groups with different clinical outcomes . the 11823860_st <dig> gene set, which was ranked as the first in two-means clustering analysis , was ranked as the first in four  and the fifth in three  and the tenth in five and six-means clustering .

unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios
we then calculated unadjusted hazard ratios for three selected gene sets within the  <dig> datasets . these three gene sets showed significant  unadjusted hazard ratios in six or seven of the  <dig> datasets irrespective of microarray platforms. for example, the sotiriou_ <dig>  wang, and pawitan datasets used the affymetrix u133a platform, the van de vijver dataset used agilent oligomers, and the sorlie_ <dig> dataset used cdna arrays. this confirms that many gene sets related to cell cycle and proliferation are prognostic irrespective of the microarray platform. we also calculated adjusted hazard ratios for the 11823860_st <dig> gene set in the three datasets  for available clinical parameters such as grade, lymph node status, tumor size, age, and estrogen receptor  status . the 11823860_st <dig> gene set proved significant even after adjustment for other clinical parameters in the three datasets, verifying that the 11823860_st <dig> gene set contains additional prognostic value over existing prognostic clinical parameters.

accuracy of outcome prediction
we then analyzed the accuracy of patient outcome prediction for each of the  <dig>  gene sets. initially, we tested five algorithms – nearest centroid, diagonal linear discriminant analysis , compound covariate predictor, one-nearest and three-nearest neighbor predictor  <cit>  and found that in our datasets nearest centroid and dlda methods performed better than the others  with similar performance to each other. for convenience, we used the nearest centroid method in subsequent analysis. with six large datasets containing more than  <dig> samples, we estimated the prediction accuracy of each gene set by external validation. we measured prediction accuracy for each pair of  <dig> training-testing datasets and for a total of  <dig> predictions . the best gene set was the gene set 11823860_st <dig>  with prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively . the individual prediction accuracy with the 11823860_st <dig> gene set was as high as  <dig>  when the training-testing pair was pawitan-van de vijver and as low as  <dig>   <dig> when the training-testing pair was wang-bild . the individual prediction accuracy was not related to the differences in microarray platforms or patient characteristics . we also analyzed the accuracy of patient outcome prediction with nine datasets with more than ten samples for each of the two groups. again, the gene set 11823860_st <dig> was the best with a prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively .

best gene sets for prediction accuracy differ from those for prognosis
comparison of the top  <dig> prognostic gene sets for breast cancer survival  with the top  <dig> gene sets with high prediction accuracy  showed only three common gene sets . interestingly, the gene sets shown in table  <dig> were, in general, from higher categories in the gene ontology hierarchy, including transferase activity , transcription factor activity , transport , and transcription . because gene sets in higher categories have more genes than those in lower categories, we reasoned that there might be a significant difference in gene set size between the gene sets in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  thus, we compared the distribution of gene set sizes between the top  <dig> prognostic gene sets for survival  and the top  <dig> gene sets with high prediction accuracy  and found a significant difference in sizes between prognosis and predictor gene sets . the sizes of the top  <dig> prognosis gene sets ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with a mean of  <dig>  and a median of  <dig> , whereas the sizes of the top  <dig> predictor gene sets ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with a mean of  <dig>  and a median of  <dig>  . the trend was repeatedly observed when we varied the number of top n prognosis and predictor gene sets  for comparison. the p-values by unpaired t-test to compare the difference in sizes between the two gene sets were  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ,  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ,  <dig>  × 10- <dig> ,  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , respectively

discussion
we have shown that a gene sets approach is effective in identifying prognostic gene sets over multiple gene expression datasets. we identified 11823860_st <dig> gene set as the best prognostic gene set for breast cancer patients.

our gene sets approach is fundamentally different from previous methods in that our method doesn't try to build a single gene set from gene expression and clinical data as previous methods did  <cit> . instead, our method begins from multiple gene sets and datasets and exhaustively searches for the best gene set among the given gene sets. as more gene sets and datasets accumulate, our method always finds out a better gene set than before. another advantage of our gene sets approach is that it assists us to understand the underlying biology of the clinical outcome because many gene sets are prepared using biological knowledge such as pathways, gene ontology, and protein domains  <cit> . in the analysis of breast cancer datasets, cell cycle or proliferation gene sets were the best for prognosis of survival or recurrence as judged by the log-rank test . this result is in agreement with many previous studies showing that cell proliferation signatures are the best predictors of prognosis of breast cancer patients  <cit> .

because poor overlap among independently developed prognostic gene sets has raised concerns over this type of diagnostic tool  <cit> , we examined the degree of overlap among the top  <dig> prognostic gene sets identified in our study. again, we found relatively poor overlap among them, thus confirming previous results . however, poor overlap among gene sets may not be as serious a problem as previously thought if different gene sets represent similar biological pathways and are congruent on outcome prediction  <cit> . this point was recently emphasized by fan et al.  <cit>  who showed congruence among four different gene expression-based predictors for breast cancer.

pepe et al.  <cit>  emphasized that strong statistical associations between prognostic markers and clinical outcomes do not necessarily imply good discriminative power of the marker. thus, instead of reporting odds ratios or hazards ratios, one should report an objective prediction accuracy to prove the usefulness of the marker as a diagnostic, prognostic, or screening tool  <cit> . as such, we calculated the prediction accuracy of each gene set using six datasets containing over  <dig> samples. we emphasize that we performed only external validation to avoid over-fitted estimation of prediction accuracy. while michiels et al.  <cit>  showed that five of the seven datasets they analyzed did not classify patients better than by chance, at least for breast cancer, all six datasets that we analyzed classified patients even though we only used external validation.

when we prepared  <dig>  gene sets, we included  <dig> gene sets previously identified as prognostic in breast and other cancers to evaluate their performance in multiple gene expression datasets. among the included gene sets are the 70-gene signature   <cit> , 76-gene signature   <cit> , 21-gene signature   <cit> , and wound healing signature   <cit>  . through various analyses, we identified the 11823860_st <dig> gene set as the best prognostic gene set in breast cancer. the 11823860_st gene set was the best in two and four-means clustering and also in outcome prediction . the 11823860_st <dig> gene set was also ranked high in three, five, and six-means clustering . the 11823860_st <dig> gene set was originally identified as  <dig> genes significantly associated with clinical outcomes of  <dig> node-negative, untreated, and young patients with an age at diagnosis less than  <dig> years in a supervised analysis  <cit> . but, in our analysis with  <dig> datasets, the 11823860_st <dig> gene set was also prognostic in independent patients with diverse clinical characteristics , which was previously confirmed  <cit> . also, the 11823860_st <dig> gene set was prognostic in most datasets irrespective of the used microarray platforms.

in van't veer et al.  <cit> 's work, 11823860_st <dig> gene set was reduced to the famous 70-gene signature by optimizing the number of genes for maximum accuracy in leave-one-out cross validation  <cit> . the 70-gene signature has been validated in subsequent works and now undergoes a large scale prospective clinical trial  <cit> . but, our results indicate that using  <dig> genes might be better than using the 70-gene signature. then, why 11823860_st <dig> gene set performed better than the 70-gene signature? one reason is because we included in our analysis  <dig> different datasets produced using diverse microarray platforms with different gene contents. in this situation, gene sets containing many genes are likely to perform better than gene sets with a small number of genes because a greater proportion of prognostic genes are consistently present across all platforms. indeed, the 11823860_st <dig> gene set contains many genes , in addition to  <dig> genes, involved in processes such as cell cycle, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis, and signal transduction, processes up-regulated in poor prognosis group  <cit> . the tendency of gene sets with high prediction accuracy  having more genes than prognostic gene sets identified by log-rank test  may be explained in the same way .

one concern in our strategy is that by taking a certain number of pre-defined gene sets, it may just happen that one gene set will turn out significant. however, because the two procedures we perform, log-rank test and the estimation of prediction accuracy, evaluate at individual gene-set level whether a gene set is prognostic or not, we suppose that our method can effectively handle false positive predictions. thus, even if a gene set is identified as the best among pre-defined gene sets, the two procedures, log-rank test and prediction accuracy, will evaluate if the identified gene set is significant or not.

many microarray-based molecular studies have been criticized as noisy discovery due to problems such as small sample size, inappropriate statistical analysis leading to over-fitting of data, lack of independent validation, or validation with too small set  <cit> . in this regard, our work sets a good example for microarray-based discovery of prognostic gene sets. we included more than  <dig>  samples in the analysis and applied complete external validation to avoid data over-fitting. thus, we believe that gene sets found in our analysis are truly prognostic in breast cancer and not just a noisy discovery. finally, although we focused only on breast cancer datasets in this work, our gene sets approach is equally applicable to other types of cancer or to studies that develop molecular signatures for predicting drug sensitivity of each patient to cancer drugs. we expect that, like gene set enrichment analysis and similar tools that have become useful for gene expression data analysis  <cit> , a gene sets approach will be useful for developing prognostic signatures for outcome prediction  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the gene sets approach is an effective tool for selecting a prognostic gene set as well as for understanding the underlying biology for different patients' outcomes. by applying a bottom-up approach with many gene sets, we could identify the biological processes and pathways that are important for prognosis of breast cancer patients. the importance of cell proliferation signatures in breast cancer prognosis has been repeatedly discovered, but our approach reinforces these previous findings  <cit> . additionally, our approach is applicable to other types of cancer in which prognostic gene sets are less developed than breast cancer.
