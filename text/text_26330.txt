BACKGROUND
mitochondrial dna  has long been treated as an ideal marker because of its convenience for reconstruction of gene genealogy and population history inference. however, the selective neutrality assumption of the mtdna is simplistic because variation in mitochondrial protein-coding genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation  can directly influence metabolic performance. because of the importance of this biochemical pathway, evaluating selective pressures acting on mtdna proteins could provide key insight into the adaptive evolution of the mtdna genome as has been suggested by recent empirical evidence . as amino acid changes cause inefficiencies in the electron transfer chain system, oxidative phosphorylation produces reactive oxygen molecules, causing oxidative damage to mitochondrial and cellular proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, and eventually interrupting the production of mitochondrial energy.

mutations in mitochondrial-encoded genes can influence the production of reactive oxygen species in mice  <cit>  and have been implicated in a large number of human and mouse diseases  <cit> . some amino acid changes may also improve aerobic capacity and adaptation to new thermal environments  <cit> . furthermore, mutations in mitochondrial genes have been implicated in exercise intolerance in humans  <cit>  . metabolic capacity varies widely among mammalian species  <cit> , and variation in the elements of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway have been linked to different life history traits and environmental adaptations  <cit> . in addition, functional interactions between mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded proteins may result in co-adaptation to maintain or improve metabolic fitness  <cit> .

the mtdna comprises a closed circular dna strand that encodes the following proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation machinery: seven subunits of the nadh dehydrogenase or nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex , the cytochrome b subunit of the ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase or cytochrome bc <dig> complex , three subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase complex , and two subunits of atp synthase   <cit>  . these key components of four of the five complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, combine with other subunits encoded by the nuclear dna genome  <cit>  . in the oxidative phosphorylation, reducing equivalents resulting from the oxidation of nutrients such as glucose, are carried by a series of molecules , which have increasing standard reduction potentials. the resulting free energy is transformed into a proton gradient that is used by atp synthase to produce atp  from adp   <cit> .

although mtdna sequence data have been extensively used in mammalian phylogenetics  <cit> , relatively little attention has been devoted to the study of molecular adaptation of mitochondrial encoded proteins. in this work we combine molecular evolution analyses with crystallographic and secondary structure prediction analyses to explore how mitochondrial genetic variation may be linked to the diverse metabolic patterns of  <dig> mammalian species  from each of the four major clades of the placental mammals. since most of the cell's atp production results from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, we also use estimates of metabolic rates based on oxygen  consumption under aerobic conditions as a surrogate for physiological or metabolic differences among the species in our analyses.

RESULTS
the mitogenomic phylogenetic reconstruction  obtained with bayesian inference methods  <cit>  is mostly congruent with previous comprehensive analyses from nuclear and mtdna genes  <cit>  where mammalian species form four major groups: laurasiatheria, euarchontoglires, xenarthra, and afrotheria. the superordinal tree is resolved with posterior probabilities greater than  <dig> . the relative positioning of the orders is in agreement with that obtained using maximum likelihood , supporting the previous topology.

significant physicochemical amino acid changes among residues in mitochondrial protein coding genes were identified by the algorithm implemented in treesaap  <cit> , which compares the observed distribution of physicochemical changes inferred from a phylogenetic tree with an expected distribution based on the assumption of completely random amino acid replacement expected under the condition of selective neutrality . there are more modifications in the number of radical amino acid property changes in the tips  relative to the interior branches  of the mammalian tree . the interior branches with the highest number of radical amino acid property changes are those that lead to the house mouse and the rat , the branch leading to the elephant shrews , the branch leading to the guinea pig and the greater cane rat , and the branch uniting the humpback whale and white-beaked dolphin . there was an average of  <dig> changes per interior branch. the proteins with the highest average number of changing properties per site are nd and atpase , while cytb and cox were the lowest  . noteworthy, a distinction arises between loop areas and transmembrane domains for all proteins complexes. loop areas are, in general, more affected by positive selection than transmembrane domains .

amino acid properties with signals of strong positive selection accumulated at a rate roughly equivalent to the mutation rate of the gene itself  . this correlation is more pronounced for the protein-coding genes with higher mutation rates, such as atpase and nd, as is most apparent in analyses of the variation along the interior branches, where 20% of the radical amino acid property changes occur . the best correlation between overall mutation rate and number of sites with radical amino acid changes was observed for nds, while the existence of several outliers for atpase slightly reduced the strength of the correlation .

the biochemical complexity of the oxidative phosphorylation processes precludes a clear discussion on the functional implications of the amino acid properties that are under selection . negative selection dominates the categories of radical changes. moderate changes  characterize most of the positive selection detected. properties under positive destabilizing selection  will interfere both at a chemical and structural level. however, since we are considering events as diverse as protein-protein interactions, molecular oxygen and proton diffusion and electron-transfer, it is not possible to establish a direct correlation with the previously referred properties. discussion on varying amino acid properties will therefore be made specifically for those sites which can be mapped on available structural data.

nadh dehydrogenase
the sites with the highest number  of strong positively selected changes in amino acid properties are within nd <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig> . these subunits show a high average in the number of such changes per residue  . nadh dehydrogenase is the first  and the largest enzyme complex in the respiratory chain. it receives electrons from the oxidation of nadh and provides electrons for reduction of quinone to quinol. this is coupled to the translocation of four protons across the inner membrane, generating an electrochemical proton gradient . complex i is an l-shaped complex  that contains all seven mtdna encoded subunits in a membrane-embedded arm. the subunits of the "peripheral arm"  are encoded by the nuclear dna genome. forty-six different units have been identified in complex i from bovine heart mitochondria  <cit> , although the  <dig> bacterial subunits are the minimum needed for sufficient energy transduction by complex i  <cit> . the electron transfer chain events occur in the peripheral arm subunits and the proton pumping occurs in the membrane-embedded module. nd <dig> and nd <dig> have been suggested to be located at the junction between the peripheral and the membrane arm  <cit> , while nd <dig> and nd <dig> should occur at the distal end of the latter  <cit> . nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> are suggested to be the actual proton pumping devices because of their sequence homology with a class of na+/h+ antiporters  <cit> . the overall variation in these subunits, which have already been assigned some function, is larger than the observed variation in the subunits with still unknown functions. mutations in these subunits may interfere with the efficiency of the proton-pumping process. this could either occur through chemical changes that hinder/improve the proton translocation or by disrupting/improving the long-range redox-linked conformational changes that are suggested to occur in order to, for example, activate nd <dig> which is far away from the electron transfer events  <cit> . the number of tm domains predicted in this study  for nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> is similar to that present in their bacterial counterparts   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the sites with higher variation  are located only in the loop regions, suggesting that functional constraints are acting upon the tm domains, which would be consistent with their putative proton-pumping function.

cytochrome b
cytb is an extremely conserved protein, reflecting its fundamental role in energy production in the mitochondria. it catalyses reversible electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c coupled to proton translocation . a quinol molecule at the q <dig> site donates an electron to cytochrome c via the iron-sulfur protein  and cytochrome c <dig> . a second electron passes sequentially through the bl and bh heme ending up in a quinone/semiquinone radical at the qi site. in a complete q cycle, two quinol molecules are the q <dig> site and one molecule of quinol is regenerated while four protons are translocated across the membrane. available x-ray data showing cytochrome bc <dig> inhibitors bound to both qi and q <dig> sites suggest that these mutations have functional consequences. the high degree of conservation among cytb sequences  made it difficult to find evidence of positive selection using treesaap. sites detected by treesaap were mainly located at the interface between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits . however, insight into the evolution of this protein was obtained by inspection of the amino acid substitutions observed in the sequence alignment of the various mammalian species.

the african savanna elephant loxodonta africana has two atypical amino acid replacements at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  that are conserved in other members of the elephantidae family . another uncommon amino acid occurs in most of the elephantidae group at position  <dig>  but not in the american mastodon, suggesting that this mutation originated less than  <dig> million years ago, after the divergence of the american mastodon from the other four proboscidean species analyzed  <cit>  ). at the n-terminal site  <dig>  adjacent to the qi pocket, there is a positively charged residue  that will affect the binding of ligands at this site . residues  <dig> and  <dig> are located in loop ef, which contributes to the formation of the isp binding crater. changes in shape complementarity between the isp and cytb have been shown to be important for the control mechanism of isp conformational change, an important feature of cytochrome bc <dig> mechanism  <cit> . the aspartate on position  <dig>  a conserved asparagine spot , may affect both the interaction with the isp  and other electron transfer events, as it adds an extra negative charge to this interface . also on loop ef, the shift from the conserved proline on site  <dig> to a leucine will alter the rigidity of the secondary structure, with implications in the protein-protein interface contacts .

the cetaceans have an alanine in position  <dig> , which will have a similar consequence to that referred above. the biochemistry involved in aquatic mammals is still a matter of debate, but it has been found that mitochondria of seals can survive ischemia for much longer than terrestrial mammals  <cit> , suggesting changes in function or regulation. the humpback whale has another interesting mutation. an arginine in site  <dig>  changes the local net charge, and being located just outside the coordination sphere of heme bh, such a difference can interfere with the electron transfer events . such alteration is also seen in two of the chiroptera species, the ryukyu flying fox and the new zealand long-tailed bat . curiously, the sloth, one of the mammals showing a lower metabolic rate than expected given its body size  <cit> , has a positively charged residue on site  <dig> , a yet more radical change in net electric charge at this location .

another region that shows radical amino acid variation is helix cd <dig>  close to the hinge region of isp . mutations in the hinge region were shown to have drastic consequences in the catalytic activity of isp, by hindering the conformational changes that are required for cytochrome bc <dig> function  <cit> . two species have a proline residue on site 158: the greater cane rat, a rodent with spiny fur on the back, and the pangolin, the scaly-anteater, which has a low metabolic rate because of the combination of an invertebrate diet and a large body size  <cit> . sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show an elevated number of amino acid changes , suggestive of adaptive relevance in many mammalian species. site  <dig> presents a highly conserved alanine residue. it is placed in the middle of helix f <dig>  within the q <dig> pocket . two peculiar species  with distinct metabolic requirements show very radical amino acid changes at this site. the dugong is an aquatic mammal that is more closely related to elephants than to other marine mammals  <cit> . it is sometimes referred to as a sea cow because of its strict sea-grass diet, combining several interesting features from the metabolic point of view: a large body size, a low energy diet and aquatic environment adaptation. it has an arginine residue in position  <dig>  which will not only cause extra steric hindrance because of the size of the side chain relative to alanine , but will also change the binding mode of the ligand, as it is positively charged. finally, an important change was detected in the alpaca, a domesticated breed of south american camel-like ungulates that lives at an altitude of  <dig> to  <dig> meters above sea-level presenting metabolic adaptations to the low o <dig> environment  <cit> . this species has a proline at site  <dig>  which will drastically alter the local secondary structure, disrupting the alpha helix and therefore changing the shape of the q <dig> pocket. such a mutation is not present in the closest relatives of the alpaca . curiously, the old world members of the camelidae family  have an aspartate in position  <dig>  instead of the asparagine exhibited by the four species that inhabit south america  . several mutations in human cytb have been related to exercise intolerance  <cit>  , all of which have similar chemical effects including a change in the net charge around the heme groups and in the binding pockets and disruption of local secondary structures close to the substrate binding areas.

cytochrome c oxidase
complex iv is the terminal electron transfer chain complex that catalyses the electron oxidations of four consecutive reduced cytochrome c molecules and the concomitant reduction of one o <dig> molecule to water  <cit> . coxi and ii subunits are directly involved in the electron transfer and proton translocation processes, while the other  <dig> subunits are thought to have regulatory roles. results obtained with treesaap were mapped on an available 3d structure for cox . coxi and ii are the most conserved of all the  <dig> subunits analyzed . recent studies on taxa that had clearly experienced significant changes in their metabolic needs detected positive selection acting in coxi and coxii, namely in carnivorous plants  <cit>  and in high-performance fish  <cit> . as demonstrated in high-performance fish coxii subunits, the highly variable sites in mammals are located at the interface between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits , suggesting either an unknown biological role or the occurrence of compensatory mutations in the nuclear subunits . the known functional spots in the complex were found to be very conserved, namely the portion of coxii directly involved in the electron transfer from cytochrome c to the binuclear cua center , the negative patch that surrounds it   <cit> , the metal binding sites, and the proposed proton/o2/water pathways  <cit> . coxiii had more variable sites, which is expected due to the fact that it has no associated redox cofactors. also, coxiii has been shown to be unnecessary in some bacterial organisms  <cit> . some other interesting changes in cox included the k216e mutation  in coxii observed only in cetaceans, and y182h in coxiii only seen in the hippopotamus and the dugong . site  <dig> in coxiii shows a big variation in amino acid type across all species. finally, the mutation m29k in coxii has been shown to cause exercise intolerance in humans .

atp synthase
the proton-gradient that results from h+ pumping into the intermembrane space, is used by atpase to synthesize atp. the proton channel is located in the membrane sector  which is connected to the catalytic component , located on the matrix side of the membrane . the latter, when separated from the membrane, behaves as a soluble atpase. large cooperative conformational changes occur in order to couple the passage of protons through the membrane arm and the production of atp  <cit> . in the proposed mechanism for e. coli atpase, protons that have accumulated in the periplasm enter the assembly via subunit a . one proton binds between two c subunits . in order for the proton to reach the exit channel, the c subunits , that are arranged as a cylinder, have to rotate, releasing the proton after  <dig> steps of proton binding. this rotation movement involves the γ and ε subunits, that remain fixed to the top of one set of c subunits. the rotation of γ within the α/β subunits induces conformational changes that release atp from the alternating catalytic cycles. the ε subunit  is responsible for determining whether complex v acts as a synthase or catalyses the reverse reaction  at the expenses of atp hydrolysis. subunits b and δ  keep the α/β subunits in a fixed position. the conservation of atp <dig> reflects its key role in the coupling of the proton flow with the rotation of the c subunits: as for the nd complex, the sites with higher variation are located only in the predicted loop regions .

the atp <dig> gene encodes a core subunit of the f <dig> component of atpase. in its absence, the atpase in yeast contains no atp <dig> subunit, which suggests an important role in the assembly of f <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, atp <dig> subunit has some highly variable sites , presenting the higher average of radically changing amino acid properties per residue, suggesting some variation of its regulatory role across species.

oxidative phosphorylation vs metabolic rates
some mutations in mitochondrial genes are responsible for severe phenotypic effects related to metabolic capacity, such as exercise intolerance in humans  <cit>  . however, the scaling of metabolic rates in relation to the atp yield through oxidative phosphorylation is not straightforward, as the total metabolic rate is influenced by multiple characteristics varying across species. the scaling of metabolic rates by body size has been discussed for more than a century  <cit>  and remains controversial  <cit> , although generally metabolic rate increases as body mass increases . however, there are numerous exceptions such as for large tropical ant and termite predators , for which basal rate of metabolism decreases when their size increases  <cit> . furthermore, variation in size is accompanied by changes in the metabolic rates inherent to cells . some of the approaches to scale the whole body basal metabolic rate take into account the scaling of individual organ masses and metabolic rates  <cit> . however, variation can occur in the activity of oxidative enzymes, such as in the case of acclimatization to altitude by lamas and alpacas  <cit> .

the variation between the metabolic rates in different species is a consequence of multiple factors, including the need to maintain body temperature, the number of mitochondria and the volume densities and/or cristae surface, and the fact that relative organ mass and organ metabolite rate varies interspecifically. for example, in reptiles, the lower metabolic rates, compared to mammals, are due to a combination of smaller internal organs, lower mitochondrial volume and cristae surface densities  <cit> .

the scaling of metabolic rates is thus an intricate issue, and even recent multiple-cause models  <cit>  are flawed  <cit> . adding to the complexity of interspecies metabolic rates analysis is the random accumulation of variation in the coding sequences of proteins directly involved in energy production and differential selective pressures that arise as mutations affecting mitochondrial atp production.

CONCLUSIONS
we present a mammalian phylogeny based on variation in protein-coding mtdna genes among  <dig> representative species. sequence analyses were complemented with functional analyses to assess the potential importance of mutations leading to radical changes in the physicochemical properties of the amino acids. most of the mtdna protein-coding genes were extremely conserved, reflecting their vital role in oxidative phosphorylation. however, much of the observed variation had plausible adaptive significance.

the nd <dig>  nd <dig>  and nd <dig> complex i genes showed higher than average adaptive variation, with all of the variable sites located in the assessed loop regions of these putative protons pumps .

the available high resolution 3d structure of cytb facilitated interpretation of the functional implications of mutations occurring at portions of the protein which resulted in extreme amino acid properties variation in species with peculiar metabolic requirements . the adaptive variation in cox was restricted mostly to the interface between mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded subunits, suggesting either co-evolution or some influence in the regulatory role of the latter. among the atpase subunits, atp <dig> which has an important role in the assembly of f <dig>  showed the highest amount of adaptive variation in this analysis. atp <dig>  which has an essential role in the atpase rotor performance, showed a high adaptive variation in predicted loop areas. interpretation of possible functional roles of these changes is limited, however, by the lack of experimental and structural data for these genes.

our study provides insight into the adaptive evolution of the mtdna genome in mammals, which may have facilitated the successful radiation and diversification of mammalian species into different environments and habits. the evidence of positive selection acting in important functional regions of the various mammalian mtdna proteins provides the framework for future experimental characterization of the impact of specific mutations in the function, physiology, and interactions of the mtdna encoded proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation.
