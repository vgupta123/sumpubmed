BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis  is one of the leading etiologic agents of non-typhoid fever  <cit> . the disease usually manifests as a self-limiting enteritis, although systemic spread of the infections accompanied by mortalities occurs in young and immunocompromised human patients  <cit> . epidemiological studies suggest that poultry flocks may serve as a major reservoir for se organisms implicated in human clinical cases  <cit> . salmonella enterica silently colonizes the intestinal and reproductive tracts of chickens, which can provide a mechanism for se-contamination of chicken meat, shell-eggs, and hatchery eggs if proper processing and handling are not observed  <cit> . recent investigations have shown that se utilizes its type three secretion systems  encoded by salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig> and - <dig> , respectively, to promote intestinal and reproductive tract colonization  <cit> . the t3ss of salmonellae functions as a needle-like apparatus that injects an array of effector proteins into host cells. the t3ss- <dig> effectors act in concert to modulate host cell cytoskeleton rearrangement, thereby facilitating bacterial entry into host epithelial cells  <cit> . the t3ss- <dig> effectors promote bacterial survival or replication within host phagocytes  <cit> . the t3ss effectors also shape the type of pathological changes associated with salmonella infection via modulating host cytokine and chemokine expressions  <cit> .

it has been commonly accepted that the outcomes of microbial infections, including salmonellosis, are largely determined by the type and magnitude of host systemic and local immune responses. at the mucosal surface, antimicrobial peptides, known as defensins, play a key role in preventing salmonella colonization  <cit> . defensins are cationic cystein-rich peptides that kill microbial pathogens via multiple mechanisms, such as pore formation and membrane disruption  <cit> . based on the arrangement of cystein residues, these peptides are further grouped into three subfamilies, namely α-, β-, and θ-defensins  <cit> . it has been acknowledged that chickens produce only β-defensins, previously known as gallinacins, with  <dig> avian β-defensin  genes being discovered  <cit>  the expression of avbd genes may be influenced by many physiological factors, such as age and breed of the host, as well as the type of tissue or organ tested  <cit> . a recent study suggests that the reproductive tract of laying hens expresses a number of avbds and the expression of several avbds in vagina epithelium is induced by lps treatment  <cit> . although exposure to lps mimics certain aspects of bacterial infection in terms of triggering host immune responses, the later is much more complicated and frequently involves the interaction between bacterial virulence factors and specific host cellular pathways. for example, the t3ss of bordetella brochiseptica inhibits nf-kb activation in bovine airway epithelial cells, resulting in the down-regulation of a β-defensin gene, namely tap  <cit> .

to understand the immunological mechanisms underlying the silent colonization of chicken reproductive tract tissue by se, we determined the expression profiles of avbd <dig> to avbd <dig> in primary oviduct epithelial cells prepared from the isthmus of laying hens. we also determined the changes in avbd expression levels following infections with wild type or t3ss mutant se strains  <cit> .

RESULTS
intracellular bacterial load and se-induced coec apoptosis
our previous data revealed that se strains carrying a mutation in sipa  or pipb  were less invasive than their wild type parent strain, zm <dig>  to achieve similar numbers of intracellular bacteria, coec cultures were initially infected with mutant strains at a higher multiplicity of infection  than that for the wild type se. the data showed that comparable numbers of zm <dig> , zm <dig> , and zm <dig>  entered into coec cultures at  <dig> hour post infection  . although spontaneous apoptosis of coec was minimal within the time frame and the experimental conditions used in this study, se-infections resulted in significant coec death between  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi . however, there was no difference in the degree of apoptosis between coec cultures infected with the wild type strain and that with the mutants .

avbd expression in primary coec cultures
to determine the base-level expression of each avbd gene, rt-pcr assays were performed using total rna extracted from coec cultured for 48– <dig> h. specific amplification of each avbd gene was confirmed by sequencing the corresponding pcr products. electrophoresis of avbd rt-pcr products revealed three general expression patterns with avbd <dig>  avbd <dig>  and avbd9- <dig> being constitutively expressed at relatively high levels ; avbd <dig>  avbd <dig>  avbd13- <dig> at moderate levels ; and avbd <dig> and avbd6- <dig> at minimal levels  . to determine whether the minimal level expressions of avbd <dig>  and avbd6- <dig> resulted from the use of inadequate pcr primers, alternative primers and pcr conditions were used to amplify these genes which yielded similar results . thus the primers listed in table  <dig> were used in subsequent rt-pcr assays.

se-induced changes in avbd expression in coec
quantitative real-time rt-pcr analysis of avbd expression profiles in se-infected coec cultures indicated that se-induced transcriptional changes mostly occurred at  <dig> hpi and to a certain extent, at  <dig> hpi . differential induction of certain avbds by the wild type se and the pipb mutant was also observed at these times. among the constitutively and highly expressed avbd genes, infection of coec with zm <dig>  or zm <dig>  resulted in a temporary repression of avbd <dig>  and avbd9- <dig> , but not avbd <dig> and avbd <dig> . infection of coec with zm <dig>  had reduced or no suppressive effect on the transcription of avbd9- <dig>  compared to infections with strains zm <dig> and zm <dig> . with the moderately expressed genes, infection of coec with zm <dig>  or zm <dig>  had minimal effect  on the expression of avbd <dig> and avbd13- <dig>  whereas zm <dig>  temporarily induced the expressions of these genes at  <dig> hpi . the expression of another moderately expressed gene, namely avbd <dig>  was initially suppressed by zm <dig>  but not zm <dig>  and then induced by all three se strains at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi . with the minimally expressed genes, avbd <dig> and avbd <dig> were induced by all se strains examined. however, the expression levels of avbd <dig> and avbd <dig> in coec infected with zm <dig> were significantly higher than that in coec infected with zm <dig> or zm <dig> . the expression of avbd <dig> and avbd <dig> in coec was minimally affected by exposures to zm <dig> and zm <dig>  compared to the wild type strain and the sipa mutant, zm <dig> also induced elevated expression of avbd <dig> .

verification of pipb-dependent suppression of avbd in se-infected coec
to rule out the possibility that increased avbd expression in coec infected with zm <dig> was caused by the insertion of a chloramphenicol resistance cassette in the chromosome of this strain, coec cultures were infected with zm <dig>  zm <dig>  or zm106-c at the same moi . the number of bacteria that entered into coec and the expression of selected avbd genes were determined at  <dig> hpi. the results showed that zm <dig>  was less invasive than zm <dig>  and introduction of ppipb, a plasmid expressing the pipb gene, to zm <dig>  complemented the invasion defect of this strain . although the number of zm <dig> that entered into coec was less than that of the wild type se, zm <dig> still induced the expression of avbd <dig> and avbd <dig> at levels higher than that induced by zm <dig> . introduction of the cloned pipb gene into zm <dig> weakened the strain's capacity to induce avbd mrna expression . thus, differential induction of avbds by zm <dig> and zm <dig> was indeed associated with their genetic backgrounds, with or without a functional pipb.

discussion
as a key component of innate immune response, defensins are synthesized in many tissues, especially those constantly exposed to microbial pathogens  <cit> . for example, a number of avbd genes are expressed in the vagina of laying hens and the amount of avbd mrna increases following lps treatment  <cit> . although the vagina is anatomically prone to exposure to intestinal or environmental pathogens, the isthmus is likely a critical site in terms of persistent reproductive tract colonization and egg membrane contamination by se  <cit> . in an attempt to understand the innate immune responses against se colonization of chicken oviduct epithelium, we determined the avbd expression profile in primary oviduct epithelial cells. although the preparation of primary chicken oviduct epithelial cells is empirical, the coec cultures used in this study consisted of a high percentage of epithelial cells and spontaneous apoptosis of coec was minimal under the experimental conditions used. because chicken epithelial cell lines are not available at the present time, the primary coec model is a useful tool in studying the early interactions between se and chicken oviduct epithelium. our results showed that avbd <dig>  avbd3- <dig>  and avbd9- <dig> were constitutively expressed at moderate or high levels in the isthmal epithelial cells of laying hens. our data differed from previous findings with regard to the expression of several avbds. first, one report showed that avbd1- <dig> was mainly expressed in bone marrow whereas avbd8- <dig> were restricted in the urogenital tract of young hens  <cit> . second, another study indicated that most avbds, except avbd <dig> and avbd <dig>  were expressed in all segments of oviduct of white leghorn laying hens  <cit> . tissue-specific expression of avbd <dig>  a newly discovered avian β-defensin, has not been previously reported. given that the adequacy of pcr primers and conditions as well as the specificity of rt-pcr products being confirmed in the present study, the discrepancies between our results and others' may reflect the differences between the experimental conditions, such as the breeds of hens  and the sources of rna . it is plausible that the different avbd expression profiles presented by various investigators suggest a complex regulatory mechanism governing the expression of avbd genes in different types of hosts, tissues, or even cells.

avbds play significant roles in host resistance to salmonella colonization as indicated by the correlation between a high level expression of avbd and a low level of salmonella load in the caecum  <cit> . either lps treatment or salmonella infection can induce the expression of certain avbd genes in chicken reproductive tissues  <cit> . in this study, se temporarily modulated the expression of certain avbds in the early stages of infection. increased apoptosis of coec may be partially responsible for the decline in se-induced expression of certain avbds, such as avbd <dig> and avbd <dig>  but it does not explain the diminished suppression of avbd <dig> and avbd9- <dig> by se in the late stage of infection. we therefore hypothesize that se-modulation of avbd transcription involves tightly controlled signaling events that take place during the initial interaction between coec and se. in mammalian hosts, recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern  by toll-like receptors  activates nuclear factor kappa b  and mitogen-activated protein kinase , leading to the up-regulation of beta defensin- <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is likely that lps, flagellin, and/or secreted virulence factors of se function as pamp to trigger the expression of avbds in coec. we also observed that inactivation of pipb, a gene encoding a t3ss translocated protein, increases the ability of se to stimulate avbd expression in coec. the differential induction of avbds by zm <dig> and zm <dig> was only observed when avbds were maximally induced  by the wild type strain at  <dig> hpi and/or  <dig> hpi. the three different facts lead us to believe this phenomenon was apparently not a result of altered coec viability or the presence of a chloramphenicol resistance cassette  in zm <dig> were 1) both the wild type and mutant se strains induced similar degrees of coec apoptosis; 2) zm <dig>  carrying the same chloramphenicol resistance cassette displayed a wild type phenotype in terms of modulating avbd expression; and 3) introduction of the cloned pipb gene into zm <dig> reduced the strain's ability to induce avbd expression. one possible explanation for the elevated induction of avbds by zm <dig>  may be that pipb interferes with one or more steps of the signaling pathway leading to the activation of avbd genes, such as pamp-tlr-nfkb/mapk-avbd promoter. at the present time, the role of pipb in the pathogenesis of salmonellosis is not well understood. limited data indicates that pipb is a chicken host-specific colonization factor of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit> . pipb is targeted to detergent-resistant microdomains of intracellular membranes, which lead to the speculation of a possible interaction between pipb and host cell signaling molecules  <cit> . our recent investigation found that pipb is required by se to invade coec and survive within peripheral blood lymphocyte derived monocytes  <cit> . although the mechanism of action remains to be elucidated, data from the present study reveals a pipb-mediated inhibition of avbd expression in se-infected coec, another strategy used by se to weaken host innate immunity in the oviduct epithelium of laying hens. however, the biological significance of pipb-mediated alterations in avbd expression should be further evaluated using in vivo infection models.

CONCLUSIONS
data from study indicates that the oviduct epithelial cells of laying hens constitutively express most avbds, except avbd <dig> and avbd6- <dig>  at moderate to high levels in comparison to the expression of β-actin. se briefly suppresses the transcription of several constitutively and highly expressed avbds and stimulates the expression of minimally expressed avbds in coec. pipb, a t3ss- <dig> effector protein, plays a role in repressing avbd genes during se invasion of coec.
