BACKGROUND
osmoprotectants figure among the most fundamental solutes in living organisms, being present from bacteria and fungi to higher plants and animals  <cit> . main plant osmoprotectants are chemically composed by amino acids or carbohydrates, but share common features as low molecular weight and nontoxic character even at high concentrations, playing vital roles during abiotic stresses in plants as salinity, drought and chilling  <cit> .

to face such constraints many plants accumulate organic osmolytes, or compatible solutes, in response to the resulting osmotic stress, maintaining cell turgor and therefore the driving gradient for water uptake. they include sugars, mainly fructose and sucrose, sugar alcohols , complex sugars  and charged metabolites   <cit> .

osmolytes can also act as free-radical scavengers or chemical chaperones by directly stabilizing membranes and/or proteins  <cit> . moreover, the accumulation of compatible solutes may also protect plants against damage by scavenging of reactive oxygen species, and by their chaperone-like activities in maintaining protein structures and functions  <cit> . plant cells defend against stresses by modulating their expression according to the type and severity of stress and developmental stage of the plant  <cit> .

most previous works focused on expression assays regarding a single osmoprotectant as in chen et al.  <cit>  or searches in est databases as in barros et al.  <cit>  or even their expression evaluation in transgenic plants  <cit> . no previous appreciation regarding in deep evaluation of transcriptomics databases generated under stress with next generation sequencing  was carried out up to date. in the present work an 'in silico' annotation workflow was carried out integrating high throughput transcriptomics in soybean  plants under water deficit and biotic stress using ht-supersage, as compared with traditional transcriptomics and genome distribution of plant osmoprotectants.

the present approach focused on seven genes related to the biosynthesis of four classes of the most important plant osmoprotectants: proline , trehalose , glycine betaine  and myo-inositol .

proline - comprises a proteinogenic amino acid, essential for primary metabolism in plants during drought and salt stresses, presenting a molecular chaperone role due to its stabilizing action either as a buffer to maintain the ph of the cytosolic redox status of the cell  <cit>  or as antioxidant through its involvement in the scavenging of free highly reactive radicals  <cit>  or still acting as a singlet oxygen quencher  <cit> . in higher plants, proline biosynthesis may proceed either via glutamate, by successive reductions catalyzed by delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase  and delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase  or by ornithine pathway, by ornithine d-aminotransferase , representing generally the first activated osmoprotectant after stress perception  <cit> .

trehalose - in plants this sugar participates mainly in the response to dehydration being first described in the so called resurrection plants myrothamnus flabellifolius  <cit>  and selaginella tamariscina  <cit>  both able to recover after almost complete dehydration. such ability to act in the stabilization of proteins and membranes  <cit> , as well as its role in ros scavenging process  <cit>  are the possible features of its cellular function during non-ideal conditions encountered by plants, where it's synthesis normally occurs by the formation of the trehalose-6-phosphate  from the udp-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate, a reaction catalyzed by the trehalose 6-phosphate synthase . afterwards the t6p is dephosphorylated by the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase  resulting in the formation of free trehalose  <cit> . a transgenic assay using agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer allowed the insertion of the gene tps <dig> from yeast to tomato plants and resulted in higher content of chlorophyll and starch, besides pronounced tolerance to drought, salinity and oxidative stress, despite some pleiotropic changes  <cit> .

glycine betaine  - regards a quaternary ammonium compound  occurring in plants, animals and microorganisms. according to chen and murata  <cit>  gb accumulates in chloroplasts and plastids especially in halotolerant plants, but also in other plants under high salinity, drought and cold stresses  <cit> , with a recognized role associated to antioxidative responses  <cit> . in most organisms gb is synthesized either by the oxidation  of choline or by the n-methylation of glycine. however, the pathway from choline to gb has been the main gb-accumulation pathway in plant species  <cit> . in this pathway choline is converted to betaine aldehyde by choline monooxygenase   <cit> , which is then converted to gb by betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase   <cit> .

myo-inositol - this osmoprotectant is an important cellular component forming the basis of a significant number of lipid signaling molecules involved in diverse pathways, including stress responses. myo-inositol is the most abundant stereoisomer among the nine existing in nature, composed by a cyclohexanehexol, which is a cyclic carbohydrate with six hydroxyl groups, one on each carbon ring  <cit> , acting as substrate in the biosynthesis of many compounds, especially the raffinose family oligosaccharides   <cit>  that accumulate in plants under stress conditions  <cit> . in multicellular eukaryotes, myo-inositol becomes incorporated into phosphatidylinositol phosphate , myo-inositol phosphate , and certain sphingolipid signalling molecules that act in diverse processes, including regulation of gene expression  <cit> . it is synthesized by a two-step pathway, including:  conversion of d-glucose-6-p to d-myo-inositol -monophosphate, 1d-mi-1-p, which is catalyzed by a l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase   <cit> , and  specific dephosphorylation to free myo-inositol by the mg++ dependent l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate phosphatase   <cit> ).

considering the potential of these molecules for plant biotechnological approaches, the present work generated a curated list of osmoprotectants, osmoprotectant-related sequences and important regulatory elements, indicating most adequate tools for their identification and annotation. to evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed approach, the generated seed sequences and the proposed workflow were used to search of osmoprotectant-related sequences in short sequences  generated from ht-supersage  <cit>  deposited in the genosoja  data bank  <cit> . a significant number of tags matched to known osmoprotectant-related sequences showing the effectiveness of the present approach useful for searches in other  databanks comprising second generation sequences associated to the high performance sequencing approaches  regarding genomic and transcriptomic libraries.

the present work also represents the first overall evaluation of the osmoprotectants in a higher plant comparing the prevalence of genes encoding enzymes of osmoprotectants biosynthetic pathways in sequence databanks with different backgrounds considering tissues, stages, stress conditions and also molecular approaches used to generate transcripts . in this aspect soybean offers one of the most abundant data sources for such an evaluation in legumes , due to its importance as a source of food and oil in our planet.

RESULTS
seed sequences and annotation routine
the strategy regarding the use of seed sequences to find relevant literature and posterior mining and curation  was very effective, allowing the identification of  <dig>  seed-sequences  related to the procured osmoprotectants . the sequences were aligned  against the soybean peptide database at phytozome v <dig>   <cit> , also permitting the identification of the respective transcripts from soybean transcriptome used to associate with the transcripts from ht-supersage libraries.

selection of ht-supersage tags for expression evaluation
after exclusion of the singlets,  <dig> , <dig> tags from four libraries were selected for further evaluation, concerning  <dig>  unitags. considering the contrasts between any pair of libraries compared the number of unitags per library ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the numbers of differentially expressed tags  for each compared pair of libraries are presented in the table  <dig>  in all analyzed contrasts, the number of tags differentially expressed overruled the observed amount in the comparison among the controls. the same situation was observed in relation to the ur and dr tags, highlighting the effect of the stress application in the gene activation in both accessions, indicating a richness of analyzable transcripts in the present approach.

ur: upregulated ht-supersage tags ; dr: downregulated tags; n.s.: not significant; ts: drought-tolerant embrapa  <dig> roots under water deficit; tc: drought-tolerant embrapa  <dig> root without stress; ss: drought-sensible br- <dig> roots under water deficit; sc: drought-sensible br- <dig> roots without stress).

identification of osmoprotectant-related genes and differential expression in soybean
the carried approach was very successful, allowing the identification of  <dig> differentially expressed ht-supersage tags associated to  <dig> osmoprotectant-related sequences anchored in  <dig> loci  based on the generated seed sequence bank . many of them regard interesting candidates for a posterior in deep evaluation, as further discussed.

betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 
a total of  <dig> osmoprotectants osmtl sequences presented significant similarity  to g. max sequences from four loci coding badhs and annotated as aldehyde dehydrogenase family 10a . out of four loci, one  was associated with four ht-supersage tags in blastn alignments, tolerating at most a single mismatch . from these, two  were induced after stress in both tolerant and sensible accessions , being mapped in the 3'utrs of all three alternative transcripts of the locus glyma06g <dig> . other two tags  were induced only in the drought sensible accession br- <dig> after stress regarding the same three transcripts, whereas one of them  was mapped in the 3'utr and another in the cds  . the tag gmdr_ <dig> also mapped in the transcript glyma11g <dig>  with a mismatch in the cds region, but no 3'utr was identified for this transcript . despite its induction in the sensible accession in relation to the control, the normalized frequency was only six tmp . thus, the locus glyma06g <dig> emerged as a likely badh candidate gene induced in response to the water deficit stress in the studied libraries.

the members of the aldh  gene superfamily here identified in soybean genome were also categorized by kotchoni et al.  <cit>  that provided a unified nomenclature for the soybean aldh members, including the aldh family  <dig>  also described as putative badh. a previous work  <cit>  also observed the induction of badh  under salinity and its accumulation in response to water stress or drought, indicating a common response of the plant to osmotic changes that affect its water status. the importance of identifying different candidates of this enzyme was highlighted by nakamura et al.  <cit>  that isolated two badh transcripts  from barley, one of them  more similar to previously reported badh genes from dicots. both barley badh genes showed different expression patterns. while bbd <dig> transcript was more abundant in roots and was induced to higher levels under salinity, drought and abscisic acid  treatment, the bbd <dig> transcript was more abundant in leaves after induction by salt, drought, peg and aba treatments, showing the potential of both genes for breeding purposes.

delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase 
polypeptides regarding seven transcripts of delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase  <dig> were similar to  <dig> osmtl sequences . considering the transcripts, only glyma18g <dig>  was not linked to a supersage tag. seven tags matched with transcripts of the remaining six loci. from these, four were differentially expressed in the stressed library as compared with the negative control: one dr  in both tolerant and sensible accessions; two dr tags in the sensible accession , besides a ur tag  only in the tolerant accession  . the fact that both tags were associated to the cds of glyma02g <dig>   may be justified by the absence of the catg sequence in the 3'utr region. even in the absence of expressive induction, the most prevalent tag  was observed in all libraries .

significant upregulation  in leaves of pvp5cs  was demonstrated with transcription increase after 4d drought stress ,  <dig> h post-treatment  of salt stress  and  <dig> h after of cold stress . another p5cs  also from common bean  <cit>  presented predicted amino acid sequence showing  <dig> % identity with pvp5cs and an overall  <dig> % identity with gmp5cs , suggesting pvp5cs <dig> represented a soybean p5cs homolog gene. indels  and snps  were found in the cloned pvp5cs <dig> genome sequence when the authors compared different accessions, helping in the development of a molecular marker in the chromosome b <dig>  the association of molecular markers and phenotypes, in this case pro accumulation is highly applicable for genetic improvement of plants and germplasm screening.

delta-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 
the seed sequences osmtl <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were similar to p5cr polypeptides from two soybean loci , which transcripts were associated to supersage tags . of these one was repressed in the sensible accession  after stress . a second one  was not significantly modulated in the tolerant accession under stress as compared with the respective control, but presented a significant difference when compared to the sensible accession under stress  .

previous genomic analysis indicated that there are only two to three copies of the p5cr gene in the soybean genome  <cit> , similar to the proposed for pea  <cit> . besides, the primary structure of pea p5cr is 85% identical with that of soybean isolated by delauney and verma  <cit> . the mentioned pea p5cr exhibited significant homology to human, yeast, and e. coli p5cr  <cit> , a conservation that favours the here used approach in the search of orthologs using seeds sequences.

the suggestion that p5cr gene is osmoregulated was confirmed after subjecting soybean seedlings to osmotic stress , resulting in an almost six-fold increase in the level of root p5cr mrna  <cit> . an interesting aspect in association with proline overexpression and accumulation regards its influence on the concentration of other amino acids, suggesting a coordinated regulation of distinct metabolic pathways  <cit> . free amino acid levels were compared in wild type and transgenic soybean  transformed with p5cr in sense and antisense directions. the most rapid increase in pro content was found in the sense transformants that exhibited the least water loss, while the slowest elevation of pro levels was detected in the antisense transformants that exhibited the greatest water loss during stress. correspondingly, the level of the pro precursors glu and arg was higher in sense transformants and lower in antisense ones compared to the wild type plants during the initial exposure to stress   <cit> .

myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase 
a total of  <dig> osmtl seed sequences  presented similarities to polypeptides from three soybean myo-inositol sequences. with exception of the transcript glyma08g <dig>  that matched with mips <dig> the other two transcripts, matching mips <dig> and mips <dig>  were associated to tags . the tag gmdr_ <dig>  was the most frequent tag  being dr in both stressed accessions . the other tag  presented a perfect match with the 3'utr of all three alternative transcripts of glyma05g <dig>  with dr expression in the sensible accession under stress . another tag, gmdr_ <dig>  was induced  in the tolerant accession embrapa  <dig> under stress when compared with the respective control . considering all transcripts identified the locus glyma18g <dig>  seems to be the most interesting candidate for future validation and transgenic expression .

the confirmation of such a differential expression regarding mips is useful for plant breeding as highlighted by kaur et al.  <cit>  that observed two divergent genes encoding mips <dig> and mips <dig>  in chickpea with differential expression but discrete overlapping roles, despite their pronounced divergence in respect to their íntrons composition, at the same time retaining 85% identity to their exons. expression analysis showed both genes being expressed in all organs except seed, where only mips <dig> transcript was detected. under environmental stresses , only mips <dig> was induced whereas mips <dig> expression remained the same. also, in those conditions of high temperature and salinity mips <dig> retained higher activity than mips <dig> 

myo-inositol monophosphatase 
a total of  <dig> seed sequences  presented similarities with annotated imp polypeptides regarding  <dig> g. max loci , for those  <dig> supersage tags were identified. from the differentially expressed tags , gmdr_ <dig> mapped at the last catg of the glyma08g <dig> , with bases in the cds and 3'utr and was induced after stress in both accessions. similarly other tags were induced in the tolerant accession under stress  . by the other hand, the tag gmdr_ <dig> was mapped at the 3'utr of three alternative transcripts of glyma04g <dig>  being upregulated in the sensible accession and downregulated in the tolerant accession under stress . also the tag gmdr_ <dig>  was downregulated in the tolerant accession after stress . the abundance and differential expression of various imp candidates in diverse comparisons indicate an important role in soybean water deficit. despite of that and of the known role of these osmoprotectant-related genes, it is interesting that few expression essays or transgenic approaches have been carried using these candidates up to date.

in arabidopsis transformants  <cit> , two imp candidate genes, impl <dig> and impl <dig> were expressed in a similar manner both in the vegetative and reproductive organs. the expression of imp genes in a promoter-gus assay on developing seeds was not coupled with the expression of the genes encoding mipss, which supply the substrate for imps in a 'de novo' synthesis pathway. instead, imp expression was correlated with sal <dig> expression , which is involved in the myo-inositol salvage pathway.

trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 
after blastx  <dig> tps osmtl sequences were associated with  <dig> soybean transcripts of  <dig> loci . from these, tags matched  <dig> transcripts and  <dig> loci, including tps <dig>  tps <dig>  tps <dig> and tps <dig> . among the differentially expressed tags , three  mapped at glyma01g <dig> , glyma06g <dig>  and glyma17g <dig>  respectively and were considered induced in both accessions under stress. in turn, tag gmdr_ <dig>  was induced only in the sensible accession, while tag gmdr_ <dig>  was repressed under stress in the tolerant accession .

other two tags  were also dr in the tolerant accession under stress . these two tags with different expression behavior for the same transcript could be considered as a possible annotation mistake, but further analysis showed that they regard sister tags, differing by a snp, both mapping to glyma01g <dig>  in an upstream site when compared to the mapped gmdr_ <dig> tag. therefore, this last tag could be the result of a partial nlaiii digestion, with the dr expression being questionable and therefore demanding validation. by the other hand, this possibility is quite unlikely, since a double digestion with nlaiii was carried out prior to generation of ht-supersage libraries.

a similar situation was observed for two tags  considered ur in the tolerant accession, while other two ur tags  aligned to the same transcript with a single mismatch . a careful analysis revealed that the tags gmdr_ <dig>  gmdr_ <dig> and gmdr_ <dig> mapped to cds region, while gmdr_ <dig> mapped at the 3'utr, in a catg near the poli-a tail, as expected for most supersage tags . thus, the most valid representative of this transcript seems to be gmdr_ <dig>  induced in the tolerant accession under stress .

additional differentially expressed tags included gmdr_ <dig>  considered ur in the tolerant accession under stress; gmdr_ <dig>  ur in the sensible accession; gmdr_ <dig> , dr in the tolerant accession under stress .

such abundance and induction of tps were also observed in other species. for example rice  contains  <dig> ostps genes, but only ostps <dig> showed tps activity  <cit> . to demonstrate the physiological function of ostps <dig> the authors used the respective gene to transform rice plants and found that ostps <dig> overexpression improved the tolerance of seedling to cold, high salinity and drought conditions without other significant phenotypic changes.

trehalose-phosphatase family protein 
contrasting with the results generated for tps, a single transcript was observed for tpp  in a locus associated to sixteen available osmtl sequences . this transcript was associated to only two differentially expressed tags , both mapped at the 3'utr region , with discrete expression  in two out of four libraries. as in our case, few examples in the literature associated tpp expression with water deficit stress in plants, maybe due to their restricted prevalence in previously analyzed libraries. despite the scarce number of reports the work of ge et al.  <cit>  revealed the transient upregulation of ostpp <dig>  after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid  treatments, with discrete upregulation under cold stress. also, the overexpression lines analysis revealed that ostpp <dig> triggered abiotic stress response genes, suggesting a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by ostpp <dig> 

tag-gene anchoring in the soybean genome
the search for osmoprotectant-associated homologs in soybean genes that matched with supersage tags recovered  <dig> sequences. however, these sequences were anchored in only  <dig> loci in the soybean genome , what indicates the occurrence of alternative splicing of primary transcripts, suggesting an important role of osmoprotectants in vital processes during abiotic stresses in plants, probably inducing specific transcripts for particular environmental conditions. the anchoring of these osmoprotectant-related sequences and their respective supersage tags in the soybean virtual chromosomes revealed that osmoprotectant-related genes are present in  <dig> out of  <dig> soybean chromosomes . most osmoprotectant-related sequences presented syntenic regions among non homologous chromosomes, often forming gene clusters mainly on both arms of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  followed by chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  on the opposite, some chromosomes presented few copies, as in the case of chromosomes 11- <dig> and 19- <dig>  whereas chromosome  <dig> presented no match. the great number of osmoprotectant-related members in the short arm of chromosome  <dig> is also accompanied by a preferential distribution in the subterminal region, a phenomenon also observed in a lesser extent in the chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  less frequently, gene-rich regions were also in the pericentromeric regions  or intercalary regions.

a similar distribution was observed in regard to aquaporin genes, another gene family associated to drought stress in soybean  <cit> . besides redundancies among chromosomes, aquaporins were also prevalent in terminal and subterminal gene clusters. as for aquaporins, the observed redundancy of osmoprotectant-related gene clusters corroborates previous suggestions of the soybean octoploid nature  <cit> .

another previous approach anchoring  <dig> soybean defense genes  in the virtual chromosomes of the legume medicago truncatula revealed  <dig>  sites, most of them clustered in subterminal or terminal positions. the  <dig> sequences were distributed in all nine medicago chromosomes, whereas  <dig> genes presented similarities with distinct segments in the same chromosome or appeared twice in distinct chromosomes  <cit> . similar clustering was described for arabidopsis  <cit> , indicating that such a distribution may occur in regard to different gene families and plant groups.

the redundancies observed probably reflect past duplication events, increasing the number of osmoprotectant-related genes in soybean genome  <cit> . the observed clustering and prevalence in some chromosomes, especially those combining different gene categories  indicate that these regions probably regard qtls  useful for mapping approaches and marker assisted selection.

CONCLUSIONS
high throughput sequencing is generating a huge amount of sequences in given tissues and under contrasting conditions. in the present case we evaluated osmoprotectant-related sequences in 26-bp tags from ht-supersage libraries from soybean coupled with solexa/illumina® sequencing in a digital gene expression profile. the approach permitted tags identification and annotation and their association with sequences from different sources ; identifying  <dig> differentially expressed osmoprotectant-related transcripts relative to  <dig> loci potentially active comprising four osmoprotectants classes. the  <dig>  seed sequences and the workflow are also applicable to evaluate other angiosperms. their clustering observed in soybean may be prevalent in other plant groups  and may be associated to interesting qtls for breeding purposes or still for metabolic engineering in association with drought and salinity and chilling tolerance.
