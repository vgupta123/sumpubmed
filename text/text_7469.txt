BACKGROUND
current views on the control of cell and organ development are anchored on the notion that phenotypes are defined by precise networks of transcriptional activity, acting in a concerted way through a specific combination of transcription factors to specify cell fate  <cit> . a direct test of this general principle is facilitated by precise transcriptome analysis using microarrays or rnaseq  <cit> . this approach in combination with fluorescence activated cell sorting , has allowed the characterisation of transcriptomic profiles of isolated cells from simple organs, such as pollen  <cit> - <cit> , or more complex ones like roots  <cit> , <cit> . the large amounts of information in different databases allow formal analysis of the transcriptional profiles of specific cell types or organs, holding the promise that subsequently these can be distilled into specific transcriptional signatures. at the moment this holy grail of transcriptional regulation is still unattainable, although the majority of these large scale biology approaches end up being extremely useful to the development of smaller scale approaches, focused on a gene or small group of genes  <cit> . there are likely to be multiple reasons for this limitation, including  the limited understanding of additional levels of post-transcriptional/epigenetic regulation that define the final phenotype,  the absence of a proper understanding at a formal/mathematical level of network organization and functioning, or  these transcriptional profiles do not translate into any sort of accessible mechanistic profile, but are an emergent property of the complexity of other underlying levels of organization based on fundamental chemical and physical properties of dna and proteins. there is no easy way to circumvent these limitations at our present understanding of biology, but usable clues could arise from applying an analogue to comparative anatomy at the cellular level, such as searching for conserved transcriptional signatures that could be used for further genetic or physiological dissection  <cit> , <cit> . such an approach can be conceptually rooted into evolutionary developmental biology , in which specific and defined small gene-regulatory networks  may act as defined modules that may have been co-opted during evolution to perform related functions  <cit> . modular grns are intrinsically robust and quasi-independent complexes of genes, allowing the possibility of disentangling evolutionary pathways through comparison with similar modules from unrelated species or organs. this architectural feature of the modules, coupled to their power to generate diversity, makes inter-grn connection elements major targets of adaptive evolution  <cit> . plant-microbe interactions have been recently proposed to constitute an attractive system to test some of these concepts, as the communication module seems to have been both phylogenetically re-deployed and functionally adapted along co-evolution of both plants and microbes  <cit> .

apical growth in filamentous cells is a striking example of conservation of structure and function in plants. as opposed to most plant cells, which grow diffusively over large volumes, these are defined by growing over a relatively small volume at the tip, by exocytosis of specific cell wall precursors  <cit> , <cit> . this form of growth is common among fungi and in some animal cells , and in flowering plants it occurs only in root hairs and pollen tubes. despite differences, growth and morphogenesis is similar in these two cell types  <cit> - <cit>  and as they are functionally skewed towards the same objective: perceive the surrounding environment and process this information to direct growth. previous studies suggested that the molecular and physiological mechanisms employed to direct growth are likely conserved between pollen tubes and root hairs  <cit> , <cit> . this conservation is especially well observed at the level of the cytoskeleton organization, membrane trafficking and endo/exocytosis and signalling pathways mediated by calcium, phosphoinositide, rops and ros  <cit> , <cit> - <cit> . developmental definition by specific transcription factors is well described for root hairs  and pollen grains  <cit> , <cit> . previous transcriptional profiling of pollen and sperm  <cit> , <cit>  allowed the search of conserved grns that exist in the two different cell types that compose the male gametophyte. in comparison, root hairs must be seen in the context of the root, a very complex organ where various hierarchical levels of transcriptional integration are expected  <cit> . while much is known about root transcriptomics in general, the profile of isolated root hairs is still lacking, limiting the possibility of comparative analysis with pollen tubes, and search for conserved transcriptional network motifs. the advent of more powerful and revealing ways of imaging signal integration in roots  makes it even more obvious the need of specific transcriptomics of root hairs, one of the physiologically more important cell types in roots.

here we compare the transcriptional profile of isolated root hairs and pollen with other cell and organ types to test the hypothesis that there are conserved transcriptomic signatures that define functions in similarly growing cells. root hair transcriptomics was previously approached by a number of studies using facs of labelled root cell types and nuclei, respectively  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , by dataset subtraction from root hair development mutants  <cit> , <cit> , or by a combination of mutants and facs  <cit> . here we developed a new way of isolating mrna directly from mechanically purified frozen wild type root hairs. we conclude that root hairs and pollen have highly overlapping transcriptional profiles, with clear similarities at the level of small gtpases, vesicle-mediated transport and various specific metabolic responses, likely defining the unique regulatory processes that occur in these cell types. we propose that this study should constitute the foundation for further genetic and physiological dissection of the mechanisms underlying apical growth of plant cells.

RESULTS
isolation of arabidopsis root hairs
the purity of total rna isolated from root hairs was important for this study, because the slightest contamination would have obscured a potential apical growth signature. therefore, we established a method using an aluminum tower partially immersed in liquid nitrogen and a brush to isolate root hairs from arabidopsis seedlings . to determine the quality of the total rna isolated from root hairs, several genes expressed in specific cell types in roots were investigated by rt-pcr . scarecrow  expressed in cortex, short root  in stele, and plethora <dig>  in stem cells, were amplified from root cdna but not from root hair cdna  <cit> - <cit> , whereas arabidopsis thaliana expansin <dig> , which has been shown to be expressed in root hair cell files  <cit> , was detected both in root and root hair cdna. actin <dig> , expressed throughout the plant including the root hairs  <cit>  was used as a positive control. glabra <dig>  is preferentially expressed in non-hair cells of the root epidermis but is also expressed in low levels in some root hair cells  <cit> , <cit> , and was detected in our root hair sample. moreover, enhancer of try and cpc <dig>  and myb <dig>  both of which are non-hair cell markers  <cit> , <cit> , were called “absent” in our microarray data. together, our data indicated that the extracted rna was rich in root hair specific transcripts.

root hairs and pollen overlap significantly in their transcriptional programs
we obtained the transcriptional profile of the root hairs using affymetrix arabidopsis ath <dig> arrays.  <dig>  genes were detected as expressed, corresponding to 51% of the transcripts represented on the array . the expression profile of root hairs was compared with those of cell sorted hydrated pollen grains , leaves , seedlings , siliques , flowers   <cit>  as well as ovules  and unpollinated pistils   <cit> . in addition, we reanalyzed expression data of single cell types of roots  <cit> , <cit>  resulting in 58% of present calls for stele, 62% for endodermis plus quiescent center, 66% for cortex and 53% for epidermal atrichoblasts. thus, the number of genes expressed in root hairs is significantly higher than in pollen, but smaller than in other vegetative tissues and even in a number of root cell types. it is however similar in root hairs and epidermal atrichoblasts.

when the expression data derived from our data sets is subjected to principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, closely related or overlapping tissues like seedling and leaves, pistils and ovules and siliques and flowers form sub-clusters . interestingly root hairs form a sub-cluster with pollen and not with any of the tissues. principal component analysis shows a similar picture with root hairs and pollen being clearly separated from the other tissues in the first principal component . cell types with apical growth type  are conclusively separated from tissues containing cells only with diffuse growth type  or even a mixture of diffuse and apical growth cell types as found in flowers containing pollen and seedlings containing root hairs. this result statistically shows a relation between the datasets which is suggestive of a common transcriptional profile pattern for the apical growing cells in a plant. importantly, other root cell types  <cit>  do not cluster together with pollen and root hair samples . this is an indication that the separation observed is not solely based on green versus non-green tissue features, although one has to keep in mind that comparison with the root cell type datasets might be confounded by protoplasting and facs effects.  <dig> genes show enriched expression in root hairs in relation to expression levels in leaf, pistil, ovule and silique samples. when compared with “root hair genes” as defined in other studies  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit>  the highest overlap  is achieved with the “core set hair genes” identified by bruex et al.  <cit>  .

analysis of pollen tube and root hair transcriptomes reveals an apical growth signature
we hypothesized that the differences observed in the transcriptional profiles would predominantly derive from transcripts that show enriched or selective expression in root hairs and pollen when compared with tissues containing solely cells with diffuse growth type. of the  <dig> genes expressed in both pollen and root hairs our comparative analysis identified  <dig> genes as showing enriched expression in these apical growing cells . based on comparison with our restricted data set of  <dig> tissues with cell types showing diffuse growth,  <dig> genes are selectively expressed in apical growing cells . however, extending this comparison by including other arabidopsis tissue types and developmental stages  strictly containing only cell types with diffuse growth type, reduces this list of selectively expressed genes to  <dig> . transcriptome analysis of growing pollen tubes of arabidopsis has shown that there is a moderate increase in transcript diversity and abundance when comparing growing pollen tubes with hydrated pollen grains  <cit> . to assess if we are missing potential apical growth signature genes we crossed our list of  <dig> root hair enriched transcripts with the list of genes up-regulated during pollen tube growth  <cit>  and our  <dig> genes common to mature hydrated pollen and root hairs .  <dig> of the  <dig> genes identified as being enriched in root hairs, up-regulated in growing pollen tubes and not in our apical growth list were called absent in our pollen data and would thus potentially have to be added to our list of  <dig> apical growth enriched genes, if not being expressed at higher levels in the sporophytic tissues analyzed. furthermore, in a recent study  <dig> genes were identified as potential polar cell expansion genes by crossing tobacco pollen tube with arabidopsis trichoblast transcriptomic data  <cit> . we found  <dig> of those genes to be expressed in arabidopsis pollen and root hairs, three showing enriched expression and none being selective .

the first column shows the functional classification of the gene . the second column depicts the affymetrix probe set, followed by tair locus  assigned to this probe set and gene annotation in the third and fourth column. in columns five and six the expression values for pollen and root hairs, respectively, are given. the following three columns  depict, if a gene is selectively and /or enriched expressed in root hairs and pollen, followed by the average of the lower confidence bound of the fold change  for apical growing cells. the last two columns give the average fc of pollen and root hairs, respectively.

to validate our microarray results, we performed rt-pcr analysis for eleven of these apical growth selective transcripts. ten were detected in both pollen and root hair samples, while at5g <dig> could not be amplified from our pollen cdna sample , possibly reflecting its low signal value of  <dig> on the pollen arrays. rt-pcr analyses have additionally shown that even if a transcript is called absent on a genechip experiment, it might still be detected by rt-pcr. this holds true for at2g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at1g <dig>  which were detected also in ovules, seedlings and siliques, respectively , although the latter two are likely to be root hair- and pollen-derived, respectively. thus it seems that ten out of eleven apical growth genes are mainly expressed in root hairs and pollen, which is a significantly positive result to allow downstream analyses based on the array data. in addition, comparing detection levels for pollen and root hair samples confirms a significant correlation between microarray data and the semi quantitative rt-pcr performed.

next we asked if genes expressed in both pollen and root hairs are functionally skewed towards biological process classes known or expected to be involved in apical cell growth. our comparative gene ontology analysis showed that genes involved in membrane lipid metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport are over-represented in apical growing cells . in addition energy metabolism, represented by the classes oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial transport and coenzyme metabolism, as well as signal transduction, comprising the classes response to reactive oxygen species, small gtpase signaling and biopolymer modification, are over-represented functions in these cell types. most but not all of these classes are statistically significantly enriched even when the complete set of genes in the root hair and pollen transcriptome, respectively, are analyzed separately .

the mapman tool  <cit>  was used to map differential gene expression in apical versus diffuse growing cell types on the most relevant gene families . this detailed gene family and pathway analysis facilitates the identification of primary targets for reverse genetics confirmation of a possible role for respective gene products in apical cell growth.

promoters of genes that define the apical growth signature share common cis-elements
the identification of conserved cis-regulatory elements is important to understand regulatory networks and combinatorial gene expression. to identify conserved motifs associated with the apical growth gene expression signature, we analysed the promoter regions of apical growth selective genes. in order to overcome recognized limitations of most motif discovery tools available, from which different motifs are obtained after each run, we performed promoter sequence analysis using two different tools, and compared the results based on sequence consensus alignment and annotation to different plant promoter databases. as expected, different motifs were detected by musa  <cit>  and promzea  <cit>  as overrepresented in the promoters of apical growth genes . while we were not able to find correspondence to many of the motifs identified by musa within the publicly available plant promoter database place  <cit> , it was possible to identify the most statistically significant consensus sequences detected by promzea using stamp  <cit> . we found common elements such as the tata box and pyrimidine patch  elements  <cit> - <cit>  that generally appear near the transcriptional start site . this might be the case for the tcttct and ttctct motifs , which probably form part of the higher plant-specific core promoter element y patch. musa was able to detect the agaaa motif, which is a cis-regulatory element of the lat <dig> promoter that is preferentially active in the vegetative cell during pollen maturation  <cit> .

interestingly, the only motif detected by both tools was aaaacaaa, a cis-element that was previously detected in the promoters of genes whose expression is induced anaerobically  <cit> . it is likely that both pollen tube and root hairs growth might sometimes suffer hypoxia, owing to submergence either inside sporophyte tissues or by water flooding, respectively. in fact, an alternative to mitochondrial respiration has been previously characterized in species with bicelullar pollen such as tobacco and petunia  <cit> - <cit> . oxygen availability was never a limiting factor for pollen germination in vitro, while ethanol fermentation either involving alcohol dehydrogenase  and pyruvate carboxylase  pathways were demonstrated to be essential for pollen tube growth and fertilization. taken together, our results suggest that maintaining apical growth mechanisms synchronized with energy yielding might require a combinatorial network of transcriptional regulation.

discussion
cell growth takes place at a restricted area at the cell apex in pollen tubes and root hairs, a process called tip or apical growth  <cit> , <cit> . while many components of the mechanism required for growth of these extremely polarised cells also occur in other cell types that grow by diffuse growth, our analysis of the root hair and pollen transcriptome demonstrates that tip growing cells are defined by a common set of proteins that carry out activities required for tip-growth. we propose that the core set of genes that comprise this apical signature encode proteins that are active in a variety of cellular activities that are required for this mode of cell elongation.

as part of this study we have developed a novel method to isolate growing and mature root hairs directly from seedlings. it circumvents problems associated with methods used in other studies aiming at identifying root hair-rich expression, e.g. by relying on mutants with decreased or increased abundance of root hairs  <cit> - <cit>  or on facs sorted cells or nuclei  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> - <cit> , <cit> . altered transcriptional profiles due to the mutations or due to the extensive manipulations needed before facs in combination with the limitation in purity for the facs approaches might explain the limited overlap of our root hair enriched gene list with comparable lists from these studies. further confounding factors are technical differences like the platforms used  and the tissue types used to identify enriched or selective expression. given these restrictions the 82% overlap with the  <dig> “core set hair genes” identified by bruex et al.  <cit>  is remarkable and validates our approach.

it is long known that the growth in both pollen tubes and root hairs is accompanied by similar physiological processes . probably the best characterised is the formation of a tip-high gradient of cytoplasmic calcium in both cell types and that is required for growth . this local elevation in cytoplasmic calcium concentration is believed to be formed as a result of the activity of channels that transport calcium ions from the outside of the cell to the cytoplasm in the apical region of the cell  <cit> . it is likely that other physiological processes that are specific to tip growing cells exist and remain to be identified. our analysis of the pollen and root hair transcriptome has identified sets of genes that are common to elongating pollen tubes and root hairs and may thus define such a suite of apical growth-specific processes. this increases significantly a previously defined list of  <dig> potential polar cell expansion genes  <cit> . the genes we have identified encode proteins active in a variety of processes, including signalling, cell wall modification, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial transport and coenzyme metabolism. we therefore propose that the apical-growth gene expression signature defines a suite of cellular activities that, like the tip high calcium gradient, are required for the extension of tip growing cells.

among the processes that are defined by the apical transcriptome are genes involved in signalling processes that control growth. gtpases are key regulators of signalling cascades in cells that play important roles in the co-ordination of cellular activities during growth . the rab gtpase homolog h1d  for example is a selectively expressed component of our apical growth signature and has been identified by lan et al.  <cit>  as potential key component of a rho-signaling network in root-hair differentiation. reactive oxygen species play important roles in signaling and cell wall modification during growth of pollen tubes and root hairs and genes that are induced in response to reactive oxygen species are components of the apical-growth signature  <cit> - <cit> ; reviewed in  <cit> . it is likely that they are active in aspects of ros-regulated apical growth in these cell types  <cit> . we propose that these different sets of signalling modules are central components of the apical growth mechanism.

the coordinated expression of genes in pollen tubes and root hairs likely involves a common set of regulatory elements. cis-regulatory elements in the dna sequence surrounding a gene play important roles in the control of gene expression. different cis-regulatory elements are required for the induction of gene expression in different cell types or in response to changes in environmental conditions. for example short whhdtgnnnkcacgwh elements occur in the promoters of genes that are expressed in the root hair of arabidopsis  <cit> . our analysis demonstrates that there are conserved cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of genes that are expressed in pollen tubes and root hairs. we found the aaaacaaa cis-regulatory element that is found in genes whose transcription is induced in anaerobic conditions. this is consistent with the hypothesis that tip growing cells suffer anoxia, an hypothesis long set forth for pollen tubes  <cit> , and known to have specific adaptions in root hairs  <cit> . these conserved cis-regulatory elements are likely required for the expression of genes of the apical signature, but given the divergent results of the two prediction tools experimental validation will be needed.

CONCLUSIONS
together our analyses of the pollen tube and root hair transcriptome indicate that there is a core of  <dig> genes whose expression is higher in these cell types when compared to others in the plant. we propose that the proteins that are encoded by these genes define activities that are common to both cell types. we predict that like the tip-high calcium gradient and the apical production of reactive oxygen species that are required for growth in these cells, these activities will define cellular processes that are required for the growth of tip-growing cells in land plants. given that the tip-high calcium gradient also occurs in other organisms such as fungi , future research will define if the processes regulated by genes of the apical signature are active in other tip growing cells of eukaryotes.
