BACKGROUND
maternally inherited mitochondrial dna  codes for several mitochondrial proteins, primarily components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain . point mutations in mtdna are causes of several diseases, including mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes ; neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa ; and leber's hereditary optic neuropathy . lhon is the most common hereditary optic nerve disease causing severe visual loss. most primary mutations code for proteins in metc complex i, although some secondary mutations are in complex iii  <cit> . a fundamental paradox of diseases caused by mtdna point mutations is that although all mitochondria in the body have the same mutation , the disease is usually expressed in a restricted number of tissues. in the case of lhon, the disease is almost exclusively manifested in retinal ganglion cells , the axons of which make up the optic nerve. the reason for this cell-type specificity is unknown, but presumably is related to a particular susceptibility of rgcs to a consequence of these mutations.

the effect of lhon mutations has been studied by producing transmitochondrial cybrids in human cell lines, demonstrating upregulation of some mtdna transcripts, e.g. aldose reductase  <cit> . lhon cybrids forced to use the metc as their primary energy source by plating on glucose-deficient galactose media, experience apoptotic death and increased cytochrome c release  <cit> . common lhon mutations reduce the rate of respiration in lhon cybrids and oxygen consumption  <cit> . most importantly, lhon cybrids have increased superoxide production compared to wild-type cells  <cit> .

given that metc complexes i and iii are the main sources of basal superoxide production  <cit> , it is possible that aberrant production of superoxide from mutated metc components would cause cell death. but why would abnormalities in superoxide production be a mechanism for the relatively specific effect of lhon mtdna mutations on rgcs? one explanation is the finding that rgcs use superoxide as an intracellular signal for initiating the apoptosis program after apoptosis  <cit> , probably by oxidizing critical sulfhydryls in signaling macromolecules  <cit> . supporting this theory, rgc death is triggered when mitochondrial superoxide levels are increased by knocking down mitochondrial superoxide dismutase   <cit> . given that rgcs use superoxide for intracellular signaling, and that they are specifically affected in a disease of specific mtdna mutations, we examined superoxide production in isolated rgc mitochondria, using the rgc- <dig> rgc cell line. we show that mitochondria derived from rgcs differ from cerebral and neuroblastoma mitochondria with respect to superoxide production in the presence of complex-specific metc substrates and inhibitors. furthermore, we showed distinct patterns of metc component expression. differences in superoxide production between neuronal cell types could prevent aberrant apoptosis signaling  <cit> , and its disturbance with mtdna mutations  <cit>  could account for tissue-specific expression of disease phenotype.

RESULTS
mitochondria can be isolated in bulk from rgc- <dig> cells
because rgcs are post-mitotic and are present in relatively small  numbers, it is impractical to biochemically study rgc mitochondria in bulk. instead, we used the rgc- <dig> cell line, which when differentiated are phenotypically similar to rgcs  <cit> . rgc- <dig> cells were grown in tissue culture and mitochondria isolated. to assess purity of mitochondrial isolation, mitochondrial-enriched and cytosolic fractions were immunoblotted for cytochrome c oxidase, demonstrating significant enrichment . degree of mitochondrial purification was similar among cell-types, based on quantitation with the fluorophore mitotracker green fm, which reacts with mitochondrial free sulfhydryls. mitochondrial samples exhibited similar relative fluorescence values per mg protein .

cerebral and rgc- <dig> cells differ in superoxide production with complex i substrates and after complex i inhibition
superoxide was indirectly measured by detecting h2o <dig> generation over time as a result of spontaneous dismutation of superoxide by mitochondrial sod- <dig>  <cit> . all results are expressed as the mean ± sem  of  <dig> independent experiments, each in duplicate. a typical experiment is depicted in figure  <dig>  the basal level of superoxide production by rgc- <dig> mitochondria in the absence of substrate was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol/min/mg protein, approximately one-seventh that of cerebral mitochondria . mitochondria were then incubated with glutamate  and malate , which yields nadh and serves as a substrate for complex i. in the presence of glutamate/malate there was a small but significant increase in superoxide production in cerebral  and rgc- <dig> mitochondria . when samples were then treated with the complex i inhibitor rotenone  there was an insignificant change in the rate of superoxide production in both cerebral mitochondria  and rgc- <dig> mitochondria  after the addition of rotenone. nonetheless the rates of superoxide production per mg protein in all conditions were significantly lower in rgc- <dig> mitochondria than in cerebral mitochondria .

the rates of superoxide production were determined after the addition of the complex i substrates glutamate  and malate  and the complex i inhibitor rotenone . superoxide was indirectly measured using the h2o <dig> probe amplex red in the presence of horseradish peroxidase . the values are given in nmol h2o2/min/mg protein ± standard error of the mean , with n being the number of independent samples for each mitochondria type.

differentiation of rgc- <dig> cells does not normalize mitochondrial superoxide production
one explanation for the differences in mitochondrial superoxide production between cerebral and rgc- <dig> cells is the fact that rgc- <dig> cells are mitotic, while cerebral neurons are post-mitotic. to address the possibility that differences in proliferative state, metabolic activity, or degree of differentiation affected superoxide production by mitochondria, we differentiated rgc- <dig> cells with the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, which we have previously shown to induce a rgc phenotype without inducing apoptosis  <cit> . we then measured superoxide production rates as above .

basal mitochondrial superoxide production was similar in undifferentiated and differentiated rgc- <dig> cells . mitochondria from undifferentiated and differentiated rgc- <dig> were incubated with glutamate/malate and subsequently treated with rotenone. there was no significant difference between differentiated and undifferentiated rgc- <dig> cells in the production of superoxide after treatment with glutamate/malate  or rotenone . mitochondria from undifferentiated and differentiated rgc- <dig> did not significantly differ in rates of superoxide production when incubated with the complex ii substrate succinate . however, addition of antimycin a resulted in somewhat more superoxide production in differentiated but not undifferentiated rgc- <dig> cells . nonetheless, mitochondria from differentiated rgc- <dig> cells had much lower superoxide production than cerebral mitochondria under all treatment conditions.

rgc- <dig> cells generate significantly less superoxide than neuroblastoma sk-n-as cells with complex i and complex ii substrates
the differences between superoxide generation from rgc- <dig> and cerebral mitochondria could theoretically reflect differences in the source of cells, a cultured cell line in the former and fresh tissue in the latter. to rule out this possibility, we compared superoxide generation in rgc- <dig> mitochondria to another neuronal cell line, the sk-n-as neuroblastoma line . as with cerebral cells, the basal superoxide production was much lower in rgc- <dig> cells compared to neuroblastoma cells . superoxide generation from rgc- <dig> and sk-n-as cells was measured after the addition of glutamate/malate. there was a large increase in superoxide production after the addition of glutamate/malate to sk-n-as mitochondria , similar to what was seen with cerebral and rgc- <dig> mitochondria. after the addition of rotenone there was a significant decrease in superoxide production in sk-n-as cells , unlike what was seen with cerebral or rgc- <dig> cells. in experiments where the complex ii substrate was added to neuroblastoma mitochondria, there was a minimal change in production of superoxide , similar to cerebral and rgc- <dig> mitochondria. the addition of antimycin a to neuroblastoma mitochondria resulted in a small but significant decrease in superoxide production , similar to rgc- <dig> mitochondria but different from the increase in superoxide seen in cerebral mitochondria. in all cases, the rates of superoxide production by neuroblastoma mitochondria were much higher than rgc- <dig> mitochondria.

mitochondria isolated from rgc- <dig>  neuroblastoma sk-n-as, and cerebrum differ in content of metc components
most mitochondrial superoxide is produced by the metc. to determine if differences in superoxide production among mitochondria from different neuronal subtypes could be caused by differences in the metc, we measured the relative amounts of metc complexes for protein concentration-corrected mitochondrial isolates. immunoblots against specific metc complex subunits were scanned by densitometry and normalized to concentrations from cerebral mitochondria . the most surprising finding was that rgc- <dig> mitochondria contained only one-sixteenth as much metc complex i as was present in cerebral cells. complex ii, iii, and iv components were expressed at a molar concentration in rgc- <dig> mitochondria about half that of cerebral mitochondria. neuroblastoma mitochondria had similar levels of complexes i-iv, ranging from 16% to 46% that of brain.

the band density of mitochondrial related proteins were compared between cerebral, neuroblastoma, and rgc- <dig> derived mitochondrial samples for metc complexes i-iv. a comparison of vdac and pmp <dig> expression were used to determine the presence of non-metc mitochondrial components and peroxisomal contamination, respectively. cerebral, rgc- <dig>  and neuroblastoma values are given as ratios compared to the band density of cerebral mitochondria.

we considered the possibility that different physical properties of cells or mitochondria might produce differential purification of mitochondria. the primary organelles co-purified with mitochondria are peroxisomes. to investigate the possibility that peroxisomal contamination could decrease the number of mitochondria with the preparations, we immunoblotted protein-corrected mitochondrial isolates for the peroxisomal protein pmp <dig>  there were similar amounts of pmp <dig> in the mitochondria purified from rgc- <dig> cells, neuroblastoma cells, and cerebral cells , ruling out differential peroxisomal contamination as the cause of lower metc components in rgc- <dig> cells. we then compared mitochondrial isolates from the different cell types for a non-metc mitochondrial protein, the voltage-dependent anion channel . there was a small decrease in vdac expression in mitochondria isolated from rgc- <dig> cells in comparison to cerebral and neuroblastoma cells, but not enough to explain the significant difference in complex i expression.

we used real-time rt-pcr to compare mrna levels of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes i, ii, iii, iv, v, sod- <dig>  pmp- <dig>  and vdac to see if cell type-specific gene transcription levels correlated with protein levels. when normalized to vdac expression, all metc subunits were downregulated in both undifferentiated and differentiated rgc- <dig> cells . in general, differences in mrna levels between cell-types correlated with differences in protein levels. surprisingly, complex i  transcription levels were higher in brain than rgc- <dig> cells, but this difference was not seen to the same degree in protein levels, measured by immunoblotting. on the other hand, complex iv  transcription levels were much lower than the difference in protein levels would predict . differentiation of rgc- <dig> cells had a minimal effect on transcription levels of all genes studied.

changes in transcription levels of each gene studied are given in terms of the difference in threshold cycle compared to cerebral cells, the difference in threshold cycle relative to that of vdac ), and the relative expression level, given as a percent of cerebral and normalized to vdac expression.

discussion
mitochondria isolated from the rgc-like rgc- <dig> cell line produce significantly less superoxide than cerebral and neuroblastoma mitochondria when incubated with complex i or ii substrates or when treated with complex i or iii inhibitors. correspondingly, rgc- <dig> mitochondria contain significantly lower levels of complex i compared to other metc components, despite similar levels of transcription. together, these findings imply that neuronal mitochondria behave differently depending on the cell of origin.

overall, the rate of superoxide production of rgc- <dig> cell mitochondria was much less than that of cerebral mitochondria for a given amount of mitochondrial protein. comparing the rates of production in the absence of substrates and inhibitors, basal cerebral mitochondria superoxide production was seven times of that of rgc- <dig> cells. the most notable differences after metc inhibition was the increased superoxide production in cerebral mitochondria in the presence of the complex iii inhibitor antimycin a. after treatment with antimycin a, cerebral mitochondria had a more than 2-fold increase in superoxide production, compared to an insignificant decrease in superoxide production rate in rgc- <dig> mitochondria.

the difference in superoxide production is not a result of rgc- <dig> cells being undifferentiated mitotically active cells. we previously showed that low-dose staurosporine, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, can induce rgc- <dig> cells to differentiate to a phenotype that is similar to a mature rgc  <cit> . to see if differentiation affected ros production, we compared superoxide production in differentiated and undifferentiated rgc- <dig> cells. differentiated and undifferentiated rgc- <dig> produced similar amounts of superoxide in the presence of complex i substrates and inhibitors and only differed slightly in superoxide production after incubation with succinate, a complex ii substrate, in the presence of the complex iii inhibitor antimycin a. differences in superoxide production between mitochondria from rgc- <dig> cells and cerebral cells were also not due to differences in the source of the tissue , because similar differences were seen when rgc- <dig> cells were compared to a neuroblastoma cell line. finally, the differences were also not a result of differential purification of mitochondria, as the levels of the peroxisomal-associated protein pmp <dig> were similar across cell-type.

there are limitations to our study. we did not measure superoxide directly, instead indirectly measuring superoxide generation using the h2o <dig> probe amplex red. indirect superoxide measurement with a probe specific for h2o <dig> is commonly performed  <cit>  because mitochondrial superoxide dismutase  converts superoxide to h2o <dig>  and the latter freely crosses organelle and cell membranes. amplex red reacts with h2o <dig> in the presence of hrp and is converted to the fluorescent product resorufin. in these experiments we detected changes in the levels of resorufin and used them to determine the production rates of superoxide. the production of hydrogen peroxide by complex i does not necessarily require dismutation  <cit> . suggesting that measuring levels of h2o <dig> is an acceptable method for measuring superoxide production or leakage from complex i. nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that abnormally low sod- <dig> activity biased our results.

we also examined superoxide production in mitochondria obtained from the rgc- <dig> cell line, and not from freshly isolated rgcs. it is possible that some of the differences that we measured in superoxide generation arose because the cerebral mitochondria were isolated from whole cerebral tissue and the rgc- <dig> mitochondria were isolated from a clonal cell line. the environment of the rgc- <dig> is normoxic, being exposed to atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen, compared to the relatively hypoxic environment within the brain. also, cerebral mitochondria were isolated from a mixture of cell types, not only neuronal, but also glial cells, and this could blur differences between the cerebral and rgc- <dig> mitochondria. purifying a usable quantity of mitochondria from freshly isolated rgcs is impractical, and thus the use of a differentiable rgc cell line allows otherwise unfeasible mitochondrial studies. difficulties in isolation of mitochondria from rgcs include the large numbers of animals necessary to obtain enough rgcs  and subsequently obtaining mitochondria from a small number of purified rgcs. it is impractical to do mitochondrial metabolic experiments from freshly isolated rgcs, as discussed above, and whole retina cannot be used because rgcs make up only a small fraction of the tissue.

low levels of superoxide production in rgcs compared to cerebral and neuroblastoma cells could be due to decreased flow of oxygen through the metc, decreased leakage of superoxide from the metc, or increased scavenging via non-sod mechanisms . our experimental design could not distinguish these possibilities. the explanation is not simply one of lower metc density in rgcs. immunoblotting demonstrated that there was markedly less mitochondrial complex i in rgc- <dig> cells compared to cerebral and neuroblastoma cells, while levels of complexes ii, iii, and iv were similar. analysis of transcription levels confirms lowered gene expression of these complexes in rgc- <dig> cells compared to cerebral cells. if there were also lower amounts of other metc components in rgc- <dig> cells, then this could explain why rgc- <dig> mitochondria produce less superoxide. however, if the differences in superoxide were simply a matter of lower concentration of metc components, then this could explain differences in baseline superoxide production, but would not explain differences in patterns of superoxide induction, e.g. why there was such a large increase in superoxide production in cerebral mitochondria but not rgc- <dig> cells after treatment with antimycin a. it has been shown that superoxide production by isolated succinate dehydrogenase is highly dependent on succinate concentration, with superoxide generation increasing, then decreasing with succinate concentration  <cit> . lower expression of succinate dehydrogenase and other metc components, as suggested by our immunoblotting and rt-pcr data, may lead to succinate blocking autooxidation at a lower concentration in rgc- <dig> cells compared to cerebral cells. another possibility relates to the fact that antimycin a leads to increased superoxide production by backflow of electrons into complex i. if complex i levels are lower in rgc- <dig> cells, then this would lead to less superoxide production after antimycin a treatment in those cells.

we speculate that decreased production of superoxide by rgcs may have a physiological rationale. we previously demonstrated rgcs use superoxide as a mitochondrial-derived intracellular messenger for signaling the initiation of apoptosis after axonal injury  <cit> . if rgcs use superoxide to signal cell death, then it is reasonable to presume that they also tightly regulate its intracellular concentration in relevant compartments. otherwise there would be death of a critical  class of neurons.

loss of this tight regulation of superoxide production could also explain the mechanism of rgc death from mtdna mutations in lhon. although it is commonly believed that lhon results from rgcs having high-energy requirements, with mtdna mutations causing rgc-specific death because the cell cannot meet its energy demands. however, this theory does not clearly address why there is little neuronal loss in other high-energy cells such as photoreceptors or cardiac muscle , nor does it explain the delayed onset of lhon. most importantly, there is a discrepancy between the degree of atp deficiency and the severity of the optic neuropathy in cells with lhon mutations  <cit> .

instead, it is more likely that differences in ros production and sensitivity to oxidative stress among cells types explains the timing and the specificity of lhon. there are precedents for cell type-specific differences in mitochondrial superoxide production. rat brain and liver mitochondria differ in superoxide production in the presence of metc substrates and inhibitors  <cit> . cardiac mitochondria from birds and mice have dramatically different rates and sites of h2o <dig> production  <cit> . finally, lhon cybrids in neuronal-like differentiated nt <dig> cells have greatly increased superoxide production  <cit> . it makes sense that ros would be involved in lhon because the mutations are in known superoxide production sites  <cit> , inhibition of these sites dramatically increases superoxide synthesis  <cit> , and neuronal cybrids with lhon mutations have increased superoxide production  <cit> . in cerebral mitochondria, complex i produces the majority of superoxide radicals  <cit> , and the same may be true for rgcs  <cit> . if rgc mitochondria have insufficient mechanisms for reducing levels of superoxide production, particularly in response to metc inhibition, then mutations of critical complex i components could theoretically lead to catastrophic superoxide production and anomalous signaling of cell death in the absence of axonal damage  <cit> . lower metc component expression and basal superoxide production in rgcs may be accompanied by a similar downregulation in sod <dig> or other ros-reducing systems, leading to a phenotype which is overwhelmed more readily than other cells in the event of aberrant superoxide generation.

CONCLUSIONS
mitochondria from a rgc-like cell line produced superoxide at a much lower rate than cerebral or neuroblastoma mitochondria, and there was a dramatic difference in superoxide production when electrons were shunted to complex i using metc complex i and iii substrates and inhibitors. these differences were mirrored by different patterns of metc component expression between cell types. decreased superoxide production may be essential for preventing aberrant signaling of cell death in rgcs. mutations coding for specific components of nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase in lhon may disrupt the cell type-specific handling of superoxide in rgc mitochondria and lead to premature cell death. this could explain why lhon mtdna mutations are present in all cells, but the clinical phenotype is predominantly one of rgc death.
