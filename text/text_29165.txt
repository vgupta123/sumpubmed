BACKGROUND
chronic rhinosinusitis  is a group of heterogeneous inflammatory disorders of nose and the paranasal sinuses. based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps, crs is classified into crs with nasal polyps  and crs without nasal polyps   <cit> . eosinophilic inflammation has been considered to be a cardinal feature of crswnp in whites for a long time. however, in asians, only half of crswnp present eosinophilic inflammation, indicating a more heterogeneous feature of crswnp in asians  <cit> . although the etiology of crs remains enigmatic, all phenotypic crs are characterized by prolonged and persistent inflammation in the lesional sinonasal mucosa  <cit> . therefore, the anti-inflammatory treatment is currently considered as a primary treatment for crs  <cit> .

glucocorticoids have been widely used to control crs given their powerful and broad anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> . glucocorticoids can suppress the chemotaxis and activation of various immune cells including eosinophils, t cells, and mast cells, etc.  <cit> . they can induce apoptosis of eosinophils and suppress the release of an array of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and mediators from resident and inflammatory cells in tissues  <cit> . beyond the well-known antimicrobial effect, increasing evidences have emerged to show that macrolides have intrinsic anti-inflammation and immunomodulation properties  <cit> . macrolides can block the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor κb and inhibit the production of various inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin - <dig> and tumor necrosis factor-α   <cit> . they can also suppress the secretion of airway mucus, induce the apoptosis of neutrophils, and even diminish the formation of bacterial biofilms  <cit> . some studies have demonstrated the in vivo effect of long-time, low-dose macrolide treatment on controlling crs .

although glucocorticoids and macrolides have been recommended for the treatment of crs by european position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps  <cit> , there are a number of crs patients that do not response well to glucocorticoid treatment and conflicting results exist regarding the efficacy of macrolide treatment in crs  <cit> . the reasons for the variations of efficacy of glucocorticoids and macrolides are unclear, but part of the problem is heterogeneity of crs, with several different pathways contributing to disease in different patients. in whites, crssnp presents a predominant t helper   <dig> milieu, whereas crswnp is characterized by a th2-skewed eosinophilic inflammation  <cit> . nevertheless, in chinese, only eosinophilic, but not non-eosinophilic, crswnp demonstrates a th2-dominated inflammation  <cit> . in addition, th <dig> responses that are almost absent in white patients with crs have been found up-regulated in chinese . our recent study has shown that although oral prednisone is able to suppress the th2-dominated eosinophilic inflammation, it cannot inhibit the th <dig> responses and associated neutrophilic inflammation in chinese patients with crswnp  <cit> . wallwork et al. have found that macrolides may only be efficient for crssnp patients without elevated serum ige levels  <cit> . we have found that long-term clarithromycin treatment could inhibit il- <dig> and myeloperoxidase production in chinese patients with crssnp and clarithromycin was more effective for crssnp patients with high levels of il- <dig>  <cit> . these studies suggest that the phenotype of crs might be a potential determining factor of the efficacy of anti-inflammation agents, and glucocorticoids and macrolides might prefer to control eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, respectively. however, the effects of glucocorticoids and macrolides on the inflammatory responses in distinct phenotypic crs have not been carefully and comprehensively compared. hence, in this study we compared the effects of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on different inflammatory pathways in sinonasal mucosa from chinese patients with crssnp, and eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic crswnp by using an ex vivo tissue explant culture model.

RESULTS
the pilot study of dose response effect of clarithromycin and dexamethasone
in the pilot experiments, we found a concentration-dependent effect of clarithromycin and dexamethasone on the reduction of il- <dig>  and induction of il- <dig> and clara cell 10-kd protein  production in sinonasal mucosa from crssnp, and eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic crswnp with a maximal response at a concentration of 10−5 mol/l  . in contrast, we found that compared with controls, dexamethasone and clarithromycin at serial concentrations of 10−7 mol/l, 10−6 mol/l, and 10−5 mol/l did not have significant influence on tissue cell viability after 24-h culture, and viability of tissue cells from all crs groups was >91 % in all experiment conditions . in order to confirm the specific effect of dexamethasone at a relatively high concentration of 10−5 mol/l, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, mifepristone, was added to the culture. we discovered that mifepristone could diminish the effect of 10−5 mol/l of dexamethasone on il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and cc <dig> production in sinonasal mucosa from all three crs groups, confirming the specific effect of dexamethasone .fig.  <dig> the concentration-dependent effect of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on the production of interleukin - <dig>  il- <dig> and clara cell 10-kd protein . both of dexamethasone and clarithromycin demonstrated a significant concentration-dependent effect on the protein production of  il- <dig> and  il- <dig> and  mrna production of cc <dig> from sinonasal mucosa from different phenotypic chronic rhinosinusitis after 24-h culture . maximal effect was seen at a concentration of 10−5 mol/l. an equivalent volume of methanol solution was used as control for dexamethasone and clarithromycin. crssnp, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps; non-eos crswnp, non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; eos crswnp, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; cla, clarithromycin; dex, dexamethasone. n =  <dig> for crssnp, and eos and non-eos crswnp group

the effects of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on epithelial-derived mediators
our pilot experiments showed that 10−5 mol/l of dexamethasone and clarithromycin had maximal pharmaceutical effect without affecting the tissue cell viability. in addition, this concentration was reported comparable to that seen in serum during oral administration of clarithromycin, and was close to local concentration when glucocorticoids are delivered intranasally, respectively  <cit> . thus, we have chosen 10−5 mol/l as the concentration for the following comparison experiment. we found that dexamethasone and clarithromycin could similarly up-regulate the mrna expression of cc <dig> , whereas down-regulate the mrna expression of il- <dig> , il- <dig> , osteopontin  and thymic stromal lymphopoietin  , in sinonasal mucosa from crssnp, and eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic crswnp patients.fig.  <dig> the effect of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on the expression of epithelial-derived mediators. the mrna relative expression of  clara cell 10-kd protein ,  interleukin - <dig>   il- <dig>   osteopontin, and  thymic stromal lymphopoietin  in the sinonasal mucosa from different phenotypic chronic rhinosinusitis after 24-h culture with 10−5 mol/l of dexamethasone or clarithromycin. an equivalent volume of methanol solution was used as control for dexamethasone and clarithromycin. crssnp, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps; non-eos crswnp, non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; eos crswnp, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; cla, clarithromycin; con, control; dex, dexamethasone. n =  <dig> for crssnp group; n =  <dig> for eos and non-eos crswnp group. *p <  <dig>

the effect of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on dc relevant markers
dexamethasone and clarithromycin could comparably down-regulate the mrna expression of cd <dig>  and ox <dig> ligand   in sinonasal mucosa from crssnp and eosinophilic crswnp patients, whereas no statistically significant effect was observed for sinonasal mucosa from non-eosinophilic crswnp patients. both dexamethasone and clarithromycin could down-regulate the mrna expression of cd <dig> , inducible costimulator ligand   and programmed cell death ligand  <dig>   in sinonasal mucosa from all three crs groups in similar extent.fig.  <dig> the effect of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on the expression of dendritic cell relevant markers. the mrna expression of  cd <dig>   cd <dig>   inducible costimulator ligand ,  ox <dig> ligand , and  programmed cell death ligand  <dig>  in sinonasal mucosa from different phenotypic chronic rhinosinusitis after 24-h culture with 10−5 mol/l of dexamethasone or clarithromycin. an equivalent volume of methanol solution was used as control for dexamethasone and clarithromycin. crssnp, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps; non-eos crswnp, non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; eos crswnp, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; cla, clarithromycin; con, control; dex, dexamethasone. n =  <dig> for crssnp group; n =  <dig> for eos and non-eos crswnp group. *p <  <dig> 



the effect of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on th cytokines
after treatment with dexamethasone or clarithromycin, we detected a remarkable and similar decrease of interferon -γ protein production  from sinonasal mucosa from all crs groups and il- <dig> protein production  from sinonasal mucosa from crssnp and eosinophilic crswnp. clarithromycin also suppressed il- <dig> production  from sinonasal mucosa from non-eosinophilic crswnp. dexamethasone and clarithromycin could significantly inhibit the protein production of il- <dig>  and il- <dig>  in only eosinophilic polyp tissues, possibly due to the very low expression levels of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in crssnp and non-eosinophilic crswnp. in contrast, neither dexamethasone nor clarithromycin had significant effect on il-17a  protein production in crs. in addition, both dexamethasone and clarithromycin inhibited the mrna expression of eosinophilic cationic protein   in sinonasal mucosa from crssnp and eosinophilic crswnp, but not in those from non-eosinophilic crswnp. on the contrary, we observed a significantly and comparably up-regulated production of il- <dig>  protein from sinonasal mucosa from all crs groups after dexamethasone or clarithromycin treatment.fig.  <dig> the effect of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on production or expression of th cytokines. the mrna relative expression levels of  eosinophilic cationic protein  in sinonasal mucosa, and the protein levels of  interferon -γ,  interleukin - <dig>   il- <dig>   il- <dig>   il- <dig>  and  il-17a in culture supernatants, from different phenotypic chronic rhinosinusitis after 24-h culture with 10−5 mol/l of dexamethasone or clarithromycin. an equivalent volume of methanol solution was used as control for dexamethasone and clarithromycin. crssnp, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps; non-eos crswnp, non-eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; eos crswnp, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; cla, clarithromycin; con, control; dex, dexamethasone. n =  <dig> for crssnp group; n =  <dig> for eos and non-eos crswnp group. *p <  <dig>

discussion
development of phenotype-orientated therapeutic strategies is critical for the improvement of crs treatment. whether glucocorticoids and macrolides are more effective for specific phenotypic crs has not been completely understood. in this study, we have comprehensively compared the efficacy of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on the expression and/or production of epithelial-derived mediators, anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, dc relevant markers, th1/th2/th <dig> cytokines, prrs, and tissue remodeling factors in chinese crssnp, and eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic crswnp by using a tissue explant culture model. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to carefully compare the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids and macrolides in the different phenotypic crs. overall, we are surprised to find that dexamethasone and clarithromycin exerted similar anti-inflammation effects on different inflammatory pathways in crs and most of their effects did not vary by the phenotypes of crs in this tissue explant study.

cc <dig> and il- <dig> are two important anti-inflammatory molecules in airways. our previous studies have shown that cc <dig> and il- <dig> production in sinonasal mucosa can be induced by glucocorticoids  <cit> . in this study, we not only confirmed effect of dexamethasone which validated our present experimental system, but also demonstrated a similar effect of clarithromycin on cc <dig> and il- <dig> induction in all phenotypic crs, suggesting both agents may exert their anti-inflammatory function through promoting the production of anti-inflammatory mediators.

“epithelium-dc-th cell” cross-talk and chemokines play a key role in the formation of polarized th response and biased granulocyte activation in sinonasal mucosa. epithelial-derived tslp, il- <dig> and il- <dig> are critical in licensing innate and adaptive immunity and promote th <dig> responses  <cit> . our recent study has shown that cd86+ activated myeloid and plasmacytoid dcs were increased in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic crswnp  <cit> . the ox40l/pd-l1+ lesional dcs likely under the influence of tslp in eosinophilic crswnp can prime th <dig> cells, whereas the low ox40l/pd-l1-expressing lesional dcs with a possible influence by osteopontin in non-eosinophilic crswnp primarily induce th1/th <dig> cells  <cit> . in this study, surprisingly, we found that not only dexamethasone but also clarithromycin was able to suppress the expression of tslp, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  ox40l, and pd-l <dig>  moreover, the expression of th <dig> cell and eosinophil chemokines, including ccl17/tarc, ccl22/mdc, ccl11/eotaxin and ccl5/rantes, was also inhibited by both dexamethasone and clarithromycin. these changes were coinciding with the down-regulation of th <dig> cytokines  and ecp by both dexamethasone and clarithromycin in eosinophilic polyp, indicating that beyond its well-known suppression on neutrophilic inflammation  <cit> , macrolides may also possess an inhibitory effect on the th2-dominated eosinophilic inflammation as glucocorticoids. in fact, there are few previous reports showing that macrolides treatment can reduce the ecp levels in nasal secretion from crs patients  <cit> .

on the other hand, clarithromycin and dexamethasone also demonstrated comparable action on ameliorating neutrophilic inflammation through diminishing the expression of neutrophil chemokines  in crs. moreover, both clarithromycin and dexamethasone suppressed th <dig> responses by decreasing the expression of th <dig> cell chemokines  and th <dig> cytokines , but had no effect on il-17a production, in all phenotypic crs. consistently, our previous in vivo study has showed that oral prednisone treatment could not suppress th <dig> response in chinese crswnp  <cit> . thus, these studies arouse the need to seeking novel therapies targeting th <dig> responses in crs.

pro-inflammatory cytokines act as intercellular signals to regulate the functions of dcs and other immune cells. in this study, we found that gm-csf, il- <dig>  tnf-α and il-1β production could be diminished by dexamethasone and clarithromycin, which is consistent with previous reports and in line with their inhibitory effect on nf-κb signaling pathway  <cit> .

previously, zhang et al. have elegantly demonstrated that although glucocorticoids could inhibit acute phase response in airway epithelial cells, it may spare or enhance the expression of local innate host defense molecules, such as complements, collectins, and other antimicrobial proteins  <cit> . in addition, homma et al. have found that dexamethasone synergistically increased tlr <dig> expression in respiratory epithelial cells in combination with tnf-α and ifn-γ  <cit> . prrs are crucial in recognizing a wide range of microbial pathogens and triggering signaling cascades that activate effective immune responses. in line with zhang’s and homma’s reports  <cit> , interestingly, we found herein that although glucocorticoids and macrolides were able to diminish the expression of an array of inflammatory molecules, they did increase the expression of tlrs and mda- <dig> in sinonasal mucosa from crs. these data suggest that glucocorticoids and macrolides may reinforce the local innate host defense against infectious organisms in airways and therefore reduce the exacerbation of crs.

besides the persistent inflammation, the sinonasal mucosa of crs patients is also characterized by marked tissue remodeling  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated distinct remodeling features of different phenotypic crs in chinese  <cit> . eosinophilic crswnp shows marked edema; on the contrary, crssnp presents significant fibrosis  <cit> . this remodeling process may be controlled by growth factor-induced extracellular matrix deposition and proteases-dominated degradation . extending previous findings on dexamethasone , we found herein that both dexamethasone and clarithromycin might suppress the remodeling process in crs through suppressing the expression of remodeling relevant mediators.

we have to acknowledge several limitations of our current study that ask us to explain our results with caution. the most important one is that although we used tissue explant culture to simulate in vivo condition as closely as possible, whether these two agents can exert same efficacy in vivo needs further study. secondly, we treated tissue samples for 24-h that is significant different from the time period of treatment we used in clinic. thirdly, we did not do the dose–response experiments for all studied parameters given the limited amount of tissue samples. moreover, it should be noted that our current study is a small sample size study and further confirmation with a larger population is needed. fourthly, although the concentration of 10−5 mol/l we used in tissue explant culture is close to the concentration achievable in patients and both drugs at this concentration did not reduce the tissue cell viability, we still need to explain our data with caution since this concentration, especially for dexamethasone, is much higher than that commonly used in cell culture study. fifthly, for some molecules, we only measured the mrna expression levels because of the limited amount of tissue samples, therefore the changes of these molecules at protein level wait to be confirmed in future. sixthly, although we found the changes of the expression and/or production of these molecules in crs, the intracellular and intercellular mechanisms underlying the actions of dexamethasone and clarithromycin remain to be defined in future.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our ex vivo results likely reflect the similar efficacy of glucocorticoids and macrolides to regulate different patterns of inflammation response, innate immunity, and tissue remodeling in crs and their effects did not vary by the phenotypes of crs. our results provide the possibility of using dexamethasone and clarithromycin to reduce the exacerbation of crs and employing clarithromycin to treat eosinophilic inflammation in crs as a steroid sparing drug. at same time, our study arouses the need to develop novel therapies targeting th <dig> responses in crs. however, obviously, further in vivo studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of dexamethasone and clarithromycin on the treatment of different phenotypic crs. moreover, whether there is a synergetic effect between dexamethasone and clarithromycin on crs treatment is also an interesting topic for future investigation.
