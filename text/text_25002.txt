BACKGROUND
next-generation sequencing technology  allows a much deeper characterization of the structure of microbial communities using metagenomic approaches. metagenomic surveys often use a hypervariable region of the highly-conserved and universal 16s rrna gene as a phylogenetic marker. bias introduced in the processing steps of such surveys masks the true community composition so that there are large discrepancies in the proportion of gram negative bacteria observed using next generation sequencing, microscopy, and culture-based methods  <cit> . an objective of microbiome experiments is to characterize the community composition, including the relative quantities of species in sampled environments. an accurate depiction of microbial community composition via next generation sequencing requires a careful consideration of bias introduced during sample processing  <cit> .

many sources of bias have been identified in 16s rrna studies using ngs including pcr amplification  <cit> , dna extraction protocol  <cit> , sequencing artifacts  <cit> , dna copy number  <cit> , sampling depth  <cit> , and primer design  <cit> . previous studies typically isolate one or two sources of bias, suggest experimental practices that mitigate the effects, and acknowledge that other sources of bias remain. examples of recommendations for mitigating bias include performing triple dna extraction  <cit> , using multiple combinations of dna extraction and pcr amplification protocols  <cit> , and reducing the number of pcr cycles to avoid chimera formation  <cit> .

few studies have attempted to create models for neutralizing bias in environmental samples. one exception is a strategy proposed for counteracting the portion of bias due to differences in dna copy number among bacteria  <cit> . the method applies a phylogenetic and ancestral state placement of sample sequences among a reference database of bacteria with known 16s copy numbers.

we perceive the need for three kinds of quality control in microbiome experiments. the first is the need to monitor batch effects of different sample processing runs. the use of identical mock  samples as positive controls and sequencing pure pcr product as a negative control can help to identify problems with batches and drift. the second type of quality control is based on the variation produced by the choice of sample processing protocols. the same sample processed at labs that use different protocols can produce different results. the microbiome quality control project  <cit>  is studying the effects of different choices in protocols and seeks to understand which choices contribute the most to variation. the third type of quality control is understanding the difference between observed and actual community compositions for particular choices of protocols for a lab. depending on the environment of interest, labs will engineer their procedures so that they are sure to detect organisms of interest for the particular environment. understanding the bias resulting from these choices of protocols is important because no matter what choice is made, bias will remain. the experiment reported here was designed to understand the magnitude and nature of bias introduced by a particular choice of protocols.

the methodology proposed here represents, to our knowledge, the first attempt to  create comprehensive models for predicting community composition in environmental samples based on observed proportions,  quantify the contribution of bias of different sample processing steps in 16s experiments, and  identify statistically significant relationships between bacterial signals. additional distinguishing features of this study include the deep sequencing employed and the species-level taxonomic classification of reads.

this paper proposes a set of mixture experiments involving small “mock” communities, artificial microbial communities created by mixing known quantities of bacterial isolates, dna clones, or pcr product. mock communities are often used for ground-truthing and quantifying bias  <cit> . while mixture experiments occur most frequently in areas such as chemistry and agriculture, they have also been applied in the biological sciences. mixture designs can be used for screening complex medium components in the cultivation of bacteria and evaluating the influence of nutrients on bacterial byproducts and growth  <cit> . for instance, kiviharju et al.  <cit>  apply a mixture design for the screening of suitable complex medium components in the cultivation of s. peucetius var. caesius, an aerobic bacterium that produces doxorubicin as a secondary metabolite. rispoli and shah  <cit>  use mixture experiments to evaluate the influence of six nutrient elements on production of cutinase from the fungus colletotrichum lindemuthianum. for other examples, see  <cit> .

we report on an application of the proposed experimental protocol to an analysis of seven vaginally-relevant bacteria and apply the results to clinical samples.

RESULTS
different dna extraction kits introduced different bias
we analyzed a single mock community and varied the dna extraction kit and the number of pcr cycles. the mock community consists of  <dig> bacterial/archaeal strains from  <dig> genera  <cit>  that are not necessarily associated with the human vagina. taxonomic classification was performed using the rdp classifier  <cit>  . the choice of dna extraction kit led to the most striking differences between the protocols tested . relative to the powersoil kit, using the qiagen kit increased the observed proportion of enterococcus by about 50% while suppressing the observed proportions of neisseria, bacillus, pseudomonas, and porphyromonas. in contrast, changing the number of pcr cycles from  <dig> to  <dig> affected the observed proportions only slightly. the small changes due to pcr cycle number agree with previous studies that showed that while chimera formation increases with cycle number, the observed community structure is retained  <cit> .

each combination of extraction kit and cycle number produced results that were dramatically different from the actual mixing proportions. the differences between the observed and actual proportions were different for the different extraction kits. the results for each of the samples produced underestimates of lactobacillus  and streptococcus .

mixture experiments and mixture effect models for quantifying and characterizing bias in 16s metagenomic studies
a mixture design is an experiment in which a response of interest is assumed to depend only on the relative proportions of the components present in the mixture. if the response changes when the proportions of those components making up the mixture are altered, then the response is said to be a measure of the joint blending property of the components of the mixture  <cit> . the distinguishing feature of mixture experiments is that the mixture components are subject to a constraint requiring that the proportions sum to one. due to this constraint on the mixture components, non-standard statistical models are required to model the response. mixture effect models  <cit>  allow for prediction of the response for given proportions of mixture components as well as evaluation of relationships among the components.

we developed the following protocol for quantifying and characterizing bias in 16s metagenomic studies:
decide upon a small subset of bacteria whose measurement is of interest. we selected seven vaginally-relevant species based on their prevalence in clinical samples, suspected importance in disease mechanisms, and ability to be cultured.

based on the number of bacteria selected and the number of runs available, generate an experimental design. the 80-run mixture experiment for our application was a d-optimal design  <cit>  containing  <dig> unique treatment combinations and  <dig> replicate samples. replicate runs were used to obtain an estimate of the pure error variance.

the d-optimal design that we used requires at least  <dig> runs:
 73+72+7= <dig>   in order to fit a special cubic model . the  <dig> additional runs in the design included two other unique treatment combination for testing lack of fit and  <dig> replicates. with n bacteria, the same design would require the number obtained by replacing  <dig> with n in the formula above. for example, an analogous model for  <dig> bacteria would require a minimum of  <dig> runs.

randomize the design for three mixture experiments. the treatment combinations and placement on plates were randomized to alleviate effects of bias due to experimental conditions. each row of the experimental design in additional file  <dig> contains a treatment combination that prescribes the proportion of cells, dna, or pcr product from each strain of bacteria used in the construction of a mock community.

prepare and process mock communities according to the experimental design. preparing mock communities for each experiment is described below and illustrated in figure  <dig> 
 experiment  <dig>  create mock communities by mixing prescribed quantities of cells from each organism. grow each isolate to exponential phase and determine cell density through estimates of viable cell counts and optical density; the combined approach improves the accuracy of estimates. combine bacteria to form mock communities and subject the samples to dna extraction, pcr amplification, sequencing, and taxonomic classification.schematic of three mixture experiments and observed results. in experiment  <dig>  bacterial cultures were mixed so that communities were comprised of equal numbers of cells. in experiment  <dig>  dna was extracted from pure bacterial cultures and then mixed so that communities were comprised of equal amounts of dna. in experiment  <dig>  dna was extracted from pure bacterial cultures and subjected to pcr and pcr product was mixed so that communities are comprised of equal amounts of pcr product. the pie charts in the bottom row are the observed results for a sample that consisted of equal proportions of seven bacteria for each experiment. the pie charts in the other rows represent the prescribed mixing ratios . key: red - g. vaginalis, orange - s. agalactiae, purple - s. amnii,green - p. bivia, light blue - l. iners, yellow - l. crispatus, brown - a. vaginae.



 experiment  <dig>  create mock communities by mixing proportions of gdna. extract gdna from pure cultures of each bacterial strain. measure dna concentration and mix in the proportions described by the experimental design. then process each sample by pcr amplification, sequencing, and taxonomic classification.

 experiment  <dig>  create mock communities by mixing equal proportions of pcr product. begin by extracting gdna from the pure cultures of each bacterial species. subject the pure gdna to pcr amplification. mix the pcr products according to the experimental design. sequence each sample and classify the reads.



compare the differences in the results of each experiment. comparing the results of experiment  <dig> with the prescribed mixing ratios gives a measurement of the total bias. if xi is the prescribed mixing ratio for bacterium i and x^i is the observed proportion, then the bias is the difference x^i−xi. a negative value indicates that the bacterial signal is suppressed, while a positive value indicates that the signal is amplified.

comparing the results of experiments  <dig> and  <dig> isolates the effects of the dna extraction protocol. similarly, comparing the results of experiments  <dig> and  <dig> isolates the effects of bias due to the pcr amplification protocol. comparing the results of experiment  <dig> with the prescribed mixing ratios isolates the effects of sequencing and taxonomic classification. the pie charts at the bottom of figure  <dig> show the results for a sample that contained equal proportions of the seven bacteria for each of our experiments. similar information would be generated for each mock community in each experiment, facilitating analysis via modeling.

fit mixture effect models to regress the observed proportions of reads against functions of the prescribed mixing ratios. significant terms in the models can reveal pairs or groups of bacteria that, when present together in a sample, amplify or suppress the observed proportions of other bacteria.

fit models to regress the prescribed mixing ratios against the observed proportions of reads for prediction of actual community composition based on the observed community composition. use cross-validation to estimate accuracy for clinical/environmental samples.



in the sections that follow, we report on the results of our application of this protocol for seven species: atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, prevotella bivia, sneathia amnii, and streptococcus agalactiae.

contaminating bacteria did not significantly contribute to bias in small mock communities
a total of  <dig>  million reads were generated for  <dig> samples across three experiments involving seven vaginally-relevant bacteria. taxonomic classification was performed using the stirrups method and reference database  <cit> . only  <dig>   below-threshold reads and  <dig>  above-threshold reads were assigned to taxa not in the study. none of the samples had large proportions of reads assigned to taxa not in the study .

the three experiments consisted of mixing live bacteria, extracted dna, and pcr product according to prescribed proportions . of the  <dig> samples in each experiment,  <dig> were technical replicates; i.e., there were  <dig> unique mixtures,  <dig> of which were repeated. the median absolute error, a measure of the technical variation among replicates, of the observed proportion of each organism was largest for the experiment mixing prescribed quantities of pcr product; the median absolute error was smallest for mixing live bacteria . for all bacteria and experiments, the median absolute error was less than 5%. therefore, technical variation was not a confounding factor in our results.

our dna extraction and pcr amplification protocols contributed more to bias than sequencing error and taxonomic misclassification
the results when mixing prescribed proportions of live bacteria, extracted dna, and pcr product can be used to isolate the effects of the dna extraction protocol, the pcr amplification protocol, and sequencing error and taxonomic classification.

bacteria were collected from late log cultures and correlated with od  <dig> nm to minimize the number of non-viable bacteria within the cultures. however, there was likely some contribution of dna from non-viable bacteria and this would be expected to contribute to the bias. in these experiments, bias due to differing numbers of non-viable bacteria would not be distinguishable from bias due to our dna extraction protocol. throughout the remainder of the paper, it is implied that the bias due to dna extraction includes bias due to non-viable bacteria.

a box plot of the bias for all mixtures for each of the three experiments and for each of the seven bacteria is plotted in figure  <dig>  the bias due to sequencing and classification was smallest, as indicated by the fact that the median bias was between -5% and 5% for each bacterium, and by the small inter-quartile ranges. the bias due to our dna extraction protocol and our pcr amplification protocol contributed the most to total bias. our observation that our pcr amplification protocol contributed more to bias than sequencing-specific causes confirms the results of a previous study  <cit> . sequencing and classification error effects were likely reduced in our experiment because of the small numbers of bacteria in samples. also, the use of a carefully-curated database and species-level classification method  <cit>  likely helped to filter chimeric sequences.observed bias by bacterium. the observed bias  for each bacterium in the experimental design due to the different effects of our dna extraction, pcr amplification, and sequencing and taxonomic classification protocols. the total bias is also plotted for each bacterium. for each box and whisker plot, only the samples including the bacterium were included.



the effects of our dna extraction and pcr amplification protocols were dependent on bacteria
the inter-quartile ranges for bias from our dna extraction protocol indicated that our protocol amplified the observed proportions of l. crispatus, l. iners, p. bivia, and s. amnii while suppressing those of a. vaginae, s. agalactiae, and g. vaginalis. the same analysis for our pcr amplification protocol shows that the observed proportions of a. vaginae, l. iners, and s. amnii were increased while those of s. agalactiae, g. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and p. bivia were decreased. with the exception of bias due to our pcr amplification protocol and sequencing and classification for a. vaginae and p. bivia, the bias was significantly different from zero .

the effect of each processing step  was dependent on the bacterium. the bias due to the different processing steps appeared to be independent because the bias from each step was cumulative and was reflected in the results for the total bias for each bacterium. the total bias is the observed proportion minus the proportion of cells included in the mixture in the first experiment. overall, the observed proportions of a. vaginae, s. agalactiae, g. vaginalis, and l. crispatus was less than the proportions of bacteria in the mixtures, and the observed proportions of l. iners and s. amnii was more than the proportions in the mixtures. the inter-quartile range for total bias for mixtures containing p. bivia was large and contains zero, indicating that the bias was affected by which particular bacteria were also included in a mixture. the median total bias for s. agalactiae was - <dig> %, indicating that in a mixture containing s. agalactiae, we would expect to observe that its proportion would be  <dig> % less than its true representation in the community. the largest positive median bias among the bacteria was  <dig> % for s. amnii.

previous studies observed that the copy number and genome size may not be consequential sources of bias  <cit> . the analysis here appears to agree that these factors were not sufficient to describe bias in the pcr step. for example, s. agalactiae had the largest copy number among the organisms in this experiment, but the observed proportions were consistently less than the actual proportions in the mock communities.

observed proportions of bacteria were amplified or suppressed by the presence of other bacteria
the interquartile range for bias due to our dna extraction protocol was larger than that for bias due to our pcr amplification protocol or sequencing and classification for all but one bacterium , but the technical variation was largest when mixing pure pcr product . therefore, the wider ranges of bias due to our dna extraction protocol was likely due to some relationship between bacterial signals. here we present a deeper analysis of the effects observed at each step.

in traditional mixture experiment terminology, an interaction is a causative effect in the observed proportions of bacteria that may or may not reflect a physical relationship between the bacteria. the effect could be a result of a difference in proclivity to use resources. for example, one bacterium could yield more sequences in pcr product than another because of template re-annealing or primer design. for a bacterium a, there is a synergistic interaction with bacterium b if the presence of bacterium b increases the observed proportion of bacterium a. likewise, there is an antagonistic interaction with bacterium b if the presence of bacterium b decreases the observed proportion of bacterium a. because the term “interaction” is often interpreted in common use to connote a physical effect, we attempt to avoid the confusion and use the terms “relationship”, “synergistic relationship”, and “antagonistic relationship”.

comparison of the prescribed proportions of bacteria with the results of the experiment mixing live bacteria can be used to evaluate whether the observed proportions of bacteria are promoted or suppressed by the presence of other bacteria. special cubic mixture effect models, where the dependent variable is the observed proportion of a bacterium, reveal statistically significant blends of bacteria . each model has linear terms that capture the main effects of having bacteria present in the sample along with quadratic and cubic blending terms that capture higher-order relationships.

the model fits were clearly strong as indicated by r <dig> values above  <dig>  for each model. as expected from the results in figure  <dig>  there were far fewer statistically significant blending terms for the models based on mixing equal amounts of pcr product than for those based on mixing equal numbers of cells or those based on mixing equal quantities of dna . the binary blends tended to be more statistically significant than ternary blends. the number of significant blending terms decreased for each subsequent experiment, as would be expected because the sources of bias due to our dna extraction and pcr amplification protocols were removed. the interaction terms that were significant for the models for mixing cells  but not significant for the models for mixing dna  highlight relationships for our dna extraction protocol. similarly, those terms that were significant for the models for mixing dna  but not significant for the models mixing pcr product  highlight relationships for our pcr amplification protocol.the number of significant blending terms  for each mixture effect model

the models for the experiment mixing cells generated interaction/blending plots as shown in figure  <dig>  as an example, figure  <dig> depicts the blending of l. crispatus and g. vaginalis. for a given concentration of l. crispatus, as more g. vaginalis is added to a sample , the expected proportion of observed l. crispatus will increase. therefore, g. vaginalis interacts synergistically with l. crispatus. the hypoteneuse of the triangle reflects the expected results when l. crispatus and g. vaginalis are the only bacteria in a mixture. the shaded contours if the remainder of the triangle indicate the expected observed l. crispatus proportion, averaging over the effects of including the other bacteria in the experiment at proportions resulting in a mixture that sums to 100%. the figure, therefore, depicts the expected relationship between two bacteria when included in blends at different levels.interaction/blending plots for

additional file  <dig> depicts the ratio of the observed l. crispatus to actual l. crispatus versus the proportion of g. vaginalis and s. amnii. the trend lines and the departures from y= <dig>  help to indicate the blending effect. the wide variation in the data around the model indicated that the identities of the additional bacteria in a mixture were important for predicting the observed proportions of l. crispatus. tables  <dig> and  <dig> contain the statistically significant synergistic and antagonistic binary blends for the experiment based on mixing equal numbers of cells. the significant relationships are ordered by decreasing significance. nearly all of the bacteria were synergistic with l. iners and s. amnii, and nearly all are antagonistic with g. vaginalis. g. vaginalis was synergistic with all bacteria except s. agalactiae. all bacteria were antagonistic with s. agalactiae. these results indicate that the observed proportions of l. iners and s. amnii in samples were overestimates while those for g. vaginalis and s. agalactiae were underestimates.significant synergistic binary blends ordered by effect size

among most samples with equal amounts of cells, rank abundance in the biased results was preserved. in other words, if for a pair of bacteria present in a sample the first is observed to comprise a larger proportion than the second, then the observed proportion for the first bacterium is larger than the second in most of the other samples containing those bacteria. a notable exception is depicted in table  <dig>  sample  <dig> contained equal proportions of s. amnii, l. iners, and s. agalactiae. because of bias, more s. amnii than l. iners was observed in sample  <dig> in table  <dig>  and very little s. agalactiae was detected. sample  <dig> also contained equal proportions of s. amnii and l. iners along with g. vaginalis and p. bivia. for this sample, more l. iners was observed than s. amnii. the differences were larger than the technical variation depicted in additional file  <dig>  therefore, rank abundance was not preserved for l. iners and s. amnii. it is not clear whether the result was due to the larger number of bacteria in the samples than other samples, which is more representative of clinical and environmental samples, or was a reflection of tertiary and higher-order effects between combinations of bacteria.actual and observed proportions of bacteria for two mock community samples containing

mixture effect models predicted community composition in clinical samples
models constructed via an inverse fit  can be applied to the observed proportions of bacteria in clinical samples to estimate the true community composition. figure  <dig> depicts the observed and predicted proportions of bacteria for samples from the mid-vaginal wall of a subject over the course of four visits to a clinic. low diversity and richness in vaginal samples, such as that observed for this subject, is not unusual  <cit> . observed and  predicted proportions of bacteria of four clinical samples. the samples are from the same subject in different visits.



because of the low diversity, vaginal samples are often classified by the predominant bacterium into community states or types  <cit> . the first sample, unadjusted, would be categorized as being of the l. iners type. however, the inverse models predicted that the true composition of the bacterial community was dominated by g. vaginalis. in our analysis of samples of the l. iners type from other subjects, we often observed subgroups consisting of those with nontrivial levels of g. vaginalis as in sample  <dig> and those with little as in sample  <dig> .

the bacteria common to the clinical samples and the mixture effect experiments were g. vaginalis, l. iners, and a. vaginae. g. vaginalis is often associated with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis  and an elevated ph. l. iners and a. vaginae are lactic acid-producing bacteria known to lower ph. the observed proportion of g. vaginalis was larger for sample  <dig> than sample  <dig> and the proportion of lactic acid-producing bacteria was smaller, yet the ph was higher for sample  <dig>  the predicted proportions aligned better with the ph measurements. sample  <dig> was predicted to have the highest proportion of lactic acid-producing bacteria and was associated with the lowest ph, samples  <dig> and  <dig> had similar proportions of g. vaginalis and were associated with the same ph, and sample  <dig> had the largest proportion of g. vaginalis and was associated with the highest ph. though samples  <dig> and  <dig> had the highest proportions of g. vaginalis and the highest measured phs, there was no diagnosis. the lack of symptoms and/or disease may have been due to the presence of a. vaginae.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that models based on analysis of small mock communities can enhance our understanding of bias and the analysis of low-diversity environments such as the human vagina. the same protocol could be applied to bacteria from more diverse environments such as the human gut or soil samples to understand how the most dominant species are affected by bias. as demonstrated here, a good understanding of bias can change and improve the conclusions based on the analysis of clinical or environmental samples.

we recommend that labs use small mock communities for understanding the effects of bias for their particular choices of protocols. fitting mixture effect models is useful for establishing statistical significance concerning the relationship between observed proportions for pairs of bacteria. though our results from a full mixture experiment and mixture effect models were informative, it is perhaps excessive for validating a pipeline. smaller sets of mock communities, with around 10- <dig> blends of bacteria, are likely sufficient for labs to assess the effects of bias for certain taxa so that analysis may be qualitatively hedged. for example, if our lab observes clinical samples with both l. iners and g. vaginalis, we may presume that l. iners is likely over-estimated and g. vaginalis is under-estimated.

additional experiments with axial blends and blends of larger numbers of bacteria are needed to understand if rank abundance is preserved. using the protocol presented here to model bias for more diverse environments would require the creation and analysis of an impracticable number of mock communities because of the number of bacteria that need to be modeled. therefore, it is necessary to further understand the factors contributing to bias from dna extraction and pcr amplification protocols such as cell lysability, primer efficiency, gram negativity, and gc content. models based on these factors, along with careful curation of reference databases containing such information, could enhance the interpretation of results from studies of diverse communities.

the results presented here indicate that bias due to our dna extraction and pcr amplification protocols are much greater than the effects of sequencing and taxonomic classification. therefore, we can expect that bias will remain a challenge even as sequencing technology advances. the effects of bias can lead to the discovery of spurious correlations  and to missed true correlations. the results of ground-truthing with small mock communities can help to hedge conclusions obtained by analyzing observed relative quantities. efforts to assess bias within labs as proposed here and guidelines for best practices across labs, a goal of the microbiome quality control project  <cit> , will facilitate the extraction of more useful information from experiments in various domains.
