BACKGROUND
despite the availability of an effective prophylactic vaccine and potent antiviral therapies hepatitis b virus  is still a major health problem. over  <dig> million people chronic hepatitis b virus  carriers worldwide remain at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma   <cit> . the persistence of viral replication in the liver and high serum hbv-dna levels correlate with disease severity, progression of liver fibrosis and hcc development in the clinical setting  <cit> .

the hbv regulatory protein hbx is both required for hbv replication  <cit>  and implicated in hbv-related oncogenesis  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic activities of hbx have been only partially elucidated. hbx regulates transcription both directly, at the chromatin level, and indirectly, by affecting intracellular signaling pathways that modulate the activity of multiple transcription factors  <cit> . hbx has been shown to target the epigenetic control of cellular genes expression by interacting with chromatin modifying enzymes . hbx is also recruited to the cccdna in hbv-infected cells  <cit>  and is required for the transcription of all viral rnas from the cccdna minichromosome in the nucleus  <cit> . hbx is thought to regulate cccdna transcription by two main mechanisms: a) the degradation of the smc5/ <dig> restriction factor mediated by the ddb <dig> – cul <dig> e <dig> ligase complex  <cit>  and b) the prevention of cccdna epigenetic silencing by the histone deacetilase hdac <dig>  <cit> , the protein arginine n-methyltransferase  <dig>   <cit> , the tudor-domain protein spindlin- <dig>  <cit>  and the histone methyl-transferase setdb <dig>  <cit> . additional hbx activities that boost hbv replication are dna methyltransferase  <dig> alpha  downregulation mediated by mir- <dig> induction  <cit> , the elevation of cytosolic calcium levels  <cit>  and the induction of autophagy  <cit> .

RESULTS
chip-seq analysis of genome wide hbx recruitment
to obtain a high-resolution, unbiased, mapping of hbx binding sites across the genome we sequenced hbx-bound fragments by chip-seq in a cccdna-driven hbv replication system  <cit> . four independent anti-hbx paired chips were carried out on formaldehyde-crosslinked chromatin from mock and hbv-transfected hepg <dig> cells. on average, ~62% of the reads could be aligned to the hg <dig> version of the human genome ; ~1% of the total number of reads aligned to the hbv genome  and ~1% of reads falls on the mitochondrial genome. all reads with multiple alignments and mismatches with the reference genomes were excluded . ~ <dig> statistically significant peaks/run  were detected. about 12% of the hbx peaks were located within 10kb from the transcription start site  of known genes,  <dig> % were located in intergenic regions and  <dig> % within introns .

functional analysis of the genes potentially regulated by hbx
we first performed a functional enrichment analysis of the whole genome repertoire of the genes potentially regulated by hbx in hbv replicating hepg <dig> cells. figure 1a shows the categories enriched, respectively, among the kegg and reactome biological pathways; the gene ontology  biological processes and the interpro families, a database that integrates diverse information about protein families, domains and functional sites. overall, the results show a significant enrichment in genes involved in cell metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer, but also in biological pathways that have been associated with the control of hbv replication . it is important to underline that, since the hbx chip-seq dataset was generated in hbv replicating hepg <dig> cells, which are derived from a primary liver tumor, and that an enrichment in genes belonging to the metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer pathways is often found in many immortalized and transformed cell lines, a number of the hbx genomic binding sites we found might reflect a bias for transcriptionally active chromatin regions in the “tumor cell” chromatin environment.fig.  <dig> functional analysis of protein-coding genes potentially regulated by hbx. a biological pathways , biological processes  and protein families, domains and important sites  over-represented  from the analysis of ~ <dig> protein-coding genes with hbx-binding sites are shown. in each plot, the categories are in descending order with respect to the associated gene number, with the corresponding color scale of p-values shown on the right. b validation of hbx occupancy on selected gene promoters in independent chip experiments. chip results are expressed as fold induction  of the % of input. histograms show the mean from three independent experiments; bars indicate sd. p-values: *  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ; **  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ; ***  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> . gene specific promoter primer pairs are detailed in additional file 1: table s6




independent anti-hbx chip experiments confirmed hbx recruitment, with a  <dig> to 8-fold enrichment relative to the control igg chiped samples, to the promoter regions of selected genes belonging to different functional categories  in hbv replicating hepg <dig> cells  and in hbv-infected ntcp-hepg <dig> cells  and primary human hepatocytes from  <dig> different donors .

validated pcr primers for genomic target sites that were negative for anti-hbx chip-seq peak assignment showed no enrichment in the hbx immunoprecipitated chromatin, thus confirming the lack of off-target hbx recruitment and the specificity of the anti-hbx chip .

hbx directly enhances endocytosis
the enrichment of genes involved in endocytosis among hbx targets  represents a potential link between its role in viral replication  <cit>  and its contribution to liver cancer development  <cit> . our chip-seq analysis showed that hbx is recruited and potentially regulates  <dig> members of the ras-related in brain  gtpase family of genes, including several rab gtpases implicated in endocytosis . hbx binding to the rab1a, rab2b and rab5b promoter regions  was accompanied by an increase in promoter-bound histone h <dig> acetylation  and rab1a, rab2b and rab5b expression  in hbv-wt replicating cells but not in hbx-mt replicating cells. the upregulation of rab1a, rab2b and rab5b expression was confirmed in hbv-infected ntcp-hepg <dig> cells  and human primary hepatocytes  . the specificity of hbx binding to the rab1a, rab2b and rab5b promoter regions was further confirmed in ntcp-hepg <dig> cells infected with hbv-wt and hbx-mt virus . notably, hbv-wt hepg <dig> replicating cells showed a robust uptake of transferrin, with intense perinuclear accumulation, whereas transferrin distribution was more diffuse in mock hepg <dig> cells and in hbx-mt hepg <dig> replicating cells due to a diminished rate of transferrin internalization .fig.  <dig> hbx chip-seq identifies direct target genes involved in endocytosis. a h <dig> acetylation on rab1a, rab2b, rab5b, srebp <dig> and beclin  <dig> genes promoters assessed in independent chip experiments. anti-ach <dig> chiped chromatin from mock, hbv-wt and hbx-mt hbv replicating hepg2 cells and ntcp-hepg <dig> hbv-infected cells. results are expressed as in fig. 1b. b–d qpcr quantification of rab1a, rab2b rab5b, srebp <dig> and beclin- <dig> mrna levels in mock, hbv-wt and hbx-mt hepg <dig> cells replicating hbv  hbv-infected ntcp-hepg <dig>  and phhs . results are expressed as fold induction relative to the mock-transfected/infected controls  after normalization to endogenous human β-actin mrnas. data represent means ± sd from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. p-values: *  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ; **  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ; ***  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig>

hbx is also recruited to and potentially regulates several genes involved in autophagy, including beclin- <dig>  srebp <dig> and several members of the atg  gene family . hbv has been show to induce er stress and cellular autophagy, which is known to enhance viral replication and virions assembly  <cit> . beclin- <dig> is a major effector of autophagy in mammalian cells and has been shown to be upregulated in hbv-related hccs, hbx-overexpressing cells and  <dig> . <dig> hbv replicating cells  <cit> . the srebp- <dig> transcription factor, known to be a major regulator of cholesterol metabolism, has also been involved in the direct activation of several genes involved in autophagy  <cit> . hbx recruitment to the beclin- <dig> and srebp2/mir-33a promoter regions was confirmed in independent chip experiments performed in hbv-wt replicating cells . hbv-wt replicating cells, but not hbx-mt replicating cells, displayed higher levels of histone h <dig> acetylation on the beclin- <dig> and srebp <dig> promoters as compared to hbv mock cells  and increased expression of beclin- <dig> and srebp <dig> . these results were confirmed in hbv-infected ntcp-hepg <dig> cells  and hbv-infected human primary hepatocytes  . altogether, these results indicate that hbx targets endocytosis and autophagy gene expression in hbv replicating cells.

chip-seq identifies ncrnas directly targeted by hbx
analyses of the distribution of all the anti-hbx chip-seq peaks revealed the occurrence of putative hbx binding sites in  <dig> lncrna promoters and  <dig> lncrna intragenic regions, in  <dig> snorna,  <dig> snrna and  <dig> mirna promoter regions .  <dig> out of the  <dig> hbx targeted mirnas are classified as intragenic  <cit>  and  <dig> of them display hbx peaks in the promoter region of their target genes. independent anti-hbx chip experiments in hbv replicating hepg <dig> cells , hbv-infected ntcp-hepg <dig> cells  and phhs  confirmed hbx binding to selected mirna promoters . primers designed to overlap an hbx peak detected with a higher p-value  showed no enrichment in anti-hbx chiped dna .fig.  <dig> chip-seq mirna peak validation and hbx targeted mirnas expression. a hbx occupancy on the putative promoter regions  of selected mirnas  was validated in independent chip experiments. cross-linked chromatin from mock or hbv-wt replicating hepg <dig> cells was immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-hbx antibody or relevant igg controls, and then analyzed by real-time qpcr using specific primer pairs . chip results are expressed as fold induction  of the % of input and the histograms show the mean from three independent experiments; bars indicate sd. b–c mirna profiles were analyzed by real-time qpcr, and normalized with respect to rnu <dig>  in mock, hbv-wt and hbx-mt replicating hepg <dig> cells  and by taqman pcr-arrays in hbv infected  phhs . data represent means ± sd from at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. d hbx recruitment impacts on h <dig> histone acetylation of neighboring chromatin promoters. anti-ach <dig> chips were performed and analysed as in a). p-values: *  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ; **  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> ; ***  <dig>  ≤ p <  <dig> 




the  <dig> mirnas targeted by hbx include several mirnas that have been implicated in the regulation of specific liver functions , in hbv replication , in hepatocarcinogenesis , cancer  and others the function of which is not yet known  . the analysis of the selected mirna promoter sequences bound by hbx using the genomatix matinspector resource showed the presence of binding sites for multiple transcription factors that have been reported to interact with hbx, including nfat, creb, nfkb, srebp <dig>  stat, e2f and smad  <cit> , a finding consistent with a mechanism of piggy-backing for hbx mediated by multiple transcription factors .

next, we analyzed the impact of hbx chromatin recruitment on the expression of hbx targeted mirnas. figure 4b shows the differential expression, analyzed by real-time qpcr, of the  <dig> mirnas encoded from the  <dig> promoters used for the independent validation of hbx chromatin recruitment in fig. 4a.  <dig> mirnas  are consistently upregulated  and  <dig> mirnas  are downregulated  in hbv-wt hepg <dig> replicating cells.  <dig> mirnas  are apparently not modulated or only slightly modulated by hbv replication in this assay . notably, concordant results were obtained for 9/ <dig> mirnas included in the mirnas taqman microarrays profiles from hbv-infected  phhs . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  that were only slightly up-regulated  <dig> h after transfection in hbv-replicating hepg <dig> cells, were significantly up-regulated in phh  <dig> days after infection. hbv up-regulation of mir- <dig> expression is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . mir- <dig> was dowregulated in hbv-wt replicating hepg <dig> cells at  <dig> h withouth reaching < <dig>  fold threshold but its levels were significantly reduced in hbv-infected phh. mir- <dig> was dowregulated  <dig> h after transfection in hbv-wt replicating hepg <dig> cells and significantly upregulated in hbv-infected phh.

hbx recruitment impacts on h <dig> histone acetylation of neighboring chromatin promoters. as shown in fig. 4d, h <dig> acetylation was decreased on the promoter regions of mir-138- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-302e, mir-576-3p and mir- <dig>  all repressed by hbx. conversely, hbx recruitment was accompanied by an increased h <dig> acetylation at the mir-26b promoter , whose expression is activated in hbv-wt replicating hepg <dig> cells and hbv-infected phh . these results confirm the hbx ability to influence transcription by directly modulating the epigenetic status of target promoters and provide a mechanism for mirna repression by hbx.

a subset of hbx targeted mirnas represses hbv replication
a number of mirnas directly or indirectly promote or repress hbv replication . thus, mir- <dig> abrogates p53-mediated inhibition of hbv replication by targeting cyclin g <dig> and its interaction with p <dig>  <cit> . mir-372/ <dig> and mir- <dig> promote hbv gene expression by targeting the transcription factor nuclear factor i/b  <cit>  and hbxip  <cit> , respectively. mir- <dig> increases hbv transcription and replication by targeting hdac <dig>  which in turn represses hbv transcription  <cit> . mir-15b potentiates hbv replication by targeting hnf1a and relieving its repressive activity on hbv enhancer  <dig>  <cit> . conversely, mir- <dig> suppresses hbv expression and replication in hepg <dig> cells by targeting ppara  <cit>  and mir-130a inhibits hepatitis b virus replication by targeting pgc1α and pparγ  <cit> . mir-199a-3p and mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-15a/mir-16- <dig>  <cit> , the mir-17- <dig> cluster  <cit>  and mir- <dig>  <cit>  have been shown to target hbv mrnas directly and to inhibit hbv replication. none of these mirnas showed hbx recruitment in our chip-seq analysis, neither to their putative promoter sequence nor to the promoter regions of their host genes, with the exception of mir-15a and mir <dig>  that are embedded into the dleu <dig> lncrna gene, the promoter of which harbors an hbx binding peak.

we investigated whether the mirnas repressed by hbx binding to their regulatory regions might directly target hbv transcripts, and in particular the hbv pgrna. hbx repression could relieve the mirna-directed down-regulation of hbv replication and unveal new mirna–dependent auto-regulatory loops in hbv replicating cells. in silico analysis revealed the presence of several putative seed sequences on the hbv genome specific for hbx-regulated mirnas, which are also conserved across hbv genotypes . as shown in fig. 5a, pre-mir- <dig>  pre-mir- <dig> and pre-mir- <dig> overexpression reduces hbv pgrna levels, whereas pre-mir-302e does not. similarly, pre-mir-26a <dig>  that is not modulated by hbv in our systems and we use as a control, did not affect hbv pgrna levels . notably, co-transfection of hbv-wt together with pre-mir-138- <dig>  pre-mir- <dig>  and pre-mir- <dig> resulted in a significant reduction of hbv replication, measured as cytoplasmic core particles associated rchbv-dna . altogether, these results suggest that hbx repression of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> expression relieves the negative effects of these mirnas on hbv replication. on the other hand, mir-302e likely downregulates hbv regulation indirectly, by targeting one or more genes involved in the regulation of hbv replication.fig.  <dig> impact of hbx-targeted mirnas on  <dig> kb/pgrna transcription and hbv replication. a hepg <dig> cells are co-transfected with linear wild type hbv genomes  and the indicated pre-hsa-mirnas. hbv  <dig> kb/pgrna levels were determined by real-time qpcr using specific primers. results were expressed as fold induction relative to mock controls  after normalization towards endogenous human β-actin mrnas. b rchbv-dna levels associated to cytoplasmatic core particles were determined by real-time qpcr after normalization to β-globin. histograms represent the mean from  <dig> independent experiments; bars indicate sds. p values were determined using the student’s t test. *p <  <dig> . c dnmt3a and p <dig> recruitment on mir <dig> promoter. chiped chromatin from mock and hbv-wt replicating hepg <dig> cells. results are expressed as in fig. 4a. d

in order to better characterize the interplay between hbx, hbx-targeted mirnas and hbv replication, we selected mir- <dig>  whose expression is repressed by hbv replication  and increased in hcc patients  where its expression is driven by the tnf/lt-nfkb signaling  <cit> . alignment of chip-seq hbx occupancy on the intronic mir- <dig> regulatory region revealed the presence of a nfkb/p <dig> consensus motif, which is known to be a direct transcriptional regulator of mir- <dig> expression and up-regulation in human hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . hbx recruitment is accompanied by a strong co-recruitment of p <dig> and the dnmt3a dna methyltransferase  in the same region of the mir- <dig> promoter, that is accompanied by an hypoacetylation of histone  <dig> lysines . we also show that exogenously expressed hbx repressed mir- <dig> promoter in a transient luciferase reporter assay . altogether these results strongly suggest the recruitment of hbx as part of a transcriptionally inactive nfkb/p <dig> complex on the mir- <dig> promoter, which is responsible for the silencing of mir- <dig> transcription.

next, to confirm that the inhibition of hbv replication by mir- <dig> is indeed the result of a direct targeting of hbv  <dig> kb/pgrna, the  <dig> putative seed sequences identified by the rnahybrid software in the hbv genome  were cloned at the 3′utr of the renilla luciferase gene in the prl-tk vector . co-transfection of the different renilla luciferase constructs together with pre-mir- <dig> showed a significative inhibition of the luciferase activity for constructs containing seed  <dig> and seed  <dig>  thus confirming that hbv is a direct target of mir- <dig> which inhibits viral replication by directly binding hbv genome on seed  <dig> and seed  <dig> .fig.  <dig> direct targeting of hbv  <dig> kb/pgrna by mir- <dig>  a in silico analysis of the hbv genome, performed with the rnahybrid tool on the bielefeld university bioinformatics server, revealed the presence of several putative mir- <dig> seed sequences that are conserved across hbv genotypes. b

discussion
our chip-seq genome wide analysis of hbx chromatin recruitment in hbv replicating cells provides a repertoire of genes and ncrnas directly targeted by hbx and led us to propose new mechanisms by which hbx potentiates hbv replication. as already mentioned, a possible limitation of our study is that our hbx chip-seq data set was generated in hbv replicating hepg <dig> cells, which are transformed cells derived from primary liver tumor, wild type for p <dig> and mutated for β-catenin. indeed, some of the “enriched genes” are associated with pathways, such as metabolism, chromatin dynamics and cancer, that are often found to be deregulated in transcriptomic analysis of immortalized and tumor cell lines. it cannot be excluded that a number of hbx genomic binding sites identified in our study might reflect a bias for transcriptionally active chromatin regions present in hepg <dig> cells. it is conceivable that the same regions might not be transcriptionally active, and therefore potentially not be targeted by hbx, in normal hepatocytes . however, strong clinical evidence links hbv replication with the development of hbv-related hccs and hbx expression has been widely implicated in hcc development and progression. thus, a repertoire of hbx genomic binding sites identified in a tumor derived hepatocytic cell line, such as the hepg <dig> cells, might be very relevant for hbv-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. most hbx targets validated in our study have been confirmed in primary hepatocytes from different donors and, notably, hbx is recruited very early post-infection on the regulatory sequence of mir- <dig>  a well established onco-mir, also in hbv-infected primary human hepatocytes.

we found that hbx activates several genes and mirnas that potentiate endocytosis and autophagy to favor hbv replication, and represses mirnas  that potentially target the hbv pgrna and would inhibit hbv replication . thus, hbx binding to the cccdna increases pgrna transcription and hbv replication and, at the same time, hbx protects the pgrna from the negative effects of mirnas mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> by targeting their promoters and inhibiting their expression. to better characterize the interplay between hbx, hbx targeted mirnas and hbv replication we focused on mir- <dig>  the down-regulation of mir- <dig> expression in hbv replicating cells  and hbv infected primary hepatocytes  is in apparent contradiction with the reported up-regulation of mir- <dig> in elevated in hcc  including hbv-related hccs  <cit> . notably, amaddeo et al. have reported that hbx inactivating mutations, including missense/stop and frameshift mutations as well as deletions, are selected in hbv-related hccs that carry a lower number of viral copies as compared to the non-tumor tissues  <cit> . although it would be challenging to obtain a formal demonstration in vivo, it is tempting to speculate that, in the early phases of hbv infection, hbx binding at or near the p65/nfkb sites in the mir- <dig> promoter leads to the repression of mir- <dig> expression, that would be detrimental for viral replication, whereas hbx inactivation leaves the mir- <dig> promoter free to respond to tnf/lt-nfkb signaling in hccs and highly displastic nodules.fig.  <dig> schematic representation of hbx-dependent mechanisms that contribute to boost hbv replication




CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of hbx genome wide chromatin recruitment provides a repertoire of genes and ncrnas directly targeted by hbx and led to the identification of new mechanisms by which hbx positively regulates cccdna transcription and hbv replication.
