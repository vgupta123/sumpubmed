BACKGROUND
neural plasticity is the mechanism by which information is stored and maintained within individual synapses, neurons, and neuronal circuits to guide organism behavior. neurite growth and remodeling represents a fundamental process during nervous system development, plasticity, and behavior. although neuronal plasticity allows the organism to adapt to a constantly evolving environment, little is known about the molecular components and pathways that support it. several myelin proteolipid protein  family members, such as m6a, m6b, and dm <dig>  <cit> , have been shown to be involved in neurite outgrowth and filopodium formation  <cit> . in addition, all plp family members share a common structure, which includes two extracellular loops that potentially interact with external ligands, and four transmembrane domains. the plp family is widely evolutionarily conserved from arthropods to mammals  <cit> . m6a, a membrane glycoprotein, is prominently expressed in the central nervous system, in particular in the hippocampus, cortex, forebrain, cerebellum, and retina  <cit> . several lines of evidence showed m6a participation in neural development, such as neurite extension and/or filopodium/spine formation in hippocampal  <cit> , retinal  <cit> , and cerebellar  <cit>  neurons, as well as in axonal growth  <cit> . indeed, m6ab, a zebra fish paralog of m6a, also exhibits similar functions  <cit> . m6a may also be required for filopodium motility and synaptogenesis  <cit>  and has been implicated in neuronal differentiation of human stem cells  <cit>  and pc <dig> cells  <cit> .

chronic social and physical stress decreases gpm6a mrna levels in the hippocampus, and this downregulation is prevented by administration of antidepressants  <cit> , which suggests that m6a participates in plastic hippocampal changes observed in stressed/antidepressant-treated animals. however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. interestingly, m6b and dm <dig> are also regulated by chronic stress  <cit> . in contrast, plp mrna, a dm <dig> splice variant, which is abundantly expressed in myelin of the central nervous system, is not regulated by stress  <cit> . however, plp participates in maintaining structural integrity of the myelin membrane. plp and dm <dig> have also been shown to form a complex with integrins in oligodendrocytes  <cit> .

previous work depicting major steps in plp evolution identified m <dig> as the ancestral gene of the plp family present in drosophila, maintaining a high degree of conservation in gene structure and amino acid sequence of the predicted protein compared with mouse m6a  <cit> , suggesting that m <dig> is the m6a fly ortholog. therefore, the role of m6a was analyzed in drosophila in the present study. in a previous study, we demonstrated that m <dig> localizes to the membrane of the ovary follicular epithelium, and m <dig> knockdown triggers female sterility  <cit> . loss of m <dig> in follicle cells also impairs eggshell formation and epithelial integrity, as well as organization. therefore, m <dig> plays an essential role in follicular epithelia maintenance, likely via membrane cell remodeling  <cit> . however, to date, there is no experimental evidence for m <dig> functional conservation, localization, or function in the fly nervous system.

to address the role of m6a in an intact nervous system, m <dig> relevance was characterized in adult flies. results identified novel m <dig> isoforms that were differentially expressed in the ovaries and heads. all m <dig> isoforms were structurally and functionally conserved, with one exception; this isoform exhibited a different subcellular localization most likely due to an altered protein structure, thereby giving rise to a non-functional isoform. m <dig> localization was detected in several brain structures, most remarkably in the optic lobe neuropil. in addition, m <dig> mutant flies exhibited a defective response to light. these results identified m <dig> as one of the molecular components underlying phototactic behavior, and together with m <dig> localization in the optic lobe, results suggests that m <dig> might play a role in the fly visual system.

methods
fly strains
flies were grown and maintained at 25 °c under a 12 h light/dark  cycle in vials containing standard cornmeal-agar medium. a w <dig> stock was used as the control. potential m <dig> mutant stocks y1w67c23; p{epgy2}m6ey07032w1118; p{gt1}m6bg <dig> and w1118; mi{et1}m6mb02608/ tm <dig>  sb <dig> ser <dig> were obtained from the bloomington stock center  <cit>  and were renamed m601m <dig> and m <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the ca <dig> stock  was obtained from the gfp protein trap database at the carnegie institution  <cit> . the m601m <dig> and m6gfp strains were backcrossed several generations to w <dig> to minimize background effects. the original p-element  from m <dig> was removed with the transposase  and the reverted p-excised allele was kept as m6Δ01-rev .

mrna isolation, rt-pcr and quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
heads and ovaries were dissected from well-fed young flies and homogenized in trizol reagent  to isolate total rna according to manufacturer´s instructions. then, polya + mrna was purified using the polyatract mrna isolation system . complementary dna was synthesized using oligo dt and superscripttm ii reverse transcriptase .

qpcrs were carried out in a  <dig> real-time pcr system . quantitation of each cdna was achieved using sybr green pcr master mix  in triplicate. primer sequences for housekeeping genes and m <dig> 3’utr were published elsewhere  <cit> . the oligonucleotide sequences used were: 5’agaaattccaacgcaactaacaaa3’ and 5’tgtttccaactggcaatgca3’, forward and reverse primers, respectively, for m6-a/c/d variants ; 5’tcactgtgtgccgtttagcttg3’ and 5’tttatggagtcgaagtcggaattt3’ forward and reverse primers, respectively, for the m6-b variant . normalization was accomplished using rp <dig> and gapdh as housekeeping genes and resulted in almost identical patterns. relative quantification was performed using a comparative ct method  <cit> . before each experiment, the calibration curves were validated. samples whose curves amplified out of the calibrated dynamic range were eliminated. all procedures followed the manufacturer’s instructions.

m <dig> transcripts identification, topology and motif predictions
pcr were done with gotaq® dna polymerase according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the oligonucleotide sequences used were: 5’aattcccaacgcaactaacaaattg3’ and 5’ctgtactccagctcgttcaggtt3’, forward and reverse primers for m6-a/c/d variants ; and 5’attcgttgctcggtggttattg3’ and 5’ctagaagcgatccttcga3’, forward and reverse primers for m6-b . the pcr amplicons were cloned into pgem®-t vector system  and sequenced. cdna sequences corresponding to novel m <dig> variants have been deposited in genbank  <cit> . ncbi accession numbers are as follows:  ,   and  . the forward and reverse primers annealing 38b downstream of the p <dig> site and 367b downstream of the stop codon were: 5’ttttgagcgaattcagttgg3’ and 5’gcattcggcaattcagaagaa3’, respectively.

bioinformatic analysis included the vector nti advance  <dig> software package, kalign  and clustalw  alignments  <cit> ; the ensembl website was used to determine exon/intron boundaries  <cit> . in addition, predict protein server  <cit> , which includes phd predictions for protein topology, prof predictions for motif scan  and disulfind for disulfide bridge prediction, were employed.

cloning and plasmids used
to obtain gfp::m6-a, gfp::m6-b, gfp::m6-c and gfp::m6-d plasmids, all cdnas were cloned into pgem®-t vector system  and subcloned into pegfp-c <dig> vector  with pfu dna polymerase  according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. primers were designed to amplify the complete coding sequences  from the initial atg to the stop codon. primers included the saci and kpni restriction recognition sites to allow in-frame cloning into the pegfp-c <dig> multiple cloning sites. oligonucleotide sequences used were: 5’gagctcaaatggcgttgtgaagtatg3’, 5’gagctcaaatgccgggcaaggggaacaa3’ and 5’gagctcaaatgggagaatgctgccaat3’, forward primers for m6-am6-b and m6-c/d, respectively; 5’ggtaccctagaagcgatccttcgaggt3’ and 5’ggtacctcatgtcctccagtttcgtgtt3’, reverse primers for m6-a/b/c and m6-d, respectively. after the cloning step, plasmids were sequenced to exclude mutations. control vectors, gfp::m6a  <cit>  expressed in the plasma membrane and gfp , which bind to plasma membrane phospholipds, were found to be enriched at the plasma membrane.

cell line and transfections
mouse neuroblastoma 2a  cells were cultured in dmem with 10-20 %  fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

for transfections, we used polyethylenimine . briefly, 2 μg of plasmid dna and 3 μl of 25 mm pei were diluted in 50 μl of protein and antibiotic free medium  and incubated for  <dig> minutes. next, 200 μl of complete medium were combined with transfection mix and added to each well in a  <dig> wells per plate format, containing cells previously washed twice with pbs . cells were incubated with the transfection mix for  <dig> hours at 37 °c. then, cells were washed  <dig> times with pbs and incubated with complete fresh medium.

cell staining and image analysis
twenty-four hours after transfection, n2a cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde/4 % sucrose in pbs for 15 min at 4 °c. for f-actin staining, permeabilization was carried out and stained with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> in pbs for 2 min. cultures were blocked with 3 % bsa in pbs for  <dig> hour, followed by incubation with the rhodamine phalloidin 1/ <dig>   in 3 % bsa in pbs at 37 °c for 1 hr. coverslips were incubated with dapi and then were mounted with fluorsave reagent . fluorescent images were acquired by using a nikon eclipse 80i microscope  equipped with coolled pe excitation system or a confocal laser scanning microscope .

the percentage of cells displaying filopodial protrusions  was calculated for both transfected as well as non-transfected cells from the same coverslip. the percentage of non-transfected cells bearing filopodia from the same coverslip was used to normalize data. the ratio of transfected to non-transfected filopodium-bearing cells from the same coverslip was determined. a ratio similar to one implies that filopodium formation was not induced. at least  <dig> cells per coverslip were analyzed for  <dig> replicates from each experiment. each experiment was independently repeated three times. images were processed using photoshop and illustrator .

whole brain immunohistochemistry and image analysis
adult brains from 3–6 day-old flies were dissected, fixed and stained as previously described  <cit> . briefly, heads were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in pb  for  <dig> minutes to  <dig> hour at room temperature. the brain was dissected and washed with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> in pbs . brains were then blocked in 7 % goat serum in pt for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibody in pt  for 48 h at 4 °c. washes were carried out in pt  for  <dig> minutes and repeated twice prior to the addition of the secondary antibody. after a 2 h incubation step, brains were washed for three times in pt , once in pt  and mounted in fluorsave reagent . all steps were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. the primary antibodies used were mouse anti-fasii , anti-elav , and rabbit anti-gfp . secondary antibodies conjugated to cy <dig> or cy <dig> were used . detection of gfp::m <dig> in the adult brain was repeated at least three times examining 8– <dig> brains in each experiment. brains from white flies were used as a negative control to confirm the specificity of the gfp antibody. fluorescent images were acquired with the laser scanning confocal microscope zeiss lsm <dig> meta using 20x/ <dig> , 40x/ <dig>  and 63x/ <dig>  objectives. images were processed using photoshop and illustrator .

lifespan analysis
survival was determined at 25 °c under ld conditions. one hundred male flies from each genotype were maintained in vials  containing standard medium. flies  were placed in vials and were scored for survivorship every 3–4 days, when they were transferred to fresh vials to minimize death caused by bacterial infection or moist in the medium. three independent experiments were carried out. survival curves represent the percentage of surviving flies as a function of time. for statistical analysis the mean life span of each strain was calculated as the time  at which survival reached 50 % of the starting population. in all experiments, only males were used because female life span is known to depend upon reproductive history  <cit> .

environmental scanning electron microscopy  of adult compound eyes
young adult male flies  were collected, anesthetized and immobilized on the esem mount using water-based colloidal carbon glue for proper orientation. the electroscan was performed with an environmental scanning electron microscope  at  <dig>  kv and  <dig>  torr in the auxiliary mode. this technology does not require metal coating of the specimen.

phototactic behavior
before each assay,  <dig> adult males of 2- to 3-days old were selected under co <dig> and allowed to recover in fresh food vials for 1–3 days in ld. phototactic behavior was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, a horizontal device allows the “collecting tubes” to slide through the one containing the flies at the beginning of the experiment, which is always kept in the same position in reference to the light source. at least 15 min before testing flies were transferred to darkness for adaptation; further manipulations were performed under a safe red light. flies were moved to a “test” tube . five “collecting” tubes were placed opposite to the test one. the white cold light source  was initially placed right behind the collecting tube  <dig>  and kept in line with the test tube throughout the experiment. each collecting tube was allowed to connect sequentially with the test tube for 1 min. thus, flies were allowed to freely move to the collecting illuminated tube for 1 min, and then the tube was moved to the next position. the number of flies in each  tube was counted, and the proportion of flies that had a positive phototactic response  was analyzed. in each experiment, the results were the mean of the scores from  <dig> trials recorded from  <dig> flies per genotype. each experiment was independently repeated  <dig> times.

total fly locomotor activity measurement
spontaneous fly locomotor activity of 2-3-days old adult males was monitored by recording infrared beam crossings in glass tubes  using a commercially available drosophila activity monitoring system . individual activity was scored under ld conditions for  <dig> consecutive days. total activity levels were determined as total counts per day displayed for each fly. statistical analysis included a kruskall-wallis test. data were obtained from at least three independent experiments; n =  <dig> flies per genotype in each experiment.

statistical data analysis
graphs were generated with graphpad prism software. statistical analysis was performed with is . group means were analyzed for overall statistical significance by one-way analysis of variance  followed by multiple comparison tests. non-parametric analysis was performed  when assumptions on the normal distribution and variance did not allow otherwise.

RESULTS
novel m <dig> variants are generated by alternative splicing
the m <dig> gene is located in 78d <dig> of chromosome 3 l. the complete m <dig> exon-intron structure comprises 4– <dig> exons, which span a genomic interval of  <dig>  kb. two depicted transcription initiation sites  give rise to four m <dig> mrna variants  and four predicted proteins that contain  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids .

early in the study, only isoforms m6-a  and m6-b  had been reported as transcript variants encoded by the m <dig> gene in the flybase  <cit> , with both transcripts producing apparently the same protein, m <dig> a-b . rt-pcr analysis of wild-type ovaries and heads with primers annealing to the end of isoforms m6-a or m6-b  resulted in the identification of two novel shorter m <dig> transcripts , as well as the expected m <dig> transcripts . sequence analysis indicated that shorter cdnas were novel variants expressed in d. melanogaster. the novel m <dig> transcripts, termed m6-c  and m6-d , are two variants derived from alternative splicing. both novel transcripts initiate at p <dig> and lack the first coding exon , thereby giving rise to an n-terminus shorter than the one in m6-a . the m6-c predicted protein has  <dig> aa. previous work reported sequences for m <dig> in drosophila  as m6- <dig>  and m6- <dig> . through sequence alignment, we determined that those sequences correspond to m6-c and m6-b isoforms, respectively, described in the present study . in addition, m6-d has  <dig> additional bases  resulting from retention of the last intron, which shifts the reading frame and creates a premature stop codon located  <dig> bases upstream of the m6-a stop codon . therefore, this m6-d variant is predicted to give rise to a shorter protein , with  <dig> novel aa at the c-terminus . in addition, there was a difference between the m6-a variant reported in the database  and the cloned variant from the present study . the new variant has  <dig> additional base pairs,  <dig> of which are within the first coding exon . therefore, the predicted protein has  <dig> aa, with an n-terminus slightly longer than m6-a reported in the database. additional primers were used to confirm these results , suggesting that the novel variants  contain the 5’utr corresponding to the p <dig> promoter and share the same 3’utr .

m <dig> is structurally conserved
using the ‘predict protein’ server  <cit>  and other bioinformatic tools, it was possible to predict the m <dig> tertiary structure. m <dig>  mammalian m6a, and other plp family members comprise four transmembrane domains , a minor  and a major  extracellular loop, one intracellular loop , and both n- and c- termini, which were localized within the cytoplasm. figure1c shows the comparison at the primary structure level between m6a  and m <dig>  isoforms. the similarity percentage between different domains of m6a and m <dig> is also noted. the tm domains, ec <dig>  ic, and c-terminal regions share a high similarity  between mouse and fly sequences.

in addition, alignment of all m <dig> isoforms revealed that m6-a, -b, and -c are identical, with exception of the n-terminal region. m6-a exhibits a longer n-terminus than m6-b, whereas m6-c and -d display a shorter one. variability at the n-terminal region is due to alternative initiation sites , as well as alternative splicing of the first coding exon . in contrast, m6-d lacks the last transmembrane domain. therefore, the c-terminus is localized outside the cell, which suggests that the major extracellular loop  does not adopt a proper conformation owing to the frame shift and premature stop codon.

we also sought for putative target sites for posttranslational modifications within the m <dig> sequence. the analysis revealed several conserved motives for phosphorylation  and phosphokinase c ), n-myristoylation, and key cysteine  residues. interestingly, these sites are conserved in mammalian m6a. predictive models of tertiary structures with sites conserved between mouse m6a and fly m <dig> are shown in figure1d. ec <dig> cys residues forming disulfide bonds essential for m6a function  <cit> , and two n-terminal cys residues, which are conserved in all plp family members of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms  <cit> , are present in most m <dig> isoforms . in particular, fly m <dig> and mouse m6a share three cys residues at the intracellular n-terminus. in contrast, the m6-d isoform lacks the third cys residue in ec <dig>  and a fourth cys residue appears in the frameshifted sequence. ck <dig> and pkc phosphorylation sites at the c-terminus  correspond with m6a phosphorylated s <dig> and s <dig> sites  <cit> , which could be crucial for m6a function  <cit> .

m <dig> is functionally conserved
because m <dig> isoforms are predicted to be transmembrane proteins  and m6a is localized to the plasma membrane  <cit> , localization of the various m <dig> variants was analyzed. m <dig> isoforms tagged to gfp were overexpressed in murine neuroblastoma 2a  cells, and localization was determined by confocal section analysis. similar to mammalian m6a , m6-a, -b, and -c exhibited cell surface expression . in contrast, m6-d, which lacks the fourth tm and ec <dig> domains, was mostly restricted to intracellular compartments .

mouse m6a has been shown to induce filopodium/spine formation in neural and non-neural cells  <cit> . therefore, to determine functional conservation of the distinct fly m <dig> variants, filopodium formation was analyzed. briefly, n2a mammalian cells were transfected with fly m <dig> isoforms or mouse gfp-m6a, as well as gfp alone as the control . the percentage of cells bearing filopodial protrusions was quantified for transfected, as well as non-transfected cells through visualization of the f-actin marker phalloidin. the ratio of transfected to non-transfected filopodium-bearing cells was calculated to measure variant-specific overexpression resulting in filopodium formation. gfp overexpression did not induce filopodium formation , whereas gfp::m6a overexpression exhibited significant induction . overexpression of m6-a, -b and -c isoforms induced filopodium formation similar to mammalian m6a, which significantly varied from gfp alone . in contrast, m6-d, the truncated isoform lacking the major extracellular loop  and the fourth tm domain , did not induce filopodium formation . these results suggest that m6-a, -b, and -c are functionally conserved variants. in addition, altered protein structure was likely responsible for m6-d subcellular delocalization and subsequent functional loss. these results suggest that the novel m6-d variant encodes a non-functional isoform.

m <dig> isoforms are differentially expressed
because m6a is highly expressed in the mammalian nervous system, m <dig> mrna expression was analyzed in drosophila heads. using qpcr, we observed prominent expression in the heads compared with m <dig> ovary expression . subsequently, we specifically quantified mrnas produced by either p <dig> or p <dig> promoters in wild-type heads and ovaries  using primers that annealed to the corresponding 5’utr . the m6-b transcript from p <dig> was expressed at similar levels in both samples. however, a predominance of p1-derived transcripts  was detected in the heads. these results reveal tissue-specificity in the m <dig> promoters, where p1-derived transcripts are most abundantly expressed in fly heads.

m <dig> localizes to several brain structures and neural projections
antibodies specific to m <dig> were generated to determine whether m <dig> protein was expressed in the d. melanogaster nervous system. however, the results were inconclusive. therefore, we used the fly line m6gfp, which reports endogenous levels of m <dig>  our previous results demonstrated that m <dig> mrna levels in m6gfp are not reduced compared with control flies, and only p1-specific isoforms were tagged in frame to gfp at the n-terminus  <cit> . immunofluorescence images of whole-mount brains of young adult flies are shown in figure3b-e. distinct neuropils were identified with antibodies specific to fasii . in addition, antibodies specific to elav, a neuronal-specific marker, served as the counterstain . in m6gfp, a general staining of the major brain centers at the protocerebrum  was observed. in fact, gfp::m <dig> was expressed in most mushroom body structures . in addition, gfp::m <dig> was expressed in the central body complex, more precisely in the ellipsoid body, superior arch, fan-shaped body, noduli, and the protocerebral bridge . other regions of the protocerebrum, such as the lateral horn, superior medial protocerebrum, ventrolateral protocerebrum, and superior lateral protocerebrum exhibited m <dig> expression .

in addition, neuropils most predominantly expressing gfp were present in the visual system  . interestingly, although entire neuropils were labeled, specific neural projections within the optic lobe that projected to the central brain, medulla, calyx, and protocerebral bridge were also labeled . gfp::m <dig> localization in several neuropils and in the cortical neuronal cell layer at the brain surface , as well as elav localization, further supported m <dig> neuronal expression.

m <dig> downregulation reduces lifespan
to determine the role of m <dig> in drosophila lifespan, potential m <dig> mutants containing inserted transposons within the m <dig> locus  were characterized. m <dig> flies contain a p-element inserted into the first exon , which corresponds to the 5’utr of m6-a-c, and -d transcripts, while m <dig> contains a different p-element within the first intron. our group previously demonstrated that m601/ <dig> flies are hypomorphic mutants  <cit> . in the present study, the role of m <dig> in fly survival was evaluated under normal conditions. the lifespan of m <dig> hypomorphic mutants was compared with that of homozygous m <dig>  heterozygous m <dig>  and w  flies. the male flies did not exhibit any change in maximal lifespan . however, when we examined the median lifespan, a parameter that indicates the time in which half of the population has died, significant differences were observed. while m602/ <dig> flies behaved similarly to control flies, a significantly reduced median lifespan was detected in homozygous m <dig> males compared with both controls . because the m <dig> flies were backcrossed  <dig> times to w flies to homogenize the genetic background, we conclude that the observed reduction in lifespan is indeed due to reduced m <dig> expression.

this finding opens the provocative possibility that m <dig> might play a role in regulating animal aging .

reduced m <dig> levels result in mild defects in the adult eye structure
m <dig> expression was measured in fly heads of control and m <dig> mutants . in addition to lines previously described, a transheterozygous m601/ <dig> line was included in the analysis. the m <dig> line has a p-element insertion in the last coding exon  of all functional variants and was determined to be homozygous lethal at the embryonic stage . heterozygous m <dig> and m602/ <dig> flies exhibited m <dig> mrna levels similar to the w control. in contrast, homozygous m <dig> and transheterozygous m601/ <dig> flies exhibited significantly reduced m <dig> mrna levels compared with control flies . in addition, in the p-excised m6Δ01-rev flies, m <dig> was restored to normal levels, suggesting that the p-element insertion in m <dig> reduced m <dig> expression in the heads.

characterization of the m <dig> mutants revealed morphological alterations in homozygous m <dig> eyes, which suggested that m <dig> might play a role in this structure. to evaluate m <dig> participation in eye development, adult eyes were examined by environmental scanning electron microscopy . the control flies, w and heterozygous m <dig>  exhibited a stereotypical, uniform, ommatidium pattern . in contrast, in the m <dig> hypomorphic mutants , a mild rough-eye phenotype was observed, as well as a disorganized ommatidium array, defects in ommatidium shape and/or ommatidium fusion , and defective or missing bristles . in addition, approximately 20 % of m601/ <dig> transheterozygote eyes exhibited an excessive interommatidial space . these results suggest that m <dig> plays a role during eye development .

m <dig> is required for light response
m <dig> is prominently expressed in the optic lobe, which suggests that m <dig> might play a role in the visual system, in particular in response to light. therefore, a phototaxis paradigm was used to detect and process light information. wild-type adult flies exhibit positive phototactic behavior. because w flies do not have pigmented eyes, the m602/ <dig> and m601/+ flies were used as controls to account for the potential contribution of eye pigmentation. although there were subtle differences between m601/ <dig> phototactic responses, the m601/ <dig> and m601/ <dig> young males exhibited a significantly defective response compared with controls , thereby suggesting that m <dig> is required for normal responses to light. although m <dig> mrna levels were similarly reduced in m601/ <dig> and m601/ <dig> mutants, the phenotypic consequences were greater in m601/ <dig>  although the exact nature of this difference remains to be determined, it is worth mentioning that the p-element in m <dig> only affects a subset of splice variants , while the p-element in m <dig> is inserted in a region common to all functional variants , likely affecting all isoforms. our results suggest that the differences in phototactic response could be a result of differential m <dig> variant expression in each specific mutant.

to rule out that the defective response to light induced by m <dig> downregulation was due to a general decrease in locomotor activity, adult m <dig> mutant flies were analyzed in drosophila activity monitors . interestingly, m601/ <dig> and m601/ <dig> males did not exhibit significant differences compared with control flies . therefore, the impaired light responsiveness was more likely derived from higher-order visual processing defects triggered by m <dig> downregulation.

discussion
results from the present study demonstrate that drosophila m <dig> is expressed in the fly nervous system. in addition, we identified two novel isoforms and further described the molecular organization of the m <dig> gene. the expression of most isoforms in neuroblastoma cells resulted in protrusions similar to those previously reported for mouse m6a, which suggests that m <dig> constitute the functional ortholog of mammalian m6a. in addition, analyses of insertional mutants demonstrated that m <dig> is required for a proper adult phototactic response.

structural conservation of plp family members
the generation of transcript variants by distinct promoters and alternative splicing seems to be a common feature in plp family member genes conserved through evolution. similar to drosophila m <dig> organization, zebrafish dmβ <dig> and rat gpm6a  exhibit 5’utr alternative splicing that produces two n-termini  <cit> . the human gpm6a gene exhibits three transcripts  that differ at the n-terminus owing to specific transcriptional start sites and/or alternative splicing in the first coding exon. similar features have been described for other members of the plp family, such as m6b and plp- <dig> <cit> . in the present molecular analysis of drosophila m <dig>  we have identified two novel m <dig> isoforms with a short n-terminus , as well as a third isoform  with a longer n-terminus compared with those reported in the database. the m <dig> isoform variation at the n-terminus is also due to alternative transcription start sites and alternative splicing of the first coding exon . since m <dig> is the only plp family member in drosophila, we propose that the splice variants may tailor m <dig> according to specific needs of each tissue. in the case of drosophila, we demonstrated that isoform expression is tissue-regulated by differential promoter activity . similarly, cooper et al.  demonstrated tissue-regulated gpm6a expression in the rat; ia and ib variants from alternative promoters are differentially expressed in the brain and kidney.

functional conservation of plp family members
results from the present study demonstrate that m6-a, -b, and -c proteins localize to the cell surface in neuroblastoma cells. as previously shown for mouse m6a  <cit> , all of them induced filopodium formation, demonstrating that m <dig> and m6a are indeed functional homologs. interestingly, we also detected a non-functional isoform  that was mostly restricted to the cytoplasm. m6-d lacks the third cys residue from the ec <dig> domain, as well as the fourth tm domain. previous work from our group on the mouse m6a shows that the first and fourth cys residues  are crucial for cell surface expression and for m6a function  <cit> . in the case of fly m6-d, the absence of the last tm may prevent proper ec <dig> folding, resulting in a defective interaction between the first and fourth cys, thus leading to altered subcellular localization and impaired filopodium formation. consistent with fuchsova et al. , the ec <dig> domain structure appeared to be necessary for proper protein localization and function. in addition, plp mutants lacking cys residues from ec <dig> are misfolded and, therefore, are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . interestingly, because m6-d is endogenously expressed in ovaries and heads , it is possible that it might act as an endogenous regulator. intriguingly, m <dig> expression is regulated by nonsense-mediated mrna decay , which is a post-transcriptional regulation mechanism that targets transcripts containing early stop codons  <cit> . the m6-a transcript is an nmd-target, whereas m6-b is not  <cit> . because m6-a and m6-d transcripts share the 5’utr sequence, it is possible that m6-d also undergoes degradation via the nmd pathway.

m <dig> functions in the visual system
m <dig> was predominantly expressed in the fly adult optic lobe . in the mouse, m6a is present in neuronal processes of the retina, including axons of retinal ganglion cells during development, and inner and outer plexiform layers of adult retina. in addition, m6a overexpression in retinal cells enhances neurite outgrowth in vitro <cit> . in xenopus and zebrafish, m6a is expressed in the retina, in particular in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer  <cit> . considering that the vertebrate and fly visual system share structural and functional molecular mechanisms, as well as developmental features  <cit> , we conclude that m6a/m6/dmb localization in the visual system is conserved through evolution.

despite previous reports of retinal m6a expression  <cit> , in vivo m6a function in the visual system has not been described. the present study provides the first experimental evidence for the requirement of m <dig> in the adult response to light . interestingly, although m <dig> hypomorphic mutations resulted in a subtly altered eye structure in the adult , m <dig> mutants exhibited very poor behavioral performance in a simple paradigm. these results suggest that m <dig> might play a role in higher-order visual processing, because structural alterations do not account for the defective light response. indeed, immunofluorescence analysis of chaoptin localization  in m <dig> mutant retinas did not exhibit any clear defect . however, this observation does not preclude a role for m <dig> in retinal morphogenesis. in fact, directing m6-rnai expression to the eye  resulted in clear structural defects . these results suggest a functional role for m <dig> in the establishment of the neural circuitry underlying visual processing.

the compound eye develops from a single-layered epithelium, the eye imaginal disc. pupal eye development involves a coordinated series of morphogenetic events, such as cell-cell communication, differential cell adhesion, maintenance of cell polarity, cell shape, local cell movement, and programmed cell death, to properly pattern the ommatidia in the adult eye  <cit> . accordingly, we previously reported a role for m <dig> in maintenance of the follicular epithelia, likely via cell adhesion, during cell remodeling  <cit> , which was further supported by the observation of abnormal de-cadherin distribution in the follicular epithelia of late egg chambers in m <dig> hypomorphic mutants . beta-integrin  and m <dig> genetically interacted, which was supported by fly lethality when m <dig> and mys <dig> alleles were combined . recently, our group demonstrated m6a localization in membrane microdomains, which are compatible with lipid rafts in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures  <cit> . interestingly, misexpression of the reggie/flotilin lipid raft markers in the fly eye imaginal disc results in severe disturbance of the ommatidial pattern and specific and severe mislocalization of cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . these results suggest a role for m <dig> in cell-adhesion during eye development.

according to differential tissue expression of transcripts in flies, each variant might play distinct roles in different tissues. therefore, m <dig> might play a dual role in cell remodeling in the visual system  and epithelia  <cit> .

m <dig> functions in drosophila
in addition to the requirements of m <dig> during fly development  <cit> , we demonstrated the role of m <dig> in adult survival. because the median life span of hypomorphic m <dig> males was slightly reduced, results suggest that m <dig> could also play a role in the regulation of animal aging.

m <dig> is expressed in several fly neuropils , including the central complex, a region involved in control of fly locomotion  <cit> . in addition, preliminary results showed that overall locomotor activity was slightly, although significantly, reduced  in adult flies with silenced m <dig> expression specifically in the ellipsoid body  via a specific driver , suggesting that m <dig> could be required in neural circuits underlying this behavior. notably, plp mutant mice exhibit deficits in locomotor activity  <cit> . our results also showed m <dig> expression in mushroom bodies. the mushroom bodies are analogous to the mammalian hippocampus, where m6a is abundantly expressed and regulated by chronic stress  <cit> . in flies, the mushroom bodies are crucial for olfactory learning and memory. therefore, future studies should evaluate the role of m <dig> in this complex behavior.

similarly, it has been reported that m6a expression in the adult brain is stronger in non-myelinated axonal fibers compared with myelinated axons  <cit> . because proteolipid genes appeared earlier in evolution than myelin, it has been hypothesized that their involvement in myelination was acquired later  <cit> . consistent with this, the present study did not detect myelinated axons in drosophila. in flies, nerve ensheathment depends on axonal insulation by glial cells, as well as the subsequent establishment of septate junctions between glial cell membranes. it is worth mentioning that cell junction organization and function share common features in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . therefore, m6a/m <dig> could potentially act as a mediator of cell-cell interactions involved in axon fasciculation during development. this possibility is also supported by the observation that in the drosophila embryo, m <dig> co-localizes with fasciclin ii, a marker of longitudinal axon fascicles in the nervous system  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have revealed tissue-differential expression of novel m <dig> isoforms, one of which was non-functional. m <dig> was shown to be the functional fly ortholog of gpm6a. in addition, a role for m <dig> in the regulation of life span and in the in vivo fly visual system was revealed, which is particularly relevant owing to conservation of this protein between flies and mammals.
