BACKGROUND
conventional gene knockout  technologies such as loxp/cre-mediated conditional gene ko  are widely used for discovering gene functions. a key limitation of these methods is that the ko is irreversible. it is therefore impossible to determine if, for example, the malignancies and neurological disorders reported in p <dig> and mecp <dig> ko mice, respectively, can be cured by restoring gene functions, a question of obvious clinical relevance. because the ko in the original mouse models is not reversible, special strains have to be generated to address these questions, which entails substantial amounts of work  <cit> . reversible ko would also be invaluable for studying epigenetic programming, a central issue in developmental biology. specifically, during lineage development, transient action of environmental cues is thought to irreversibly modify  the epigenetic states of target genes in the developing cells, such that the altered epigenetic states can persist and be propagated to mature progeny cells without the continuous presence of the initiating cues  <cit> . defining the role of a gene in developmental programming requires deleting the gene in immature cells and analyzing the resultant defects in mature cells, but the gene controlling developmental programming may also be expressed and functioning in mature cells, which complicates data interpretation, given that conventional ko strategy is not reversible. for example, deleting the chromatin-remodeling factor mi-2b in immature t cells impairs proliferation of mature t cells  <cit> , but because mi-2b is expressed not only in immature but also in mature t cells, it is unclear if the proliferation defect reflects a developmental role of mi-2b. the only way to directly address such an issue is to eliminate the protein in immature cells. and then restore its expression in mature cells.

multiple methods have been devised to achieve reversible gene regulation, but each has limitations. in one method, endogenous genes are modified so that their expression is now driven by tetracycline-regulated artificial transcription activators expressed from the endogenous regulatory elements, thus allowing for reversible gene regulation, but it is difficult to recapitulate the expression levels of the endogenous genes with the synthetic activators  <cit> . in an alternative method, tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer , a tetracycline-regulated transcription repressor, has been successfully used to reversibly inhibit the expression of hoxa <dig> and htr1a, but whether this method is generally applicable to other genes remains unclear, and furthermore, the only tts transgenic line currently available expresses tts in various tissues, and is hence unsuitable for tissue-specific inhibition. regulated expression of small hairpin rna has also been used for reversible gene repression, but the repression is usually incomplete  <cit> . finally, transcription stop sequences or gene-trap cassettes, which are removable/inactivable, can be inserted into target genes, leading to constitutive ko that can be conditionally rescued, but this strategy is not suitable for conditional induction of gene ko  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe a straightforward and robust method for reversible cko without these limitations. the method, which we dub loft , combines cko with gene trapping, a well-established method for insertional mutagenesis  <cit> . in its simplest form, a gene-trap cassette consists of a promoterless selectable marker flanked by a splice acceptor  and a polyadenylation  sequence. when inserted into an intron of an expressed gene, the sa captures the upstream exon while the pa sequence truncates the transcript, thus producing a fusion protein between the n-terminus of the trapped protein and the selectable marker. thus, gene traps simultaneously inactivate and report the expression of the trapped gene. gene trapping can be made conditional by flanking gene-trap modules with loxp/frt sites  <cit> . loft combines cre-catalyzed cko with flp-catalyzed reversible trapping to achieve reversible cko. loft can also be used to create conventional ko mice. we report a proof-of-concept study using the gene encoding brg/brahma-associated factor  <dig>  a subunit of the chromatin-remodeling baf complex.

the baf complex, a prototypical mammalian atp-dependent chromatin remodeler complex , is widely expressed, and plays diverse, often tissue-specific roles in gene regulation  <cit> . although called atp-dependent crc, the complex can also regulate target genes without using the classic atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity  <cit> . indeed, although the complex consists of more than ten subunits, a group of four core subunits, including the catalytic subunit brahma-related gene  <dig>  is fully sufficient to reconstitute atp-dependent chromatin-remodeling in vitro  <cit> . the functions of the remaining accessory subunits are poorly understood, but may contribute to the atp-independent functions of the baf complex and/or modulate the classic remodeling activity of the baf complex. the  <dig> kda high mobility group  protein baf <dig>  related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily e member 1) is the first known accessory subunit  <cit> . baf <dig> is important for t -cell development in mice  <cit> , and for regulating apoptosis  <cit> , the cell cycle  <cit>  and functions of the androgen and estrogen receptors  <cit>  in tumor lines. furthermore, baf <dig> is strongly expressed in human endometrial carcinoma, and serves as a marker of poor prognosis  <cit> .

we are interested in further studying the roles of baf <dig> in t- cell development in the thymus, which is arguably the best-defined ontogenetic system in vertebrates  <cit> . the earliest thymocytes are double-negative  cells lacking the antigen coreceptor cd <dig> or cd <dig>  these cells undergo extensive proliferation, and express both cd <dig> and cd <dig> to become double-positive  cells. dp cells bifurcate into cd <dig> helper and cd <dig> cytotoxic cells, the two major subsets of t lymphocytes in the adaptive immune system, which are marked by cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression, respectively. we previously explored the role of baf <dig> in t cells using a baf <dig> dominant-negative mutant. baf <dig> is a protein of  <dig> amino acids  consisting of several conserved domains, including the n-terminal proline-rich domain  with unknown functions, the hmg domain  that binds dna, a domain rich in asp, his, leu and ile , and the c-terminal domain rich in acidic residues  <cit> . the functions of these domains are unknown except for the dna-binding of the hmg domain  <cit> . we found that thymocyte-specific expression of a dominant-negative mutant of baf <dig> lacking the n-terminal  <dig> aa including the hmg causes reciprocal cd4/cd <dig> misregulation during t-cell development, but the mutant does not significantly impair production or function of mature t cells  <cit> . because the dominant-negative mutation impairs only a specific aspect of baf <dig> function, the roles of baf <dig> in t cells remain incompletely understood. in particular, it is unclear if baf <dig>  acting in thymocytes, can epigenetically program the function of mature t cells. this problem motivated us to develop the reversible cko method loft.

RESULTS
loft: basic rationale
cko followed by conditional restoration of gene expression is achieved with a pair of alleles of a target gene: a floxed allele and a reversibly trapped allele that is a null by default but can be conditionally converted to a wild-type  allele. the latter allele is designated Δr, where r denotes 'reversible' . the key component of the Δr allele is a gene-trap cassette consisting of the neomycin phosphotransferase  and an ires-green fluorescent protein  construct. this cassette is inserted into an intron, thus capturing the upstream exon to produce a fusion protein between the n-terminus of the target protein and the neomycin phosphotransferase, the former moiety being inactive, and the latter serving as the selection marker for successfully targeted embryonic stem  cells if the target gene is expressed in those cells. in addition, gfp is co-expressed with the fusion protein, which reports the expression pattern of the target gene. importantly, the gene-trapping cassette is flanked by flp recombination target  sites, allowing for conditional excision of the cassette in the presence of active flp. the removal of the gene-trapping cassette restores the expression of full-length protein, concomitant with the loss of gfp expression. the floxed and Δr alleles can be used separately to achieve conditional and constitutive gene ko, respectively, but in combination, they allow for reversible cko: in mice bearing both alleles and also expressing conditional cre and flp, sequential function of the two enzymes will lead to target gene knockout followed by restoration of its expression, and this process can be monitored by the loss of gfp expression . the construct depicted in figure  <dig> is not suitable for genes not expressed in es cells. in such cases, one may delete the neo-ires sequence in the vector and insert a neo expression cassette  between gfp-pa sequence and the 3' frt, thus turning the promoter-trapping vector into a simple conventional knock-in construct. of note, although the major application of loft is likely to be reversible cko, variations of the theme are readily conceivable. for example, if excision of the floxed sequence leads to the production of a deletion mutant rather than to elimination of the entire protein, then loft may be used to reverse the effects of such hypomorphic mutations, as described below.

generation of baf57f and baf57Δr
our goal was to study the potential roles of baf <dig> in developmental programming of t cells, which required deleting baf <dig> in immature t cells, followed by the reversal of the ko in mature t cells. because our previous studies involving brg <dig> suggests that complete elimination of baf <dig> might block t-cell development and make the experiment unfeasible  <cit> , we sought to reduce rather than eliminate baf <dig> expression. to this end, we floxed exons  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode the first  <dig> residues of baf <dig>  and named the resulting allele baf57f . deleting the two exons would be expected to cause expression of a truncated baf <dig> protein that starts with a methionine encoded by an atg in exon  <dig>  because the atg in exon  <dig> is not embedded in the kozak consensus sequence, the mutant should be expressed at lower levels than the wt. in addition, the residual protein might not be fully active, given that it lacks the bulk of the conserved proline-rich domain. thus, we would expect baf57f to be a conditional hypomorphic allele.

baf57f and baf57Δr were generated with a single targeting vector by exploiting crossing-over site variability during homologous recombination   <cit> . to facilitate the generation of baf57Δr lacking the 5' loxp site, we used a short  left arm upstream of the 5' loxp site. this was used to ensure that during homologous recombination between the left arm and the endogenous sequence, the crossing over could take place not only upstream of the 5' loxp site, leading to its incorporation into the endogenous gene, but also downstream of the loxp site, preventing its incorporation. the targeted allele retaining the 5' loxp site  can be converted to baf57f after flp-mediated excision of the gene-trap cassette from the germline, whereas the allele lacking the 5' loxp site is cre-resistant and acts as baf57Δr.

we recovered both baf57int and baf57Δr after screening only  <dig> es cell clones, confirming that the targeting method, called 'targeted trapping'  <cit> , is extremely efficient . of note, only one of the five correctly targeted clones carried the 5' loxp site; this frequency could perhaps be increased by lengthening the  <dig>  kb left arm upstream of the loxp site. we then generated baf57int/+ and baf57Δr/+ mice using standard methods. the heterozygous pups were born at normal mendelian ratios, but homozygous pups were absent, indicating embryonic lethality. both strains widely expressed gfp, with the gfp expression in t cells in baf57int/+ mice abolishable by cd4-cre, indicating that baf57int is useful for reporting cre activity . finally, we generated baf57f by deleting the gene-trap cassette in baf57int using a line ubiquitously expressing flpe.

characterization of baf57f and baf57Δr
we first examined baf57f/+; cd4-cre mice carrying the cd4-cre transgene that directs cre expression in cd4+ t cells   <cit> . pcr analysis confirmed that the floxed sequence was effectively deleted from thymocytes . to determine the status of the baf <dig> protein, we performed western blotting using an antibody against the c-terminus of baf <dig>  in both the thymocytes and cd <dig> cells from baf57f/+; cd4-cre mice, cre-mediated deletion led to the emergence of three truncation mutants of baf <dig> that were much less abundant than wt baf <dig> . the mutants seemed upregulated in baf57f/f; cd4-cre thymocytes where both copies of baf57f were subject to deletion . of note, a low level of wt baf <dig> persisted in total thymocytes from these mice, which presumably came from the dn subset lacking cre expression. we next examined baf57Δr, alone and in combination with baf57f. as expected, baf57Δr did not express a mutant protein detectable by the antibody , whereas the baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre thymocytes harbored the three truncation mutants, as well as a trace amount of wt baf <dig> that was less abundant than in baf57f/f; cd4-cre mice . finally, mature cd <dig> cells from baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre mice also expressed the three truncation mutants, but wt baf <dig> was absent in these cells, indicating complete deletion of the floxed allele . there was no gross defect in the development or function of t cells in any of the mice described above .

to determine whether baf57Δr could be conditionally activated through deletion of the gene-trap cassette, we used the r26flpoer <dig> deleter strain that ubiquitously expresses flpoer <dig> from the rosa <dig> locus  <cit> . flpoer <dig> is a fusion between the codon-optimized flp called flpo  <cit>  and the modified estrogen receptor , ert <dig>  which retains the recombinase in the cytosol until tamoxifen  administration  <cit> , with a linker sequence derived from cre-er inserted between the flpo and ert <dig>  in mice carrying baf57Δr and expressing flpoer <dig>  tam injection therefore would induce nuclear translocation of flpoer <dig> to cause deletion of the gene-trap cassette and hence activation of the baf57Δr. to determine the ability of flpoer <dig> to activate baf57Δr, we introduced r26flpoer <dig> into baf57f/Δr mice. we injected tam once a day for  <dig> consecutive days, and monitored gfp expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes. before tam injection, gfp was uniformly expressed in cd <dig>  cd <dig> and b cells . cells losing gfp emerged  <dig> days after the first tam injection, and comprised around 50% of total lymphocytes on day  <dig>  when the gfp signals in the affected cells were reduced by about 4-fold . because the gfp half-life is ~ <dig> hours and the peripheral lymphocytes are mostly resting, deletion of the gene-trap cassette in our mice seemed to occur predominantly around day  <dig> after the first tam injection. a similar observation was made in a baf57f/Δr ; cd4-cre; r26flpoer <dig> mouse, except that on day  <dig>  only about 30% of the lymphocytes had deleted the gene-trap cassette . the variation in the deletion efficiency was stochastic and not correlated with genotype; on average, the deletion efficiencies at day  <dig> were  <dig> ± 8%,  <dig> ± 7%, and  <dig> ± 8% in cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and b lymphocytes, respectively . we sorted gfp+ and gfplow/- cells from baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre; r26flpoer <dig> mice, and performed western blotting. as expected, the gfp+ cells expressed only the three truncation mutants and no wt baf <dig> protein , and importantly, wt baf <dig> was restored in gfplow/- cells, showing that baf57Δr can indeed be converted into the wt allele .

we next sought to determine the identities of the three mutants expressed by baf57f after cre-mediated deletion of exons  <dig> to  <dig>  hereafter). as mentioned before, baf57Δ is expected to direct the expression of the baf <dig> mutant that lacks the first  <dig> residues and hence is about  <dig> kda smaller than the wt protein, which might account for one of these three mutants, as the molecular weights of these mutants seemed to differ from the wt protein by less than  <dig> kda. the other two mutants might be its degradation products, and/or be expressed from aberrantly spliced transcripts. to address this, we performed reverse transcriptase -pcr using primers targeting exons  <dig> and  <dig>  the primers amplified a single product of  <dig> bp in wt cd <dig> cells as expected, but produced two smaller bands from baf57f/Δr ; cd4-cre mice . rt-pcr using primers targeting exons  <dig> and  <dig> suggested that the top and bottom bands in the mutant cells represented the predicted transcript  and an aberrant transcript with exon  <dig> joined to exon  <dig>  respectively , which was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplicons . interestingly, exon  <dig> was also found to harbor an in-frame atg, suggesting that the aberrantly spliced transcript can be translated into a deletion mutant lacking the n-terminal  <dig> aa  and hence is about  <dig> kda smaller than wt protein. perhaps this mutant was running aberrantly slowly to constitute one of three mutant bands. of note, as in the case of the atg in exon  <dig>  the atg in exon  <dig> is not embedded in the kozak consensus sequence, consistent with their low expression levels compared with the wt protein. thus, at least two of the three mutant proteins might result from translation of spliced transcripts. indeed, multiple alternatively spliced transcripts, two of them predicted to direct the expression of the mutant proteins lacking the n-terminal  <dig> and  <dig> aa, normally exist in the brain  <cit> . however, direct sequencing of these bands is needed to confirm this hypothesis, particularly because of the unusual mobility of baf <dig>  whose predicted molecular weight is  <dig> kda but whose apparent molecular weight ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> kda, depending on the gel system used.

finally, as alluded to before, although the three mutant proteins were expressed, as expected, only at very low levels in the cells that also expressed wt protein, they accumulated in the cells lacking the wt protein, which occurred both in the thymus  and the mature cd <dig> cells . this upregulation of the mutant proteins in the absence of wt baf <dig> presumably reflected a post-translational regulatory mechanism seeking to maintain stoichiometric abundance of various baf subunits  <cit> . as the mutant proteins are at least partially active, their accumulation may help explain why deletion of the floxed exons in baf57f had no major biological effect. however, because the mutants presumably lacked the intact n-terminus, their accumulation might recapitulate, to some extent, the phenotype seen in mice overexpressing a baf <dig> dominant-negative mutant lacking the n-terminal  <dig> aa, and more importantly, this defect may be prevented by tam treatment. this is indeed the case, as described below.

phenotype caused by baf <dig> mutations and its prevention by tam injection
a major defect caused by overexpressing the baf <dig> mutant lacking the n-terminal  <dig> aa is the dramatically impaired cd <dig> expression in early dp cells, which is found in the large thymocyte blasts lacking t-cell receptor , cd <dig> or cd <dig> expression   <cit> . in control mice, this early thymocyte population comprised mostly  dp cells and no cd4+cd8low/- cells, the latter being the hallmark of impaired cd <dig> expression . heterozygous deletion of the floxed exons in baf <dig> had little effect , whereas homozygous deletion  led to significant accumulation of cd4+cd8low/- cells, which made up 17% of the early thymocyte population , although the effect was two-fold weaker than in previously reported baf <dig> dominant-negative mice containing 34% of the cd4+cd8low/- cells  <cit> . interestingly, a single copy of baf57Δr was sufficient to cause a mild defect in cd <dig> expression  whereas a single copy of baf57Δ was not , despite the fact that baf57Δ was expressed at very low levels if at all . the cause of this discrepancy is unclear but we have excluded gfp expression in the former mice as a potential mechanism . finally, as expected, baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre mice also had a significant defect in cd <dig> expression . another major defect caused by overexpressing the baf <dig> mutant lacking the n-terminal  <dig> aa is premature cd <dig> de-repression in dn cells  <cit> . no such defect was seen in baf57f/f; cd4-cre mice, as predicted from the cre expression pattern, and neither could baf57Δr cause this defect, indicating that baf <dig> is haplosufficient for cd <dig> repression in dn cells .

the fact that baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre mice showed a significant defect in cd <dig> expression set the stage for testing the effect of tam on the phenotype. given the rapidity of early t-cell development and the relatively slow kinetics of baf57Δr activation, it is unfeasible for tam to 'cure' the pre-existing phenotype in early dp cells that exist only transiently, but tam might be able to activate baf57Δr in the precursors of these transient cells to prevent the subsequent defective cd <dig> expression in early dp cells. to test this, we used baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre; r26flpoer <dig> and baf57f/Δr; r26flpoer <dig> mice, the latter included because baf57Δr alone sufficed to produce a detectable, albeit weak, defect in cd <dig> expression. the mice were exposed to tam as described above. unexpectedly, on day  <dig> after the initial tam injection, only about 5% of the early thymocytes had lost gfp expression , and the same was true for later thymocytes , in contrast to the approximately 37% deletion efficiency in peripheral lymphocytes, thus revealing substantial tissue-specificity in the deletion efficiency in our system. we then examined early dp cells showing or lacking gfp expression. as expected, in cells expressing gfp, cd <dig> expression was impaired, with the cd4+cd8low/- population comprising about 10% and 25% of the early thymocytes in baf57f/; r26flpoer1and baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre; r26flpoer <dig> mice, respectively . importantly, the cd4+cd8low/- population was absent in the gfp- compartment, demonstrating successful prevention of the phenotype . this effect was dependent on r26flpoer <dig>  and thus not an artifact resulting from elimination of gfp .

discussion
strengths and limitations of loft
loft combines pre-existing basic genetic methods into a straightforward and reliable reversible gene-targeting method. the method is reliable because its two components, cre-mediated conditional gene targeting and flp-mediated reversible gene trapping, are both well established. it is also simple because the pair of alleles involved can typically be generated with a single construct. furthermore, for the genes whose floxed alleles are already available, only the trapped alleles are needed to convert the pre-existing cko into reversible cko, which simplifies the method. this is an important advantage because floxed alleles for the majority of mouse genes will become available in the future thanks to concerted efforts in several countries  <cit> . loft is also flexible, because the two alleles can be used independently for conventional gene targeting, and what is more, the 'intermediate allele' generated can serve as a gfp reporter of cre activities. loft does require cre and flp-deleter lines, but this should not pose a problem because numerous cre lines are already available, as is a mouse line ubiquitously expressing a version of flpoer that is far more effective than the one  used in the current study; the two versions are identical except for the linker sequence between flpo and er  <cit> . finally, loft, whose major application is likely to be reversible cko, can have other applications such as reversal of hypomorphic alleles, as we have shown. as another application, point mutations may be introduced into the trapped genes to dissect their functions, which is analogous to the approach for producing conditional point mutant mice that we previously developed  <cit> , except that in the previous method, the point mutant is expressed concurrently with the loss of the wt protein, whereas in the loft method, the two events can happen sequentially. the sequential occurrence would be essential in addressing, for example,, the mode of action of p <dig>  specifically, ko of the p <dig> gene is known to cause tumors, which can be suppressed by restoration of p <dig> expression  <cit> . surprising, it was recently found that a p <dig> point mutant unable to induce apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, or senescence retained the ability to prevent tumorigenesis, presumably as a result of the ability of the mutant protein to regulate energy metabolism and production of reactive oxygen species  <cit> . whether the mutant can also suppress pre-existing tumors is unclear, and this important question is readily addressable by expressing the mutant protein in p <dig> cko mice. in summary, loft is a straightforward, reliable, simple, and flexible method for both reversible and conventional  gene targeting, and is readily adaptable for other applications.

however, there are several limitations to loft. first, the method involves a pair of alleles with the corresponding pair of recombinases, thus entailing significant amounts of breeding. second, the trapped allele is null by default, and so the gene needs to be haplosufficient for mouse survival. third, the method is not suitable for reversing the effect of deletion of regulatory elements such as enhancers or silencers. fourth, because loft works by combining cre/lox and gene-trapping systems, any limitation in these basic genetic methods would apply to loft. for example, as mentioned above, if the target gene is not expressed in es cells, then 'targeted trapping' is not applicable, and conventional methods, which have much lower efficiency, must be used  <cit> . fortunately, over 65% of all protein-coding genes in the mouse genome are amenable for promoter trapping in es cells  <cit> , and the efficiency can be raised to 85% if the binding sites  for a transcription factor expressed in es cells  are engineered into the vector  <cit> . thus, inefficient conventional methods should be reserved for only around  <dig> to 35% of protein-coding genes. because conventional methods are well established, we do not expect unusual problems in their application to our setting. another example of the limitation of loft is that if two targeting constructs are needed to insert the 5' and 3' loxp sites, as in the case of floxing a large dna fragment, then creating the allelic series in loft will accordingly require two constructs. furthermore, cre/flpo cannot always efficiently delete target sequences. indeed, flpo-catalyzed removal of the gene-trap cassette at the baf <dig> locus was only around 5% in the thymus by day  <dig>  this problem can be addressed by monitoring the deletion via gfp expression, and by the use of the new version of conditional flp  that is efficient 'in any tissue at any time during development or in the adult'  <cit> . with this version of flp, joyner and colleagues found that a single injection of tam was sufficient to induce widespread and efficient deletion of a reporter gene in the embryos and adults within  <dig> and  <dig> days, respectively, whereas the version used in the current study  barely works under this condition  <cit> . the new enzyme is expected to make loft widely applicable. however, the old version , which is efficient in peripheral t cells but not thymocytes, has a unique advantage for studying developmental programming of t-cell functions. as mentioned above, such studies entail gene inactivation in the thymocytes and subsequent reactivation in mature t cells. as the thymus continues to export t cells into the periphery in adults, the peripheral t-cell pool would be significantly contaminated with the confounding t cells that have undergone premature reactivation, if flp is allowed to work efficiently in the thymocytes. the final limitation of loft involves the fact that most of the floxed alleles recently generated by the european conditional mouse mutagenesis  carry an frt site outside the floxed sequence. if these alleles are paired with reversible ko alleles, interchromosomal recombination can occur after flp activation. these recombination events are presumably too rare to confound data interpretation, unless they lead to dominant effects such as tumorigenesis. however, such effects are in themselves interesting, and so the nuisance may be a blessing in disguise.

utility of baf57Δr and baf57f
baf57Δr is a null allele that can be rescued by deleting the gene-trap cassette. baf57Δr homozygous mice are apparently embryonic lethal, which precludes the analysis of the effect of baf <dig> ko in adult tissues. this problem may be solved by deleting the gene-trap cassette  in a fraction of cells in the embryo, which may rescue the embryo to produce mosaic adults containing baf <dig> ko, het, and wt cells, which are distinguishable based on  gfp expression. such mosaic mice will be the source of cells lacking baf <dig> 

in contrast to baf57Δr, baf57f was designed to be a conditional hypomorphic allele expressing a deletion mutant at a low level, following excision of the floxed sequence. instead, we detected three truncated proteins that seemed to result, at least in part, from alternatively spliced transcripts. in addition, although the mutants were indeed expressed at very low levels in the presence of the allele expressing wt baf <dig>  they accumulated in the absence of wt baf <dig>  despite these unexpected changes, homozygous deletion of the floxed exons in dp cells caused a phenotype resembling, albeit weaker than, that resulting from overexpressing the baf <dig> dominant-negative mutant lacking the first  <dig> aa, confirming that baf57f is a conditional hypomorphic allele. we are now extending the analysis to other tissues, by deleting the floxed exons from the germline. we suspect that the mice lacking the two exons will be viable, but may display some specific defects. this allele may thus enable us to interrogate the role of baf <dig> in a way not feasible with any baf <dig> null allele, whether the null is constitutive or conditional. finally, our ultimate goal of developing this method is to study the potential role of baf <dig> in epigenetic programming of mature t cells. although no gross functional defects in mature t cells were detected in baf57f/Δr; cd4-cre; r26flpoer <dig> mice, some specific, subtle defects may exist. because the mature t cells are resting, it would be possible to test whether restoring baf <dig> expression in these cells can rescue the pre-existing phenotype, and we are therefore systematically searching for the putative functional defects in the mature t cells.

CONCLUSIONS
reversible regulation of endogenous genes in mice is necessary for addressing multiple important biological questions. we have combined the cre/lox and gene-trap systems to develop loft, a reliable and straightforward reversible cko method. loft lacks the limitations of the pre-existing reversible gene regulatory systems, and can also be used to producing traditional constitutive ko and cko mice. it offers an advantageous alternative to the conventional gene-targeting methods.
