BACKGROUND
high density  genotyping arrays have become extremely valuable tools for genomic analyses of human, model organisms and farm animal species due to their genome-wide coverage and high throughput nature. such arrays are being widely used for many purposes including the detection of genetic associations with complex traits, fine mapping of quantitative trait loci , detecting signatures of selection, and increasingly for implementing genomic selection  to farm animal species. in this paper, we describe the development of a hd genotyping array  for chicken, which is the first of this magnitude in chicken and has been commercially released for both public and proprietary use.

the chicken is not only a major livestock animal but also an excellent model organism for genetic and evolutionary studies such as for detecting natural and artificial selection under domestication  <cit> . a large amount of genomic information is already publicly available for this species including a near-complete reference genome, more than  <dig>  m genetic variants in public databases , and more than  <dig>  qtls in the chicken qtldb . in spite of all these resources no hd genotyping array is yet available for this species that can facilitate high throughput investigation of many individuals for research and commercial breeding. a number of studies, however, have reported the use of low to medium  density panels for various purposes  <cit>  but these panels were proprietary and have not been made available for wider use. in contrast, for cattle, for example, two hd genotyping arrays  are now available  <cit> .

a major determinant of the utility of an array is the density of its marker panel. our goal in developing the hd array for chicken was that the array should be versatile and suitable for addressing the different purposes described above in a diverse range for chicken breeds and populations. the effectiveness of an array will also depend on its ability to exploit the linkage disequilibrium  structure of the genome of the target population. previous studies have shown that the ld pattern in chicken varies not only across chromosomes and genomic regions but also varies widely among breeds  <cit> . moreover, previous studies  <cit>  have also shown that a large amount of genetic variation still exists both within and among the domesticated and commercial chicken breeds despite many generations of selection. all these indicate that to achieve a wide applicability of the array for diverse breeds, an hd panel would be more desirable than low or medium density ones. for instance, according to megens et al. <cit>  a whole-genome marker assay for chicken would require more than  <dig> k snps  to exploit the ld and haplotype information. therefore to achieve this we set the target of including in the array as many snps as possible with an even coverage of the genome, limited only by the capacity of the genotyping platform . these limits are determined by the allelic types of the variants and the number of probes required for querying those.

developing a hd array, however, requires a large collection of snps segregating within populations to select from. several studies have reported detection of a large number of snps from chicken, most notably, the detection of  <dig>  m snps by wong et al. <cit>  by analysing single birds from three breeds, and detection of over  <dig> m snps by rubin et al. <cit>  by analysing pooled samples from each of eight domesticated broiler and layer lines. nevertheless, for practical applications using a hd genotyping array we intended to create a larger catalogue of snps that are segregating within diverse chicken populations. next generation sequencing  technology has made the whole-genome sequencing of many individuals practical by making it affordable and rapid. we, therefore, used a ngs platform  to re-sequence  <dig> birds from  <dig> lines representing commercial broiler and layer breeds, and several experimental and inbred lines. similar to rubin et al. <cit>  we also adopted a pooled dna sequencing approach and aligned the sequenced reads to the chicken reference genome for detecting snps. using standard criteria we detected ~ <dig> m snps of which about  <dig> m were segregating within one or more lines. we used several stringent criteria to reduce the number to a set of high quality snps and then applied an iterative algorithm to select a list of ~ <dig>  m snps, evenly distributed across the genome, for further validation. we used the genetic map distance  rather than physical distance  to account for the differential recombination rates across the chromosomes to assess the evenness of distribution across the genome. the final array was created using  <dig>  validated snps. this paper describes the detection, selection and validation of snps to create a  <dig> k hd affymetrix® axiom® genotyping array and discusses the potential application of this array.

RESULTS
sequencing of birds and mapping of sequence reads
the  <dig> sequenced individuals originated from  <dig> lines including four commercial broilers, six commercial white egg layers , five commercial brown egg layers , eight experimental inbred layers and one unselected layer line . over  <dig>  billion reads were generated by sequencing the samples. when aligned against the new chicken reference genome , about  <dig>  billion reads  mapped to the genome and about  <dig>  billion reads  mapped with a mapping quality score ≥  <dig>  while the intended depth of coverage of sequencing was 10– <dig> folds, the actual coverage varied between  <dig> and  <dig> fold across different lines, with the potential loss appearing from failure of some reads to map at all or map with confidence . although the current build of the reference genome  represents ~96% of the chicken genome, some of the smaller micro-chromosomes are not yet represented  <cit> . besides chromosome  <dig>  is only partially represented with the length of about  <dig> kb whereas the full estimated size of this chromosome is 9– <dig> mb  <cit> . this is one of the reasons for failure of some reads to map to the genome, the other possible reasons being the presence of repeat contents and poor quality of some reads.

.

to be able to detect snps from unmapped sequence regions, which potentially include unrepresented micro-chromosomes, we created a de novo assembly of the good quality unmapped reads. this resulted in  <dig>  contigs with a total size of approximately  <dig> mb. for detection of snps, we only used contigs with a length greater than  <dig> bases. there were  <dig>  such contigs with the total length of about  <dig>  mb. the mean size of these contigs was about  <dig> bases with a maximum size of  <dig>  kb.

snp detection
initially snp detection was done separately within each line. the criteria used for calling snps were:  the snp position must be covered by at least five sequencing reads with a map-quality score ≥ 20;  relevant bases must have a base-quality score ≥  <dig> and  the snp quality score must be ≥  <dig>  to minimise the risk of detecting false positives from duplicated genome regions, any snps with coverage more than three standard deviations from the mean coverage were excluded. the number of segregating snps detected per line ranged between  <dig> k to over  <dig> m  with average numbers being approximately  <dig> m,  <dig>  m and  <dig> m for broiler, layer and inbred lines respectively. in total  <dig> m segregating snps were detected from this within-line analysis. apart from these snps, an additional  <dig>  snps were identified from the contigs that were assembled de novo. additional file 1: table s <dig>  shows the number of snps and their proportional distribution across the chromosomes. much fewer snps  were detected from chr <dig> mainly because of the partial representation of this chromosome in the current reference genome. on the contrary, in spite of a very high quality assembly for chromosome z  in the current reference genome, we observed a very low density of snps on this chromosome . our result, however, corroborates with the findings of previous studies which reported reduced genetic variations on this chromosome for a multitude of potential reasons such as low male effective population size due to skewed reproductive success among males, selective sweep due to selection on sex-linked characters combined with lower recombination rates on chrz than on autosomes  <cit> .

we investigated what proportion of the publicly available snps was also discovered in our project. on request, we received from ncbi, a list of about  <dig>  m snps . comparison suggests, about 65% of these snps are present in our  <dig> m list.

in order to call snps from low coverage regions with greater confidence, we combined reads from all the  <dig> lines to perform a “global analysis”. the same snp-calling criteria mentioned for the within-line analyses were used for this analysis resulting in the discovery of ~ <dig> m snps. this analysis, however, detected not only segregating snps within lines but also the ones that are fixed in different lines for alternate alleles.

snp selection
due to the very high number of snps detected in the previous steps, a multi-step filtering strategy was followed to reduce the number to a robust and tractable subset for hd array design. the filtering was done on the list of  <dig> m snps obtained from the within-line analyses as the goal was to use snps segregating within lines primarily to design an array of most practical use. the  <dig> m snp list, however, was consulted for regions where few or no high quality snps were detected from within-line analysis. the filtering steps are summarised in figure  <dig> 

snp reduction based on quality score and low minor allele frequency
in the first step of filtration, an attempt was made to reduce further the occurrence of false positives from the detection stage. snps were accepted only if at least one of the following criteria was satisfied:  the snps with quality scores ≥  <dig> and minor allele frequency  ≥  <dig>  from the within-line detected set;  snps from global analysis meeting the same criteria as in , irrespective of their quality scores and mafs in the within-line analyses;  the snp was present in previous panels or detected by rubin et al. <cit> . filtration based on these criteria resulted in approximately  <dig> m snps.

the above criteria were ignored for snps on chr <dig> and chrz to maximize the retention of putative snps which are potentially linked to the mhc gene complex and sex-linked characters, whilst accepting the risk of having some sequencing artefacts.

snp reduction based on close proximity and possible clustering artefacts
in this step, snps that were located very close to each other were removed. very tightly spaced snps are less likely to be successfully assayed during genotyping, due to the interference from the neighbouring variant. also snp clustering may appear due to mis-alignment of reads due to the presence of indels  at the beginning or end of reads  <cit> . in developing a  <dig> k illumina array for chicken groenen et al. <cit>  removed snps which were in  <dig> bp of each other on either side but here we retained snps that had at least  <dig> bp of snp free region on one side and ≥ <dig> bp on the other side because of flexibility of the affymetrix® axiom® platform. again, for chr <dig> and chrz, all the snps were retained without any selection at this stage. the outcome of this filtering was a list of approximately  <dig> m snps.

a substantial proportion of the snps were shared amongst the different lines, indicating their potential utility to multiple lines, although those spanning across most of the lines are likely to be ancient variants. venn diagrams in figure  <dig> a and b show the shared snps between broiler, layer and inbred lines, and broiler, wel and bel respectively. in summary, about 23% of the  <dig> m snps were found to be common among broiler, layer and inbred lines while 31% snps were found to be common between broiler, bel and wel. the size of the circles in venn diagrams also represents the relative proportion of the snps contributed from different groups in the  <dig> m list.

snp reduction based on in-silico analysis of predicted performance on axiom® arrays
the  <dig> m snps selected in the above step were submitted to affymetrix for an in-silico analysis to predict their reproducibility in the axiom® array. two types of design scores were generated from this analysis:  16-mer count, which is the number of times all  <dig> bp sequences in the  <dig> bp flanking region from either side of the snp had a matched sequence in the genome and  p-convert value, which arises from a random forest model intended to predict the probability that the snp will convert on the array. the model considers factors including probe sequence, binding energies, and the expected degree of non-specific binding and hybridization to multiple genomic regions. these scores were generated both for forward and reverse probes. lower 16-mer counts and greater p-convert values are better for array design. the chance of a snp converting with a 16-mer count above  <dig> is extremely low and the chance of conversion increases monotonically as the score decreases. therefore the thresholds were set to be: 16-mer count ≤  <dig> and the p-convert value ≥  <dig> .

of the  <dig> m snps tested, ~73% had a p-convert value ≥  <dig>  and ~93% had a 16-mer count ≤ <dig> . taking both the design matrices together, ~66% of the snps had the required design scores  irrespective of whether the forward or reverse probes were considered.

selection of snps for validation
the fourth step was to prepare a list of ~ <dig>  m snps for validation through genotyping. the objective was to have an even distribution of segregating snps across the genome. to achieve this we spread out the snps evenly in terms of genetic map distance as provided by groenen et al. <cit>  instead of using the physical distance, to account for the difference in the cm/mb ratio between macro- and micro-chromosomes. the ratio of the snps segregating within broiler and layer lines was kept at 1: <dig>  a custom made iterative algorithm  was used to select the list of  <dig>  m snps with the desired criteria. the algorithm first created a backbone by adding evenly spaced snps which were segregating across all  <dig> lines. then it uniformly placed snps for layers that guarantee the target density  for a line. the same step was applied to ensure the target density for broiler snps balanced by lines.

snp validation result and selection of final  <dig> k panel
validation through genotyping of ~ <dig>  m snps was performed by manufacturing three affymetrix® axiom® arrays . the major purposes of validation were to assess for each snp:  the conversion performance in the array in terms of genotype call rate, cluster separation and reproducibility,  polymorphism in different sets of commercial and wild chicken breeds,  stable mendelian inheritance from parents to offspring, and  population characteristics in terms of allele frequency distribution, ld and hardy-weinberg equilibrium  probability. the ultimate goal was to use this information to select a robust set of ~ <dig> k snps for the final genotyping array. the validation was carried out on an independent set of  <dig> individuals including  <dig> trio samples from three broiler lines, four wel lines, five bel lines and  <dig> individuals from a wide range of diverse traditional breeds of chicken .

population characteristics of the validated snps were explored to make informed decisions about selecting the final  <dig> k panel. any snps that showed an extreme departure  from the hwe were removed. while snps that show departure from hwe can actually be important as they might represent regions under selection, an extreme departure might indicate genotyping errors, presence of copy number variants  or lethal recessive mutation and hence were removed.

the same custom algorithm as used in the previous step for selecting  <dig>  m snps was again used for reducing the  <dig>  m to  <dig> k, with the only difference that the broiler and layer snps were selected in a ratio of 3: <dig>  the rationale for choosing a higher proportion of broiler snps in the final panel is that a number of recent studies have shown a higher extent of ld in layer compared to broiler  <cit>  indicating that broilers would require a larger set of segregating snps compared to layers to capture the same amount of genetic information. again the genetic map distance was used to spread the snps across the genome. figure  <dig> shows the average number of snps per unit physical distance and unit genetic map distance, clearly indicating that the snps are much more uniformly distributed based on genetic map distance than the physical distance in the final  <dig> k panel. since one of the objectives of the panel design was to increase its utility for genome-wide-association studies  or gs, it was essential to target equi-distant snps across the whole genome. the use of the genetic rather than the physical distance as a unit to distribute snps ensured that the density per cm in micro-chromosomes was the same as in macro-chromosomes. the smaller chromosomes have a higher recombination rate and higher gene density  <cit>  and hence, a good coverage is crucial since they may explain a considerable proportion of the genetic variance.

to maximise the utility of the panel for qtl detection studies, all the validated snps from exonic or coding regions  were included in the panel of which  <dig>  were predicted to be either non-synonymous or stop-loss/stop-gain types. table  <dig> shows the predicted effects of the snps that have been included in the final  <dig> k panel. studies on human and model organisms predict that most high penetrance  diseases or traits are mediated by polymorphisms in the protein coding regions of the genome  <cit> . although generally the non-synonymous and stop-loss or stop-gain snps are implicated to be disease causing, the synonymous snps can be useful by being in strong ld with functional mutations. about 15% of the snps in our study could not be annotated properly as their co-ordinates could not be resolved unambiguously when mapped to the previous genome assembly  for annotation purpose.

no direct selection was performed based on maf as the frequency estimates were not sufficiently precise due to small sample sizes. however, an attempt was made to include snps which are common to many lines to maximise the utility of the hd array. figure  <dig> shows that the frequency distribution of snps is more or less even across different maf classes across broiler, wel and bel groups.

the final  <dig> k array has  <dig>  snps in total. based on the genotyped samples used for validation, the number of polymorphic snps ranged between  <dig>  to  <dig>  per commercial line. this number is expected to rise for each line with screening of more samples. about 21%-53% of the snps in the final panel were also found to be polymorphic in the different traditional breeds of chicken that were included in the validation sample set even though only  <dig> or  <dig> individuals per breed were analysed. this confirms the versatility of the panel. the final panel includes  <dig>  snps which were detected on contigs that were assembled denovo from unmapped reads in the current study. as mentioned earlier we used the pre-published version of the gallus_gallus_ <dig>  for mapping our reads as this assembly was unpublished at the time of the work. however, recently the assembly has been published in the ncbi database and contains added features such as “unlocalized scaffolds”  and “unplaced” . we mapped the denovo snps against this published reference. this mapping result showed that except  <dig> snps, the rest mapped to either some chromosomes  or unlocalized scaffolds  or chr_un . all the snps in the panel have been submitted to ncbi’s dbsnp and can be accessed via the link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/snp/snp_viewbatch.cgi?sbid= <dig> 

the snps in the final array are distributed across the genome with a mean  inter-marker spacing of 1748 ±  <dig> bases. about 98% of the markers are distributed across the genome with a gap size less than  <dig> kb, but there are some regions which have larger gap sizes and they cover about 10% of the genome . most of these larger gaps are found in the macro-chromosomes, particularly on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and z.

pca analysis of population structure using  <dig> k array genotypes
detecting the underlying population structure is of interest for many population related studies, particularly for gwas as population stratification can lead to many spurious associations if not accounted for properly  <cit> . we performed a principal component analysis  using the genotype data to investigate the ability of the  <dig> k panel to detect population stratification in the validated samples. figure  <dig> shows the relative co-ordinates of individuals when plotted using the two largest principal components. individuals originating from the same line clustered together tightly and related groups  also appeared in close proximity. the broiler lines were placed relatively close to bel compared to wel, while the latter two groups were placed further apart indicating their different origins.

the relatively close proximity of broilers and bels in the pca plot is related to their shared ancestry as these breeds were originally established by crossing the european and asian breeds  <cit> . in contrast, the wel originated from the single comb white leghorn breed which is of european origin  <cit> . our pca results are thus in agreement with the existing knowledge of the origin of the lines/breeds and are also in agreement with the previous studies such as by eding et al. <cit>  and elferink et al. <cit>  which showed phylogenetic relationship among different poultry breeds.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we described the development of the first hd snp array containing  <dig>  snps for chicken that is more dense compared to the hd arrays available for other farm species such as the  <dig> k illumina high-density bovine beadchip array or the  <dig> k affymetrix® axiom® genome-wide bos  <dig> array for cattle considering the fact that the chicken genome is about one third the size of the bovine genome. the array is expected to be useful for gwas, gs, fine mapping of qtls, analysis of genome wide selection signatures, detection of cnvs and other genomic analyses and will be available for public and private use.

important features of our array development approach included:  sequencing of pooled samples using a ngs method which has allowed screening of a large number of individuals rapidly and cost effectively leading to the detection of a large collection of snps segregating between and most importantly, within diverse populations;  applying stringent filtering criteria to minimize inclusion of false positives that appear as artifacts of ngs;  inclusion of validated snps in the final array that are proven to work in the axiom® platform;  distributing the snps on the basis of map distance rather than physical distance to increase the ability to track genomic segments across generations;  using an iterative algorithm to select the snps to obtain a balanced representation from all the lines tested. the call rates from genotyping using the array are expected to be very high which is confirmed from the initial results of large-scale genotyping in broiler and layer lines . we have also shown through validation that the panel will be usable on traditional chicken breeds, different gallus subspecies. the array has been commercially released for academic and industrial use.

even though we have applied a very thorough approach in developing this array, future projects with a similar goal can consider a number of areas for improvement. one potential area of improvement is barcoding the individual samples before sequencing the pooled dna as this would enable more information to be extracted from sequence data such as would allow better estimates of the allele frequencies. while this approach was not used in the current project to keep the cost down, future projects may consider this option as the cost of barcoding and library preparation are declining. moreover, with the rapidly declining cost of sequencing, it would also be possible to increase the coverage and the number of birds for sequencing in future studies. another area where the future arrays can attempt to improve is the inclusion of more snps from chr <dig>  chrw and some of the micro-chromosomes, which was not possible in our case due to poor representation of these chromosomes in the current genome build.
