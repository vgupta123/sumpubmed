BACKGROUND
antibodies are the most widely used biomolecules for therapeutic, diagnostic and research applications, because they can be generated against virtually any molecule using protein engineering techniques . however, antibodies have certain fundamental disadvantages such as the complex architecture of their antigen-binding site, low stability, and a rather large size  <cit> . moreover, the production of full-size antibodies is relatively expensive  <cit> . to overcome these limitations and to improve therapeutic antibodies, antibodies have been extensively engineered  <cit> . for example the size of the antibody molecule has been reduced by producing single-domain antigen-binding derivatives  <cit> . in addition to extensive antibody engineering, a versatile repertoire of tailored biomolecules from non-immunoglobulin protein scaffolds have been generated  <cit> . anticalins, derived from the lipocalin fold, are a good example of engineered proteins  <cit> . the β-barrel structure of lipocalins is thermostable and robust and serves as an excellent scaffold for engineering novel receptors. they have been modified to bind novel ligands, such as fluorescein and digoxigenin, with affinities comparable with antibodies  <cit> .

chicken avidin , known for its extremely high affinity towards the water-soluble vitamin h, d-biotin, has been widely used in life science research applications  <cit> . aside from biotin, avd also binds dyes and peptides, which share no significant structural similarity with biotin  <cit> . avd provides an attractive robust scaffold for the development of novel receptors, and avd has many advantageous properties such as high chemical and thermal stability, a deep ligand binding site optimized for the binding of small molecules, and an oligomeric nature enabling signal amplification. moreover, the structure of avd is well characterized  <cit>  and numerous engineered forms of avd have been described  <cit> . engineered avd forms, in which the two pairs of the binding sites   <cit>  or all four binding sites   <cit>  can be independently manipulated, have been developed.

in the present study avd was modified to bind steroid hormones. avd mutant sbavd- <dig>  which was captured using the phage display selection  <cit> , has a micromolar affinity to testosterone. the steroid-binding protein sbavd- <dig> was characterized and further engineered to decrease cross-reactivity towards other molecules, especially towards avd's natural ligand biotin. the resulting sbavd- <dig> mutant with a modified loop between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> was found to prefer steroid hormones over biotin in ligand binding.

RESULTS
functional display of avd protein on the m <dig> phage
avd was displayed on the surface of the m <dig> phage as a fusion with the c-terminal region of the minor coat protein piii. two different strategies for displaying the avd scaffold in the active form on the m <dig> phage were evaluated. in the first display construct, avd was produced solely as a fusion with piii , whereas in the avd/avd-piii display construct, free avd subunits were produced in addition to the piii fusion .

the size and oligomeric state of the avd-piii fusions were analyzed by sds-page and by western blot. polyclonal anti-avd  indicated expression of both the avd-piii fusion  and the free avd . the production of free subunits should enhance the functional assembly of the tetrameric avd scaffold, especially if membrane anchoring of avd by the piii fusion partner has a negative effect on the oligomerization of avd subunits. this strategy mimics the generally used amber-stop codon technique, in which free subunits are produced by the read-through of amber stop codon by the trna. we assume that the oligomerization of avd, secreted by the pelb signal sequence, occurs in the periplasmic space of e. coli, allowing the display of functional avd on the phage, as is the case for the display of the antibody fab fragment, which requires folding of the heavy and light chains for the assembly of a functional antibody molecule  <cit> .

lane 1: avd-piii phage; lane 2: avd-piii phage; lane 3: avd/avd-piii phage; lane 4: avd/avd-piii phage. the molecular weights of standard proteins are shown as kilodaltons on the left side of each blot.

a portion of the avd-piii fusion was partially proteolytically cleaved, as can be seen from the blot analyzed with the anti-piii monoclonal antibody . because avd display constructs designed in this study were based on the monovalent display mode , the intact piii  expressed from the helper phage was also detected from the blot .

avd-displaying phages were functional because they bound specifically to the biotin-coated surfaces, and phages were efficiently amplified even after several panning rounds. moreover, phagemid dna with the avd display expression unit, which was confirmed by the restriction enzyme digestion analysis, was stable during the panning rounds .

to analyze the functionality of phages, the mixture of amplified avd and avd mutant n118m phages were screened by panning against 4-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid . as determined in our previous study, the biotin binding affinity of the avd mutant n118m was reduced ~ <dig> ,000-fold  and haba-affinity was increased ~ <dig> -fold  compared to wtavd  <cit>  . during the panning procedure a clear enrichment of avd phages over wt avd phages was detected, which was an indication of the high selectivity of the produced phages. after only three rounds of selection phages displaying the avd mutant n118m outcompeted the wtavd phage population .

capture of a steroid-binding avidin
the loops adjacent to the ligand-binding site were selected for randomization  <cit> . first we created a library  in which residues n <dig>  d <dig>  l <dig>  g <dig>  and s <dig> were randomized. these amino acids form a loop between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> . codon nnn was used for randomization, and therefore, all  <dig> different amino acids were present, including all stop codons. the avd l <dig>  library was ligated into a phagemid as a sole fusion with the c-terminal portion of piii. based on sequencing results and transformation efficiency, the avd l <dig>  library was found to consist of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> individual members. when a stretch of five amino acid residues is completely randomized, the theoretical library size is  <dig>  ×  <dig> 

in the panning experiments avd l <dig>  loop library phages were introduced onto a testosterone-coated surface. the phage genomes carrying the mutated cdna were found to be stable during the selection. a clear enrichment of sequences in the randomized loop area was observed, indicating the success of the selection conditions. interestingly, we detected n <dig> as being a highly conserved amino acid residue among the enriched pool of proteins. an avd variant, named sbavd- <dig>  that carried the sequence n <dig>  r <dig>  m <dig>  n <dig>  h <dig> was selected for further analysis.

the specificity of sbavd- <dig> can be tuned by additional mutations in the loop between β-strands  <dig> and 4
to further lower the biotin-binding affinity and to decrease the cross-reactivity of steroid-binding avd, a library  was generated in which the loop area between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> was randomized . the loop between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> is highly important for biotin binding of avd because this loop 'locks' biotin into the binding site. in this process, three amino acid residues in the loop form direct interactions with biotin  <cit> . in the library four amino acids  were randomized using the nny codon. the use of this codon covers  <dig> of the  <dig> naturally occurring amino acids while eliminating all of the stop codons. the library consisted of approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> individual members, when calculated from the sequencing results and transformation efficiency, which exceeds the theoretical size of the library calculated based on the possible combinations of amino acid residues .

binders from the sbavd- <dig> l <dig>  library were selected by phage display panning against a testosterone surface. in every panning round washes were adjusted according to the number of output colonies. the quality of the phage genomes carrying the mutated cdna was evaluated by dna sequencing at various stages during selection. a combination of acid and testosterone was used for elution. the selected sbavd- <dig> phage clones were evaluated by microplate analysis using bsa-testosterone as a target ligand and utilizing m13-antibody to determine the amount of bound phages. the sbavd- <dig> variant that showed the highest binding activity in the microplate assay  had the sequence a <dig>  t <dig>  v <dig>  n <dig>  this mutant, named sbavd- <dig> was selected for comparative analysis with sbavd- <dig> 

production and purification of avd mutants
proteins were produced in soluble form in the e. coli strain bl21-ai using n-terminal ompa bacterial secretion signal from bordetella avium  <cit> . proteins were purified by ni-nta affinity chromatography that yielded ~ <dig> mg/l pure protein. according to gel-filtration analysis, in solution, both sbavd- <dig>  and sbavd- <dig>  showed tetrameric state  similar to that of wtavd . the slight decrease in molecular weight of avd expressed in bacteria can be explained by the lack of glycosylation.

determination of ligand-binding specificity of avd forms by microplate assay
the binding specificity of proteins was analyzed by microplate assay, in which a set of different small molecules were used as a target molecules . wtavd was used as a negative control, and we detected no affinity towards the ligands except biotin. importantly, sbavd- <dig> and sbavd- <dig> did not bind the proteins used as carriers for small molecules  and human serum albumin ). however, these modified avds showed clear binding to testosterone and progesterone.

the binding to the surface-immobilized ligands was inhibited by pre-incubating the proteins with  <dig> μm d-biotin . free biotin significantly inhibited the binding of sbavd- <dig> to steroids, indicating notable affinity towards biotin. however, in the case of sbavd- <dig> the binding of testosterone and progesterone was not affected by biotin, showing a clear decrease in biotin-binding affinity.

biosensor analyses of steroid-binding avds
the kinetic constants of testosterone- and biotin-binding to steroid-binding proteins were determined with surface plasmon resonance  analysis. the purified sbavd- <dig> and sbavd- <dig> bound to a testosterone-bsa-coated sensor chip with similar affinities , whereas wtavd showed no binding to the testosterone surface. furthermore, testosterone-binding was inhibited with varying testosterone concentrations . in the case of sbavd- <dig>  the 50% inhibition was achieved between 5- <dig> μm testosterone, which is consistent with the determined testosterone surface binding affinity. interestingly, the 50% inhibition was already achieved in  <dig> nm testosterone concentration in the sbavd- <dig> measurements. this result suggests a much higher binding affinity towards free testosterone than that measured towards surface-immobilized testosterone.

the kinetic parameters determined by spr analysis. the biotin binding affinity of avidin is too high to be determined by spr. the transition midpoint of thermal unfolding  and the calorimetric heat of unfolding were determined by dsc. delta tm represents the increase of tm in the presence of  <dig> μm ligand.

the biotin binding of the steroid-binding proteins was analyzed by the biotin-coated sensor chip. the comparison of sbavd- <dig> and sbavd- <dig> revealed that the biotin-binding affinity decreased almost 500-fold due to the modification of the loop between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> . this result appears to be consistent with the previous study in which mutation of t35a alone decreased the biotin-binding affinity of wtavd approximately 200-fold  <cit> .

the specificity of the steroid-binding was analyzed by binding competition using the following steroids: testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate , androstenedione, estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone . in addition, the binding to the surface was also competed for by biotin. sbavd- <dig> was found to be cross-reactive with androgens highly similar to testosterone , and had noticeable affinity towards biotin . interestingly, dht showed less efficient inhibition compared to testosterone, suggesting lower binding affinity towards this steroid form. the binding of sbavd- <dig> to testosterone was found to be most efficiently inhibited by testosterone and dheas , whereas the inhibition caused by biotin was clearly weaker than that in the case of sbavd- <dig>  this result is consistent with the microplate analysis results and with the binding kinetic constants determined with spr analysis.

interaction analysis of steroid-binding avds by mrfs
molecular recognition force spectroscopy   <cit>  was used to study the interaction between sbavds and testosterone on a single molecule level. an atomic force microscopy  tip was functionalized with a single testosterone molecule  <cit>  and repeatedly approached and retracted from the sbavd-1- or sbavd-2-coated surface . the binding forces were measured in force-distance cycles, whereby the deflection  of the cantilever was recorded as a function of the tip-sample distance. for evaluation,  <dig>  force-distance cycles were recorded, and probability density functions  were generated from the detected interaction forces  <cit> . the tip-tethered testosterone was found to form a complex with the sbavds; the retraction led to a downward bending of the cantilever until a particular force was reached resulting in the rupture of the bond between testosterone and sbavd . the most probable unbinding force  <cit>  was found to be similar for both of the testosterone-sbavd complexes:  <dig> pn at a constant pulling velocity of  <dig> nm/s. from  <dig>  recorded force-distance cycles, sbavd- <dig> showed  <dig> detected interactions and sbavd- <dig> showed  <dig> events.

to prove the specificity of the measured interactions, control experiments were performed. for these experiments, free testosterone was injected into the measuring solution to preoccupy the binding sites of the steroid-binding protein immobilized on the surface. the retraction curve identical to the approaching curve was detected , which indicated the total inhibition of the binding by free testosterone. additionally, when the binding sites were preoccupied with free testosterone, the number of binding events dropped down to  <dig> from  <dig> detected interactions in the case of sbavd- <dig>  in case of sbavd- <dig> the number of interactions dropped from of  <dig> to  <dig> after addition of free testosterone.

differential scanning calorimetry reveals the high stability of the engineered proteins
the high thermal stability of wtavd  =  <dig> °c) was preserved in the steroid-binding mutants; these proteins showed similar tm values compared to wtavd  . ligand binding often stabilizes a protein and raises the tm value. as expected, the addition of biotin stabilized wtavd effectively, increasing the tm value almost 40°c. this tm indicates a very high binding affinity.

the effect of biotin-binding on the protein stability of steroid-binding proteins was much smaller than in the case of wtavd, thus showing decreased biotin affinity. in fact, sbavd- <dig> showed a negligible increase in tm in the presence of biotin . the presence of testosterone only slightly increased the tm values of sbavds . actually, a similarly small increase was detected in the Δtm value of wtavd when testosterone was added. however, because the testosterone-binding of wtavd was not detected in other analyses  the mechanism of stabilization remains unclear.

discussion
in the present study, avd proteins were displayed on the m <dig> phage in a monovalent form fused with the c-terminal region  of the coat protein piii. the crucial requirement for the functional display on phage is successful expression of the protein in e. coli. as has been earlier reported avd protein can be efficiently expressed in a soluble form in e. coli  <cit> . the close relative of avd, streptavidin, has been displayed on bacterial phages as a pviii fusion  <cit> . however, to our best knowledge, chicken avd has not been previously displayed on phages for screening purposes.

to evaluate the different modes for avd display, we generated constructs expressing piii fused to avd and constructs that expressed free avd subunits in addition to the piii fusions. based on the expression analysis, binding properties and selection experiments, the construct that expressed both fusion and free avd showed an enhanced assembly of functional, tetrameric avd on the phage compared to the avd-piii fusion alone . however, the construct that expressed piii-fused avd was chosen for use in the selection system for the generation of gene libraries because the use of only one avd gene in the protein display would ensure that the selected proteins could be assembled to homotetramers.

the potential of the developed platform for screening novel avd-based receptors was investigated. five residues in the loop between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> of avd were randomized to generate a population of diverse avd genes. the gene population was screened for novel binding properties using the phage display method  <cit> . we observed the enrichment of avd phages binding to testosterone-coupled bsa. the avd variant sbavd- <dig>  which carried the sequence n <dig>  r <dig>  m <dig>  n <dig>  h <dig>  was further analyzed and found to bind free testosterone with an affinity similar to bsa-conjugated testosterone. moreover, we detected that the biotin-binding affinity of sbavd- <dig> was not completely diminished; it was still high enough to inhibit sbavd- <dig> from binding to testosterone-bsa . this finding confirmed that testosterone occupies the same binding site in avd as does biotin. based on the cross-creativity measurements, sbavd- <dig> also binds other steroid hormones, such as progesterone and dheas .

sbavd- <dig> was further engineered to decrease biotin binding and to improve steroid specificity. from the phage display selections, the sbavd-1-derived protein, named sbavd- <dig>  with a mutated loop between β-strands  <dig> and  <dig> was captured. this mutant showed similar or slightly decreased binding affinity towards immobilized testosterone, whereas the biotin-binding affinity was clearly decreased . we also noticed that sbavd- <dig> bound more tightly to free testosterone than did sbavd- <dig> . significantly, sbavd- <dig> preferred steroids as a ligand over biotin; this finding is important when considering the applications for biofluids, in which biotin is often present in relatively high concentrations.

this study and our preliminary results from experiments with a number of different target ligands  suggest that avd-based receptors for various different small molecules can be tailored. these avd-based receptors may be valuable tools for diagnostic use in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study provides a promising platform for the selection of tailored ligand-binders evolved from the avd scaffold in the monovalent piii protein display. the avd scaffold has characteristics that are beneficial in protein engineering, such as high thermal and chemical stability, simple folding and an optimal structure for small ligands. furthermore, avd can be modified rather freely without major change in the fold  <cit> . novel avds that can simultaneously bind multiple ligands could become next-generation molecular tools for clinical and diagnostic applications  <cit> . importantly, novel avd-based receptors could be used in applications that require harsh conditions.
