BACKGROUND
over the last decades, genetic progress has been associated with a rise in perinatal mortality in the domestic pig   <cit> . in  <dig>  strange et al.  <cit>  noted that piglet mortality mostly occurs in the first  <dig> hours after birth. because the pig is one of the most important meat-producing livestock species world-wide, this high piglet mortality at birth is a source of both economic  <cit>  and ethical problems . postnatal mortality is not an issue in pigs alone but also affects other mammals like sheep or humans  <cit> . in humans, for example, out of  <dig> million cases of infant death during the first four weeks of life, 28% are due to prematurity issues  <cit> . adaptation to extra-uterine life is therefore a major factor for survival.

in pigs, various factors contributing to survival at birth have already been identified. they depend on maternal traits , piglet characteristics  or environment  <cit> . as suggested by van der lende  <cit> , one of these factors is maturity. maturation process was described to occur at the end of gestation, from  <dig> days of gestation to birth   <cit> . leenhouwers et al.  <cit>  showed that a greater physiological maturity at birth is responsible for a higher survival. thus, a successful maturation process leads to a state of full development and promotes early survival after birth  <cit> .

piglet maturity involves characteristics such as body size, body weight, organ characteristics and availability of body energy reserves such as glycogen or lipids  <cit> . maturity is also coupled with the efficiency of physiological functions like thermoregulation, which is the balance between heat loss and heat production  <cit> . although body weight has an influence on survival at birth, several studies suggest that it is not the only indicator of maturity . the biological background imputable to the piglet’s genetics has also been shown to impact survival  <cit> , for example, meishan piglets have a better survival rate than large white piglets although they are lighter at birth. moreover, herpin et al.  <cit>  highlighted that glucose homeostasis and body energy-glycogen storage are essential for survival.

glycogen is the main source of polysaccharide stored in cells  <cit> . glycogen storage is used to promote piglet thermoregulation at birth which takes place mainly in skeletal muscle  because of the absence of functional brown adipose tissue in piglets  <cit> . after birth, glycogen levels decrease by as much as 82% in muscle to provide the energy required  <cit> . proficient thermoregulation, via glycogen storage in muscle, is thus an essential prerequisite for survival after birth. thereby, the maturation of skeletal muscle metabolism is indicative of metabolic maturity of piglet at the time of birth  <cit> . the muscle maturity could be defined by an immediate efficient motor function but also by an effective thermogenesis.

some transcriptomic studies have already been performed to compare different stages of fetal muscle development in the pig. cagnazzo et al.  <cit>  compared seven prenatal stages  in two breeds  to highlight the differences in muscle development in these two breeds, while xu et al.  <cit>  compared a prenatal stage  with postnatal stages  to bring to light the mechanisms underlying muscle growth in meishan pigs. to our knowledge, no transcriptomic studies have yet been carried out on the last phases of fetal development in connection with maturity. here, we performed microarray analysis to describe the biological processes underlying muscle piglet maturity and identify candidate genes. the objective was to identify the genes and biological processes that are specifically involved in the differences in muscle development observed between two extreme breeds: large white and meishan. the large white  breed is a highly selected breed with a high rate of mortality at birth, whereas the chinese meishan  breed produces piglets with extremely low mortality  <cit> . the high selection in lw has led to a lower maturity of these piglets at birth  <cit> . ms and lw sows were inseminated with mixed semen . hence each litter was composed of purebred fetuses  and crossbred fetuses . in the present study, we highlight key genes and biological functions involved in piglet maturity. this analysis will help to improve our knowledge of maturity in the pig.

RESULTS
power of experimental design
microarray analysis was performed to study the last step of fetal development in the pig. muscle samples  were collected from  <dig> fetuses in  <dig> different conditions  at two gestational ages ). after normalization, the signal intensity was found to be above background noise for  <dig>  spots. principal component analysis  was carried out to evaluate microarray quality and observe fetus dispersion . principal component   <dig>  segregated fetuses according to gestational age  while pc  <dig>  separated fetuses according to genotype. the two groups of crossbred fetuses were mixed even with pc  <dig> . the results of this initial descriptive study, performed without preselecting spots, showing a clear separation between gestational ages and purebreds, demonstrate that the experimental design was very powerful.figure  <dig>

identification of differentially expressed genes
a mixed linear model was applied to each spot. this model involved two factors, gestational age and fetal genotype  as well as their interaction, and the sow as a random effect. the number of differentially expressed probes  was high even with a stringent correction for multiple tests ). indeed, a total of  <dig>  deps  were identified with a significance threshold of 1% with bonferroni correction. this large number could be explained by a large effect of fetal gestational age and the high power of the experimental design.

the list of  <dig>  deps was then partitioned into  <dig> sub-models using the bayesian information criterion . sub-model  <dig>  including 41% of the deps accounted for the largest proportion of deps, followed by sub-model  <dig>  with 40% of the deps. sub-model  <dig>  which included the genotype effect only, contained only 3% of the deps. sub-model  <dig> contained  <dig>  deps   and was particularly interesting because it combined the two factors of interest  and their interaction. this suggests that the last phase of the developmental process between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation is different across genotypes. it was therefore deemed that further analysis of this probe list would help to identify the biological processes involved in maturity.

ontological and functional biological analysis of differentially expressed genes
biological processes enriched during the maturation process
gene ontology  is a standard system of classification of gene product attributes in terms of their associated biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. sub-model  <dig> identified  <dig>  deps corresponding to  <dig>  unique annotated genes. go functional enrichment analysis was performed on two lists of genes from sub-model  <dig> using an absolute log2-fold change   between fetal gestational ages averaged over all genotypes. the first list contained  <dig> unique up-regulated genes at gestational day  <dig>  and the second list contained  <dig> unique up-regulated genes at day  <dig> . the top significant go annotations indicated that the enriched biological processes at  <dig> days of gestation were related to muscle development . cell adhesion or signal transduction as biological processes, extracellular matrix as cellular component and extracellular matrix structural constituent as molecular function were enriched at  <dig> days of gestation . at  <dig> days of gestation, the top significant enriched biological processes and molecular functions were generally involved in energy metabolism, e.g. gluconeogenesis, glucose metabolic process, cellular lipid metabolic process or oxidoreductase activity . enriched cellular components were linked, inter alia, to mitochondrion . all enriched go terms  are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> .figure  <dig>

differences of gene expression between gestational ages for each extreme fetal genotype 
the aim of this part of the study was to highlight the differences of maturation process observed between purebreds  and more particularly to identify genes that may explain the impaired maturity of lw piglets at birth. as above, go functional enrichment analysis was performed on the lists of genes from sub-model  <dig> using an absolute log2-fold change  between fetal gestational ages separately for fetuses of each breed . these genes were differentially expressed between the both gestational ages but not necessarily for every genotype. interestingly, more up-regulated genes were identified in ms than in lw for several enriched biological processes, e.g various metabolic processes at  <dig> days of gestation or muscle development at  <dig> days of gestation . another example was the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis kegg pathway . among seven enriched genes in this kegg pathway, pgk <dig> , pck <dig>  or ldha  were only up-regulated in ms at day  <dig> . these genes may illustrate the differences in the muscle maturation process between purebred ms and lw piglets.table  <dig>

differences between extreme fetal genotypes  with a relevance network approach
in contrast with bibliometric networks , a relevance network approach can use the transcriptomic information of both annotated and unannotated genes. influencial genes can be found by looking at degrees and betweeness centrality. the degree is the number of edges a gene, as a node, has to other genes. a gene with the highest degree is usually considered as a hub. betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a gene acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other genes. a relevance network between the  <dig>  unique genes  from sub-model  <dig> was built on pearson correlation r using a threshold of |r|> <dig> . it should be noted that with a lower threshold the resulting graph was too large and too highly connected to be interpreted . the largest connected component obtained was composed of  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges . nusap <dig>  was the gene with the highest degree, while cdk <dig>  was the gene with the highest betweenness centrality . by maximizing the modularity criterion, four communities were identified in this graph . according to functional enrichment analysis, each community was related to a particular biological function:  community  <dig> was involved in cell division and nucleus,  community  <dig> in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix,  community  <dig> in collagen, while  community  <dig> was involved in regulation of the fatty acid metabolism and oxidation-reduction process. detailed results  of enriched go analysis are presented in additional file  <dig>  genes belonging to communities  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  e.g. nusap <dig>  stmn <dig>  and col5a <dig>  chain), were mainly up-regulated at day  <dig>  with a higher expression in lw than in ms at day  <dig> . on the contrary, the genes of community  <dig>  e.g. dci  , were mainly up-regulated at day  <dig> with a higher expression in ms . the expression profiles of the relevance network highlighted a delay of gene expression in lw fetuses at  <dig> days of gestation.figure  <dig> 
largest connected component of the relevance network. each node in the graph represents a gene and each edge corresponds to a pearson correlation between two genes above the defined threshold . the size of each node is proportional to its degree. the graph included  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges. modularity was maximized to find communities in the graph. four communities were found and labelled with color . the percentages represent the number of genes in each community. for each community, we studied biological processes with go functional enrichment analysis. communities  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were mainly involved in muscle development, such as cell division, cell adhesion and collagen. community  <dig> was mainly involved in metabolism like the fatty acid one. all enriched go terms are detailed in the. unk stands for 'unknown’.

from a methodological point of view, it should be noted that a bias could have been introduced by the choice of the pearson correlation to represent the relationships between genes  <cit> . partial correlation, which discriminates between direct and indirect relationships, may have led to more relevant measurements of the direct dependence between variables  <cit> . however, in our study, the genes of interest were too numerous  and too highly correlated to compute partial correlations correctly.

taken together, the up- or down-regulation of the genes involved in these four communities was delayed at  <dig> days of gestation in lw fetuses compared with ms fetuses. these results are consistent with a lower maturity  of lw piglets at birth compared to ms piglets results section and additional file  <dig> 

influence of the paternal or maternal genome on gene expression
this experiment used a reciprocal design to independently evaluate the effect of each parental genome on the maturation process . in other words, if both genomes contributed to the same extent, as expected in the mendelian context, gene expression would be identical in the two sets of crossbred fetuses. however, the reality is that some genes are not regulated in the same manner depending on the origin of the allele. eight hundred and five probes were identified to be impacted by the parental genotype in interaction with gestational age . one hundred and six unique annotated genes  were influenced by the maternal genotype and  <dig> unique annotated genes  were influenced by the paternal genotype . it should be noted that  <dig> probes  influenced by the maternal genome were located on chromosome x versus  <dig> probes  influenced by the paternal genome. because only male fetuses were studied, all genes from the x chromosome were of maternal origin. moreover,  <dig> probes out of the  <dig> probes influenced by the maternal genome were located on mitochondrial chromosome.

several previously identified genes  were also influenced by a parental effect . for example, pck <dig> and ldha were impacted by the paternal genome as can be seen in the box-plots . other identified genes, such as sord  and crem , showed both a parental effect and a difference between purebred fetuses . crem expression was influenced by the maternal genotype, whereas sord expression was influenced by the paternal genotype . these genes illustrate the possible impact of the parental genotype on gene expression, and its effect on maturity.figure  <dig>

validation of differential expression by quantitative real time pcr
to validate the microarray results, the expression profiles of  <dig> genes of interest were monitored using qrt-pcr. the  <dig> selected genes showed differential expression for the two fixed effects and their interaction in the microarray . the similarity between the results obtained with the microarray and qrt-pcr confirmed the accuracy of gene expression measurements . indeed, the pearson correlation between the differences in expression measured by qrt-pcr and microarray was greater than  <dig>  for all genes, except il1rapl <dig> and spg <dig> . the high variability obtained by qpcr suggests that all genes were not highly correlated, especially in the lw sample at  <dig> days of gestation. nevertheless, the correlation obtained confirms our previous results and all the expression profiles are similar.table  <dig>

discussion
important transcriptomic changes between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation
the statistics chosen here to detect deps made no use of a minimum fold change filter. this choice was based on the complexity of the experimental design  making a fold change calculation difficult. moreover, no associated values indicate the level of confidence in the designation of genes as differentially expressed or not differentially expressed with such a fold change filter. a fold change filter was applied only at the point of gene function enrichment. the counterpart of this choice may be a potential for over-interpretation of data, by extracting genes with very small changes in expression. with a commonly-used threshold in fdr of 1%, as high as  <dig>  probes were found de, corresponding to 65% of expressed probes of the microarray. we chose instead a conservative cutoff of 1% with a bonferroni correction for multiple testing. a high number of deps  was obtained even with this stringent correction. this high number demonstrates, as does pca , that the choice of breeds and the two gestational ages were highly relevant in order to study contrasted situations linked to the maturation process. the important impact of genotype was expected in agreement with hazard et al.  <cit> , where 82% of the differentially expressed genes were impacted by the genotype, comparing lw and ms in another experimental context.

among these deps,  <dig>  probes  were influenced by the gestational age of fetus . pca of all expressed genes also showed the prime importance of fetal gestational age . this high number of deps related to gestational age, about 27% of the probes in the microarray, could be explained by a switch of gene expression between  <dig> days and  <dig> days of gestation. muscle development is described to end around  <dig> days of gestation  <cit> , and gives way to the maturation process in order for the organs and tissues to be functional at birth. in other words, for the fetus to be able to adapt to the extra-uterine environment, fetal tissues must have acquired complete functionality at birth.

using embryo transfers between two breeds , of the results published by wilson et al.  <cit>  and biensen et al.  <cit>  suggested that fetal development is determined by the uterine environment until  <dig> days of gestation, regardless of the fetal genotype. after  <dig> days of gestation, the last phase of fetal development is preferentially modulated by the fetal genotype with mechanisms specific to each genotype  <cit> . our experiment explored this final step of development in utero. we revealed the importance of the transition between fetal development and metabolism in muscle tissue for survival .

main biological mechanisms of maturity in pigs
to identify the biological processes underlying muscular maturity, functional enrichment analysis was performed on two gene lists from sub-model  <dig> , as well as their interaction, and the sow as random effect). the first list consisted of  <dig> up-regulated genes at day  <dig>  and the second consisted of  <dig> up-regulated genes at day  <dig>  these genes were chosen because of their interaction between the gestational age and the fetal genotype. we wanted to observe differences in the muscle maturation process between the both extreme breeds.

enriched biological functions at  <dig> days of gestation were involved in muscle development and reflected processes such as cell adhesion, signal transduction or skeletal muscle development . these results are consistent with the second phase of muscular development known to occur in pigs between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation  <cit> . in the pig, ontogenesis of muscle fibers is a biphasic phenomenon  <cit> . a first generation of myofibers develops between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation, followed by a second generation between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation. the second generation develops around each primary myotube using it as a scaffold and determines the number of myofibers  <cit> . the total number of myofibers is definitively fixed at approximately  <dig> days of gestation  <cit> . moreover, it has been reported that the number of myofibers is lower in ms than lw which may explain the small postnatal muscle growth capacity of ms pigs, in particular of large glycolytic muscle, e.g. longissimus muscle  <cit> .

among genes of sub-model  <dig> , the embryonic heavy chain isoform of myosin  is described to be only expressed between  <dig> days of gestation and birth  <cit> . in this study, while myh <dig> expression decreased in ms just before birth, its expression in lw stayed at a high level even at  <dig> days of gestation. it may correspond to the delay of variation of expression mainly observed between lw and ms at  <dig> days of gestation, suggesting a possible state of immaturity at birth as expected in lw. in another way, a variation of copy number of myh <dig> has been recently identified in cattle, that was positively correlated with its transcript expression and body traits   <cit> . it would be possible to imagine that selection on growth traits impacted polymorphisms in this gene, such as cnv . in our study, myh <dig> expression is eight fold higher in lw than in ms just before birth. further studies would be needed to explore the relationship between this possible delay of maturity in lw with the differential proportion of glycolitic myofiber observed between lw and ms . it was observed that comparison between lw and ms may suggest that intensive selection for lean muscle growth induced a shift in muscle metabolism toward a more glycolytic and less oxidative myofiber type  <cit> . however, it is not clear if a functional link may be proposed to explain an effect of the genetic difference of a higher expression of myh <dig> at birth with the metabolic status in longissimus dorsi muscle. in another way, the expression of pygm gene  was up-regulated at  <dig> days of gestation with a higher expression in ms  meaning a delayed expression in lw. a higher activity of the glycogen phosphorylase at protein level would illustrate a higher capacity to degrade the glycogen store at birth to produce energy.figure  <dig>

the pattern of muscle development was confirmed by the results of our relevance network in which the genes involved in development were up-regulated at  <dig> days of gestation. for example, nusap <dig>  the gene with the highest number of connections to other nodes  in our network, is a key gene for spindle microtubule organization and has been identified as playing a central role in regulating mitosis depending on its phosphorylation state  <cit> . the gene with the highest degree of relevance in community  <dig>  stmn <dig>  is also involved in the regulation of the microtubule filament system  <cit> . moreover, part of the collagen family was present and connected in community  <dig> . cdk <dig> is an important gene for two reasons: it has the highest betweeness centrality, indicative of its prime role in the structure of the network, and it links community  <dig>  with the remaining three communities . interestingly, cdk <dig> is up-regulated at  <dig> days, unlike genes of community  <dig>  this member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family regulates cell cycle progression and is involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle regeneration  <cit> . because these genes are down-regulated between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation, our results are in accordance with the previous hypothesis that muscle development “switches off” at around  <dig> days.

at  <dig> days of gestation, the enriched biological functions detected were involved in energy metabolism, especially in gluconeogenesis and cellular lipid processes . in contrast with intra-uterine life where fetal body temperature depends on the sow, autonomous thermoregulation must occur immediately upon birth for the piglet to survive  <cit> . energy reserves, i.e. glycogen and fat, must therefore be maximal in the neonatal period because the piglet cannot oxidize protein efficiently before 5- <dig> days of life  <cit> . in pig fetuses, glycogen is stored in skeletal muscle  and liver, because pigs lack brown adipose tissue  <cit> . the initial role of muscle glycogen, in addition to motor function, is postnatal thermogenesis, especially prior to colostrum intake. later, if energy intake is insufficient, the piglet draws down on its muscle glycogen reserves  <cit> . large amounts of glycogen are therefore stored in muscle before birth   <cit> . the genes of community  <dig> that were up-regulated at  <dig> days of gestation were involved in fatty acid metabolism which is also important for forming the body energy reserves required at birth  <cit> . dci, which was the gene with the highest degree of relevance in this community and the second betweenness centrality in our network, encodes a key mitochondrial enzyme involved in beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> .

globally, the process of muscle maturation was the same in each studied genotype: muscle fiber proliferation is switched off at around day  <dig>  and the enzymes coding genes for glycogen and lipid metabolism are up-regulated at around day  <dig> to ensure regulation of mechanisms essential for survival at birth. this is also in line with the changes in gene expression that have been reported at the end of gestation.

contrasted maturation process between extreme breeds
even if the overall muscle maturation process is the same for each genotype, some important differences were found between the extreme breeds that affected crucial biological processes . genes such as pgk <dig>  pck <dig> or ldha, encoding key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis kegg pathway, were up-regulated at day  <dig> in ms only . it should be noted that pck <dig> and ldha were down-regulated at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig> in lw . of special interest is pck <dig> that encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of oxaloacetate  to phosphoenolpyruvate , the rate-limiting step in the metabolic pathway that produces glucose from lactate and other precursors derived from the citric acid cycle  <cit> . this result may be surprising as gluconeogenesis is more often described to be a liver function than a property of muscle  <cit> .

body energy reserves, i.e. glycogen and fat, are important predisposing factors involved in the maturation process  <cit> . the fact that a piglet is unable to produce heat, may be the result of an immature metabolic capacity. a weaker expression of the genes  involved in these metabolic pathways between the two gestational ages may cause the lower maturity observed in lw, and therefore be responsible for the larger proportion of deaths at birth in this breed. moreover, muscle glycogen content has been already studied just before birth  <cit> . the animal’s requirement for energy is maximum in the neonatal period to promote thermoregulation and growth  <cit> . it strongly suggested that piglets with high value for survival, like ms, have a higher ability to maintain glucose levels during and after farrowing and are better able to maintain body temperature. for a long time, the storage and mobilization of the glycogen in muscle was known to be essential for survival at birth  <cit> .

genetic selection has been shown to alter genes which may be associated with marked differences in maturity between ms and lw  <cit> . canario et al.  <cit>  have already shown that selection for leanness in lw resulted in a lower maturity of piglets at birth, for example, with an effect on the body protein content and liver glycogen stores. genetic polymorphisms could affect the genes involved in these processes. for example, pgk <dig> showed a greater variability of expression in lw suggesting a possible underlying polymorphism in purebred lw fetuses . pck <dig> and ldha showed distinct expression profiles in ms and lw  .

in addition to the genes up-regulated at  <dig> days of gestation in ms pigs only, the lesser maturity of lw piglets could also be explained by a delay in gene expression at the end of the intra-uterine developmental period. as found with the relevance network approach , most genes in the communities involved in development were down-regulated just before birth, such as nusap <dig>  stmn <dig> or col5a <dig>  these genes had a higher expression in lw than in ms . most genes of community  <dig> , such as dci, were up-regulated at  <dig> days of gestation and the related genes were mainly expressed at a higher level in ms than in lw. our relevance network approach is therefore in accordance with the assumption that ms piglets are more mature than lw piglets. furthermore, the network may also provide information on unannotated genes by guilt-by-association. these results suggest that the genetic selection may affect genes involved in the muscle metabolic capacity confirming the initial assumption that ms newborns are more mature than the lw ones  <cit>  and enables us to suggest candidate genes for piglet maturity.

impact of the parental genotypes
we identified a great number of annotated genes  that were impacted by one of the two parental genotypes during maturation process:  <dig> genes were influenced by the maternal genotype and  <dig> genes by the paternal genotype . the influence of the parental genotype was found for several genes, such as crem and sord , which also showed difference between extreme breeds . some of these genes are known to be related to imprinting in pigs. many studies of genome scanning for qtl  in pigs revealed that many of them are maternally or paternally imprinted, which significantly affect growth, backfat thickness, carcass composition and reproduction  <cit> . among these genes, we identified igf <dig>   <cit>  and magel <dig>   <cit> . the selection pressure for enhancing lean meat content was described to be related to increase igf <dig> transcript expression in muscle  <cit> . the imprinting of the magel <dig> gene is highly conserved among species  <cit> . these results are consistent with the theory explaining parental conflict during gestation  <cit> . the parental genomes have a direct impact on fetal gene expression . the genetic component of piglet survival consists of a maternal genetic component  and a direct genetic component   <cit> . in this context, at the end of gestation, the paternal expression genes are up-regulated to allow the fetus to express its growth potential  <cit> . it has already been shown that paternally expressed genes are not essential for the initiation of fetal development  <cit> , but their role becomes more critical at the end of gestation.

moreover, these genes could play a key role in the maturation process. a large number of imprinted genes in humans are known to affect metabolic parameters such as glycogen metabolism  <cit> . for example, the expression of magel <dig>  known to have an effect on metabolic parameters and fetal growth  <cit> , is impacted by the paternal genotype in our study . this gene was up-regulated at  <dig> days of gestation and further up-regulated in paternal genotype ms. the ms paternal genotype therefore represents a strong genetic component for this gene’s expression. thus, the delay in the maturity of lw piglets may also be explained by differential impacts of the parental imprinting of some genes involved in metabolic processes. however, in our study, the relative involvement of each parental genome was studied only by comparison between the reciprocal crossed fetuses then no affirmation could be done on the imprinting status of the identified genes. allele specific expression could be investigated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
our experimental design was very powerful in order to unravel the biological processes underlying the last phase of muscle development, and identify key muscle differences between lw and ms pigs that could explain lesser maturity of lw piglets at birth. biological functions and genes involved in maturity have been identified in each breed. this study shows that a considerable transcriptomic change occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> days of gestation, and corresponds to a switch between muscle development and muscle metabolism. this study also highlighted genes with differences of expression between extreme breeds lw and ms, such as pck <dig>  pgk <dig> and ldha. these genes play roles in the implementation of the muscle metabolic processes necessary for thermoregulation at birth. these processes are also under the conflicting regulation of the two parental genomes with a predominance of the paternal genotype which affects genes such as magel <dig> and igf <dig>  these results are a first step in understanding the global system biology of piglet maturity. some genes described in this report could be candidates to explore the genetic control of maturity. futher functional and genetical studies may be focused on the lw breed with its increased mortality at birth, and then be continued to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying the differences in maturity.
