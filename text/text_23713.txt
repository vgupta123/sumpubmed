BACKGROUND
physalis peruviana, also known as cape gooseberry is a tropical fruit from the solanaceae family, which includes many agriculturally important crops including potato, tomato, pepper, eggplant and tobacco  <cit> . the cape gooseberry fruit contains high levels of vitamin a, c and b-complex, as well as compounds of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties  <cit> . supercritical carbon dioxide extracts of p. peruviana leaves were shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human lung cancer h <dig> cells  <cit> . recently, 4β-hydroxywithanolide  isolated from p. peruviana aerial parts  was demonstrated to be a potential dna-damaging and chemotherapeutic agent against lung cancer  <cit> . in colombia, this fruit has become promissory with high demand in european markets, mainly due to its unique taste, attractive color and shape as well as its potential health value. p. peruviana is a source of health related compounds found in the fruit and other parts of the plant including leaves and steams. despite its nutritional and medical importance, current absence of p. peruviana genetic and genomic resources makes in-depth molecular studies on the plant difficult. until this study, there were only a few partial p. peruviana gene sequences in public databases, mainly as a result of phylogenetic studies in the solanaceae family  <cit> . therefore, there is a pressing need for efforts to obtain global genetic and genomic information from the cape gooseberry, p. peruviana.

advances in next generation sequencing  technology over the past few years have made it possible to rapidly perform de novo transcriptome and even genome assembly for non-model organisms with no or little prior genomic data available  <cit>  . however, polyploidy and the large size of many plant genomes, which is predominantly due to amplification of repetitive elements or sometimes partial genome duplication  <cit> , pose challenges to de novo whole genome assembly of plants. as such, est sequencing, which avoids non-coding and repetitive dna components, is a cost-effective and commonly used strategy to analyze the transcribed portion of a genome. availability of ests represent a valuable resource for research as they provide comprehensive information regarding the transcriptome facilitating gene discovery and genome annotation and aiding in the determination of phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . an increasing number of successful studies have been published describing est sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for large-scale gene discovery  <cit> .

here we describe the sequencing and assembly of the first p. peruviana leaf transcriptome from its cdna-derived ests using the  <dig> gs-flx titanium technology, as well as in silico functional annotation and gene model prediction of the assembled transcriptome. the overall workflow of the project is represented in figure  <dig>  this first transcriptome draft will provide valuable resources for the development of molecular genetic tools that can be used in agronomic trait related marker discoveries, in addition to studies that aim to solve phytosanitary, fruit quality and production problems.

RESULTS
est sequencing and assembly
we performed three fourths  <dig> gs flx titanium run on one normalized cdna library constructed from p. peruviana leaf tissue, generating approximately  <dig> mbp of sequence data from  <dig>  reads with an average length of 375 bp . after a trimming process by seqclean  <cit> , which removes adaptors, primer sequences, poly-a tails, as well as short, longer and low quality sequences, a total of  <dig>  high quality reads were obtained with an average length of 371 bp. de novo transcriptome assembly was performed using newbler  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , which has been shown to perform better than a number of other commonly used assemblers  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the transcriptome sequencing and assembly statistics,  <dig> % of the reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs, and then further into  <dig>  isotigs, with an average assembled length of  <dig>  bp. the isotig n <dig> length was  <dig>  bp. all isotigs that share common contigs belong to the same isogroup, presumably equivalent to one gene locus containing multiple alternatively spliced transcripts. the  <dig>  assembled isotigs are part of  <dig>  isogroups , among which  <dig>  isogroups have only one isotig each. isotigs whose length exceeded 200 bp  were kept for further analysis. the remaining  <dig> % reads are singletons, which cannot be connected with any other reads. the  <dig>  singletons were kept for further analysis. the average coverage of assembled isotigs is estimated to be  <dig> x. the number goes down to  <dig> x if we include all the singletons as the effective transcribed portion. isotigs and singletons together will be referred as cdnas in the rest the manuscript. the raw data files are available at the national center for biotechnology information  sequence read archive  accession number srp <dig>  the assembled reads were deposited in the transcriptome shotgun assembly  database .

functional annotation
as the first step for assigning putative functions to the p. peruviana transcriptome, blastx searches  <cit>  were used to align the cdnas to the uniprotkb/swiss-prot and ncbi refseq databases. a total of  <dig>  isotigs and  <dig>  singletons had a blast hit  to known proteins and matched  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique protein accessions, respectively. more than 99% of the blastx hits from both isotigs and singletons were from plant proteins. compared to isotigs, a much greater percentage of singletons do not have any significant hits , which could be mainly due to their short lengths. using blast2go  <cit> , we retrieved gene ontology  terms and enzyme commission numbers  for the p. peruviana cdnas  from the blastx output described above. a total of  <dig>  go terms were assigned to  <dig>  cdnas . among all the go terms extracted,  <dig>   belong to the molecular function class,  <dig>   to biological process class and  <dig>   to cellular component class. there are  <dig>  cdnas assigned to multiple go terms.

the biological process  go category comprise different types of metabolic processes which are the most represented categories: there are  <dig>  sequences associated with metabolic processes , which is expected, since the metabolic network in plants is by far more extensive compared to other organisms  <cit> . we found go terms associated with primary metabolites, which include the universal building blocks of sugars, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and energy sources that are essential for plant survival. additionally, we found go terms associated with secondary metabolites that play key roles in maintaining plant fitness including ones that function in the protection of plants against microbial, viral infections and uv radiation. shown in figure  <dig> are a number of go terms  that are abundant and relevant to plant physiology, like the metabolic processes of nitrogen compound, nucleotide, carbohydrate, amine and phosphorus. another category worthy to mention is “response to stimulus” . we found  <dig>  sequences associated with this category, which include candidate genes for resistance to pathogen attacks. shown in figure  <dig> are a number of level  <dig> go categories including: response to organic substance, defense response and response to hormone stimulus. in the molecular function  category, 30% of the p. peruviana cdnas have high similarity to proteins with transferase or hydrolase activity  that includes genes associated with secondary metabolic synthesis pathways  <cit> . other abundant level  <dig> mf categories include: nucleotide binding, ion binding and oxidoreductase binding .

we were able to assign  <dig> unique enzyme commission  numbers to  <dig>  p. peruviana cdnas, where  <dig> unique ec numbers were in turn assigned to  <dig> metabolic pathways linked to  <dig>  cdnas . we found  <dig> cdnas involved in thiamine metabolism in addition to  <dig> sequences associated with secondary metabolite biosynthesis and  <dig> assigned to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. these pathways are of particular interest in physalis as thiamine has been known to induce defense response in plants through the salicylic acid and ca2+-related signaling pathways  <cit>  and may play roles in biotic or abiotic stress  <cit> . furthermore, secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids play important roles in resistance mechanisms to pathogens and recently have also been used in medicinal applications including antioxidants, anticancer and anti-inflammatories  <cit> .

protein domains encoded by the p. peruviana leaf transcriptome
a total of  <dig>  p. peruviana cdnas were found to have significant similarities to  <dig>  protein domains present in the ncbi cdd   <cit> . the most abundant domain present in proteins encoded by the p. peruviana transcriptome is the pentatricopeptide repeat domain , found in  <dig> cdnas. the ppr containing proteins are commonly found in the plant kingdom and although its function is still unclear, the ppr domain has been found in proteins involved in rna editing in a number of recent studies  <cit> . following the ppr domain, the next three most commonly found domains in the p. peruviana transcriptome are: protein kinase domain , nb-arc domain  and wd <dig> domain . protein kinases are one of the largest protein families in plants, involved in a wide variety of physiological processes  <cit> , like calcium-dependent protein kinases and map kinases which are involved in the recognition of elicitors or pathogens and the subsequent activation of defense response in plants  <cit> . the nb-arc domain is a nucleotide-binding motif shared by plant resistant gene products involved in regulated cell death  <cit> . the wd <dig> domain, whose common function is coordinating multi-protein complex assemblies, is found in a large number of eukaryotic proteins that cover a wide variety of functions including adaptor and regulatory modules in signal transduction, pre-mrna processing and cytoskeleton assembly  <cit> . additionally, the wd <dig> domain is critically involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway which regulates photomorphogenesis, flowering and abiotic stress response in plants  <cit> .

other frequently found domains include: rna recognition motif , ring-finger domain , leucine rich repeat n-terminal domain , tyrosine kinase catalytic domain , all of which are commonly found in eukaryotic cells and involved in a broad range of biological processes. the data is summarized in table  <dig> 

*cdd: conserved domain database.

out of the  <dig>  singletons, there are  <dig>  of them  where go term were assigned to the sequence through blast2go  or where a significant similarity to a well-characterized protein domain from ncbi cdd was found. we deposited the  <dig>  singletons described above, in addition to the  <dig>  assembled isotigs in the ncbi’s tsa  sequence database, which is available at genbank . those sequences with their functional annotations, including go terms and domain similarity related description, are also provided as additional file 1: ‘cape gooseberry cdnas’.

in silico ssr marker identification
the presence of simple sequence repeats  in the p. peruviana transcriptome was identified in silico using phobos  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  ssr loci were found in the cape gooseberry cdnas, where imperfect motifs were the most abundant , in contrast to  <dig> loci representing perfect motifs . microsatellites were searched in cdnas avoiding redundant results in isotigs, considering that searching in the alternative transcripts could lead us to predict the same ssrs in different isotigs corresponding to the same isogroup. trinucleotide  and hexanucleotide  motifs were the most commonly found repetitions in the p. peruviana leaf transcriptome, accounting for 68% of the ssrs identified, in contrast to other plant studies where tri- and dinucleotides were the most commonly found repeat units  <cit> .

we recently reported the first set of microsatellite markers developed for p. peruviana and related species  <cit>  where the large majority of ssr loci was found in untranslated regions  of transcripts with similarity to known proteins in public databases, leading to the identification of two novel polymorphic ssrs related to proteins involved in pathogen defense response. ssrs prioritization for plant breeding programs can be done via functional annotation of cdnas associated with predicted ssrs and gene ontology annotations like ones involved in plant defense. here we used and updated functional annotation of the transcriptome and the entire collection of assembled transcripts to report ten novel predictions for cdna-derived ssrs in cape gooseberry. these ssrs are associated with proteins with gene ontology annotations involved in plant defense to biotic stress such as defense response to fungus, programmed cell death, callose deposition in cell wall during defense response, plant hypersensitive response, and jasmonic acid, ethylene and salicylic acid hormones . the srrs obtained in this study are the raw materials for future studies in genetic variation among physalis populations, which can be used for: construction of genetic maps, quantitative trait loci  identification in this species and plant breeding programs focused on phytosanitary cape gooseberry problems.

gene model prediction in p. peruviana
the genome of p. peruviana has not been sequenced yet, nevertheless it is possible to generate gene model predictions using the p. peruviana transcriptome and the genomes of solanum lycopersicum  or solanum tuberosum , which are the two closest related species that have genome sequence available  <cit> . the cdna to genomic dna alignments were generated using the splign software package  <cit>  as described in methods. all the assembled transcripts through the previous steps including  <dig>  isotigs and  <dig>  singletons, were mapped to the s. lycopersicum genome, resulting in  <dig>   aligned cdnas, representing  <dig>  gene loci and  <dig>  transcript models. on the other hand,  <dig>   p. peruviana cdnas were mapped to the s. tuberosum genome, representing  <dig>  gene loci and  <dig>  transcript models, as summarized in table  <dig>  splign requires the consensus intron sequences  at the splice sites; therefore strand orientation for the multiple-exon alignments from the splign output can be decided by the 4-nucleotide sequences at the two intron ends. at the moment, no strand orientation is assigned to single exon transcripts, as the query sequence gets aligned to a continuous region in the genome, unless there is strong polyadenylation signal.

the majority of aligned exons have an identity with the genomic sequence ranging from 70% to 95%, with an average identity of  <dig> %. figure  <dig> shows a number of features of the gene models from alignments of p. peruviana to s. tuberosum genome. most of gene models contain less than  <dig> exons. the longest one has  <dig> exons. the average length of the aligned exons is  <dig> base pairs and that of the intron is  <dig>  base pairs. the intron-exon boundaries as predicted by cdna to genome alignments are highly conserved when both the s. tuberosum and s. lycopersicum genomes are used to align the p. peruviana transcriptome. we have generated general feature format  files for the gene models .

further examination of the gene models revealed that there are  <dig>  p. peruviana cdnas mapped to both s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum genome as shown in figure  <dig> , among which  <dig>  cdnas have multiple-exon gene models on both genomes .  <dig>   multiple-exon cdnas have at least one intron occuring at exactly the same position on the cdna when aligned to the s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum genomes . furthermore, there are  <dig>  cdnas having exactly the same set of intron positions on the cdna when mapped to the two genomes . however, for those intron positions that have the same coordinates in the cdna when mapped to the two genomes, the length and thus the sequence of corresponding introns in the gene models from the two genomes have large variances, as revealed in figure  <dig> b.

intron length variation is exemplified in figure 5c, where a p. peruviana cdna  was mapped to both the s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum genomes, resulting in two identical sets of exons, but different sets of intron lengths . there is also a number of s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum cdnas that have the same predicted gene model in their own genome, respectively . figure 5c  shows the nucleotide sequences around the first intron site of the  <dig> cdnas from p. peruviana, s. tuberosum and s. lycopersicum. primers targeting conserved flanking exonic regions as indicated can be used to amplify intronic fragments from all three species, p. peruviana, s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum.

the conserved orthologous set  markers are sets of genes conserved throughout evolution in both sequence and copy number  <cit>  that have been used extensively in comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies in solanaceae. the cos marker strategy involves design of universal exonic primers among closely related species based on ortholog identification and multiple sequence alignment to amplify intronic/exonic regions. in the present study, we present another convenient approach to find universal exon regions - gene model prediction by splign using two or more related genomes to define common models. given the fact that the p. peruviana genome is not available yet, and genomes of both s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum are only in their initial versions, gene model predictions would be particularly valuable in obtaining specific intronic regions for marker and snp discovery in non-model species, as well as for comparative genomic and phylogenetic studies.

we also aligned the s. lycopersicum transcriptome to its own genome  and also to the s. tuberosum genome  <cit>  using splign. we mapped  <dig>  from a total of  <dig>  s. lycopersicum cdnas to its own genome with 100% identity . however, only  <dig>   s. lycopersicum cdnas can be mapped to s. tuberosum genome with an average identity of 90%. in the cape gooseberry case only  <dig> % p. peruviana cdnas get mapped to the s. tuberosum genome, suggesting that p. peruviana is evolutionarily more distant from s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum than the two species from each other. we then conducted further analysis to estimate the phylogenetic location of p. peruviana in the solanaceae family.

experimental validation of intron positions
the experimental validation of predicted exon/intron boundaries in the assembled cdnas was carried out in a small sample of cdnas, which are putative homologous of plant disease resistance genes and can be mapped to both the potato and tomato genomes. for each of these cdnas, a pair of cosii primers was designed to span one putative intron  for pcr amplification of the genomic dna. the information of the primers used is summarized in table  <dig>  all the amplified pcr products had the expected length and then were sequenced using conventional sanger sequencing. comparison of the amplified genomic fragments to their corresponding cdnas revealed that all the eight samples we sequenced indeed showed the exon/intron boundaries consistent with the gene models predicted by splign. three of them had the experimentally identified intron positions exactly the same as the predicted. in the other five samples, the predicted intron positions are a few base pairs  away from the experimentally identified sites. the results are shown in table  <dig>

phylogenetic relationship of p. peruviana with other solanaceae species
we found five putative orthologs among p. peruviana, s. lycopersicum, s. tuberosum, capsicum spp , s. melongena  and petunia spp. the proteins are: xyloglucanase inhibitor containing pepsin_retropepsin superfamily domain, mitochondrial catalytic protein containing pp2cc superfamily domain, mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit protein containing rps <dig> superfamily domain, phosphate transporter and a functionally unknown protein.

to obtain the best accuracy of the phylogenetic tree to be built, we compared the five putative orthologous proteins to the ncbi’s plant refseq protein database. there are seven other species that have blast hits with an expect value < 1e- <dig> to all the five orthologs from the previous steps. these seven species are: arabidopsis thalianapopulus trichocarpa , ricinus communis , vitis vinifera , oryza sativa , zea mays  and sorghum bicolor, none of which belongs to the solanaceae family. the phylogenetic tree was constructed between thirteen plants using the software phyml  <cit>  and mega  <cit> . the tree generated has good bootstrapping support at all of the branch points except for the position of v. vinifera. we removed the v. vinifera sequence and constructed the tree presented in figure  <dig> 

the phylogenetic relationship among s. lycopersicums. tuberosumcapsicum spps. melongena and petunia spp is consistent with a previous study by wang y et al.  <cit> , in which the tree was constructed based on an unduplicated conserved syntenic segment in the genomes of the five plants. our results showed that p. peruviana branched out before the divergence of the other five solanaceae family members. details of the phylogenetic analysis are summarized in additional file 5: ‘phylogenetic analysis workflow’.

CONCLUSIONS
this report constitutes the first genomic resource for the physalis genus providing a large collection of assembled and functionally annotated cdnas. the physalis genus is part of the solanaceae family, whose members are important sources of food, spice and medicine. however, genomic data for other members of the physalis genus is limited. therefore, this resource will enhance comparative studies within the family and the transcriptome will serve as a starting point for gene discovery in physalis and for future annotations of the physalis peruviana genome sequence. a number of the genes identified in this study provide candidates for resistance genes against viruses, fungal or bacterial pathogens. additionally, this study is a potentially invaluable resource for mapping and marker-assisted breeding in physalis peruviana and closely related species like physalis philadelphica, commonly known as tomatillo, which are food staples in central american countries.
