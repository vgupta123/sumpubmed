BACKGROUND
streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus , which belongs to lancefield group c streptococci, is an important animal pathogen, especially in horse  <cit> . it has a broad host spectrum and occasionally infects humans. human infections may occur following ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy products  <cit> , or after contact with pigs  <cit> . in china, s. zooepidemicus is the main pig pathogen. in the summer of  <dig>  a s. zooepidemicus disease outbreak occurred among pigs in the sichuan province, china. clinical symptoms of the diseased pigs included painful swelling of the joints, respiratory disturbances, and diarrhea. more than  <dig>  pigs died within two weeks. according to bacteriological examinations, s. zooepidemicus was isolated from most of the diseased pigs, and it appeared to be one of the major causative agents  <cit> .

m protein is an important virulence factor of group a streptococci: this fibrillar, surface-exposed protein deters opsonization of the organism using the alternate complement pathway  <cit> . strains of group a streptococci expressing m protein are resistant to phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, whereas strains that fail to express m protein are avirulent  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated that s. zooepidemicus carry antigens with characteristics of the antiphagocytic m protein of the lancefield group a and g streptococci; it was named m-like protein   <cit> . cloning of the gene encoding szp from an equine strain of subsp. zooepidemicus revealed a single open reading frame of  <dig>  bp  <cit> , whereas the szp gene  from a pig strain of subsp. zooepidemicus showed a single open reading frame of  <dig>  bp   <cit> .

similar to other streptococcal species, s. zooepidemicus binds to a number of host proteins, including immunoglobulin g  <cit> , serum albumin  <cit> , fibronectin, collagen  <cit> , and α-macro-globulin  <cit>  through cell surface components. these host-parasite recognition components may function as virulence factors by acting as adhesions or antiopsonins. bacterial adhesion to the host cell is the first step in bacterial infection. the m protein of streptococcus group a is an adhesin that can bind to the host cell, however it is not known whether the szp of s. zooepidemicus also functions as an adhesion, and the adhesion mechanism of szp binding to host cell is unclear. here, we report the adhesive function of the szp to human hep- <dig> epithelial cells. furthermore, we identified several immunodominant mimic epitopes of szp using random peptide phage library in combination with elisa and binding-inhibition assays. alignment of the phage display peptides yielded a conserved motif, xslsrx, which represents an immunodominant mimic epitope of the szp of s. zooepidemicus strain atcc  <dig> and may mediate binding to hep- <dig> cells.

RESULTS
molecular characterization of m-like protein
nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a single open reading frame in the szp gene of s. zooepidemicus atcc  <dig> isolated from pigs; translation of this open reading frame revealed a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the szp gene showed  <dig> % homology at the nucleotide level with the szp gene of s. zooepidemicus w <dig> strain isolated from the horse, and  <dig> % homology with the m protein gene of group a streptococci  <cit> . expression of the mature szp gene under the control of the t <dig> promoter sequence was achieved with high yield and purity . sds-page analysis demonstrated that the recombinant protein was  <dig> kda, and was confirmed to be szp by immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti- s. zooepidemicus antibody.

binding of rszp to hep- <dig> host cells
the binding of purified rszp to hep- <dig> monolayers was assessed by elisa. purified rszp exhibited significant, dose-dependent binding to hep- <dig> cells, whereas binding of the negative control, fetuin, was negligible . adherence inhibition assays were used to determine the ability of anti-szp antibodies to inhibit adherence of s. zooepidemicus to hep- <dig> cells. biotinylated s. zooepidemicus intact cells were first pretreated with the anti- szp polyclonal/monoclonal antibodies and were then tested for the ability to bind hep- <dig> monolayers. pretreatment of biotinylated s. zooepidemicus with increasing amounts of anti- szp polyclonal antibodies resulted in a significant  dose-dependent inhibition of bacterial adherence  . no significant difference  was observed in the adherence of normal serum-treated bacteria to hep- <dig> cells . out of the  <dig> monoclonal antibodies,only 2c <dig> was able to inhibit the adherence of s. zooepidemicus to hep- <dig> cells .

biopanning
the anti-szp monoclonal antibody 2c <dig> was immobilized onto microtiter wells to pan mimic epitopes from random 12-mer peptides library during five successive rounds of selection. the productivities of the target phages for the first and the fifth biopanning were  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively, and false positive rates were reduced from  <dig>  to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. taken together, these values indicate a significant enrichment of the selected phages.

specificity analysis
elisa was used to confirm that the phage-displayed peptides were specifically recognized by mab 2c8; normal antiserum was used as a negative control. a phage was considered to be specifically bound by mab 2c <dig> when  >  <dig> , where aa and ab correspond to the absorbance of the phage binding to 2c <dig> mab and normal antiserum, respectively. based on these criteria,  <dig> phage colonies were positive in a sandwich elisa assay  and were propagated for inhibition experiments.

inhibition experiments
competitive inhibition experiments were performed to determine whether the selected phages contained the same or mimic epitopes of the szp. the results showed that ten of the fourteen clones  displayed an inhibition level of greater than 40% by mab 2c <dig> . these results demonstrated that each selected phage contained a binding site to the mab, that the binding sites of the phage-displayed peptides are szp-specific, and that they may function as immunodominant mimics of the szp .

characterization of positive selected phage clones
ten phages that showed specific binding were selected from an initial  <dig> phages and sent for sequencing. sequencing of the phage inserts revealed that four out of the  <dig> phages displayed kslsrhdhihhh, one phage displayed sslsrgkpsrp, one phage displayed sslspqrhsypa, and only one phage  showed no similarity to either peptide sequence . alignment using the dnastar-megalign software showed that the motif xslsrx was conserved among them.

discussion
m protein is composed of two predominantly alpha-helical protein chains assembled in a coiled-coil that extends from the bacterial cell surface  <cit> . the m protein c terminus, which is anchored to the cell membrane and traverses the cell wall, is highly conserved, whereas the n terminus, which contacts the external environment, is highly variable and accounts for the type specificity. there are more than  <dig> known m protein serotypes of group a streptococci, and the serotype specificity is largely determined by epitopes located in the n-terminal  <dig> to  <dig> residues  <cit> . szp is similar in structure to m protein of group a streptococci. in addition to s. zooepidemicus, szp have also been detected in other group c and g streptococci  <cit> . szp elicited protective antibodies and impaired deposition of c <dig> on the bacterial surface  <cit> . szp gene has also been cloned from s. zooepidemicus  <cit> . the predicted amino acid structure contains an alpha-helical repeat and shows highly homology to the c terminus of m proteins of group a, however the extensive a, b, c repeat regions found in m proteins of group a are absent. when compared to the szp of s. zooepidemicus equine strain w <dig>  the following n-terminal residues differ: s27g, s28v, v30a, and a32s; all of the swine strains shared the same signal peptide. the c terminus of szp of s. zooepidemicus is rich in proline residues, and is composed primarily of pepk repeats. the known swine strains shared  <dig> pepk repeats with the szp, whereas the equine strain w <dig> shared only  <dig> pepk repeats  <cit> .

bacterial attachment to a host tissue is often the first step leading to colonization and the development of an infectious disease. the bacteria are dependent on their own surface components, called "adhesins", for binding in a stereochemical manner to complementary molecules on the host tissue surface. most bacterial adhesins are proteins, and they are frequently contained in filamentous surface appendages known as fimbriae or pili  <cit> . streptococcal survival in the host depends on the m protein, which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes  <cit> . bacterial strains that express high levels of m protein have been reported to adhere to human epithelial cells in significantly higher numbers than m protein-deficient strains, suggesting that this molecule also plays a critical role in adherence to human tissue  <cit> . the present study has shown that rszp can attach to hep- <dig> cells in a manner inhibited by both anti-rszp antibodies and by anti-s. zooepidemicus antibodies, suggesting that the szp is a putative adhesin of s. zooepidemicus, which may contribute to the colonization in vivo.

recent investigations have successfully employed phage display libraries to identify specific ligands for antibodies, enzymes, cell surface receptors, drugs, and epitopes  <cit> . furthermore, studies have demonstrated that some selected ligands do not necessarily resemble the natural ligand, but instead mimic their binding properties  <cit> . in view of this, peptide phage libraries may be used as a rapid and convenient method for selecting "novel" peptide epitopes regardless of whether their displayed peptide sequences are homologous to the natural antigen, and may thereby serve as ideal candidates in vaccine development  <cit> . the potential for use of random peptide phage display libraries in defining specificities of mabs has been demonstrated successfully  <cit> . in the present study, following five rounds of enrichment,  <dig> positive phage clones had higher binding capacity, indicating that the ligands had been selected successfully. inhibition assays were used to assess whether ligands obtained in this study mimicked the szp. results showed that  <dig> phage clones effectively inhibited mab 2c <dig> binding to rszp. the motif xslsrx was identified as highly conserved among these peptides. we believe that these findings will be helpful in clarifying the pathogenic mechanism of s. zooepidemicus. however, we did not find similar motifs in the szp. thus, the xslsrx motif might act as a mimic epitope. future studies are needed to address whether the xslsrx epitope may be discontinuous.

CONCLUSIONS
the investigation provided strong evidence that the m-like protein of streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus strain atcc  <dig> was an adhesin. the motif xslsrx may represent an immunodominant mimic epitope of m-like protein, and that the same epitope may be used to mediate m-like protein binding to hep- <dig> cells.
