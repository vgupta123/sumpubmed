BACKGROUND
the acidic mammalian fibroblast growth factor  and the basic fibroblast growth factor  bind to heparin decasaccharide and to domains of their tyrosine membrane spanning kinase receptor  <cit> . fgf is a powerful mitogen in many mammalian cell types. however its major importance is to switch endothelial cell growth to angiogenesis  and to development of tumors  <cit> .

depending on the cell growth substrate fgf either stimulates endothelial cell growth or promotes capillary differentiation. extensive cell spreading and growth were stimulated when the culture dishes were pre-coated with a high density of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin  whereas lower coating densities  resulted in cell shortening, cessation of growth and tube formation. coating with different concentrations of type iv collagen or gelatin resulted in similar switches.

it is now recognized that oncogene induced excessive tumor cell proliferation is insufficient to produce a lethal tumor but requires simultaneous angiogenesis  <cit> . tumor cell proliferation alone without angiogenesis frequently gives rise to dormant, microscopic tumors. the latter can be reactivated by increased angiogenic activity unless there is a permanent inhibition of this activity by endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. therefore there is interest in the efficient and cost effective production of recombinant fgfs for experiments in these areas.

in general, there are two major strategies for production of recombinant proteins of agricultural, nutritional or medical interest from genes introduced into plants: stable transformation and transient expression. transient expression has a number of advantages over stable transformation  <cit> . simple manipulation, rapid analysis and high expression efficiency are possible. primarily it avoids the extensive isolation, complex safety regulations and bureaucracy connected with growing stable transformed plants in the field. previously tobacco, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and indica or japonica rice have been employed as transient expression hosts  <cit> . in addition some legume species such as alfalfa have been successfully used for production of monoclonal antibodies and blood substitutes  <cit> . intact leaf vacuum system for transient expression of recombinant proteins by agrobacterium was applied in  <dig> to phaseolus acutifolius, phaseolus vulgaris, poplar and tobacco  <cit> . the vacuum was exerted on detached leaves and the plant materials were difficult to preserve fresh after inoculation. however, the transformation of other legume crops have been difficult and there is only one previous report of transient expression of recombinant proteins of medical or industrial interest in peas. green et al. used this method to express three therapeutic proteins: hgh, hawy <dig>  and lickm-pad <dig> in pisum sativum  varieties, the plants were grown for 7- <dig> days before vacuum infiltration  <cit> . we have used pea here and converted the pea early browning virus  virus induced gene silencing system  to an efficient agroinfection system  <cit> . pebv belongs to the tobacco rattle virus genus, which has provided efficient silencing vectors for tobacco and tomato  <cit> . pebv is a rod-shaped virus with a bipartite rna genome  <cit> . the rna <dig> molecule encodes all proteins required for replication and movement of the virus and can infect plants without rna <dig>  rna <dig> encodes the viral coat protein and proteins needed for nematode transmission. pebv has been modified into binary expression vectors for agrobacterium transformation by inserting the expression cassettes of rna <dig> and rna <dig> between the right and left t-dna borders of cambia  <dig> derived plasmids. transcriptional control is exerted by a cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter and a nopaline syntase  terminator. plasmid pcape <dig> contains the full-length cdna of pebv rna <dig> with an intron inserted to stabilize the plasmid in bacteria. plasmid pcape2-gfp contains the cdna of pebv rna <dig> with the green fluorescent protein  coding sequence under the control of the coat protein promoter replacing the genes required for nematode transmission. alternatively the genes for nematode transmission are replaced with the gene whose expression is desired, in casu the gene encoding human fibroblast growth factor. the two agrobacterium strains with these two plasmids are mixed and the mixture delivered into the leaves with a syringe.  the plant rna polymerase transcribes the full length cdna of pebv rna <dig> including the encoded viral rna polymerase from the t-dna chromosomal insertions  transcription and translation of the rna <dig> related genes permit the assembly of the viral components that spread the virus throughout the plant.  the plant rna polymerase transcribes simultaneously the pcape <dig> t-dna chromosomal insertion encoding the virus coat protein and the targeted transgene. translation provides the two proteins in the cells, i.e the desired recombinant protein and virus particles both spread throughout the plant.

several different methods have been used to inoculate agrobacterium into plants. leaf injection is an effective way to introduce agrobacterium containing genes of interest into plant leaves. we have previously used this method to express the human acidic fibroblast growth factor  in tobacco leaves  <cit> . but leaf injection is laborious, and requires repeated injection of each plant leaf. therefore leaf vacuum infiltration has been used for expression of Î²-glucuronidase in phaseolus vulgaris  <cit>  and for synthesis of tumor-specific single-chain and chimerical antibodies in tobacco leaves  <cit> . vacuum infiltration has also been used to express an active human beta-interferon in lettuce and to transform lentil cotyledonary nodes and wheat inflorescence tissues  <cit> .

we present here a useful transient plant expression system for recombinant proteins in pea plants by vacuum infiltration of germinating seeds with two agrobacterium strains carrying the pcape <dig> and pcape2-gfp or pcape2-afgf plasmid, respectively. using gfp as reporter conditions were optimized and the procedure applied to synthesise human acidic fibroblast growth factor  in pea plants. western blot analyses confirmed the production of afgf and a bioassay of mitogenic activity demonstrated that the purified recombinant afgf was active in stimulating the growth of nih 3t <dig> cells.

RESULTS
vacuum infiltration system for germinated pea seeds
pea seeds with 2- <dig> cm roots  were exposed to a solution of agrobacterium containing gfp encoding t-dna at a density of od <dig> =  <dig> - <dig>  and to a vacuum of  <dig>  mpa for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> min. at 8- <dig> dpi gfp fluorescence was observed. the spreading of fluorescence into newly formed leaves continued for  <dig> days when the plants were harvested and gfp expression was analyzed. the result indicated that the frequency of gfp expressing plants was independent of the times of vacuum treatment . one min vacuum treatment was adopted for the following tests.

vacuum pressure treatments were performed at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mpa using a cell density od <dig> =  <dig> - <dig> , and a evacuation time of one min. the frequency of gfp expressing plants was  <dig>  5%, 38% and 82% at pressures of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mpa  respectively, indicating that the vacuum pressure was a key factor for successful agroinfection. the highest number of transient expressing gfp plants were observed with the highest vacuum pressure tested . no gfp-positive plants were obtained at  <dig>  mpa.

to determine if wounding affected the inoculation, germinated seeds with root wounding or with intact roots were immersed in agrobacterium suspensions  and vacuum applied for  <dig> min at  <dig>  mpa vacuum pressure. the frequency of gfp expressing was  <dig> % and  <dig> % in plants inoculated with and without root wounding indicating that wounding did not affect the induction of gfp expression .

our data indicated that bacterium suspension density was another important factor influencing the frequency of induction of gfp expression. bacterium suspension densities of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   were used for inoculation at  <dig>  mpa vacuum pressure for  <dig> min. the percentage of gfp expressing plants was above 79% with a suspension density exceeding  <dig>  od <dig> .

comparison of gfp expressing plants obtained with vacuum infiltration of germinated seeds with agrobacterium versus leaf injected plants
germinated pea seeds were vacuum infiltrated  or injected into the backside of the young leaves on 2-week-old pea plants using a 1-ml syringe . gfp fluorescence was monitored at 8- <dig> dpi. in the vacuum infiltrated seedlings gfp was first expressed in the stem and reached its highest value in both leaves and stems at 12- <dig> dpi . with leaf injection, gfp fluorescence was first visualized in treated leaves at 8- <dig> dpi , and gfp was detected in stems and upper non-agroinfected leaves on the next day. in the following two days the diffused gfp was more extensive in leaves . the amount of gfp tended to decrease with both of the treatments at 15- <dig> dpi. at 18- <dig> dpi the gfp fluorescence had almost disappeared. however, there was another peak of gfp expression in the upper stems in vacuum infiltrated plant leaves 6- <dig> days later.

gfp and afgf protein analysis
western blot analysis was used to compare the two methods. the total soluble proteins in  <dig> plants agroinfected with gv3101-pcae2-gfp and gv3101-pcae <dig> were extracted. the results showed single bands for gfp or afgf by western blot . the amount of gfp or afgf expressed in vacuum-infiltrated plants was similar to that obtained by leaf injection: gfp was 1% of the plant total soluble protein.

mitogenic activity of pea plant-derived afgf protein
the activity of the pea plant-derived acid fibroblast growth factor  was determined by a bioassay determining the mitogenic activity elicited in nih 3t <dig> cells. concentrations of afgf in the nih 3t <dig> cell cultures ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> ng/ml. the growth of 3t <dig> cells were stimulated significantly both by pea plant-derived afgf and the commercial afgf . the highest stimulation was obtained at  <dig> ng afgf added to  <dig> Î¼l cell culture.

discussion
importance of endothelic growth factors
with the discovery that oncogene induced excessive tumor cell proliferation is angiogenesis dependent the angiogenesis inducing activity of acid and basic fgfs as well as that of the vascular endothelic growth factor  has become of great interest. efficient and cost-effective production of these growth factors and other proteins involved in neovascularization are of prime importance in the analysis of the function of natural and synthetic inhibitors of the network of capillary tubes stimulated by these growth factors  <cit> . tumor cell proliferation in the absence of angiogenesis can give rise to dormant microscopic tumors of  <dig> mm <dig> or less but these in situ cancers are harmless to the host. however a switch to the angiogenic phenotype permits these dormant cancers to become rapidly growing tumors that can subsequently metastasize  <cit> .

the gene participants in the angiogenic switch have recently been determined  <cit> . human dermal endothelial cells isolated from two different human donors were treated for  <dig> h with  vascular endothelial growth factor  ,  bfgf   combined vegf plus bfgf and  endostatin . after isolation of total rna from these cells upregulated and downregulated transcripts by the treatments were determined by microarray analysis of  <dig>  human cdna clones. expression levels of the rna transcripts were quantitated by real time pcr. after treatment with endostatin  <dig>  genes were significantly upregulated. these same genes were simultaneously down regulated after treatment with bfgf, and vegf+bfgf and are thus considered participants in anti-angiogenic signaling. conversely  <dig>  transcripts downregulated by endostatin were found upregulated after vegf, bfgf and vegf+bfgf treatment and are therefore considered participants in pro-angiogenic signaling.

fgfs including afgf and bfgf are implicated in maintenance of tumors often by mediating angiogenesis  <cit> . afgf is a growth factor for capillary blood vesselsand involved in the stimulation of dna synthesis and the proliferation of a wide variety of cell types  <cit> . it plays an important role in morphogenesis, angiogenesis and wound healing  <cit> .

a method for expressing large amounts of recombinant proteins in higher plants
in  <dig> an intact leaf vacuum infiltration system for transient expression of recombinant proteins by agrobacterium was applied to phaseolus acutifolius, phaseolus vulgaris, poplar and tobacco  <cit> . vacuum was exerted on detached leaves and the plant materials were difficult to preserve fresh after inoculation. green et al. used this method to express three therapeutic proteins: hgh, hawy <dig>  and lickm-pad <dig> in pisum sativum  varieties. in contrast to our method the plants were grown for 7- <dig> days before vacuum infiltration  <cit> . in our study vacuum infiltration was applied to germinated pea seeds with 2- <dig> cm roots and factors influencing expression efficiency such as vacuum pressure, vacuum duration and bacterial density have been optimized. the optimal conditions for transient expression were a vacuum pressure at  <dig>  mpa for  <dig> min with a bacterial od <dig> greater than  <dig> . these parameters were decisive factors causing 80% of the treated plants to produce the desired recombinant gfp.

CONCLUSIONS
when the modified pea early browning virus genomes with the targeted marker gfp were multiplied and spread in pea plants after inoculation, the gfp was concomitantly expressed at a high level. in the vacuum infiltrated seedlings gfp was first expressed in the stem and thereafter in leaves and reached its highest value in both leaves and stems at 12- <dig> dpi. the vacuum infiltration method, gives similar high yields to leaf injection but is more efficient. time consuming leaf injection was avoided and the production cycle of plants was shortened from  <dig> days to  <dig> days. mitogenic activity analysis demonstrated that the purified afgf from pea plants stimulated the growth of nih 3t <dig> cells. it is concluded that the reported procedure can provide large-amounts of functional recombinant proteins in pea and possibly other plants of interest. it can also be employed for virus induced gene silencing to study gene functions in a more effective way.
