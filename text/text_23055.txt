BACKGROUND
α-synuclein  is one of the key molecules involved in familial and sporadic parkinson’s disease  ; genomic multiplication and point mutations in the α-synuclein gene  are known to be causal factors for the familial parkinsonism forms of pd, park <dig> and park <dig> . αsyn comprises  <dig> amino acids, which form an amphipathic region, a nac domain, and an acidic tail  <cit> . because of the hydrophobicity of the nac domain, αsyn easily forms toxic fibrillar structures, and an excess amount of αsyn induces cell death, eventually leading to pd . αsyn is expressed in neurons, where it is involved in exocytosis in the presynaptic region  <cit> , and its transmission from cell to cell has been demonstrated . these findings suggest that clearance of αsyn in the brain is crucially important for prevention of neuronal cell death.

microglia are immune cells in the brain playing crucial roles in inflammatory responses, scavenging, and production of neurotropic factors  <cit> . accumulated evidence indicates that microglia participate in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . in alzheimer’s disease, β-amyloid stimulates microglia and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . clearance of β-amyloid by microglia has a critical role in prevention of the disease  <cit> . in pd, microglia are involved in both disease -prevention through clearance of αsyn and disease -progression through production of inflammatory cytokines in which the oligomeric αsyn stimulates toll-like receptor   <dig> whereas a high amount of monomeric αsyn stimulates tlr <dig> . among the various types of brain cells, microglia are known to have the highest ability to degrade αsyn  <cit> . one study using mice overexpressing αsyn has shown that acceleration of microglial clearance through αsyn opsonization ameliorated the degree of neurodegeneration  <cit> . it is believed that achieving adequate degradation of αsyn might be a new therapeutic approach for diseases characterized by pathological accumulation of αsyn  <cit> .


leucine-rich repeat kinase  <dig>  is the gene responsible for autosomal-dominant pd, park <dig>  which was originally defined by linkage analysis of a japanese family  . lrrk <dig> is a complex kinase consisting of lrr, roc, cor, kinase, and wd <dig> domains  <cit> . accumulated evidence suggests that lrrk <dig> plays a key role in axonal extension, autophagy, proliferation, and survival of neurons  <cit> . in addition to neurons, lrrk <dig> is highly expressed in immune cells such as b cells, macrophages, and microglia . several studies have demonstrated that lrrk <dig> is related to inflammatory responses of microglia that could be involved in the development and progression of neurodegeneration  <cit> . it has been reported that pathological mutations of lrrk <dig> lead to increased production of inflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

with regard to the association between lrrk <dig> and αsyn, it has been reported that lrrk <dig> knockout  attenuates the neuropathology that is induced by αsyn overexpression in mouse brain through a delay of neuronal death resulting from improved structure and function of the golgi complex  <cit> . another study has demonstrated that lrrk2-ko ameliorated neurodegeneration in αsyn-overexpressing rats by inhibiting the recruitment of chronically activated proinflammatory myeloid cells  <cit> . although these studies suggest an association between lrrk <dig> and the neuropathology caused by αsyn, no study has yet addressed how microglial lrrk <dig> is involved in αsyn clearance.

in the present study, we analyzed microglia treated with αsyn and revealed a new functional role of microglial lrrk <dig>  our results indicate that lrrk <dig> acts as a negative regulator of αsyn clearance.

RESULTS
lrrk <dig> is a negative regulator of αsyn clearance in microglia
to investigate the function of microglial lrrk <dig>  primary microglia were prepared from lrrk2-ko mice and littermate wt control mice by ni’s method  <cit> . immunostaining with antibodies against iba- <dig>  and gfap  revealed that the purity of the microglia was about 92%. no morphological differences in tomato lectin staining were observed between ko and wt microglia , and the mtt assay demonstrated no difference in viability between ko and wt microglia . furthermore, the phagocytotic activities of ko and wt microglia did not differ from each other when analyzed using fluorescent latex beads . these results indicated that lrrk <dig> is not related to these microglial phenotypes. for evaluation of αsyn clearance, we performed αsyn uptake and clearance assay using recombinant αsyn. the αsyn treatment did not alter the protein level of lrrk <dig>  in wt primary microglia . importantly, αsyn bands were detected only in the groups that had been treated with recombinant αsyn, indicating that the detected bands were not endogenous but exogenous recombinant αsyn. it was noteworthy that more αsyn was taken up by ko microglia than by wt microglia . the results were confirmed using different anti-αsyn and anti-gapdh antibodies . measurement of αsyn clearance showed that the level of residual αsyn in the culture medium of ko microglia was decreased more prominently than that in the medium of wt microglia . these results indicated that αsyn clearance by lrrk2-ko microglia is higher than that by wt microglia, suggesting that lrrk <dig> is a negative regulator of αsyn clearance in microglia.fig.  <dig> characterization of lrrk2-ko microglia. a tomato lectin staining of lrrk2-ko and wt microglia. one hundred cells were counted per culture well. n =  <dig> culture wells per group. scale bar 50 μm. b mtt assay for evaluating the viability of lrrk2-ko and wt microglia in the absence or presence of αsyn. the data represent percentage viability relative to culture day  <dig>  and were assessed by anova at each time point . n =  <dig> culture wells per group. c phagocytosis assay using fitc-microbeads. upper panel shows an image of microbead phagocytosis. scale bar 50 μm. lower panel shows the fluorescence intensity of microbeads taken up by microglia. forty cells were analyzed per group. the data are expressed as mean ± sd and were assessed by student’s t test. these experiments were carried out three times using independent primary microglia isolated from different mice, and a representative image and data are shown

lrrk <dig> regulates endocytotic αsyn uptake
it has been reported that αsyn is internalized through the endocytotic pathway  <cit> . on the other hand, lrrk <dig> is associated with rab <dig>  a member of the ras superfamily of small rab gtpases and a component of the early endosome  <cit> . to elucidate whether lrrk <dig> regulates endocytotic αsyn clearance through early endosomes, wt and ko microglia treated with recombinant αsyn were subjected to immunostaining with anti-αsyn and anti-rab <dig> antibodies. internalized αsyn was visualized as small particles spread widely in the all cell, and in keeping with the results of western analysis, ko microglia showed higher amount of αsyn than wt microglia . immunostaining for rab <dig> demonstrated a pattern similar to that of αsyn. interestingly, rab5-positive early endosomes were obviously increased in ko microglia relative to wt microglia. furthermore, as reported previously  <cit> , some of the αsyn taken up was co-localized with rab5-positive early endosomes. relative assessment of co-localization between αsyn and rab <dig> revealed that the rcoloc value for ko microglia was higher than that for wt microglia . these results suggested that the increased uptake of αsyn by lrrk2-ko microglia is associated with an increase of early endosomes, i.e. lrrk <dig> is a down-regulator of the endocytotic pathway.fig.  <dig> increment of endocytotic αsyn uptake by lrrk2-ko microglia. a confocal immunostaining images of αsyn and rab <dig> in ko and wt microglia. scale bar 50 μm. higher-magnification views of the boxed area show the detail of immunopositive particles. scale bar 20 μm. b cytofluorograms for αsyn and rab <dig> immunostaining evaluated using the high magnification views of ko and wt microglia. c the αsyn/rab <dig> correlation coefficient  values for ko and wt microglia. ten cells were randomly chosen per group. in all graphical representations, data are expressed as mean ± sd and were assessed by student’s t test; *p <  <dig> . the experiment was carried out three times using primary microglia isolated from independent mice, and a representative image and data are shown




early endosomes are selectively increased in lrrk2-ko microglia
to investigate whether there is any abnormality in other components of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway in ko microglia, lysosomes were analyzed by immunostaining with anti-lamp <dig> antibody  and a ph-sensitive molecular probe . in both analyses, the fluorescence intensities did not differ from that of wt microglia , indicating that the structure and function of the lysosome system were not altered in lrrk2-ko microglia. immunostaining of the early endosome, late endosome, and recycling endosome using antibodies against the marker molecules rab <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, revealed that the fluorescence intensity of rab5-positive endosomes, but not that of rab7- or 11-positive endosomes, was significantly increased in ko microglia relative to wt microglia . the increment of early endosomes in ko microglia was also confirmed by using celllight .fig.  <dig> increase of early endosomes, but not lysosomes, late, or recycling endosomes, in lrrk2-ko microglia. a immunostaining for lysosomal markers in ko and wt microglia. lysosomes and acidic lysosomes were visualized using anti-lamp <dig> and phrodo, respectively. b immunostaining for endosomal markers in ko and wt microglia. early endosomes, late endosomes, and recycling endosomes were visualized using antibodies against rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig>  respectively. scale bar 20 μm. quantification of fluorescence intensity per cell showing an increase of rab5-positive endosomes, but not rab7- and rab11-positive particles, in ko microglia. twenty-five cells were analyzed per group. c visualization of early endosomes using celllight. twenty-five cells were analyzed per group. in the graphical representation, data are expressed as mean ± sd and were assessed by student’s t test; *p <  <dig> . all experiments were carried out three times using primary microglia isolated from independent mice, and a representative image and data are shown




western analysis using the same antibodies confirmed that the level of rab <dig> protein was higher in ko microglia than in wt microglia . after treatment with recombinant αsyn, an increase in the level of rab <dig> protein in ko microglia, although not statistically significant, was also observed. these results indicated that early endosomes, but not other endosomes or lysosomes, are increased in lrrk2-ko microglia.fig.  <dig> higher rab <dig> protein level in ko microglia than in wt microglia. western analysis was performed to determine the protein levels of rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig> in ko and wt microglia treated with or without αsyn. the quantified density of each rab was normalized by the density of gapdh. n =  <dig> culture wells per group. in all graphical representations, data are expressed as mean ± sd and were assessed by anova . rab5: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; rab7: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ; and rab11: f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . the experiment was carried out three times using primary microglia isolated from independent mice, and a representative image and data are shown




lrrk <dig> controls the primary endocytotic process in microglia
recently, lrrk <dig> has been reported to associate with dynamin  <dig> in sh-sy5y neuronal cells  <cit> . dynamin  <dig> is one of the dynamin gtpase superfamily of molecules that modulate fission of the cytoplasmic membrane in the endocytosis pathway. to investigate how lrrk <dig> knockout affects dynamin  <dig>  triple immunofluorescence staining with anti-lrrk <dig>  anti-rab <dig>  and anti-dynamin <dig> antibodies was performed on ko and wt microglia. all staining was visualized as particles, and co-localization among lrrk <dig>  rab <dig>  and dynamin <dig> was observed in primary microglia , in accordance with the previous study conducted using sh-sy5y cells. analysis of relative staining intensity showed that the rcoloc value for rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> was increased in lrrk2-ko microglia relative to wt microglia . these results indicated that lrrk <dig> down-regulates the coordination between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig>  resulting in reduced production of early endosomes.fig.  <dig> increased co-localization between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> in lrrk2-ko microglia. a comparison of co-localization of rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> between ko and wt microglia. confocal immunostaining images show lrrk2-, rab5-, and dynamin1-immunopositive particles in the ko and wt microglia. scale bar 10 μm. b cytofluorograms of dynamin  <dig> and rab <dig> immunostaining in ko and wt microglia. c the rcoloc values of dynamin1/rab <dig> in ko and wt microglia. ten cells were analyzed per group. in the graphical representation, data are expressed as mean ± sd and were assessed by student’s t test; ***p <  <dig> . all experiments were carried out three times using primary microglia isolated from independent mice, and a representative image and data are shown




discussion
in the present study, we clarified for the first time the role of lrrk <dig> in the process of αsyn clearance in microglia. primary microglia isolated from lrrk2-ko mice exhibited increased uptake and clearance of αsyn and an increased immunostaining of rab5-positive early endosomes, but not other endosomes or lysosomes. ko microglia also showed an increased degree of co-localization between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig>  this study provides the first evidence that lrrk <dig> in microglia has a negative regulatory role in αsyn clearance by the early endocytosis pathway.

because lrrk2-ko microglia showed up-regulation of the endocytosis pathway in both the presence and absence of recombinant αsyn, i.e., independently of exogenous αsyn, it is likely that autonomous up-regulation of endocytosis in lrrk2-ko microglia is one of the mechanisms for the increment of αsyn uptake and clearance. a recent study has reported that rab5b, an isoform of rab <dig>  is phosphorylated by lrrk <dig> at thr  <dig>  resulting in a decreased endocytosis rate in hela cells  <cit> . it is possible that up-regulation of the endocytosis rate in ko microglia could be due to the lack of phosphorylation of rab5b. our findings also suggested that enhancement of the coordination between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> is another mechanism for the up-regulation of rab5-positive early endosomes. it has been shown that g2019s-mutant lrrk <dig> with higher kinase activity inhibits the co-localization between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig>  <cit> . given that the kinase activity of lrrk <dig> down-regulates the co-localization between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig>  knockout of lrrk <dig> may enhance their co-localization and lead to an increase of rab5-positive early endosomes. as an another possible mechanism, lrrk <dig> may regulate the amount of the rab <dig> molecule itself. it has been reported that macrophages of the lrrk2-ko mouse exhibit an increase of il- <dig> production through increased nuclear translocation of nfat  <cit> . because il- <dig> is known to increase rab <dig>  but not other rabs  <cit> , it is possible that the elevated level of il- <dig> in ko microglia may selectively increase rab5-positive early endosomes and consequently promote the coordination between rab <dig> and dynamin  <dig> 

in contrast to our study, it has recently been reported that the protein level of αsyn was comparable between lrrk2-ko and wt rats that overexpress αsyn after viral transfection  <cit> . it is possible that the amount of virally overexpressed αsyn might far exceed the capacity of microglia to clear it. lrrk <dig> ko has also been reported to abrogate the neurodegeneration induced by αsyn overexpression in this strain of rat. it is possible that a decreased inflammatory response resulting from lack of lrrk <dig>  rather than up-regulated αsyn clearance, might be responsible for this alleviation of neurodegeneration.

it has been shown that an excess amount of αsyn induces neuronal death , and that continuity of this process will eventually cause pd  <cit> . because αsyn is known to be transmitted from cell to cell, and microglia have the highest ability to clear it , αsyn clearance by microglia, in addition to that by neurons themselves, would be of crucial importance for maintaining a healthy brain environment.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that lrrk <dig> in microglia may function as the offending molecule responsible for neurodegeneration, in terms of down-regulation of αsyn clearance. in other words, inhibition of lrrk <dig> would be a potential therapeutic approach for pd.
