BACKGROUND
the arthropods are a diverse group of organisms including chelicerata , myriapoda , crustacea , and insecta . molecular estimates indicate that ticks emerged  <dig> ±  <dig> mya, while the prostriate and metastriate hard tick lineages diverged  <dig> ±  <dig> mya  <cit> . rhipicephalus  microplus is considered to be the most economically important tick parasite in the world. r. microplus is a hard tick associated with cattle infestations but can also occasionally be found on other hosts including horses, goats, sheep, pigs and some wild animals living in subtropical and tropical regions worldwide  <cit> .

r. microplus is a member of the metastriate lineage of ticks that includes numerous genera and species of medical and veterinary importance. in comparison, i. scapularis is a member of the prostriate lineage that comprises the single genus ixodes. the prostriate and metastriate lineages differ markedly in many aspects of their biology such as type of developmental cycle , host range and vector competence. comparative analyses between prostriate and metastriate gene sets including mirnas may reveal the genetic basis for fundamental differences in the biology of these tick lineages  <cit> .

r. microplus is generally a single host tick spending all parasitic life cycle stages on cattle. the eggs hatch in the environment and the larvae crawl up grass or other plants to find a host. in the summer, r. microplus can survive for as long as  <dig> to  <dig> months without feeding. in cooler temperatures, they may live without food for up to six months. newly attached seed ticks  are usually found on the softer skin inside the thigh, flanks, and forelegs. after feeding, the larvae molt twice, to become nymphs and male or female adults. each developmental stage  feeds only once, but the feeding takes places over several days. adult male ticks become sexually mature after feeding, and mate with feeding females. an adult female tick that has fed and mated detaches from the host and deposits a single batch of many eggs in the environment. typically, these eggs are placed in crevices or debris, or under stones. the female tick dies after ovipositing. ticks in the subgenus boophilus have a life cycle that can be completed in  <dig> to  <dig> weeks; this characteristic can result in a heavy tick burden particularly on tick susceptible cattle in tropical areas  <cit> .

micrornas  are small 19-- <dig> nucleotide regulatory rnas that act as post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression in animals and plants  <cit> . they are estimated to represent 1% of the transcriptome in higher eukaryotes and predicted to control the expression of up to 30% of messenger rnas  <cit> . most mirnas are encoded in intergenic regions and are transcribed by rna polymerase ii as long primary nuclear mirnas , which range from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides in length  <cit> . one pri-mirna typically contains a single or several mirna precursors  as stem-loop, hairpin structures flanked by unstructured, single stranded rna sequences  <cit> . pre-mirnas are cleaved near their loops by the cytoplasmic rnase iii enzyme dicer to generate a heteroduplex of two ~23-nt rnas that are then packed into the risc complex  <cit> . mature mirna sequences are encoded either in the 5'-arm or the 3'-arm of pre-mirnas. the decision as to which sequence is incorporated into the silencing complex is influenced by the difference in pairing stabilities between the two ends of the mirna:mirna star  duplex, with preferential incorporation of the strand whose 5'end is less stably paired  <cit> . in some cases both strands of the mirna:mirna* duplex were found expressed at similar levels  <cit> . about half of the mirna genes in drosophila melanogaster are clustered and transcribed from a single polycystronic pri-mirna  <cit> .

recently, next generation sequencing technologies have been utilized to profile and discover mirnas genome-wide. to assist in this process it is normally required to have a reference genome sequence. currently, there is no reference genome sequence for r. microplus, with the ixodes scapularis genome draft  the closest reference genome in which  <dig> mirnas have been identified  <cit> . some mirnas are highly conserved throughout evolution including let- <dig>  present in metazoan lineages such as arthropods and vertebrates that diverged 641- <dig> mya  <cit> . thus, the use of the d. melanogaster reference genome for which  <dig> mirnas are currently annotated  <cit>  may allow not only the identification of highly conserved tick mirnas, but also to discover arthropod-specific mirnas. previous studies have shown that mirnas are continuously being added to metazoan genomes through time, and once these are integrated into gene regulatory networks, show only rare nucleotide substitutions within the mature mirna sequence at predictable positions and are only rarely secondarily lost  <cit> . this is likely related to the strong purifying selection against changes in secondary structure of pre-mirnas  <cit> . wheeler and colleagues  <cit>  documented evolutionary stable shifts to the determination of position  <dig> of the mature sequence that can be displaced towards either the 5' or 3' end, a phenomenon called seed shifting, as well as the ability to post-transcriptionally edit the 5' end of the mature read, changing the identity of the seed sequence and possibly the repertoire of downstream targets.

currently there are no known micrornas reported for r. microplus and we aimed at the identification and discovery of evolutionary conserved as well as novel tick-specific mirnas in r. microplus by using a combination of next generation high throughput sequencing, comparative genomics and de novo computational screening. we constructed eight small transcriptome libraries derived from various cattle tick life stages and from selected organs including gut, salivary glands and ovaries. we aim to characterize changes in gene set and expression levels of mirnas at various tick life stages as well as selected organs. we also conducted an evolutionary analysis to identify subsets of r. microplus mirnas and mirna* sequences that are perfectly conserved since either the nephrozoa , protostomia , arthropoda  or ixodidae  ancestor  <cit> . we also provide evidence of seed shifts and gene duplications unique to the r. microplus lineage.

RESULTS
identification of evolutionary conserved and cattle tick-specific mirnas
currently there are  <dig> known mirnas in ixodes scapularis, a species belonging to prostriate hard tick lineage  <cit> , but there are no known mirnas identified for r. microplus or other metastriate hard tick species. in order to identify r. microplus mirnas and expand the repertoire of cattle tick mirnas and to obtain insights into changes in mirna expression throughout the cattle tick life stages and in selected adult female tick organs, a high throughput sequencing approach was conducted. this approach generated more than  <dig> million short reads derived from the tick small rna transcriptome from eggs, unfed larvae, larvae exposed for six hours to the host without being allowed to feed , and adult ticks as well as selected adult female tick organs . to identify tick mirnas we anticipated that a fraction of the known arthopoda mirnas should be conserved in both the chelicerata  and insecta lineages regardless of their estimated divergence time of more than  <dig> mya  <cit> . under this assumption, sequenced short reads from tick samples could be mapped onto the d. melanogaster genome in order to identify identical or nearly identical conserved tick mirnas. to be able to distinguish true sequence polymorphisms from non-specific mapping artefacts the performance of several short read aligners were initially evaluated to define the tool that mapped the largest amount of true positives and introduced a limited amount of false positive aligned short reads. we created simulated 36-bp short reads using mutation rates from  <dig> % to up to 16%  containing both snps and/or insertion/deletions  and evaluated the ability of each tool to correctly align simulated short reads. our results indicated that novoalign produced the best overall short read mapping performance . thus, we used this tool to align the generated tick short reads onto the drosophila genome. to ensure reliable short read alignments base quality scores were taken into account to conduct an interative alignment approach aiming to identify the best mapping position for each read. novoalign generates a mapping quality score for each aligned read so that ambiguously mapped short reads can be removed from downstream analyses. out of  <dig> million short reads derived from various cattle tick life cycle stages and three key organs,  <dig>  million reads were aligned onto known mirna loci on the drosophila genome with at least a quality alignment score of q =  <dig> . we manually inspected the aligned reads onto mirna loci and removed non-specific alignments. to identify possible duplicated r. microplus mirnas all reads mapped onto a single d. melanogaster mirna locus were inspected and if mirna isoforms were observed these were required to be cloned in at least two distinct libraries to be validated. this approach identified  <dig> r. microplus mirnas including four duplicated copies for rmi-let- <dig> , and two duplicated copies for rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig>  in addition we also detected the expression of  <dig> mirna* sequences, of these four have counterparts in d. melanogaster  <cit>  .

it has been recently reported that there has been gain and loss of mirna families in arthropod lineages  <cit> . thus some known mirnas may have been lost in the d. melanogaster genome but still be present in tick genomes. to evaluate this possibility and also to identify novel tick-specific mirnas we conducted a computational screening using mirdeep as previously described  <cit> . to screen for candidate mirna loci we aligned small rna reads from each tick library onto both the i. scapularis draft genome  and r. microplus draft genomic contigs that were recently sequenced and assembled by our group . this identified candidate pre-mirna sequences that were further screened against nucleotide databases and those having similarity to known coding/non-coding genes were excluded. furthermore, short reads from all libraries were then aligned onto remaining pre-mirna candidates and those not having typical mirna alignments were removed  <cit> . this analysis identified  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas in i. scapularis and r. microplus genomic contigs, respectively. we next screened the identified mirnas against all annotated mirnas  <cit>  and determined that  <dig> and  <dig>  mirna in i. scapularis and r. microplus, respectively, had counterparts in other species. in addition the expression of three mirna* sequences were detected . as anticipated this approach identified five  evolutionary conserved mirnas in r. microplus that were lost in the d. melanogaster genome. overall we identified  <dig> mirnas in r. microplus that have counterparts in other species. out of the  <dig> evolutionary conserved r. microplus mirnas we also detected the expression of  <dig> mirna* sequences . mirna* sequences have been implicated in modifying mature mirna and 3'utr evolution in flies  <cit> . thus, these species along with the mature tick mirnas will facilitate the understanding of changes in gene regulatory networks during r. microplus life stages and in vital organs.

in the above analysis, we also identified  <dig> novel r. microplus mirnas and of these  <dig> were conserved in the i. scapularis genome . examples of pre-mirnas of novel tick-specific mirnas showing typical drosha-processed features including localization of mature mirna within few nucleotides of the loop  <cit>  are shown in figure  <dig>  interestingly we detected the expression of mirna* sequences in four novel tick pre-mirnas common to both r. microplus and i. scapularis . to determine if the  <dig> identified novel r. microplus mirnas are restricted to cattle tick, we aligned mature mirna and pre-mirnas sequences onto the genomes of anopheles gambiae, apis mellifera, aedes aegypti, tribolium castaneum, nasonia vitripennis, pediculus humanus, culex quinquefasciatus and nine drosophila genomes . the mapping coordinates of aligned reads were then used to retrieve genomic segments to evaluate for typical pre-mirna structures. none of the  <dig> novel r. microplus mirnas were found conserved in the  <dig> tested genomes suggesting that these may represent tick-specific mirnas. the genome size of the cattle tick r. microplus is three times larger than that of i. scapularis, thus we anticipate that other novel r. microplus mirnas are likely to be identified once the complete genome becomes available.

overall, we identified  <dig> r. microplus mirnas with  <dig> of these expressed during various cattle tick life stages and  <dig> in selected adult female tick organs . we found  <dig> mature mirnas expressed in both the life stage and tick organ samples with the majority of these  corresponding to evolutionary conserved mirnas . in contrast, the majority of the  <dig> life stage-and  <dig> organ-specific mirnas corresponded to novel cattle tick-specific mirnas suggesting that these mirnas play unique roles at specific life stages and key tick organs. a recent study suggested that mirna invention is closely related to the evolution of tissue identities in bilaterian species  <cit> . further investigation is required to determine if novel tick-specific mirnas contribute to the implementation of biological features unique to tick species.

similar to what has been observed in other species we found mirnas that show expression from both arms of the pre-mirna. in cattle ticks we observed co-expression of  <dig> mature and complementary star sequences including rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig> that are expressed in all cattle tick life stages evaluated in this study . co-expression of rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig> mature and star sequences was restricted to larval stages while rmi-mir-iab-5p was only detected in adult ticks. these mirna* sequences were highly conserved between r. microplus and i. scapularis despite their estimated divergence of  <dig> ±  <dig> mya  <cit>  indicating that these sequences in these species are under selective pressure to avoid nucleotide changes. interestingly rmi-mir-79*, rmi-mir-281* and rmi-mir-993* are expressed at significantly higher levels than their mature counterparts suggesting that some of the currently annotated mature mirnas in reference databases may correspond to mirna* sequences or in some lineages like r. microplus mirna* sequences become the primary transcript from the mirna/mirna* duplex.

numbers indicate the total number of reads overlapping mature mirna and mirna* sequences. statistically predominant transcripts  for each mirna-mirna* pairwise comparison in each sample are shown in bold. abbreviations are as shown in figure 2b.

changes in mirna expression during cattle tick life cycle stages
to evaluate global changes in mirna expression during r. microplus life stages, short read counts overlapping the  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mirna* sequences were normalized as reads per million and compared against the overall expression found in eggs. our results indicate that in the transition from egg to larval stages there is nearly a 90-fold increase in mirna transcripts . interestingly, larvae exposed to the host for six hours showed a significant reduction in the accumulation of mirna transcripts as compared to unexposed larvae. the largest accumulation of mirna transcripts was found in female adults, showing  <dig> -fold higher level than males. we also compared changes in expression between evolutionary conserved and tick-specific  mirnas. evolutionary conserved r. microplus mirnas are significantly more highly expressed as compared to the identified novel tick-specific mirnas , only during larval stages there was an increment in the expression of tick-specific mirnas. overall in the life stage samples, we identified  <dig> r. microplus mirnas, of these  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were expressed in egg, larval and adult stages, respectively . interestingly,  <dig>  of the identified mirnas were expressed in all cattle tick life stages with  <dig> of these evolutionary conserved in a range of species and only one rmi-mir- <dig> unique to tick species. in contrast most of the stage-specific mirnas corresponded to novel tick-specific mirnas. these findings suggest that evolutionary conserved mirnas play a ubiquitous role through out cattle tick life stages, while most novel tick-unique mirnas are restricted to specific life stages.

we next evaluated the percentage fraction of expression of each mirna in each sample. in eggs there are five abundantly expressed mirnas including rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir-310/mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig> that accounted for  <dig> % of the total amount of mirna transcripts , while in all other life stages mir- <dig> was the most abundantly expressed mirna . among the top ten most abundant mirnas in eggs we found two novel cattle tick-specific mirnas, rmi-mir-5316b and rmi-mir- <dig>  that accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mirna transcripts, respectively . these novel mirnas were only expressed at statistically significant levels  during the egg stage  suggesting they play critical roles during this stage.

although rmi-mir- <dig> is the most abundantly expressed mirna in cattle tick larvae , we found eight other mirnas, including rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  and rmi-mir- <dig>  that had a higher fold-change ratio in mirna transcript levels as compared to that in eggs suggesting that these mirnas may play a role during larval development . we also found two novel tick-specific mirnas, rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig>  among the top ten expressed larval mirnas representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mirna transcripts . interestingly, in drosophila mir- <dig> is encoded within the hox cluster downstream of its target sex combs reduced , which is a gene required for proper embryo and adult development in flies  <cit> . it has also been reported that the mir- <dig> binding site in the src 3'utr is conserved across a large number of arthropod species, some with an estimated divergence time of over hundreds of millions years  <cit> .

selected mirnas showing statistically significant up-regulation are shown in bold . the l/e expression ratio was calculated using normalized read per million counts for each mirna. complete list of mirnas and statistics are shown in additional file  <dig> 

similar to the observation in larval stages, rmi-mir- <dig> was vastly abundant in adult ticks accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of mirna transcripts in females and males, respectively . the second most abundant mirna in adult ticks is rmi-let-7a, a mirna known to be involved in the transition from late larval to adult stage in worms  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated if rmi-let-7a is also expressed during tick nymph stage associated with the transition to adult fate. in contrast to egg and larval stages, no novel tick-specific mirnas were observed among the top ten most abundant mirnas in adult ticks. these findings suggest that novel tick-specific mirnas may play key roles during early embryo and larval development stages.

the relative changes in expression of  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> mirna* expressed in all life stages tested in r. microplus are shown in figure 3e. interestingly let- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are known to be clustered in the same genomic location in the d. melanogaster and a. gambiae genomes within  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively  <cit> . in general it is accepted that clustered mirnas are likely to share highly correlated expression profiles if these are within  <dig> kb of each other  <cit> . our results show that these three mirnas present similar expression trends  suggesting that rmi-let-7a, rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig> may also collocate to the same genomic region in the r. microplus genome. to validate the observed mirna expression profiles we conducted real time pcr amplification of five randomly selected mirnas that showed perfect sequence conservation between ticks and flies. these included rmi-let-7a, rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  and rmi-mir- <dig>  as controls we selected u <dig> and snorna- <dig> non-coding rnas, which are reference genes used in drosophila studies , but none of these were either expressed or conserved in cattle ticks. we then normalized the relative expression of all mirnas in eggs, frustrated larvae and female ticks against the expression of rmi-let- <dig> in female ticks . our results validated the abundant expression of rmi-mir- <dig> in eggs, frustrated larvae and female samples. we also verified that rmi-let- <dig> is highly expressed in female ticks as compared to eggs or frustrated larvae samples . overall we observed a good agreement between the trends observed in real time pcr quantification and high throughput small rna sequencing.

host-odour recognition triggers changes in tick mirna expression
r. microplus normally parasitizes a single host and it is believed this host specificity depends on the specific detection of bovine phenolic compounds  <cit> . to evaluate if host odour recognition by ticks may trigger changes in mirna expression we exposed tick larvae to its host for six hours without allowing the larvae to feed , and then we collected small rna samples for high throughput sequencing. we found  <dig> mirna expressed in frustrated larvae, of these  <dig> were also expressed in unexposed larvae . there were six mirnas expressed in unexposed larvae that were not detected in frustrated larvae, particularly rmi-mir- <dig> that showed a significant lost in expression . only rmi-mir-31a, rmi-mir-285a and rmi-mir- <dig> were specifically detected in frustrated larvae, but none of these had significant expression levels  . the major difference in mirna expression found in frustrated larvae, as compared to un-exposed larvae, is the down-and up-regulation of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas, respectively  . among the most down regulated mirnas in frustrated larvae are rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig> and five tick-specific novel mirnas including rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig> . other significantly up-regulated mirnas in frustrated larvae compared to unexposed larvae are rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir-79*, rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig>  . the identification of novel tick-specific mirnas showing up and down-regulation upon exposure to the host make these molecules attractive candidates for further host-recognition functional studies.

selected mirnas showing statistically significant up-regulation are shown in bold . the fl/l expression ratio was calculated using normalized read per million counts for each mirna. complete list of mirnas and statistics are shown in additional file  <dig> 

changes in mirna expression between female and male adult ticks
there are significant morphological and behavioural differences between female and male ticks. to evaluate whether there are gender differences in the expression of mirnas we inspected changes in the mirna transcriptome between female and male adult ticks. we found  <dig> mirnas expressed in adult cattle ticks, of these  <dig> were expressed in both females and males. we found two mirnas, rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig>  specifically expressed in male ticks, while another seven mirnas were detected in female ticks with four of these also expressed in larval stages . the three mirnas uniquely expressed in females were rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir-5317a and rmi-mir- <dig>  which were expressed at low levels . among the mirnas expressed in both females and males,  <dig> were up regulated in females  including the let-7-complex mirnas rmi-let-7a, rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir- <dig>  . although similar levels of up regulation of the former two mirnas in females were observed, rmi-mir- <dig> showed an expression level similar to that in males. differential accumulation of these let-7-c mirnas, which were shown to co-transcribe as a single polycistronic primary transcript  <cit> , may be due to post-transcriptional processing of mature mirnas from primary transcripts undergoing developmental regulation  <cit> . interestingly, loss of function of let- <dig> in drosophila specifically affects female reproduction, while males retain fertility levels comparable to that in wild type flies  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated if the observed up regulation of rmi-let-7a in female ticks is required for maintaining both normal fertility and oviposition  <cit> .

selected mirnas showing statistically significant up-regulation are shown in bold . the f/m ratios were calculated using normalized reads per million counts for each mirna. complete list of mirnas and statistics are shown in additional file  <dig> 

in male ticks we found  <dig> mirnas up regulated in comparison to female ticks  including rmi-mir- <dig>  rmi-mir-bantam, rmi-mir- <dig> and rmi-mir-310/mir- <dig> . it is intriguing to observe the up regulation of two known anti-apoptotic mirnas, rmi-mir-bantam and rmi-mir- <dig> in adult males  <cit> . mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are preferentially expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles in xenopus laevis  <cit>  both have opposing effects, with mir- <dig> being rather pro-apoptotic  <cit> . interestingly, mir- <dig> level was shown to significantly increase in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . in ticks blood digestion has been suggested to be a source of oxidative stress  <cit> . this is particularly relevant for female ticks that ingest large volumes of blood  in preparation for the laying of about  <dig>  to  <dig>  eggs  <cit> , while males rarely feed on blood  <cit> . interestingly, apoptosis of salivary glands prior to oviposition in female ticks was reported for dermacentor variabilis  <cit>  and r. microplus  <cit> . surprisingly r. microplus female ticks presented apoptosis just after  <dig> hours of host detachment  <cit>  contrasting with the  <dig> days required for d. variabilis female ticks  <cit> . these observations suggest that in r. microplus molecular changes are likely to occur prior to female detachment from the host that predispose them for a rapid onset of apoptosis and consequently facilitating egg laying. this notion correlates with the observed significant up regulation of rmi-mir- <dig> in semi-engorged females as compared to males . it remains to be elucidated if blood-mediated oxidative stress in r. microplus contributes to the increased expression level of rmi-mir- <dig> in females and if this mirna exercise pro-apoptotic activities similar to its x. laevis mir- <dig> counterpart  <cit>  that would ultimately facilitate egg laying.

microrna expression in selected tick organs
primary target organs for cattle tick control are the gut, salivary glands and ovaries of adult female ticks. nearly  <dig>  million short reads were generated for these three organs, of these  <dig>  and  <dig>  short reads were mapped onto evolutionary conserved and novel tick-specific mirna loci, respectively . to compare global mirna expression levels between these samples we normalized all mapped mirna transcripts in each sample as reads per million. the tick gut sample showed 2-fold and 5-fold higher relative amount of mirna transcripts as compared to salivary glands and ovaries samples, respectively . these differences were due to the larger amount of transcripts mapped onto evolutionary conserved mirna loci in the gut sample as compared to salivary gland and ovary samples . we found  <dig> mirnas expressed in all tested tick organs with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed in gut, salivary glands and ovaries, respectively . a comparison of r. microplus mirnas found in female tick organs with those found in whole semi engorged adult females revealed that  <dig> mirnas were commonly expressed in all samples . interestingly the majority of the commonly expressed r. microplus mirnas  in tick organs corresponded to known mirnas in other species, while  <dig> of the  <dig> organ-specifically expressed mirnas found in this study correspond to novel tick-specific mirnas . most of the novel tick specific mirnas were expressed at low levels except for rmi-mir- <dig> found in all three organs and rmi-mir- <dig> present in adult female tick ovaries .

similar to what we observed for life stage samples, rmi-mir- <dig> was the most abundantly expressed mirna in all sampled organs accounting for ~81-83% of the identified r. microplus mirna transcripts in ovaries and gut, and for  <dig> % of the mirna transcripts in salivary glands . other highly expressed mirnas in salivary glands are rmi-let-7a , rmi-mir- <dig> , rmi-mir-263a  and rmi-mir- <dig>  . recently, two studies have reported the secretion of mirnas into the saliva  <cit> . interestingly, among the most abundantly expressed r. microplus mirnas in salivary glands, only let- <dig> orthologs were found expressed in human salivary glands  <cit> . the expression of let- <dig> in the salivary glands of ticks and vertebrates suggests a functional role for this mirna throughout the evolution of this organ.

global comparison of mirna expression in cattle ticks
to evaluate similarities in the global tick mirna expression pattern among all samples we conducted a hierarchical clustering as described by eisen et al.  <cit>  and found that there is low mirna diversity in eggs, while larvae and female ticks samples showed a large diversity of expressed mirnas . adult female tick salivary glands and gut samples clustered together with adult tick samples showing high expression of various mirnas, but also having unique signatures owing to the presence of tissue-specific mirnas. interestingly most of the identified r. microplus mirnas with known counterpart in other species showed high expression levels in most tick life cycle stages and tick organs, while the identified novel tick-specific mirnas presented more restricted expression patterns accounting for the majority of the tick life stage-specific and tissue-specific r. microplus mirnas.

d. melanogaster has  <dig> annotated mirnas  <cit> , of these  <dig> mirnas are closely located  in  <dig> genomic clusters . we found tick mirnas overlapping five of these clusters, including the mir-100:mir-125:let- <dig>  mir-275:mir- <dig>  mir-2a-2:mir-2a-1:mir-2b- <dig>  and mir-310:mir-311:mir-312:mir-313:mir-991:mir- <dig> clusters . to infer if these clusters may also be conserved in the cattle tick genome we analysed the co-expression pattern of tick mirnas across all samples. we observed correlated co-expression profiles of tick mirnas overlapping two d. melanogaster clusters, mir-100:mir-125:let- <dig> and mir-275:mir- <dig> indicating that these clusters may also be conserved in the cattle tick genome .

evolutionary conservation of r. microplus mirnas
we conducted an evolutionary analysis to determine if mirnas found in r. microplus were perfectly conserved or accumulated nucleotide changes since the last common available ancestor . we collected all available mirnas  <cit>  and for those overlapping the identified r. microplus mirnas we determined the ancestral sequences using a maximum likelihood approach  <cit>  under the junkes-cantor model  <cit>  using a tree topology similar to that shown in figure 5a . we found that 73% of the r. microplus mirnas were perfectly conserved since at least  <dig> mya with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas conserved since the nephrozoan, protostomian, arthropoda and ixodidae ancestor, respectively . only 27% of the r. microplus mirnas presented nucleotide substitutions unique to the r. microplus lineage. these unique mirnas can be further divided into three groups: 1) unique mirna variants in r. microplus for which a protostomian ancestral sequence is available , 2) duplicated copies of r. microplus mirnas , and 3) unique r. microplus mirnas for which an ancestral sequence is not available and only ortholog sequences in the insecta lineage are known .

we next examined the number of nucleotide substitutions found in each of the above subsets of r. microplus mirnas by comparing against an ancestral sequence if it can be unambiguously determined . in cases where no ancestral sequences are available owing to the gain of that mirna in a more recent ancestor the number of base substitutions was recorded as zero . the average number of nucleotide substitutions was then calculated for each subset. we determined  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  average nucleotide changes for r. microplus mirnas conserved since the nephrozoan , protostomian , arthropoda  and ixodiade  ancestor, respectively . furthermore we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  average nucleotide changes in r. microplus mirna unique variants  and duplicated mirnas  . interestingly the average number of nucleotide substitution in mirnas was directly proportional to the evolutionary time of the ancestor where the oldest conserved mirnas showed the least amount of nucleotide changes while more recently acquired mirnas showed slightly increased number of nucleotide changes. recently, gain of mirna genes in metazoan species was suggested to be associated with the increase in morphological complexity  <cit> . our findings correlate with the notion that perfectly conserved mirnas since for example the nephrozoan ancestor may regulate key basic processes common to a range of animal species and therefore be under stronger selective pressure to remain unchanged throughout the evolution, while those mirnas more recently acquired or perfectly conserved since a more recent ancestor such the arthropoda ancestor may play more specific roles for these species.

we further interrogated the position of the nucleotide substitutions for each of the above subsets as compared to an ancestral sequence and found no base substitutions overlapping the mature mirna seed  in all the identified r. microplus mirnas . r. microplus mirnas conserved since the protostomian, arthropoda and ixodidae ancestor preferentially accumulated nucleotide changes in the 3' end of the mature mirnas . mirnas that are unique variants to r. microplus particularly those that have a reference protostomian ancestral sequence or are duplicated mirnas showed base substitutions in the middle  and 3'end  . only unique mirnas variants without a reference ancestral sequence but with ortholog genes in insecta  showed an apparent uniform distribution of nucleotide changes from position  <dig> to  <dig>  but this is likely due to independent accumulated nucleotide substitution in the chelicerata and insecta lineages since the last common arthropoda ancestor. we also observed that d. melanogaster and a. gambie tend to have an increased number of base substitutions as compared to r. microplus .

to determine if similar biases in nucleotide substitutions are observed in mirna* sequences we evaluated nucleotide changes in seven mirna*  for which ortholog sequences are available among insecta species or in lottia gigantea  for mir-281*. figure 6c shows that most mirna* sequences accumulated preferential base substitutions in position  <dig>  in the middle  and the 3'end. only rmi-mir-iab-4-3p accumulated base substitutions preferentially towards the 5'end, but these nucleotide changes are compensatory mutations to those found in the mature rmi-mir-iab-4-5p sequence  to maintain a proper pre-mirna structure . based in our results it is apparent that mirna* sequences have similar selective pressure to that of mature sequences to avoid base substitutions in the 'mirna* seed' sequence  despite this region being complementary to the 3'end portion of the mature mirna where most base substitutions are accumulated. these findings suggest that r. microplus mirna* sequences may play regulatory roles similar to their mature counterparts and this view is further supported by the significantly higher expression level of rmi-mir-79*, rmi-mir-281* and rmi-mir-993* as compared to their mature mirna complementary sequences .

seed shifting of r. microplus mirnas
the displacement of the mirna seed  towards either the 5' or 3' is referred as 'seed shifting'  <cit> . as shown in additional file  <dig> we found three r. microplus mirnas showing one-nucleotide seed shifting with two of these  and a third mirna  displacing the seed towards the 3' and 5', respectively. interestingly seed shifting in mir- <dig> was not observed in the sister taxon i. scapularis nor the crustacean daphnia pulex with which rmi-mir- <dig> shares perfect sequence identity. seed shifting of mir- <dig> was also found in capitella teleta  and insecta species, but not in their sister taxon, namely, mollusca and crustacea, respectively. these findings suggest that mir- <dig> underwent three independent seed shifting events of one-base displacement towards the 3' end in r. microplus, c. teleta and insecta ancestor lineages. we also found two independent seed shifting events for mir- <dig> one in r. microplus and another among insecta species  but not in their sister taxon daphnia pulex . the observed consistency in the seed shifting direction in independent events suggests that this phenomenon may be under selective pressure.

in our data only rmi-mir-iab-4-5p represents an example of seed shifting unique to the r. microplus lineage, but this mirna is an exceptional example as both mature and star sequences have also accumulated a large number of base substitutions . despite the observed seed shifting and nucleotide substitutions changes the expression level of the mature rmi-mir-iab-4-5p is  <dig> -fold higher than that of rmi-mir-iab-4-3p, which is consistent with the  <dig> -fold higher expression level of dme-mir-iab-4-5p as compared to dme-mir-4-3p  <cit> . these findings suggest that despite the various molecular changes that can take place in a mirna-mirna* duplex, the expression ratio at which these molecules are found expressed in distinct taxa remains unchanged reflecting that other mechanisms may regulate the dosage at which each molecule is present to properly control downstream targets.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified  <dig> r. microplus mirnas being  <dig> of these known in other species including  <dig> in i. scapularis. overall we found  <dig> rmi-mirnas expressed in various cattle tick life stages and  <dig> rmi-mirnas expressed in the adult female tick gut, salivary glands and ovaries. novel tick-specific mirnas account for the majority of the life-stage and organ-specific expression profiles found in r. microplus mirnas and represent attractive targets for further functional studies. we provide insights into the evolutionary conservation of r. microplus mirnas revealing that the majority of anciently acquired mirnas remain perfectly conserved, while more recently acquired mirnas tend to accumulate more nucleotide substitutions in the middle and 3' portion of mature mirna and mirna* sequences. our findings correlates with the notion that long-lived mirnas are likely to play crucial roles in a wide range of animal species, probably closely related to the acquisition of new organ identities and higher complexity, and therefore be under a stronger selective pressure to remain unchanged as compared to more recently acquired mirnas.
