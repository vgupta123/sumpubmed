BACKGROUND
most common diseases, including allergy and diabetes, are complex. the genetic susceptibility of an individual to such a disease appears not to be the result of a single causative gene but rather arises from multiple interacting genes. the identification of novel disease-associated genes is complicated not only by the large number of potentially relevant genes as well as the heterogeneity of the diseases. one approach to address this complexity is to arrange disease-associated genes in networks, where the genes form nodes and the interactions between the genes are represented by links between the nodes. since disease genes tend to interact  <cit>  the investigation may be facilitated by searching for sub-networks of co-expressed and interacting genes . the rationale behind this is that in gene interaction networks, functionally related genes tend to form modules of tightly interacting genes  <cit> . thus, such modules give an overview of the main disease mechanisms and could thus be dissected to find novel genes  <cit> . it is not known if such a module-based analysis is generally applicable to complex diseases that are caused by altered interactions between many different cell types and tissues. the hypothesis of this study was that such a module could be a) found and validated in allergic disease and b) used to find and validate one or more novel disease-associated genes . allergy was chosen as a model of complex diseases because the main disease process is known and readily examined in both clinical and experimental studies; an allergen causes increased release of cytokines from type  <dig> t helper  cells which activate b cells, eosinophils and mast cells to release inflammatory proteins  <cit> . this disease process is thought to be common to different forms of allergy, such as seasonal allergic rhinitis , atopic eczema and asthma. it involves many well-documented genes that can be used as references to validate the bioinformatic analyses as well as to construct modules of co-expressed and interacting genes. moreover, since disease genes tend to interact, interactions with known disease genes can be used as a criterion to select novel genes for functional validation. however, several observations indicate more complex disease mechanisms than implied by the th <dig> induced disease process. many other cell types and tissues have been implicated and genomic high-throughout studies have shown the involvement of hundreds of genes. several of these genes do not appear to overlap in different forms of allergy or to have roles that can be explained by the th <dig> paradigm  <cit> .

based on the underlying principle that disease-associated genes tend to interact, we first identified a gene with a key regulatory role for the disease. this was used as a reference gene to construct a module and then dissected that to find the novel gene that had most interactions with known disease-associated genes. this was achieved by combining integrated analysis of gene expression microarray data with experimental studies.

we propose that these module-based analytical principles may be generally applicable to find novel genes in complex diseases.

RESULTS
the hypothesis of this study has been that a module of disease-associated genes could be found and validated in allergic disease, and then used to find and validate one or more novel disease genes. a step-wise analytical approach was employed :

first, a gene with key regulatory role for the disease was identified based on converging data from integrated analysis of gene expression microarray data from allergic patients and healthy controls, information in the literature and experimental validation studies. next, this gene was used to build a hypothetical module of genes co-regulated by the same transcription factors . the underlying assumption was that functionally related genes, such as those in a pathway or a module, are often co-regulated by the same tfs. the tfs and their target genes were identified and organized into a module by combining comparative promoter analysis, gene expression data and known gene interactions. this hypothetical module was tested in an independent material, by examining if the expression changes of the module genes could be replicated. finally, the module was searched for a novel disease gene that was validated by functional studies.

1) identification of disease-associated genes by integrated analysis of gene expression microarray data from cells and tissues from patients with different forms of allergy and healthy controls
combinatorial algorithms were used to extract groups of highly inter-connected genes  from graphs derived from transcriptomal correlation matrices containing millions of correlate pairs  <cit> . this resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes that will henceforth be referred to as disease-associated genes.

2) identification of a common pathway among the disease-associated genes
a manually curated pathway database  was used to identify pathways among the disease-associated genes . ipa is a bioinformatics program that is based on manual review of more than  <dig>  scientific publications. the resulting network of direct physical, transcriptional, and enzymatic interactions between mammalian orthologues was used as a template to organize the disease-associated genes into statistically scored pathways. the pathway that received the highest statistical score was t cell receptor  signaling , which included genes belonging to the tcr complex  as well as down-stream genes, zap <dig>  lat, lck and itk. in addition, the remaining disease-associated genes were searched for genes that had direct interactions with those generated by the pathway database. three other disease-associated genes fulfilled this criterion, namely ikbkg  <cit> , lef <dig>  <cit> , and map4k <dig>  <cit> . the above mentioned genes will henceforth be referred to as tcr pathway genes.

3) identification and experimental validation of a reference gene in the tcr pathway
this step aimed to find a reference gene in the tcr pathway that in the next step would be used to build a hypothetical module of functionally related disease genes. we proceeded by examining the tcr pathway in allergen-challenged cd4+ cells from patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis . gene expression microarray analyses of these cells showed a more than a two-fold increase in expression of six of the tcr pathway genes; cd3d, cd3z, lck, itk, zap <dig> and map4k <dig>  of these, itk was selected as a putative reference gene because of its involvement in the polarization of th <dig> cells and its location in a chromosomal susceptibility region for allergy, 5q31- <dig>  <cit> . the functional role of itk was explored in an in vivo mouse model of allergic inflammation in the upper and lower airways. allergen challenge resulted in a marked goblet cell hyperplasia in bronchi and bronchioles . this response was significantly reduced in similarly treated itk-/- animals. in both upper and lower airways the allergen exposure led to eosinophilia that was significantly reduced in itk-/- mice .

4) identification of transcription factors that regulated itk
functionally related genes, such as those in a pathway or a module, are often co-regulated by the same transcription factors . thus, if the tf that regulated itk and other genes of the tcr pathway could be identified this information could be used to find other disease-associated genes and organize them into a hypothetical disease module. comparative promoter analysis revealed a framework of tf binding sites that was shared by itk and two other tcr pathway genes, cd3d and lef <dig> . the framework contained tfbs for tf of the gata, myb and myt <dig> families . gene expression microarray analysis showed that the corresponding tf, namely gata <dig>  myb and mybl <dig> increased in allergen-challenged cd4+ cells . to filter out the tf that was most relevant for th <dig> polarization we analysed their correlations with itk in gene expression microarray data from cd4+ cells from  <dig> atopic patients and  <dig> non-atopic controls. the correlations between itk to gata <dig>  myb and mybl <dig> were r =  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. because gata <dig> had the highest correlation coefficient it was chosen to construct a hypothetical module as described below.

5) construction of a hypothetical module of genes co-regulated by gata3
since functionally related genes are often co-regulated by the same tf, we used gata <dig> to construct a hypothetical module. we started by identifying  <dig> genes previously described to interact with gata <dig>  to filter out those of the interacting genes that were relevant for human cd4+ cells we again analyzed the gene expression microarray data from the cd4+ cells from the  <dig> atopic patients and  <dig> non-atopic controls. genes whose expression values correlated with gata <dig>  were considered as hypothetical module genes. this resulted in a module that comprised  <dig> genes, several of which had key roles in allergic disease, for example ifng and il4r .

6) validation of the hypothetical module
to validate the module we hypothesized that the module genes would show significant gene expression changes in an independent material of allergen-challenged cd4+ cells from  <dig> patients with sar. indeed, out of  <dig> genes that had detectable levels,  <dig> did change significantly. these genes formed a tightly connected module with an average of  <dig> Â±  <dig> interactions/gene . since glucocorticoids are effective in treating allergic inflammation we hypothesized that this treatment would significantly reverse the expression levels of the  <dig> module genes. indeed,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes satisfied this hypothesis.

7) identification and validation of a novel disease gene in the module
eleven of the  <dig> module genes that had been validated by the independent gene expression microarray study  had not been previously been described in allergic diseases. these were eed, esr <dig>  grpr <dig>  hsdp <dig>  il7r, lef <dig>  maf, ptprj, runx <dig>  tcf <dig>  and sh2d1a. since disease-associated genes tend to interact  <cit>  we computed the number of interactions between each of these eleven genes and the remaining, known disease-associated genes. the average number of interactions was  <dig>  Â±  <dig> . il7r had the highest number of interactions  that included signature genes for th <dig> activation like il4r and ifng. the expression levels of il7r were lower in allergen-challenged cd4+ cells compared to diluent-treated cells from patients, while treatment with corticosteroids increased the expression of il7r . gene expression microarray analysis of an independent material of allergen-challenged cd4+ cells from patients and healthy controls, also showed lower expression in patients,  <dig> Â±  <dig> vs.  <dig> Â±  <dig> . these findings suggested the hypothesis that il-7r signaling would inhibit the activation of th <dig> cells. to test this hypothesis we examined if il- <dig> would decrease production of the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig> from allergen-challenged pbmcs from allergic patients. however, il- <dig> stimulation had the opposite effect; a 3-fold increased production of il- <dig>   <dig>  Â±  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  pg/ml, p <  <dig>  . similarly, the th <dig> cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> also increased following il- <dig> stimulation . this suggested an alternative hypothesis, namely that il-7r signaling also activated th <dig> cells, but to a higher degree than that of th <dig> cells, thereby causing a shift in the balance between th1/th <dig> cells towards a th <dig> polarization. indeed, il- <dig> treatment caused a 7-fold increase of ifn-Î³,  <dig> Â±  <dig> compared to  <dig> Â±  <dig> pg/ml, p <  <dig>  . to measure the effect of il- <dig> on the th1/th <dig> balance the ratio between il-4/ifn-Î³- <dig> was computed; this ratio decreased significantly in allergen-challenged cd4+ cells that were treated with il- <dig> compared to untreated cells,  <dig> compared to  <dig>  p <  <dig>  . thus, by a relatively higher th <dig> than th <dig> stimulation il- <dig> signaling had a th <dig> polarizing effect, which is consistent with an inhibitory role of il-7r in allergic inflammation.

discussion
identification of novel genes in high-throughput studies of complex diseases may require choosing between hundreds of genes. since disease genes tend to interact with each other  <cit>  the choice may be facilitated by searching for modules of disease genes that are co-expressed and interact  <cit> .

it is not known if the module-based analytical strategy can also be applied to complex diseases other than cancer, which result from altered interactions between multiple cells and tissues. the hypothesis in this study was that we could find and validate a disease module in allergic disease and use this to find a novel disease gene.

in a recent study of breast cancer four known disease genes were used as references to construct a module of disease genes  <cit> . however, since allergy involves many different cells and tissues such an approach would result in a large number of reference genes to prioritize between. we therefore first performed an integrated analysis of gene expression microarray data from different forms of allergic diseases to find a common pathway. that pathway was used to find a reference gene for module construction. t cell receptor  signaling was the pathway with the highest statistical score. while many of the genes in the tcr pathway had not been previously described in human allergic disease, this pathway is in accordance with the current understanding that t cells play a key regulatory role in the disease  <cit> . on the other hand, it is important to emphasize the limitations of the study, for example that important low-abundance genes such as many cytokines are not detectable by gene expression microarray analyses. only a small proportion of the different cells and tissues involved in allergic diseases were examined. also, pathways other than tcr signaling may be important for the disease. finally, the identification of pathways is restricted by current knowledge of gene functions and interactions.

we proceeded to study the tcr pathway genes in cd4+ cells from patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis . this lead to the identification of six differentially expressed genes, all of which could potentially be used as putative reference genes. however, in order to select one we focused on itk, because of its involvement in the polarization of th <dig> cells and its location in a chromosomal susceptibility region for allergy  <cit> . the relevance of itk was validated in a mouse model of allergy. the number inflammatory cells in both the upper and lower airways was significantly decreased in allergen-challenged itk-/- compared to wild type mice. next, we identified and validated a transcription factor  that was shared by itk and two other tcr pathway genes. this tf, gata <dig>  was used to construct a hypothetical module based on known gene interactions and co-expression data. this module contained a set of genes involved not only in tcr signaling, but also th <dig> cell differentiation and homing. however, rather than being organized in distinct pathways these genes were highly interconnected. this suggests that complex cellular behavior like th <dig> cell homing and activation is based on the co-regulation of genes from different pathways by common tf such as gata <dig> 

validation studies showed that the module could be replicated in an independent material. moreover, since corticosteroids are effective in treating allergic disease we tested if this treatment would also reverse the expression levels of the genes that had changed after allergen-challenge. indeed, this was true for a significant proportion of the module genes. taken together these findings lent strong support for our hypothesis that a relevant module could be found and validated in allergic disease.

we also hypothesized that the module could be used to identify a novel disease gene. indeed, eleven of the  <dig> module genes had not been previously described in allergy, but may have important roles. for example, sh2d1a that promotes th <dig> activation  <cit>  increased in expression following allergen-challenge. however, while there are several options for functional studies of individual genes, it is less clear how to select one for such studies. recent work indicates that genes with many interactions are functionally more important than those with few interactions  <cit> . we therefore reasoned that since disease genes tend to interact the novel gene that had most interactions with known disease genes would be most likely to be pathogenic. analysis of the connectivity of the novel genes led to the identification of il7r, whose relevance was supported by converging observations; il7r's interactions included two signature genes for th <dig> and th <dig> activation, namely ifng and il4r  <cit> ; the expression levels of il7r showed highly significant decreases in the allergen-challenged cd4+ cells which were reversed by treatment with corticosteroids. such expression changes are characteristic for genes that inhibit allergic inflammation  <cit> . these observations led to the hypothesis that il7r inhibited th <dig> cell activation. to test this hypothesis we treated allergen-challenged cells with il- <dig>  however, this resulted in increased rather than decreased il- <dig> production, indicating that il- <dig> activated th <dig> cells. we therefore hypothesized that il- <dig> stimulation would result in a relatively stronger activation of th <dig> than th <dig> cells. indeed, il- <dig> did cause an increased production of the th <dig> cytokine ifn-Î³, which significantly decreased the ratio between il-4/ifn-Î³. thus, by inducing a relatively higher th <dig> than th <dig> activation, il- <dig> signaling has a th <dig> like effect, which is consistent with an inhibitory role of il-7r in allergic inflammation. this has not been previously described, but increased expression of il7r has been shown in th1-like disorders like multiple sclerosis  <cit> . this suggests that this gene may have therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases that depend on an altered balance between th <dig> and th <dig> cells.

the identification of il7r in this study also supports the second hypothesis, namely that a module-based approach can be applied to find novel genes. it is also of note that although there is limited information about gene interactions, analyzing the number of interactions with known disease genes is a useful complementary method to prioritize between novel module genes for validation studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of novel genes by high-throughput studies of complex diseases is complicated by the large number of potential genes. since disease genes tend to interact, one solution is to arrange them in modules based on co-expression data and known gene interactions. in this study we validated the hypothesis that such a module could be a) found and validated in allergic disease and b) used to find and validate one ore more novel disease genes. we propose that the analytical principles may be generally applicable to complex diseases.
