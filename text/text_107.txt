BACKGROUND
genetic vaccination with plasmid dna expression vectors encoding the sequence of a specific antigen offers a promising and practical approach for the induction of protective immunity. this type of vaccine has been shown to induce a protective immune response against viral  <cit> , bacterial  <cit>  and parasitic  <cit>  diseases in a broad range of species and has several important advantages over commercial vaccines, both subunit and live attenuated. first of all, they induce major histocompatibility complex  class i restricted cd8+ t-cell responses  <cit> . secondly, sufficient quantities of plasmid dna can easily be produced in a relatively cost-effective manner, after which the vaccine can be stored with relative ease  <cit> . furthermore, dna vaccines may overcome inherent unresponsiveness in neonatal animals and function in the presence of maternally derived immunity  <cit> .

however, not withstanding these advantages, some reservations for commercial application remain. first, integration of the injected plasmid dna into the genome of the host cell could occur  <cit> . secondly, repeated injections could lead to an immunological tolerance  <cit>  or induce autoimmunity  <cit> . thirdly, injected dna could induce an immune response against the plasmid backbone  <cit> . finally, while the advantage of a long-time persistence probably provides a long-term production and presentation of the protein to the immune system, there is a risk of plasmid dna residue in the poultry meat used for human consumption. to address these last issues, we studied the persistence and expression of pcdna1::momp, a plasmid dna expression vector encoding the 'major outer membrane protein'  of chlamydophila psittaci serovar d strain 92/ <dig>  <cit>  after intramuscular injection in commercial turkeys. c. psittaci, a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium, is highly prevalent on european turkey farms and causes respiratory infections. this results in substantial economic losses due to expensive antibiotic treatment, weight loss, increased mortality and condemnation at slaughter  <cit> . up to now, no vaccine is available for c. psittaci in birds. however, previous studies have extensively shown the elicited immune response and protection of pcdna1::momp against c. psittaci infection in turkeys  <cit> . the duration of the momp expression  after intramuscular injection has not been studied yet.

RESULTS
detection of the plasmid dna by pcr analysis
in order to assess the detection limit  of the pcr, a ten-fold dilution series of the plasmid dna  was prepared. the pcr reaction was conducted as described in methods. the results indicated that the lower pcr detection limit was  <dig>  fg of plasmid dna . next, the same pcr reaction was performed on dna isolates of the tissue samples taken at euthanasia. all pcr results for the dna isolates of the muscle tissues at the injection site were positive  up to  <dig> weeks p.v. at  <dig> weeks p.v. only  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates was positive. at  <dig> weeks p.v. none of the isolates were positive, even after using a higher amount of plasmid dna to conduct the pcr. at  <dig> weeks p.v. two out of  <dig> isolates were positive. at  <dig> weeks p.v. none of the isolates were positive. the injected black ink could be detected up to  <dig> weeks p.v. however, at  <dig> weeks p.v. the injection site could no longer be visualised by the black ink and sampling became more random . no dna vaccine could be detected in the opposite  muscle tissue of the vaccinated turkeys or in the site of the same thigh, but remote from the injection site, during the entire length of the experiment .

ompa expression analyses
rna was isolated from the pooled muscle samples , as well as from the non-vaccinated muscle tissue and the spleen of the vaccinated turkeys. an rt-pcr was performed  <dig> times on the same rna sample. a pcr product was detected in all samples taken at the injection site, until  <dig> weeks p.v. no pcr product could be detected at the day of vaccination or at  <dig> weeks p.v. . no pcdna1::momp-specific mrna could be detected in the non-vaccinated muscle tissue of the vaccinated turkeys  nor in the spleen .

in situ immunodetection of the expressed momp
there was no rmomp expression  detected in the negative control, nor in the non-vaccinated muscle tissue of the other thigh. on the other hand, rmomp could be detected in all cryosections of the vaccinated muscle tissue up to the end of the experiment,  <dig> weeks p.v. . figure  <dig> shows the presence of the stained rmomp  in muscle tissue , at the site of injection at  <dig> weeks p.v.

discussion
this study is the first to prove a prolonged presence and activity of the pcdna1::momp vaccine in turkeys. earlier studies reported a persistence of dna vaccines ranging from  <dig> days  <cit>  up to  <dig> years  <cit>  in various species. differences in persistence can be attributed to several factors such as the route of administration, the dose, the nature of the antigen, the animal species, etc. studies have shown that following intravenous, intracerebral or intranasal dna vaccination, rapid clearance was observed in mice  <cit> . however, following intramuscular  or intradermal administration, chun et al. reported persistence up to  <dig> weeks  <cit> . other studies also showed a increased persistence in mice  in comparison to chickens  after i.m. immunization with the same amount of plasmid  <cit> . the latter can be explained by the growth rate and size of the animals, as correct tissue sampling in chickens becomes more difficult as the birds grow larger. in the current experiment, tissue selection was facilitated by simultaneous injection of black ink. this allowed a more precise selection of the inoculated tissues, which could explain the prolonged persistence of the dna vaccine used in this experiment.. at  <dig> weeks p.v. however, the simultaneously injected black ink was no longer visible. probably, at this time, there was no more dna vaccine detection because the site of injection could not be retrieved. although there are currently no data available suggesting a correlation between the administered dose and the persistence, the four-fold higher dose used in the current experiment compared to the dose used by morris-downes et al. could contribute to the longer persistence  <cit> . moreover, in our experiment, higher injection volumes were used.  earlier studies showed that higher hydrostatic pressure, resulting from a higher injection volume, enhanced the uptake of plasmid dna by muscle cells  <cit> . furthermore, morris-downes et al. suggested that the nature of the antigen and its ability to induce a strong immune response could influence its persistence  <cit> . next, the choice of the promotor could also have an effect on gene expression, since davis et al. discovered a 1000-fold increase in gene expression when comparing the rous sarcoma virus  promotor to the simian virus  <dig>  promoter  <cit> . finally, in  <dig> to  <dig> week-old mice a higher gene expression was observed in comparison to  <dig> week-old mice  <cit> , so the age of the animals  can also play a role in the persistence.

CONCLUSIONS
since the lifespan of commercial turkeys is about  <dig> weeks and most c. psittaci infections occur at the age of  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> weeks  <cit> , a persistence of  <dig> weeks seems adequate. secondly, in view of social hesitance concerning dna vaccination and the resulting transgenic animals, dna vaccination should be carefully investigated. finally, previous experiments in 'specific pathogen free'  turkeys already showed partial protection against c. psittaci infection by pcdna1::momp vaccination. therefore, the main focus of further research should be on improving the elicited immune response, more specifically the cell-mediated immune response, rather than prolonging the lifespan of the plasmid.
