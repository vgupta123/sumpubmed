BACKGROUND
we briefly review the necessary background relevant for this paper. we begin by discussing the mathematical notion of curvature and algorithms to compute them for triangular meshes. we then discuss the morse-smale complex and its simplification.

mean curvature
a regular curve is defined as a twice differentiable function l:ùïÄ‚Üí‚Ñù <dig> from the unit interval to 3d space where the magnitude of the tangent equals one, ||dldt||= <dig>  <cit> . the curvature at a point t is defined as the magnitude of the second differential at t, Œ∫=||d2ldt2|| .

 <dig> and minimal Œ∫
 <dig> curvature of regular curves formed by intersecting planes rotated about the surface normal n
x with the surface. mean curvature is defined as / <dig>  mean curvature is c high at convex regions d and low at concave regions. green arrows depict surfaces normals at respective surface points



a family of regular curves through a point x on a surface ùïä is defined by a collection of planes that contain the surface normal nx at the point x and the point itself . each of these curves has an associated curvature Œ∫. for curves on surfaces, one associates a sign with the curvatures given by the dot product of the surface normal and the second differential of the regular curve. the curves with maximum and minimum curvature  are referred to as the principal curvatures at x and are denoted by Œ∫ <dig> and Œ∫ <dig> respectively.

the mean curvature at a point x, h is the mean of Œ∫ <dig> and Œ∫ <dig> i.e. h=/ <dig>  convex surfaces have positive Œ∫ <dig> and Œ∫ <dig> and therefore have positive mean curvature, whereas concave surfaces have negative mean curvature .

morse-smale complexes
the morse-smale complex is a topological data structure that is defined based on the gradients of a scalar function. given a surface ùïä and a scalar function f:ùïä‚Üí‚Ñù, the gradient of f at a point x is defined by the partial derivative with respect to the local coordinates at x i.e. ‚àáf=. a critical point is a point x in ùïä whose gradient is zero. a critical point is called non-degenerate, if the hessian, equal to the matrix of second order partial derivatives of f, is non-singular. the function f is said to be a morse function if all its critical points are non-degenerate. the index of a critical point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian. in 2d, there exist three types of critical points namely the maximum, saddle, and minimum. an integral line is a curve embedded in ùïä whose tangent aligns with the gradient at every point . integral lines originate and terminate at critical points. the morse-smale complex is a partition based on the source and the destination of the integral lines  <cit>  . the combinatorial structure of the morse-smale complex is a graph whose nodes correspond to critical points, and edges or arcs exist between the nodes if there exists an integral line that connects the corresponding critical points and their indices differ by one . the descending manifold of a maximum consists of integral lines that converge to it . similarly, the ascending manifold of a minimum consists of integral lines that diverge from it. to deal with noisy functions, the morse-smale complex may be simplified by the process of topological simplification, which locally modifies the function to remove saddle-minimum or saddle-maximum pairs . after simplification the descending manifold of a canceled maximum is merged with the descending manifold of the maximum connected to the canceled saddle . it is often sufficient to directly obtain a simplified morse-smale complex instead of modifying the function in order to extract and analyze features. ordering of simplification pairs is crucial in determining the resulting structure. the theory of topological persistence is a common choice for ordering of pairs for simplification  <cit> . persistence-directed simplification iteratively eliminates arcs in the combinatorial structure with smallest absolute difference in function value and terminates when a specified simplification threshold is achieved.

methods
in this section we describe the design of ms3align in detail. the tool ms3align comprises of multiple stages where the primary input is the two surfaces represented as triangle meshes. figure  <dig> depicts the various stages. in the following sections each stage is explained in detail.
fig.  <dig> 
ms3align comprises of five stages. p and q are input surfaces represented as triangle meshes. i mean curvature is computed for both surfaces. ii significant landmarks are extracted by first computing the morse-smale complex of the curvature field and then simplifying the morse-smale complex using topological persistence. the maxima that survive simplification  are used as landmark points. iii correspondences between landmark points on either surface is established by comparing the multi-scale curvature vectors. iv a graph is constructed where each landmark correspondence is considered as a node, and edges are placed between nodes if they satisfy inequalities  and . each maximal clique in this graph generates a maximal correspondence set. v each maximal correspondence set is evaluated using the measure given by . those evaluating to the smallest values are ranked as the best alignments



curvature computation
the mean curvature at every vertex of the two input surfaces p and q is computed in the first stage.

there exist many algorithms to estimate the mean curvature of triangle meshes. we use the algorithm based on the theory of normal cycles by cohen-steiner et al.  <cit> . we choose this approach for two reasons. first, this algorithm guarantees linear convergence to the curvature of a smooth surface, with a sufficiently well sampled set of points.

second, the definition of the curvature is based on averaging the curvature tensor over a neighborhood of size rc on the triangle mesh. this allows for a smoother estimate of the mean curvature where meshing artifacts are overcome by the averaging operation. good selection of the neighborhood size rc for curvature computation is crucial to avoid isotropy issues introduced by mesh discretization. for computing a smooth curvature estimate at each vertex, we find that the neighborhood size rc needs to span at least two rings of vertices. the maxima of mean curvature correspond to the protrusions on each surface patch.

landmark extraction
in the second stage, landmark points, representing significant protrusions of both surfaces p and q, are identified from the maxima of the mean curvature scalar field. however, several maxima may correspond to regions with low mean curvature. significant protrusions are identified by a topological analysis using the morse-smale complex of the mean curvature field. segmenting molecular surfaces using the morse-smale complex has been reported earlier  <cit>  using the connolly function  <cit> , which is related to the surface curvature.

the morse-smale complex of the mean curvature field is first computed  <cit>  and then simplified by iteratively canceling insignificant maxima using the topological cancellation procedure.

the significance of a maximum is determined by the notion of topological persistence  <cit>  where each maximum is paired with a saddle critical point. the measure of significance of a maximum, referred to as its persistence, is the absolute difference in mean curvature value of the maximum and its paired saddle critical point. thus, maxima are eliminated in increasing order of persistence up to a given threshold, denoted by ts. the threshold ts is specified as a fraction of the average of the mean curvature at all local maxima.

landmark correspondences
in the third stage, correspondences between pairs of landmark points on either surface p and q is established. this is done by analysis of the curvature at multiple scales. the mean curvature computed using a neighborhood size rc gives an estimate of curvature at that scale. we compute mean curvature at multiple scales at each landmark point p‚ààp and q‚ààq. we use  <dig> uniformly sampled curvature scales from the interval . landmark points p‚ààp and q‚ààq are declared as a corresponding pair  if the absolute difference between their mean curvatures at every scale is bounded by a threshold tms. the threshold tms is specified as a fraction similar to ts.

maximal correspondence sets
in the fourth stage, correspondences between landmark points in p and q are collected into maximal sets of correspondences. a maximal set ‚ÑÇ:=,,‚Ä¶, is constructed so that for each pair of correspondences  and , the two landmark points pi and pj in p have relative pairwise geometric properties similar to that of the two landmark points qi and qj in q. we use two geometric properties to establish relative pairwise similarity. first, we ensure that the absolute difference between the distances of the two landmarks on either surface is less than a threshold tmrd, referred to as the maximum relative distance threshold. second, we ensure that the absolute difference in the angles between the surface normals of two landmarks on either surface is less than œÄ/ <dig>  in other words, for a given maximal set ‚ÑÇ:=,,‚Ä¶,, we ensure that 
  |‚à•pi‚àípj‚à•‚àí‚à•qi‚àíqj‚à•|<tmrd 

  |cos‚àí <dig> n)‚àícos‚àí <dig> n)|<œÄ/ <dig> 

for all ,‚àà‚ÑÇ, where n represents the surface normal at point p. the constructed sets are maximal in the sense that no other correspondence may be added without violating conditions  and .

finding maximal correspondence sets may be recast as the problem of enumerating maximal cliques in graphs. the nodes of the graph are correspondences between landmark points . edges exist between pairs of correspondences  and  if they satisfy conditions  and  and if p‚â†p‚Ä≤ as well as q‚â†q‚Ä≤. maximal correspondence sets are found by enumerating maximal cliques from this graph.

we use the greedy pivot heuristic modification of the bron-kerbosch algorithm  <cit>  by koch  <cit>  to enumerate maximal cliques in this graph. this modification exhibits near linear complexity in the number of maximal cliques for most graphs.

indeed, the total number of maximal correspondence sets may be exponential in the number of landmark points. the number of maximal correspondence sets depends on the tolerance for positional uncertainty of the landmark points, captured by tmrd, as well as the number of correspondences, captured by tms. choosing a very small tms and tmrd causes the algorithm to demand near exact matches in the mean curvature as well as the relative positions of the landmarks, whereas higher values allow larger variations.

surface alignment
in the final stage, each maximal correspondence set is first used to determine a rigid body transformation  from p to q via a least squares minimization  <cit> .

next, for each correspondence set ‚ÑÇ:=, ,‚Ä¶,}, we compute a measure dp,q that quantifies the error of the transformation , given by 
  dp,q‚Ä≤:=‚àëi=1nap‚à•‚àíqi‚à•2apap/apdp,q:=mindp,q‚Ä≤,dq,p‚Ä≤ 

here, ap is the area of the descending manifold of pi, ap is the total area of all landmarks of p in ‚ÑÇ i.e. ap:=‚àëi=1na, and ap is the area of p. also, dp,q is a symmetric version of dp,q‚Ä≤, where dq,p‚Ä≤ inverts the roles of p and q in dp,q‚Ä≤ with the exception that the transformation  is again applied only to landmarks in p.

the numerator of dp,q‚Ä≤ in eq.  represents a coarse approximation of the rms distance between the matching portions of both surfaces. the denominator is the fraction of the area of descending manifolds of all landmark points of p in ‚ÑÇ with respect to the total area of p. due to the denominator, correspondence sets having larger area fractions are preferred.

maximal correspondence sets that result in the least values of this measure are reported along with their transformations. computing this measure is efficient even with a large numbers of maximal correspondence sets since it only requires landmarks and not all points on the surface. it is possible for some spurious correspondence sets consisting of a few landmarks to align nearly perfectly. hence, we consider only those correspondence sets so that the area of the corresponding regions of either surface is at least  <dig> % of its total area.

parameter selection
the four parameters rc, ts, tms and tmrd control the performance of the ms3align algorithm. while the parameters rc and ts control the quality of the landmarks, the parameters tmrd and tms control how these landmarks are aligned. the expected size/scale of features must have direct bearing on the choice of rc and tmrd because they are distance values . hence, this choice depends on the dataset being studied. by default, we assume tmrd to be equal to rc. if this results in an insufficient number of landmark alignments, then tmrd may be set to a higher value. conversely, if we expect or desire less relative movement of feature points, then it is set o a lower value. the parameters ts and tms are specified in a normalized scale of positive curvature values. hence, we explicitly conducted performance experiments  to determine good choices of these parameters. based on these experiments, we determine that ts= <dig>  is a good choice. by default, we assume tms to be equal to ts. again, in case there are insufficient number of landmark alignments, tms may be set to a higher value. conversely, if there are fewer or larger number of feature points, ts may be lowered or raised as desired. however, changing the value drastically will result in either oversimplification or undersimplification, both of which results in poor quality of feature points.

to illustrate the consequence of these choices, we present fig.  <dig>  the two panels show landmarks computed for the molecule with pdb id 4gh <dig> with rc set to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the columns in each panel show the landmark points for values of ts equal to  <dig>  and  <dig> . each row shows the landmarks on the surfaces without noise and with noise  added to the atom locations. the mean-curvature computed is shown using a color map. comparing two panels directly, the effect of rc is evident in the density of the landmarks. the choice of rc= <dig>  is inappropriate here as significant protrusions are not captured effectively. raising the simplification threshold to ts= <dig>  does not resolve the issue. furthermore, with the addition of noise, the corresponding change in landmarks is hard to distinguish. in contrast, in the right panel where rc= <dig> , landmarks representing significant protrusions are retained across simplification thresholds of  <dig>  and  <dig>  furthermore, it is possible to visually establish the correspondences between the landmarks across the noiseless and noisy versions, particularly with ts is set to  <dig> .

RESULTS
in this section we discuss our evaluation of ms3align. we begin with a discussion on the molecular surfaces used in our experiments . in the first experiment , we evaluate its performance under conditions of noise, partial overlap, and running times using a random set of  <dig> proteins from the pdb  <cit> . in the second experiment , we compare ms3align with the results discussed in the evaluation of surfcomp  <cit> . as the molloc web-server  <cit>  and the code from  <cit>  is unavailable, we could not compare our results with theirs. in the third experiment , we validate the alignments of binding sites computed by ms3align comparing them with those generated using pymol  <cit> . here, we quantify the structural variation of binding sites using pocketmatch  <cit> .

in the fourth experiment , we use ms3align to compute alignments of iso-surfaces extracted from cryo-electron microscopy scans.

molecular surfaces
in our experiments, we use three types of surfaces extracted from proteins/ligands obtained from the pdb  <cit>  which are built upon the van der waals molecular model. the first type is the molecular skin surface   <cit> . the second type of surface used is the ligand surface, which is representative of the ligand interacting with the protein in a protein-ligand interaction obtained from the pdb  <cit>  . the third kind of surface used is the pocket surface . this is representative of the surface of interaction of the protein with the ligand. additionally, we generate partially overlapping surfaces by cutting skin surfaces to generate pairs of surfaces with approximately known overlap fractions .

skin surface
the molecular skin surface is a mathematically robust surface model that is similar in geometry to the solvent excluded surface. the molecular skin surface of a protein is computed in two steps. first, its atomic locations are augmented with the van der waals radii after adding missing hydrogen atoms using the pdb2pqr tool  <cit> . next, the skin surface is extracted using the nanoshaper tool  <cit>  using the atomic locations and radii as input.

ligand surface
the ligand surface is computed in three steps. first, the chimera  <cit>  program is used to extract the molecular structure of the ligand from the protein‚Äôs pdb file. then, together with the protein‚Äôs pdb file, the molecular structure of the ligand is used to determine atomic positions and radii of the ligand using the pdb2pqr tool. finally, the ligand position and radii data is used to compute the skin surface of the ligand using nanoshaper.

pocket surface
the pocket surface is extracted as a subset of the molecular skin surface of the protein. this subset is the part of the surface that belongs to the residues  that interact with the ligand. these residues are referred to as the pocket residues or just the pocket. a subset of the molecular surface is extracted so that all vertices of the subset are within the van der waals sphere of at least one of the atoms of the pocket. an additional  <dig> √Ö is added to the van der waals sphere to account for the possible error introduced when extracting the skin surface, because nanoshaper uses a structured grid with edge length  <dig> √Ö. this subset surface may be disconnected and/or contain holes. this topological noise is repaired using a variant of the dilation-erosion operation applied to triangle meshes  <cit> . the radius for both steps is set to  <dig> √Ö, the radius of the hydrogen atom.

partially overlapping surfaces
in this section, we describe in detail our approach for the generation of overlapping skin surface pairs with approximately known overlap fractions. each skin surface is split by a pair of planes into two surfaces such that they overlap with each other with an approximately known overlap fraction . pairs of surfaces are generated for overlap fractions of approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> % of each other. to do this, first, a coordinate system about the centroid of the molecule is constructed from the principal components of the centroid subtracted positions of the surface‚Äôs vertices  <cit> . the plane containing the first two principal components is rotated about the second component by  <dig>  œÄ/ <dig>  2œÄ/ <dig>  3œÄ/ <dig> and 4œÄ/ <dig> radians to obtain five planes, each of which slice the surface into two pieces. the piece on the right of each plain is retained to generate five partial surfaces. the first partial surface overlaps with the other four partial surface with approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> % of its area.
fig.  <dig> pairs of surfaces which overlap with each other with an approximately known fraction of area of each other are generated by cutting the molecular skin surface using a pair of planes. here, the skin surface of 4j2m  is cut by two planes into two pieces  such that  <dig> % of the area of either overlaps with the other



performance analysis
in this experiment, we study three aspects of ms3align. first, we study its ability to determine correct alignments in the presence of noise. second, we study its ability to detect alignments in the presence of partial overlaps. finally, we study the runtime performance of ms3align. we use twenty structurally different proteins from the pdb  <cit>  having 1500‚Äì <dig> atoms.

we set the parameter rc=3√Ö. this enables landmarks to be located on protrusions of 2‚Äì <dig> atoms, which is typical of groups such as ammonium, hydroxy, and methyl that are close to the surface. we set the parameter tmrd=1√Ö. alignments are studied with varying choices of the ts parameter. the tms parameter is set to be equal to the ts parameter.

we now study performance of ms3align in the presence of noise. noise is introduced by adding standard gaussian noise of known variance to all atom locations of the protein. the molecular skin surface of this perturbed molecule is used as the noisy version of the surface. multiple such noisy versions of the skin surface are generated by adding increasing levels of noise. the level of noise is quantified by computing the rms distance of all atoms from their original position to their position after adding noise. we compute the rms distance between the two surfaces by mapping each vertex of the original surface to the closest vertex in the noisy surface after alignment.

we conclude that the alignment is successful if the rms distance is within 2√Ö. the top row of fig.  <dig> shows three graphs for respective simplification threshold ts values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .
fig.  <dig> 
 rms distance between skin surfaces of various molecules after each surface is aligned with noisy versions of itself shown for t
s= <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the y-axis is log-scaled beyond 2√Ö.  rms distance between a subset of the skin surface and four other surfaces that it partially overlaps with. the y-axis is log-scaled beyond 1√Ö




with a ts threshold of  <dig> , we observe that surfaces align with rms distance approximately equal to the rms distance between the noisy and noiseless surfaces up to 1√Ö. we also observe that most alignments fail after the introduced noise causes rms distance between surfaces to be more than 1√Ö. a primary reason for this is the choice of the maximum relative distance threshold tmrd=1√Ö, which specifies the amount acceptable relative movement of the landmark points.

we next study the ability of ms3align to detect alignments in the presence of partial overlaps. five partially overlapping surfaces are generated as subsets of the skin surface. the first surface is generated by a cut plane that partitions the skin surface. the remaining surfaces are also generated by rotated cut planes such that the overlap fractions with the first surface is approximately  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively. in other words, the first and second partial surfaces intersect in approximately  <dig> % of the area of each other, the first and third intersect in approximately  <dig> % of the areas of each other, and so on. since we already know the transformation that aligns the first partial surface with the others, namely the identity transformation, we study the rms distance from the first partial surface after applying the the alignment transformation determined by ms3align. the bottom row of fig.  <dig> shows three graphs for respective simplification threshold ts values of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . the alignment rms distance of the first partial surface is mapped to the y-axis and the overlap fractions with the remaining four partial surfaces is mapped to the x-axis. we find that, in all cases, alignments were successfully determined with rms distance less than 1√Ö.

next, we present the runtime breakup of the various stages of ms3align in fig.  <dig>  we conducted our experiments on a hp xw <dig> workstation with an intel xeon cpu e <dig>  <dig>  ghz dual quad-core processor and  <dig> gb of ram. for efficient computation, the tool contains openmp directives which can be optionally enabled to leverage multi-core computation. we disable it for this experiment to run the tool on a single core, thereby enabling us to compare with other sequential methods. fig.  <dig> presents the running times for the partial overlap experiment discussed above for a simplification threshold parameter ts value of  <dig> . we note from the figure that the alignment time is consistently under  <dig> s for each set of four alignments. in comparison, surfcomp takes about  <dig> s  for each comparison for their small ligand datasets using a  <dig>  ghz intel xeon processor. baum and hege  <cit>  report a runtime of 5‚Äì <dig> s on a  <dig>  ghz intel xeon processor for comparison of one ligand with six others. merelli et al.  <cit>  report that their method takes between a few seconds to about  <dig> min for a good match of a pair of surfaces on an intel dual core machine. angaran et al. report that moloc takes between few seconds to minutes for medium sized binding surface areas.
fig.  <dig> stacked bar graph showing breakup of ms3align run-times for the surfaces used in the partial overlap study. the time taken for alignment  is significantly lesser than time taken for the first and second stage



a comparison with surfcomp
in this experiment, we compare ms3align with the surfcomp tool  <cit> . the authors of surfcomp validate using the ligand surfaces from two datasets. the first dataset consists of thermolysin inhibitor ligands of two kinds, the first containing tryptophan and the second with an aliphatic residue at the c-terminal end. the second dataset consists of ligands bound with the dihydrofolate reductase  enzyme.

in both experiments, surfaces obtained from ligand molecules are aligned. hofbauer et al. consider two types of physico-chemical properties on molecular surfaces to determine alignments.

since they conclude that electrostatic potential  results in better alignments, we only compare against these alignments. the chemical structures of the ligands are presented in the appendix. for these experiments, the rc parameter is set to  <dig> √Ö since we wish to study alignments at the scale of a single atom. the ts parameter is set to  <dig>  for the first dataset and  <dig>  for the second dataset. the tms parameter is set to  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the tmrd parameter is set equal to rc. in the following paragraphs, we discuss the alignments determined by ms3align for each of the datasets in detail and compare them with surfcomp.

in the thermolysin dataset, surfcomp compares eight thermolysin inhibitor ligands considered in two groups. the first group consists of ligands from pdbs 1thl, 1tlp, 1tmn and 3tmn. in our experiment, we were unable to extract the ligand structure from 3tmn because of a failure in the pdb2pqr tool which is used in a preprocessing step to compute the molecular skin surface. hence, we remove 3tmn from this list. the second group consists of ligands from pdbs 4tln, 5tln, 5tmn, and 6tmn. for consistency of labeling of datasets with respect to hofbauer et al., we use the pdb id to reference the ligand considered.

we were able to determine the same alignments as surfcomp for the first group. however, in the case of 1thl-1tmn our sixth best alignment corresponds to the surfcomp‚Äôs best alignment. for the same pair 1thl-1tmn, surfcomp reports an alignment of the tryptophan moiety of both ligands. ms3align reports it as the sixth best alignment with other meaningful alignments being detected as better. figure  <dig> shows the other alignments detected for the pair 1thl-1tmn. from the visualization, we confirm the alignments of similar chemical moieties . also, hofbauer et al. state that they were not able to determine relevant alignments of the ligand in 5tln with the other ligands. figure  <dig> show the best alignments of the ligand in 5tln with the ligands in 4tmn and 5tmn using ms3align. since the ligand 0pi  is structurally very similar to the ligand 0pj , the same alignments with respect to other ligands were also found, and thus images of these alignments are omitted. thus, we find that ms3align aligns relevant portions of the surfaces of the ligand ban in 5tln with all the other considered ligands. for many pairs, we determine partial alignments of other substructures. figure  <dig> presents the additional alignments of 4tmn with the others in its group.

in the dhfr dataset, alignments of surfaces of four ligands interacting with dhfr are analyzed. the ligands used are folic acid , methotrexate , trimethoprim , and br-wr <dig>  from pdbs 1dhf, 1df <dig>  1dg <dig> and 1dg <dig> respectively.

we note that surfcomp reports only two good alignments of fol with mtx and wrb. we were able to recover a similar alignment of fol and mtx. ms3align does not determine the same alignment reported by surfcomp for the case of fol and wrb. figure 11b shows the alignment determined by ms3align where the alignment is along the c =n‚àíc= n moieties with amino groups at the two and four positions from triazine and pteridine of wrb and mtx respectively. surfcomp reports an alignment where the brominated benzyl group of wrb aligns with the central benzyl group of fol which is different from the best alignment we determine.

a validation using pocketmatch and pymol
in this experiment, we validate alignments generated using ms3align against those generated using pymol  <cit> . here, the objective is to study the alignments against known alignments generated using pymol‚Äôs ‚Äúsuper‚Äù command. this command aligns proteins using a dynamic programming approach followed by multiple refinement cycles that improve the fit by eliminating pairings with high relative variability. we curate a dataset of thirty one protein structures from the pdb  <cit> , each interacting with one of eight types of ligands. the dataset is chosen so that the ligands represent a range of structural variability at their site of interaction. the structural variability of the pocket is quantified using pocketmatch  <cit> . for each binding site, pocketmatch generates  <dig> sorted lists of distances from the three dimensional coordinates and chemical properties of the site. for a pair of sites, a normalized score based on the similarity of the pair of  <dig> lists is computed. sites having a pocketmatch pmax score greater than  <dig>  are statistically shown to be structurally similar, with a score of  <dig> indicating identical sites. a variety of ligands ranging from small sugars such as glucose to molecules containing substituted sugars such as ndp, fatty acids such as acd , vitamins such as biotin  and retinoic acid  are chosen. in the additional file  <dig>  we provide the details pertaining to the molecules and the ligands.

for this experiment, the binding surfaces of each ligand type is aligned with each other using ms3align with rc= <dig> √Ö, ts= <dig> , tms= <dig> , tmrd= <dig> √Ö. in fig.  <dig>  the rms distance between the pockets transformed by pymol‚Äôs and ms3align‚Äôs alignment is plotted for the set of considered pocket pairs. the pocketmatch score between each pair is also shown for comparison. when the rms distance between the pockets transformed by pymol‚Äôs and ms3align‚Äôs alignment is less than  <dig> √Ö, we conclude that both alignments are equivalent. in fig.  <dig>  we visually verify the validity of alignments of pairs where the rms distance is between  <dig>  and 5√Ö. we conclude that we were able to successfully determine alignments of pocket surfaces whose pocketmatch score is greater than  <dig>  and in some cases even  <dig> .

aligning electron microscopy iso-surfaces
in this experiment, we consider two sets of related iso-surfaces generated from cryo electron microscopy scans obtained from the emdatabank  <cit> . the first dataset comprises of a related set of fragment antigen binding of hiv antibodies. the second dataset comprises of a related set of hiv antibodies. both datasets are available at resolutions of approximately 20√Ö. table  <dig> summarizes the details of the two datasets used. an iso-surface is defined as the set of points where the density value is equal to a pre-specified constant. molecular surfaces are extracted from cryo-em data by computing the iso-surface at a carefully chosen iso-value.
the iso-value refers to the density value suggested by emdata bank for representing the molecular surface



for both datasets, we set the parameter rc=30√Ö, ts= <dig> , tms= <dig> , tmrd=30√Ö, and computed alignments using ms3align. figure  <dig> shows the respective pairwise alignments of the iso-surfaces of both datasets. table  <dig> shows the rms distance between pairs surfaces from the two datasets after alignment using ms3align. here the rmsd is computed after alignment as the root mean square of the closest distance from every point of the first surface to the second surface and vice versa. thus, we conclude that the alignments were successful.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we present a method to align molecular surfaces by identifying and establishing correspondences between significant protrusions on the surface. we also present ms3align, a tool that implements this method.

a key advantage of our method is robust segmentation of the surface into segments that can be individually evaluated for correspondences. furthermore, due to its purely geometric design, it is applicable to molecular surfaces arising from various sources such as the pdb and electron-microscopy scans. this is a key advantage over existing methods such as surfcomp, pbsalign, and pymol, which rely on protein sequence data and other derived scalar values such as the electrostatic potential, which are often not directly available/computable. in the future, we plan to expand ms3align to align surfaces by including other geometric properties such as spherical harmonics and zernike coefficients of individual segments. these global properties may be applied to smaller segments resulting in a method for determining alignments using a blend of local and global properties. currently, we use only the local curvature property. another possible direction for future work is an extension towards a framework that harmoniously incorporates additional physico-chemical properties that may be available.
