BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions play a critical role in protein function. completion of many genomes is being followed rapidly by major efforts to identify experimentally interacting protein pairs in order to decipher the networks of interacting, coordinated-in-action proteins. identification of protein-protein interaction sites and detection of specific residues that contribute to the specificity and strength of protein interactions is an important problem  <cit>  with broad applications ranging from rational drug design to the analysis of metabolic and signal transduction networks. experimental detection of residues on protein-protein interaction surfaces can come either from determination of the structure of protein-protein complexes or from various functional assays. the ability to predict interface residues at protein binding sites using computational methods can be used to guide the design of such functional experiments and to enhance gene annotations by identifying specific protein interaction domains within genes at a finer level of detail than is currently possible.

computational efforts to identify protein interaction surfaces  <cit>  have been limited to date, and are needed because experimental determinations of protein structures and protein-protein complexes, lag behind the numbers of protein sequences. in particular, computational methods for identifying residues that participate in protein-protein interactions can be expected to assume an increasingly important role  <cit> . based on the different characteristics of known protein-protein interaction sites  <cit> , several methods have been proposed for predicting interface residues using a combination of sequence and structural information. these include methods based on the presence of "proline brackets" <cit> , patch analysis using a 6-parameter scoring function  <cit> , analysis of the hydrophobicity distribution around a target residue  <cit> , multiple sequence alignments  <cit> , structure-based multimeric threading  <cit> , and analysis of amino acid characteristics of spatial neighbors to a target residue using neural networks  <cit> . our recent work has focused on prediction of interface residues by utilizing analyses of sequence neighbors to a target residue using svm and bayesian classifiers  <cit> .

there is an acute need for multi-faceted approaches that utilize available databases of protein sequences, structures, protein complexes, phylogenies, as well as other sources of information for the data-driven discovery of sequence and structural correlates of protein-protein interactions  <cit> . by exploiting available databases of protein complexes, the data-driven discovery of sequence and structural correlates for protein-protein interactions offers a potentially powerful approach.

RESULTS
here we are using a dataset of  <dig> hydrolase complexes from the pdb, together with their sequence homologs. the application of our consensus method to other types of complexes, e.g. antibody-antigen complexes is currently under study and will be published later. it should be noted, however, that prediction of binding sites for other types of protein complexes, especially those involved in cell signaling, is likely to be more difficult than for the hydrolase-inhibitor complexes.

the primary amino acid sequence for proteinase b chain and the interface residue prediction results for the four individual methods and the consensus method are shown in figure  <dig>  actual interface residues are identified highlighted in red. the five lines below the amino acid sequence show the locations of interface residues predicted by the different methods : p = phylogeny; c = conservatism of conservatism ; s = data mining by svm; t = threading; e = consensus. similar figures for each protein studied in this work are provided in supplementary materials .

the prediction results for all methods are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  table  <dig> shows a complete summary of the classification performance on the proteinase b chain for all  <dig> methods including the overall sensitivity  and specificity ; sensitivity  and specificity  for interface residues ; and correlation coefficient . table  <dig> shows the overall average performance results for all seven protein complexes studied in this work. two kinds of averages are considered: the numerical average over each of  <dig> proteins in the dataset, i.e., the average on a "per protein" basis ; and the average over the total number of residues, i.e., the average on a "per residue" basis .

sequence and structure conservation
amino acid sequences are conserved for many different reasons related to the structure and function of proteins: for stability  <cit> , enzyme active sites, subunit interfaces, facilitation of an essential motion , and binding sites. developing methods to identify the reason for conservation of individual highly conserved residues is a difficult problem. this is one of the reasons that a combination of approaches may be more likely to permit identification of residues that participate in protein-protein interactions. even identifying the conserved residues themselves is not completely straightforward, and as will be seen, different approaches will indicate the same residue being conserved to different extents. in this study, we take advantage of this by using several methods to identify sequence and structure conservation. here we use two principal methods for this purpose, one based on phylogeny to identify sequence conservation and one based on conservatism of conservatism  <cit>  to identify structure conservation. these two methods often identify different residues as being conserved.

phylogeny
to identify protein residues that are conserved – perhaps due to their functional role in forming specific protein-protein interactions – we use clustalx  <cit>  multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences to generate phylogenetic trees . conserved residues are defined as those that are identical at a given position in more than 85% alignments, i.e., only 15% substitutions or gaps were allowed. this 85% cutoff value is found to give optimal results . because phylogenetic trees of closely related sequences result in many residues that satisfy this condition  we filter the results to focus on surface residues by removing conserved residues residing inside the protein core, i.e., having low solvent accessibility .

as shown in figure  <dig>  the phylogenetic method does not classify any of the amino acids in proteinase b chain  as interface residues, i.e., tp =  <dig> and fp =  <dig>  thus, for the phylogenetic method prediction, the correlation coefficient , which can range from - <dig> to + <dig>  converges to zero, whereas overall specificity converges to  <dig> . the latter misleading statistic is due to the large number of negative examples , which are correctly classified. in cases such as this , sensitivity+ and specificity+ measures are especially useful because they more clearly reflect the ability of a method to detect "positive" interface residues. . note that even though figure  <dig> shows that the phylogenetic method does not identify any interface residues in this particular example, the results summarized in table  <dig> for all seven proteins demonstrate that the ability of the phylogenetic method to correctly predict non-interface residues , and in combination with other methods, to lead to significantly improved predictions.

conservatism of conservatism
to detect structurally conserved residues that are possible binding sites we have used the conservatism of conservatism method  developed by mirny and shakhnovich <cit>  we use structural alignments generated by fssp  developed by holm and sander  <cit> ) to identify protein families with folds similar to that of the each of the  <dig> proteins. for each family, hssp  <cit>   alignments are used to calculate the sequence entropy at each position of the alignment. the hssp profile is based on the multiple alignment of a sequence and its potential structural homologues  <cit> . the structural alignment generated by fssp is used to calculate the value of coc . each residue in the protein chain was ranked according to its coc value at a given position in the sequence. the top 75% of total residues ranked according to their coc values are defined as conserved. we filter the results of the coc ranking by removing all structurally conserved residues located inside the protein core by only choosing the residues that have a relative accessibility of at least  <dig> as calculated by dssp  <cit>  . interface residues in proteinase b predicted by this method are indicated by a "c" in figure  <dig>  the overall performance of the coc method is summarized in the second row of tables  <dig> and  <dig>  although the correlation coefficient of the coc method is in the same range of those obtained by phylogeny and support vector machines,  <dig> , the sensitivity+ value,  <dig> , is surpassed only by the consensus value. therefore, a larger fraction of interface residues is predicted by coc than the other three methods. however, the coc method alone is not sufficient to successfully predict binding sites, and combining this method with other prediction techniques in the consensus method gives improved results .

data mining for binding residues
we have generated a support vector machine  classifier to determine whether or not a surface residue is located in the interaction site using information about the sequence neighbors of a target residue. an 11-residue window consisting of the residue and its  <dig> sequence neighbors  is chosen empirically. each amino acid in the  <dig> residue window is represented using  <dig> values obtained from the hssp profile of the sequence. each target residue is therefore associated with a  <dig>  element vector. the svm learning algorithm is given a set of labeled examples of the form  where x is the  <dig> element vector representing a target residue and y is its corresponding class label, either interface or non-interface residue. the svm algorithm generates a classifier which takes as input a  <dig> element vector that encodes a target residue to be classified and outputs a class label. our previous study  <cit>  reported results for classifiers constructed using a combined set of  <dig> proteins belonging to six different categories of complexes: antibody-antigen, protease-inhibitor, enzyme complexes, large protease complexes, g-proteins, cell cycle signaling proteins, signal transduction, and miscellaneous. in another study  <cit> , we trained separate classifiers for each major category of complexes . in the case of protease-inhibitor complexes, leave-one-out experiments were performed on a set of  <dig> proteins. in each experiment, an svm classifier was trained using a set of surface residues, labeled as interface or non-interface, from  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins. the resulting classifier was used to classify the surface residues of the remaining target protein into interface residue and non-interface residue categories. the interface residues obtained for 3sgb_e are reproduced in figure  <dig> and marked by "s". the performance of the svm classifier for the current test set of complexes is summarized in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the results show that svm yields relatively high sensitivity+  and specificity+ .

threading of sequences through structures of interface surfaces
structural threading was performed for the set of  <dig> protein complexes using a recently developed threading algorithm  <cit> , which was first used in the casp <dig>  <cit>  competition. for each complex structure, we first extract the interfacial region, essentially as described earlier. residue-residue contacts in the interfacial region are described with contact matrices. the total energy in this threading method is the sum of all pair-wise contact energies for the conformation. detailed residue-level contact potentials were obtained from the li, tang and wingreen  <cit>  parameterization of the miyazawa and jernigan  <cit>  matrix. we represent a protein sequence vector s by the hydrophobicity values of its amino acids hi obtained in this factorization and protein structure by the contact matrix Γ. the problem of finding the best alignment of a query sequence s with a structure having contact matrix Γ is to find the transformation from s to s' that optimizes the energy function. the optimum s' is the dominant eigenvector v <dig> of the contact matrix Γ. there is a strong correlation between a protein sequence and the dominant eigenvector of its native structure's contact matrix. here the transformation we seek is obtained by maximizing the correlation between s' and v <dig>  this is an alignment problem, and a dynamic programming method from sequence alignment has been adapted to solve this problem  <cit> .

for each sequence, threading is performed against structures in our template database and alignment results used only when the score exceeds a length-dependent threshold. from the alignments, residues involved in contacts at the interface are identified using a scale based on the number of times a particular residue is indicated and the strength of the threading score. the predicted binding sites for 3sgb_e by the threading method are marked in figure  <dig> by "t" and the prediction results are summarized in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the threading-based approach is somewhat more successful than other methods based on its sensitivity+, selectivity+, and correlation coefficient values, but still not as good as the performance obtained by combining it with methods in the consensus approach.

consensus method for predicting protein binding sites
based on the results from the predictions with the four independent methods, we have developed a simple consensus method to obtain a better prediction. in the consensus method results presented here, an amino acid is considered to be an interface residue if any of the following conditions are met:

i) at least three independent methods classify it as an "interface residue"

ii) any two methods  predict it

for this set of proteins, the parameters for combining results in the consensus method have been empirically determined without a systematic comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each method. we employ this simple approach because it provides demonstrable improvement in prediction performance over the individual methods. the consensus interface residue predictions are indicated by an "e" in figure  <dig>  and performance results are summarized in the last rows of tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the consensus method generally results in an enhanced correlation coefficient and sensitivity+, demonstrating the superior performance of the consensus method for identifying interface residues in this protein set. predictions for each protein, provided in supplementary materials , illustrate that the improvements can be even more pronounced when the individual predictions of all four methods are relatively weak. this suggests that combining diverse prediction methods may be an excellent approach for the prediction of the binding sites in protein complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
each of the four prediction methods presented in this paper sheds a different light on the conservation and prediction of protein interaction sites, but none of the methods taken separately is as powerful as the combination of all four methods. the simple consensus approach presented here could perhaps be improved by generating an ensemble predictor with more detailed probabilities. our current work is directed at this approach. it is clear that the present subject is an active field of research  <cit> .
