BACKGROUND
rust caused by melampsora larici-populina is one of the most severe diseases of poplars. rust is indigenous to eurasia and later spread to australia  <cit>  and north america  <cit> . in the far east, m. larici-populina infection occurs in a wide range of poplar species and hybrids and often causes severe damages  <cit> . it has a very complex life cycle, producing  <dig> spore stages during its life cycle and alternating on larch .

poplars  occur naturally in most parts of the northern hemisphere from subarctic to subtropical regions  <cit>  and are widely planted beyond their natural range in both the southern and northern hemispheres  <cit> . poplars and their hybrids vary in rust resistance. although hybrids of p. deltoides and p. nigra or p. trichocarpa were selected for their immunity to rust  <cit> , breakdown of the resistance to m. larici-populina in some of these cultivars was detected upon the appearance of races e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, many cultivars that had been highly resistant to rust were infected by a new race, e <dig>  <cit> . resistance and susceptibility are at opposite ends of the same spectrum, and research on disease resistance cannot be conducted without reference to susceptibility  <cit> . although great advances have been made in researching the genetic mechanisms of plant disease resistance, the mechanisms underlying plant disease susceptibility remain unclear.

populus deltoides possesses qualitative resistance to m. larici-populina  <cit> . although hybrid vigor is generally high in these cultivars, most of the hybrids exhibit high rust susceptibility once the major resistance genes inherited from p. deltoides are defeated  <cit> . in a previous study, hybrid poplar p. nigra × p. deltoides ‘robusta’ was found to have non-race-specific resistance to m. larici-populina isolates collected from england  <cit> , but the resistance was defeated by e <dig>  therefore, ‘robusta’ provides suitable host material for studies of gene regulation involved in rust resistance/susceptibility.

micrornas  play important roles in plant post-transcriptional gene regulation by repressing the translation of target mrnas or targeting them for cleavage  <cit> . in plants, mirnas regulate diverse processes, such as development  <cit> , abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> , and biotic stress  <cit> . several studies have indicated that mirnas play critical roles in disease resistance or susceptibility responses  <cit> . for example, several plant mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  are responsive to biotic stress during both resistance and susceptibility interactions . additionally, in susceptible poplar, all fungi-responsive mirnas have been found to be up-regulated in response to the infection of a canker pathogen  <cit> .

the genome sequences of both poplar  and its rust pathogen m. larici-populina have now been published  <cit> . thus, the poplar–poplar rust pathogen system is the only system in which the genome sequences of both tree host and rust pathogen are available. although poplar genomic analyses have revealed the genetic potential of susceptibility and transcriptomics has allowed for the deciphering of gene expression in space and time, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of resistance gene expression. recent evidence has suggested that post-transcriptional silencing involving small rnas of cellular rather than pathogenic origin might have broad implications in potentiating basal defense and race-specific resistance to microbes in plants  <cit> . the present study was conducted to decipher the regulatory functions of mirna in a susceptible poplar and to unravel the complexity of post-transcriptional regulation of resistance genes in the susceptible poplar ‘robusta’.

RESULTS
small rna sequencing profile
to study the post-transcriptional regulation associated with poplar susceptibility to rust, mirna accumulation was investigated by small rna sequencing. two small rna  libraries constructed from a combination of seven selected time points of the ‘robusta’ leaves of -rust  and + rust  were sequenced on an illumina gaiix system. to acquire more details of the srna background in one sequencing, seven time points covering the major developmental transitions of the urediniospores in poplar leaves were selected, consistently with previous studies  <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  raw sequences were generated from the -rust and + rust libraries, respectively. blast homology searches were performed against m. larici-populina , and the mapped reads were removed from the + rust library.

the length distribution of the mappable reads showed that 15-nt reads  were the most abundant sequences in the + rust srna library and that 21-nt reads  were the second most abundant sequences . in contrast, the -rust srna library showed that 21-nt reads were the most abundant sequences , constituting  <dig>  % of all reads. this latter result is in agreement with results from srna studies of p. balsamifera  <cit>  and vitis vinifera  <cit> , in which the 21-nt srnas showed the highest abundance. however, this result differs from the results of studies of other plants, in which 24-nt srnas were most abundant .

by removing the redundant sequences from mappable reads,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique sequences were identified from the -rust and + rust libraries, respectively. after removing the consensus sequences, a total of  <dig>  unique mirnas were identified in these two srna libraries. these unique mirnas were classified into two groups: known mirnas and predicted mirnas . known mirnas were further divided into two subgroups: gp1a and gp1b . predicted mirnas were further divided into six subgroups: gp2a, gp2b, gp3a, gp3b, gp4a and gp4b . by removing the no-hairpin subgroups and the subgroups that did not map to the poplar genome, gp1a, gp1b, gp2a and gp4a were identified as candidate mirna subgroups. among these candidate mirna subgroups,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were obtained from the -rust and + rust srna libraries, respectively. the potential novel mirnas identified by deep sequencing were deposited in the european nucleotide archive .

according to the eleven features of the mirna hairpins , the secondary structure of genes corresponding to the potential novel mirnas  were identified , and  <dig> predicted secondary structures of the potential novel mirnas are shown as examples .table  <dig> the potential novel mirnas and their targets

mirnas regulate gene expression in plants by promoting the degradation of or repressing the translation of target mrnas, both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally  <cit> . to associate rust fungi m. larici-populina infection with an alteration of poplar mirna accumulation, the differential expression of mirnas in the two libraries was compared using the log2-  fold changes of the normalized mirna copy numbers . log2-  fold changes > <dig> were designated as indicating ‘up-regulated mirna’ , and changes < − <dig> were designated as indicating ‘down-regulated mirna’ .fig.  <dig> identification of rust-responsive mirnas in p. nigra × p. deltoides ‘robusta’. a scatter plot of gene expression in + rust and –rust libraries according the log <dig> of normalized reads. expression levels are normalized by the mean numbers of transcripts per million clean reads . b scatter plot of mirna expression levels according to the raw reads. data points below  or above  the slope line represent down-regulated or up-regulated mirnas. c comparison of differentially expressed mirnas between the -rust and + rust libraries. the venn diagram displays the distribution of  <dig>  unique mirnas between -rust  and + rust  libraries. the log2-  fold changes > <dig> were designated as indicating ‘up-regulated mirnas’, and the changes < − <dig> were designated as indicating ‘down-regulated mirnas’



analysis of the differential expression of  <dig>  mirnas showed that  <dig>   were expressed in both the -rust and + rust libraries , whereas  <dig>   and  <dig>   were preferentially expressed in -rust and + rust libraries, respectively . analysis of co-expressed mirnas resulted in the identification of  <dig> mirnas  that showed significant differential expression between the -rust and + rust libraries. of these,  <dig>  were up-regulated, and  <dig>  were down-regulated after the inoculation of rust.

in the four candidate mirna subgroups,  <dig>  mirna members were responsive to rust infection . restricting the analysis to only those mirnas with more than  <dig> raw reads in both of the two srna libraries revealed changes of only  <dig> mirnas as shown in fig.  <dig>  in the subgroup gp1a,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated in response to rust infection . with the exception of  <dig> up-regulated mirnas, no differentially expressed mirnas were found in the gp1b subgroup . in the subgroup gp2a,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated in response to rust infection . in total,  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in response to rust infection in the gp4a subgroup and were potentially novel mirnas . the most robustly changed mirna was pc-5p-310376_ <dig> , with a peak log2-fold change of  <dig> .fig.  <dig> profiles of the differentially expressed mirnas. a the differentially expressed gp1a mirnas;b the differentially expressed gp1b mirnas; c the differentially expressed gp2a mirnas; d the differentially expressed gp4a mirnas. profiles of the differentially expressed gp1a, gp1b, gp2a and gp4a mirnas responsive to rust fungi m. larici-populina infection identified in srna libraries from infected  and uninfected  p. nigra × p. deltoides ‘robusta’ plants. only mirnas with more than  <dig> raw reads in both of the two libraries are shown. the positive and negative values indicate mirnas whose expression was up-regulated and down-regulated by rust, respectively. the asterisks denote the expression of the mirnas at different time points as tested by rt-qpcr



identification of mirna targets
to identify genes targeted by mirnas, a degradome cdna library from + rust poplar leaves was constructed. in total,  <dig> , <dig> raw, short sequencing reads were obtained from this library , and  <dig> , <dig> unique reads mapped to the populus mrna database . a list of all of the confidently detected mrna targets along with the corresponding alignments for the mirna–mrna interactions were generated by the pipeline. all five categories   <cit>  of the sliced-target transcripts were found. according to the  <dig>  mirnas identified in the + rust srna library,  <dig>  mirnas potentially targeted to  <dig>  poplar genes, and a total of  <dig>  regulating interactions were found.

these targets included  <dig> plant defense genes that were regulated by  <dig> mirna , such as the disease resistance protein tir-nbs-lrr, regulated by mir482a ; the hxxxd-type acyl-transferase family protein gene, regulated by mir <dig> ; and the wound-responsive family protein, regulated by mir394-p <dig>  additionally, these targets included  <dig> transcription factors that were regulated by  <dig> mirnas , such as the ap2/erf superfamily transcription factor gene, regulated by mir172g-3p ; the gras family transcription factor gene, regulated by mir171i-p <dig> ; the myb transcription factor gene, regulated by mir828a ; and the wrky <dig> gene, regulated by mir172b-5p .table  <dig> popular defense related genes responsive to rust infection and their regulating mirna

digital gene expression
to characterize the target gene expression pattern, two digital gene expression  libraries of -rust and + rust were constructed and sequenced. there were  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads sequenced from the -rust and + rust libraries, respectively. more than 99 % of the raw reads passed the filter cut-off, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads. in total,  <dig>  unique genes were obtained, and  <dig>  of those unique genes were mappable. of the unique reads,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  sense reads were mapped to one gene for the -rust and + rust libraries, respectively. the remaining  <dig>  % of the unique reads for the –rust library and the remaining  <dig>  % for the + rust library matched to multiple genes. the remaining reads were unique antisense or both sense and antisense reads that were mappable to genes.

to compare the differential expression patterns between the -rust and + rust libraries, we normalized  the read distribution for the gene expression level in each library to construct an effective library size and determined the significance of differentially expressed transcripts with x <dig> . according to the annotation of these genes, the rust infection-regulated gene expression was analyzed .fig.  <dig> scatter plot of rust infection-regulated gene expression. a scatter plot of mrna expression levels according the raw reads. data points above  or below  the slope line represent down-regulated or up-regulated mirnas. differentially expressed genes are denoted with circles based on x

according to the results of the dge analysis, the targets of the potential novel mirnas with altered expression were analyzed . then, the log2-fold changes of plant defense-related genes and their regulating mirnas were analyzed .

on the basis of differential expression analysis  <cit>  and control of the false discovery rate   <cit> ,  <dig> differentially expressed target genes were identified. to compare these results with the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  results, the log2-  fold changes > <dig> were designated as indicating ‘up-regulated genes’, and the changes < − <dig> were designated as indicating ‘down-regulated genes’.

gene ontology  analysis was performed for all of the differentially expressed genes . altogether,  <dig> differentially expressed target genes were linked to  <dig> go terms. once the go terms of interest were identified for the unigenes, the differentially expressed genes and their associated mirnas were analyzed . from the go terms, we found that many processes, such as response to stress , heat shock protein binding , unfolded protein binding , oxidation-reduction process, were prominently down-regulated and that the processes of response to oxidative stress , metabolic process , biosynthetic process , and cell wall macromolecule catabolic process  were up-regulated.

the impact of rust infection on post-transcriptional regulation in the susceptible poplar
from the analysis of the mirna, degradome cdna and dge libraries,  <dig>  regulatory interactions  were identified . among the  <dig> mirnas involved,  <dig> down-regulated  and  <dig> up-regulated  rust-responsive mirnas were associated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  regulatory interactions , respectively. among the  <dig>  regulatory interactions targeted by  <dig> down-regulated mirnas,  <dig>  target genes were up-regulated ,  <dig>  target genes were down-regulated ,  <dig>   target genes were unchanged , and the other target genes  were undetected by dge analysis. among the  <dig>  regulatory interactions targeted by  <dig> up-regulated mirnas,  <dig>  target genes were down-regulated,  <dig>  target genes were up-regulated,  <dig>   target genes were unchanged, and the other target genes  were undetected by dge analysis. the resistance-related mirnas and their target genes were found in poplar ‘robusta’, but not all of those mirnas and their target genes were in compliance with this negative regulation .fig.  <dig> post-transcriptional analyses of mirnas and genes in response to infection by rust in ‘robusta’. a post-transcriptional analyses of mirnas and genes in response to infection by rust in the susceptible poplar. b post-transcriptional analyses of mirnas and resistance genes in response to infection by rust in the susceptible poplar. a1: cc-nbs-lrr; a2: tir-nbs-lrr; b1: map kinase; b2: mapk/erk kinase; b3: kunitz family trypsin and protease inhibitor protein; b4: 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin; b5: glutaredoxin family protein; c1: wrky dna-binding protein; c2: wrky family transcription factor; c3: basic-leucine zipper  transcription factor family protein; c4: ethylene responsive element binding factor; c5: myb family transcription factor; c6: myb-like hth transcriptional regulator family protein; c7: jasmonate-zim-domain protein; d1: copper/zinc superoxide dismutase; d2: manganese superoxide dismutase; d3: ascorbate peroxidase; d4: monodehydroascorbate reductase; d5: glutathione peroxidase; d6: glutathione reductase; d7: glutathione s-transferase; d8: ferritin; e1: f-box and associated interaction domains-containing protein; e2: f-box family protein; e3: f-box/rni-like superfamily protein; e4: pathogenesis related homeodomain protein; e5: pathogenesis-related protein; e6: pathogenesis-related thaumatin superfamily protein; e7: peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain-containing protein; e8: phospholipase; e9: wound-responsive family protein; e10: wound-responsive protein-related

 <dig> test



furthermore, we analyzed the post-transcriptional regulation of  <dig> mirnas to  <dig> resistance genes, such as the genes encoding intracellular nucleotide-binding-site  -leucine-rich repeat  proteins , signaling cascades , transcription factors , reactive oxygen  and pathogenesis-related  . out of these  <dig> mirnas,  <dig>  regulated only one target gene, whereas the other  <dig>  regulated more than one target gene. in contrast,  <dig>  resistance genes were regulated by one mirna, whereas the remaining genes  were regulated by more than one mirna.

altogether,  <dig> resistance regulating interactions were identified, and these regulating interactions were further divided into five regulation modes. the first mode included  <dig> regulating interactions . the expression of target genes was unchanged  or up-regulated  in the first mode, although the accumulation of mirna was increased. only  <dig> regulating interactions  were identified in the second mode. in this mode, the accumulation of mirna was unchanged, but the expression of target genes was up-regulated  or strongly suppressed . the maximum amount of regulating interactions, a total of  <dig> interactions , was identified in the third mode. in this mode, the accumulation of mirna was decreased, but the expression of target genes was down-regulated  or unchanged . the fourth mode included  <dig> regulating interactions , and both the mirna and the target gene were unresponsive to the rust infection. the last mode, which is consistent with the classical post-transcriptional regulation theory, included  <dig> regulating interactions . in the last mode, the accumulation of mirna and the expression of target genes were in compliance with negative correlation .

validation and temporal pattern of mirna expression and target genes
to avoid missing significant differential changes in the mixed samples sequencing, rt-qpcr was performed for  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas  and target genes at 2 h post inoculation  of rust,  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi, 1 day post inoculation ,  <dig> dpi,  <dig> dpi and  <dig> dpi. these mirnas were selected based on principles additional file 1: text s <dig> and are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the expression patterns of the rt-qpcr results showed details that had not been found in the srna libraries and dge sequencing.

according to previous studies, before  <dig> dpi, infection hyphae extend into the mesophyll and differentiate into the first haustorial structures  <cit> . then, biotrophic growth continues, and the fungal biomass greatly increases between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  <cit> . during this time period, the expression of mirna volatility continually changes over time, and we found  <dig> expression patterns related to the development of rust occurring on poplar leaves . the expression of targets  did not accompany changes in mirna for all  <dig> time periods , but several negative interactions were found for the α-pattern mirna  and the γ-pattern mirna  at  <dig> dpi; in these cases, the targets were up-regulated, whereas the mirnas were down-regulated .fig.  <dig> mirna and target gene expression levels and symptoms at different time points post-inoculation. a test of mirna and target gene expression levels at different time points by rt-qpcr. b symptoms at different time points post-inoculation. mir172g-3p: target to ap2/erf superfamily transcription factor; mir171i-p3: target to gras family transcription factor gene; mir393_r + 2: target to f-box/rni-like superfamily gene; mir828a: target to myb transcription factor gene; mir172b-5p: target to ptrwrky <dig> gene; mir482a: target to tir-nbs-lrr gene; mir5032-p3: target to groes-like zinc-binding dehydrogenase family protein gene; mir6485-p3: target to o-methyltransferases gene; mir171e-p5: target to epsin n-terminal homology  domain-containing protein gene; mir6468: target to hxxxd-type acyl-transferase family gene. error bars indicate se . left-hand y-axes indicate the log2-fold change of mirna; right-hand y-axes indicate the log2-fold change of the target gene



framework of the susceptible poplar defense signal pathway
the mirna and target global maps indicated that most of the related kegg  pathways  were down-regulated or up-regulated after rust infection, whereas few target genes were responsive to rust infection in the susceptible poplar. the other pathways, such as plant hormone signal transduction, cell cycle and plant-pathogen interaction, showed the same pattern; i.e., the mirnas reacted strongly to the infection, but the target genes reacted mildly. the pathway of plant-pathogen interaction indicated that the mirnas related to fungal pathogen-associated molecular patterns , hypersensitive response  and fungal effectors were responsive to rust infection. however, only  <dig> of  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the same pathway.

according to the regulatory interactions, an mirna-mediated susceptible poplar defense signal pathway related to rust infection was revealed . the receptor-like kinase genes rlk  <dig>  rlk  <dig>  rlk  <dig>  rlk  <dig> and rlk  <dig> were up-regulated, whereas the regulating mirnas were down-regulated by rust infection. rlk  <dig> was up-regulated, but the regulating mirnas remained unchanged. rlk  <dig> was up-regulated, as were the regulating mirnas up-regulated.

the nbs-lrr family of resistance  proteins induced effector-triggered susceptibility . the results of degradome cdna library sequencing indicated that  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr family genes were regulated by  <dig> mirnas. although  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated significantly, none of the corresponding  <dig> target genes were up-regulated. two mirnas were up-regulated, whereas the target tir-nbs-lrr family genes were unchanged. only  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr gene family was up-regulated after the infection of rust fungi, whereas the regulating mirna was unchanged. additionally,  <dig> unchanging cc-nbs-lrr family genes were regulated by  <dig> down-regulated mirnas. the suppression of the tir-nbs-lrr-regulating mirna indicated that recognition occurred between the rust effectors and the poplar r proteins but that the signal promoting the expression of r proteins was blocked. this process explains why ‘robusta’ cannot prevent rust infection at the ets stage.

many downstream defense signal pathways were also found. first, pathogenesis-related  genes, which were triggered by effector signals and transcription factors, were investigated . mir5517-p <dig> was up-regulated, and its target pr gene was suppressed. two pairs of pr genes and their regulating mirna were unchanged. mir3447-p <dig> was strongly up-regulated, yet its target pr gene was unchanged.

second, the pathway related to salicylic acid , which is the main signal molecule for systemic acquired resistance  and hr, did not respond to rust infection, although many of the regulating mirnas were found to be down-regulated or up-regulated after infection. the enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig> gene  and the phytoalexin-deficient  <dig> gene , which act to induce genes upstream of sa accumulation, did not respond to rust infection. ankyrin-repeat protein npr <dig>  which acts downstream of sa and promotes the expression of the sar-associated genes pr- <dig>  bgl <dig>  and pr- <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , also did not respond to rust infection. the expression of the ‘robusta’ enhanced disease susceptibility  <dig>  gene was up-regulated slightly , whereas sa induction–deficient  <dig>  was unchanged  after rust infection, although eds <dig> and sid <dig> function upstream of sa accumulation in arabidopsis  <cit> . the programmed cell death-related gene also did not respond to rust infection. these results suggest that the signal transduction pathways are blocked, which typically leads to an hr-related accumulation of sa and programmed cell death to halt pathogen invasion. third, with the exception of the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  down-regulated and the promotion of 12-oxpophytodienoic acid reductase  <dig>  up-regulated, no genes related to jasmonic acid  or ethylene  responded to rust infection, including coronatine-insensitive protein  <dig> , jasmonic acid-amido synthetase  <dig>  and ethylene-insensitive protein  <dig> . normally, ja- and et-dependent resistance is up-regulated by lesion formation in a. thaliana. mpk <dig>  coi <dig> and jar <dig> are required to transduce the ja signal, whereas ein <dig> is required to transduce the et signal  <cit> .

discussion
the mirna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of plant resistance to biotic stress has been described in several plant pathosystems . in contrast, the molecular mechanisms of plant susceptibility to biotic stress and the post-transcriptional regulation of such susceptibility are poorly studied. identifying the genetic basis of host susceptibility/resistance is a prerequisite for understanding the interaction between pathogen and plant host. based on mirna, degradome cdna and dge library analyses, we investigated the regulatory functions of mirna in a susceptible poplar under rust attack. we found that the genes involved in the mirna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of the defense signal pathway were inactivated after infection by e <dig> in ‘robusta’, whereas this regulation was functional during e <dig> infection. this inactivation was the major characteristic of ‘robusta’ susceptibility.

the small rna sequencing revealed a significant peak in abundance of 15-nt reads, with  <dig> unique 15-nt mirnas were found in the + rust srna library. moreover,  <dig> mirnas targeted  <dig> unigenes, which included many disease-related genes, such as the ap2/b <dig> transcription factor protein family, the disease resistance cc-nbs-lrr class protein family, the disease resistance tir-nbs-lrr class protein family, cellulose synthase  <dig> genes, lrr and nb-arc domain-containing disease-resistance protein genes and stress-inducible protein genes. however, unexpectedly, none of these disease-related target genes responded to rust infection. these results indicate that the 15-nt mirnas responded to rust infection and showed a significant increase but that they failed to regulate their target genes in the susceptible poplar.

basal defense and r gene-mediated resistance are the two branches of the defense response carried out by plants under pathogen stress  <cit> . basal defense marks the first line of defense and consists of a set of defined receptors referred to as pattern recognition receptors , which recognize conserved, slowly evolving mamps or pamps  <cit> . the receptor-like kinases, which are part of the initial stages of pamps and pti, were up-regulated in this compatible  pathosystem, and the mirnas related to these stages were responsive to rust infection. these results indicate that the poplar defense commences with pathogen-associated molecular patterns  and pamp-triggered immunity  and that the mirnas are still functional at this stage.

the second branch of the defense response acts largely inside the cell and uses the polymorphic nb-lrr protein products encoded mostly by r genes  <cit> . although the basal defense of the poplar was almost completely destroyed in this compatible pathosystem, r gene-mediated resistance was not fully functional. moreover, the post-transcriptional regulation of the r gene did not occur. only  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr gene family, regulated by mir472b, was up-regulated after rust fungi infection, although poplar genomes contain  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr and  <dig> cc-nbs-lrr immune receptors encoded by r genes that recognize the pathogen infection and trigger resistance responses  <cit> .

twelve mirnas that guide the cleavage of  <dig> cc-nbs-lrr and  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr transcripts were identified . two tir-nbs-lrr and  <dig> cc-nbs-lrr genes were regulated by mirnas that belong to the mir <dig> superfamily; this result is consistent with those from previous studies  <cit> . both mir482b and its target cc-nbs-lrr were unresponsive to rust infection. in contrast, although mir <dig> was up-regulated ,  <dig> tir-nbs-lrr target genes were unchanged . as one of the most important plant immune system branches  <cit> , nbs-lrr-mediated disease resistance is effective against obligate biotrophic pathogens and hemi-biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . our results showed that the susceptible poplar nbs-lrr-related genes were not up-regulated by the rust biotrophic pathogen. interestingly, another study showed that nbs-lrrs are not substantially induced by an incompatible rust strain in p. trichocarpa × p. deltoides  <cit> . these findings suggest that the lack of substantial induction of nbs-lrrs by infection is not a characteristic specific to susceptible poplar but is common to both susceptible and resistant poplars.

all of the signaling component genes, including the genes related to et, sa, ja and hr, were unresponsive to rust infection, which suggests that the regulation of mirna-based hr signaling was blocked. normally, plants produce phytohormones to cope with infection by diverse pathogens  <cit> . sa is involved in resistance to biotrophic pathogens, whereas ja and et mediate resistance primarily to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . these results are consistent with our expectations and the gene-for-gene hypothesis, because the heterozygous resistant  poplar and the homozygous virulent  rust were used in this study. most of the studied plant pathosystems are related to the r-avr gene-mediated disease response during pathogen invasion  <cit> . however, in our study, the plant pathosystem of susceptible poplar vs. virulent rust  provides a new perspective for understanding plant resistance/susceptibility. however, our findings provide only initial insight into this topic, and a great effort will be required for a full understanding of the post-transcriptional regulation related to plant resistance/susceptibility.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the srna, degradome cdna and dge library analyses indicated that the defense-related post-transcriptional regulation of the susceptible poplar ‘robusta’ only function normally during the initial stages of pamps and pti. more importantly, the mirna-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of defense signal pathway genes were inactivated after infection by virulent rust at the stage of effector-triggered susceptibility and at the subsequent stages of salicylic acid and hr response. this inactivation is the major characteristic of ‘robusta’ susceptibility.
