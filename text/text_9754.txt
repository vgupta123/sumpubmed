BACKGROUND
moraxella catarrhalis is a gram-negative bacterium primarily associated with otitis media in children and respiratory infections in adults with compromised lung function, particularly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . the organism is also readily isolated from the upper respiratory tract of healthy individuals and thus was considered a commensal bacterium until relatively recently. the rate of colonization by m. catarrhalis varies depending on many factors such as age, socioeconomic status, geography, and overall health condition. it has been reported that ~2/ <dig> of children are colonized in their first year of life and 3-5% of adults carry the organism asymptomatically. following initial colonization, there is a high rate of turnover, indicating continual clearance and re-colonization by new strains  <cit> .

moraxella catarrhalis possesses several virulence determinants that enable it to persist in the human respiratory tract. a number of molecules in the outer membrane have been shown to contribute to adherence, allowing m. catarrhalis to bind and colonize the host mucosa. these include los, uspa <dig>  uspa2h, mcap, ompcd, hag/mid, mhab <dig>  mhab <dig>  mcha <dig>  mcha <dig>  and the type iv pilus  <cit> . in order to persist following colonization, m. catarrhalis possesses several mechanisms to evade the host immune system including resistance to complement. the best studied of these being uspa <dig> and uspa2h, which bind the c4-binding protein, c <dig> and vitronectin  <cit> , as well as copb, ompcd, ompe, and los  <cit> .

moraxella catarrhalis is often refractory to antibiotic treatment. over 90% of isolates have been shown to possess a beta-lactamase, making them resistant to penicillin-based antibiotics  <cit> , which are typically prescribed first to treat otitis media. the genes specifying this resistance appear to be of gram-positive origin  <cit> , suggesting that m. catarrhalis can readily acquire genes conferring resistance to additional antibiotics via horizontal transfer. additionally, recent evidence has shown that m. catarrhalis persists as a biofilm in vivo, giving it further protection from antibiotic treatment and the host immune response  <cit> .

the bacterial twin-arginine translocation  system mediates secretion of folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. the tat apparatus typically consists of three integral membrane proteins, namely tata, tatb, and tatc. tata forms the pore through which tat substrates are secreted whereas tatb and tatc are important for binding and directing the substrates to the tata pore. tatc acts as the gatekeeper for the secretion apparatus and specifically recognizes tat substrates via a well-conserved signal sequence  <cit> . this signal sequence is similar to that of the general secretory system in that it possesses n- , h- , and c-  regions, but also contains a tat-recognition motif  exhibiting nearly invariable twin arginines  followed by two uncharged residues  <cit> . proteins secreted via the tat system are often, but not limited to, proteins that bind cofactors in the cytoplasm prior to transport, such as those involved in respiration and electron transport, and proteins that bind catalytic metal ions  <cit> . the tat system has also been shown to secrete several factors important for bacterial pathogenesis including iron acquisition, flagella synthesis, toxins, phospholipases, and beta-lactamases  <cit> . in this study, we identified genes encoding a tat system in m. catarrhalis and mutated these genes in order to elucidate the role of this translocase in the secretion of proteins that may be important for pathogenesis.

RESULTS
identification of tata, tatb and tatc genes in m. catarrhalis
analysis of the patented genomic sequence of m. catarrhalis strain atcc <dig> using ncbi’s tblastn service  identified an orf  that encodes a protein similar to the tatc gene product of pseudomonas stutzeri <cit>  . tatc is the most highly-conserved component of the tat system among organisms known  to utilize this particular secretion apparatus  <cit> . tatc is located in the cytoplasmic membrane, typically contains  <dig> membrane-spanning regions, and plays a key role in recognizing the twin-arginine motif in the signal sequence of molecules secreted by the tat system. the m. catarrhalis atcc <dig> tatc-like orf specifies a 27-kda protein of  <dig> amino acids, and analysis using the tmpred server  revealed that it contains  <dig> potential membrane-spanning domains .

sequence analysis upstream of the m. catarrhalis tatc ortholog identified gene products similar to other conserved components of the tat system, tata and tatb . the orf immediately upstream encodes a 178-residue protein with a molecular weight of 20-kda that resembles tatb of providencia stuartii  <cit>  . upstream of the m. catarrhalis tatb-like gene, we identified an orf specifying a 9-kda protein of  <dig> aa that is most similar to tata of xanthomonas oryzae  <cit>  . tata and tatb are cytoplasmic proteins anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via hydrophobic n-termini. tatb forms a complex with tatc often referred to as the twin-arginine motif recognition module, while tata oligomerizes and forms a channel that is used to secrete tat substrates  <cit> . both m. catarrhalis atcc <dig> tata  and tatb  orthologs are predicted to contain hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains in their n-termini using tmpred . together, these observations suggest that m. catarrhalis possesses a functional tat system.

to assess the presence and conservation of the tat genes in other m. catarrhalis isolates, we amplified and sequenced these genes from strains o35e, o12e, mcghs <dig>  v <dig>  and tta <dig>  the encoded gene products were then compared using clustalw . of note, the annotated genomic sequence of the m. catarrhalis isolate bbh <dig> has been published  <cit>  and the predicted aa sequence of the tata , tatb  and tatc  proteins were included in our comparative analyses. overall, the tata and tatc proteins are perfectly conserved. the tatb proteins divide the strains into two groups where o35e, mcghs <dig>  tta <dig>  atcc <dig>  and bbh <dig> are 100% identical to each other, while o12e and v <dig> both contain the same aa substitution at residue  <dig> . we also noted that in all isolates examined, the tata and tatb orfs overlap by one nucleotide. a similar one-nucleotide overlap is also observed for the tatb and tatc coding regions. this observation suggests that the m. catarrhalis tata, tatb, and tatc genes are transcriptionally and translationally linked.

the m. catarrhalis tata, tatb and tatc genes are necessary for optimal growth
to study the functional properties of the tat proteins in m. catarrhalis, we constructed a panel of isogenic mutant strains of isolate o35e in which the tata, tatb and tatc genes were disrupted with a kanamycin resistance  marker. each mutant was also complemented with a plasmid encoding a wild-type  copy of the mutated tat gene and/or with a plasmid specifying the entire tatabc locus. a growth defect was immediately noted in the tat mutants as ~40-hr of growth at 37°c was necessary for isolated colonies of appreciable size to develop on agar plates, compared to ~20-hr for the parent strain o35e. hence, we compared the growth of the tat mutants to that of the wt isolate o35e in liquid medium under aerobic conditions. this was accomplished by measuring the optical density  of cultures over a 7-hr period. in some of these experiments, we also plated aliquots of the cultures to enumerate colony forming units  as a measure of bacterial viability.

as shown in figure 2a, the tata, tatb and tatc mutants carrying the control plasmid pww <dig> had lower od readings than their progenitor strain o35e throughout the entire course of the experiments. significant differences in the number of cfu were also observed between mutants and wt strains . together, these results demonstrate that mutations in the tata, tatb and tatc genes substantially reduce the growth rate of m. catarrhalis cells. complementation of the tata  and tatb  mutants with plasmids encoding wt tata  or tatb  did not rescue the growth phenotype of these strains. however, the construct prb.tat, which specifies the entire tatabc locus, restored growth of the tata and tatb mutants to wt levels . these results support the hypothesis that the tata, tatb and tatc genes are transcriptionally and translationally linked due to the one nucleotide overlaps between the tata and tatb, as well as the tatb and tatc orfs. for the tatc mutant, o35e.tc, introduction of the plasmid prb.tatc, which encodes only the tatc gene, is sufficient to restore growth to wt levels . this finding is consistent with the above observations since tatc is located downstream of tata and tatb , thus it is unlikely that a mutation in tatc would affect the expression of either the tata or tatb gene product. a tatc mutation was also engineered in the m. catarrhalis isolate o12e. the resulting strain, o12e.tc, exhibited a growth defect comparable to that of the tatc mutant of strain o35e, and this growth defect was rescued by the plasmid prb.tatc . these results demonstrate that the importance of the tat system to m. catarrhalis growth is not a strain-specific occurrence. of note, all tat mutants carrying the control plasmid pww <dig> grew at rates comparable to the mutants containing no plasmid .

the tata, tatb and tatc genes are necessary for the secretion of β-lactamase by m. catarrhalis
tat-deficient mutants of e. coli  <cit>  and mycobacteria  <cit>  have been previously shown to be hypersensitive to antibiotics, including β-lactams. moreover, the β-lactamases of m. smegmatis  and m. tuberculosis  have been shown to possess a twin-arginine motif in their signal sequences and to be secreted by a tat system  <cit> . more than 90% of m. catarrhalis isolates are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . the genes responsible for this resistance, bro- <dig> and bro- <dig>  specify lipoproteins of 33-kda that are secreted into the periplasm of m. catarrhalis where they associate with the inner leaflet of the outer membrane  <cit> . analysis of the patented genomic sequence of m. catarrhalis strain atcc <dig> with ncbi’s tblastn identified the bro- <dig> gene product , which is predicted to encode a protein of  <dig> residues with a predicted mw of 35-kda. the first  <dig> residues of the predicted protein were found to specify characteristics of a signal sequence . analysis with the lipop server  indicated a signal sequence cleavage site between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  of bro- <dig> , which would provide a free cysteine residue for lipid modification of this lipidated β-lactamase  <cit> . of significance, the putative signal sequence of bro- <dig> contains the highly-conserved twin-arginine recognition motif rrxfl , thus suggesting that the gene product is secreted via a tat system. of note, analysis of m. catarrhalis bro- <dig> sequences available through the ncbi database indicates that the molecules also contain the twin-arginine recognition motif .

based on these findings, we compared the ability of our panel of wt and tat mutant strains to grow in the presence of the β-lactam antibiotic carbenicillin. this was accomplished by spotting equivalent numbers of bacteria onto agar plates supplemented with the antibiotic. for comparison, bacteria were also spotted onto agar plates without carbenicillin. these plates were incubated for 48-hr at 37°c to accommodate the slower growth rate of tat mutants. in contrast to wt m. catarrhalis o35e, which is resistant to carbenicillin, the tata , tatb , and tatc  mutants were sensitive to the antibiotic. the introduction of plasmids containing a wt copy of tata  and tatb  did not restore the ability of the tata and tatb mutants to grow in the presence of carbenicillin, respectively. resistance to the β-lactam was observed only when the tata and tatb mutants were complemented with the plasmid specifying the entire tatabc locus , which is consistent with the results of the growth experiments presented in figure  <dig>  introduction of the plasmid encoding only the wt copy of tatc  in the strain o35e.tc was sufficient to restore the growth of this tatc mutant on medium supplemented with carbenicillin . of note, the tatc mutant of strain o12e was tested in this manner and the results were consistent with those obtained with o35e.tc . in order to provide an appropriate control for these experiments, an isogenic mutant strain of m. catarrhalis o35e was constructed in which the bro- <dig> gene was disrupted with a kanr marker. the mutant, which was designated o35e.bro, grew at the same rate as the parent strain o35e in liquid medium . as expected, the bro- <dig> mutant did not grow on agar plates containing carbenicillin .

the effect of tat mutations on the β-lactamase activity of m. catarrhalis was quantitatively measured using the chromogenic β-lactamase substrate nitrocefin. these assays were performed using suspensions of freshly plate-grown bacteria placed into the wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate. a solution containing nitrocefin was added to these suspensions and the change of color from yellow to red  was monitored by measuring the absorbance of well contents at a wavelength of 486 nm. substantially less β-lactamase activity was observed for the tata, tatb and tatc mutants compared to the wt strain o35e . complementation of the tata and tatb mutants with plasmids containing only the wt copies of the inactivated genes did not restore β-lactamase activity, as expected based on the results of the experiments depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the plasmid prb.tat, which specifies the entire tatabc locus, restored the ability of the mutants o35e.ta  and o35e.tb  to hydrolyze nitrocefin. the plasmid prb.tatc was sufficient to rescue β-lactamase activity in the tatc mutant strain o35e.tc to near wt levels . the tatc mutant of strain o12e was tested in this manner and the results were consistent with those obtained with o35e.tc . the control strain, o35e.bro, was impaired in its ability to hydrolyze nitrocefin at levels comparable to those of the tata, tatb and tatc mutants . taken together, these results suggest that the m. catarrhalis tatabc locus is necessary for secretion of the β-lactamase bro- <dig> into the periplasm where the enzyme can protect the peptidoglycan cell wall from the antimicrobial activity of β-lactam antibiotics.

to conclusively demonstrate that m. catarrhalis bro- <dig> is secreted by the tat system, we cloned the bro- <dig> gene of strain o35e in the plasmid pww <dig>  and used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the twin-arginine  residues in bro-2’s predicted signal sequence  with twin lysine  residues . similar conservative substitutions have been engineered in tat substrates of other bacteria to demonstrate the importance of the rr motif in tat-dependent secretion  <cit> . these plasmids were introduced in the mutant o35e.bro and the recombinant strains were tested for their ability to hydrolyze nitrocefin. as shown in figure 7a, expression of the mutated bro- <dig> from plasmid pts.brokk did not restore the ability to hydrolyze nitrocefin. these results establish that the m. catarrhalis β-lactamase bro- <dig> is secreted into the periplasm by the tat system. interestingly, the mutation in the rr motif of bro- <dig> also interfered with secretion of the β-lactamase by recombinant haemophilus influenzae db <dig> bacteria .

identification of other m. catarrhalis gene products potentially secreted by the tat system
to identify other m. catarrhalis molecules that may be secreted via the tat apparatus, the annotated genomic sequences of strains atcc <dig>  <cit>  and bbh <dig>  <cit>  were analyzed with prediction algorithms available through the tatfind  <dig>   <cit>  and tatp  <dig>   <cit>  servers. although these servers are designed for the same purpose , the algorithms used for each differ and as such proteins identified as tat substrates do not overlap 100% between the two prediction algorithms.

six orfs were predicted to be tat substrates in strain atcc <dig>  only one of which was identified by both algorithms . the tatp  <dig>  server identified mcorf  <dig> and mcorf  <dig> as proteins potentially secreted by the tat system, but no twin-arginine motif was found within the signal sequences of these gene products. conversely, the tatfind  <dig>  server identified mcorf  <dig> as a tat substrate and a twin-arginine motif was observed between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  although the encoded protein does not specify characteristics of a prokaryotic signal sequence , a potential lipoprotein signal sequence cleavage site was identified using the lipop server. interestingly, the mcorf  <dig> and mcorf  <dig> gene products resemble cytochrome c molecules involved in the electron transport chain. cytochromes have been predicted, as well as demonstrated, to be tat substrates in several bacterial species  <cit> . mcorf  <dig> exhibits similarities to iron-dependent peroxidases, which is consistent with the previously reported role of the tat system in the secretion of enzymes that bind metal ions, while mcorf  <dig> resembles the phosphate abc transporter inner membrane protein psta  <cit> . mcorf  <dig> shows similarities to a family of c-terminal processing peptidases and contains important functional domains including a post-translational processing, maturation and degradation region , and a periplasmic protease prc domain described as important for cell envelope biogenesis.

six putative tat substrates were identified in the genome of m. catarrhalis strain bbh <dig>  five of which overlapping those predicted in atcc <dig> . strain bbh <dig> specifies the unique tat substrate mcr_ <dig>  which is predicted to be a highly-conserved phosphatase . the mcorf  <dig> of strain atcc <dig> encodes a gene product that is  <dig> % identical to this putative phosphatase, but neither of the tatfind  <dig>  and tatp  <dig>  servers identified the orf as a tat substrate, likely due to significant amino acid divergence in the signal sequence . strain bbh <dig> specifies a putative c-terminal processing peptidase  that is  <dig> % identical to the putative tat substrate mcorf  <dig> of atcc <dig>  like the mcorf  <dig> of atcc <dig>  the bbh <dig> gene product lacked a tat motif in its signal sequence . despite these similarities, the bbh <dig> mcr_ <dig> c-terminal processing peptidase was not identified as a being potential tat substrate by the tatfind  <dig>  or tatp  <dig>  algorithms.

CONCLUSIONS
this report is the first characterization of a secretory apparatus for m. catarrhalis. our data demonstrate that the tat system mediates secretion of β-lactamase and is necessary for optimal growth of the bacterium. moraxella catarrhalis is a leading cause of otitis media worldwide along with streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable haemophilus influenzae , and is often found in mixed infections with these organisms  <cit> . in contrast to m. catarrhalis, most s. pneumoniae and nthi isolates are susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . in a set of elegant studies, schaar et al. demonstrated that outer membrane vesicles produced by m. catarrhalis contain β-lactamase and function as a long-distance delivery system to confer antimicrobial resistance for β-lactamase negative isolates of s. pneumoniae and nthi  <cit> . this constitutes a novel mechanism by which m. catarrhalis promotes survival and infection by other pathogens in the context of polymicrobial disease. hence, a greater understanding of the tat secretion system of m. catarrhalis is a key area of future study as it may lead to the development of innovative strategies to improve the efficacy of existing antimicrobials used to treat bacterial infections by common childhood pathogens. small molecular weight compounds that selectively inhibit tat secretion in m. catarrhalis could be used in concert with β-lactam antibiotics as β-lactamase inhibitors. this hypothesis is supported by the recent discovery that the compounds n-phenyl maleimide and bay 11– <dig> specifically interfere with tat-dependent secretion of the pseudomonas aeruginosa phospholipase c plch  <cit> .
