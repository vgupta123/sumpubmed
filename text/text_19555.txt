BACKGROUND
retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma  is a transcription factor belonging to a sub-family of nuclear receptors that includes two closely related members rorα and rorβ. even though a high degree of sequence similarity exists between the rors, their functional roles in regulation for physiological processes involved in development and immunity are distinct  <cit> . during development, rorγ regulates the transcriptional genes involved in the functioning of multiple pro-inflammatory lymphocyte lineages including t helper cells  which are necessary for il- <dig> production  <cit> . il- <dig> is a pro-inflammatory interleukin linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease; making its transcriptional regulation through rorγ an attractive therapeutic target .

rorγ consists of an n-terminal dna binding domain  connected to a c-terminal ligand binding domain  via a flexible hinge region. the dbd is composed of two zinc fingers that allow it to interact with specifically encoded regions on the dna called the nuclear receptor response elements. the lbd consists of a coactivator protein binding pocket and a hydrophobic ligand binding site  which are responsible for regulating transcription. the coactivator binding pocket of rorγ recognizes a conserved helix motif lxxll  on transcriptional coactivator complexes and recruits it to activate transcription  <cit> . like other nuclear hormone receptors, rorγ’s helix <dig> which makes up the c-termini of the lbd is an essential part of the coactivator binding pocket and is commonly referred to as the activation function helix  <dig>   <cit> . in rorγ, the conformation of the af <dig> helix required to form the coactivator binding pocket is mediated by a salt bridge between his <dig> and tyr <dig> in addition to π- π interactions between tyr <dig> and phe <dig>  <cit> . the conformation of the af <dig> helix can be modulated through targeted ligands which bind the lbs and increase the binding of the coactivator protein  or disrupt binding  thereby enhancing or inhibiting transcription  <cit> . since rorγ has been demonstrated to play an important role in pro-inflammatory gene expression patterns implicated in several major autoimmune diseases, our aim was to develop rorγ inverse agonists that would help down regulate pro-inflammatory gene transcription .

here we present the identification of two synthetic benzoxazinone rorγ ligands, a weak agonist bio <dig>  and an inverse agonist bio <dig>  which were identified using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer  based assay that monitored coactivator peptide recruitment. using partial proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry analysis we demonstrate that the af <dig> helix of rorγ destabilizes upon bio <dig>  binding. finally, comparing binding modes of our benzoxazinone rorγ crystal structures to other ror structures, we hypothesize a new mode of action for achieving inverse agonism and selectivity.fig.  <dig> fret results for agonist bio <dig>  and inverse agonist bio <dig> 



methods
cloning, protein expression and purification of rorγ518
gst-rorγ <dig> was constructed by sub-cloning residues  <dig> to  <dig> of a human rorγ cdna into a pgex-6p vector with a cleavable n-terminal gst fusion tag. bl <dig>  escherichia coli cells were transformed with the plasmid encoding the gst-prescission-hrorgamma 259– <dig> protein  and were grown at 37 °c in lb media supplemented with ampicillin to an od of  <dig>  the temperature was reduced to 18 °c and protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm iptg and was shaking for an additional 16 h. the cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer  and were lysed using a microfluidizer. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for 1 h at 4 °c and gst-rorγ <dig> was captured by batch binding to glutathione sepharose resin overnight at 4 °c. the resin was washed with buffer a  and loaded onto a xk column and washed until no non-specific unbound protein was detected. gst- rorγ <dig> was eluted from the column using buffer a supplemented with 10 mm glutathione ph  <dig>  and analyzed by sds-page. the eluate was then treated with prescission protease  and further purified on a superdex  <dig> column equilibrated in buffer b . rorγ <dig> eluted as a monomer and was approximately 95 % pure as observed by sds-page.

additional constructs including c-terminal truncations, surface entropy reduction and cysteine scrubbed mutations were also expressed and purified in the same manner as rorγ <dig> if an expression level of >1 mg/l was achieved.

rorγ fret based assay and gal <dig> reporter assay
fret-based  assay and the gal <dig> reporter assay were performed as described previously  <cit> . bio <dig> and bio <dig> were synthesized  and belonged to a proprietary library where they were identified as rorγ activity modulators using the fret-based assay.

partial proteolysis of rorγ518
rorγ <dig> at 8 mg/ml or in complex with 1 mm bio <dig> or 1 mm bio <dig> and  <dig>  mm coactivator peptide ebi <dig> efpyllsllgevspq  were treated with actinase e  added at a ratio of  <dig> ugs of protease/1 mg of rorγ <dig> for 6 h at 4 °c  <cit> . the reactions were quenched using 1x protease inhibitor cocktail  + 1 mm edta and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.

mass spectrometry of partially proteolyzed rorγ518
proteolyzed rorγ <dig> samples were reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol in 50 mm tris ph  <dig> , 150 mm nacl containing 4 m urea and 5 mm edta. the sample was then analyzed on a lc-ms system comprised of a uplc , a tuv dual-wavelength uv detector , and a zq mass spectrometer . a vydac c <dig> cartridge was used for desalting. molecular masses for the actinase e treated rorγ <dig> samples were obtained by deconvoluting the raw mass spectra using maxlynx  <dig>  software .

crystallization of rorγ <dig> with agonist bio <dig> and inverse agonist bio399
rorγ <dig> was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and ebi <dig> was added to a final concentration of  <dig>  mm and agonist bio <dig> to 1 mm and incubated on ice for 1 h. the coactivator peptide ebi <dig> which was identified by phage display was chosen for crystallization because of its strong interaction with rorγ in a mammalian two-hybrid analysis system that assessed the transactivation of rorγ  <cit> . diffraction quality crystals were grown through vapor diffusion in a buffer containing  <dig>  m hepes ph  <dig> , 25 % peg <dig> and  <dig>  m nacl at 18 °c. crystals were cryoprotected in the mother liquor containing 20 % glycerol as cryoprotectant prior to being frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection.

actinase e proteolyzed rorγ <dig> bio <dig> concentrated to 8 mg/ml was crystallized using vapor diffusion in a buffer containing  <dig>  m bistris ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m ammonium acetate and 15 % peg <dig> at 18 °c. crystals were cryoprotected for data collection by transferring them to a mother liquor containing 15 % peg <dig> prior to being frozen in liquid nitrogen.

data collection and structure determination for rorγ <dig> bio <dig> and bio <dig> complexes
x-ray diffraction data for all the crystals were measured at beam line id <dig> at the argonne photon source. the data were processed with mosflm  <cit>  in case of the rorγ518-bio592-ebi <dig> ternary complex and with hkl <dig>  <cit>  in the case of the actinase e treated aerorγ518/bio <dig> complex. for both datasets, pdb id: 3lol  <cit>  was used as the search model, and the molecular replacement solutions were determined using molrep  <cit> . the refinement was carried out using refmac <dig>  <cit>  and model building was carried out in coot  <cit> . the data processing and refinement statistics are provided in additional file  <dig> 

rorγ518-bio592-ebi <dig> ternary complex:

the data for the ternary complex were measured to  <dig>  Å. it crystallized in a p <dig> space group with four molecules of the ternary complex in the asymmetric unit. the final model was refined to a rcryst of  <dig>  % and rfree of  <dig>  %.

aerorγ518/bio <dig> complex:

diffraction data for the aerorγ518-bio <dig> complex were measured to  <dig>  Å. it crystallized in c <dig> space group with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. the final model was refined to a rcryst of  <dig>  % and rfree of  <dig>  %.

RESULTS
identification of bio <dig> and bio <dig> as ligands that modulate rorγ coactivator peptide recruitment
using a fret based assay we discovered agonist bio <dig>  which increased the coactivator peptide trap <dig> recruitment to rorγ  and a potent inverse agonist bio <dig>  which inhibited coactivator recruitment . interestingly, the structural difference between the agonist bio <dig> and inverse agonist bio <dig> was minor; with the  <dig> -dihydrobenzo <cit> oxazepin-4-one ring system of bio <dig> being  <dig> atoms larger than the benzo <cit> oxazine-3-one ring system of bio <dig>  in order to understand how small changes in the core ring system leads to inverse agonism, we wanted to structurally determine the binding mode of both bio <dig> and bio <dig> in the lbs of rorγ using x-ray crystallography.

structure of the rorγ518-bio592-ebi <dig> ternary complex is in a transcriptionally active conformation
rorγ <dig> bound to agonist bio <dig> was crystallized with a truncated form of the coactivator peptide ebi <dig> to a resolution of  <dig>  Å . the structure of the ternary complex had features similar to other ror agonist coactivator structures in a transcriptionally active canonical three layer helix fold with the af <dig> helix in the agonist conformation  <cit> . the agonist conformation is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between his <dig> and tyr <dig>  in addition to π-π interactions between his <dig>  tyr <dig> and phe <dig> . the hydrogen bond between his <dig> and tyr <dig> has been reported to be critical for rorγ agonist activity. disrupting this interaction through mutagenesis reduced transcriptional activity of rorγ  <cit> . this reduced transcriptional activity has been attributed to the inability of the af <dig> helix to complete the formation of the coactivator binding pocket necessary for coactivator proteins to bind.fig.  <dig> 
a the ternary structure of rorγ <dig> bio <dig> and ebi <dig>  b rorγ af <dig> helix in the agonist conformation. c ebi <dig> coactivator peptide bound in the coactivator pocket of rorγ



electron density for the coactivator peptide ebi <dig> was observed for residues efpyllsllg which formed a α-helix stabilized through hydrophobic interactions with the coactivator binding pocket on rorγ . this interaction is further stabilized through a conserved charged clamp wherein the backbone amide of tyr <dig> and carbonyl of leu <dig> of ebi <dig> form hydrogen bonds with glu <dig>  and lys <dig>  of rorγ. formation of this charged clamp is essential for rorγ’s function for playing a role in transcriptional activation and this has been corroborated through mutagenic studies in this region  <cit> .

bio <dig> binds in a collapsed conformation stabilizing the agonist conformation of rorγ
bio <dig> bound in a collapsed conformational state in the lbs of rorγ with the xylene ring positioned at the bottom of the pocket making hydrophobic interactions with val <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig> and phe <dig>  with the ethyl-benzoxazinone ring making several hydrophobic interactions with trp <dig>  leu <dig>  met <dig>  leu <dig>  ile  <dig> and his <dig> . the sulfonyl group faces the entrance of the pocket, while the cf <dig> makes a hydrophobic contact with ala <dig>  hydrophobic interaction between the ethyl group of the benzoxazinone and his <dig> reinforce the his <dig> sidechain position for making the hydrogen bond with tyr <dig> thereby stabilizing the agonist conformation .fig.  <dig>

rorγ af <dig> helix is sensitive to proteolysis in the presence of inverse agonist bio399
next, we attempted co-crystallization with the inverse agonist bio <dig>  however, extensive crystallization efforts with bio <dig> and rorγ <dig> or other af <dig> intact constructs did not produce crystals. we hypothesized that the rorγ <dig> coactivator peptide interaction in the fret assay was disrupted upon bio <dig> binding and that a conformational rearrangement of the af <dig> helix could have occurred, hindering crystallization.

the unfolding of the af <dig> helix has been observed for other nuclear hormone receptors when bound to an inverse agonist or antagonist . we used partial proteolysis in combination with mass spectrometry to determine if bio <dig> was causing the af <dig> helix to unfold  <cit> . results of the actinase e proteolysis experiments on rorγ <dig>  the ternary complex of rorγ <dig> with agonist bio <dig> and coactivator ebi <dig>  or in the presence of inverse agonist bio <dig> supported our hypothesis. analysis of the fragmentation pattern showed minimal proteolytic removal of the af <dig> helix by actinase e on rorγ <dig> alone  and the ternary complex remained primarily intact  . however, in the presence of inverse agonist bio <dig>  the proteolytic pattern showed significantly less protection, albeit the products were more heterogeneous , indicating the destabilization of the af <dig> helix compared to either the apo or ternary agonist complex .fig.  <dig> specific proteolytic positions on rorγ <dig> when treated with actinase e alone  or in the presence of bio <dig>  and shared proteolytic sites 



several rounds of cocrystallization attempts with rorγ <dig> or other rorγ af <dig> helix containing constructs complexed with bio <dig> had not produced crystals. we attributed the inability to form crystals to the unfolding of the af <dig> helix induced by bio <dig>  we reasoned that if we could remove the unfolded af <dig> helix using proteolysis we could produce a binary complex more amenable to crystallization.

af <dig> truncated rorγ bio <dig> complex is more amenable to crystallization
the actinase e treated rorγ <dig> bio <dig> ternary complex  co-crystallized readily in several peg based conditions. the structure of aerorγ493/ <dig> bio <dig> complex was solved to  <dig>  Å and adopted a similar core fold to the bio <dig> agonist crystal structure . the aerorγ493/ <dig> bio <dig> structure diverged at the c-terminal end of helix  <dig> from the rorγ <dig> bio <dig> ebi <dig> structure, where helix  <dig> unwinds into a random coil after residue l <dig> fig.  <dig>

inverse agonist bio <dig> uses met <dig> as a trigger for inverse agonism
bio <dig> binds to the ligand binding site of rorγ adopting a collapsed conformation as seen with bio <dig> where the two compounds superimpose with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å . the majority of the side chains within 4 Å of bio <dig> and bio <dig> adopt similar rotomer conformations with the exceptions of met <dig> and his <dig> . the difference density map showed clear positive density for met <dig> in an alternate rotomer conformation compared to the one observed in the molecular replacement model or the other agonist containing models . we tried to refine met <dig> in the same conformation as the molecular replacement model or the other agonist containing models, but the results clearly indicated that this was not possible, thus confirming the new rotamer conformation for the met <dig> sidechain in the inverse agonist bound structure. the change in rotomer conformation of met <dig> between the agonist and inverse agonist structures is attributed to the gem-dimethyl group on the larger  <dig> membered benzoxazinone ring system of bio <dig>  the comparison of the two structures shows that the agonist conformation observed in the bio <dig> structure would be perturbed by bio <dig> pushing met <dig> into phe <dig> of the af <dig> helix indicating that met <dig> is a trigger for inducing inverse agonism in rorγ .

bio <dig> and inverse agonist t <dig> bind in a collapsed conformation distinct from other rorγ inverse agonists cocrystal structures
the co-crystal structure of rorγ with t <dig> , an inverse agonist of rorγ ) shows that it adopts a collapsed conformation similar to the structure of bio <dig> described here  <cit> . the two compounds superimpose with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å . the cf <dig> group on the hexafluoropropanol group of t <dig> was reported to fit the electron density in two conformations one of which pushes met <dig> into the vicinity of phe <dig> in the rorγ bio <dig> agonist structure. we hypothesize that since the met <dig> sidechain conformation in the t <dig> rorγ structure is not in the bio <dig> conformation, this difference could account for the 10-fold reduction in the inverse agonism for t <dig> compared to bio <dig> in the fret assay.fig.  <dig>

co-crystal structures of rorγ have been generated with several potent inverse agonists adopting a linear conformation distinct from the collapsed conformations seen for bio <dig> and t <dig> . the inverse agonist activity for these compounds has been attributed to orientating trp <dig> to clash with tyr <dig> or a direct inverse agonist hydrogen bonding event with his <dig>  both of which would perturb the agonist conformation of rorγ. bio <dig> neither orients the sidechain of trp <dig> toward tyr <dig> nor forms a hydrogen bond with his <dig> suggesting its mode of action is distinct from linear inverse agonists . in the linear inverse agonist crystal structures the side chain of met <dig> resides in a similar position as the rotomer observed in rorγ agonist structures with bio <dig> described here or as observed in the hydroxycholesterol derivatives and therefore would not trigger inverse agonism with these ligands   <cit> .

bio <dig> shows selectivity for rorγ over rorα and rorβ in a gal <dig> cellular reporter assay
in order to assess the in vivo selectivity profile of bio <dig> a cellular reporter assay was implemented where the ligand binding domains of ror α, β and γ were fused to the dna binding domain of the transcriptional factor gal <dig>  the ror-gal <dig> fusion proteins were expressed in cells with the luciferase reporter gene under the control of a gal <dig> promoter  <cit> . bio <dig> inhibited the luciferase activity when added to the cells expressing the rorγ-gal <dig> fusion with an in vivo ic <dig> of  <dig> nm while showing > <dig> and  <dig> fold selectivity over cells expressing gal <dig> fused to the lbd of ror α or β, respectively . the lbs of rors share a high degree of similarity. however, the inverse agonism trigger of bio <dig>  residue met <dig>  is a leucine in both rorα and β. this selectivity profile for bio <dig> is attributed to the shorter leucine side chain in rorα and β which would not reach the phenylalanine on the af <dig> helix further underscoring the role of met <dig> as a trigger for rorγ specific inverse agonism . furthermore, rorα contains two phenylalanine residues in its lbs whereas rorβ and γ have a leucine in the same position . we hypothesize that the two phenylalanine residues in the lbs of rorα occlude the dihydrobenzoxazepinone ring system of bio <dig> from binding it and responsible for the increase in selectivity for rorα over β.table  <dig> gal <dig> cell assay selectivity profile for bio <dig> toward rorα and rorβ in gal4

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a novel series of synthetic benzoxazinone ligands which modulate the transcriptional activity of rorγ in a fret based assay. using partial proteolysis we show a conformational change which destabilizes the af <dig> helix of rorγ when the inverse agonist bio <dig> binds. the two rorγ co-crystal structures reported here show how a small change to the core ring system can modulate the mode of action from agonist  to inverse agonism . finally, we are reporting a newly identified trigger for achieving rorγ specific inverse agonism in an in vivo setting through met <dig> which perturbs the agonist conformation of the af <dig> helix and prevents coactivator protein binding.
