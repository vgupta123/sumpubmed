BACKGROUND
all organisms possess an evolutionarily conserved, rapid cellular defense mechanism commonly designated as the heat shock  response, which activates a variety of reactions in response to heat stress and a number of chemical stressors. it is characterized by rapid reprogramming of gene expression, leading to the production of a defined set of proteins called heat shock proteins , most of which act as molecular chaperones  <cit> . at the onset of stress, hsps prevent protein unfolding and aggregation, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis, which determines critical cellular structures and functions to regulate stress response.

hsps expression is regulated by multiple mechanisms. the central regulators of hsps expression are heat shock transcription factors. hsfs are the terminal components of a signal transduction chain mediating the activation of genes responsive to heat or other stress stimuli  <cit> . under normal growth conditions, hsf is maintained in an inert monomer state through association with molecular chaperones such as hsp <dig>  in response to heat shock, hsf is converted from a transcriptional inactive monomer to active trimmer using oligomerization domains, which function as sequence-specific trimeric dna binding proteins. hsfs are capable of recognizing the conserved binding motifs  within the promoters of hsf-responsive genes  <cit> . the consensus hses contain a cis-acting sequence, which consists of multiple inverted repeats of the 5'-ngaan-3' sequence   <cit> . at least three 5'-ngaan-3' repeats are required for a functional hse, and additional reiteration of the pentameric unit results in higher affinity interactions between hsf and hse  <cit> .

plant hsfs genes have been isolated from various species  <cit> . similar to many other transcription factors, the hsf family has a modular structure. despite considerable variability in size and sequence, hsfs are structurally and functionally conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. several highly conserved domains exist in the modular structure and all characterized hsfs have a common core structure comprised of dna binding and oligomerization domains  <cit> . in addition, another well-defined domain is a nuclear localization signal domain . apart from this, a c-terminal activation domain  and a nuclear export signal  are included in some hsfs  <cit> .

close to the n-terminal, the highly structured dna-binding domain  is the most conserved component of hsfs, consisting of an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet  packed against a bundle of three α-helices . the hydrophobic core of this domain forms a helix-turn-helix  structure required for specific recognition of the hse conserved motif  <cit> . an adjacent oligomerization domain  composed of hydrophobic heptad repeats is separated from the dbd domain by a flexible linker. through hydrophobic interactions, the heptad repeats form a helical coiled-coil structure reported responsible for the trimerization of hsfs  <cit> . plant hsf protein families fall into three classes  by peculiarities of their hr-a/b regions  <cit> . all class a and class c hsfs have an extended hr-a/b region due to an insertion of  <dig>  or seven  amino acid residues between the a and b of the hr-a/b region. in contrast, class b hsfs are discriminated from class a and c by the absence of this insertion and the presence of a single, continuous heptad repeat pattern. furthermore, the variable length of the linker between dbd domain and hr-a/b region also offer additional support for this classification   <cit> .

furthermore, at the c-terminus from the hr-a/b region a cluster of basic amino acids rich in arginine and lysine residues serve as a nuclear localization signal , which is required for nuclear import  <cit> . the nes is positioned at the c-terminus of some plant hsfs. the overall balance of nuclear import and export processes directed by the strength and accessibility of the nls and nes determines intracellular distribution of plant class a hsfs  <cit> . sequence comparison studies and functional analyses indicate that the combination of c-terminal activator motifs  adjacent to a nuclear export signal  represents the core of the c-terminal activation domain  for many plant class a hsfs  <cit> . aha motifs are rich in aromatic , hydrophobic  and acidic amino acid residues . on the other hand, class b and c hsfs have no activator function of their own resulting from the lack of aha motifs  <cit> .

the hsf gene family has been thoroughly characterized in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , whose genomes have been sequenced. furthermore, hsfs have been comprehensively studied in tomato  <cit> . previous study has reported several hsf genes cloned from maize  <cit> . the maize genome sequence project completed full maize genome assembly   <cit> . this provides an opportunity to deduce the maize hsf gene family and infer its evolutionary history and adaptations in heat and chemical stress response mechanisms at the molecular level. in the present study, we searched for all nonredundant sets of zmhsf genes and predicted their presumed structures. the results of this work provide a foundation to better understand functional and evolutionary history of the hsf gene family in angiosperms.

RESULTS
identification and physical locations of hsf proteins in maize
the amino acid sequence of hsf-type dbd domain  was adopted as a query in blastp searches for possible homologs encoded in the maize genome. as a result,  <dig> candidate hsf protein sequences were identified in maize. subsequently, all candidate hsf protein sequences were surveyed to further verify whether they contain hsf-type dbd domains using the pfam database. twenty-one candidate hsf protein sequences were discarded for incomplete the hsf-type dbd domain and overlapping genes. furthermore, two sequences were removed due to the absence of a coiled-coil structure by the smart program. consequently,  <dig> nonredundant maize hsfs were identified and described . all nonredundant maize hsfs were mapped on the  <dig> maize chromosomes . hsfs were distributed in every chromosome of the maize genome, however, the number of hsf genes on each chromosome varied widely. the largest number, comprised of six hsf genes, was detected on chromosome  <dig>  whereas the least number was found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  including only one hsf gene.

heat shock transcription factors identified from maize are listed with their names according to their chromosome location in figure  <dig>  proteins are designated according to their sequenced id, the protein sequence length, molecular weight , isoelectric point  and chromosomal locations.

conserved domains and motifs in maize hsf proteins
the modular structure of heat shock transcription factor was studied thoroughly in some model plants  <cit> . the detailed knowledge regarding tomato and arabidopsis hsfs functional domains enabled us to analyze similar domains for the  <dig> hsfs identified from the maize genome . five conserved domains were observed in the majority of the maize hsf proteins. the multiple alignment clearly showed the highly structured dbd domain of approximately  <dig> amino acids, located in the proteins amino-terminal section, which was the most conserved section of maize hsfs . marcoil was used to predict the coiled-coil structure characteristic of leu-zipper type protein interaction domains, which is a property of the hr-a/b region in the hsf protein sequences. the putative hr-a/b regions were consistently characterized by the predicted coiled-coil structure . information regarding the potential nls and nes domains in maize hsf protein sequences, which are crucial for dynamic intracellular distribution of hsfs between the nucleus and cytoplasm, were obtained by predictnls and netnes. nearly all hsfs contain two clusters of basic amino acid residues , which might serve as potential nls motifs. results obtained from mutation analysis of the two potential nls motifs from two related tomato hsfs  indicated that only one of the two motifs adjacent to the hr-a/b region, and not the conserved c-terminal part of the dbd domain is functional as an hsf protein nuclear localization signal  <cit> . prediction programs, sequence comparisons and cognitive models generated from previous research detected a wide range of putative nlss, which were monopartite or bipartite clusters and found close to the c-terminal of the hr-a/b region of maize hsfs. similarly, some putative ness were identified close to the c-terminal of maize hsfs. however, the following exceptions were observed: zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig> and zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig> and zmhsf- <dig> ness were closer to the hr-a/b regions than to nlss. in particular, zmhsf- <dig> nes was located in the hr-a/b domain region. as described by nover et al  and based on preceding investigations with the aha motifs of tomato hsf a <dig> and a <dig>  we used sequence comparisons and predicted the putative aha motifs in the center of the c-terminal activation domains for most class a maize hsfs . however, we were unable to predict class b and c putative aha motifs.

numbers in brackets indicate position of the putative nuclear localization signal , nuclear export signal , and activator  motifs in the c-terminal domain. putative nls can be monopartite  or bipartite .

meme web server was employed as a secondary method to analyze motif distribution and verify the results of domain prediction . specifying the dbd domain, motif  <dig> was found in  <dig> members of the maize hsf family. specifying the coiled-coil structure, motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were distinctively detected in all members of maize hsf family. all class b proteins exhibited the motif 6-type coiled-coil region, whereas motif 2-type coiled-coil region was only detected in classes a and c. the conserved motifs  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as nls, which were widely distributed in the maize hsf family. motif  <dig> was characteristic of class a and class c, and the nls domain was represented by motif  <dig> in class b. furthermore, motifs  <dig> and  <dig> represented nes and aha motifs, respectively, which were detected close to the hsfs c-terminal. lastly, some unknown motifs were also identified by meme motif analysis.

numbers correspond to the motifs described in figure  <dig> 

overall, despite variability in size and sequence, the predicted hsf dbd, hr-a/b region and nls domain were observed in each maize hsfs by two combined methods. although meme motifs did not correspond precisely to individual putative nes and aha domains defined by domain prediction of the first method, it was clearly indicated that a fraction of maize hsfs contained nes domains and the majority of class a maize hsfs had putative aha domains.

phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis in maize hsf proteins
in order to analyze the phylogenetic organization of the hsf families, a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> maize hsfs,  <dig> rice hsfs  and  <dig> arabidopsis hsfs  was performed by generating a phylogenetic tree . the oshsf and athsf protein sequences were downloaded from the rice genome annotation   <cit>  and the arabidopsis information resources   <cit> . all hsfs fell broadly into three major classes: classes a, b and c, with well-supported bootstrap values, which included representative genes of maize, rice and arabidopsis besides athsf- <dig> . in this study, class a was further subdivided into ten subclasses according to their bootstrap values and phylogenetic relationship, designated as a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  in our analysis, athsf- <dig>  did not cluster with subclass a <dig> but was grouped into subclass a <dig>  in addition, athsf- <dig>  and athsf- <dig>  were not classed in the hsf subclass a <dig> and class c respectively. moreover, zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig>  oshsf- <dig> and oshsf- <dig> constituted subclass a <dig> clade. the motif distribution analyzed by meme was also indicated in figure  <dig>  which was basically consistent with the phylogenetic analysis. the members of the same subclass usually share several class- and group-specific conserved motifs in addition to the hsf dbd, hr-a/b region, and nls domain. putative orthologous proteins were also identified in the tree, including, for example, zmhsf- <dig> and oshsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig> and oshsf- <dig> 

hsf gene duplications in the maize genome
the potential mechanisms involved in the evolution of the maize hsf gene family were elucidated by analyzing the duplication events that may have occurred during maize genome evolution. nine total duplicated gene pairs of the  <dig> maize heat shock factors were identified, including eight segmental duplication events between chromosomes  as well as one duplication event within the same chromosome  linked with lines . zmhsf- <dig> participated in two duplication events with zmhsf- <dig> and zmhsf- <dig> and each of these three genes belonged to class b. chromosome  <dig> was not involved in any duplication events.

digital expression analysis: est expression profile
maize hsfs expression patterns were studied using corresponding est database with known zmhsfs coding sequence, resulted in the assignment of zmhsfs to ten groups on the basis of tissue and organ types . in addition, other expression evidence was verified in magi and plantgdb databases . after integrating and analyzing all expression data, we found all zmhsfs were supported by expression evidence with the exception of the zmhsf- <dig> gene. interestingly, zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig>  and zmhsf- <dig> were found for expression in seeds, zmhsf- <dig> in shoot tips, and zmhsf- <dig> in roots. furthermore, zmhsf duplicated gene pair expression patterns were investigated, only two pairs  of nine shared the same expression patterns between the two members of each gene pair. in the other seven duplicated gene pairs, two paralogs of each gene pair exhibited dissimilar expression patterns. zmhsf- <dig> was detected in husks and seeds, however, its paralogue gene zmhsf- <dig> appeared to have no tissue-specific expression pattern.

+: expressed; blank: not expressed.

expression analysis of zmhsf gene family under heat stress treatment
to examine if these predicted genes were expressed in maize and to further confirm their stress-responsiveness to abiotic stress, quantitative real-time pcr was performed for  <dig> zmhsf genes in the leaves of maize exposed to heat stress. the analysis revealed that these genes are differentially expressed in the leaves under heat stress condition . twenty-two genes showed expression activity in maize leaves by heat stress. most of these responsive genes showed up-regulation of their expression, in which  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated . interestingly, six members including zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig> and zmhsf- <dig> showed no expression or only faint expression in the leaves of maize under normal growth conditions, however, they were strongly up-regulated during heat stress treatment. five genes  were greatly down-regulated  during the heat stress treatment. three genes  of  <dig> genes exhibited no expression in the leaves of normal and treated plants. moreover, our results showed that the transcript levels of five zmhsfs  did not present many changes in heat stress treatment. by comparing the expression data of each pair of duplicated zmhsf genes, nine pairs of duplicated genes exhibited significant divergence in their expression levels following heat stress treatment. for example, zmhsf- <dig> was dramatically down-regulated, while zmhsf- <dig> showed slight increase in transcripts at heat stress treatment.

discussion
in this study, a comprehensive set of  <dig> nonredundant heat shock factors were identified and characterized from the current version of the maize  genome. in a former publication,  <dig> maize hsf isoforms were reported, which were composed of  <dig> hsfs having intact orfs and six 5' truncated hsfs  <cit> . the following are likely responsible for these discrepancies. in the previous studies, the maize genome had not been completely sequenced,  <dig> maize hsf genes were identified by searching the publicly available maize est and genomic sequence survey  databases for homology to rice hsfs. in our study, the maize genome has been completely sequenced, therefore the maize genome database used here is more precise and complete than what was previously available.

although the maize genome is approximately 6-fold larger than rice , the gene number is similar  and their genetic map organization is highly conserved. we found maize and rice have the same number of hsfs  <cit> . this partially accounts for the support of hsfs conservation in these two species during the evolutionary process. in the investigation of conserved hsf domains, we observed two class a hsfs  lacking the aha motif, which is essential for class a hsfs transcription activity. previous study suggests  <cit>  these proteins bind to other class a hsfs forming hetero-oligomers to achieve their functions.

phylogenetic analysis of hsfs in maize, rice and arabidopsis indicated that zmhsfs are more closely allied with oshsfs than athsfs, consistent with the evolutionary relationships among maize, rice and arabidopsis i.e. two monocots in the poaceae subclass commelinidae and one dicot in the brassicaceae subclass dilleniidae. the fact that all three classes  identified in maize, rice and arabidopsis genes implies that the hsf genes originated prior to the divergence of monocots and dicots. hsfs of rice and maize appear more close relationship between each other in subclass a <dig> than to hsfs from arabidopsis. such observations suggest the expansion of these hsf genes following divergence of monocots and dicots.

the phylogenetic analysis showed that athsf- <dig>  and athsf- <dig>  were not grouped into subclass a <dig> and class c, respectively, and subclass a <dig> and class c were oshsfs and zmhsfs clusters. zmhsfs and oshsfs belong to the same clade, indicating that hsfs of these subclasses expanded in a species-specific manner from common ancestral genes that were present prior to diversification of the monocot and dicot lineages. phylogenetic data also proposed that subclass a <dig> and class c hsfs were expanded in monocots but not in arabidopsis. a single hsfa <dig>  is present in arabidopsis. however, maize has four members and rice contains five in subclass a <dig>  class c consists of three maize and four rice members, while arabidopsis has only one class c type member .

in addition, possible gene loss during the course of evolution was supported by phylogenetic reconstruction. subclasses a <dig> and a <dig> exhibit interesting characteristics that monocots were not found in these two subclasses. accordingly, this might indicates two dicot specific gene subclasses. gene duplication events play a significant role in the amplification of gene family members in the genome  <cit> . research has estimated the fraction of retained paralogs is 72% in maize, having occurred over the course of  <dig> million years of evolution  <cit> . the expansion mechanism of the maize hsf gene family was analyzed to understand gene duplication events. nine pairs of maize hsf gene paralogs were identified. among the paralogs, only one pair is involved in regional duplication in chromosome  <dig>  however, two members in each of the other eight pairs were arranged between chromosomes. this result suggested the maize hsf gene family expansion originated in a high number of large segmental duplications. an increase in the number of gene regulators  is an essential factor in the evolution of more complex systems in different species  <cit> . it is hard to achieve the expansions of these regulator gene classes only through single-gene duplications, which points to the importance of genome duplications in expanding the regulatory gene repertoire  <cit> . it was estimated that more than 90% increase in regulatory genes had been caused by genome duplications in the arabidopsis lineage in the last approximately  <dig> million years  <cit> . similarly, individual gene family expansion follows this rule. in plants, genome duplications have mainly contributed to expression of the aux/iaa family of auxin response regulators  <cit> . data from studies of the maize genome revealed that its genome has experienced two rounds of genome duplications, an ancient duplication prior to the maize-rice divergence and a recent event following triploidization  <cit> . the association of hsf gene expansion in maize with these two rounds of maize genome duplication explains this observation and in addition sheds light on the evolutionary process of the maize hsf gene family. furthermore, segmental duplications occur more often in more slowly evolving gene families, e.g. myb gene family  <cit> . due to the major role of segmental duplications in the hsf gene family evolution, the maize hsf gene family might hold a slow evolutionary rate.

several approaches were employed for maize hsf gene expression analysis by est database. zmhsf genes exhibited distinct expression patterns in different tissues or organs. one explanation is that zmhsf genes have different expression patterns in various tissues and at multiple developmental stages. expression profiles of  <dig> class a rice heat shock transcription factor genes have been resolved and the oshsfa genes displayed tissue-specific expression under normal conditions  <cit> . athsfa <dig> was exclusively expressed during the late seed development stage and controlled by the seed-specific transcription factor abscisic acid-insensitive  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, the expression data revealed that the majority of duplicated zmhsf gene pairs exhibited diverse expression patterns between two members. it suggested that functional diversification of the surviving duplicated genes is a major feature of the long-term evolution  <cit> .

expression analysis of quantitative rt-pcr showed that maize hsf genes exist different expression levels by heat stress. in this study, we have detected three hsfa2-type zmhsfs  with significantly higher expression, when subjected to heat stress. the result indicated that the zmhsfa <dig> subclass was closely related with maize heat shock response. moreover, six genes were remarkably up-regulated under heat stress condition, i.e. zmhsf- <dig>  zmhsf- <dig> and zmhsf- <dig>  and et al., which suggested specific roles for these genes in maize during heat stress. it is noteworthy that three zmhsfs  assigned to class b appeared to be strongly induced by heat stress. the hsfs belong to class b lack certain structural features of the class a activator hsfs. class b-hsfs may serve as transcriptional repressors or coactivator cooperating with class a hsfs. but the functional roles of these three class b-hsfs in maize will require further investigations. it is likely that the hsf genes remaining unaltered or down-regulated in expression may locate at downstream in the hierarchy of the events involved in heat shock response or are repressed by other members of the family  <cit> . in addition, if hsp proteins accumulate enough, they may be involved in feedback regulation to repress hsfs activity, such as hsp <dig> proteins. in the nine duplicated gene pairs of maize, the significant divergence of expression levels between the two members of each gene pair implied that duplicated genes had various functions in the response to heat stress in the evolutionary history.

CONCLUSIONS
this survey presents a comprehensive overview of the hsf gene family repertoire within the maize draft genome. based on structural characteristics and a comparison of the phylogenetic relationships among maize, rice, and arabidopsis, all  <dig> zmhsfs fell into three major classes , and class a was organized into  <dig> subclasses. further phylogenetic analysis revealed divergent expansion patterns of hsf gene families in classes and subclasses. our analyses suggest that whole genome and chromosomal segment duplications largely contributed to hsf gene family expansion in maize. our computational expression analyses suggest that many maize hsf genes play functional developmental roles in multiple tissues. furthermore, expression profiles by quantitative real-time pcr revealed that the majority of identified zmhsfs most likely are expressed in maize and these genes are induced by heat stress with differential induction levels in leaves. overall, our study will serve to better understand the complexity of the maize hsf gene family and guide future experimental work. together with the availability of the complete maize genome sequence and the increasing ease of obtaining mutants and raising transgenics, our analysis should facilitate functional characterization studies to confirm maize hsfs and deduce hsfs gene roles in plant stress responses.
