BACKGROUND
the different triggers eliciting rnai all ultimately lead to the formation of short  rna duplexes termed short interfering rnas . complete complementarity between the guide strand and the target mrna leads to catalytic cleavage of the mrna and suppresses gene expression  <cit> . endogenous micrornas  are also small duplex rnas with diverse and critical roles in gene regulation  <cit> . mirnas share many of the features of sirnas including the loading of the guide strand into a rna induced silencing complex   <cit> . in contrast to sirnas, mammalian mirnas do not generally exhibit high complementarity to their cognate target sites. binding of mirnas to their target sites may induce target degradation or may prevent translation and reduce gene expression at the protein level  <cit> . in mammals, mirnas are thought to bind to partially complementary sites predominantly located in the 3' untranslated regions  of target mrnas  <cit> , thereby enabling the coordinate regulation of genes containing such sites.

whilst the factors affecting sirna activity have been extensively studied  <cit> , the parameters affecting mirna-mediated translational suppression have not yet been definitively elucidated. binding of the 5' end of the guide strand to the target mrna appears to be critical, with an almost absolute requirement for complementarity at the so-called "seed site" from positions 2– <dig>   <cit> . mirna target sites appear to be almost exclusively located in the 3'utrs of target genes  <cit> , and mirna target sites may be functionally restricted to 3' utrs, since binding of mirnas to other sites in the transcript does not induce translational suppression.

the present study demonstrates proof of concept for the design of artificial short rnas with at least partial complementarity to multiple unrelated transcripts, and which suppress the expression of the corresponding unrelated genes. the interfering rnas described herein were designed to target expression of vegf-a and icam- <dig>  two genes involved in ocular neovascular disease  <cit> . we found that for suppression of vegf-a, the length of complementarity to the seed region, as well as the total complementarity of the guide strand to the target were important determinants of activity. this relationship was not observed for icam- <dig>  however this discrepancy appeared to result from specific sequence motifs in those guide strands with high icam- <dig> complementarity. thus, the length of seed complementarity, and overall complementarity between the guide strand and the target should be considered in the design of multi-target interfering rnas.

RESULTS
transcript sequences corresponding to the 3' utrs of vegf-a and icam- <dig>  were used to search for a suitable seed of at least  <dig> contiguous bases present in both genes. a pool of all possible seeds of  <dig> bases or greater was generated using the specified length as a window and advancing the window in a stepwise fashion  <dig> base at a time. low complexity seeds were eliminated and the pool was further restricted to those for which at least  <dig> contiguous bases were predicted to bind to an unpaired region in at least 50% of optimal and suboptimal  folded structures .

two different seeds were selected for experimental testing: one of  <dig> bases in length and one of  <dig> bases that was within a genetic context that favoured the design of "consensus target sequences" . multiple consensus target sequences were generated for both seeds by first aligning the target sequences  relative to their shared seed sequences. then, extensions 5' to the seed sequences were proposed to a length of  <dig> nucleotides. the exact complements of these  <dig> nucleotide consensus target sequences were assessed in silico for hybridisation to the target sequences, and one sequence for each seed was selected for experimental testing. "passenger" strands were designed to be complementary to the selected "guide" strands over a duplex length of  <dig> nt with 3' overhangs of  <dig> nucleotides .

annealed rna duplexes or single-stranded rna oligonucleotides were purchased from sigma-proligo. where required,  <dig> μm oligonucleotides were annealed in  <dig> μm tris,  <dig> mm nacl by heating to 90°c and cooling to 4°c over 3– <dig> hours. control sirna sequences are shown in additional file  <dig> 

because of the complexity of human disease, we sought to determine if it was possible to develop novel interfering rna that can multi-target one or more pre-selected therapeutic targets. we achieved this by identifying short regions of homology in pre-selected target rna with bioinformatic techniques. these "seeds" were then used to design short duplex rnas having one strand that binds with at least partial complementarity to each target rna sequence. examples of such computationally designed multi-targeting interfering rnas  were sought to simultaneously target two genes  that are associated with ocular neovascular disease  <cit> . two candidate seeds  that are present in the 3' utrs of both target mrna were identified and used to design "consensus target sequences" . the sequences complementary to these consensus target sequences  were evaluated for binding to the target mrnas using rnahybrid software  <cit> . two of these guide strands, one targeting each seed, were chosen for experimental testing; each having strong predicted binding to both target genes .

transfection of these codemirs into the retinal epithelial cell line arpe- <dig> induced significant suppression of both vegf-a and icam- <dig> , demonstrating the feasibility of designing synthetic rnas that suppress the expression of more than one gene at the protein level. the effects were qualitatively similar whether stimulation with deferoxamine or il-1β was used or cells were cultured without stimulation. however, stimulation afforded a much greater dynamic range for the measurement of both vegf-a and icam- <dig> enabling improved discrimination between codemir designs. thus, stimulation conditions were used in all experiments reported herein. codemir- <dig>  was further characterised. codemir- <dig> demonstrated dose-dependent suppression of vegf-a and icam- <dig> expression in arpe- <dig> cells . in contrast, the irrelevant cytokine il- <dig>  as measured by elisa of culture supernatant  was not affected by codemir- <dig> under similar conditions, demonstrating the specificity of the effect. in order to confirm that seed binding was required for the activity of codemir- <dig> against vegf-a and icam- <dig>  nucleotide substitutions introduced at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  or  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the guide strand of codemir- <dig> were tested in arpe cells . with the exception of codemir- <dig> , these had significantly impaired suppression of both vegf-a and icam- <dig> relative to codemir- <dig> at the protein level . moreover, expression of a cyan fluorescent reporter gene containing the codemir- <dig> target site in the 3'utr was suppressed by codemir- <dig> in a manner that correlated well with the observed suppression of endogenous vegf-a and icam- <dig> , demonstrating that the observed suppression of vegf-a and icam- <dig> was mediated by the binding of the guide strand of codemir- <dig> to its predicted target sites. the above results all relate to expression at the protein level, however, at the mrna level, codemir- <dig> also caused significant suppression of both vegf-a and icam- <dig>  and this suppression was reduced by mismatches in the seed region .

because the codemir- <dig> target site appeared particularly amenable to suppression, we focused on variants of this codemir. in a systematic approach,  <dig> variants of codemir- <dig> were designed by developing a consensus sequence for the vegf-a and icam- <dig> target sites and alternating between the vegf-a and icam- <dig> complementary base at mismatched positions  with the exception of mismatches that could be accommodated for by wobble base pairing with the eventual guide strand . all  <dig> of these codemirs were tested for the ability to suppress both endogenous vegf-a and icam- <dig>  and a cyan fluorescent protein reporter  in cell culture. suppression of the endogenous genes correlated well with suppression of the reporter , particularly for vegf-a where the range of suppression was greater. for vegf-a, there was a clear positive correlation between activity and the length of the contiguous complementary region  and a clear negative correlation between activity and the number of mismatches between the target and the codemir . by contrast, there was no such correlation between icam- <dig> suppression and the length of the contiguous stretch of complementarity and the correlation between activity and the number of mismatches between the target and the codemir was, in this case, reversed . indeed, the variant  which was completely complementary to the icam- <dig> mrna exhibited very poor activity against icam- <dig>  however, those codemirs with high complementarity to the icam- <dig> mrna all contained a region of at least  <dig> contiguous g nucleotides, a feature that is known to be detrimental to sirna activity  <cit> . substitution of the g at position  <dig> of the guide strand with an a in codemir- <dig> and codemir- <dig>  significantly improved the suppressive activity of these codemirs against both the endogenous and reporter genes ; confirming that runs of g nucleotides impair codemir activity.

as confirmation that the length of 5' complementarity between codemir- <dig> and the vegf-a mrna was critical to suppressive activity, we compared the activity of an interfering rna complementary to the codemir- <dig> vegf-a target site  with  <dig> variants containing introduced mismatches at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and/or  <dig> of the guide strand . mismatches at any of these positions reduced suppressive activity from >90% to 50–60%. this suggested that these central mismatches abrogated risc-mediated cleavage of the mrna, but that translational suppression, causing the retained moderate reduction in vegf-a protein levels, was less dependent upon complementarity at these central positions. this was confirmed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr detection of the vegf-a mrna  which demonstrated reduction of vegf-a transcript level with an sirna  directed to the codemir- <dig> site, but not with any of the central mismatch containing variants.

since the length of 5' complementarity appeared to be relevant to activity on vegf-a, we investigated codemirs which contained inosine bases  at crucial points . three variants of codemir- <dig> were designed which included inosine bases at positions  <dig> and/or  <dig> of the guide strand . these codemirs showed comparable icam- <dig> suppressive activity to codemir- <dig> , but reduced vegf-a suppression relative to codemir- <dig> in the case of codemir- <dig> and codemir- <dig> . the comparable activity against icam- <dig> may simply reflect the fact that translational repression against icam- <dig> is largely dependent upon the seed binding alone, and so is not affected by alterations in the 3' tail. the vegf-a suppressive activity of inosine-containing variants of codemir- <dig> was also compared to similar variants of codemir- <dig> with mismatches to the vegf-a mrna at positions  <dig> and/or  <dig> . none of the inosine-containing variants demonstrated substantially improved activity compared to the corresponding mismatched variant . this indicates that inosine base pairs, although tolerated in some positions, may not necessarily be useful in overcoming mismatches between guide strand and target, although our analysis may not be generalizable given that the binding of di to each base varies and is context-dependent.

there are  <dig> bases common to both icam- <dig> and vegf-a immediately downstream  of the codemir- <dig> target site. we investigated whether increasing the length of the complementary region  would increase activity. three variants of codemir- <dig> were designed such that the guide strand sequence was shifted 1– <dig> bases 5' of the codemir- <dig> sequence . however, none of these were as active as codemir- <dig> against either target . whilst the variants shifted  <dig> and  <dig> bases  would be predicted to have compromised strand loading due to the introduction of a g:c base pair close to the 5' end of the guide strand, the variant shifted  <dig> bases  would be predicted to retain a strong loading bias towards the guide strand.

mammalian mirnas have generally been shown to bind in the 3' utrs of target genes, and the codemirs described above all targeted 3' utrs. to assess whether the targeting of 3' utr regions is advantageous when there is incomplete complementarity between the target and the guide strand of a duplex rna in the central region  dsrna duplexes were designed such that they were completely complementary to the vegf-a mrna, excepting the nucleotides at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the guide strand . to minimize variations in efficacy due to sequence composition or strand-loading bias, each of these duplexes contained a similar bulge composition  and was relatively gc rich at the 3' end of the guide strand. of these  <dig>   <dig> targeted the vegf-a 5' utr,  <dig> targeted the vegf-a orf and  <dig> targeted the vegf-a 3'utr. in general, the duplexes targeting regions in the 5' utr or orf displayed poor vegf-a suppression, whereas those targeting regions in the 3' utr displayed strong suppression . moreover, there was a significant difference in activity between the duplexes targeting the orf and those targeting the 3'utr . this demonstrates that the 3' utr of vegf-a mrna is, relative to other regions of the mrna, more suited to suppression through mirna-like translational repression, which in part is likely to account for the high activity of codemir- <dig> and its variants against this target.

the use of rna duplexes is potentially confounded by off-target inflammatory cellular responses  <cit> . to confirm the specificity of action of codemir- <dig> we examined the expression of ifnβ and stat <dig>  after transfection with codemir- <dig>  no evidence of up-regulation of either of these genes was observed . in a recent separate study to be reported elsewhere, we studied the activation of tlr7/ <dig> by  <dig> sirna sequences when transfected with dotap into fresh human pbmcs at concentrations up to  <dig> nm. codemir- <dig> belonged to the least active subset of sequences , confirming low propensity of this sequence for activation of rna-sensing innate receptors.

discussion
the present study demonstrates proof of concept for the approach of using short interfering rnas with at least partial complementarity to two target transcripts for suppression of the expression of unrelated genes. although we have only presented data for two seed sequences in two genes here, we have successfully used the same approach to target unrelated genes implicated in diverse disease states including oncology, virology and inflammation  <cit> . thus, this approach can be used as a general technique for the suppression of multiple genes using a single interfering rna.

current pharmaceutical research is dominated by a reductionist "one-disease one-target" paradigm. however, the complex nature of many diseases has increasingly led to the realisation that activity against multiple targets may be required for effective treatment  <cit> . practically, this can be achieved through the use of multiple agents, and a number of combination drugs have recently become available for the treatment of heart disease and hiv infection, amongst other indications. however, the combination of multiple agents can lead to unforseen interactions  <cit> . alternatively, agents with activity against multiple targets can be developed  <cit> . indeed, many successful drugs in different areas of medicine  are active precisely because of their promiscuity of action  <cit> . to date, the rnai-based drugs that have been investigated have been designed for single specific targets, with efforts taken to reduce non-specific effects  <cit> . however, in some instances, the processes they target are distinctly polygenic , and the targeting of multiple genes seems likely to be therapeutically beneficial. whilst the targeting of multiple genes could be achieved through the use of a mixture of active sirnas, we believe that using a single active has a number of possible advantages. first, having a single active reduces the complexity of clinical and product development. secondly, mixtures of sirna can have disappointing effects because of competition for the risc machinery  <cit> . thirdly, a single active may have reduced off-target effects relative to a pool of actives, since each sirna has a unique pattern of off-target effects and a mixture may thus increase the magnitude and/or scope of off-target effects.

our finding that the length of seed complementarity affects codemir activity independent of overall complementarity is surprising given the current understanding of microrna-target interactions  <cit> . mismatches to the target in the central positions of the codemir- <dig> guide strand decreased vegf-a suppression at the protein level to 50–60%, and largely abrogated suppression at the rna level. this suggests that complementarity to the target at the 5'-end and in the centre of the guide strand is sufficient to induce target cleavage, and that codemirs with central mismatches to the targets may act primarily through translational repression. as such, codemirs with longer 5' regions of contiguous complementarity may exhibit higher efficacy. however, suppression of multiple genes related to the same phenotype is likely to have significant advantages over targeting a single gene, and thus codemirs with central mismatches will still be of significant utility.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study validates the approach of using a short dsrna molecule specifically designed with a single guide strand to suppress the expression of multiple unrelated genes implicated in a particular medical condition. we have shown that synthetic duplex rnas with at least partial complementarity to multiple transcripts are capable of specific suppression of multiple target genes. given the multi-genic nature of many disease states, such multi-targeting interfering rnas may offer significant therapeutic benefits relative to single target sirnas. our findings also have relevance to the biology of mirna-target interactions, particularly with respect to the effect of unpaired bases on mirna-mediated suppression of translation.
