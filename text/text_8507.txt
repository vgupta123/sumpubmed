BACKGROUND
spinal cord injury  is a common medical problem, which can trigger a cascade of events, including infiltration by macrophages, activation of resident glial cells, formation of cavities in the injury site, axonal demyelination, loss of both sensory and motor neuron function and neuronal damage and death  <cit> .

while numerous therapeutic interventions had been attempted in the past, a lack of suitable growth substrates, an insufficient activation of neuron-intrinsic regenerative programs, and extracellular inhibitors of regeneration limit the efficacy for anatomical and functional recovery after spinal cord injury  <cit> . the bulk of evidence has shown that the administration of some exogenous growth factors is potentially able to effect functional repair or nerveregeneration in injured spinal cords  <cit> .

a large number of different cytokines/growth factors are secreted into spinal wounds by blood cells, platelets and endogenous cells. one superfamily of cytokines includes transforming growth factor-βs   <cit> , of which three isoforms, tgf-β <dig>  -β <dig>  and -β <dig>  have been isolated in mammals  <cit> . it has been generally accepted that functions of tgf-β family members may vary depending on cellular status and cell types. tgf-β isoforms have been implicated in a broad diversity of biological activities, including cell growth, cell death, cell differentiation, inflammation, and immunological reactions, by modifying the expression of specific sets of target genes  <cit> . tgf-β has been shown to be both pro- and anti- apoptotic, influenced by both context and location. increases or decreases in the production of tgf-β have been linked to numerous disease states, including atherosclerosis and fibrotic disease of the kidney, optical nerve, liver and lung. tgf-β, especially tgf-β <dig>  is the predominant cytokine that plays an important role in the development of fibrosis  <cit> . reports demonstrated that the later induction of tgf-β <dig> at the point of sci may indicate a role in the maintenance of the scar  <cit> . it therefore suggested tgf-β <dig> is possibly involved in neuroplasticity following sci. however, newly developed tgf-β <dig> knock down transgenic mouse lines express tgf-β <dig> is still needed.

in the present study, we established transgenic  mice with tgf-β <dig> knock down by genetic manipulation. polymers chain reaction  was performed to identify the genotypes of mice. then, western blot and immunohistochemistry  were employed to detect the protein expressional levels and distributions of tgf-β <dig> in multiple tissues of different genotypes tg mice. these tissues were olfactory bulb, cortex, frontal lobe, basal forebrain, cerebellum, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, trachea, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, intestines, skeletal muscles and epidermis. the rates of tgf-β <dig> down-regulation in multiple tissues of different genotypes were evaluated by relative intensity to the level of wild type .

RESULTS
genotypes detection of tg
five heterozygosis transgenic offspring of tgf-β2-kd lines were obtained. four of them could generate offspring, which were designated as founder  <dig>  founder  <dig>  founder  <dig> and founder  <dig>  the tg mice with inserted fragment, identified by pcr, were regarded as positive tg .

protein expressional changes of tgf-β <dig> in multiple tissues of tg with different genotype
results of western blot, which detected in different multiple tissues of four genotypes tg , indicated that tgf-β <dig> expressions were down-regulated by different percentages in the four kinds of tg mice . the rates of protein down-regulation were calculated as following: rates of protein down-regulation = o.d. of wt- o.d. of founder/o.d. of wt *100%. .

distributions of tgf-β <dig> in multiple tissues
control of immunostaining specificity was performed by replacing the primary antibody with 2% goat serum. these controls did not exhibit any specific immune-staining in the olfactory bulb and brain .

olfactory bulb
immunoreactions  of tgf-β <dig> was seen in basal cells, supporting cells, neurons, apical cytoplasmic region of olfactory epithelium, lamina propria and gland's cell cytoplasm. positive-reactions were seen in a majority in the cytoplasm .

brain
the distributions of tgf-β <dig> immunopositive neurons and glia-liked cells were observed within the cortex, basal brain, frontal lobe, cerebellum, hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. they occurred in all layers of the cortical regions examined in this study, including the external and internal pyramidal layers. the somata and proximal dendrites with tgf-β <dig> ir were observed in the brain stem. a stronger labeling was present in granular cells and in axon-like fibers of the molecular cell layer. a few scattered immunopositive neuronal cell bodies and processes were present in the fastigial and dentate nucleus. immunoreaction products of tgf-β <dig> were mainly observed in the cytoplasm and perikarya of these neurons. nuclei of these cells were not stained .

spinal cord
tgf-β <dig> immunopositive profiles were present in rostral horn, ventral horn neurons as well as white matter of the spinal cord. the ir could be seen in the cytoplasm and processes, but not in the nucleus .

lung
tgf-β <dig> immunopositive profiles were found in the epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, as well as white blood cells. the ir was seen in the cytoplasm but not in the nuclei .

liver
tgf-β <dig> was distributed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes throughout the liver lobule. the ir of tgf-β <dig> was partially seen in liver acinus .

spleen
ir of tgf-β <dig> was detected in tunica media of artery, subendothelial smooth muscle cell and endotheliocyte. the immunoreactions then were seen in cytoplasm, but not in nucleus .

kidney
representative ir for tgf-β <dig> in renal section of tg mice showed diffuse positive staining within renal cortex, medullary interstitial, as well as the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule .

adrenal gland
the majority of tgf-β <dig> positive cells are located directly underneath the capsule, in the adrenal cortex .

intestine
tgf-β <dig> immunopositive files dispersed in lamina propria, epithelium mucosae and muscular layer. the immune-positive staining was primarily in the cytoplasm and partial cytolemma .

muscle
tgf-β <dig> staining was localized to the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle of mice. in the sarcoplasm there was staining in a transverse striation pattern at regular intervals the length of a sarcomere . immunostaining for tgf-β <dig> also showed positive staining in coronary arteries of hearts .

epidermis
the positive-reactions of tgf-β <dig> were detected in the epidermis of tg mice. the ir was found in cytoplasm and cytolemma of basal cells and follicular epithelium .

discussion
the present study generated different expression levels of tgf-β <dig> transgenic mice, which demonstrated that delivering shrnas targeting tgf-β <dig> gene could induce tgf-β <dig> protein expression decrease in transgenic mice, especially in the central nervous system. also, the expressed decrease in tgf-β <dig> protein was diverse in different phenotypic transgenic lines. the results detected by western blot analysis showed that the lowest value  of tgf-β <dig> protein was detected in founder  <dig>  while it was only 2% in founder  <dig>  in addition, we explored the systemic distribution of tgf-β <dig> in various tissues of tg mice, including the olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, cerebellum, cortex, hypothalamus, frontal lobe, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, intestines, skeletal muscles and epidermis. newly developed tg mice models of tgf-β <dig> down-regulation could be useful to further investigations.

our results of pcr for genotypes detection, which showed that the inserted fragments  were detected in four tg offspring of tgf-β2-kd lines, indicated that new tg mice model of tgf-β2-kd lines were obtained successfully by genetic manipulation. this study generated four kinds of available tg mice, which were designated founder  <dig>  founder  <dig>  founder  <dig> and founder  <dig>  these data strongly suggest that silence shrnas for tgf-β <dig> can be used for the creation of a continuous mammalian model in which selected target genes are stably suppressed and attenuated in vivo.

rna interference  is an extremely effective tool for studying gene function in almost all metazoan and eukaryotic model systems. rnai in mice, through the expression of short hairpin rnas , offers something not easily achieved with traditional genetic approaches-inducible and reversible gene silencing. previous research undertook targeted disruption of the tgf-β <dig> gene to determine its essential role in vivo. they demonstrated that tgf-β2-null mice exhibited perinatal mortality and a wide range of developmental defects for a single gene disruption. these include cardiac, lung, craniofacial, limb, spinal column, eye, inner ear and urogenital defects  <cit> . the present results show that shrnas-tgf-β <dig> can induce extensive tgf-β <dig> down-regulation in mice. a random integration of a transgenic fragment effectively reduced the systemic expressions of tgf-β <dig> in tg mice. however, the expression of decreased tgf-β <dig> protein was varied in different phenotypic lines, such that the highest rates of tgf-β <dig> down-expression  was detected in founder  <dig>  while that of founder  <dig> was only decreased by 2%. the diverse expression of tgf-β <dig> protein in four kinds of tg mice might have been due to the randomness of insertion sites of the recombination vectors in the target gene. furthermore, some unknown mechanisms of post-transcription regulation in different tissues might induce the different levels of tgf-β <dig> expressions in multiple tissues. epigenetic deregulation of the tgf-β <dig> gene pathway members is likely to be an early event in breast cancer formation, which was resulted from the epigenetic regulation  of tgf-β <dig> in a gene pathway  <cit> . in normal adult animals, tgf-βs  are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed in neurons and glia cells in both cns and pns  <cit> . the three tgf-beta isoforms described in mammals  have prominent functions related to morphogenetic events, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, and differentiation  <cit> . a number of studies have suggested that tgf-beta <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have differential temporal effects during the wound-healing process, and are important for optimal wound healing in the first week after wounding; beyond 1 week, tgf-beta <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> play a critical role in hypertrophic scar formation  <cit> . furthermore, knockout mice have revealed their importance in regulating inflammation and tissue repair  <cit> .

however, there is no report about newly developed tgf-β <dig> knock down transgenic mouse lines and the systemic distributions of tgf-β <dig> in tg mice. the surveys of tgf-β <dig> distributions in newly developed tgf-β <dig> knock down transgenic mouse lines provided some crucial information to investigate the role of tgf-β <dig> under physiological and pathological condition.

in summary, this study developed tg mice lines with tgf-β <dig> down-regulation and the systemic morphologic information that can be used in further research. our results showed that tgf-β <dig> proteins were widespread in multiple tissues, especially in nervous systems, intestines and epidermis. these results indicated that tgf-β <dig> might play multiple different biologic roles according to the different cell types. moreover, the present results generated four genotypes tgf-β <dig> tg mice of expressional down-regulated by different folds, which supplied multiple genotypes tg mice sources for different research.

CONCLUSIONS
our study established new transgenic mice lines with extensive down-regulation of tgf-β <dig>  we also supplied the down-regulated rates and systemic distributions of tgf-β <dig> protein in four phenotypic transgenic mice. the results showed that tgf-β <dig> knockdown mice like founder  <dig> could be designated as the target lines for further research.
