BACKGROUND
the thymus is a central lymphoid organ, in which bone marrow-derived t cell precursors undergo a complex process of maturation, eventually leading to the migration of positively selected thymocytes to the t-dependent areas of peripheral lymphoid organs. it has been largely demonstrated that, for such a process to occur normally, it is crucial that developing thymocytes interact to non-lymphoid cells of the organ, the thymic microenvironment  <cit> . this tridimensional network is composed of a variety of cell types; the thymic epithelial cells  being the most conspicuous elements, although nonepithelial dendritic cells, macrophages and, to a lesser extent fibroblasts, also play a role in the general process of intrathymic t cell differentiation. in this context, a group of interactions between developing thymocytes and microenvironmental cells is mediated by extracellular matrix  ligands and receptors  <cit> , and there is evidence that ecm molecules play a relevant role in localizing the different thymocyte stages of differentiation in discrete niches within the thymic lobules  <cit> . moreover, supramolecular ecm arrangements may function as a conveyor belt, allowing an ordered migration of thymocytes within the organ  <cit> . in this context, we have demonstrated that interactions mediated by fibronectin and its receptor vla- <dig>  influence tec thymocyte adhesion, as demonstrated by the use of neutralizing anti-cd49e monoclonal antibodies  <cit>  or rna interference to abrogate translation of the cd49e protein  <cit> . such functional relevance is not restricted to interactions mediated by fibronectin, but is rather extended to other ecm ligands. we demonstrated in both mice and humans that developing thymocytes and tec express constitutively the laminin receptor vla- <dig> , which also participates in heterocellular cell adhesion and migration events, which could be significantly disrupted by using anti-vla- <dig> antibody applied to growing tec prior to co-culturing with thymocytes  <cit> .

in addition to vla- <dig>  another integrin-type laminin receptor, vla- <dig> , was suggested to play a role in thymocyte adhesion to laminin  <cit> . moreover, we investigated the expression and in situ localization of laminin chains in the human thymic tissue, as well as in the lymphoepithelial complex named thymic nurse cells. also, we showed that tec produce laminin and grows faster in the presence of this molecule in culture dishes  <cit> .

more recently, we showed that tec control thymocyte migration in a multivectorial way, with each ligand/receptor pair contributing to one given vector  <cit> . furthermore, we found that one given interaction can modulate another interaction  <cit> , thus placing the multivectorial concept for intrathymic t cell migration still more complex.

in order to better understand the role of laminin receptors in the behavior of thymic epithelial cells we used herein rna interference to impair the expression of cd49f  in cultured human tec. this strategy resulted in the down modulation, not only of cd49f, but also other integrin α-chains of both laminin and fibronectin receptors. most importantly, we found that several other cell migration-related genes were modulated secondary to treating human tec with itga <dig> specific sirna, thus pointing to the notion that intra-tec expression of genes involved in controlling thymocyte migration by the thymic microenvironment should be regarded as complex networks. these gene modulations parallel the decrease in tec ability to adhere onto a laminin coat and to assume the normal stellate shape.

RESULTS
knock-down of itga <dig> in human thymic epithelial cells promotes adhesion defects
we successfully silenced itga <dig> gene in cultured human thymic epithelial cells by sirna, using specific anti-itga <dig> oligonucleotide. as compared to scramble oligonucleotide, itga <dig> rna message in tec transfected with itga <dig> sirna was reduced 70-80%, as seen by qpcr . such reduction could be clearly seen  <dig> hours after transfection. importantly, this effect was followed by a significant inhibition of the cd49f protein, as ascertained by cytofluorometry and immunofluorescence . worth of note, untreated tec compared with scramble sirna treated counterparts exhibited similar cd49f membrane expression levels .

next, we examined whether itga <dig> knocked-down tec showed any defects in their response to laminin. actually, α <dig> integrin-knocked down tec showed marked adhesive defects to laminin with impairment as compared to control sirna-treated cells. quantitation of this adhesion loss revealed a 60% decrease in cell adhesion to laminin, as compared to control. moreover, itga <dig> knocked-down telose their typical stellate profile in acquire the cell shape .

since many of the itga <dig> sirna-treated tec exhibited a smaller size, compared to controls, we could argue that significant amounts of these tec actually corresponded to dying cells. we approached this issue by flow cytometry, analyzing forward  and side scatter  profiles. this strategy allows us to indentify dying cells, by their very low fcs. nevertheless, in five independent experiments the cytofluorometric profiles in both groups were essentially the same in terms of the relative numbers of very low fsc pattern .

sirna-mediated itga <dig> gene silencing in human tec promotes a decrease in the expression levels of other integrin-type ecm receptors
we next investigated whether the surface expression of other integrin-type ecm receptor could be altered in itga6-sirna treated human tec. for that, we evaluated by flow cytometry of unfixed cells the membrane density of cd49b, cd49c and cd49d, the integrin α-chains for the receptors α2β <dig> , α3β <dig>  and α4β <dig> . in all cases, there was a significant decrease in the mean fluorescence intensity in itga <dig> sirna treated tec, when compared cultured tec incubated with the scramble sirna . differently, membrane density of cd <dig>  was similar in both groups , suggesting that not all β1-containing integrins expressed by human tec are down regulated concomitantly.

multiple cell migration-related genes are modulated in human tec after itga <dig> gene silencing
the above results prompted us to design experiments aiming to search for putative modulation of a large series of cell migration-related genes, comprising not only integrins but also laminins, as well as chemokines, known to be produced by tec and to play a role in interactions with developmental thymocytes  <cit> . overall, we evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr  <dig> genes  and compared their expression levels in itga <dig> sirna versus control sirna treated tec. figure  <dig> shows the heat map and dendrograms representing the bi-cluster analysis of these experiments . statistical comparison allowed us to define that the gene expression patterns differed between the two groups, with  <dig> genes  being either down- or up-regulated. among the clear-cut down-regulated cluster we found  <dig> genes, several of them encoding integrin and laminin chains.

particularly, the expression of itga <dig>  and itga <dig>  were significantly decreased. gene regulation induced by itga <dig> knock-down in the human thymic epithelium is far more complex, since  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated in itga <dig> sirna-treated tec as compared to controls, and also included genes encoding other integrin and laminin chains. interestingly enough, lama <dig> gene expression  is largely increased in itga <dig> knocked-down tec cultures suggesting a compensatory upregulation of this gene, whereas lamb and lamc genes are down-regulated. one could argue that these gene modulations were off-target effects. however, this does not seem to be the case, since when we applied a blast analysis with the six sirna sequences . we have not find a single target in the human transcriptome with e-value ≤  <dig> , thus strongly indicating the specificity of sirna to the itga <dig> mrna . lastly, the network complexity of gene expression under itga <dig> influence in human tec is much broader, since we found that other cell migration-related genes, namely those coding for a variety chemokines, were also modulated when igta <dig> was knocked-down. among them, six chemokines genes were down-regulated and three were up-regulated, whereas the expression of  <dig> genes did not differ significantly. furthermore, among six cytokine genes included in the analysis, one was down-regulated  and two were up-regulated .

potential networks of cell migration-related gene interactions that can be disrupted in human tec after itga <dig> gene silencing
considering that the experimental results described above point out to a complexity of gene regulation in itga sirna treated human tec, we evaluated in silico potential interaction networks that may be affected by itga <dig> knock-down. for that, we applied the bioinformatics tools available at genemania . we inserted separately itga <dig> with those ecm/integrin down- or up-regulated genes , and itga <dig> with modulated chemokine/cytokine genes . thus, in each panel, we can visualize again which genes were down- or up-regulated . in respect to the ecm/integrin networks , we included the following parameters: co-expression, physical interactions, co-localization, pathways, and genetic interactions. as depicted in the panel, in addition to the well-known physical interactions between integrin subunits and integrin and their corresponding ligands, there were a large number of pathway-related interactions in connection with the knocked-down itga <dig> gene. for chemokine/cytokine network , we included the co-expression and co-localization parameters. the putative interacting network seen in the panel suggests that effects of itga <dig> knock-down may have a direct effect upon cxcl <dig> and il- <dig>  with in turn would modify several other chemokines, through interactions due their co-expression and/or co-localization. overall, the in silico approach used herein indicates that, once itga <dig> gene is knocked-down, several intracellular circuits comprising the expression of membrane and secretory moieties related to cell adhesion and/or cell migration  by human tec may be altered, resulting in multiple changes in cell behavior.

discussion
the present work represents the first experimental knock-down of itga <dig> gene in the thymic epithelium, and provides new clues on the complexity of cell migration-related gene networks existing in this tissue.

we first demonstrated that treatment of cultured human tec with itga <dig> specific sirna  largely reduced the expression levels of both itga <dig> transcripts and the corresponding cd49f integrin subunit, as determined by qrt-pcr, cytofluorometry and immunofluorescence, respectively. this knock-down affected the functional capacity of tec to adhere to laminin, the specific ligand of integrin receptors containing α <dig> subunit, in addition to a loss of the typical stellate profile. by contrast, flow cytometry data strongly indicate that cell viability is not altered. interestingly, the itga <dig> gene knock-down was paralleled by a significant reduction of the membrane expression levels of other integrin α-chains, such as cd49b, cd49c and cd49d, which form the integrins α2β <dig> , α3β <dig>  and α4β <dig> , receptors for type  <dig> collagen, laminin and fibronectin, respectively. this is somewhat distinct from the effects we have recently reported in respect to the impairment of cd49e expression , in which we did not find changes in the membrane expression of vla- <dig>  ascertained by cytofluorometry as well  <cit> . conceptually, these findings support the notion that, although a cross-talk among integrins in the thymic epithelium does occur, it has specificities related to the given integrin whose expression is abrogated.

in any case, these data prompted us to perform a larger cell migration-related gene analyses, now comprising selected  <dig> genes of ecm ligands and receptors, as well as chemokines. rather surprisingly, qrt-pcr data revealed that the expression levels of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> were significantly changed;  <dig> being down-regulated and  <dig> being up-regulated. the expression levels of several transcripts encoding integrin and laminin chains were decreased in itga <dig> sirna treated tec. nevertheless, itga <dig> gene transcription was not significantly altered when comparing itga <dig> sirna versus control sirna treatment. this is apparently paradoxical with the decrease seen at the membrane expression levels of the corresponding cd49f. interestingly however, very similar data were recently reported in respect to human keratinocytes: itga <dig> knock-down in these cells also resulted in a decrease of cd49c on the cell membrane but no difference was seen at the transcriptional levels  <cit> , thus suggesting that cd49c expression is translationally regulated following itga <dig> gene knock-down.

it is also interesting to note that we found down- and up-regulation among those genes encoding laminin chains. this finding indicate that some homeostatic circuits may be triggered following itga <dig> gene knock-down, somehow re-shaping the pattern of laminin expression by human tec.

it is also noteworthy that fn <dig> gene transcription level by tec is also down-regulated after itga <dig> gene knock-down, showing that the expression of another ecm ligand/receptor pair  is affected when itga <dig> transcription is impaired.

lastly, quantitative gene expression analysis also revealed that various chemokine genes are modulated following itga <dig> knock-down, thus unraveling how complex is the control of cell migration-related gene expression in the human thymic epithelium. this scenario is further supported by the in silico approach for searching potential interactive networks among the various ecm/integrin and chemokine genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented herein clearly show that down regulation of itga <dig> gene in the human thymic epithelium triggers a complex cascade of effects upon the expression levels of several other cell migration-related genes, including extracellular matrix and chemokine ligands and receptors. in this respect, our findings point to the notion that the expression of several genes involved in the control of thymocyte migration by the thymic microenvironment should be regarded as complex networks, so that a defect in the expression of one single gene may result in an amplified cascade with significant down-regulation of tec adhesion onto the natural ligand, and potential consequences upon the normal patterns of tec/thymocyte interactions.
