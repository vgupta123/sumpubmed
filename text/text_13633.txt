BACKGROUND
the echinocandins  are lipopeptides that inhibit glucan synthase, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of β- <dig> -d-glucan, a major structural component of fungal cell walls. these drugs demonstrate fungicidal activity against most species of candida and are effective against azole-resistant yeasts and candida-forming biofilms . the infectious diseases society of america  <cit>  and the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases  <cit>  guidelines for the management of candida infection recommend echinocandins for first-line therapy  <cit> .

two reference methods analyze the susceptibility of yeasts to echinocandins: the broth microdilution  method designed by the clinical laboratory standards institute   <cit>  and the method proposed by the european committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing  . these methods have some aspects in common: the use of bmd, the use of rpmi  <dig> broth as a basal medium, a 24-h incubation period, and a prominent inhibition  minimum inhibitory concentration  endpoint criterion. the main differences are as follows: inoculum density ; glucose content of the medium ; microdilution wells ; and endpoint reading . moreover, eucast breakpoints for and and mcf are lower than the clsi breakpoints; additionally, eucast has not proposed clinical breakpoints for csp.

until now, in italy, there is not an extensive study concerning the in vitro susceptibility of echinocandins against candida isolates using the eucast method  <cit> . the aims of this study are: i) to determine the susceptibilities of candida spp. to and, csp, and mcf using both the eucast and clsi methods; and ii) to compare the performance of both methods by assessing the essential agreement  and categorical agreement  levels.

RESULTS
in each experiment, the mic values of the quality control strains fell within the established ranges published for both methods  <cit> . the modal mic  values by eucast/clsi for and, csp, and mcf for each control strain were, respectively, as follows: c. krusei atcc  <dig>   <dig> / <dig> ,  <dig> / <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> ; c. parapsilosis atcc  <dig>  1/ <dig>   <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig> . table  <dig> summarizes the in vitro susceptibility values of  <dig> clinical isolates of candida species to echinocandins as determined by the clsi and eucast bmd methods, as well as ea, and ca between two methods for each echinocandin and candida species. generally, the mic values for all three echinocandins were low and below the susceptibility breakpoint, regardless of the method used. as shown by other authors  <cit> , the mic values for and  and mcf  were lower those for csp  by both assay, suggesting that they have superior in vitro potency. when the species-specific clinical breakpoints were applied, the overall resistance rates for eucast/clsi were as follows: and,  <dig> / <dig>  %; csp, breakpoint not available/ <dig>  %; mcf,  <dig> / <dig>  %. these data are consistent with those reported previously  and document the excellent potency and spectrum of echinocandins against most candida spp. of the  <dig> csp resistant isolates by clsi, five were mcf resistant, three were and resistant, and one was resistant both and and mcf; this discrepant susceptibility pattern is according to other studies  <cit> . given the mechanism of action that is shared among the echinocandins, it is biologically unlikely that such large percentages of isolates are non susceptible to csp but remain susceptible to and and mcf. a potential explanation for this finding may be the technical issues associated with the in vitro testing of csp rather than a true difference in antifungal activity  <cit> . for this reason, neither eucast nor clsi procedures recommend the use of csp for antifungal susceptibility testing, while and and mcf as markers for csp susceptibility  <cit> .table  <dig> agreement between the results of the european committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and clinical laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods for anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin

the trend in the rate of resistance to echinocandins was analyzed: no significant trend was observed for each drug over the studied 14-year period, by both methods.

the mic values were the highest for c. parapsilosis complex and c. guilliermondii by the two methods. a natural polymorphism occurring in the hot spot, one region of fks <dig> has been suggested to be responsible for the reduced echinocandin susceptibilities of these species  <cit> . unlike yeasts with acquired fks mutations, these strains respond well to standard therapy presumably because the polymorphism only weakly affects the sensitivity of glucan synthase for drug  <cit> . moreover, the good clinical response of c. parapsilosis may be due to its less virulent, reduced capacity to invade the deep tissue, and the high probability of therapeutic success if central venous catheter is removed  <cit> .

in our study, the resistance to and , csp , and mcf  was most prominent among c. glabrata complex isolates. similarly, the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program reported echinocandin resistance of  <dig> – <dig>  % among  <dig> c. glabrata from blood stream infections  <cit> ; moreover, in a 10-year survey at the duke university hospital echinocandin resistance rate increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % in 2001– <dig>  <cit> . prolonged therapy with these drugs has been suggested to be a potential cause for decreased susceptibility to echinocandins among isolates of c. glabrata .

a decrease in the activity of and , mcf , and csp  was also observed among isolates of c. tropicalis.

for most isolates, the echinocandin mics obtained by the eucast method tended to be one twofold dilution lower than those obtained by the clsi method. the reason for this result could be related to known differences between the two methods: the higher carbohydrate content in the rpmi and higher inoculum could be responsible for the lowering of the eucast results  <cit> .

the overall ea was very high: 93 % for mcf, 92 % for and, and 90 % for csp. the spearman’s correlation analysis shows a significant positive correlation between eucast and clsi mics . this finding was consistent with the results of previous global multicenter studies by pfaller et al.  <cit>  and confirms the high level of ea between the reference procedures. the rates of ea were also high when results were analyzed per species, and the worst ea  was for c. glabrata complex tested against and. a good ca was also observed for all organism-drug combinations, ranging from  <dig> to 100 %. the lowest ca was for c. glabrata complex isolates to and, where five  isolates were resistant when applying eucast breakpoints as opposed to one  when applying the clsi breakpoints. the meaning of this in vitro finding is not clear and needs to be clarified in more detail. the best ca was for c. parapsilosis complex to and and mcf.

CONCLUSIONS
our study had some limitations. first, none of our strains were characterized with respect to echinocandin resistance mechanisms. second, the lack of eucast species-specific breakpoints for csp precludes a more standard comparison for the assessment of the ca. third, this study was an observational laboratory based survey, therefore no data was available as to the type and duration of antifungal therapy. nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic to be carried out in italy. our data show that the eucast and clsi echinocandin mic values for candida isolates from patients in italy are in accordance with the worldwide epidemiology of candida strains . likewise, the echinocandins were active in vitro against the majority of candida species tested in this study; a reduced susceptibility, as has been noted elsewhere  <cit> , was detected for c. glabrata complex and c. tropicalis. mic values obtained by the clsi and eucast methods are comparable for the testing of echinocandins against candida species. regression analysis confirms the close proximity of the mics generated by each method. in most cases, the mic differences between standard procedures are small enough that using one method or the other should not result in susceptibilities that are different enough to affect treatment decisions. the clinical implications regarding the improvement of the susceptibility tests to echinocandins are significant, since accurate data are important in defining differences in clinical efficacy among and, csp and mcf, thereby supporting the most appropriate choice of early antifungal treatment towards a better prognosis. further efforts are needed to harmonize the two standard procedures.
