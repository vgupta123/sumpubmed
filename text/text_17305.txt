BACKGROUND
viruses and bacteria have evolved survival strategies based on antagonism of host immunoregulatory molecules  <cit> . cytokine signaling pathways are prime targets, often subverted by horizontal acquisition of genes encoding cytokines or their receptors that are then selectively modified and marshaled  <cit> . with genomes orders of magnitude larger than viruses and bacteria, helminths have the capacity to maintain multiple and complex immune antagonizing strategies to facilitate their intricate life cycles within obligate mammalian hosts. indeed, recent work has shown that filarial nematodes express a homolog of transforming growth factor beta  that can bind to host receptors  <cit> . nevertheless, compared to bacteria and viruses, our knowledge of immune modulatory mechanisms employed by parasitic helminths is in its infancy.

interleukin- <dig>  is a  <dig> kda monomeric glycoprotein of the type i hematopoietin superfamily secreted by t helper  <dig>  cells, nk t cells, mast cells and basophils  <cit> . its pleiotropic functions are still being enumerated and include acting as a th <dig> cell developmental determinant, a t/b cell growth factor, an ige/igg <dig> class-switch inducer and a muscle cell contraction inducer. each of these functions of il <dig> plays a role in mobilizing and coordinating anti-helminth immune responses  <cit> . in vivo administration of antibodies or recombinant cytokines that raise il <dig> levels diminish helminth infection; conversely, lowering il <dig> levels increases helminth infection  <cit> . mice genetically deficient in il <dig> or the il <dig> receptor display impaired capacity to control experimental worm infection  <cit> . il <dig> transduces signals to the cell interior via two distinct heterodimeric receptors that share a 140-kda membrane-spanning il4rα subunit  <cit> . il4rα is paired in the type i receptor with the 42-kda common gamma subunit  and in the type ii receptor with the 65-kda interleukin- <dig> receptor alpha  <dig> subunit . the type ii receptor binds not only il <dig> but also the paralogous cytokine il <dig>  through alternative splicing, both il4rα and il13rα <dig> can be secreted as soluble molecules that can modulate immune responses by altering local concentrations of free il <dig> and il <dig>  <cit> . this complex receptor system mediates the pleiotropic functions of il <dig> through regulated and non-uniform expression on a wide variety of hematopoietic and other cell types.

as a key host molecule triggered by and required for the control of parasitic worms  <cit> , il <dig> may constitute a battleground upon which helminths are locked in evolutionary conflict with their mammalian hosts. testifying to the crucial adaptive nexus occupied by il <dig>  evolutionary diversifying selection has been detected acting on the human il <dig> promoter, leading to the fixation of promoter sequence variants that differentially bind the transcription factor nfat and consequently have distinct thresholds for transcriptional triggering  <cit> . high levels of il <dig> expressed by individuals inheriting the sensitive form of the promoter might provide a mechanism to overwhelm a parasite-derived il4-antagonist molecule.

previous studies have remarked on the rapid evolution of il <dig> and il4rα  <cit> . to explore whether pathogen antagonism could provide an explanation, we analyzed il <dig> sequences from multiple mammalian lineages and found a strong signature of diversifying selection, clustered at interfaces that interact not only with il4rα but also with il13α <dig>  this striking evolutionary signature is consistent with pathogen antagonism of il <dig> but formally is also consistent with rapid co-evolution between il <dig> and its receptor. we tested the latter possibility by exploiting the fact that in mice, natural intra-specific il <dig> variation clusters at the site  <dig> epitope for il4rα binding. in sensitive cellular and biochemical studies of two murine il <dig> allotypes, we found that site  <dig> epitope variation is functionally neutral with respect to il4rα binding affinity and kinetics as well as signalling il4-dependent cellular responses. given the functional neutrality of intra-specific variation at  <dig> residues evolving under diversifying selection, we speculate that the capacity to buffer amino acid variation at the il4rα site  <dig> epitope is an adaptation to recurrent pathogen antagonism, seen previously in other host-host interaction surfaces subject to pathogen mimicry  <cit> .

RESULTS
evolution of il <dig> in mammals
diversifying or positive selection is typically seen in molecular arms races, especially at direct interfaces between host and pathogen proteins  <cit> . we investigated whether sequence variation of il <dig> could have arisen by recurrent diversifying selection  during mammalian evolution. we used data from whole genome sequencing projects to compare the il <dig> coding sequence from  <dig> eutherian mammalian lineages. the 'model selection tool' at the online hyphy server  identified the hky <dig> model as the most appropriate using the aic criterion . a maximum-likelihood phylogeny  was constructed using the phyml method using the il <dig> coding nucleotide alignment; this phylogeny was largely congruent with accepted mammalian phylogeny  <cit> . an almost identical topology was obtained using distance based neighbor-joining methods, except for minor variation in the rodentia. figure  <dig> shows the amino acid alignment of representative il <dig> proteins from  <dig> mammals, including  <dig> primates. using the free-ratio model in the paml suite of programs  <cit> , which allows an independent assignment of dn/ds ratios to each evolutionary branch, we found that most branches of the phylogeny show dn/ds < <dig> with the overall dn/ds ratio for the entire tree equaling  <dig>  . the accelerated evolution of the rodent lineage  <cit>  is evident in the long branch leading to the four rodents but this is not due to an overall increase in dn/ds in rodents. indeed, the free-ratio model  was not a statistically superior fit to the one-ratio model 

when we compared the likelihood of il <dig> evolution under codon models that prohibit  or permit diversifying selection , we found that models permitting diversifying selection fit il <dig> evolution significantly better than those that disallow it . in the m7-m <dig> comparison, we found that 15% of residues have evolved with an average dn/ds ratio of  <dig>  indicating that il <dig> has evolved under recurrent diversifying selection in mammals  consistent with previous reports  <cit> . we found robust evidence of positive selection in an analysis limited to rabbits and rodents alone, limited to laurasiatheria alone, and to all eutherian mammals excluding either rodents and rabbits, or excluding primates. however, we do not find robust evidence for diversifying selection when the analysis is limited to  <dig> primates including  <dig> prosimians . this suggests that the selective pressure that recurrently drove positive selection of eutherian il <dig> may be relaxed in the primate lineage. a recent primate evolution study of genes involved in hiv pathogenesis also found evidence for il <dig> having experienced diversifying selection  <cit> . the discrepancy with our il <dig> analysis  may be due to different species analyzed in each study. it must also be noted that the signature for selection in the previous study was modest  <cit>  with only  <dig> site identified as having evolved under positive selection.

all analyses were done using the fcodon model. results are qualitatively identical using the f <dig> ×  <dig> model of codon substitution.

*multiple topologies for rodent phylogenies were tested due to poor phylogenetic resolution in this lineage - the conclusion of positive selection is not dependent on the use of a particular topology; the values reported are those found when used with a phylogeny consistent with the consensus view of rodent evolution.

our analysis identifies  <dig> codon positions in which there is significant evidence of diversifying selection   of which three sites meet the more stringent criteria of posterior probability > <dig>  . these sites are also identified with high confidence under a bayes empirical bayes model  <cit> . despite the long history of il <dig> evolution sampled here, several positions are either invariant or very similar in eutherian mammals .

il <dig> folds into a 4-helix bundle structure similar to that of gmcsf, il <dig> and il <dig>  <cit> . the structural epitope for il4rα binding  is large , comprising a mosaic of  <dig> residues contributed by alpha helices a, b and c and mediates high affinity binding   <cit> . directly adjacent to site  <dig> is a  <dig> Å site  <dig> epitope for γc binding comprising  <dig> residues contributed by alpha helices a and d  <cit> . the il13rα <dig> subunit found in the type ii il <dig> receptor expressed on non-hematopoietic cells binds to a distinct  <dig> Å site  <dig> epitope comprising  <dig> residues contributed by loops connecting helices a-b and c-d on the il <dig> face opposite site  <dig>  <cit> . both the γc and il13rα <dig> subunits exhibit low affinity for the binary il4/il4rα complex  and even lower  affinity for soluble il <dig>  accordingly, a two-step model has been proposed for il <dig> binding to its type i and ii receptors  <cit> . in an initial 3d reaction, il4rα binds with high affinity to soluble il <dig> via the site  <dig> epitope. in a second 2d reaction restricted to the plane of the cell membrane, the binary il4/il4rα complex binds γc in the type i receptor or il13rα <dig> in the type ii receptor via site  <dig> or site  <dig>  respectively  <cit> .

strikingly, positively selected residues cluster in two groups  that overlap site  <dig>  and site  <dig>  epitopes. that clustering occurs at the il <dig> ligand:receptor interface could suggest that sequence variation was driven by selective pressure to modulate signaling intensity. alternatively, sequence variation may be driven by pathogen antagonism to directly interfere with il4: il4rα interactions; in the latter case, sequence variation would be expected to be functionally neutral for ligand:receptor interactions so as to avoid disadvantageous perturbations to normal il <dig> signaling. to distinguish between these possibilities, we decided to test the functional consequences of sequence variation for il4: il4rα interactions, focusing on recently diverged murine homologs of il <dig> that had alterations specifically at their receptor interacting residues.

clustered intra-specific variation at the il <dig> site  <dig> epitope is functionally neutral for il4rα binding and signalling
we compared the murine sub-species m. musculus  and m. castaneus  and discovered  <dig> amino acid sequence changes between them . to infer the spatial distribution of the  <dig> polymorphic residues we aligned human and mouse il <dig> sequences and mapped orthologous residues onto the human il <dig> protein structure  . strikingly, the  <dig> polymorphic residues  mapped either in or adjacent to the il4rα-binding site  <dig> epitope.

to test whether naturally arising variation in site  <dig> residues is functionally relevant with respect to il4rα interactions, we expressed and purified recombinant balb/c and cast/ei il <dig> for biophysical and functional studies. to determine the affinity of il4rα for balb/c and cast/ei il <dig>  we measured surface plasmon resonance  using a biacore apparatus. purified m. musculus il4rα extracellular domain  <cit>  was immobilized on an spr chip and graded doses of recombinant il <dig> were passed in the mobile phase over the chip. surprisingly, balb/c and cast/ei il <dig> bound il4rα with similar affinity  and kinetic on and off rates , in good agreement with previously published measurements  <cit> .

next, we sought to determine whether, despite sharing similar binding affinity for il4rα, balb/c and cast/ei il <dig> might differ in their ability to signal il4-dependent biological responses. mouse b and t cells fail to express il13α <dig> and therefore express only the type i il <dig> receptor  <cit> , ensuring their readouts will be sensitive to il4rα interactions. first, we compared the capacity of balb/c and cast/ei il <dig> to signal b cells to upregulate cell surface expression of cd <dig>  a well-established il4-dependent response  <cit> . over a  <dig> fold dynamic range we detected no difference in the ability of balb/c and cast/ei il <dig> to signal cd <dig> upregulation, regardless whether the responding cells were of balb/c or cast/ei origin . as il <dig> is also a b and t cell growth factor  <cit> , we tested its relative capacity to induce cellular proliferation. as with upregulation of cell surface molecules, balb/c and cast/ei il <dig> elicited identical proliferative responses from both b and t cells , again regardless whether the responding cells were of balb/c or cast/ei origin. taken together, these results indicate that naturally arising genetic variation in il <dig> residues mapping to the site  <dig> epitope is functionally neutral with regard to il4rα binding and biological signalling.

our finding that intra-specific changes in il <dig> were functionally neutral for il <dig> receptor binding suggests a high degree of redundancy and therefore relaxed constraint at the ligand:receptor interface. this is at apparent odds with our evidence for diversifying selection acting at  <dig> of  <dig> site  <dig> epitope residues polymorphic between m. musculus and m. castaneus . similar failures to detect functional ramifications of variation at sites identified as subject to recurrent diversifying selection were reported recently in studies of environmental adaptation -- detection of light wavelengths by rhodopsin  <cit>  and odors by an odorant receptor  <cit> . however, selective episodes driving environmental adaptation are expected to be of low frequency and intensity, leaving variants associated with very subtle functional ramifications. by contrast, selective episodes driven by classical red-queen host:pathogen conflicts are expected to be of high frequency and intensity, leaving variants associated with robust functional ramifications  <cit> . importantly, this rapid evolution would be expected at host:pathogen not host:host interfaces, entirely consistent with our functional data. given that paml methods  <cit>  and especially clustering of residues subject to diversifying selection have proven diagnostic not only of antagonism but also of host specificity determinants  <cit> , and given the important role played by il <dig> in host protection from helminths, it is likely that the evolutionary signatures we have discovered point to a previously hidden mode of pathogen antagonism, although the identity of this antagonist currently remains unknown.

discussion
our analyses are consistent with previous studies that used human population genetics and snp association to suggest that il <dig> and il4rα have experienced recent episodes of diversifying selection  <cit> . additional support comes from a recent phylogenetic sequence analysis comparing human, primate and mouse that detected signatures of diversifying selection  for il <dig> and other γc-dependent cytokines . based upon the failure to detect a similar signature of diversifying selection in γc itself, the authors proposed that cytokine selection was driven by mutual competition for γc, a common receptor subunit for each cytokine  <cit> . consistent with o'connell et al  <cit> , we did not detect positively selected codon positions in the il <dig> γc-binding site  <dig> epitope. however, the prediction that flows from the o'connell hypothesis -- that il <dig> variants differing in positively selected residues would bind with differential affinity to il4rα -- is not borne out by our functional data.

the earliest support for il <dig> having evolved under diversifying selection comes from pair-wise analyses of mouse and rat il <dig> and il4rα that detected elevated r/s ratios in the receptor-binding region of il <dig> and the extracellular  domain of il4rα  <cit> . the authors of those studies concluded diversifying selection of il <dig> was driven by co-evolution of the receptor/ligand pair  <cit> . but, co-evolutionary forces tend to impede rather than facilitate evolutionary changes at protein-protein interaction surfaces.

we propose instead that genetic conflict  is most consistent with such evolutionary signatures. we have found that il <dig> has evolved under strong and recurrent diversifying selection focused at  <dig> positions . twelve of these fall in or near the site  <dig> epitope comprising the il4rα binding interface. two more positively selected residues form a second cluster falling in or near the site  <dig> il13rα1-binding epitope used by the type ii il <dig> receptor. from an evolutionary perspective the interaction interface of il <dig> with its receptor is an ideal antagonist target as it is likely to be functionally constrained, necessitating escape from antagonism to require coordinated changes in both il <dig> and its receptor. it is tempting to speculate that pathogen antagonism has specifically targeted il <dig> complexed with the non-hematopoietic type ii il <dig> receptor , as would be the case for gut and lung resident helminths confronting type ii il <dig> receptor-dependent expulsatory effector mechanisms triggered by il <dig> activation of intestinal and lung epithelia  <cit> .

a functional comparison of two intra-specific murine il <dig> proteins allowed a direct evaluation of the functional consequences of variation at positively selected codon positions without the confounding changes that may occur due to epistasis over long evolutionary divergences . our discovery that genetic variation at three such positively selected residues in murine il <dig> is functionally neutral with respect to both il4rα binding and signaling suggests that the il <dig> site  <dig> epitope displays a remarkable degree of evolutionary flexibility to accommodate changes in sequence to escape  antagonism by parasite-encoded proteins while maintaining interaction with its receptor.

approximately 80% of the il4rα binding energy for il <dig> comes from interactions with a core of  <dig> residues   <cit> . interestingly, these two residues are not invariant in mammalian evolution, which is what might have been expected if this interface were not subject to antagonism  <cit>  . consistent with our hypothesis, alanine scanning mutational analysis has shown that the remaining  <dig> residues comprising the site  <dig> epitope and collectively accounting for the remaining binding energy can accommodate significant amino acid changes without destroying il4rα binding  <cit> . this arrangement may serve to buffer ligand/receptor allelic polymorphism, thereby creating a reservoir of subtly modified interfaces upon which diversifying selection can act to efficiently identify il <dig> variants that have lost the ability to interact with parasite-derived il4-binding molecules. indeed, we can argue that constant antagonism of this interaction interface may have itself selected for this highly diffuse interaction surface; the more diffuse or flexible the il4-il4rα interaction, the easier it would be to emerge victorious from an evolutionary episode of darwinian selection against an antagonist. it will be interesting to determine whether, like the site  <dig> epitope used by the il4rα subunit, the site  <dig> epitope will be able to tolerate amino acid variation without perturbing il13rα <dig> binding.

CONCLUSIONS
we posit that the striking signature of diversifying selection coupled with the absence of a functional consequence on the il4:il4rα interaction provides strong evidence for the existence of a pathogen antagonist that shapes il <dig> evolution. a precedent for our hypothesis comes from a case study of protein kinase r  and its highly conserved substrate eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> alpha . pathogen mimics of eif2α can antagonize the eif2α:pkr interaction. a key to escape this antagonism may be the evolution of a highly flexible pkr epitope responsible for recognition of eif2α  <cit> . similarly, we propose that frequent and intense pathogen antagonism may have fixed an interaction strategy based upon the buffered epitope that characterizes the interaction of il <dig> with il4rα   <cit> . numerous other immune protein:protein interactions bear striking resemblance to the diffuse flexible il <dig> site  <dig> epitope that binds il4rα. it is interesting to speculate that these interfaces also have been borne out of evolutionary conflicts to escape pathogen subversion. validation of this scenario awaits discovery of a pathogen -derived immune antagonist molecule capable of binding and neutralizing il <dig>  based on the location of positively selected residues, it would not be surprising if this antagonist were a mimic of either il <dig> or il4rα  <cit> .
