BACKGROUND
a major goal in biology is to understand the function of each gene. for many organisms, complete genome sequences are now available. combined with knockdown techniques such as rnai or morpholino oligos, genes can be quickly assayed for in vivo function  <cit> . in c. elegans, genome-wide knockdown of gene activity through rnai has provided important phenotypic information for thousands of genes  <cit> . although a useful starting point, much of the phenotypic information lacks detail; for example, many genes are only annotated as essential for viability.

several studies have carried out additional analyses to identify more precise gene functions. in particular, rnai videorecording screens have uncovered very detailed defects allowing genes to be grouped into more specific phenotypic classes  <cit> . however, within each class there still exist groups of genes with different functions. analysing the phenotypes of individual genes in more depth is important for assigning genes to specific functions. through an interest in embryonic polarity, we investigated the function of b <dig> , previously identified as having embryonic polarity defects in a large-scale rnai videorecording screen  <cit> . through phenotypic analyses, we show that b <dig>  shares functions with components of the cell cycle regulator, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome .

the apc/c is a complex of  <dig> subunits in animal cells  that regulates destruction of key cell cycle regulators at the appropriate times by targeting them for degradation by the  <dig> s proteasome through its e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity . in c. elegans, nine of the  <dig> apc/c subunits have been identified based on sequence analysis  <cit> ; cdc <dig>  apc <dig>  and apc <dig> were not identified. for seven subunits, loss of function using mutants or rnai causes an arrest at metaphase of meiosis i; for two , weak embryonic lethality was seen along with germline maintenance problems consistent with mitotic defects .

RESULTS
b <dig>  is required for the metaphase to anaphase transition of meiosis i
in large scale rnai videorecording screens, rnai of b <dig>  was shown to cause different phenotypes: loss of asymmetry in the first cell division or one cell arrest due to failure to pass through meiosis  <cit> ; to understand the role of b <dig>  in cell division, we examined the rnai phenotype in detail.

we first carried out a time course of rnai feeding of b <dig>  and examined embryos laid at different times after rnai was initiated in the mother . rnai knockdown increases in strength during the time course. there was an increase in lethality from  <dig> % at 24– <dig> hours post feeding to 100% at  <dig> hours post feeding or later. the terminal arrest phenotypes of the embryos changed over time. at 24– <dig> hours post feeding, most arrested embryos contained many cells whereas embryos laid  <dig> hours after initiation of rnai feeding arrested as a single cell . at intermediate time points, both types of terminal arrest embryos were seen .

to investigate the arrest stage of the embryos after strong rnai of b <dig>  we examined the pattern of dna condensation of embryos inside the uterus using a gfp::histone reporter gene. compared to the wild-type where progressively older embryos have progressively more cells , embryos in the uteri of b <dig>  mothers all showed the dna condensation typical of metaphase of meiosis i . staining these arrested embryos for tubulin confirmed that embryos arrested with a meiosis i metaphase-like spindle . this phenotype is similar to that reported for mutants or strong rnai of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome  subunits  <cit> . we confirmed that the phenotype of strong b <dig>  embryos described above is identical to that seen after rnai of apc/c component emb-27/cdc <dig> . these results indicate that like apc/c components, b <dig>  is required for progression from metaphase to anaphase of meiosis i.

weak depletion of b <dig>  causes embryonic polarity defects
we next examined the phenotype of embryos laid after shorter maternal rnai of b <dig> , which should cause a weaker depletion. in wild-type embryos, the first cell division is asymmetric, occurring at 56% embryo length . in contrast, we found that first division in b <dig>  embryos is much more symmetric, occurring on average at 52% embryo length . this suggests that b <dig>  embryos have a defect in embryonic polarity.

in wild-type embryos, polarity is initiated during the first cell cycle, leading to the asymmetric localisation of par polarity proteins, with a complex of par-3/par-6/pkc- <dig> at the anterior cortex and par- <dig> and par- <dig> at the posterior cortex . these proteins are required for the posterior displacement of the first mitotic spindle, which leads to an asymmetric cell division. in par mutant embryos, the first division is symmetric instead of asymmetric and the remaining par proteins are often mislocalized  <cit> .

to determine whether rnai of b <dig>  affected par polarity, we examined the localization of par- <dig> and par- <dig> in weakly affected b <dig>  embryos. we found that these par proteins were abnormally distributed in 82%  of such embryos, compared to 0% abnormal distribution in wild-type embryos , indicating a defect in embryonic polarity. in most of b <dig>  embryos, par- <dig> was expanded to encompass the entire cortex whereas par- <dig> was found in cytoplasmic puncta . this pattern is strikingly similar to that seen in partial loss of function mutants or weak rnai of apc/c subunits emb-27/cdc <dig>  mat-1/cdc <dig>  mat-2/apc <dig>  mat-3/cdc <dig>  and emb-30/apc <dig>  <cit> . the similarity in the range of phenotypes induced by rnai of b <dig>  and apc/c components argues that b <dig>  functions with the apc/c.

b <dig>  shows homology to the apc/c subunit cdc26
there are two alternatively spliced isoforms of b <dig>  inferred from the sequence of ests, called b <dig> a and b <dig> b, which are predicted to encode proteins of 175aa and 187aa, respectively  <cit> . the final intron predicted in wormbase  <cit>  is not removed in the ests, making the proteins shorter than originally proposed due to an earlier stop codon. homology searches using blastp  <cit>  with standard settings against the non-redundant protein database  did not uncover any similarity of b <dig>  to any known protein. however, blastp searches against the s. cerevisiae protein database revealed homology of the n-terminus of b <dig>  to the n-terminus of cdc <dig> 

budding yeast cdc <dig> encodes a small protein of  <dig> aa that is dispensable for proliferation at 25°c but essential for progression through mitosis at 37°c  <cit> . the protein resides within the apc/c where it stabilizes the association of the tpr repeat proteins cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> with other subunits of the complex  <cit> . proteins related to cdc <dig> have been found in the apc/c isolated from fission yeast and human cells  <cit> . although the b <dig>  sequence is longer than those of other cdc <dig> orthologues, it shares with all these proteins a conserved pattern of charged and large, hydrophobic residues at the very n-terminus . in contrast, the c-terminal regions of cdc <dig> orthologues lack detectable sequence conservation. indeed, the first  <dig> amino acids of s. cerevisiae cdc <dig> are sufficient for proliferation albeit at a reduced rate  <cit> .

b <dig>  complements a budding yeast cdc <dig> mutant
to test whether b <dig>  could functionally replace cdc <dig>  we expressed it in s. cerevisiae cells lacking the endogenous cdc <dig> gene. as shown in figure 4a, the b <dig>  plasmid but not the empty vector restored proliferation of cdc26Δ mutant cells at 37°c. complementation was remarkably robust: cdc26Δ cells expressing b <dig>  grew with wild-type kinetics and were normal with respect to cell size, budding index, and cellular dna content . expression of b <dig>  failed to rescue the temperature-sensitive growth defect of cells lacking another apc/c subunit, doc1/apc <dig>  this result demonstrates that b <dig>  provides cdc <dig> function to the yeast cells but does not rescue a general defect in apc/c activity.

CONCLUSIONS
our functional and phenotypic assays indicate that b <dig>  encodes the c. elegans apc/c subunit cdc <dig> and accordingly we have named it cdc- <dig>  inhibition of cdc- <dig> activity leads to the same range of defects as seen after inhibition of other apc/c subunits, namely embryonic polarity defects after weak knockdown, and meiotic metaphase i arrest following strong knockdown. consistent with the role of yeast cdc <dig> in stabilizing the association of cdc <dig> with other subunits, a large-scale two-hybrid study in c. elegans showed that cdc- <dig> binds to apc/c component emb-27/cdc <dig>  <cit> .

previous studies had identified c. elegans homologs of  <dig> of the  <dig> known human apc/c subunits . no sequences with significant matches to cdc <dig>  apc <dig>  or apc <dig> had been found. this study illustrates the power of rna interference screens coupled with detailed phenotypic analyses in assigning gene function. rnai embryo videorecording data for hundreds of genes are available  <cit> . in many cases, the defects observed in these movies give insight into the biological process affected. further study of genes in different phenotypic classes will provide a deeper understanding into the mechanisms of shared cell division processes. for example, careful analyses of these data may lead to the identification of c. elegans apc <dig> and apc <dig>
