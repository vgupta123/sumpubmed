BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas of approximately 22-nucleotides. they play important roles in gene regulation at post-transcriptional level. they are able to repress the activity of complementary mrnas by targeting the 3'-untranslated regions  <cit> . release  <dig> of the mirbase database contains more than  <dig> mature mirna sequences for human  <cit> . aberrant mirna expression was shown related to the generation of cancer stem cells and the tumour genesis  <cit> . microarray-based technologies have routinely been used for profiling molecular expression in cancer. microarray allows simultaneous expression profiling of tens of thousands of genes in normal versus malignant cells. the growing number of microarray expression datasets has necessitated the integrative analysis approaches to identify significant molecular patterns across multiple datasets.

many efforts have been made in search of common molecular signatures, however without obvious success. this is partly due to the highly heterogeneous nature of cancer. tumour samples often comprise of subpopulations with different genomic alterations. however, the most popular outlier detection algorithm, t-test or its analogues, simply removes heterogeneity between subtypes, and fail to identify the subgroup-specific gene alterations  <cit> . recently novel statistical methods were developed to identify patterns only existed in the subgroups of the studied samples  <cit> .

in this study, we applied these outlier detection methods to analyze our collection of four mirna expression microarray datasets to identify differentially expressed mirnas . the de-mirnas were then compared among the four data sets at both gene and gene set  levels for comparison. by considering the cancer heterogeneity, we applied different statistical methods to identify the consistent prostate cancer  associated pathways that are coordinately targeted by mirnas.

RESULTS
comparison of heterogeneous feature detection algorithms
most of the previous expression data studies used fold-change, t-test and other statistics alike to detect cancer-related genes. recently, it has been recognized that many oncogenes show altered expression in only a small proportion of cancer samples  <cit> . such features will be removed when using t-test or t-test like methods because they average gene expression levels in all the studied samples. tomlins et al. concluded that t-tests were not adequate for detecting heterogeneous patterns of oncogenes  <cit> .

to address this complexity, a series of new heterogeneous detection algorithms have been proposed in recent years. among these methods are least sum of ordered subset squared   <cit> , cancer outlier profile analysis   <cit> , maximum ordered subset t-statistics   <cit> , outlier robust t-statistics   <cit> , and outlier sum   <cit> .

the performance of the above algorithms and the traditional t-test were compared on the detection of the outliers in our collection of prostate cancer  associated microrna expression data. the outliers here refer to the deferentially expressed micrornas . for all these methods applied to the different data sets with different numbers of samples, we set the quantile of outliers to  <dig>  . those de-mirnas detected by at least three methods were considered to be putative pca associated outliers, and then the percentages of the putative outliers in the original result of each method were calculated to determine the method's accuracy . in most of the cases, these heterogeneity feature detection algorithms performed better than the traditional t-test. in most of this comparison, ort performed better than the other methods. for these four studied datasets, ort had the biggest median observation and smallest standard deviation. therefore, we take the result by ort for the downstream analyses.

the outlier mirna targets in prostate cancer
as mirnas play a role in post-transcriptional regulation by targeting complementary mrnas, we collection their putative targets and subsequently mapped these target genes to pathways or gene sets for enrichment analysis. target genes were retrieved from both targetscan database and our integrative prediction . additional file  <dig> shows the target genes of the pca associated de-mirnas. at last,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> target genes of the de-mirnas of four different datasets were obtained respectively.

the identification of the microrna regulatory pathways in prostate cancer
the collection of the four different datasets are from different platforms, the overlapping of mirna probes between these data are about 40~60% while the detected differently expressed mirna profiles only have 3% overlapping  <cit> . we aim to identify the consistent pattern at high level. first, the target genes of de-mirnas found by at least  <dig> datasets were extracted, then mapped to function and pathway databases, e.g. go  <cit> , kegg  <cit>  and genego , to identify pca-associated functions and pathways. in this process, we identified  <dig> target genes of the pca associated de-mirnas, among which  <dig> were shared by all the four target gene datasets, and  <dig> overlapped in three of the four datasets. as shown in figure  <dig>  the ligand-independent activation of esr <dig> and esr <dig> is the most significant genego pathway . in figure  <dig>  insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  encodes the protein involved in mediating growth and development. in this pathway, igf- <dig> binds to igf- <dig> receptor on the membrane and activates signal transduction through shc, sos, mek <dig>  and erk <dig>  finally mediating the production of esr <dig> and esr <dig>  genes involved in the signal transduction above are all target genes of highly expressed mirnas in prostate cancer samples; therefore, the expression of esr <dig> and esr <dig> will be down-regulated which is in accordance with the previous report by gamba and his co-authors  <cit> .

analysis and validation of the putative microrna regulatory pathways in prostate cancer
among the  <dig> enriched genego pathways,  <dig>  pathways were also significantly enriched in our previous study in which we processed  <dig> mrna microarray datasets  <cit> . in the set of top  <dig> genego pathways in our previous work,  <dig>  were also detected in the  <dig> pathways in this study .

to identify potential microrna regulatory pathways in prostate cancer, the  <dig> most significantly enriched  pathways were chosen for the analysis. of those, four had previously been reported to be related to prostate cancer in pubmed citations. we verified the other  <dig> pathways indirectly by analysis of the component genes in pubmed citations although the wet-lab experiments can direct validate them . among the top  <dig> pathways reported by both the previously and the present studies,  <dig> pathways are the same in both studies,  <dig> of the  <dig> pathways are novel ones i.e., 1) ligand-independent activation of esr <dig> and esr <dig>  this is the most significant pathway we mentioned in the last section, and 2) membrane-bound esr1: interaction with growth factors signalling.

*the citation count was calculated by searching the pathway names in title and abstract fields of pubmed.

Â§pathways with this mark are also in the top <dig> pathways of our previous study  <cit> .

the following two pathways are novel pathways identified by both the present and the previous studies. 1) ligand-independent activation of esr <dig> and esr2; 2) membrane-bound esr1: interaction with growth factors signalling.

pubmed citation counts of corresponding genes in each potential pathway can be found in additional file  <dig>  according to pubmed citation results, the percentages of reported pca related genes in each pathway range from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. these percentages will be changed with the pubmed update, since more researches were performed to investigate the caner hallmarks related pathways, some pathways may be overrepresented in the pubmed database while others may have less citations. the results of pubmed citations indirectly verified the link between the pathways and the prostate cancer, although experimental validation is needed for further confirmation.

discussion
in this study, we collected four prostate cancer mirna microarray datasets. these datasets were processed with outlier detection statistical methods considering cancer heterogeneity. this is the first work to compare the performance of heterogeneity feature detection statistical methods with real mirna datasets. the analysis indicates these novel algorithms generally perform better than the t-test. all the methods are important and they may show different performance for different data sets, we could select the best methods based on the consensus analysis.

the comparison of the previous study  <cit>  with the present one indicates the high consistency between the integrative analysis of the microrna and the mrna microarray expression datasets. we here identified  <dig> novel pca associated pathways . two novel pathways among the top  <dig> in both studies are identified. these overlapping pathways can be potential key pathways contributing to prostate carcinogenesis. among the key genes in these two novel pathways, histone deacetylaces  was reported abnormally expressed in prostate cancer  <cit> . additionally, the igf family is involved in the regulation of prostate growth and bone metastasis  <cit> . in prostate cancer cells, the igf- <dig> receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor related to tumour progression and metastasis, is highly expressed with mt1-mmp, a metalloproteinase involved in prostate cancer metastasis  <cit> . abnormal hif expression mediates vital processes such as cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis  <cit> . activin a inhibits prostatic branching and growth  <cit>  and enhances prostate cancer cell migration  <cit> . additionally, il <dig> activates neutrophils and dendritic cells and generates cytotoxic t lymphocytes against cancer cells  <cit> , so the blocking of the il <dig> signalling pathway weakens the immune system's ability to resist cancers. additional file  <dig> shows the pubmed citation counts of corresponding genes of each potential pathway in prostate cancer. more wet-lab experiments are suggested to verify the functions of these pathways in prostate cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, heterogeneity feature detection methods were evaluated and applied to the identification of the novel microrna regulatory pathways in prostate cancer and  <dig> novel pca associated pathways were identified. comparing the present study on pca microrna expression data with our previous work on pca gene expression data, we identified two important novel pathways among the top  <dig> of the two studies.
