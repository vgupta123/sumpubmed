BACKGROUND
solid tumours comprise cancer cells, resident stromal cells, and migratory haemopoietic cells. intricate interactions between the cell types regulate tumour growth, progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis. macrophages are an important element of these microenvironment interactions  <cit> . they may represent either m <dig> or m <dig> phenotype. the classical activation by microbial products is that of the m <dig> phenotype , whereas alternative activation  drives macrophages conversion toward the m <dig> phenotype. cancer cells are known to release various chemoattractants which recruit macrophages to colonize the tumour site  <cit> . on the other hand, counter-activated tumour-associated macrophages  produce chemokines, cytokines, growth and angiogenic factors  <cit> , thus they actively contribute to tumour progression and their transition to malignancy. exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon seems to be utterly important. therefore, to view and explain the molecular interactions between the cancer cells and tams, we established an in vitro co-culture and conducted a global gene expression analysis using dna microarrays of macrophages and cancer cells. neither there is an abundance of microarray data on the global gene expression in tams  <cit>  available, nor there is much information on the changes of cancer cells and their gene expression whilst cultured with macrophages.

the findings confirm that cancer cells under co-culture conditions acquired the macrophage-specific antigen expression. it could as well be indicative of these cells also having other phenotypic characteristics of macrophages, such as: capabilities of cell rolling, spreading, diapedesis, or migration, that allow the metastasis process. our in vitro studies confirmed that macrophages enhance tumour migration and invasion.

methods
cell lines
the cell lines used for the study have previously been used in other published research  <cit> . two canine mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines , anaplastic cancer cell line , simple carcinoma cell line  and spindle-cell mammary tumor cell line  were examined. cmt-w <dig> and cmt-w <dig> cell lines were kindly donated by prof. dr. maciej ugorski and dr. joanna polanska from wroclaw university , cmt-u <dig> cell line was kindly donated by dr. eva hellmen from swedish agricultural university  and p <dig> cell line was kindly donated by dr. gerard rutteman from utrecht university .

cells were cultured under optimal conditions: a medium rpmi- <dig> enriched with 10%  heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum , penicillin-streptomycin , and fungizone  , in an atmosphere of 5% co <dig> and 95% humidified air at 37°c, and routinely subcultured every other day.

canine blood mononuclear cell separation
the anticoagulated whole blood from healthy dogs  was collected for routine diagnostic purposes . the remaining volume of the blood samples was taken to our analyses  and immediately subjected to a mononuclear cell separation using accuspin system-histopaque  <dig>  according to the manufacturer's protocol. the blood specimen was placed on a porous high-density polyethylene barrier, separating lower chamber containing the histopaque- <dig> solution, in a sterile centrifuge tube. the tube was centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min at room temperature. on centrifugation, erythrocytes and granulocytes descend through the frit to pellet below the histopaque- <dig>  lymphocytes and monocytes remained above the frit on the plasma-histopaque- <dig> interface. this layer of cells was aseptically removed with a pipette and transferred to a sterile 15-ml centrifuge tube. then, the cells were washed with pbs once and subjected to further procedures.

monocyte sorting and culturing
the isolated mononuclear blood cells were incubated for an hour at room temperature with mouse monoclonal anti-cd <dig> fitc-conjugated  antibodies  applied in a volume recommended by the manufacturer of  <dig> μl per  <dig> cells suspended in  <dig> μl. the leukocytes were analyzed using facs aria ii . the monocytes were at first identified and gated based on the morphological criteria  as an intermediate in size  and with an intricate nuclear configuration  cells . the cytogram showed that most of the granulocytes were eliminated during the mononuclear cells isolation. then, the cd64-positive cells were gated  and specificity of staining was checked, showing only the cd64-positive cells on the cytogram .

the cd64-positive monocytes were then separated and grown as a co-culture with cancer cells, as well as a mono-culture. the culturing conditions were the same as those for cancer cells. according to the subject data, culturing of monocytes for  <dig> hrs is sufficient for their differentiation towards macrophages  <cit> .

co-culture
in this model, cancer cells  were grown on separated flasks, and sorted monocytes were then layered on the top of each cell line. an orange celltracker fluorescent dye cmtmr  was used to stain the cancer cells population before the sorted monocyte population was added. staining was accomplished by incubation in serum/antibiotics-free rpmi medium containing  <dig> μm cmtmr  for  <dig> min at 37°c. subsequently, the medium was aspirated, and the cancer cells were washed twice with pbs and incubated with complete rpmi for  <dig> hr. sorted monocytes were placed on the cmtmr-stained cancer cells.

the co-culture was maintained for at least  <dig> h. then, the co-cultured cells were harvested by trypsynization and sorted using facs aria ii  into two tubes: unstained macrophages and stained cancer cells .

rna isolation, validation, amplification, reverse transcription, labeling and hybridization
the sorted macrophages and cancer cells grown as the co-culture were centrifuged  in separated tubes, whereas cancer cells and macrophages grown as mono-cultures were washed with pbs and next scraped and centrifuged  in separated tubes. the total rna from the samples was isolated using a total rna kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol. isolated rna samples were dissolved in rnase-free water. the quantity of rna was measured using nanodrop . the samples with adequate amounts of rna were treated with dnasei to eliminate a possibility of dna contamination. the samples were subsequently purified using rneasy minielute cleanup kit . finally rna samples were analyzed using bioanalyzer  to measure the final rna quality and integrity.

the quick amp labeling kit  was used to amplify and label target rna to generate complementary rna  for oligo microarrays used in gene expression profiling and other downstream analyses. the gene expression of each cancer cell line, grown under co-culture conditions with macrophages, was compared against the gene expression of the same cancer cell line grown as a mono-culture . the gene expression of macrophages grown as a co-culture with cancer cell lines was compared against the gene expression of macrophages grown as the mono-culture. each sample was examined in a dye-swap to eliminate the effect of label factor. thus, each biological condition was labelled once by cy <dig> and once by cy <dig>  taking the average of two labelled arrays, the dye effect on any particular gene was cancelled. the hybridization was performed with canine-specific amadid release ge  <dig> ×  <dig> k microarrays  using gene expression hybridization kit  according to the manufacturer's protocol.

signal detection, quantification and analysis
acquisition and analysis of hybridization intensities were performed using dna microarray scanner . then, the results were extracted using agilent's feature extraction software with normalization and robust statistical analyses. results were analyzed for statistical purposes using feature extraction and gene spring software . the unpaired t-test with benjamin-hochberg fdr < 5%  correction was applied . for further analysis we hierarchically clustered the genes and chose only those with values within upper and lower cut-off  in each of the slide. we analyzed only genes that were regulated in all the examined samples within the group  whose expression changed at least 3-fold in each of examined slide. in this experimental model we examined each of the sample in duplicate , whereas significant genes were chosen from five biological repetitions . the area of the analyses covered in this publication has been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus and is accessible via geo series accession number gse <dig> 

gene function was identified using the panther pathway analysis software  <cit>  and pathway studio software . panther on-line platform allowed for wide analysis of the canis familiaris regulated genes and also for statistical analysis of number of regulated genes involved in specific pathways or biological functions compared to the normal healthy cell of this specie.

confocal microscopy
the co-culture of cancer cells with macrophages was conducted as described above. the cancer cells grown as mono-culture and as a co-cultures were stained using orange celltracker fluorescent dye cmtmr, as described above. cancer cells and macrophages grown as mono-cultures, as well as the co-culture were fixed with 70% ethanol  and washed three times in pbs. cells were permeabilized with  <dig> % triton x-100/pbs , washed with pbs twice and incubated for  <dig> hr at room temperature with: mouse monoclonal anti-cd <dig> fitc-conjugated  antibodies  and mouse monoclonal anti-cd <dig> fitc-conjugated  antibodies  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the cells were then washed three times with pbs and the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using icn mounting medium.

the cell imaging was performed by confocal laser scanning microscope fv- <dig> system . the combination of excitation/emission were: argon  <dig> nm laser with 505- <dig> nm filter for fitc and hene  <dig> nm laser with  <dig> nm filter for cmtmr staining. the pictures were gathered separately for each fluorescence channel. the cells were examined using the fluoview program .

wound-healing assay
to assess the ability to migration of cancer cells grown as a co-culture with macrophages, we applied a wound-healing test. the cancer cells  were separately seeded in multi-well plates and then , using a pipette tip  a straight scratch has been made, simulating a wound. the images were captured at the beginning and at regular intervals  during cell migration to close the wound. the images then were compared to quantify migration rate of the cells. this method is particularly suitable for studies of cell-cell interaction on cell migration  <cit> . the pictures has been analyzed using a computer-assisted image analyzer .

invasion assay
bd biocoat matrigel™ invasion chambers  pre-coated with bd matrigel matrix were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. the assay insert plates were prepared by rehydrating the bd matrigel matrix coating with phosphate buffered saline for two hrs at 37°c. the rehydration solution was carefully removed,  <dig>  ×  <dig> of control cancer cells or cancer cells grown as co-culture with macrophages  was added to each apical chamber and  <dig>  ml rpmi- <dig> containing chemoattractant  was added to the basal chamber. uncoated insert plates, included as invasion controls, were used without rehydration. assay plates were incubated for  <dig> hrs at standard culturing conditions.  <dig>  μg/ml calcein am were added to  <dig> μl dmso and then,  <dig> μl was transferred to  <dig> ml hanks buffered saline dispense.  <dig>  ml calcein solution was then transferred into each well of 24-well plate. the medium from insert was removed and multiwell inserts were transferred to the plate containing  <dig>  ml/well calcein. plates were incubated an hour at standard culture conditions. the fluorescence of invaded cells was measured with excitation wave length  <dig> nm and emission wave length em  <dig> nm using tecan infinite  <dig> reader .

3d culture
cancer cells were treated with trypsin and resuspended in culture medium.  <dig> mm culture plates  were coated with  <dig> μl of growth factor reduced matrigel  and left to solidify for  <dig> min. at 37°c. the cells were then plated at a concentration of  <dig> cells/ml. the growth of cells on matrigel was observed every day under phase-contrast microscope.

statistical analysis
the analysis for statistical purposes was conducted using prism version  <dig>  software . the two-way anova, anova + tukey hsd  post-hoc test and t-test were applied. the p-value <  <dig>  was regarded as significant whereas p-value <  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig>  as highly significant.

RESULTS
sorting of the co-cultured cells
flow cytometry had easily distinguished the cmtmr-stained cells from the unstained macrophages  and allowed a further proper sorting of each population . the co-culture was maintained for at least  <dig> h. the differential staining prolonged for such period of time  showed no detrimental effect on proliferation and plating efficiency. the fluorescence intensity of the stained cancer cells after the 3-days co-culture with macrophages was the same as that of the control cancer cells grown as a mono-culture . similar culture conditions had previously been described  <cit> .

our facs sorting isolated a 97-99% pure population on postsort, with a positive result comparable to other reported data available  <cit> . sorting purity was also assessed using fluorescence microscopy .

monocyte differentiation
the morphological assessment of the monocytes culture  using confocal microscopy confirmed that after the  <dig> hrs they were partially differentiated into macrophages  despite no stimulation with growth factors. these results are consistent with the data available on the subject, showing that the 3-day monocyte culturing leads to their partial differentiation toward the macrophages phenotype  <cit> . the colonies were stained using anti-cd <dig>  and anti-cd <dig> antibodies . analysis of stained cells and image contrast obtained with nomarski interference contrast  showed that all the macrophages expressed cd <dig> antigen as well as cd <dig> what can also confirm monocyte differentiation towards macrophages  <cit> .

global gene expression analysis
the gene spring  hierarchical clustering depicted similar gene expression in each of the dye-swap experiments  what indicates that all microarray samples were successfully labelled, hybridized, scanned and that they are highly reproducible. the unpaired t-test with benjamin-hochberg fdr < 5%  correction  and further panther analysis revealed  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in cancer cells grown in co-culture with macrophages with values within upper and lower cut-off  in each of the slide . only the genes whose expression had changed at least 3-fold in each of the examined slide were chosen for further analyses. these up/down-regulated genes were common for each cell line examined individually, when compared with the same cell line grown as a mono-culture.

the most important biological processes in macrophages grown as a co-culture were cell-matrix adhesion  and cell-cell adhesion .

the results were confirmed at mrna level using real-time qpcr analysis
for the purposes of the microarray data validation, we have selected  <dig> genes that may play the most important role in cancer cells-macrophages interactions: ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cd <dig>  csf1r, hif <dig>  il- <dig>  mmp <dig>  vegf-c, and wnt7b. real-time qpcr results showed similar trends in gene expression modulations as were observed in microarray studies. the real-time qpcr confirmed the ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cd <dig>  csf1r, mmp <dig>  hif <dig>  vegf-c up-regulation in cancer cells grown as a co-culture with macrophages. the analysis also confirmed down-regulation of ccl <dig>  il <dig>  and up-regulation of wnt7b genes in macrophages grown under co-culture conditions with cancer cells .

confocal microscopy and ihc analysis revealed myeloid-lineages markers expression in cancer cells following the co-culturing with macrophages
the microarray analysis revealed that the co-culturing of cancer cells with macrophages initiated the myeloid-specific antigens expression in cancer cells. thus, to confirm this data the confocal analysis was conducted. the expression of two monocytes/macrophages-specific antigens was assessed: cd <dig> and cd <dig>  the cancer cells grown as mono-culture did not show expression of both antigens , whereas the strong expression of these two markers was detected when the cancer cells were co-cultured with macrophages . the confocal observations also showed that macrophages co-exist closely with the cancer cells, even forming cell fusions.

ihc analysis also confirmed acquisition of macrophage's marker by cancer cells after co-culture. the expression of csf-1r antigen was significantly higher  in all the cancer cell lines after co-culturing with macrophages . thus, the co-culture conditions induced or increased macrophage antigens expression by cancer cells.

migration assay
the wound healing assay showed that in all of the cancer cell lines the co-culturing with macrophages increased their migratory abilities . cmt-u <dig> cells grown with macrophages completely closed the wound  in  <dig> hrs, whereas cmt-u <dig> control cells after  <dig> hrs closed  <dig> % of the wound. similarly, cmt-u <dig> and p <dig> cells  after  <dig> hrs almost completely closed the wound , whereas control cells closed only 49% and 54%  of the wound. cmt-w <dig> cells grown with macrophages completely closed the wound after  <dig> hrs, whereas cmt-w <dig> control cells after  <dig> hrs . cmt-w <dig> cells grown with macrophages closed 80% of the wound after  <dig> hrs, whereas control cells closed only 52% of the wound.

invasion assay and 3d culture
invasion assay showed that not all of the cancer cells have migratory abilities. only cmt-w <dig> and cmt-w <dig> control cells migrated throw the matrigel . the co-culturing of these cells for  <dig> hrs with macrophages significantly increased their migratory abilities . the fluorescence intensity related to the cmt-w <dig> control cells migration was  <dig> , whereas to the cmt-w <dig> cell line grown with macrophages was  <dig>  . the fluorescence intensity related to the cmt-w <dig> control cells migration was  <dig> , whereas to the cmt-w <dig> cell line grown with macrophages was  <dig>  .

to confirm the ability of these cell lines to matrix invasion, we have assessed their growth characteristics on matrigel matrix . after  <dig> hrs of culturing  on matrigel cmt-u <dig>  cmt-u <dig> and p <dig> cell lines formed colonies, whereas cmt-w <dig> and cmt-w <dig> cell lines formed branching structures  what indicated their invasive phenotype. the culture was maintained for  <dig> week, showing that after  <dig> days also p <dig> cell line formed slight branches.

discussion
it has been evident over the last few years that macrophages play an important role  in tumour cell invasion of the normal surrounding tissues, cancer proliferation and metastasis to local and distant sites  <cit> . all the interactions within the tumour are intricately complex and a better understanding of them would require some further exploration of the underlying molecular processes.

in this article, we demonstrated that co-culturing of canine mammary cancer cells and macrophages initiate a dynamic 'chemical conversation' between the tumour cells and macrophages. they also start to behave as one organism. many of the previous studies have been conducted using cancer cells and macrophages grown without direct contact in trans-well inserts or modified boyden chambers  <cit> , however there are also very few reports on direct co-culturing of macrophages and cancer cells  <cit> . despite that direct co-culturing of macrophages and cancer cells  can be a good experimental model, because it reflects in vivo conditions more vividly  than co-culturing where the cells can contact via soluble factors only, direct co-culturing brings about the risk of macrophages contamination by cancer cells owing to macrophages taking up fragments of cancer cells. to assess the possible risk of artificial sorting of macrophages  as cancer cells  we checked our post-sort population using fluorescence microscopy . our co-culture has also been assessed using confocal microscopy . it showed that cancer cells were perfectly bright stained with cmtmr . these cells also showed green-stained pattern due to the macrophages-specific antigen expression. thus, we confirmed that we sorted the population of cancer cells showing macrophages-specific antigens. we have also observed very few macrophages with very small amount of red dye in their phagosomes which probably were digested fragments of cancer cells , but we observed attentively only the macrophages without any red dye. during cell sorting we only took cells with high percp-area red-signal  and gated for sorting only the high-positive cancer cells as opposed to macrophages with low signal. even if some macrophages happen to have red dye in phagosome, they would have been somewhere between these two gates or qualified as macrophages. bearing in mind that the possibility of contamination of macrophages rna samples by cancer rna is even less, as macrophages produce ribonucleases  <cit>  that immediately degrade any digested  rna molecules. moreover, the possibility that macrophages can take up cancer cells during in vitro culturing is as likely as in a naturally occurring tumour in vivo, but researchers run a risk because the problem is extremely interesting and requires investigation  <cit> .

the present microarray analysis of five various canine mammary cancer cell lines and canine macrophages grown together, revealed significant changes in genes expression in comparison to the same cells grown as mono-cultures.

under co-culture conditions the cancer cells express the macrophages-specific antigens, e.g. cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  csf1r . according to subject literature, cd <dig> is expressed not only by normal monocytes/macrophages but also by neoplasms  <cit> . cd163-positive cancers had more severe histological aberrations due to genomic instability. thus, it is hypothesized  <cit>  that tumour cells express atypical genes  due to genomic instability. this may be caused by the presence of various proteins secreted by macrophages and changes induced by them on the microenvironment. another theory explaining why cancer cells may exhibit myeloid cells-specific antigens is that the cells fuse, forming hybrids that adopt phenotypic features of both parental cells  <cit> . cancer cells may fuse spontaneously with several types of somatic cells  <cit> . some authors suggest that the result of cancer-myeloid cell fusion is the hybrid with a metastatic phenotype  <cit> . the tumour cells that express myeloid antigens may also exhibit other phenotypic characteristics of macrophages, such as capabilities of cell rolling, spreading, dissociation, diapedesis, migration and matrix invasion. the metastatic cancer cells have all these capacities because the process of metastasis requires a coordinated steps promoting angiogenesis, controlling adhesion, proteolysis and motility. our confocal imaging and ihc examination has proven that under co-culture conditions expression of macrophages markers  in almost all of the cancer cells was initiated. moreover, migration and invasion assays showed that the presence of macrophages in cancer microenvironment triggers migration in all of the cancer cell lines. the co-culturing of macrophages increased invasion in the cell lines that show high invasive abilities in control conditions. the ability of cd <dig> receptor  to trigger the production of pro-inflammatory mediators  <cit>  may be a key factor that brings changes to the cancer cell biology and stimulates it to cytokines/chemokines/growth factors production for further myeloid cell attraction.

our microarray analysis of cancer cells grown with macrophages revealed the over-manifestation of genes activity which are involved in macrophages-cancer cells 'conversation'. we found up-regulation of the highly potent macrophage attracting factors: ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  as well as ccr <dig> in cancer cells grown as co-culture with macrophages. recent studies have demonstrated that ccl <dig> acts directly  in an autocrine manner on several human carcinomas regulating the migration and invasive properties of tumour cells  <cit> . furthermore, ccl3-ccr <dig> axis can increase the mmp- <dig> expression contributing to angiogenesis, ecm degradation and metastasis. our gene expression analysis seems to support both hypotheses, as besides ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccr <dig> up-regulation, we also observed increased expression of mmp- <dig> in cancer cells grown under co-culture conditions with macrophages.

we found down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cd <dig> in macrophages grown as co-culture with cancer cells. we also found down-regulation of several key inflammation cytokines and macrophage activators, such as: ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ccr5; whereas up-regulation of other inflammation cytokines: cxcl <dig>  csf- <dig>  decrease of the expression of these genes in macrophages grown with cancer cells as co-cultures may be induced by hypoxia. down-regulation of ccl <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> genes in macrophages under hypoxic conditions has been demonstrated by various authors  <cit> . this phenomenon has a biological explanation, as decrease of ccl <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> expression inhibits chemotaxis signalling what in turn prevents tams from leaving hypoxic areas  <cit>  and triggers their angiogenic effect . up-regulation of hif- <dig> in cancer cells may indicate hypoxic conditions in co-culture . hypoxia additionally regulates angiogenesis by up-regulating vegf-c in cancer cells and it initiates their epithelial-mesenchymal transition   <cit> .

our gene expression analysis also revealed up-regulation of csf- <dig>  in macrophages grown as co-culture with cancer cells and csf- <dig>  csf- <dig> and csf1r up-regulation in cancer cells grown together with macrophages. csfs are potent factors regulating the survival and differentiation of macrophages being their chemoattractants  <cit> . the csf-1r expression in normal mice and humans is limited to macrophages  <cit> . however, in many tumours csf-1r and csfs are also expressed in cancer cells. csf-1r expression at protein level was also confirmed in this study . for example, co-expression of csf- <dig> and its receptor can be found in 50% of late stage breast and 70% of endometrial cancers  <cit> . during the course of our previous studies we found the csf-1r expression in canine mammary cancer cells , as well as in tumour-associated macrophages  <cit> . the results of the studies of kirma et al.  <cit>  suggest that the csfs might have an autocrine role through csf1r in epithelial tumour cells promoting their invasiveness into the surrounding matrix  <cit> .

all genes given above are important to entrap macrophages in malignant tumours  <cit> .

in macrophages grown as co-culture with cancer cells expression of three ligands of wnt pathway increased significantly: wnt5b, wnt7a and wnt7b. although the wnt activation has been described by many authors in various cancer cells  <cit> , only one study, so far  <cit> , described the wnt activation in macrophages taken from mice tumours. the authors described mechanism, by which macrophages stimulate wnt signalling pathway in vascular endothelial cells by wnt7b. this signalling cascade eventually results in the vascular remodelling. thus, the new hypothesis is proposed, that the subpopulation of macrophages, modulating wnt-signalling is located along the tumour vasculature to regulate endothelial cells proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on the results of hereby study and the available literature we conclude that the presence of macrophages in the cancer environment induces expression of macrophage-specific antigens in cancer cells. it may be caused by macrophage-cancer cell fusion or may be induced by chemokines. this macrophage-specific gene expression induces production of the pro-inflammatory mediators by cancer cells, that stimulate not only further monocytes recruitment from blood vessels and their differentiation into adult macrophages, but also cancer migration and angiogenesis . moreover, we have showed that the presence of macrophages increases cancer cells migration and invasion. thus, we suppose that gaining the macrophages phenotype by cancer cells constitutes one of the most important elements that increase their possibility to metastasize. moreover, the 'cross-talk' between these cells leads to up-regulation of wnt genes in macrophages increasing new vessels formation.
