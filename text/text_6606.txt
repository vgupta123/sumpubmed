BACKGROUND
recurrent and common genomic amplifications have led to the discovery of important oncogenes and cancer therapeutic targets. the 20q <dig> amplification including the znf <dig> gene coding for a transcription factor is found in ~ 20-30% of breast cancers and is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, shorter disease-free survival, chemoresistance, and poor prognosis  <cit> . a recent report shows that znf <dig> overexpression accelerates aberrant cell differentiation through signaling events leading to increased self-renewal capacity, a mesenchymal phenotype, motility, chemoresistance and metastasis in mammary mouse models  <cit> . earlier work using chip-chip tiling arrays for the 5 kb dna region surrounding the transcriptional start site  identified znf <dig> regulatory gene targets in the embryonal carcinoma cell line, ntera <dig>  and the breast cancer cell line mcf <dig>  <cit> . this work supported a developmental role for znf <dig> as a regulatory factor at differentiation-specific genes. findings from this work led to the discovery that znf <dig> directly activates erbb <dig> and downstream signaling events through pi3k and mapk pathways  <cit> . despite increasing knowledge of znf217-induced phenotypes and regulation of pathways promoting tumorigenesis, there is a lack of understanding of the downstream znf217-induced effectors driving these cell pathways.

znf <dig> encodes a transcription factor with eight c2h <dig> zinc finger motifs and a proline-rich transactivation domain at the c-terminus  <cit> . znf <dig> has been reported to physically interact with ctbp1/ <dig>  <cit> , an adaptor protein found in multiple regulatory complexes at both activated and repressed gene targets  <cit> . chip-chip studies indicate ctbp and znf <dig> are co-bound at the majority of znf <dig> dna binding sites  <cit> . znf <dig> biochemically purifies with histone deacetylases hdac1/ <dig>  <cit> , histone demethylases lsd <dig>  <cit>  and jarid1b/plu- <dig>  <cit> , and histone methyltranferases g9a and ezh <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a range of regulatory functions in histone modifying complexes. based on our current knowledge of znf <dig> and its association with dna regulatory proteins, it has been hypothesized that znf <dig> functions as an organizer of histone chromatin modifiers  <cit> . the cooperating transcriptional mechanisms used by znf <dig>  and its association with specific regulatory elements remains unexplored.

an important step in understanding the molecular role of znf <dig> in breast cancer is to gain a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of genome-wide gene regulation by znf <dig> in breast cancer cells, including the involvement of cooperating transcriptional partners. in the current study we employed an integrative genomics approach to uncover the mechanisms of znf <dig> target gene regulation in breast cancer cells. using a combination of rna- and chip-seq techniques in mcf <dig> breast cancer cells, we focused on identifying genes that were regulated by znf <dig> dna binding. our findings suggest a functional association for znf <dig> with estrogen receptor alpha  at co-bound erα gene targets. this work supports further exploration into the connection between znf <dig> expression levels in breast tumors with clinical outcome and, importantly, whether znf <dig> plays a transcriptional role in aberrant erα signaling, contributing to breast cancer and therapy resistance.

RESULTS
znf <dig> genome-wide binding patterns
to elucidate the regulatory function of znf <dig> in breast cancer, we performed genome-wide chromatin mapping of znf <dig> by chip-seq using the er+ her2- mcf <dig> cell line. accordingly, we sequenced two independent chip-seq replicates and determined a set of enriched znf <dig> binding sites, using the sole-search peak calling tool  <cit> , by taking the shared znf <dig> binding sites  <  <dig> ) from both replicates . these datasets agree with the encode guidelines for transcription chip-seq overlap rules  <cit> . to determine the refseq genes nearest to each znf <dig> binding site, we used the sole-search location analysis tool. this analysis identified znf <dig> chip-seq targets at a total of  <dig>  target genes with multiple binding events occurring at  <dig>  genes . our earlier work from mcf <dig> chip-chip promoter arrays identified znf <dig> binding at the proximal promoter regions of  <dig>  genes  <cit> ; 45% of these genes are present in the current znf <dig> chip-seq dataset. analysis of distances between znf217-associated regions and the nearest annotated tsss revealed that znf <dig> binds predominantly distal to promoter regions; less than 10% of the sites are located within 1 kb of annotated tsss. in contrast, 15%, 52%, and 26% of the sites are located within 1–10 kb, 10–100 kb, and > 100 kb from a tss, respectively . interestingly, location analysis shows  <dig>  binding sites  are located within genes , with the majority  within introns. a panel of znf217-bound sites located at distal regions, including intronic sites, was confirmed by chip qpcr . znf <dig> binding at the proximal region of tff <dig> and the previously identified znf <dig> regulatory target, erbb3
 <cit> , are also shown.figure  <dig>

to further explore znf <dig> binding with respect to specific regulatory elements , we analyzed the chip-seq read density relative to the total number of znf <dig> binding sites in mcf <dig> using chip-seq datasets for a number of activating histone marks including mono- and trimethylation of histone h <dig> lys <dig>  acetyl histone h <dig> lys <dig> , as well as the repressive histone marks trimethylation of histone h <dig> lys <dig> and trimethylation of histone h <dig> at lys <dig> . the heatmap in figure 1b shows a strong enrichment for h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> relative to the center of the majority of znf <dig> sites . a small proportion of sites are also enriched for h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> . location analysis on these znf <dig> binding sites indicate that the cluster ii binding sites are largely distal regions, whereas the h3k4me <dig> enriched cluster i sites are largely promoter proximal . these results show that the majority of znf <dig> binding sites are marked by active chromatin marks and that the predominant class of binding events is located at distal regulatory elements associated with h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac. recent reports demonstrated that active enhancer elements are marked by the histone acetyltransferase p <dig> and by enrichment of h3k4me <dig> at flanking nucleosomes  <cit> . indeed, using p <dig> chip-seq data we observe p <dig> enrichment at znf <dig> peaks and h3k4me <dig> flanked znf217-bound regions, whereas h3k27me <dig> showed no substantial enrichment .

to glean insight into the function of znf <dig> binding, we performed functional annotation of the top  <dig>  znf217-bound regions with great, a software tool designed to assign biological function to noncoding genomic regions  <cit> . this analysis showed an association with ontological categories including mesoderm development, mammary gland development and gastrulation. the pathway commons category terms aligned with erα signaling and foxa <dig> transcription networks. znf <dig> binding sites associated with multiple genes in tgfβ, wnt, and er signaling pathways .

znf <dig> binding sites are occupied by multiple transcription factors
another property of enhancer regions is their relative abundance of binding sites for multiple transcription factors  <cit> . to gain insight into the function of znf <dig> at distal regulatory regions in relation to other transcriptional partners, we identified the predominant motifs for known transcription factors near znf <dig> binding sites. we retrieved the 200 bp dna sequence for the znf217-bound regions and identified the most significant motif logos using homer  <cit>  . our search identified enriched cis-regulatory sequences for foxa <dig> in 31%, gata <dig> in 34%, and eres at 20% of the znf <dig> binding sites  of which the density of each motif is enriched ± 200 bp relative to the center of the znf <dig> binding peak . next, we searched for de novo motifs over-represented within znf217-bound regions. we did not find enrichment of the znf <dig> consensus sequences reported in our earlier work  <cit> , or the work of others  <cit> . we did however identify a unique, non-repetitive sequence at znf <dig> sites: 5’-tgatca-3’ tgatca-3’). this de novo znf <dig> consensus site indicates enrichment of a sequence similar to the ap- <dig> motif . ap- <dig> motifs are very often found near binding sites for many types of tfs, including erα, and ap- <dig> has been considered by some as a “general” enhancer binding factor  <cit> . ap- <dig> is a transcription factor that interacts with erα and plays a role in the recruitment of erα upon ligand binding to specific regulatory elements within the genome . to further investigate the transcriptional partners of znf <dig>  we performed unsupervised clustering analysis of all encode chip-seq transcription factor binding sites found in mcf <dig> cells. we found a group of five transcription factors with binding sites that cluster with znf <dig> binding sites, including tcf7l <dig>  nr2f <dig>  erα, gata <dig>  and foxa <dig> . this occupancy and motif analysis highlights a significant interaction between znf <dig> and alternative breast cancer transcription regulators.figure  <dig>

several proteins serve as pioneer factors contributing to erα action in breast cancer, including foxa <dig> and gata <dig> . we therefore assessed the four-way overlap between these factors. binding site overlap analysis indicate a large fraction of the total znf <dig> binding sites are shared by erα, gata <dig>  and foxa <dig> in asynchronous mcf <dig> cells . in addition, this analysis reveals distinct combinations of binding sites shared between these factors. we found that while 41% of znf <dig> sites overlap with erα , there are other unique associations of znf <dig> with gata <dig> and foxa <dig> independent of erα in mcf <dig> cells . the individual sets of genes bound by znf <dig> and each factor or groups of factors are listed in additional file  <dig>  heatmap clustering of the read density from independent erα, foxa <dig>  and gata <dig> chip-seq experiments supports the association of these transcriptional regulators, where an enriched signal is prevalent surrounding the center of znf <dig> binding sites . one example of overlap between znf <dig> with erα, foxa <dig>  and gata <dig> co-bound regions is shown at the tff <dig> gene, a well-known er gene target  <cit>  .figure  <dig>

depletion of znf <dig> identifies a gene expression signature associated with erα gene targets
to gain further insight into the regulation of gene expression by znf <dig>  we employed an rna-seq approach following znf <dig> silencing to characterize the direct and indirect targets of znf <dig> in mcf <dig> breast cancer cells. we treated cells with znf217-targeting short interfering rna  leading to znf <dig> mrna and protein depletion  and performed gene expression profiling by rna-seq. we identified  <dig>  differentially expressed genes;  <dig>  genes were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated genes in the znf <dig> knockdown sample, as compared to the control  sirna-treated sample  <  <dig> ; genes listed in additional file 10; figure 4a). rna-seq results were confirmed by rt-qpcr on a small panel of genes . to determine if the genes that changed with znf <dig> silencing are also bound by znf <dig>  we integrated the chip-seq and rna-seq datasets and compared the expression of genes with a znf <dig> binding site. among the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes, following znf <dig> silencing,  <dig>   of the znf217-bound genes change with znf <dig> knockdown. in addition, we find that 62% and 38% of the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes with a znf <dig> binding site show increased and decreased expression, respectively . we also found that among a total  <dig>  genes co-bound by znf <dig> and erα,  <dig> genes change in expression with znf <dig> silencing of which 60%  show increased expression levels . independent rt-qpcr experiments validate the increased levels of the known estrogen responsive erα-target genes lrig <dig>  <cit>  and slc22a <dig>  <cit>  and the decreased levels of axin <dig> and igfbp <dig> following znf <dig> depletion .figure  <dig>

the znf <dig> gene signature identifies gene set enrichments from er+ breast cancer studies
to understand the genes regulated by znf <dig> and the pathways associated with erα function, we performed gene ontology analysis on the lists of differentially regulated genes following znf <dig> silencing with the great classification gene ontology tool  <cit> . interestingly, both the list of  <dig>  znf217-bound differentially regulated genes and the list of  <dig> znf217-erα co-bound differentially regulated genes show strong associations with genes associated with multiple cancer studies present in the molecular signatures database   <cit> . genes in the znf217-erα co-bound list correlate with genes identified from key cancer studies including:  genes found up-regulated or down-regulated in breast cancer tumors  resistant to tamoxifen ,  genes up-regulated in luminal-like breast cancer cell lines compared to basal or mesenchymal-like ones ,  genes associated with acquired endocrine therapy resistance in breast tumors expressing esr <dig> but not erbb <dig> ,  down-regulated genes in the cancer progenitor  cells corresponding to side population  mcf <dig> cells positive for muc <dig> ,  genes up-regulated in mcf- <dig> cells under hypoxia and ,  genes that change according to the esr <dig> status: er positive vs er negative tumor , and  genes up-regulated in mcf <dig> cells  after stimulation with nrg <dig> . the enrichments of the znf217-erα co-bound msigdb categories are shown in figure  <dig>  a comparison of the complete list of cancer studies associated with znf217-bound and znf217-erα co-bound genes are in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

we were particularly interested in the combined up- and down-regulated znf <dig> differentially expressed genes  associated with the massarweh expression study  <cit> . gene ontology for the  <dig> genes showed functional classification associating with developmental pathways; many of these genes are known estrogen-responsive erα target genes . the gene expression changes found in tamoxifen-resistant tumors  included several genes either up or down-regulated by znf <dig> and co-bound by znf217- erα including cav <dig>  elf <dig>  id <dig>  tgfb <dig>  lrig <dig>  foxo <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cd <dig> 

znf <dig> and erα precipitate in mcf <dig> nuclear extracts
our genome-wide binding analysis indicates znf <dig> is associated with erα and other regulatory factors at “active” dna regulatory elements. it is well-known that nuclear receptors do not function in isolation but require co-factors to assist with dna interaction; intensive work in the field of estrogen receptor biology has sought to identify critical factors that affect erα-mediated transcription  <cit> . to identify potential unknown regulators of erα, jason carroll’s group performed a novel approach termed rime . this work identified an association between erα and  <dig> proteins, including the association of znf <dig> and the binding partners, ctbp1/ <dig>  in three out of three replicate experiments  <cit> . to confirm this finding, we tested whether or not znf <dig> associates with erα in mcf <dig> nuclear extracts by co-immunoprecipitation assays. immunoblotting of lysates showed erα precipitated both znf <dig> and the znf217-binding partner ctbp <dig> .

znf <dig> is enriched in er+ breast cancer
if znf <dig> interacts with erα and potentially contributes to the chromatin landscape associated with erα binding, then we reasoned that znf <dig> expression might be higher in estrogen receptor positive  tumors. using microarray expression studies of breast tumors across multiple patient cohorts, we found that znf <dig> expression levels are higher in er+ tumors than in er- tumors . we next compared znf <dig> expression levels across patient subtypes: luminal a, luminal b, erbb2+, basal, and normal. patient data from the chin and hess studies indicate znf <dig> expression is consistently highest in luminal and lowest in basal subtype tumors .figure  <dig>

we previously found that high znf <dig> expression is a prognostic indicator in general as well as in er+her2+ln− patients with breast cancer correlating with shorter overall, disease-specific, and relapse-free survival  <cit> . we next wanted to determine if znf <dig> overexpression had prognostic value exclusive of estrogen receptor status. we found that high znf <dig> expression consistently predicted poor prognosis across multiple tumor subtypes: luminal, er−, her2+/erbb2+, and basal cohorts . together, our data show that znf <dig> is prognostic of reduced survival in er+, er−, her2+/erbb2+, luminal, and basal subtype patients by univariate analysis. moreover, znf <dig> was a better predictor of survival than erα status but not tumor size by multivariate analysis  <cit> .

we also looked for a correlation between znf <dig> and erα protein expression in breast tumor samples. we screened a small sample size of  <dig> tumor lysates and immunoblotted for znf <dig> and erα. densitometry indicated a high correlation for znf <dig> and erα protein expression  in the tumor samples .

znf <dig> expression is prognostic of reduced survival in patients with er+ and luminal a breast tumors
to further explore the effect of znf <dig> expression on patient survival we interrogated the kaplan meier-plotter, an online survival analysis tool, for overall survival in breast cancer patients to rapidly assess the effect of  <dig>  genes on breast cancer prognosis using microarray data of  <dig>  patients  <cit> . we compared all er+ patients  and found that high znf <dig> expression was associated with lower overall survival . to determine whether znf <dig> was simply identifying the poorer prognosis luminal b tumors from within the luminal cohort, we asked whether znf <dig> expression had prognostic value in the er+ luminal a tumors or the er+ luminal b tumors . as shown in figure 7b, high znf <dig> expression is associated with lower overall survival in the luminal a tumors . interestingly, the data for luminal b tumors expressing high znf <dig> did not reach statistical significance . this finding suggests that znf <dig> provides additional prognostic information, beyond erα status and luminal subtype.figure  <dig>

and luminal a breast tumors. znf <dig> gene expression was analyzed using the kaplan meier-plotter, an online survival analysis tool to analyze gene expression with breast cancer prognosis using microarray data from  <dig>  patients  <cit> . high znf <dig> expression affects overall survival in luminal a but not luminal b er+ breast cancer patients . the prognostic value of high znf <dig> expression  was compared to the patient cohort with low znf <dig> expression in  all er+ patients , p =  <dig> .  luminal a , p =  <dig>   luminal b , p =  <dig> .  high znf <dig> correlates with worse survival in er+ patients treated with any endocrine therapy . the prognostic value of high znf <dig>  expression  was compared to the patient cohort with low znf <dig> expression , p =  <dig> .



znf <dig> expression is prognostic of reduced survival after hormone treatment of er+ breast cancer patients
the high overlap between differentially regulated genes co-bound by znf <dig> and erα and the poor prognosis of patients with breast tumors that overexpress znf <dig> suggested that znf <dig> may have a regulatory role in expression changes that occur in tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors. to determine if high znf <dig> expression correlates with reduced overall survival in the cohort of er+ patients that received anti-hormone therapy only , we explored n =  <dig> patients with high versus n =  <dig> low znf <dig> expression in the kaplan meier-plotter . patients with high znf <dig> expression  demonstrated worse outcome p =  <dig> .

discussion
in this work we have mapped the chromatin landscape surrounding znf <dig> dna binding sites and found significant overlap between znf <dig> binding and transcription factors associated with the erα regulatory network. znf <dig> predominantly occupies distal regulatory regions marked by the active histone marks h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> and, depending on the chromosomal context, may participate either in the repression or the activation of gene expression. a similar mode of action for er-mediated gene regulation has been proposed where erα associates with auxiliary tfs and co-regulators in a specific chromosomal context to control gene expression, although it is not well understood what specifies the context-dependent activity of this regulation. in support of a transcriptional role for znf <dig> in aberrant erα signaling, we identified a znf217-erα gene signature with ontological classification that aligns with multiple breast cancer studies . data-mining of expression data from breast cancer patients also associates high znf <dig> expression with poor prognosis across multiple intrinsic subtypes and reduced response to hormone therapy .

the function of er binding at chromatin regions and transcriptional regulation is strongly influenced by gata <dig> and foxa <dig> . gata <dig> appears to function as a critical regulator of transcription factor binding, chromatin structure, and long-range genomic communication  <cit> . foxa <dig> is known as a pioneer factor, a special class of transcription factors that bind to condensed chromatin and facilitate the binding of additional transcription factors  <cit> . an elegant study by ross-innes et al., mapped the genome-wide er-binding events by chip-seq in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcomes  <cit> . they found distinct er binding co-factor combinations linked with the different clinical outcomes, and that foxa <dig> appears to mediate the differential er-binding profiles found in clinical subtypes. however it is still unknown what dictates the differential foxa <dig> and subsequent erα binding. at the genome level approximately a quarter of all erα -binding events are co-occupied by gata <dig> and foxa <dig>  <cit> . similarly, we found an enrichment of gata <dig> and foxa <dig> factors at znf217-bound regions . our results suggest znf217-bound regions may be co-occupied with erα and foxa <dig> at multiple erα gene targets, including tff <dig>  erbb <dig>  slc22a <dig>  and lrig <dig> . knockdown of znf <dig> followed by expression profiling identified  <dig>  differentially affected genes suggesting a functional regulatory role linked to multiple signaling pathways associated with breast cancer . future work will determine whether znf <dig> binding to erα cis-regulatory sequences contributes an additional level of regulation to erα-binding potential and erα-signaling. multiple regulatory scenarios are possible and include znf <dig> promotion of chromatin accessibility through recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors or regulation of three-dimensional chromatin to spatially connect distal enhancer regions with proximal promoters. it will be interesting to unravel the potential regulatory role for znf <dig> signaling and whether znf <dig> co-operates or competes with erα regulatory factors such as gata <dig> and foxa <dig> 

interestingly, znf <dig> and gata3-foxa <dig> are associated with opposite tumor phenotypes. well-differentiated tumors are generally less advanced and support a better prognosis than poorly differentiated tumors that are more aggressive and correlate with poorer prognosis. the regulation of cell differentiation during normal development involves transcription factors that are increasingly associated with tumorigenesis upon their aberrant re-activation and expression. recently, gata <dig> has been shown to play an important role at multiple stages of mammary gland development, including the formation of terminal end buds in luminal cell differentiation  <cit> . gata <dig> is a strong predictor of tumor grade, er status, well-differentiated tumors, and a marker of good prognosis. loss of gata <dig> coincides with loss of differentiation and tumor metastasis  <cit> . similar to gata <dig>  foxa <dig> plays a role in postnatal development of the mammary gland, perhaps due to its requirement for erα chromatin binding and activity  <cit> . both gata <dig> and foxa <dig> expression are part of the luminal a molecular subtype gene signature  <cit> , associated with well-differentiated tumors and better prognosis. tumors negative for gata <dig> and foxa <dig> expression associate with poorly differentiated tumors and malignant progression  <cit> .

in contrast to gata <dig> and foxa <dig>  the znf <dig> gene is amplified at 20q <dig> in ~20% of breast tumors and is associated with aggressive breast disease  <cit> . our recent studies show the overexpression of znf <dig> promotes cell plasticity particularly in the maintenance of the de-differentiated stem-like cell state, and accelerates tumor progression and metastasis  <cit> . our findings that znf <dig> interacts physically with erα and that znf <dig> occupies chromatin regions also occupied by erα, gata <dig>  and foxa <dig> will require further investigation to understand whether znf <dig> is one of the multiple factors that contribute to erα chromatin binding and erα gene regulation.

data-mining of microarray expression data from primary breast tumors and the corresponding clinical data showed high znf <dig> expression correlates with shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival  <cit> . our current studies demonstrate a high correlation between znf <dig> and erα expression in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor tissue, yet the precise role of znf <dig> in er+ breast cancer is not fully understood. studies conducted over 10 years ago using microarray technology revealed tumor heterogeneity at the gene expression level and led to the identification of breast cancer subtypes  <cit> . the er+ subtypes, referred to as luminal a and luminal b, have different gene-expression profiles, prognosis and treatment responses . when compared to the luminal a subtype, luminal b tumors often have lower expression levels of erα or er-regulated genes, higher tumor grade, activation of growth factor receptor signaling pathways and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy than luminal a tumors  <cit> . despite the divisions between luminal a and b subtypes, the heterogeneity found in er+/−and luminal tumors suggests further stratification is necessary to enable more accurate prognosis and treatment plan for individual patients
 <cit> . our findings suggest that znf <dig> overexpression in er+, luminal a, or other subtypes of breast cancer will identify a subset of patients with worse prognosis who will benefit from more aggressive or alternative therapy. the identification of the znf217-er gene signature aligning with multiple breast cancer studies further supports a transcriptional role for znf <dig> in aberrant erα signaling . future investigations will explore the connection between znf <dig> expression levels in breast tumors with clinical outcome and, importantly, whether znf <dig> plays a transcriptional role in aberrant erα signaling, contributing to breast cancer and therapy resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in this genome-wide study we show the distribution of znf <dig> binding events coincide with gata <dig>  foxa <dig>  and erα binding. motif analysis and co-immunoprecipitation assays implicate znf <dig> in a co-regulatory role with erα at co-bound regions. the understanding of the chromatin landscape at znf217-bound regions is beginning to provide insight into a relationship between znf <dig> and erα to modulate enhancer accessibility, erα-binding potential, and gene regulation. additional studies are underway to explore the requirement of znf <dig> in erα gene regulation at co-bound sites prior to estrogen stimulation. our findings contribute to the genome-wide potential of znf <dig> in the hierarchy of erα-mediated regulation by multiple transcription factors and provide a possible mechanism by which znf <dig> contributes to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.
