BACKGROUND
arabidopsis thaliana is a wild, annual, self-fertilizing plant with a broad geographic range as a native species in the eurasian continent  <cit> . in the past decade, this species has become the main model plant, not only for molecular biology studies  <cit>  but also for addressing the ecological and evolutionary bases of plant adaptation  <cit> . deciphering the genetic structure of a. thaliana diversity across its geographic range is now a major aim because it explains its current ecological distribution, it reflects its demographic history, and it enables the precise design and analysis of experimental populations used to determine the molecular mechanisms of adaptive traits  <cit> .

currently, more than  <dig> wild genotypes  of a. thaliana from different world regions have been collected. studies of the genetic diversity and structure, at global  and regional scales, have proposed several major events in a. thaliana demographic history in europe  <cit> . in particular, high diversity has been described in the mediterranean peninsulas compared to central and northern europe, hence supporting the existence of multiple pleistocene glacial refugia in southern europe  <cit> . further haplotype network analyses have led to the tentative suggestion of the caucasus region as the ancestral a. thaliana centre of origin  <cit> . however, the largest diversity has been found in the iberian peninsula, whose strong geographic structure has prompted the hypothesis of multiple iberian glacial refugia with differential contribution to the colonization of europe  <cit> . various global genetic analyses have identified two main postglacial colonization routes of europe, from at least two refugia  <cit> . a glacial refugium in the iberian peninsula has been proposed to contribute to a west–east colonization of western and northern europe, while an asian refugium was likely the source for an east–west colonization of eastern and northern europe. in agreement with this view, genetic structure analyses of northern european populations have detected several differentiated clusters, which support multiple sources of postglacial colonization  <cit> . in addition, a few studies have addressed a. thaliana history in east asia and in regions outside the eurasian continent. nuclear and chloroplast analyses of a. thaliana populations from china have also shown substantial genetic variation and geographic structure, hence suggesting a rapid a. thaliana west–east expansion from central asia  <cit> . moreover, genetic studies of north american and japanese populations have detected no or weak geographic patterns, which indicate a very recent colonization from multiple sources  <cit> .

despite the unique resources available for a. thaliana, the scarcity of accessions from many regions located outside of europe has hampered our knowledge of its demographic history in africa and asia. for instance, the centre of origin of a. thaliana is still unknown, since conclusive evidence for one of the two classical hypothetical locations, europe-north africa and middle asia, requires further samples and studies from those regions  <cit> . in particular, north africa  is the extreme southern limit of a. thaliana distribution in the mediterranean basin, and it is assumed to be part of the native range  <cit> . however, the history of a. thaliana in this region remains virtually ignored since less than a handful of african accessions have been studied until now  <cit> .

the relevance of northern africa in structuring biodiversity, at global and regional scales, has been well documented for several plant species . this is determined mainly by the unique biogeographic location of this region, which is part of one of the world’s largest biodiversity hotspot, the mediterrranean basin, and it contains migration routes from europe, africa and asia  <cit> . a small number of phylogeographical and palaeoecological studies have identified several pleistocene glacial refugia for perennial and annual plants in the african side of the mediterranean basin  <cit> . in addition, the central-marginal hypothesis for the geographic distribution of diversity across species’ ranges predicts lower genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation in peripheral than central populations . however, most studies supporting these expectations, including those of a. thaliana, have focused in the northern limit of species from the north hemisphere  <cit> . therefore, additional studies estimating the genetic diversity and structure of plant species, especially herb plants, in southern limits like north africa are needed to evaluate current hypotheses explaining plant evolutionary histories and their actual geographic distributions.

in this study we have addressed the genetic diversity and structure of a. thaliana in north africa by developing a new collection of accessions derived from populations distributed throughout the species range in morocco. in particular, we aim to determine, first, if north africa has been recently colonized, or if it might contain genetically isolated and structured populations supporting the occurrence of a. thaliana as a native species. second, we aim to detect genetic relationships between morocco and other geographic regions, which might provide information about the demographic history in north africa. to approach these questions, we have analysed this moroccan collection together with a collection from the nearest european region, the iberian peninsula, and a worldwide collection. population genetic analyses of genome-wide neutral markers and potentially adaptive flowering genes and traits, demonstrate a shared history in southern europe and northern africa. together, these analyses identified the strait of gibraltar as a migration route between europe and africa, and suggest that the atlas area was a pleistocene glacial refugium for a. thaliana.

RESULTS
genetic diversity and structure in north africa
to determine the genetic diversity of a. thaliana in north africa we sampled  <dig> individuals in  <dig> populations distributed across the major mountain ranges of morocco . genotyping of this collection with a genome-wide set of  <dig> presumably neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms  detected a total of  <dig> different haplotypes. no haplotype was shared by several populations. moreover, substantial variation was found among populations for the number of haplotypes per population, because two populations carried a single haplotype while two others contained seven or more genotypes . similar variation was detected for gene diversity  and allelic richness  per population, which showed up to a tenfold range of variation among populations. the amount of genetic variation per population displayed a weak geographic pattern since the percentage of polymorphic loci  correlated negatively with latitude , and r
s
 showed similar negative but marginal correlation . in agreement, four geographic subregions established according to latitude differed slightly for pl, r

the genetic relationship among moroccan populations was first analysed by constructing neighbor-joining  trees of the  <dig> haplotypes , which showed that genotypes are genetically closer within than among populations. amova analyses indicated that populations were highly differentiated, with  <dig> % of the genetic variation appearing distributed among populations  and only  <dig> % occurring within populations . mantel tests of pair-wise geographic distances and genetic distances, measured as f
st
 or as percentage of allele differences among populations, detected highly significant correlations  accounting for up to 67% of the variance. therefore, a. thaliana genetic variation showed a continuous isolation by distance  geographic pattern across morocco.

to further determine the genetic structure of a. thaliana in morocco we analysed the different haplotypes using two clustering approaches, structure and principal component  analyses. structure analysis detected four major clusters that closely corresponded to the four geographic subregions . clustering analyses using the first three principal components, which explained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genetic variation, identified precisely the same four groups . these genetic groups were also supported by nj analyses since the four main nj clades corresponded to such clusters . amova analyses indicated that  <dig> % of the genetic variation differentiates the four groups, whereas  <dig> % differentiates populations within groups. thus, a. thaliana genetic variation for neutral markers appears strongly geographically structured in morocco.

genetic diversity and structure in the south-western mediterranean region
to establish the genetic relationships among a. thaliana populations in the south-western mediterranean range, we analysed the  <dig> moroccan populations together with a set of  <dig> previously sampled iberian populations  <cit> . genotyping of a single random individual from each population with the same genome-wide set of snps showed that all  <dig> samples were different genotypes. gene diversity and allelic richness values indicated that a. thaliana diversity in morocco was considerably lower than in the iberian peninsula . mantel tests of correlations between geographic and genetic distances detected significantly higher correlation coefficients and slopes of linear regressions in morocco than in iberia . however, the difference between these slopes was mainly determined by the larger genetic distances between geographically closer populations of iberia. therefore, the apparently stronger ibd pattern detected in morocco might reflect higher iberian diversity or a more complex iberian geographic structure at lower spatial scales.

the genetic structure in this region was further analysed with structure and pca clustering methods. structure analyses detected four different genetic groups showing distinct geographic distribution . clusters were numbered as described in a previous study with a lower number of populations and snps  <cit> , groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> appearing distributed mainly in nw, ne and sw of the iberian peninsula. by contrast, group  <dig> displayed a broader geographic distribution because it included  <dig> iberian accessions scattered throughout this region, as well as all moroccan genotypes. the first three principal components detected by pca accounted for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genetic variation. clustering analyses of these three components identified very similar groups to structure  since 92% of the accessions were assigned to the same group based on the major cluster membership of each accession . amova analyses showed an average f

diversity and differentiation for flowering genes, traits and climatic variables in the south-western mediterranean region
the genetic diversity of a. thaliana in the south-western mediterranean range was also analysed for the nucleotide variation of four well-known flowering genes that are likely involved in adaptation . overall, flowering genes showed larger diversity in iberia than morocco as estimated by the private allelic richness . genes showed similar nucleotide diversity patterns in morocco and iberia, with fri and flc displaying low silent diversities and cry <dig> and phyc high values . however, analyses of the major known functional polymorphisms for these genes showed a lower frequency of predicted fri loss-of-function mutations in moroccan than iberian accessions. in addition, as previously reported in iberia, only one of the two major european haplogroups described in flc was detected in morocco . furthermore, the two major european haplogroups of cry <dig> and phyc were also found in morocco at similar low frequencies to the iberian peninsula . interestingly, a new cry <dig> haplogroup named as cry2-c, differentiated by three aminoacid substitutions, was found at high frequency in morocco . this cry <dig> haplogroup appeared at very low frequency in iberia  and explained the larger moroccan cry <dig> variation. therefore, a. thaliana populations from morocco showed a similar amount and pattern of diversity to the iberian peninsula for flc and phyc. however, moroccan populations displayed higher and lower amounts of potentially functional diversity at cry <dig> and fri, respectively.

4: accessions are classified as functional and loss-of-function truncations for fri <cit>  or as the two major functional haplogroups described for flc, cry <dig> and phyc <cit> . frequencies are given for truncations and for the minor frequency haplogroups.

the genetic relationships between morocco and each of the four iberian genetic groups detected with neutral markers were also analysed using flowering gene sequences. gene diversity and allelic richness of moroccan populations were most similar to those of iberian genetic group  <dig>  although moroccan diversities were mostly higher . in addition, in contrast to morocco, iberian group  <dig> was not segregating for fri loss-of-function alleles and for the major cry <dig> haplogroups . pair-wise analyses of f
st
 values between morocco and the four iberian genetic groups showed that group  <dig> displays the lowest genetic differentiation from moroccan populations for most genes . hence, a. thaliana populations from morocco appeared also most similar to iberian genetic group  <dig> for flowering genes.

the genetic differentiation between morocco and the iberian peninsula was further analysed by measuring three quantitative traits related with flowering induction: vernalization requirement, flowering time and leaf number . four of the  <dig> moroccan accessions  showed an obligate vernalization requirement because they did not flower at all without a low temperature treatment but they flowered after two months at 4°c. this proportion was not significantly different from the 12% frequency observed in iberia. however, the range of variation among moroccan accessions for flowering time  and leaf number  was significantly smaller than the iberian variation  . in particular, no moroccan accession showed an extreme early flowering behaviour, in comparison with 17% of iberian samples flowering in less than  <dig> days and with fewer than  <dig> leaves. comparisons of flowering traits between morocco and the four iberian genetic groups showed that moroccan accessions were most similar to iberian group  <dig>  although differences were only significantly different between morocco and genetic group  <dig> . in agreement, the genetic differentiation between morocco and the rest of groups estimated by pair-wise q
st
 values of flowering traits, varied between  <dig> for groups  <dig> or  <dig>  and  <dig>  for group  <dig> .

since a. thaliana flowering variation has been involved in climatic adaptation  <cit>  we analyzed if the similarities observed between morocco and iberia for flowering traits and genes might be determined by the climatic environment of local populations. comparisons of climatic variables showed that, on average, moroccan populations are exposed to higher mean annual temperature  and lower annual precipitation than iberian populations . further comparisons of climatic variables between morocco and the four iberian genetic groups showed that the climatic distribution of moroccan populations was most similar to that of iberian genetic group  <dig> distributed in south-western iberia . both, moroccan populations and iberian genetic group  <dig>  appeared significantly associated with high temperatures and low summer precipitation. therefore, the genetic similarity between morocco and iberia for flowering genes and traits do not seem to reflect shared adaptations to a similar climatic environment.

genetic diversity and structure at a global scale
a. thaliana genetic relationships between the south-western mediterranean region and the rest of world was also studied by analyzing the  <dig> moroccan and iberian accessions together with  <dig> genotypes representing populations from eleven additional world regions . genotyping of these  <dig> accessions with the  <dig> segregating snps showed that morocco and the iberian peninsula contained the lowest and highest a. thaliana diversity, respectively .

analysis of the genetic structure of this a. thaliana worldwide collection using structure detected six different clusters with distinct geographic patterns . pca analysis of the same genotypes found that the first five principal components accounted for  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the genetic variation. the subsequent clustering of these components detected similar genetic clusters to structure  since 80% of the accessions were assigned to equivalent genetic groups . four of the genetic groups closely corresponded to the iberian clusters identified in the previous analysis of the south-western mediterranean region . however, two additional clusters  were detected as distributed mainly in eastern europe, asia and africa. groups  <dig> and  <dig> showed the widest geographic distributions in eurasia. analysis of the average regional proportions of these groups  showed that group  <dig> displays the highest frequency in iberia and british isles, and its eurasian frequency decreases in a west–east direction. by contrast, group  <dig> displayed high frequency in central, north and east europe but it was nearly absent in iberia and morocco. groups  <dig> and  <dig> showed an intermediate distribution, with group  <dig> appearing mainly in asia and north africa, while group  <dig> showed moderate frequency in asia and east europe. groups  <dig> and  <dig> displayed restricted geographic distributions since group  <dig> was present almost exclusively in north africa and iberia, and group  <dig> mostly in the iberian peninsula.

f
st
 analyses among the six genetic groups rendered an average genetic differentiation of  <dig> , but again group  <dig> displayed the largest differentiations from the rest of clusters  and the lowest genetic diversity . in agreement, group  <dig> was also the first cluster differentiated in the k =  <dig> analysis of structure, and an identical cluster was detected in subsequent analyses from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  this group contained the same  <dig> iberian accessions and all  <dig> moroccan accessions assigned to group  <dig> in the previous mediterranean analysis. however, three and  <dig> moroccan accessions were assigned to an asian group in structure analyses with k =  <dig> and k =  <dig>  respectively. thus, global analyses suggest that moroccan populations of a. thaliana are closely related to those from iberia but also weakly related to asian populations.

discussion
low genetic diversity and strong geographic structure in morocco reflect a homogeneous native history of a. thaliana in north africa
in this study we have systematically sampled and analysed a. thaliana populations across morocco, the southern mediterranean limit of the species range. populations were typically found at altitudes between  <dig> and 2000 m.a.s.l. in the high atlas, middle atlas and riff mountains where natural vegetation still predominates . this region contained less genetic variation than other world regions, for neutral markers, flowering genes and potentially adaptive quantitative traits. in particular, no extreme early flowering accession was found in morocco, which was in agreement with the association of such flowering behavior with low altitude  <cit> . the amount of variation detected within moroccan local populations was lower than that described for southern european peninsulas proposed as mediterranean glacial refugia  <cit> . instead, the average intrapopulation variation of morocco was similar to that estimated in scandinavia, the northern limit of the native range reached after postglacial colonization  <cit> , or in japan, a non-native region recently colonized  <cit> .

the strong a. thaliana geographic structure found in morocco at different spatial scales supports an old history as part of the native range. first, populations appeared highly differentiated, the average f
st
 value of  <dig>  estimated among moroccan populations being similar to that reported in the northern limit of the species native range  <cit> . second, in contrast to recently colonized regions such as japan and north america  <cit>  the strong pattern of isolation by distance across morocco indicates limited geographic seed dispersal from local populations throughout morocco. however, discrete genetic groups that are geographically structured were also detected consistently by different clustering methods. this indicates the presence of some spatial discontinuities in morocco ibd pattern, which are likely caused by geographical  barriers that further limit a. thaliana dispersal and contribute to subregional differentiation in morocco. it must be emphasized that the detection of these clusters is not the result of uneven geographic sampling, as illustrated by the assignment of two populations from the south middle atlas subregion, to the genetic cluster of the high atlas populations . in agreement with the central-marginal hypothesis for the geographic distribution of diversity across species’ ranges  <cit>  morocco region appears as a trailing edge of a. thaliana’s native range characterized by little recent admixture and genetically isolated and differentiated populations. this pattern of variation is likely to be determined not only by contemporary local adaptation of populations to patches of suitable habitat that are close to the species environmental tolerance limits, but also, as discussed below, by abiotic or biotic factors that affected the demographic history of a. thaliana in the past  <cit> .

a moroccan/iberian specific genetic lineage reveals an a. thaliana history shared between south-western europe and north africa
the iberian peninsula has been proposed as a region containing several a. thaliana refugia during the last glaciation, which have played an important role in the postglacial colonization of europe  <cit> . this has been supported by the large genetic diversity of this region and the strong geographic structure reported for multiple kinds of markers and for whole-genome sequences of iberian accessions  <cit> . in agreement with previous results, our genome-wide snp analysis finds iberia as the world region containing the largest diversity, which appears structured into four genetic groups with distinct geographic distributions. several analyses consistently show that moroccan populations are genetically related mainly to one particular iberian group. first, morocco populations group with iberian genetic group  <dig> by clustering analyses of neutral snp markers. second, moroccan populations showed similar flowering behavior to group  <dig> from the iberian peninsula, which is characterized by the absence of early flowering accessions. third, similar frequencies are found in morocco and iberia for the major functional haplotypes described in europe for flowering genes. accordingly, morocco displayed the lowest differentiation from iberian genetic group  <dig> for flowering genes and traits, as estimated by f
st
 and q
st
 values. thus, we identified an a. thaliana genetic lineage with a shared demographic history in the south-western mediterranean region.

the moroccan/iberian specific distribution of this lineage provides new insights into a. thaliana history in north africa and south-western europe. on one hand, it indicates that the strait of gibraltar has been an a. thaliana migration route between the european and african continents. this is in agreement with the well-documented natural history of this region, which recognizes a biodiversity hotspot consisting of two areas with partially overlapping sets of species separated by the strait of gibraltar  <cit> . however, our results also suggest that rather limited a. thaliana genetic flow has occurred between morocco and iberia because this genetic lineage shows an isolated history from the remaining iberian genetic groups, as indicated by its low genetic diversity and its strong differentiation. in addition, the western mediterranean distribution of this lineage seems to be predominantly determined by a. thaliana demographic history rather than by adaptation to a similar climatic environment in this region. this conclusion is supported by: i) the wide geographic distribution of this group in iberia and morocco; ii) the substantial diversity of group  <dig> for some potentially adaptive haplogroups described for flowering genes such as cry <dig> and phyc; iii) the higher climatic similarity of moroccan populations with the geographic range of southern iberia occupied by genetic group  <dig> than with that occupied by genetic group  <dig> 

on the other hand, the strongly isolated and structured distribution of this genetic lineage in the western mediterranean region suggests that it was maintained as a refugium during the last glaciations. as reported for several plant and animal species  <cit> , we hypothesize that the atlas mountain range in north-western africa could have been a mediterranean glacial refugium for a. thaliana during the pleistocene. consequently, we speculate that this genetic lineage might have colonized northern morocco and southern spain during the postglacial period. latitudinal declines in genetic diversity have been associated with recent northward colonization in temperate species  <cit> . in agreement with these observations, a weak latitudinal cline of the intrapopulation genetic variation is detected in morocco, populations from the riff area containing slightly lower variation than populations from the atlas mountains. furthermore, both neutral markers and flowering genes  showed higher private allelic richness in moroccan than iberian populations assigned to this genetic lineage. interestingly, it has been described for several forest plants that colonizations from glacial refugia do not necessarily involve a gradual diversity decrease away from the source populations  <cit> . in contrast, complex genetic patterns of admixed populations can be generated by contributions from different refugia. accordingly, the hypothesis of an african atlas refugium for a. thaliana is also compatible with the large genetic diversity and complex structure found in the iberian peninsula, since additional a. thaliana refugia in this region probably accounted for its overall larger intrapopulation and regional variation. in fact, previous analyses of iberian intrapopulation variation using the same set of snps  <cit>  shows that populations gra and mar belonging to genetic group  <dig> have similar low diversities to moroccan populations reported here. nevertheless, we cannot discard that a glacial refugium of this lineage was located in central iberia, and that this was the source for the subsequent colonization of north-western africa.

genetic relationships at global scale support a potential migration route between north africa and asia
the worldwide genetic and geographic structures detected in this study are in agreement with the previously proposed postglacial colonization routes of europe during the pleistocene  <cit> . in particular, the opposite longitudinal gradients displayed by the frequencies of the two most common genetic groups  support north-western iberian and asian refugia contributing to the colonization of europe. on the contrary, the restricted geographic distribution of several genetic groups suggests that other iberian refugia, as well as the newly proposed moroccan and/or iberian refugium, did not contribute substantially to such colonization  <cit> . in addition, the genetic relationship detected between morocco and asia, further suggests a potential a. thaliana migration route connecting north-western africa and asia. accordingly, a colonization event of morocco is hypothesized to have occurred from asia through this northern african route, which could predate the latest glaciations or could have occurred later during the african humid period documented between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years bp  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the research presented here shows that a. thaliana displays low genetic diversity in morocco but the genetic variation is strongly geographically structured, hence supporting a native history in north africa. in addition, morocco appears genetically related mainly to the iberian peninsula, which indicates a shared demographic history between south-western europe and north africa. our work illustrates the relevance of systematic population genetic analyses of unknown geographic regions to infer the history of a. thaliana. further comparative studies including underrepresented regions from the rest of north africa, the middle east and central asia are needed to test the propossed historical hypotheses. in particular, it is likely that the speculated a. thaliana refugia trace back to different pleistocene dates as consequence of strong climatic fluctuations and occurrence of several species retraction/expansion episodes during this period  <cit> . eventually, model-based analyses of future whole-genome sequences  <cit>  will enable testing of alternative historical scenarios and temporal estimations of demographic events that occurred during a. thaliana’s evolutionary history.
