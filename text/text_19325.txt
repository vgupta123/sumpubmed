BACKGROUND
the pkd family is a novel family of serine/threonine kinases and diacyglycerol  receptors. three isoforms of pkd have been identified so far: pkd <dig> , pkd <dig>  and pkd <dig>   <cit> . originally classified as a member of the protein kinase c  family, the pkd family is now recognized as a subfamily of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase superfamily, and is only distantly related to pkc in structure  <cit> . all isoforms contain a catalytic domain, a cysteine-rich dag-binding domain , and a pleckstrin homology  domain that negatively regulates pkd activity  <cit> . dag regulates the localization of pkd through binding to its c <dig> domain  <cit>  and its activity through regulating pkc-dependent phosphorylation of pkd on serines  <dig> and  <dig>  in the activation loop  <cit> . rapid, early activation of pkd by pkc then leads to autophosphorylation of pkd on serine  <dig>  and subsequent full activation of pkd  <cit> . interestingly, recent evidence suggests that while ser <dig> transphosphorylation by pkc is required for early activation of pkd, ser <dig> is also a site of autophosphorylation, and that autophosphorylation at this site is required for maintaining prolonged pkd activation  <cit> .

since its discovery, pkd has been implicated in various cellular functions significant to tumor development including proliferation, survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and motility. for example, pkd activation in response to vascular endothelial-derived growth factor  or bombesin leads to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/ <dig>  regulating cell proliferation in several cell types  <cit> . pkd can also be activated by oxidative stress, which modulates cell survival through the nf-κb and jnk signaling pathways  <cit> . furthermore, pkd has been implicated in the regulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer cells by modulation of β-catenin, and angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells through modulating phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of class iia histone deacetylases   <cit> . disruption of these fundamental pathways could potentially lead to the development, progression, and metastasis of cancer. in recent studies, pkd expression has been shown to be dysregulated in human prostate cancer tissues  <cit> , implicating a role for pkd in the progression of prostate cancer. to support this, we previously reported that a knockdown of pkd <dig>  a member of the pkd family, using sirna caused a dramatic arrest in cell proliferation in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . furthermore, we also found that inhibition of pkd using the novel pkd inhibitor cid <dig> not only reduced proliferation in lncap, du <dig>  and pc <dig> cells, but also significantly slowed migration and invasion of pc <dig> and du <dig> cells  <cit> .

our previous report identified cid <dig> as a potent and selective pkd inhibitor with an in vitro ic <dig> for pkd <dig> of  <dig> nm  <cit> . this compound also was active in cells and inhibited multiple known biological functions of pkd. cid <dig> was highly selective and did not inhibit multiple pkc isoforms tested, or camkiiα. this remarkable selectivity represents a significant improvement over compounds previously used to inhibit pkd, such as gö <dig>  a compound known foremost for its inhibition of pkcs  <cit> . despite its apparent high specificity and potent inhibition of pkd in vitro, its cellular activity was relatively weak. efforts to improve the potency of this compound are imperative to ensure its effective application in cells and animals.

in this study, we present the in vitro and cellular activity of five novel analogs of cid <dig>  the analogs were synthesized with modifications to both their core structures and side chains. we show that several of these analogs exhibited increased potency toward pkd inhibition both in vitro and in cells. additionally, they cause potent growth arrest, moderate cell death, and inhibition of migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells, supporting their potential for in vivo applications.

in vitro radiometric pkc kinase assay
the pkc in vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously  <cit> .

cell lines and western blot analysis
du <dig> and pc <dig> cells were maintained in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  and  <dig> units/l penicillin, and  <dig> mg/ml streptomycin in 5% co <dig> at 37°c. lncap cells were maintained as described previously  <cit> . western blot analysis was carried out as previously reported  <cit> . briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> μm 4-
benzenesulfonyl fluoride,  <dig> mm egta, and 1% triton x- <dig>  protein concentration was determined using the bca protein concentration assay reagent kit  and then equal amounts of protein were subjected to sds-page followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in tris-buffered saline and then probed with primary antibodies for either p-s916-pkd <dig> , p-s742-pkcμ/pkd , or gapdh, followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase . the enhanced chemiluminescence  western blotting detection system  was used to facilitate detection of protein bands.

mtt assay
pc <dig> cells were seeded into 96-well plates  and allowed to attach overnight. cells were then incubated in media containing  <dig> - <dig> μm inhibitors for  <dig> h. 3-- <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium  solution was prepared at  <dig> mg/ml concentration in pbs, sterilized by filtering through a  <dig>  μm filter, and wrapped in foil to protect from light.  <dig> μl mtt solution was added to each well and incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c. then, media was removed and  <dig> μl dmso was added to each well. the plate was mixed for  <dig> min and the optical density was determined at  <dig> nm.

cell proliferation assay and cell cycle analysis
proliferation of pc <dig> cells was measured by counting the number of viable cells upon trypan blue staining as previously described  <cit> . cell cycle analysis was performed as described  <cit> . briefly, pc <dig> cells were treated with indicated compounds at  <dig> μm concentration for  <dig> h, and then fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight and labeled with propidium iodide. the labeled cells were analyzed using a facscan benchtop cytometer .

wound healing assay
wound-induced migration was measured as described previously  <cit> . briefly, pc <dig> or du <dig> cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates. migration was initiated by scraping the monolayer with a pipette tip, creating a "wound." the indicated concentration of compound was added to the media, and the wound was imaged immediately under an inverted phase-contrast microscope with 10× objective. after  <dig> h, cells were fixed in methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet, and a final image was taken. the wound gap was measured, and % wound healing was calculated. the average % wound healing was determined based on at least  <dig> measurements of the wound gap.

matrigel invasion assay
du <dig> cells  in rpmi containing  <dig> % fetal bovine serum  were seeded into the top chamber of biocoat control inserts  or biocoat matrigel invasion inserts with matrigel-coated filters . to stimulate invasion, media in the lower chamber of the insert contained 20% fbs. inhibitors were added at  <dig> μm concentration to both the upper and lower chambers, and cells were incubated for  <dig> h. after incubation, noninvasive cells were removed using a cotton swab, and invasive cells were fixed in 100% methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet. after staining, cells were counted under a microscope . the percentage invasion was determined by cell counts in  <dig> fields of the number of cells that invaded the matrigel matrix relative to the number of cells that migrated through the control insert.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was completed using graphpad prism v software. a p value of <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
design of cid <dig> analogs
cid <dig> and cid <dig>  a structural analog of cid <dig>  were synthesized by the pmlsc chemistry core following the scheme illustrated in fig.  <dig> . cid <dig> is a byproduct of cid <dig> synthesis, and has 10-fold less inhibitory activity toward pkd than the parental compound  <cit> .

the design of the cid <dig> analogs was based on initial structure-activity relationship  analysis described in a separate manuscript . we dissected the parent compound cid <dig> into  <dig> major structural zones in order to elucidate a fundamental sar . in zone i, we modified the phenolic substituent as well as the α-position on the aromatic ring. in zone ii, we substituted the oxygen ring atom with sulfur and nitrogen. in zone iii, we altered the ring size by adding or removing methylene groups, as well as substituting the benzylic position. in zone iv, we pursued functional group interconversions as well as replacement of the amide with heterocyclic groups. most of the zone i derivatives were considerably less active than cid <dig> in the pkd screen. in particular, carbon substituents ortho to the phenol and o-benzylations were detrimental. in contrast, ortho-halogenation and o-methylation were well tolerated. nitrogen replacements in zone ii were associated with loss of activity, whereas sulfur substitution was not only tolerated well but lead often to a substantial increase in activity. among the zone iii substitutions, a thioether insertion exo to the five-membered heterocycle and an additional methylene group  were well tolerated. finally, all zone iv substitutions were unsatisfactory, and we decided to retain the amide function of cid <dig> in this position.

after initial screening and the sar analysis on ca  <dig> analogs summarized above, five novel compounds with equal or greater potency for pkd were selected for further testing .

in vitro activities of cid <dig> analogs
the in vitro inhibitory activities of the novel compounds toward pkd were determined using radiometric pkd kinase activity assays. recombinant human pkd <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig> was incubated with the substrate, syntide- <dig>  in the presence of  <dig> different concentrations of each compound. ic <dig> values were determined for each compound by plotting percent pkd activity versus compound concentration for each point. we found that while the compounds inhibited all three pkd isoforms, their potency and selectivity varied . the most potent compound was found to be kb-nb142- <dig>  which inhibited pkd <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm , showing a 7-fold greater inhibition than the parental compound . this compound was also a robust inhibitor of pkd <dig> and - <dig>  demonstrating respective ic50s of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . notably, kb-nb142- <dig> and kb-nb184- <dig> exhibited about 2-fold greater selectivity toward pkd <dig>  in contrast, the compound kb-nb165- <dig> was more selective toward pkd <dig>  showing approximately 2-fold greater inhibition of pkd <dig>  than pkd <dig> or - <dig> , which is unique among the compounds tested. other compounds, namely kb-nb165- <dig> and kb-nb165- <dig> showed similar inhibition of all three isoforms. overall, our results demonstrated that core structural modification of cid <dig> substantially enhanced its potency, but had less effect on isoform selectivity.

ic <dig> were determined for cid <dig> and its analogs against pkd <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> using radiometric kinase activity assays. each ic <dig> was calculated as the mean ± s.e.m. of at least three independent experiments with triplicate determinations at each concentration in each experiment as described in "methods." *n, number of independent experiments

the analogs inhibit pma-induced endogenous pkd <dig> activation
to determine whether the compounds are active in cells, we tested their ability to inhibit activation of pkd <dig> by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  in lncap prostate cancer cells. pkd <dig> has been shown to be the predominant isoform expressed in these cells  <cit> , and stimulation with pma leads to pkc-dependent phosphorylation of ser738/ <dig> in the activation loop followed by autophosphorylation of pkd <dig> on ser <dig> in the c-terminus  <cit> . since catalytic activity of pkd <dig> correlates well with the phosphorylation state of ser <dig>  <cit> , we measured both p-ser <dig> and p-ser <dig> levels by western blot analysis to track pkd <dig> activity. as is shown in fig.  <dig> , addition of pma alone induced phosphorylation of both ser <dig> and ser <dig> of pkd <dig>  when lncap cells were pretreated with the novel cid <dig> analogs before pma treatment, concentration-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation at both ser <dig> and ser <dig> of pkd <dig> was observed . this effect appeared to be most potent for the compound kb-nb142- <dig>  with a calculated cellular ic <dig> for inhibition of ser <dig> phosphorylation of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  . kb-nb165- <dig> and kb-nb165- <dig> showed similar cellular activity, with ic50s of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  respectively. consistent with our in vitro data, kb-nb184- <dig> was again the least potent compound, demonstrating a cellular ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . gapdh was used as a loading control instead of pkd <dig> because the pkd <dig> antibody showed a slight inconsistency in detecting phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of pkd <dig> . taken together, these results indicated that the analogs were capable of inhibiting pkd <dig> in intact cells.

cellular ic <dig> was determined by densitometry analysis of western blotting data for pkd <dig> autophosphorylation at s <dig> in lncap cells. each ic <dig> was calculated as the mean ± s.e.m. of at least two independent experiments. *n, number of independent experiments

specificity of cid <dig> and its analogs to pkd
we previously reported that cid <dig> showed selectivity toward pkd and did not inhibit several other kinases tested, including plk <dig>  cak, protein kinase b , pkcα, -βi, -δ, or camkiiα. to determine whether the novel analogs retained this specificity, we tested the compounds against their ability to inhibit pkcα, -βi, -δ, and camkiiα in in vitro radiometric kinase activity assays. all analogs were poor inhibitors of pkcα and pkcβi, with only slight  inhibitory activity at  <dig> μm concentration . this was also true for pkcδ and camkiiα with the exception of kb-nb165- <dig>  which did show nearly 50% inhibitory activity toward pkcδ and about 70% inhibition of camkiiα activity at  <dig> μm concentration . as a positive control, the potent pkc inhibitor gf109203x showed strong inhibition of all three of these isoforms .

to further investigate the specificity of this series of compounds, a kinase profiling experiment was conducted on cid <dig>  testing  <dig> additional kinases . cid <dig> showed "significant" inhibition  of six out of a total  <dig> kinases - mk <dig>  gsk-3β, ck1δ, mk5/prak, cdk <dig>  and erk <dig>  as a control, pkd <dig> activity was reduced by 95% when treated with  <dig> μm cid <dig>  a separate, smaller scale analysis of the kinase inhibition profile of the cid <dig> analogs has also been conducted and showed similar patterns of inhibition as the parental compound, indicating that the analogs of cid <dig> act on similar targets .

 <dig> kinases were interrogated using a single-dose in vitro kinase assay at  <dig> μm cid <dig>  - <dig> to +20% inhibition, baseline levels; > <dig> to 49% inhibition, compound only marginally actively inhibits the kinase; >50% inhibition, compound is actively inhibiting the kinase. the assay was performed by caliper life sciences .

effects of the cid <dig> analogs on tumor cell death, proliferation, and cell cycle distribution
given the effects of pkd <dig> knockdown by sirna or cid <dig> in the inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation  <cit>  and the implications that pkd regulates cell survival and proliferation  <cit> , we wanted to test whether the new compounds were cytotoxic and whether they also inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation. therefore, we determined the cytotoxic effects of the compounds on pc <dig> cells by mtt assay. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the parental compound induced very little cell death, having an ec <dig> of  <dig>  μm in this context. in contrast, the analogs showed considerable increases in cytotoxicity. kb-nb142- <dig> was again the most potent, causing considerable cell death and demonstrating an ec <dig> of  <dig>  μm. kb-nb165- <dig>  kb-nb165- <dig>  and kb-nb184- <dig> showed similar effects on cell death, with ec50s of  <dig>  μm,  <dig>  μm, and  <dig>  μm, respectively.

in addition to the novel analogs demonstrating increased cytotoxicity when compared to the parental compound, they also caused dramatic arrest in prostate cancer cell proliferation when applied at  <dig> μm concentration to pc <dig> cells, as determined by cell counts over six consecutive days . in contrast to the parental compound, which only slowed cell proliferation, the novel analogs drastically inhibited cell proliferation, with kb-nb142- <dig> being most potent among the compounds.

to gain insight into the mechanism of growth inhibition caused by the analogs, we conducted cell cycle analysis in pc <dig> cells. our previous data indicated the parent compound cid <dig> caused g2/m phase cell cycle arrest when applied at  <dig> or  <dig> μm for six days  <cit> . in the present study, pc <dig> cells were treated with  <dig> μm compound for  <dig> h and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide labeling of fixed cells. indeed, the compounds showed increased accumulation in the g2/m phase of the cell cycle when compared to the dmso treated control or to cid <dig>  . taken together, our data indicated that the novel analogs of cid <dig> were potent inhibitors of survival and proliferation in prostate cancer cells.

cid <dig> and its analogs cause accumulation of cyclin d <dig> and cyclin d3
though our evidence supports that cid <dig> and its analogs induce cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase, a recent study by torres-marquez et al. demonstrated that cid <dig> treatment enhanced phorbol ester- and growth factor-induced dna synthesis and g1/s cell cycle progression in swiss 3t <dig> cells independent of pkd <dig>  <cit> . in this study, it is important to note that both dna synthesis and cell cycle distribution were determined after  <dig> h cid <dig> treatment, while in our previous study cell proliferation was measured by counting cell numbers for six consecutive days of cid <dig> treatment  <cit> . although it was clear based on counting cell numbers that cid <dig> inhibited cell proliferation and ultimately caused g2/m arrest, our study did not rule out the possibility that this compound could affect other stages of cell cycle progression. to investigate this possibility and to determine if cid <dig> indeed affects the g1/s transition, we measured the levels of cell cycle markers in response to treatment with cid <dig> and its analogs. as shown in fig. 8a, cid <dig> induced cyclin d <dig> and d <dig> expression in a concentration-dependent manner in pc <dig> cells, suggesting a role for cid <dig> in promoting the g1/s transition. importantly however, the analogs of cid <dig>  with the exception of kb-nb165- <dig>  showed much reduced effects on levels of cyclin d <dig> or d <dig>  implying the specificity of these compounds was improved . these data support the idea that cid <dig> and its analogs have a complex effect on cell cycle progression; in addition to the induction of g2/m arrest and subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation, these compounds may also promote the g1/s transition.

effects of the cid <dig> analogs on tumor cell migration and invasion
previous reports have indicated that pkd may have important roles in the regulation of cell motility, adhesion, and invasion  <cit> . additionally, we previously demonstrated that the pkd inhibitor cid <dig> slowed cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells  <cit> . in order to assess whether the novel analogs of cid <dig> retained the ability to slow prostate cancer cell migration and invasion, we performed two assays. first, we evaluated the effects of the compounds on migration in both du <dig> and pc <dig> cells by wound healing assay. confluent cells were wounded and then treated with either  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm inhibitor. wound closure was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner in both du <dig> and pc <dig> cells . in this assay, kb-nb142- <dig> and kb-nb165- <dig> were the most potent inhibitors of wound healing, with wounds showing only 25-35% closure when treated with  <dig> μm concentration of these two compounds. kb-nb165- <dig> appeared to strongly resemble the potency of the parental compound, demonstrating 55-60% wound closure at  <dig> μm concentration in both pc <dig> and du <dig> cells. the analogs also significantly inhibited tumor cell invasion measured by matrigel invasion assay . consistent with our previously reported results,  <dig> μm cid <dig> significantly inhibited invasion of du <dig> cells. invasion was also inhibited by kb-nb165- <dig>  kb-nb165- <dig>  and kb-nb184- <dig> at levels similar to the parental compound. however, kb-nb142- <dig> and kb-nb165- <dig> showed increased potency in this assay, reducing percent invasion to only 10%. taken together, these results support the conclusion that the novel analogs of cid <dig> are potent inhibitors of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion.

discussion
in this study, we report the generation and characterization of five novel analogs of the pkd inhibitor cid <dig>  this compound, previously identified as a novel pkd inhibitor, inhibited pkd <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm in vitro, and blocked cancer-associated properties of prostate cancer cells. the novel analogs, synthesized to have modifications in both the core structure and side chains, showed equal or increased potency to pkd <dig> inhibition in vitro and in cells when compared with cid <dig>  additionally, we confirmed they also inhibited pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> in vitro, acting as pan-pkd inhibitors like the parental compound. of the compounds reported here, the most potent was kb-nb142- <dig>  which inhibited pkd <dig> with nearly a 7-fold greater potency compared to the parental compound. furthermore, kb-nb142- <dig> inhibited pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> about 4-fold stronger than cid <dig>  the analogs also demonstrated increased inhibition of pma-induced autophosphorylation of endogenous pkd <dig> in lncap prostate cancer cells when compared to the parental compound. thus, we have established that these small molecule analogs of cid <dig> are also potent inhibitors of pkd both in vitro and in cells.

cid <dig> is superior in specificity when compared with other compounds known to inhibit pkd, such as staurosporine and staurosporine-related the compounds k252a and gö <dig>  even though these compounds have been reported to inhibit pkd in the low double- and single-digit nanomolar range . a kinase profiling report demonstrated that cid <dig> may also target a few additional kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase-3β , casein kinase 1δ , mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase   <dig>  mk <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig> . importantly however, cid <dig> lacks or shows only marginal activity towards almost all pkc isoforms that have been tested thus far , which distinguishes it from the commonly used pkc/pkd inhibitors such as gö <dig>  this feature may allow selective targeting of pkd-mediated signaling pathways and cellular processes, though discretion must be used since additional targets of cid <dig> do indeed exist. similar to the parental compound, the novel analogs for the most part retained specificity when tested against pkcα, -βi, -δ, and camkiiα. one compound, kb-nb165- <dig>  did show significant inhibitory activity toward pkcδ and camkiiα when tested at  <dig> μm concentration. this compound has an iodine atom added as a side chain of the benzene ring in kb-nb142- <dig>  which retained strong selectivity to pkd in vitro, suggesting that the increase in lipophilicity and the introduction of a polarizable group at the phenol ortho-position reduce compound specificity. interestingly, in the case of kb-nb165- <dig>  the expansion of the lactam by one carbon to a fused 8-membered ring reduced the potencies for pkd <dig> and pkd <dig> by 2- <dig> fold, while not altering potency for pkd <dig>  implying that zone iii of our pharmacophore may contain determinants for isoform-selectivity. however, this concept should be further exploited as methoxy analogs of kb-nb142- <dig> and kb-nb165- <dig>  in contrast, did not exhibit an analogous shift in isoform-selectivity.

cellular activity of the analogs was demonstrated through inhibition of pma-induced activation of endogenous pkd <dig> by measuring the phosphorylation levels of ser <dig> and ser <dig>  based on the canonical pathway of pkc-dependent pkd activation, phorbol ester-stimulated phosphorylation on ser738/ <dig> by pkc followed by autophosphorylation of pkd <dig> on ser <dig> would result in full activation of pkd  <cit> . however, recent studies suggest that ser <dig> may be a site of both trans- and autophosphorylation. while initial, early catalytic activation of pkd requires rapid transphosphorylation on ser738/ <dig> by pkc isoenzymes, the major mechanism required to maintain prolonged pkd activation is ser <dig> autophosphorylation  <cit> . therefore, the observed dose-dependent inhibition of ser <dig> phosphorylation on pkd <dig> after agonist stimulation  by our novel analogs reflects the inhibition of pkd <dig> autophosphorylation at this site, analogous to the inhibition of ser <dig> phosphorylation. further analysis is required to determine the precise mechanism of inhibition of pkd by these novel compounds.

pkd has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and apoptotic pathways in multiple cell types  <cit> . we have previously shown that pc <dig> cells predominantly express high levels of pkd <dig>  potentially making them very sensitive to pkd <dig> inhibition, and that knockdown of pkd <dig> by sirna causes strong arrest in cell proliferation in these cells  <cit> . here, we have shown that one of the more striking differences between the parental compound and its analogs is the increase in cytotoxicity and dramatic arrest in cell proliferation. while cid <dig> is only minimally cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells, and can be tolerated at high concentrations for prolonged treatments  <cit> , the novel analogs induced significant cytotoxicity in pc <dig> cells after much shorter treatments  and at much lower concentrations . based on our preliminary analysis, the effects of the compounds on viability in other prostate cancer cells  are comparable to those in pc <dig> cells . the inhibitors appear to exhibit a general inhibitory effect on cell viability, with potency varying between different tumor cell types. additionally, the analogs cause much more potent arrest in cell proliferation than the parental compound. since the anti-proliferative effects of the analogs phenocopied those caused by knockdown of pkd <dig> in pc <dig> cells, it is conceivable that these effects, at least to some extent, are mediated through inhibition of pkd. that said, we cannot exclude the possibility that cid <dig> and its analogs have additional cellular targets whose inhibition may contribute to the elevated cytotoxicity and potent growth arrest observed in prostate cancer cells. moreover, since the analogs, mimicking the parental compound, all induced apparent g2/m cell cycle arrest, it is likely that the mechanisms underlying the growth inhibition caused by the analogs are similar to those induced by the parental compound. based on the kinase profiling data, we speculate that, in addition to pkd, the inhibitory effect of cid <dig> and its analogs on cell proliferation may be contributed to the inhibition of cdk <dig>  another potential target of cid <dig>  although cdk <dig> is generally considered a regulator of s-phase entry  <cit> , some reports have also linked it to the g2/m transition  <cit> . according to the accepted model of cell cycle progression, cdk <dig> is activated by binding to cyclin e in late g <dig> phase, resulting in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein  and facilitating the g1/s-phase transition  <cit> . it also promotes progression of s-phase by binding to cyclin a. however, it has been reported that inhibition of cdk <dig> by expression of a dominant negative cdk <dig> mutant or overexpression of p27kip <dig> can cause accumulation in g2/m  <cit> . therefore, it is plausible that the g2/m arrest and reduced cell proliferation caused by cid <dig> and its analogs is in part due to inhibition of cdk <dig>  it is also possible that cid <dig> and its analogs may inhibit other members of the cdk family, for example cdk <dig>  which plays a critical role in g2/m cell cycle progression. finally, it must be stated that although ckd <dig> and a few other proteins were identified as potential hits in a single dose kinase profiling experiment, the activities of cid <dig> and its analogs toward these targets need to be further validated in 10-point dose-response kinase assays.

although cid <dig> and its analogs potently inhibited cell proliferation, their effects on cell cycle progression appeared to complex, involving two opposing effects on different stages of the cell cycle: 1) promotion of the g1/s transition; 2) induction of g2/m arrest. the g2/m arrest ultimately leads to cessation of cell proliferation. our findings that cid <dig> and its analogs induced cyclin d <dig> and d <dig> expression may underlie the potentiation effect of cid <dig> on the g1/s transition induced by other mitogens  <cit> . given that the report by torres-marquez et al. used dna synthesis and cell cycle distribution as readouts, it remains to be determined if the potentiation effect reported indeed resulted in increased cell number  since the g2/m block may ultimately inhibit this effect. with regard to the potential targets that may account for this effect, we hypothesize, based on our kinase profiling data, that gsk-3β could play a role since active gsk-3β has a negative effect on cell cycle progression  <cit> . expression of the cell cycle proteins cyclin d <dig> and cyclin d <dig> is regulated by gsk-3β signaling at the transcriptional level and through protein degradation  <cit> . thus, inhibition of gsk-3β may be in part responsible for the promotion of the g1/s transition and the reported potentiation effect with other mitogens. it is important to note that the analogs of cid <dig> in general showed less activity in inducing cyclin d <dig> or d <dig> expression, suggesting that they are less active at promoting the g1/s transition and are more selective for pkd. this correlated to their much enhanced growth suppressive and cytotoxic effects in prostate cancer cells, implying that reducing/removing the g1/s cell cycle-promoting effect of the analogs could significantly improve the antitumor activity of these analogs.

in addition to the effects of these analogs on cell survival and proliferation, we also show that they are potent inhibitors of prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. kb-nb142- <dig> and kb-nb165- <dig> in particular, strongly reduced wound healing in both du <dig> cells and pc <dig> cells in a dose-dependent manner, and significantly inhibited invasion of du <dig> cells through matrigel invasion inserts when applied at  <dig> μm concentration. furthermore, the pattern of inhibition exhibited by the analogs is fairly consistent with their inhibitory activities toward pkd. this suggests an important role for pkd in prostate cancer cell motility and supports the potential value of therapeutic targeting of pkd in the reduction or prevention of prostate tumor metastases. though the mechanism through which pkd may mediate migration and invasion is not yet known, several recent reports have begun to shed light onto the complexity of these signaling pathways, suggesting pkd involvement in both β-catenin and akt signaling in prostate cancer cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report the biochemical and functional analysis of several novel analogs of the pkd inhibitor cid <dig>  these analogs show equal and increased potency toward pkd inhibition both in vitro and in cells. the new lead compounds display prominent cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects, and potently inhibit migration and invasion in prostate cancer cells. although the molecular mechanisms underlying some of the biological effects of these compounds appear to be complex and may involve additional targets, their potent effects on multiple cancer-associated biologies warrant further development of this series of compounds toward possible clinical application in cancer therapy.
