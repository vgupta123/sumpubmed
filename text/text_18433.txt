BACKGROUND
the therapeutic hormone insulin is a small protein used daily in the medical treatment of diabetes by millions of people. the primary administration route is by subcutaneous injections of microcrystals or mixtures of microcrystals and amorphous protein. after subcutaneous injection, the insulin crystals dissolve slowly, thus leading to a slow intermediate release of insulin into the blood stream. ever since the biological function of insulin was discovered in the 1920s  <cit> , the molecule has been widely characterized both biophysically and structurally. the crystallographic structure was one of the first protein structures determined  <cit> . it has since then been crystallized in a number of space groups of which the most common belong to the monoclinic, rhombohedral, cubic and tetragonal crystal forms. the type, size and morphology of the crystals affect how fast insulin is released, which is why crystallization of insulin has been studied extensively. alternative administration routes are presently a rapidly expanding research field and insulin microcrystals may be well suited for other delivery methods, including pulmonary delivery or sustained release formulations  <cit> . the insulin molecule consists of two chains, a and b, with  <dig> and  <dig> residues respectively. chain a is built up by two helical fragments separated by a short loop linked to one of the helices by an intra-chain disulfide bond. two additional disulfide bonds link chain a to the larger chain b. in the biologically active form, insulin exists as a monomer in which chain b contains a central helical region flanked by two elongated parts. in the presence of divalent ions like zinc, the monomers assemble into hexamers  <cit> , where each of the two central zinc ions is coordinated by three histidine residues. in the hexameric form, chain b has been shown to exist in two allosteric states denoted t and r  <cit> . the r state has two allosteric binding sites usually referred to as the phenolic binding site and hisb <dig> anion site. the t → r state transition and the two different b chain conformations, referred to as t <dig> and r <dig>  have been described by spectroscopic and crystallographic studies. the t <dig> conformation, which is characterized by an extended conformation of residues 1– <dig> of chain b, is obtained at low chloride concentrations and in absence of phenol derivatives  <cit> . phenolic derivatives are used as preservative in insulin pharmaceutical formulations. the most commonly used are phenol, meta-cresol, resorcinol and methylparaben. the r conformation is obtained in presence of these derivatives and at high chloride concentrations. in this form the first eight residues of the b chain adopt a helical conformation, which together with the central helical segment gives a continuous helix which includes residues b <dig> to b <dig>  <cit> . this transition from an extended to an alpha-helical conformation causes the first residue of chain b, pheb <dig> to undergo a ~ <dig> Å shift in position. although chloride is the most commonly used anion, other anions such as scn-, ocn-, cn-, n3- and no2- have also been shown to be useful  <cit> . like chloride, in the absence of phenolic derivatives and at high concentrations, these anions are able to induce the r state in three of six monomers in a hexamer. the remaining three monomers have an extended conformation  in the region including residues b <dig> to b <dig>  the r state of the first three monomers is incomplete with residues b <dig> to b <dig> in a helical conformation, while residues b <dig> to b <dig> have an extended conformation. this hexamer configuration is denoted t3r3f, where the 'f' indicates a frayed r conformation  <cit> .

we here present a study which shows that certain chaotropic additives can induce two novel types of insulin crystals, and that the type of crystals formed depends on the charge state of insulin, i.e. is ph dependent. the structures and crystal packing interaction of the two new crystal forms have been analyzed and compared to crystal packing interactions in other previously known insulin crystals.

RESULTS
crystallization of insulin is of high importance in pharmaceutical formulations and in insulin manufacturing and has been systematically investigated since the 1920s  <cit> . by introducing chaotropic agents in the crystallization experiments, we succeeded in identifying two new crystal forms of native human insulin. the crystals were found using two different crystallization experiments. the first crystals were obtained in a crystallization screen with varying concentrations of urea and sodium chloride in presence of zinc and resorcinol. the crystals were initially characterized by x-ray powder diffraction and were shown to have a powder pattern differing from previously known insulin crystal forms  <cit> . further optimizations of crystallization conditions resulted in crystals suitable for single crystal analysis and determination of crystal system which was found to be orthorhombic in space group c <dig>  the crystals appeared in the ph range  <dig>  –  <dig>  while a second type of crystals, characterized as monoclinic with space group c <dig> grew in the ph range  <dig>  –  <dig> . in the overlapping ph interval around ph  <dig> , the c <dig> crystals were present in wells with lower salt and urea concentrations. a few drops contained a mixture of the two crystal types. in a parallel experiment, the urea and sodium chloride were substituted for thiocyanate. interestingly, the same two crystal types appeared here, at the same ph intervals, with a clearer ph distinction at ph  <dig> . crystallization with thiocyanate or chloride ions without a phenol derivative has previously been shown to stabilize the t3r3f form of hexameric insulin in a rhombohedral crystal system  <cit> . in our case when resorcinol and thiocyanate were present, the orthorhombic c <dig> and monoclinic c <dig> crystals appeared. the well characterized monoclinic crystals in space group p <dig>  <cit>  were present at ph values above  <dig>  in wells with low salt and high urea concentration and increased in frequency as the ph was raised to become the dominating crystal form at ph ≥  <dig> . the crystals obtained in presence of urea will be referred to as c2221urea and c2urea while the two crystal forms obtained with thiocyanate are referred to as c2221scn and c2scn.

structure of insulin in the orthorhombic lattice
the crystals grown at ph  <dig> , from both the urea- and thiocyanate  screen, were found to belong to space group c <dig> with unit cell parameters a =  <dig> Å, b =  <dig> Å, c =  <dig> Å. the asymmetric unit contains three insulin hexamers with a crystal solvent content of 64%. the hexamers have r <dig> conformation and contain two zinc atoms/hexamer coordinated to three histidine residues . in the c2221urea crystal, the zinc is additionally coordinated by a chloride ion at an average distance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, whilst in the c2221scn crystal structure the chloride ion is replaced by a thiocyanate. the thiocyanate coordinates to zinc through its nitrogen atom with an average distance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å. the three hexamers in the asymmetric unit are arranged in an angular formation where the central hexamer connects the two outer hexamers with an angle of ~110°, figure 1a. the non-crystallographic three-fold axes which pass through the two zinc atoms in each hexamer are almost orthogonal to each other. in both the c2221urea and c2221scn structures, one co-crystallized resorcinol molecule is bound to each insulin monomer in the phenolic binding pocket. the resorcinol molecule is hydrogen bonded with its first hydroxy group to the carbonyl o atom of cysa <dig> , and the n atom of cysa <dig> . the second hydroxy group hydrogen bonds to a water molecule with an average distance of  <dig>  Å. this water molecule forms another hydrogen bond to the o atom of cysa <dig> with an average distance of  <dig>  Å. in the final stages of refinement, one glycerol molecule was modeled into the c2221scn structure at a position where it interacted through its oxygen atoms with the amide nitrogen of pheb <dig>  and the carbonyl oxygen of thra <dig> . the crystal packing of the c2221urea structure is shown in figure 1b.

structure of insulin in the monoclinic lattice
the crystals obtained at slightly higher ph  belong to the monoclinic space group c <dig> with cell dimensions a =  <dig> Å, b =  <dig> Å, c =  <dig> Å, β = 116°. they contain one hexamer with r <dig> conformation in the asymmetric unit and have a solvent content of 50%. the crystal packing is shown in figure 1c. both the c2urea and c2scn structures have two zinc atoms/hexamer located  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å apart respectively. the zinc coordination is identical to the c <dig> crystals. in the c2urea structure, two additional resorcinol molecules could be fitted into the electron density. the location of the first is very close to binding site ii, described in  <cit> . at this site, the first hydroxy group of the resorcinol molecule is hydrogen bonded to the og atom of serb <dig>  in an alternating conformation. the other hydroxyl group interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of glub <dig>  and a water molecule . the water molecule, in turn, makes a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of serb <dig> . in contrast to the phenolic binding interactions observed earlier in the pdb entry 1zeg <cit> , where the phenolic oxygen hydrogen binds to hisb <dig>  the angular orientation of the hisb <dig> in the c2urea structure does not seem to permit any interaction with the resorcinol molecule. the second additional resorcinol is located at the surface of the insulin in a solvent channel between two monomers, surrounded by water molecules. at the end of refinement, one glycerol molecule from the cryo-solution was added to both c <dig> structures. the glycerol molecule in the c2scn structure was found at a corresponding position as in the c2221scn structure, while the glycerol molecule in the c2urea structure was found in the solvent channel leading towards one of the zinc atoms, where it interacted with surrounding water molecules.

refinement statistics for the four crystal forms is shown in table  <dig>   <dig> % of the residues in the c2221urea structure were found in the most favored regions of the ramachandran plot and  <dig> % in additional allowed regions. for the c2221scn structure, the corresponding values were  <dig> % and  <dig> % and for the c <dig> structures   <dig> %/ <dig> % and  <dig> %/ <dig> %, respectively. the models showed no residues located in the generously allowed or disallowed regions of the plot.

all four insulin molecules are structurally very similar. pair-wise superposition and comparison of the c <dig> structures results in a root-mean-square  distance between corresponding cα atoms of  <dig>  Å and of  <dig>  Å when all common atoms are included. for the c <dig> structures the same r.m.s. distances are  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å.

a common feature of the four structures is the disruption of the otherwise characteristic continuous a-helix from reside b <dig> to b <dig>  instead of having a-helical conformation, some of the pheb <dig> residues in all four structures have a non-helical conformation. in the c <dig> structures, the majority of the b-chains  have this conformation  where the phi/psi values of valb <dig> are -80/+ <dig>  in the second conformation , the phi/psi values are ~-60/- <dig>  closer to the typical values for an a-helix. the different b-chain conformations are illustrated in figure  <dig>  where they are superposed on each other. the distance between the ca-atom of the pheb <dig> residue in the two different conformations is ~ <dig> Å. for some of the residues, electron density could be seen for backbone atoms in more than one orientation. in such cases, the conformation with highest density was chosen, where also side chain atoms could be modeled with confidence. it should be noted that the density is weak for the side chain atoms of the phe <dig> residue in chains b, f, b, f, h, j and l in the c2221scn structure and chains h, j, l in the c2221urea structure . the pheb <dig> orientations in the c <dig> structures resemble those of the c <dig> structures. three out of the six b-chains in each structure have a non-helical conformation. the electron density is generally better defined in these two structures, which is reflected in the crystallographic b-factors. a comparison of the b-factors shows that pheb <dig> residues with non-helical conformation have a lower b-factor in three of the four structures, table  <dig> 

in contrast to the t3r3f conformation, where b1–b <dig> have an extended conformation, only resides b1–b <dig> have a non-helical state. a similar, non-helical conformation of the pheb <dig> residue has previously been observed for one of the b-chains in an r <dig> insulin in complex with resorcinol   <cit> . in that case, the carbonyl oxygen of pheb <dig> is coordinating a sodium ion which was further coordinated by the c terminal asna <dig> of a symmetry-related molecule. in our case, pheb <dig> is stabilized in a non-helical conformation by a hydrogen bond between amide nitrogen of pheb <dig> to the carbonyl oxygen of thra <dig> in a neighboring molecule, or a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of pheb <dig> and the amide nitrogen of asnb <dig> in the same chain. there are further interactions with symmetry-related molecules, such as the pheb <dig> amide nitrogen interactions with the oh group of a symmetry-related tyra <dig>  or the carbonyl oxygen of cysa <dig> and asna <dig> 

in close proximity to the pheb <dig> residue of the three b chains with non-helical conformation in the c2urea structure there was an electron density peak with a height of  <dig> σ in the 2fo-fc map and ~ <dig> σ in a fo-fc difference map. the location of the peak was close to the position where the carbonyl oxygen of pheb <dig> would be located if the conformation was a-helical. given the observed electron density, a chloride ion was fitted into this position. it is coordinated to the amide nitrogen of hisb <dig>  and two or three water molecules at an average distance of  <dig>  Å. the corresponding sites in the c2221urea structure were too disordered to be interpreted in a similar manner.

location of main-chain and side-chain atoms was ambiguous for the residues lysb <dig> and thrb <dig> in most of the chains in the four structures. furthermore, the following residues were modeled with alternating side chain conformations; c2urea structure: glnb <dig> , serb <dig> , valb <dig> , leub <dig> ; c2scn structure: glub <dig> , valb <dig> ; c2221urea structure: leub <dig> i. <dig>  argb <dig> i. <dig>  glnb <dig> i. <dig>  valb <dig> ii. <dig> asnb <dig> iii.1; c2221scn structure: valb <dig> i. <dig>  valb <dig> ii. <dig>  valb <dig> ii. <dig> .

crystal packing
there is a strikingly high similarity between the crystallographic contact surfaces of the c <dig> and c <dig> crystal forms. for five of the six contact sites found in the c <dig> crystal form, there is a corresponding contact surface with equivalent residue composition in the c <dig> structure. each hexamer in the c <dig> structure has one symmetry-related contact surface that is identical to the hexamer-hexamer contact in the asymmetric unit. including the hexamer-hexamer contacts within the asymmetric unit results in five such contact interfaces. in comparison, the c <dig> structure has in total six neighboring symmetry-related hexamers of which only one has the same kind of pair-wise interactions as the asymmetric hexamer-hexamer contact in the c <dig> structure. an overview of the crystal contacts in the c <dig> and c <dig> crystals is shown in figure  <dig> 

a special crystal interaction at the dimer-dimer interface
each of the two hexamer-hexamer interfaces in the asymmetric unit of the c <dig> crystals involves tyrosine-tyrosine interactions between different tyr a <dig> groups. tyr a <dig> is located at the dimer-dimer interface within the insulin hexamer so that the crystal packing brings four different tyr a <dig> groups in proximity, figure  <dig>  the tyrosine side chains are pair wise stacked, such that the oh-group of tyra <dig> in the first hexamer hydrogen bonds to the backbone oxygen of a tyra <dig> in the neighboring hexamer . the oh-group of the latter tyra <dig> forms, in turn, hydrogen bonds to two water molecules. the polar interactions between the hexamers, figure  <dig>  comprise hydrogen bonds between glna <dig> i ne <dig> – glua <dig> ii oe <dig> , glua <dig> i oe <dig> – glna <dig> ii ne <dig>  . additionally, there is an unusually short contact between two glutamates, glua <dig> i oe <dig> – glua <dig> ii oe <dig> . in spite of the relative high ph of  <dig> , the short glu-glu distance suggests a protonated carboxyl group of one of the glutamates. normally, the pka value for an exposed glutamate residue is ~ <dig>  in water environment. given that glua <dig> is protonated, the pka value must thus be higher. one arginine  is located  <dig>  Å from each glutamate and could potentially shift the pka value by its inductive effect. the pka value could also be shifted by the surrounding hydrophobic environment. glua <dig> is flanked by the two tyrosine-tyrosine interactions, and it is conceivable that an uncharged protonated glutamate is more favorable in that environment. the short distance is indicative of a strong, low barrier hydrogen bond, where the proton is shared between the two carboxylates. such low barrier hydrogen bonds have been found in protein active sites as part of enzyme catalysis  <cit>  but also on protein surfaces  <cit> .

as the ph is increased to  <dig> , the second crystal form c <dig> appears. in this crystal form, there is only one crystal packing interaction comprising the tight glutamate-glutamate and tyrosine-tyrosine interaction, figure  <dig>  the increased ph could be the reason for the smaller number of such contacts. at higher ph, the shared hydrogen between the two glutamates becomes more delocalized and the repulsive forces will dominate. consequently, the distance between the carboxylates is longer,  <dig>  Å, versus  <dig>  Å for the c <dig> structures, indicating a weaker interaction at this ph. at ph values above  <dig> , only the monoclinic p <dig> crystal form  <cit>  is observed, in which no such interface exists.

interestingly, the position occupied by the tyrosine from a neighboring hexamer is known to bind phenolic compounds like resorcinol and m-cresol  <cit> . in figure 5a–c the phenolic binding sites in the pdb files 1evr  and 1ev <dig>   <cit>  are compared with one of the hexamer-hexamer interfaces in the c2221urea structure. the phenyl ring of the neighboring tyrosine superposes the phenolic derivatives and should contribute to the stability of both the hexamer contact and the insulin structure.

analysis of crystal contact surfaces
in order to compare the different crystal forms of insulin, the contact sites were characterized by means of polarity and contact area. a summary of the properties for the various contact sites for the four structures presented in this study is shown in table  <dig>  data for other crystal forms of hexameric insulin are also included. the surface area buried by crystal contacts range from  <dig> Å  <dig> to  <dig> Å  <dig>  which constitutes a fraction of buried surface area of between  <dig> % and 24%. the smallest value is found for the orthorhombic c <dig> crystals where the total contacts surface for the three hexamers is  <dig> Å  <dig>  which amounts to a contact surface of  <dig> Å 2/hexamer. the largest surface area originates from the rhombohedral crystal form, space group r <dig> with t <dig> configuration of the b-chain, pdb id: 1mso  <cit> . the monoclinic crystals in space group c <dig> and p <dig> as well as the tetragonal crystal in space group p <dig> all have six contact sites while the rest have eight. the size of individual contact sites ranges from  <dig> Å  <dig> to  <dig> Å  <dig>

the contact surfaces were characterized as either polar  or non-polar . the four structures presented in this study constitute a group with a high fraction of non-polar contact surface, ranging from 53% to 56% of the total contact area, compared to 41% to 50% for the other crystal forms. the monoclinic p <dig> crystal form is the most hydrophilic, with a 40/ <dig> distribution between hydrophobic and hydrophilic contact area. this analysis is limited in that bound water molecules were not considered in the crystal contact interactions since the criteria for modeling water molecules may vary among crystallographers and are also dependent on data quality. several interactions could however involve hydrogen bonds to water molecules. side chains with missing atoms were rebuilt in order to use the surface with an atom composition representing the true surface for the property calculations. they were however rebuilt automatically and could potentially be in a wrong orientation.

comparing the residue identity of the crystal contacts for the crystals presented in table  <dig> shows that seven of the interface residues are common for all crystal forms . altogether, the contact sites for the six crystal types compared in this study cover almost the entire surface of an insulin hexamer. a comparison of the exposed residues with the residues involved in crystal contacts shows that all residues with an exposure of more than 20% participate in some contact interface. the degree of exposure was calculated according to  <cit> . a number of studies, where crystal packing contacts have been systematically investigated  <cit>  conclude that atomic composition within crystal contacts is indistinguishable from that of the protein surface and is rather non-specific. studies of pancreatic ribonuclease  <cit>  and cutinase  <cit> , crystallized in a number of space groups, showed in accordance with the present study that virtually the entirely protein surface can be involved in crystal contacts.

urea binding
the c2221urea and c2urea crystals were grown in presence of  <dig> m and  <dig> m urea, respectively. seven urea molecules were built into the c <dig> structure. five of these were located at equivalent positions in the monomers, figure  <dig>  the nitrogen atoms hydrogen bond primarily to the carbonyl oxygen of glna <dig>  but the carbonyl oxygen of sera <dig> and ilea <dig> are also within a reasonable hydrogen bonding distance . in monomer six, the urea is either disordered or not present. instead, a water molecule was built into the density. nine out of  <dig> possible equivalent positions in the c <dig> structure were occupied by urea. in the nine positions without a urea molecule, water was built in. furthermore, these positions are more distant to a neighboring hexamer and therefore have a less well-defined electron density which may explain the inability to model a urea molecule. exceptions from the above generalization are the monomers ii. <dig> and iii. <dig>  which are close to a neighboring hexamer, but the electron density indicates two ordered water molecules.

insulin has been shown to be tolerant of high concentrations of urea and other denaturants  <cit>  and urea has previously been used to increase its solubility. one example is the inclusion of urea to promote growth of larger crystals of an insulin-protamine complex  <cit> . no significant conformational changes were detected in our structures as a result of direct urea interactions. in spite of its common use as a chemical denaturant of proteins, the molecular mechanism of urea-mediated unfolding is not known. identification of denaturant interactions with proteins may give insight into the early stages of protein unfolding  <cit> . for a denaturant to be effective, protein-solvent interactions must be disturbed and this is thought to happen either through a direct or an indirect mechanism  <cit> . a direct mechanism would involve binding of urea molecules to the protein surface and thus compete with water-protein interactions and enhance the solubility of hydrophobic residues. indirect urea denaturation would involve disruption of solvent-mediated hydrophobic interactions which would destabilize the protein structure. in addition, studies have shown that urea and guanidine hydrochloride at sub-denaturant concentrations stabilizes proteins at a sub global level in a mechanism called protein stiffening  <cit> . the present study shows that urea at concentrations ~ <dig> m has one specific binding site on the surface of the insulin molecule, interacting with backbone carbonyl groups of primarily glna <dig> but also of sera <dig> and ilea <dig> residues. given the high concentrations of urea present in the crystallization experiments, we would expect to detect even weak binding sites with a kd of several hundred mm. thus it seems unlikely that insulin denaturation occurs via a direct mechanism which requires binding of several urea molecules. on the other hand we see no signs of partial unfolding in our structures which would be indicative of an indirect mechanism. a recent study suggests that the denaturant effect of urea is neither due to a direct or indirect mechanism but rather an effect of a reduction of ion pairing between ionic and polar groups at aggregate surfaces  <cit> , something which also could explain the relative higher fraction of non-polar surface at crystal contacts in our crystal forms.

CONCLUSIONS
in spite of the extensive research on insulin crystallization during the last  <dig> years we could surprisingly identify two new crystal forms of human insulin. the major factor behind the change of space group from c <dig> to c <dig> was an increase in ph from ~ <dig>  to  <dig> . a comparison of the crystal contacts in the two space groups showed that the interfaces are very similar. the most obvious difference and the most remarkable contact interaction was the double tyra14-tyra <dig> interaction combined with a tight glua17-glua <dig> interaction. when taking all symmetry-related contacts into account it was found that this contact type was more frequent in the c <dig> crystals when compared to the c <dig> crystals. this crystal packing interaction has not been observed in any of the previously known insulin crystals. the addition of chaotropes such as urea and thiocyanate to the crystallization buffer can have an effect on the protein charge properties by charge screening. this could explain altered pka values of the glutamic acids involved in the crystal contacts and the higher fraction of hydrophobic crystal contacts in the present crystal forms compared to previously known insulin crystals. the short carboxyl-carboxyl interaction indicates the presence of a shared proton between the two groups and would be a strong low barrier hydrogen bond which should contribute to the stability of the crystals.

in the case of insulin, much effort has been put into the modification of the dimerization interactions  <cit>  and hexamer formations  <cit> , but less focus has been on the inter-hexamer interactions in solution or within crystals. modifications of surface residues can induce changes in crystal packing due to breaking of existing interactions and/or formation of new ones  <cit> . engineering of the protein surface to specifically induce a change in the crystal form or improve stability in lattice contacts may produce a better diffracting crystal  <cit> . since insulin is a therapeutic protein administered also in crystalline form, the discovery and analysis of new polymorphic forms has implications beyond providing improved crystals for structural studies. the inter-hexamer interaction found in the present structures provides an interesting and novel interface that is specific for these two crystal forms. a single additional hydrophobic or several polar interactions may increase the half-life of a protein by several orders of magnitude  <cit> . thus, additional inter-hexamer interactions can increase the stability and thus the shelf life of crystalline insulin formulations. the structures presented here provide a framework for further site-directed mutagenesis studies of the residues involved in inter-hexamer interactions, aimed at providing improved formulations useable within the rapidly advancing field of alternate delivery routes of crystalline biopharmaceuticals  <cit> .

this study also demonstrates the usefulness of x-ray powder diffraction  on protein samples. the small size of the initially obtained micro crystals made visual analysis and single crystal x-ray diffraction difficult. however, the combination of xrpd and principal component analysis  facilitated the identification of a new crystal form  <cit> . since the use of proteins as therapeutic agents is a growing field, applications of protein xrpd, similar to the present study, will have an important role during discovery and development of therapeutic protein formulations.
