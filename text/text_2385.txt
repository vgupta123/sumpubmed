BACKGROUND
iron is a common co-factor for redox-dependent enzymes and an essential element for almost all living organisms. in nature iron is abundant; however, in aerobic environments and under general physiological conditions, iron typically exists in the insoluble ferric  form, thus rendering acquisition by organisms difficult. under conditions of iron limitation, many bacteria produce and secrete low molecular weight ferric-specific ligands known as siderophores . the ferric-siderophores deliver iron to the cell via specific receptor and transport systems .

collectively, pseudomonas spp. produce a wide variety of siderophores  <cit> , the most complex and common of which are pyoverdines   <cit> . pvds contain a peptide moiety, usually between 6– <dig> amino acids in length, and a dihydroxyquinoline chromophore moiety  <cit> , which gives pvd its characteristic yellow-green fluorescent appearance. pvd-mediated iron uptake processes have been extensively characterized in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao <dig>  where key regulatory and structural proteins have been identified, and regulatory mechanisms have been elucidated  <cit> .

in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the primary level of pvd regulation involves the ferric uptake regulator , which, upon interaction with ferrous iron , binds to a specific dna sequence  in the promoter region of certain iron-regulated genes and blocks transcription. under iron-deplete conditions  fur-dependent repression is relieved  <cit> . pao <dig> pvd genes that possess fur boxes, which have been demonstrated to bind fur in vitro  <cit> , are pvds and fpvi, which encode extracytoplasmic family  sigma factors, and fpvr, an inner membrane-spanning anti-sigma factor. the alternative sigma factor, pvds, when associated with core rna polymerase, binds iron-starvation  box motifs  <cit>  and directs the expression of a suite of genes involved in the synthesis of pvd  <cit> . the activity of pvds is regulated by a transmembrane signaling system that comprises of fpvr and fpva, an outer membrane pvd receptor, and is primarily mediated by pvd  <cit> . more recently, a second ecf sigma factor  was found to direct transcription of fpva  <cit> . like pvds, fpvi is also under the direct regulation of fpvr and forms a second divergent branch of the signaling pathway.

many plant-associated pseudomonads are known to produce pvds, including the plant pathogen, p. syringae and the saprophytes, p. putida and p. fluorescens. the importance of siderophores for rhizosphere colonization by p. putida has been previously reported  <cit> . however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of pvd production and regulation in these organisms.

here we report a genetic characterization of genes for pvd production in a plant growth-promoting bacterium, pseudomonas fluorescens sbw <dig>  sbw <dig> was originally isolated from field-grown sugar beet  <cit>  and its biocontrol activity against the soil-borne pathogen, pythium ultimum, is related to its considerable plant colonization ability  <cit> . the present investigation was prompted by initial findings that three genes implicated in iron-acquisition processes were up-regulated on plant surfaces, as revealed by in vivo expression technology  analysis  <cit> . two genes had significant homology to putative siderophore receptor genes, and one gene appeared to be homologous to pao <dig> pvdl, which encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  involved in pvd biosynthesis  <cit> . these findings suggested a significant role for iron uptake during seedling colonization.

our work began with the un-annotated whole genome sequence of sbw <dig>  <cit> . based initially on an analysis of this sequence,  <dig> genes were identified with predicted roles in pvd biosynthesis, transport and regulation, for which the regulation of a subset of these was investigated by genetic analysis using chromosomally-integrated 'lacz fusions and gene expression constructs. the results indicate a not previously realized mechanism of fpvr regulation. moreover, we determine the chemical structure of sbw <dig> pvd and examine the biological role of pvd via a siderophore-deficient mutant. the ability of sbw <dig> to utilize a panel of structurally distinct exogenous pvds was also assessed.

RESULTS
genomic analysis of pvd genes in p. fluorescens sbw25
interrogation of the complete genome sequence of sbw <dig> using genes known to be involved in pvd-mediated iron acquisition in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit>  revealed  <dig> homologues with predicted roles in pvd biosynthesis, transport and regulation. the results are summarized in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

sbw <dig> homologues were identified for all pao <dig> pvd genes except pa <dig>  which encodes a thioesterase, and pvdj and pvdd, which encode nrpss involved in biosynthesis of the pvd peptide backbone. in pao <dig>  pa <dig> is not essential for pvd production, and is possibly redundant since pvdg also encodes a thioesterase  <cit> . although homologues of pvdj and pvdd were not identified in sbw <dig>  three additional nrps genes were identified: two downstream of pvdp  and one downstream of pvdi . differences in the sequences and organization of these nrps genes likely reflect differences between the structures of the pvds produced by sbw <dig> and pao <dig> .

the pvd genes of sbw <dig> are distributed across seven different loci within the genome , which is the most widespread distribution of pvd genes in a genomic comparison among four various sequenced pseudomonas spp.  <cit> . this distribution is in stark contrast to that of p. syringae where pvd genes form one large cluster  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> the pvd genes are confined to two loci separated by just  <dig>  kb , which appears to be typical of p. aeruginosa isolates in general, where almost all pvd genes are located within the same region of the genome  <cit> . pvd gene homologues in p. putida kt <dig> and p. fluorescens strains pf0– <dig>  <cit>  and pf- <dig>  <cit>  are distributed across three loci.

despite the overall differences in the genomic organization of pvd genes between sbw <dig> and pao <dig>  genes within each of the seven sbw <dig> pvd clusters are largely syntenous with those in pao <dig>  there are, however, two exceptions: pvdq and fpvr, which in sbw <dig> are found in two non-adjacent regions of the genome and separated from all other pvd genes. the isolated position of fpvr , is particularly unusual: the genes for ecf sigma factors and their cognate anti-sigma factors are typically adjacent, and usually co-regulated by fur  <cit> . the gene arrangement in sbw <dig> suggests that fpvr and fpvi might be under separate regulatory control – a notion given credibility by the fact that the promoter sequence of fpvr in sbw <dig> does not have a recognizable fur-box motif. interestingly, in place of the expected fur-box motif is an is-box motif, albeit one in which the last three bases of the consensus sequence are in reverse order . the possibility that in sbw <dig> fpvr might be regulated by pvds led to further investigation .

expression of putative pvd genes in response to iron starvation
to ascertain whether the sbw <dig> pvd gene homologues identified by in silico analyses are responsive to iron, a selection of genes were assessed using chromosomally integrated 'lacz transcriptional fusions. genes were chosen that represented key regulatory and structural components in pvd mediated iron-uptake, and included the ecf sigma factor encoding genes pvds and fpvi, the anti-sigma factor encoding gene fpvr, and structural genes involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of pvd, pvdl and fpva, respectively . the β-galactosidase activity of each fusion strain was assessed under high iron , moderate iron , and low iron  conditions. all gene fusions showed decreasing levels of activity as iron concentration was increased , which is consistent with genes that are directly or indirectly under the control of the fur repressor. the most active gene tested was fpva, the activity of which was almost 3-fold greater than the next most active gene, pvds.

a the 'lacz fusion reporter was integrated into the pvd locus by insertion-duplication thus the gene function was not affected.

to determine whether sbw <dig> possesses a branched fpv signaling pathway analogous to that in pao <dig>  <cit> , the effects of the two constitutively expressed ecf sigma factors  and the anti-sigma factor  on downstream structural genes  were assessed. expression constructs  were created in the vector pbroadgate which resulted in the cloned genes coming under the control of the constitutive plac promoter. the expression constructs, and corresponding control vector, pbroadgate-d, were introduced into the pvdl-'lacz  and fpva-'lacz  fusion strains, and their activities were monitored in β-galactosidase assays under high and low iron regimes in caa medium. expression of pvdl and fpva was significantly increased as a consequence of constitutive expression of pvds and fpvi, respectively , consistent with the notion that pvds and fpvi are alternative ecf sigma factors that direct regulation of each of these genes. in both cases, an increase in expression was observed even in the presence of iron, consistent with fur-independent regulation of the cloned regulators. furthermore, expression of fpvr caused a significant decrease in the level of fpva expression, consistent with fpvr being an anti-sigma factor in the fpv signaling pathway model  <cit> . for pvdl, repression by fpvr was observed under high iron conditions, though not to a statistically significant level. thus to verify the presence of the fpv branched signaling pathway in sbw <dig>  pvd induction of the pathway was demonstrated by providing purified sbw <dig> pvd to the pvdl-'lacz and fpva-'lacz fusion strains. here, the exogenous pvd stimulated the signaling pathway, resulting in significant up-regulation of both pvdl  and fpva . taken together, these data are consistent with sbw <dig> possessing a branched fpv signaling pathway that is activated by pvd.

unique regulation of fpvr in sbw25
next we tested the hypothesis that fpvr is regulated by pvds rather than fur, which is the direct regulator of anti-sigma factors in many other bacterial iron-acquisition systems  <cit> . the regulatory gene constitutive expression constructs  were introduced into the fpvr-'lacz fusion strain . β-galactosidase activities of the resulting strains were determined under high  and low  iron regimes. contrary to expectation, the results presented in figure 3c showed that expression of fpvi, and not pvds, resulted in the up-regulation of fpvr, even in the presence of iron. it is unknown whether fpvi directly regulates fpvr, or if an intermediate regulatory component is involved. however, a conserved sequence motif, 5'-taatgagaa-3', was identified  <dig> nt upstream of fpva and  <dig> nt upstream of fpvr, which may potentially serve as an fpvi binding site.

genomic comparisons suggest that the non-adjacent arrangement of fpvi and fpvr in sbw <dig> may not be unique. homologues of fpvr were not reported in p. putida kt <dig> and p. fluorescens pf0– <dig>  and fpvr and fpvi were not identified in p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  <cit> , however, this is likely to reflect a lack of strong sequence homology to the characterized counterparts in pao <dig>  indeed, in sbw <dig>  the amino acid sequence identity between fpvr and its pao <dig> homologue was the lowest among all genes examined . a search for fpvr genes in other sequenced p. fluorescens strains revealed putative homologues in pf0– <dig> and pf- <dig> , however neither gene was adjacent to its cognate fpvi homologue, nor possessed a recognizable fur-box motif in the upstream sequence. a putative is-box was observed  <dig> bp upstream of the pf0– <dig> homologue, with  <dig> out of  <dig> bases matching the is-box consensus. however, an is-box was not observed for the pf- <dig> homologue, nor was the potential fpvi-binding site sequence identified upstream of sbw <dig> fpva and fpvr. the presence of key genes encoding components of the fpv branched signaling pathway  in the pf0– <dig> and pf- <dig> genomes suggests that this pathway may be conserved in these p. fluorescens strains – a hypothesis that can be tested in future work.

deletion analysis of pvdl
to investigate the biological roles of the pvd genes predicted from in silico analysis, an sbw <dig> derivative strain containing a deletion of pvdl was constructed . in sbw <dig>  pvdl  is predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid nrps involved in pvd chromophore biosynthesis. pbr <dig> displayed a pvd negative phenotype when grown on lb agar: wild-type sbw <dig> produced a typical yellow-green siderophore, whereas pbr <dig> did not . it was also observed that colonies of pbr <dig> were notably smaller than those of sbw <dig> . it is unknown whether this is solely due to impairment in iron uptake, or whether an iron-independent factor negatively affects pbr <dig> growth.

the growth kinetics of pbr <dig> were determined in iron-limited caa broth and the same medium supplemented with  <dig> μm fecl <dig> in microtitre plate cultures. results are shown in figure 4b. a repeated measures manova  showed that the optical density of pbr <dig> cells was significantly reduced compared to wild-type in iron deplete medium from  <dig> h . no significant reduction was detected during exponential growth, for example, at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, p values were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. no significant difference in growth was observed between wild-type and pbr <dig> in iron replete medium .

growth analysis of pbr <dig> took place initially in  <dig> μl microtitre plate cultures, which although incubated with periodic shaking, could have become oxygen limited thus masking the effect of the pvdl mutation during exponential growth. to test this hypothesis, growth of pbr <dig> and sbw <dig> was further investigated using strongly aerated cultures grown in caa broth, where iron is more likely to be present in the ferric form. the growth dynamics  were comparable to those observed in the static cultures, with no statistical difference in cell density being detected during exponential growth, however differences in final yield were evident at  <dig> hours , and for sbw <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ). furthermore, pbr <dig> was incapable of growing in caa medium supplemented with the strong iron-chelator eddha , whereas growth was restored upon provision of purified sbw <dig> pvd . taken together, the data confirmed the predicted role of pvdl  in pvd production.

structural analysis of sbw <dig> pvd
the chemical structure of sbw <dig> pvd was determined by mass spectral analysis using standard methods as previously described  <cit> . comparison of the mass spectra to published data  <cit>  revealed that sbw <dig> pvd comprises the characteristic pvd quinoline chromophore  <cit>  linked to a partly cyclic seven residue peptide backbone, identical to that of p. fluorescens atcc  <dig>  <cit> : ser-lys-gly-fohorn-c  . the side chain that is connected amidically to the nh2-group of the chromophore varied as succinic acid or ketoglutaric acid. the peptide backbone sequence differs in length and composition to that of pao <dig> pvd   <cit> ). in silico analyses  <cit>  of the protein sequences of the putative pvd nrpss: pvdi, pflu <dig>  pflu <dig>  pflu <dig> and pvdl, were performed to predict their amino acid substrates . comparison of the substrate predictions with the actual pvd structure suggested that only pvdi and pflu <dig> are involved in the biosynthesis of the sbw <dig> pvd backbone, with predictions for three of the amino acid residues being correct . dhb/sal-like residues were consistently predicted for both occurrences of fohorn for pvdi and pflu <dig> . it is unclear why the algorithm has made this prediction, as fohorn does not share similar physico-chemical properties with dhb and sal, however, similar analyses of the pao <dig> pvd nrpss have also consistently predicted dhb/sal-like specificities for the fohorn binding modules . the roles of pflu <dig> and pflu <dig> are presently unknown, however the presence of an is-box-like motif preceding these genes, and their proximity to other pvd gene homologues  suggests that they have, or have had, a role in pvd-mediated iron-uptake processes. as the sbw <dig> pvd chromophore structure is identical to that of pao <dig> pvd  <cit> , it was not surprising that the in silico substrate predictions for sbw <dig> pvdl were the same as those for pao <dig> pvdl , although only one of the three residues was predicted correctly  in each case.

utilization of exogenous pvds by p. fluorescens sbw25
the identification of two sbw <dig> plant-induced genes with homology to siderophore receptor genes  <cit>  prompted us to examine the ability of sbw <dig> to uptake and utilize exogenous siderophores. initially, a genome-wide search for putative tonb-dependent siderophore receptor genes was undertaken, which revealed  <dig> putative siderophore receptor genes dispersed throughout the genome . nine of these were immediately adjacent to predicted sigma factor/anti-sigma factor gene pairs , that are presumably involved in their regulation. the number of putative receptor genes is similar to that  for p. fluorescens pf0– <dig>  <cit> , and include fpva , and pflu <dig> and pflu <dig> which were both previously shown to be induced in planta  <cit> . these results strongly support the notion that sbw <dig> has the capability to utilize a considerable number of exogenous iron-chelating siderophores produced by other microbes.

to test the ability of sbw <dig> to utilize exogenous pvds, pvds purified from  <dig> different pseudomonas isolates , each with a different siderotype profile , were supplied to 15f <dig>  that had been overlaid as a dilute suspension onto caa medium chelated with eddha. the mutant was unable to grow when water was provided as a negative control. however, growth was restored by provision of pvds purified from  <dig> different isolates . these include the three types  of pvd from p. aeruginosa. thus, it is apparent that sbw <dig> is able to utilize a range of exogenous pvds produced by other pseudomonads.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomic era has revolutionized the scientific method of comparative biology, where the general applicability of biological traits and systems that have often been evaluated in few model organisms may now be readily assessed across taxa. although pvds are common siderophores of pseudomonas spp., the regulation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of pvd has been elucidated almost exclusively in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the availability of the p. fluorescens sbw <dig> genome sequence has revealed that pvd genes are considerably more widespread throughout the sbw <dig> genome than in other sequenced pseudomonads, and has enabled a comparative analysis of pvd regulation in sbw <dig> and pao <dig> to be undertaken. the pvd regulatory model established for pao <dig> involves a unique branched signaling pathway  <cit> . prior to this study it was not known whether this model applies to other pseudomonas isolates. using chromosomally-integrated gene reporter fusions and gene expression constructs, we found that the pao <dig> branched signaling model is present in sbw <dig>  in addition, we reveal a significant difference between pao <dig> and sbw <dig> in terms of the regulation of fpvr. in sbw <dig>  over-expression of fpvi results in constitutive expression of fpvr, suggesting that fpvr is positively regulated by fpvi, rather than directly by fur, as is the case of fpvr of pao <dig>  <cit> . the structure of sbw <dig> pvd was elucidated and it was found that the peptide backbone is identical to that of p. fluorescens atcc  <dig>  comprising a partly cyclic peptide of seven residues. the pvd structure implicated the involvement of two nrpss in the synthesis of the pvd peptide backbone. the sbw <dig> genome harbors  <dig> putative tonb-dependent siderophore receptors, two of which are previously shown to be plant-inducible  <cit> . exogenous pvd uptake assays demonstrate that sbw <dig> is able to utilize a variety of structurally distinct siderophores produced by other pseudomonas isolates. these data lay the foundation for further detailed functional analysis of these putative siderophore receptors in term of regulation and transporter specificity.
