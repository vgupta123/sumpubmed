BACKGROUND
genomic resources and information about primates are valuable for evolutionary and biomedical studies to determine how and why phenotypes specific to humans, as well as human diseases, have been formed. moreover, they are important for extrapolating the results of laboratory experiments to medical research because the physiology of primates is more similar to that of humans as compared with other common experimental animals such as rodents. the cynomolgus macaque , also known as the long-tailed or crab-eating macaque, is an old world monkey living in southeast asia. it is bred in laboratories worldwide and is one of the most popular primates used for laboratory animal studies, such as those on infectious diseases, immunology, pharmacology, tissue engineering, gene therapy, senescence, and learning  <cit> . cynomolgus macaques, rhesus macaques , and japanese macaques  are widely used for experimental studies and are closely related to each other  <cit> . the us government funded genome sequencing of the rhesus macaque because it is the most common laboratory animal bred in the us, and in  <dig>  the draft sequence of the rhesus macaque was published  <cit> .

since cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys are very closely related at the genetic level, we aim to determine the extent to which the rhesus macaque genome sequence can be used as a reference for biomedical studies involving cynomolgus macaques. at the chromosomal level, a previous study suggested that a pericentric chromosome inversion occurred in the cynomolgus lineage after splitting from rhesus macaques  <cit> . at the nucleotide sequence level, the genetic divergence between cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys has been measured using mitochondrial dna sequences  <cit>  or a limited number of loci on the chromosomes  <cit> . thus, the divergence of a sufficient number of loci between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques would assist in determining the degree of genetic divergence between them. in addition, recent studies have shown that there is a considerable amount of genetic diversity within the species themselves  <cit> , which also hampers the measurement of the genetic divergence. because the divergence between the two macaques is very recent , we must consider the segregation of polymorphisms in the common ancestral population to estimate the correct species divergence time  <cit> . by analyzing the number of loci in the two species, we can determine the history of divergence between them, including the ancestral population size, divergence time between species, and possible gene flow  <cit> .

we have constructed full-length-enriched cdna libraries from cynomolgus monkey brain, testis, and liver using the oligo-capping method. many comparative genomics projects have focused on sequencing of the genome or expressed sequenced tags , and full-length cdna sequences are uniquely informative resources for accurately predicting the full structure of transcripts in the genome  <cit> . furthermore, because cynomolgus and rhesus macaques are very closely related, transcriptome data from cynomolgus macaques is useful for annotating the genome sequence of other macaques whose transcriptome data is less than 1% of that from humans and whose full-length cdna data is scarce.

along with the cynomolgus macaque cdna sequencing project, we have published a part of our results, such as novel gene findings  <cit> , search for fast-evolving genes  <cit> , molecular evolution of 5'-untranslated regions   <cit> , and evolution of brain-expressed genes  <cit> . in this study, we summarize the final sequencing project and present novel findings with an expanded dataset. in total,  <dig>  ests and  <dig> full-length sequences were determined, annotated, and stored in an in-house database and the public databases . our study focused on the divergence between the cynomolgus and rhesus macaque genes. we did not intensively analyze the divergence between humans and cynomolgus monkeys, because a study on rhesus genome has investigated this thoroughly  <cit> ; it also identified and discussed positively selected genes or extensively duplicated genomic regions during the evolution of catarrhine primates.

RESULTS
summary of cdna sequences
we constructed several oligo-capped cdna libraries from cynomolgus monkey testis, liver, and seven anatomical parts of the brain . the oligo-capping method selectively amplifies full-length cdnas with a cap structure and poly tail  <cit> . we sequenced the 5'- or 3'-end of  <dig>  clones, yielding  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences of 5'- and 3'-ests, respectively, after filtering the vector and low quality sequences. these est sequences grouped into  <dig>  clusters with  <dig>  singletons . we classified them based on homology to the  <dig>  non-redundant human refseq sequences . of the  <dig>  est sequences,  <dig>   were homologous to the human refseq gene set and were clustered into  <dig> types of genes, indicating that our est sequences would cover about 34% of the known human transcripts . in particular, when we limited the human reference genes to the validated protein-coding genes , 47% of the human reference genes were represented in the macaque cdnas.

*numbers of genes with the refseq homologs are shown in parentheses.

in parallel to est sequencing, we determined about  <dig> full-insert sequences of the cdna clones. about  <dig> clones whose 5'-est sequences were not homologous to the public cdna sequences and  <dig> clones whose 5'-est sequences were homologous to the human refseq sequences were chosen  <cit> . out of the  <dig> full-insert sequences,  <dig> sequences were homologous to  <dig> types of human genes . the averaged length of the full-insert sequences was  <dig> bp, excluding the length of the poly tail. the macaque sequences were annotated for gene function and homologous locus in the human genome using information from the entrez gene  <cit>  and gene ontology  databases  <cit> .

database construction
all cdna sequences and annotations were deposited in the public databases and stored in a simple in-house database, qfbase  <cit> . on the qfbase website, users can search the macaque clones by keywords and blast searches. for each human gene, the distribution of the macaque homologs is represented graphically and users can easily retrieve information of the objective macaque cdna clones. the entries are further linked to the gene annotation in the outside databases, genbank  <cit> , ensembl  <cit> , omim  <cit> , and h-invdb  <cit> . the cdna sequences were mapped on the human and rhesus genome sequences using the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> human-macaque orthologous alignments are provided in the qfbase. for each alignment, the non-synonymous substitution rate  and the synonymous substitution rate  between the human and macaque cdna sequences were estimated. non-synonymous substitutions are nucleotide changes that replace amino acids between species whereas synonymous substitutions cause no amino acid changes. the relative pace of protein evolution was thus determined using ka/ks, assuming that the ks value reflects the neutral mutation rate  <cit> . using the database, users can sort the alignments according to the ka and ks values. for example, users can determine the ka and ks values of a particular gene or view the list of the  <dig> most rapidly evolved genes between humans and cynomolgus monkeys. the cdna clones are distributed through the human science research resource bank in japan . further information is available at the qfbase website.

analysis of unidentified transcripts
of the  <dig> full-sequenced cdnas, about  <dig> were not homologous to the human reference gene sequences . these non-refseq transcripts clustered into  <dig> non-redundant transcripts, which were further classified as shown in figure  <dig>  the list of the non-refseq transcripts is provided in additional file  <dig>  we filtered  <dig> junk sequences and  <dig> known transcripts. the  <dig> transcripts matched with the unannotated human cdna sequences in the database and were called as orphan transcripts. these may help in further annotation of the human genome.

after removing the junk sequences and orphan transcripts, the remaining  <dig> transcripts were referred as the unidentified transcripts although 40%  of the transcripts showed homology to human ests , because no full cdna sequence of humans has been registered in the public databases. one of the advantages of full-length cdnas is that we can determine the splicing pattern and reading direction of the transcripts in the genome. we categorized the unidentified transcripts as anti-transcript, intronic spliced transcript, intronic single-exon transcript, intergenic spliced transcript, or intergenic single-exon transcript. among the intergenic transcripts,  <dig> were located within  <dig> kb of the genic regions with the same direction as the genes. of these,  <dig> were mapped on the upstream regions and  <dig> were mapped on the downstream regions of the known genes. the result showed they may be hidden extensions of the known transcripts, using alternative promoters and/or poly signals in the human genome. these sequences were filtered from the intergenic transcripts and classified as 'flanking' to genic regions. the largest group was the intronic single-exon transcripts. although they might be acquired from premature mrna molecules in the cell nucleus, recent studies have revealed the potential abundance of short intronic transcripts in the human genome  <cit> . among these classes, anti-transcripts and intergenic spliced transcripts are the most biologically relevant classes, which are unlikely to be derived from contamination by premature mrnas.

we designed oligonucleotide microarrays  containing probes complementary to the known genes and unidentified transcripts. hybridizations were performed using the rna sampled from a 3-year-old macaque cerebrum, cerebellum, liver, and testis with duplications. the significance of expression was determined using affymetrix mas <dig>  software  <cit>  . the proportion of the expressed transcripts is presented in figure  <dig>  in the unidentified transcripts,  <dig> transcripts were expressed in at least one of the four tissues . because all the unidentified transcripts were isolated from the macaque brain or testis, fewer transcripts were expressed in the liver  than in the cerebrum , cerebellum , and testis . the expressed proportion of the unidentified transcripts was significantly smaller than that of  <dig> refseq homologs . the orphan transcripts were expressed in an intermediate proportion . the percentages of the expressed unidentified transcripts ranged from 33% to 57% . a large difference was observed between the intergenic and intronic transcripts; more intronic transcripts displayed significant expression on the microarrays than intergenic transcripts .

btranscripts that were mapped more than  <dig> kb away from the annotated genic regions on the human genome .

previous studies have shown that many unannotated transcripts are not conserved at a dna sequence level in many organisms  <cit> . in practice, sequence conservation is determined by investigating whether the region is alignable. here, we directly measure the difference in the dna sequences between humans and macaques. for protein-coding genes, previous studies have shown large disparities in sequence divergence between brain- and testis-expressed genes, both in the cds and utr, owing to the stronger functional constraint on the brain-expressed genes  <cit> . we further inquired whether the trend was observed in the unidentified transcripts. we classified the transcripts into brain-expressed transcripts  and testis-expressed transcripts . as shown in figure  <dig>  while the non-synonymous substitution rates of the refseq homologs were higher in the testis than in the brain, the dna sequence divergence of the unidentified transcripts was not associated with the expression pattern. furthermore, there was no evidence that the unidentified transcripts were more conserved than the synonymous sites of the refseq homologs.

we further evaluated the expression level of the  <dig> intergenic transcripts. we collected the strongest signal intensity of the significantly expressed intergenic transcripts. as shown in figure  <dig>  even if they were significantly expressed, signal intensities of the intergenic transcripts were significantly weaker than those of the control genes . weak expression levels of intergenic sequences have been previously reported  <cit>  and these may cause weak detection levels of the intergenic transcripts. to test the reproducibility of the microarray experiments using another method, we selected eight intergenic spliced transcripts and tried to amplify human and macaque transcripts using rt-pcr. we designed the pcr primers that would match both human and macaque sequences and would amplify introns of genomic sequences when the genomic dna is contaminated. a gel picture of the rt-pcr products is shown in figure  <dig>  two transcripts showed positive results, while six showed negative results on the microarray. we confirmed the expression of the two transcripts in the macaque brain using both the microarray and rt-pcr. furthermore, even though we failed to detect the expression of the six transcripts on the arrays, we recovered the expression of the two transcripts by rt-pcr. in these two transcripts, the expression levels detected by rt-pcr resulted in considerably weaker bands on the gel , indicating that the microarray failed to capture their expression at a very low level. in total, we detected the expression of four transcripts in the macaque brain. of these four transcripts, two were not detected and one was transcribed in an unspliced form in humans. the other showed multiple extra bands in both humans and macaques. overall, the expression of the macaque intergenic spliced transcripts was not well conserved between the human and the macaque brain.

hidden transcript structures in the human genome
of the  <dig> macaque cdna sequences,  <dig> covered the entire cds of the human refseq genes in a single blast hit chain. in the  <dig> cdnas, we sought a stretch of utr sequences  that did not match any homologous human cdna sequence. simple genomic insertion or deletion in the genome was not counted. after filtering the ambiguous entries, in the utr of macaque cdnas, we found  <dig> exons that were not found in the human cdna data. out of the  <dig> unidentified exons,  <dig>  did not match any human est sequence. we classified the unidentified utrs as follows:  extended exons and  novel exons . those unidentified exons were further classified into internal and external exons . as shown in figure  <dig>  the distribution of the different types of unidentified exons was not uniform; most of them were external exons.

because the human transcriptome data is more complex than previously thought, as revealed by genome tiling dna microarrays  <cit> , these unrepresented exons may be expressed at a very low level in human tissues. moreover, these exons have not been found in the conventional cdna exploration methods. however, previous studies have suggested a frequent evolutionary turnover of exon sequences  <cit> . the evolutionary alteration of external exons in the 5'-utr may be caused by the alternative usage of promoter sequences  <cit> . the evolutionarily altered exons in the 3'-utr may be caused by the alternative usage of poly adenylation signals  <cit> . all the unidentified exons are provided in additional file  <dig> 

comparison of the human, cynomolgus, and rhesus genes
we compiled  <dig> human-rhesus-cynomolgus cdna alignments  using the rhesus macaque genome and the predicted transcript sequences. the phylogenetic relationship among the three species is shown in figure  <dig>  because the rhesus and cynomolgus genomes are very similar, we wanted to minimize non-orthologous alignments, which inflate the average and variance of the nucleotide divergence between them. therefore, the macaque genes showing > 80% homology to more than one locus in the rhesus genome were filtered . although the number of genes analyzed was reduced to  <dig> in the second dataset, the subset of the genes would be useful in estimating the divergence among the three species. the results were obtained using dataset ii in the following manner. the results using the unfiltered dataset , which resulted in the inflation of variance, are provided in additional file  <dig>  genes that have evolved under positive selection were searched with the model-based likelihood ratio test  <cit> . in total,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes showed evidence of positive selection in the human, cynomolgus, and rhesus lineages, respectively . thirty-eight genes also showed a positive selection signature between the two macaques and  <dig> were detected in all the three lineages . note that, in figure  <dig>  the phylogenetic tree is unrooted. the list of positively selected genes is provided in additional file  <dig>  excluding the overlapped genes, we identified  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  that underwent positive selection in any lineage at 5% significance level. the number of positively selected genes in each of the two macaque lineages was comparable to that estimated in the human-chimpanzee lineages using the same method  <cit> . although these candidates of positively selected genes contain many biologically interesting functions, such as transcriptional regulation , visual perception , and mitochondrial localization   <cit> , none of the go categories were statistically overrepresented probably because of the small sample size.

genetic divergence between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques
using the above dataset, we estimated the nucleotide substitution rates of each lineage from the common ancestor of cynomolgus and rhesus macaques . numbers and rates of the non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions for each lineage were estimated using the maximum likelihood method. we assumed that synonymous substitutions are nearly neutral and used them to estimate the divergence time. if we set the divergence of humans and old world monkeys to 25– <dig> million years ago   <cit> , genes of the two macaques would be considered to diverge  <dig> – <dig>  mya on average. however, since the two species diverged very recently, we have to consider the ancestral polymorphisms segregating at the time of speciation  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the impact of the ancestral polymorphisms on the estimation of the divergence time. suppose that the common ancestor of two macaques had the same population size as the population size of extant chimpanzees, i.e., 1– <dig> mya to the most recent common ancestor  <cit> . in this situation, only one mya divergence is assigned to the actual divergence time of the two species. therefore, without considering ancestral polymorphisms, we tend to overestimate the true species divergence. we applied the maximum likelihood method to estimate the divergence time and ancestral population size of the rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. as a result, we obtained 2tu =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and 4neu =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  where t, ne, and u represent the divergence time after speciation, ancestral population size at speciation, and mutation rate with standard errors, respectively. we also noticed that a non-negligible number of nucleotide substitutions were erroneously assigned to the cynomolgus macaque lineage owing to pcr errors in the cdna libraries. therefore, the actual substitution rate was estimated by correcting the pcr error using a computational method . after the correction, we obtained 2tu =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and 4neu =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . if we consider u = 10- <dig> , the divergence time between the two macaques would be estimated as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya with a standard error. we also estimated the ancestral population size to be  <dig>  ±  <dig> with a mutation rate per generation of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> in humans  <cit> . the result suggests that more than a half of the genetic divergence between the two macaques is derived from the ancestral polymorphisms.

discussion
in summary, the sequencing project of cynomolgus monkey cdnas yielded  <dig>  ests and  <dig> full-length sequences. since our project mainly studied the brain and testis, the dataset is deficient in other tissue-specific genes, e.g., the genes related to the immune system that many medical researchers would want to explore  <cit> . the construction of cdna libraries from other tissues and est sequencing is still ongoing to complement the transcriptome of cynomolgus monkeys. the latest sequencing status can be confirmed from the website. because of the close relationship between the cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, cdna resources of cynomolgus macaques not only are useful for research using cynomolgus macaques but also complement the relative paucity of the transcriptome data from rhesus macaques. using macaque tissues to scan the primate transcriptome is advantageous because rna molecules are unstable and are instantly degraded in the tissues during sampling. this causes serious problems for rna sampling from human tissues, especially in the brain, where fresh samples are rarely obtainable. therefore, we hope to uncover rare transcripts that would be hidden in the human transcriptome data. in this study, we identified  <dig> macaque cdnas that were not represented in the public human cdna sequences. although 51% of the cdna did not show a positive signal on the microarrays, the following rt-pcr experiments recovered the expression in half  of the transcripts. the results indicate that these unidentified transcripts were expressed at a low level in the tissues even though the microarray could not detect the expression.

the m. fascicularis oligonucleotide microarrays contain probes that matched  <dig> known genes and  <dig> unidentified transcripts. we determined the number of probe sets for the known genes that overlapped among the commercially available microarray  and previously published microarray of rhesus macaque by wallace et al., which contains the largest number of probe sets among the published microarrays  <cit> . of our  <dig> probes for the known genes,  <dig>  were not represented in the commercial microarray and  <dig>  were not found in the published microarray. combining the three microarrays,  <dig> probes for the known genes were represented only in the m. fascicularis microarrays . in our preliminary study of the polymorphisms within cynomolgus macaques, we found that the level of polymorphisms in cynomolgus macaques was greater than that in rhesus macaques and slightly smaller than the level of divergence between rhesus and cynomolgus macaques . therefore, even if we should be careful about sequence mismatches within and between species, the information from both macaque transcripts and the rhesus genome can be combined to build more versatile and comprehensive dna microarrays that can be used for biomedical surveys using laboratory macaques.

suppose that we identify positively selected genes in the human lineage after the spilt from chimpanzees. such genes are useful for understanding the human-specific physiology only when those genes have not been under positive selection in other primate lineages. we identified  <dig> genes under positive selection between the two macaques at 5% significance level. none of these genes were shared with  <dig> genes under positive selection in the human or chimpanzee lineages previously determined from the whole genome scan  <cit> , providing support that the method has correctly identified positively selected genes in the specific lineages.

for estimating of the divergence time between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, we assumed that there is no gene flow between the ancestral species throughout their speciation and divergence time . however, considering the ancestral polymorphisms and the pcr error rate, we estimated the divergence time to be around  <dig>  mya, which is less than the estimation of the age of mrca of rhesus macaques  <cit> . indeed, more than half of the genetic divergence between the two macaques was derived from ancestral polymorphisms. if continuous gene flow is present during speciation, the variance component would be inflated and we would tend to overestimate the amount of ancestral polymorphisms  <cit> .

in this analysis, we used the rhesus macaque genome sequence to represent rhesus macaques. we should note that the rhesus macaque used for genome sequencing was an indian rhesus macaque; these macaques have genetically differentiated from chinese rhesus macaques  <cit> . in addition, our samples of cynomolgus macaques were obtained from different geographic subpopulations. previous studies using mitochondrial dna sequences  <cit>  and our preliminary analysis using nuclear dna sequences  showed that there is a substantial genetic divergence between cynomolgus monkeys of sundaland  and philippine populations. therefore, our phylogenetic inference using two sampled sequences has a technical limitation and may be accurate only if there are no complex population structures among the ancestral cynomolgus and rhesus macaque populations. elucidating the polymorphisms and divergence among macaque species would provide further insight into the evolutionary history of macaques and benefit biomedical research using macaque monkeys.

in table  <dig>  without correcting the pcr error rate, both the non-synonymous and synonymous divergences are greater in the cynomolgus lineage. this may be due to shorter generation time and smaller population size of cynomolgus monkeys. however, a more reasonable explanation is that the cdna sequences of cynomolgus monkeys might incorporate the errors resulting from pcr amplification during the construction of the oligo-capped cdna libraries. the synonymous substitution rate in the cynomolgus lineage is about  <dig>  points higher than that in the rhesus lineage, and the non-synonymous substitution rate differs in about  <dig>  points. assuming that the selective constraint and generation time of the two macaque lineages are the same, excess divergence of  <dig> %- <dig> % in the cynomolgus lineage may be an artifact introduced by pcr amplification, which is fairly close to the estimation from the experiment by suzuki and sugano  <cit> . if we reflect the substitution rate in the rhesus lineage to that in the cynomolgus lineage for correcting the errors, the total divergence of the two macaques will be reduced to about 90% .

CONCLUSIONS
transcript data from old world monkeys provide us with means to determine not only the evolutionary difference between human and non-human primates but also the hidden transcripts in the human genome. actual cdna clones of macaques are also indispensable resources for genetic engineering studies. it is considered that the species divergence between rhesus and cynomolgus macaques would be much later than the previous estimates, and the speciation process between them might have been complex. to use laboratory macaques more efficiently, we need to be more aware of the genetic difference within and among macaque monkeys. increasing the genomic resources and information of macaque monkeys will greatly contribute to the development of evolutionary biology and biomedical sciences.
