BACKGROUND
a bottleneck in x-ray crystallography-based structural genomics projects of integral membrane proteins  is obtaining diffracting crystals of the imps. the difficulties associated with the purification and crystallization of these molecules have caused crystallographic studies of imps to lag  <dig> years behind those of water-soluble proteins  <cit> . today, there are over  <dig>  structure entries for water-soluble proteins deposited in the public protein data bank  <cit> , in contrast to fewer than  <dig> imp entries . this discrepancy is largely due to the fact that the crystal structure determination of an imp is often experimentally hampered by difficulties associated with its heterologous expression, solubilization by detergents, purification, and crystallization  <cit> . recent advances in high-throughput  technologies enable us to partly overcome these difficulties through the application of genomic approaches. for instance, an efficient fusion system  <cit>  allows the screening of a large number of related or homologous targets to find those that overexpress and behave well for further characterization. the characterization of imp behavior in different detergents includes many important factors, such as functional activity, homogeneity and stability. while the characterization of a particular imp's functional activity  cannot be generalized, the quantification of the detergents and their effects on the homogeneity of the protein-detergent complex  can be standardized, and are thus the focus of this paper. extensive characterization of the pdc while screening for suitable detergents is inevitably time-consuming. however, failing to monitor detergent exchange or to control the detergent-to-protein ratio in the course of membrane solubilization and protein purification often results in inconsistent sample preparations and uncertainty of the pdcs' structural homogeneity. therefore, we sought an effective and relatively fast means to characterize pdcs, which could be applied in combination with genomic strategies.

we chose nmr spectroscopy to monitor the composition of detergents in the detergent-containing samples. nmr, unlike other methods for determining detergent concentration, such as refractive index  <cit> , fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy  <cit> , and thin layer chromatography  <cit> , offers the advantage of confirming the chemical identity unambiguously while simultaneously quantifying the components in the sample. furthermore, establishing the oligomeric homogeneity of a pdc is an important step before carrying out extensive crystallization screening of the target protein  <cit> . there are several analytical techniques that can be used to measure sample homogeneity, such as analytical ultracentrifugation  <cit>  and static light scattering/refractive index measurements coupled with size exclusion chromatography  <cit> . here, we used the traditional analytical ultracentrifugation method, adapting it to our purpose of monitoring sample homogeneity while simultaneously providing a rough estimate of the oligomeric state and the detergent-to-protein ratio of a sample in a quick and simple experiment.

by applying these two analytical methods, it is possible to quickly establish the optimum detergent concentration during imp extraction from the membrane, to control its subsequent exchange into alternate detergents, to monitor the detergent content during the processes of purification and concentration of the protein sample, and to evaluate its oligomeric homogeneity. we find that the ability of a detergent to solubilize an imp is dependent not only on protein identity but also on its expression level.

RESULTS
step 1: protein extraction from cell membranes
following protein expression in escherichia coli , a crude membrane fraction  containing an overexpressed imp is solubilized by a detergent of choice as the first step of imp purification. to screen for the optimal detergent for protein extraction from the cell membrane, we used nine detergents belonging to three different classes: non-ionic, zwitterionic and anionic . these detergents were used individually to extract the test protein, qsec, a histidine kinase receptor from e. coli, by incubating the crude membrane fraction overnight in a detergent-containing buffer. attempting to ensure sufficient solubilizing power of the extraction buffer, we used a detergent concentration of at least  <dig> times the critical micelle concentration  or  <dig>  mm micellar concentration, whichever was higher. the micellar concentration is defined here as the molar concentration of the detergent divided by its aggregation number. the detergent-solubilized fraction was then separated from insoluble material by centrifugation at  <dig>  g , the supernatant of which was then analyzed by sds-page .

a – in h2o, if otherwise is not specified; b – from  <cit>  or calculated according to  <cit> ; c – detergents used for extraction screen are in bold font; d – averaged values used in calculations; e –  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl; f – estimated value; g – ph  <dig> ; h –  <dig> mm tes, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig>  mm cacl2

we measured the actual concentration of the detergent in the starting extraction buffer as well as in the detergent-solubilized fraction by nmr spectroscopy in order to calculate a detergent retention ratio. the ratio is defined as the concentration of the detergent in the high speed spin supernatant fraction to that in the initial extraction buffer. to derive the accurate quantity of the detergent, we used the integral intensity of signature 1h-signals in nmr spectra established for the ten detergents in this study  calibrated against a standard  at a known concentration. results were crosschecked by measuring integrals of the several 1h-signals of the detergent . the detergent molar concentration in pdc samples is usually at least  <dig> times the protein molar concentration. hence the impact of the overlapping protein signals on calculated detergent concentration is within the margin of experimental error , estimated to be less than 5%.

a – approximate lower limit of measurable concentration for the samples in 10–20% d2o, measured using varian nmr system  <dig> mhz, probe sensitivity 1: <dig>   <dig> scans.

b –  <dig> × 10- <dig> mm in 100% d2o.

c – the chemical shifts of these signals are ph- and concentration-dependent.

in order to determine if the depletion of a detergent is due to binding with qsec itself, which is present in large quantities in the crude membrane fraction, or to the natural lipid membrane of e. coli, we performed control measurements on the membrane extract from the same amount of uninduced cells. in the absence of an overexpressed imp, none of the detergents was significantly depleted by high-speed centrifugation. this clearly indicates that detergent depletion is primarily due to the presence of large amounts of qsec expressed in the membrane rather than an inability to completely solubilize the lipid membrane. thus it seems most reasonable to surmise that fc <dig> did bind to qsec but that the protein remained insoluble and that these pdc aggregates were pelleted by the high-speed spin .

since the depletion of fc <dig> by qsec was particularly pronounced, we increased the concentration of fc <dig> incrementally to test if there was a threshold concentration that would be sufficient to extract qsec. in the same manner we also tested a group ii detergent – zw- <dig>  – and two efficient extractors – sds and dph. figure  <dig> shows that the increasing amount of qsec extracted by fc <dig> is strongly correlated with the increasing detergent retention ratio. the same threshold behavior is also evident for zw- <dig> , dph, and sds, as well as for fc <dig> when it was used to extract another imp . kvpae was fully extractable by fc <dig> , however the maximum extraction efficiency was reached at a lower concentration, displaying a threshold concentration approximately 4–5-times lower than that observed for qsec. this correlates well with the expression level of kvpae, which was roughly  <dig> times lower than that of qsec.

these data furnish an important guideline for choosing a detergent and its concentration for protein extraction from the membrane. in the given example, group i detergents are inadequate for qsec extraction from the membrane despite their high retention ratios . on the other hand, the concentration of detergents that either display some extraction potential by sds-page or have very low retention ratios  must be adjusted so that their retention ratio is ~ <dig>  . using these guidelines, we have overexpressed every e.coli receptor-kinase, adjusting the concentration of the detergent for the most efficient extraction . for other classes of imps one must first establish the detergent extraction profile and then adjust the concentration of the detergent to achieve a retention ratio close to  <dig> .

we showed that the threshold and optimum extraction concentration of a detergent depends on the identity and expression level of the protein. in the course of membrane solubilization, detergents compete against lipid molecules in the membrane to encircle imp molecules. detergents with a high specific affinity for the protein will have preferential binding to the protein embedded in the membrane, destabilizing the protein-lipid interaction. however, to break the protein-lipid contacts and solubilize an imp, the ratio of detergent to protein has to exceed a certain threshold. this threshold depends not only on the affinity of the detergent to a given protein but also on the concentration of the protein in the membrane. the ability to easily measure the optimal concentration of detergent by nmr for a given system allows for an efficient imp extraction using a minimum amount of what is often an expensive detergent.

step 2: detergent exchange
during the course of an imp preparation, it is often necessary to change the detergent of the pdc. the question of how efficient it is to exchange one detergent for another, especially for a less hydrophobic one, is often left unasked, yielding mixed results at the detergent exchange step. to answer this question, we carried out a detergent exchange of fc <dig>  which was originally used to extract etk , for less hydrophobic detergents: ddm, dm, ng and og, while monitoring detergent concentrations in all samples. because the recombinant etk contains an octa-histidine tag, we performed detergent exchange while etk, extracted by  <dig> mm of fc <dig>  was immobilized on a ni-nta column and washed with several column volumes of the destination detergent followed by elution with  <dig> mm imidazole in the destination detergent. we monitored the concentrations of the extraction and destination detergents, as well as total protein concentration in the flow-through, wash, and elution fractions from the ni-nta column. micellar concentrations of fc <dig> and ddm are plotted together with protein concentration for each fraction in figure 3a and 3b. figure 3a shows that fc <dig> is not efficiently replaced by ddm even after washing with  <dig> column volumes of  <dig>  mm ddm. the second of the three 1-column volume elution fractions has a micellar concentration of fc <dig> that is still equal to the protein concentration , indicating an unsuccessful exchange of fc <dig> for ddm. however, when the concentration of ddm was increased to  <dig> mm during the wash, complete exchange of fc <dig> was achieved . before elution, the concentration of the destination detergent was reduced by additional washes  containing  <dig>  mm ddm. the complete exchange was confirmed by the integrals of the signature peaks of fc <dig> and ddm . the destination detergent dm also successfully replaced fc <dig> only when used at a higher concentration during the wash step. attempts to replace fc <dig> with the even less hydrophobic detergents, ng and og, caused protein precipitation. these results are the first quantitative data on detergent exchange that demonstrate the importance of an extensive wash with a high concentration of the destination detergent.

step 3: concentrating protein-detergent complexes 
protein concentrations on the order of  <dig>  mm are often employed for growing crystals and the most common technique for attaining reproducible protein concentrations is ultrafiltration. however, this technique often results in an unpredictable, concomitant increase in the protein-free micelle concentration, making protein crystallization less reproducible from preparation to preparation. some details of detergent behavior during imp concentration were recently reported  <cit>  for four popular detergents using amicon ultrafiltration devices with  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda molecular weight cutoff  membranes. we measured detergent concentrations in retained and flow-through fractions for ten detergents commonly used for protein purification and crystallization . we compared results from concentrating these detergents in amicon and vivaspin ultrafiltration devices with  <dig> and  <dig> kda mwcos. the initial detergent concentrations were set to levels commonly used in imp purification. all detergents are concentrated to some extent in both the amicon and vivaspin  <dig> kda cutoff concentrators , and, as expected, detergents that form larger micelles tend to be concentrated more than those forming smaller micelles.

a –  <cit> ; b – the sample was concentrated 10×; c –  <cit> ; d –  <cit> ; e –  <cit> ; f – our estimates; g –  <cit> ; h –  <cit> .

ideally, the concentration factor  should be independent of the starting concentration and the concentration fold, however, the process of filtering detergents is more complex. to address the discrepancy between our data and the data from  <cit> , we checked the effect of the starting concentration on the observed concentration factor for ldao. from the plot in figure  <dig> we conclude that the concentration factor for ldao increases linearly with its initial concentration. however, even for the same ultrafiltration device , at the same starting concentration , and with the same fold concentration  for ldao, there is still a significant difference between the concentration factors calculated from our data  and the data published in  <cit>  . to eliminate the possibility of an effect due to device to device variability we concentrated ldao using three devices of the same kind at two initial concentrations . we observe a variability of less than 20% within devices of the same manufacturer and membrane cutoff. therefore, it is likely that different factors such as ldao purity, temperature, or ph are at play.

it is not clear what causes the unexpected increase in the concentration factor with increasing initial concentration, but one possibility is the concentration-dependent equilibrium between micelles and detergent monomers.

nevertheless, the result stresses the importance of monitoring the detergent concentration in order to obtain reproducible pdc preparations, and that even the initial concentration of detergent and the fold concentration can impact the final detergent concentration. another important factor to keep in mind is the differences between the models of ultrafiltration devices. a comparison of the  <dig> kda mwco vivaspin and amicon devices revealed an interesting discrepancy. the vivaspin pes membrane is permeable for all but three tested detergents, however, the corresponding amicon device  is only permeable to ng and og , as if the  <dig> kda amicon membrane acted as a filter with the cutoff size for detergent micelles smaller than specified.

step 4: analysis of the homogeneity of the pdcs by analytical ultracentrifugation
the tanford and reynolds method was established to study pdcs by analytical ultracentrifugation  <cit> . the core of the method relies on adjusting the density of the solvent to eliminate the detergent's contribution to the buoyant mass of the pdc. specifically, the tanford equation states that:

 mb = mp· + md·, 

where mb is the buoyant mass of the pdc, mp and md are the protein and detergent masses, v¯p

to illustrate these methods we performed velocity sedimentation  <cit>  measurements on three constructs of two e. coli kinases after exchanging their extraction detergents for three popular detergents  and taking a simple measurement of the density of the sample . the velocity curves obtained for a histidine kinase receptor, envz, and a tyrosine kinase receptor, etk expressed as a mistic-fusion protein  <cit>  and etk-nm , were analyzed using the ultrascan software package  <cit>  and results are presented in table  <dig>  we can conclude from the results that despite the successful exchange of fc <dig> for ddm, envz is highly aggregated  and thus unsuitable for crystallization screening. this is also the case with envz solubilized in its extraction detergent, fc <dig> . however, envz in ddm exchanged from dph appears mostly homogeneous and most likely monomeric  and therefore suitable for crystallization trials. thus, this simple measurement quickly demonstrates a critical difference between two extraction detergents that are both able to efficiently extract envz from the membrane. the etk sample in ddm is most likely a mixture of the low-oligomeric-weight protein in pdc and some higher-order aggregates . exchanging extraction detergent for this protein with fc <dig> improved the ratio of the low-oligomeric-weight protein to the aggregates  and increased stability of this protein. this sample was further purified by size exclusion chromatography and has yielded lead conditions from crystallization screening.

* density of the sample was adjusted to the density of fc <dig> 

on the other hand, the analysis of etk-nm in fc <dig> showed predominantly monomeric protein . homogeneity of the sample was confirmed using hplc sizing chromatography, which displayed only one homogenous peak . to assess the consistency of the method and the necessity of the density adjustment by d2o for fc <dig> we collected data for two samples of etk-nm with and without adjustment. we found that the error of estimating mass for the unadjusted sample is less than 5% , which is acceptable for a crude estimation of the oligomeric state and saves time in experiment preparation.

CONCLUSIONS
the importance of monitoring the detergent content and homogeneity of the pdc during imp preparation is illustrated by the behavior of detergents during extraction  and detergent exchange . surprisingly, concentration efficiency depends not only on the initial concentration of the detergent , but also on the type of ultrafiltration membrane . it is generally accepted that structural homogeneity of a protein sample should be achieved before dedicating time to screening crystallization conditions and the velocity sedimentation provides a quick method to monitor sample homogeneity .

the development of ht technology in the era of genomics has yielded an enormous increase in speed and efficiency that arises from advances in automation, miniaturization of traditional technology and adaptation of new technologies. while cloning and expression strategies have been developed for many protein production platforms, the purification of proteins has not benefited equally from automation, mostly due to the uniqueness of each protein. imp purification adds yet another level of complexity in ht approaches. to standardize imp production, there is a need for sensitive, rapid assays to characterize the detergent content and homogeneity of pdcs. we demonstrate that simple 1h-nmr spectroscopic analyses of pdcs provide a sound basis to standardize the steps of protein extraction, detergent exchange, and pdc concentration. we also illustrate that single velocity sedimentation measurements in h2o using common sense physical constraints on the model provide sufficient data to roughly estimate the oligomeric state and detergent-to-protein ratio in pdcs, and to evaluate the size homogeneity of the sample prior to crystallization screening. these methods are available to many labs and can be streamlined since dozens of samples can be measured overnight on an nmr spectrometer equipped with a sample exchanger and up to  <dig> samples a day can be measured on a single analytical ultracentrifuge instrument.
