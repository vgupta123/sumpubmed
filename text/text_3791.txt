BACKGROUND
the bacterium helicobacter pylori infects the gastric mucosa of about half of the world's population, rendering it one of the most common bacterial infections in humans  <cit> . the infection is associated with low socioeconomic status and is usually acquired in early childhood  <cit> . in the absence of consistent and verified environmental reservoirs, the transmission is considered to occur primarily from person-to-person. infected family members, especially mothers and siblings, are strong risk factors for children to be infected  <cit> . furthermore, clonal bacterial isolates have essentially only been identified in family members or the same person  <cit> . accordingly, intrafamilial transmission has been postulated as the predominant mode of h. pylori dissemination.

a hallmark of h. pylori is its ability to maintain an infection throughout the lifetime of an individual. the infection is accompanied by gastritis and, following persistent infection, a subset of infected individuals develops peptic ulcer or gastric cancer  <cit> . another distinguishing feature of the bacterium is its extensive genetic diversity, originating in acquisition, deletion, rearrangement and point mutation of dna sequences  <cit> . the diversity may facilitate adaptation to new hosts and persistence for decades despite a changing gastric milieu, consequently contributing to the high prevalence of the infection worldwide. thus, understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of h. pylori variability in a framework of transmission and host adaptation is a central and basic issue.

previous studies have described considerable whole-genome variability between unrelated isolates from different individuals  <cit>  and significantly less diversity of clonal isolates within the same individual  <cit> . the present study aimed, for the first time, to explore the genetic diversity of clonal isolates within and between members of a family by sequencing and comparative genomic microarray hybridizations in order to shed light on h. pylori transmission and host adaptation.

RESULTS
h. pylori isolates from the corpus sample of the mother  and the antrum samples of her three children  yielded similar patterns by rapd molecular typing  . the mother also harbored an additional strain in the antrum sample . at a later stage, a previously typed antrum sample from another biopsy of the mother was retrieved  <cit> , whereby a mixture of clones of rapd type a and b was identified.

2another antrum biopsy of the mother contained isolates of both rapd type a and b.

the clustering of the isolates was confirmed and clonal variants were identified by sequencing of five loci in three isolates per biopsy  . the rapd type a isolates typically contained the same alleles, which differed from those of the rapd type b isolates. the hsds <dig> sequences of type a isolates exhibited large differences compared to type b isolates and were aligned separately. the cag <dig>  primers did not yield any product for the type b isolates, but instead the hp0521b gene was detected. the hp0521b gene has been identified as a new gene at the site of cag <dig>  and is present in approximately half of swedish clinical isolates  <cit> . furthermore, the flab and muty products exhibited sequence variation between type a and type b isolates, but for the latter locus some of the divergence was shared between the type a isolates and the type b isolates of one child. all isolates yielded the same urei sequences except for a few nucleotide differences in two of the type b isolates of the mother.

sequence differences were assessed between  <dig> h. pylori isolates, three isolates from each of biopsy  <dig> and  <dig> from the mother and of biopsy  <dig>   <dig> and 24a from the three children.

1the  <dig> bp fragments from isolates from biopsy  <dig> differed significantly from the  <dig> bp fragments from the other isolates and were aligned separately.

2the  <dig> bp cag <dig>  fragments were obtained from isolates from biopsy  <dig>  while  <dig> bp fragments of the hp0521b gene were amplified from the other isolates, and separate alignments were performed.

the microarray data grouped the isolates in the same fashion as rapd and sequencing. the diversity as measured by microarray was assessed quantitatively for all  <dig> individual combinations of test isolates and relative to the reference strains  . of the  <dig>  genes analyzed, a mean number of  <dig> ±  <dig>   genes were classified as divergent in the  <dig> comparisons between the three isolates from the same biopsy. the diversity between type b isolates from different family members was estimated to a mean of  <dig> ±  <dig>   divergent genes in the  <dig> corresponding comparisons. in the  <dig> comparisons between isolates of type a  and type b , a mean of  <dig> ±  <dig>  genes were classified as divergent. the mean number of divergent genes for each of the  <dig> isolates relative to the reference strains was  <dig> ±  <dig> .

divergent genes were assessed by microarray for  <dig> h. pylori isolates, three isolates from each of biopsy  <dig> and  <dig> from the mother and of biopsy  <dig>   <dig> and 24a from the three children. isolates from the same biopsy were similar and the results are presented as the mean number of divergent genes by biopsy, averaged over comparisons between individual isolates.

the distributions of divergent genes over functional classes were nearly identical in assessments of variability of type a relative to type b isolates and of each isolate relative to the reference strains. the latter analysis did, however, yield higher estimates of variability within the functional classes, due to the overall higher frequency of divergent genes . the dna metabolism category had relatively high proportions of divergent genes for both analyses. this finding could be attributed to the subclass of restriction-modification genes , but also to genes involved in dna replication, recombination and repair . the cell envelope functional class also exhibited relatively high proportions of divergent genes. these divergent genes were primarily confined to a subclass designated "other", containing outer membrane proteins , and to genes involved in the biosynthesis of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides . an additional class that appeared variable was cellular processes, but this variability could not be attributed to specific subclasses. the majority of the genes classified as divergent had notably not been assigned a function . genes of functional categories involved in basic metabolic functions were relatively conserved. the low number of divergent genes among the type b isolates rendered an analysis by functional class uninformative.

divergent genes were assessed by microarray for  <dig> h. pylori isolates, three isolates of rapd type a  and  <dig> isolates of rapd type b . divergent genes by functional class were identified for the type a isolates relative to the type b isolates and for all isolates relative to the reference strains.

divergent genes were dispersed throughout the chromosome, but were concentrated in the two "plasticity zones", previously named after the particular presence of strain specific genes in the two sequenced strains  <cit> . indeed, a mean of  <dig> ±  <dig> of  <dig>  of the oligonucleotides deemed as divergent relative to the reference strains were also classified as specific for either  <dig> or j <dig>  all studied isolates were found to contain the cag pai by both microarray and pcr.

discussion
the present study of genome variability of h. pylori isolates from family members detected limited variability of clonal isolates within and between individuals. the clonal isolates have most likely been transmitted from person-to-person in the family  <cit> . we hypothesized that transmission and host adaptation may be associated with bacterial change by selection for fitter genetic variants. the limited variability identified for clonal isolates between the present family members does not support such change being considerable in terms of gene deletion, duplication or other substantial sequence difference.

this absence of support does, however, not disprove that transmission and host adaptation are associated with bacterial change. the modifications may be subtle, but nevertheless crucial, and not discernible by the present approach, and may act, possibly transiently, at other levels such as the transcriptome. the importance of subtle changes, for example phase-variation, is exemplified by how such modifications of lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic genes and outer membrane proteins may affect colonization efficiency in experimental models  <cit> . furthermore, vibrio cholerae, although likely to be a more infectious agent than h. pylori, may serve as a parallel since it has been proposed to enter a hyperinfectious state, characterized by the gene expression profile, during human infection  <cit> .

clonal variants were identified within individuals despite the overall low variability. h. pylori infection typically appears to be comprised of a predominant strain and strain variants  <cit> . the difference in genomic content among related isolates from the same individuals has been estimated to 0–2% by microarray analyses  <cit>  and 3% or less by sequencing  <cit> . the estimates above are in accordance with the present finding of a mean of  <dig> % divergent genes within individuals, considering that the microarray is not likely to contain all genes in the examined strains and that recombination between clonal isolates probably does not result in large sequence differences. a recent study reported no h. pylori genomic divergence in human volunteers that had been experimentally infected  <cit> . the authors proposed a study like the present to investigate the diversity of h. pylori populations during natural transmission. apparently, also our study is limited in this aspect due to the sparse genetic diversity detected.

the mother was found to harbor two clearly distinguishable strains, one of which was also isolated from the children. the finding of a strain in the mother not being detected in the children could be explained by the strain being less infectious  <cit> , by chance or by the strain remaining unsampled in the children. co-infections with distinct strains have been hypothesized to be more common in high- than in low-prevalence regions  <cit>  and can facilitate genetic diversification by recombination  <cit> . the muty sequences showed signs of a past recombination event between type a and type b strains, showing that these strains have encountered each other in at least one family member.

the genomic variability was most pronounced when measured relative to the reference strains, with a mean estimate of 18% divergent genes. this estimate is in accordance with previous microarray data of unrelated isolates from different individuals, where 12–18% of the genes were reported to be dispensable in each isolate  <cit>  and 22–32% were deemed as absent in at least one isolate  <cit> . in three sequenced h. pylori strains, 3–7% of the genes were specific to each strain  <cit> . the higher estimates above could be explained by strain-specific genes from two strains being included in the denominator, the same gene varying in sequence or a closer evolutionary relation between the sequenced strains.

the variability between different strains was associated with gene functional classes related to dna metabolism and the cell envelope. the diversity of genes involved in dna metabolism may reflect the importance of these systems in regulating the genetic diversity of h. pylori  <cit> . molecules on the bacterial surface are exposed to the host and may thus need to undergo antigenic variation in contrast to gene products involved in basic metabolism. this notion could explain the diversity found for genes encoding outer membrane proteins  <cit>  and for genes involved in biosynthesis of surface polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides  <cit> . moreover, the cellular processes functional class appeared variable as described before  <cit> . previously described plasticity zones in the sequenced strains were discernible in the present data  <cit> .

the limitations of the present study should be considered when interpreting the findings. first, detailed studies of human h. pylori isolates are, like ours, commonly restrained by a relatively sparse number of samples per person and time point with largely unknown representativeness. there are, however, no indications that the examined isolates would exhibit atypical properties. second, microarray hybridization will not detect variability in sequences not represented by the array, minor mutations or altered arrangements of genes on the chromosome. furthermore, some genes may have been misclassified as divergent or non-divergent. however, the evaluations of the microarray results point to that misclassification is unlikely to have influenced our conclusions significantly. the present conclusions are further based on patterns of variability over averaged comparisons between all isolates and are hence less prone to misinterpretation due to technical artifacts in the hybridizations of individual isolates. previous comparable studies have described approximately the same magnitude of variability  <cit> , concentrated to the same functional classes as observed in the present study  <cit> . this consistency corroborates the properness of the present data and thus also of this novel investigation of genome variability of clonal h. pylori isolates from family members by using microarray.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study does not support that transmission and host adaptation are associated with substantial sequence diversity in the h. pylori genome. however, important phenotypic modifications may be determined by undetected subtler genomic changes, such as phase-variation. the considerable variability between different strains is associated with gene functional classes related to dna metabolism and the cell envelope. these findings can aid further exploration of h. pylori genetic diversity and adaptation.
