BACKGROUND
venezuelan equine encephalitis virus  belongs to the alphavirus genus within the togaviridae family and was first isolated from horses in the end of the 1930s  <cit> . these viruses have a natural transmission cycle between rodents and mosquitos  <cit> . millions of horses were affected by this arbovirus with a fatality rate of up to 80% in epidemics in central and south america  <cit> .

several species of this family are pathogenic to humans and are recognized as potential biological warfare agent   <cit> . veev is classified as bioterrorism agent category b by the center of disease control . alphaviruses do not only have the potential for illness and transmission, but they can also be produced in large quantities and are moderately easy to disseminate. furthermore, these virus species have the capacity to cause human epidemics  <cit> . veev causes disease symptoms ranging from mild febrile reactions to fatal encephalitic zoonoses. outcomes are significantly worse for young and elderly patients, with case fatalities ranging from  <dig> to 35%  <cit> . these viruses are highly infectious as aerosols  <cit>  and an intentional release of sufficient quantities as inhalable small-particle aerosol is expected to infect a high percentage of individuals within an area of a least  <dig>  km <dig>  <cit> . they can replicate in cell culture to very high titers and are relatively stable to environmental influences  <cit> .

for the surveillance of possible bioterrorism targets and endangered populations, rapid detection and diagnosis of veev are of crucial importance. in the past, the generation of monoclonal murine antibodies has improved the fast identification of veev infections to locate human and equine outbreaks of encephalitis. on the other hand, monospecific diagnostic monoclonal antibodies  against veev are either hardly available on the market or too expensive for extensive use. in view of these current limitations the generation of specific high affinity recombinant antibodies may significantly improve the current situation and can make the rapid immunological detection widely available.

a promising method to generate recombinant antibodies against human pathogenic viruses like veev is the antibody phage display technology. using antibody phage display, genotype and phenotype of an antibody fragment are linked by fusing the antibody gene fragment to the minor coat protein iii gene of the filamentous bacteriophage m <dig>  the resulting antibody fragment::piii fusion protein is displayed on the surface of the phage particles  <cit> . the most common antibody formats used for this technology are the fragment antigen binding  and the single chain fragment variable . in comparison to the fab, that is consisting of the fragment determining  of the heavy chain and the light chain linked by a disulphide bond, the scfv simply consists of the variable region of the heavy chain  and the variable region of the light chain , connected by a short peptide linker  <cit> . the selection of antibody fragments from antibody gene libraries is performed by an in vitro selection process  <cit> , that is also referred to as "panning".

in this study, we demonstrated the selection of human antibody fragments from a naïve antibody gene library specific for the detection of veev. we describe their immunological properties and discuss their possible application of these antibodies for diagnosis and detection of veev after a potential bioterrorism assault or natural outbreak of veev.

RESULTS
selection of recombinant antibodies against veev from a human naïve antibody library
in order to generate antibody fragments reactive to members of the vee virus serocomplex the human naive scfv antibody gene library hal4/ <dig> was used. all pannings were performed in a biosafety level  <dig> laboratory and the vaccine strain, tc <dig>  as a medically important and epizootic alphavirus species was used as antigen.

the phage library was subjected to  <dig> rounds of panning and representative phage clones were assessed for their ability to bind veev tc <dig> immobilized onto  <dig> microwell plates. in order to exclude the enrichment of false-positive phage, the binding to supernatant of non-infected vero cells  was determined. furthermore, the non-specific bindings of scfv phage to the veev-specific capture antibodies mab  <dig> and mab vee-wis without and with an non-specific antigen, like lysozyme, was examined. as shown in figure  <dig> a significant enrichment of veev-specific polyclonal antibody phage occurred after the third panning round. however, besides the specific accumulation of binders also a severe co-enrichment of antibodies to the capture antibodies was observed.

single clones were isolated from the third panning round. soluble scfvs were produced in microtitre plates and analyzed by antigen elisa on immobilized inactivated veev particles. the elisa analysis using soluble scfvs instead of scfv phage minimized the occurance of false positives, because some antibody fragments bind only as antibody phage particles. inactivated veev particles were used to ensure that the antibodies selected on active veev particles bound inactivated virus, too. in initial tests, we observed the enrichment of antibodies binding to vero cell culture components. this effect was enhanced if veev particles were directly coated onto the wells and not captured by antibodies. therefore, vrs purified vero cell culture supernatant from non virus infected cells was used, because proteins from the cell culture supernatant were also enriched by the vrs system. in total,  <dig> antibody clones were analyzed by antigen elisa . due to the signal to noise ratio,  <dig> veev binding scfv clones were further subjected to bstni fingerprinting to sort out clones with identical restriction pattern . after dna sequencing,  <dig> different scfvs were finally found from this panning . one additional scfv clone  was isolated by a slightly different panning strategy. interestingly, only antibodies with lambda light chains were obtained. according to the integrative database of germ-line variable genes from the immunoglobulin loci of human  the isolated scfv fragments contained the antigen-binding variable domains of the light chains lv <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the heavy chains of the isolated scfvs belonged to the subfamily hv <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while hv <dig> predominated .

tab.  <dig>  given are the names of the gene segments according to vbase <dig>  abbreviations: hv: v  gene segments of the heavy chain; d: d  gene segment; hj: j  gene segment of the heavy chain; lv: v gene segment of the light chain; lj: j gene segment of the light chain.

production and characterization of veev-specific scfv phage
in order to prove the presentation of functional scfvs on the selected monoclonal scfv phage clones, the clones were subjected to immunoblot analysis. scfv phage were separated by sds-page under reducing conditions and the corresponding immunoblot was stained using an anti-piii mab. all scfv phage preparations showed a nearly equal and efficient display of scfv antibodies on their surface. this straightly allows to compare the cognate elisa, western blot and immunohistochemistry results. the anti-piii immunoblot of a selection of anti-veev scfv phage is shown in figure  <dig> 

verification of the veev-specific immunoreaction with scfv phage and scfv-fc fusions
in order to evaluate whether the antibody format or design influences the specific binding capacity, elisa results obtained with selected scfv phage  and their corresponding scfv-fc fusions  were compared. purified formalin inactivated veev tc <dig> antigen was immobilized onto microwells and serial dilutions of either anti-veev scfv phage or serial dilution of scfv-fc fusion proteins were used for detection. all selected scfv phage clones and the corresponding scfv-fc fusions were able to bind directly immobilized veev particles . the background binding of the control antibody iib <dig> scfv phage increased when using very high scfv phage particle concentrations. a scfv phage concentration of about  <dig> ×  <dig> –  <dig> ×  <dig> scfv phage particles, respectively 10– <dig> ng/ml scfv-fc fusion proteins are well suited for the detection of immobilized veev particles. additionally, it was also possible to detect direct immobilised active veev tc <dig> particles by elisa using scfv phage , respectively scfv-fc fusion proteins .

sds-page and western blotting are valuable approaches to examine which veev structural proteins are recognized by the selected anti-veev antibody fragments. since the viral glycoproteins e <dig> and e <dig> can be separated from each other under non-reducing conditions, virus samples were first disintegrated by incubation for  <dig> minutes at 56°c in laemmli sample buffer containing no 2-mercaptoethanol. the samples were separated by 10% sds-page, blotted onto a pvdf membrane and stained as described. in general  <dig> ×  <dig> anti-veev scfv phage/ml were used for the specific detection of structural proteins . the e <dig> protein specific antibodies mab  <dig>  and mab 8/ <dig>  served as positive control and displayed the expected electrophoretic profile typical for the alphavirus e <dig> protein  and the cognate viral e1/e <dig> heterodimer . interestingly, under non reducing conditions most of the anti-veev scfv phage displayed a nearly similar binding pattern and were able to bind either the e <dig> or e <dig> glycoprotein and the corresponding heterodimer . however, several of the specific scfv phage also caused an undefined smear if used in immunoblot analysis. this might be explained by prolonged staining. if the corresponding scfv-fc fusions were used for binding, clear and defined bands, representing either e <dig> or e <dig> protein, were detectable similar to the e <dig> glycoprotein positive controls in figure 5b. in contrast, if virus samples were either prepared under reducing conditions or boiled prior to sds-page, no specific binding was observed. therefore, the epitopes recognized by the scfv phage and scfv-fc fusions are likely to be conformation dependent and the secondary structure seems to be critical for the binding of viral structural proteins. none of the isolated scfv fragments identified any linear epitopes.

evaluation of the cross-reactivity with different alphavirus species and subspecies
in order to test the cross-reactivity of the selected antibody clones with other strains of the veev as well as with other antigenic complexes, their binding was evaluated in a sandwich antigen catch elisa by using an alphavirus specific mab mixture for capturing and the selected scfv phage for detection.

an established veev-specific  and alphavirus genus-specific sandwich elisa  served as positive control. as negative control, cell culture of non-infected vero cells was used. as marker antibody the biotinylated anti-veev mab 8/ <dig> was used for the detection of all veev strains  and a biotinylated mixture of antibodies consisting of mab 8/ <dig>  mab vee-wis <dig>  mab 12/ <dig> and mab 42/ <dig> was used for the group specific detection of alphaviruses . all viral antigens were captured by either the veev-specific mab veev-wis <dig> or a mab mixture of anti-alphavirus antibodies, consisting of mab 3/ <dig>  mab 12/ <dig> and mab vee-wis <dig> . some virus strains  were captured better than others .

all veev antigens were employed with a nearly similar tcid50/ml of  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig>  in addition to the veev vaccine strain tc <dig> of subtype iab, the ussr  vaccine strain veev  <dig> and the british ncpv strain veev 12/ <dig> were applied. furthermore, the selected scfv clones were tested for the specific detection of eastern equine encephalitis virus  strain h178/ <dig>  western equine encephalitis virus  strain h160/ <dig> and chikungunya virus  strain s <dig> petersfield.

positive elisa signals were obtained for the different veev strains with all tested scfv phage clones . in contrast, the scfv chn-24-2a <dig> showed a comparable low antigen binding. maximum binding in the antigen sandwich elisa was found for the russian strain veev  <dig>  this might be explained by the fact that this virus sample was chemically inactivated prior to use. we suppose that dependent on the inactivation the critical epitopes are more accessible for antibody detection.

however, none of the selected anti-veev scfv phage showed any cross-reactivity with other alphaviruses, when used as detection antibody. all positive controls exhibited the expected binding pattern and were captured and detected by their specific mabs in the elisa.

detection of veev antigen in lysates of infected vero cells
in order to examine the broad immunological applicability of the selected scfvs, we also tested the recombinant antibody fragments for the specific detection of veev tc <dig> in lysates of infected vero cells. these cell lysates were prepared by disrupting infected cells with  <dig> m urea while coupled to microwells. detection was performed with scfv phage followed by an incubation with mab anti-m <dig> conjugated to hrp. lysates of non-infected vero cells and veev antigen incubated with the mab ii-b <dig> served as negative control.

specific binding could be confirmed for nearly all selected antibody fragments except for the clones chn24-2-a <dig> and mk269-e <dig>  the most stringent binding results were obtained with the scfv clones chn24-2-a <dig>  chn24-2-c <dig>  chn24-2-f <dig> and mk271-g <dig> .

in addition, detection of veev-specific antigen by immunohistochemistry in tc <dig> infected and formaldehyde fixed vero cells was possible. similar to the results described above, all scfv clones, except for clone chn24-2-a <dig>  showed a specific cytoplasmic immunostaining of veev infected vero cells .

discussion
for the detection of veev after an potential bioterrorims assault, e.g. by use of a veev aerosol, or a natural outbreak of veev, a fast diagnosis of these pathogen is necessary. the present work describes for the first time the screening and isolation of anti-veev antibody fragments from a human naïve antibody gene library by phage display. ten out of eleven scfv clones were selected by the panning strategy using a mab mixture for virus capturing as described. one further clone, mk271-g <dig>  was isolated by an alternative panning, that was performed on directly immobilized viral antigen. the use of antibody captured virus particles was the preferred panning strategy because preliminary tests revealed, that panning on directly immobilized veev antigen enhanced especially the enrichment of non-specific binders.

to our knowledge, there are no studies demonstrating the successful in vitro antibody selection against human pathogen complete virus particles using naïve antibody gene libraries. a successful panning against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus using a human semisynthetic library is described by van den brink et al.  <cit> . in most other studies recombinant or purified virus proteins were used for panning if using a naïve antibody gene library  <cit> . the pannings using complete particles are mostly performed using immune libraries, e.g de carvalho et al.  <cit> , koch et al.  <cit>  or duan et al.  <cit> . the panning procedure described here might be also useful for the in vitro antibody selection of scfvs against other viral targets from human naïve antibody gene libraries, in particular when either immunized patients are not available or immunisation is not ethically feasible.

nearly all scfvs were able to detect active as well as inactive veev tc <dig> viral antigen. comparable indirect elisa data were obtained with scfv phage and their corresponding scfv-fc fusions. the specific immunoreaction could be verified by western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and by immunostaining of urea disrupted cell lysates. the selected antibody clones were reactive with all tested members of the vee virus serocomplex but showed no significant cross-reactivity with closely related alphavirus species like weev, eeev and chikv, if used as detection molecules.

all alphaviruses share a number of structural, sequential and functional similarities. immunological typing approaches categorize the nearly  <dig> species into seven serocomplexes or species. the nucleotide and amino acid identity among these antigenic complexes, subtypes and varieties varies from  <dig> to  <dig> %  <cit> . in general, the sequences of structural proteins are more divergent than the sequences of non-structural proteins. in immunoblot analysis the anti-veev scfv phage displayed a similar binding pattern like the e <dig> protein specific antibodies mab  <dig>  and mab 8/ <dig>  <cit>  and identified probably the e <dig> glycoprotein and the cognate viral e1/e <dig> heterodimer. interestingly, all obtained scfv clones identified structural epitopes that are still folded after denaturation at 56°c under non-reducing conditions. in contrast, if the viral antigens were either prepared under reducing conditions or boiled prior to sds-page, no specific binding was observed.

a possible neutralisation activity of the selected scfvs has to be assessed in further studies. normally, the protective immunity to alphaviruses is associated with an antibody reactivity to the virion glycoproteins e <dig> and so far, six conformationally stable epitopes were identified as critical for virus neutralization  <cit> . furthermore our antibodies are fully human and therefore better suited for applications like as passive vaccination than murine antibodies.

to date, veev diagnosis is performed using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies  <cit>  and also scfv fragments have been analysed  <cit> . this study showed that scfv phage are applicable for a broad range of anti-veev diagnosis assays: antigen elisa on purified virus particles, elisa on cell lysate and immunoblot. furthermore, the recombinant fragments offer the possibility to develop a veev-specific diagnosis assay since the specific scfv phage can be easily produced and purified in high amounts. this could be an alternative to fullsize iggs for an elisa assay. at least, they might be applied for immuno-pcr  <cit>  in order to increase the sensitivity of detection. these methods can be used for the diagnosis of veev in the enviroment and for the detection of human or equine veev infections.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human naïve scfv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. the described antibody selection procedure may also be useful for the in vitro antibody selection of antibody fragments against other viral targets from human naïve antibody gene libraries, in particular when immunized patients are not available or immunisation is not ethically feasible. the broad and sensitive applicability of anti-veev scfv-presenting phage for the immunological detection and diagnosis of alphavirus species was demonstrated. the selected recombinant antibody fragments will improve the rapid and specific detection of veev infections after human and equine outbreaks of encephalitis, where an early and definite identification is of critical importance.
