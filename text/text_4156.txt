BACKGROUND
the widespread application of parallel high-throughput ‘next generation’ sequencing  technologies has made whole genome sequence  data available for tens of thousands of bacterial isolates  <cit> . increasingly, these data are publicly available only as depositions in short-read sequence archives: in december  <dig> the european bioinformatics institute  sequence read archive , contained more than  <dig>  bacterial wgs records, over 90% of which comprised millions of short sequence reads each of fewer than  <dig> bases in length. these data represent a major resource for studies of bacterial diversity, evolution and function; however, as the throughput of genome finishing and annotation technologies has not kept pace with sequence determination, the genomes have to be reassembled to be interpreted. typically, this is done either by mapping to a reference sequence or by de novo assembly to generate draft genomes comprising multiple contiguous sequences .

the approach of mapping short-read sequences to a reference sequence has been effectively used to analyse wgs data from closely related isolates in numerous studies , especially by using the data obtained to reconstruct genealogies based on phylogenetic trees. this approach has a number of limitations, including: the necessity for a high-quality reference sequence with which to make the comparison; variation in sequence not present in the reference cannot be detected; the approach is poorly scalable; analyses typically have to be re-run as new genomes are obtained; and finally, the density of sequence polymorphisms in the majority of bacterial populations is such that this approach is not feasible for the study of isolates that are not genetically closely related. the use of de novo assembly methods represents an alternative, more broadly applicable approach, with assemblers based on de brujin graphing being widely used as they deal effectively with large volumes of data  <cit>  and can assemble short-read sequences of fewer than  <dig> bases in length into contigs that contain the majority of the genome. further, when paired-end sequencing strategies are employed, ‘high quality draft’ bacterial genomes can be assembled . once they have been assembled, these sequences can be annotated by comparisons to known genes or genome databases  <cit> , using an approach similar to that used in multilocus sequence typing , which has been widely employed for sequence-based analyses at the population scale since  <dig>  <cit> . the bacterial isolate genome sequence database  platform provides this functionality for wgs data  <cit> .

neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, is a pathogen of global significance and an informative model organism for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype, as it is highly diverse phenotypically and genotypically  <cit> . due to the importance of the disease, the most studied meningococcal phenotype is the propensity to invade, although most episodes of meningococcal infection result in asymptomatic carriage, which typically occurs in 10-20% of the human population  <cit> . only a very small number of infections result in devastating and rapidly progressing disease, in the form of septicaemia, meningitis, or both. for reasons that are incompletely understood, some meningococcal genotypes are much more likely to cause invasive disease than others. nucleotide sequence-based typing, especially mlst and antigen sequence typing , have established that these genotypes correspond to certain genealogies, known as the ‘hyperinvasive lineages’  <cit> . there are a number of factors known to contribute to the hyperinvasive phenotype, particularly the possession of certain capsular polysaccharides, but species-level comparisons suggest that the majority of the pan-genome is widely shared among invasive and non-invasive genotypes. this has led to the conclusion that the ability to cause invasive disease is both polygenic and different among hyperinvasive lineages , but the determinants associated with particular lineages remain poorly defined. comparative wgs of meningococcal isolate collections that include representative disease and carriage isolates have the potential to define the genetic differences which determine the hyper invasive phenotypes.

here, wgs data collected by ngs technology were investigated with de novo assembly and population annotation to characterize  <dig> diverse meningococcal genomes, including the major hyperinvasive lineages observed worldwide over the last 60 years. the draft genomes were analysed for accuracy and coverage using the bigsdb platform  <cit>  which enabled comparison with  <dig> antigen and mlst typing loci previously characterised with sanger sequencing and four finished reference genomes, cross-validating these technologies. these data established the robustness and reliability of using de novo draft genomes for a population-wide level of analysis for meningococcus genomes and presented a wgs description of the major hyperinvasive lineages, providing insights into their structure, evolution, and function.

RESULTS
genome assembly
short-read sequences were assembled into draft genomes using velvet  <cit>  and velvetoptimiser  <cit>  programs, using  <dig> or  <dig> base read files. the sum total length of assembled contigs ranged from  <dig> ,180 bp to  <dig> ,536 bp and had a g + c content between 51-52%, consistent with previously finished meningococcal genomes . assemblies consisted of  <dig> to  <dig> contigs, with a mean of  <dig>  the average n <dig>  a value that represents the length at which contigs of equal or longer length contain at least 50% of the assembled sequence, across all genomes was  <dig>  bp. this statistic provided an indication of the total genome coverage; however, it was not a measure of genome assembly quality. overall, a higher k-mer setting for the assembly was associated with the higher n <dig> values and, within the bounds of the read length, assembled repeat regions within the genome that were under 100 bp in length.

all the de novo assemblies consisted of contigs terminating at repetitive sequence regions longer than the read length of  <dig> or  <dig> bases and these termination regions contained a higher read depth than the preceding regions. a change from taq polymerase to phusion® high-fidelity dna polymerase affected the assembly statistics , and increased the average longest contig length by 41% . improved sequencing chemistry that generated read lengths of  <dig> bases resulted in a 20% decrease in the average number of contigs per genome . the combined use of the new dna polymerases and improved chemistry resulted in a decreased number of contigs and a reduction of incomplete coding sequence  of approximately 61% .table  <dig>

two genomes failed to sequence in their original groups , these genomes were subsequently rerun in group j.

the increase in read length used for multiplex group k produced larger than expected assembly improvements. a significant drop in the number of contigs and a corresponding increase in the n <dig> value were achieved with the relatively small  <dig> base read increase. therefore, additional increased base read lengths should continue to increase the coverage of long repeat regions and decrease the number of contigs per assembly.



sequencing accuracy
the wgs assemblies were compared to previously determined dideoxy  sequence results at the mlst  <cit> , emlst  <cit> , pora vr <dig> and vr2
 <cit> , feta
 <cit>  and fhbp
 <cit>  loci found throughout the genome . there were thirty-four sequence discrepancies  between the illumina de novo assembled and sanger sequenced alleles, from  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes . the number and distribution of sequence changes found in the resequencing experiments enabled the likely reasons for the discrepancies to be identified. in the majority of cases these could be attributed to either editing or labelling problems in the original sanger sequencing experiments with only four instances that were a direct consequence of the assembly of the short-read sequences by the velvet algorithm. the four mlst profiles affected by trace file editing errors maintained their original clonal complex assignment; however, their sequence type  was amended to a new designation as a consequence of this work. in summary, the errors in the original sanger experiments were due to: eleven trace file editing errors;  <dig> samples mislabelled during sanger sequencing; and four occurrences of velvet mis-assembly caused by short tandem repeat  regions.figure  <dig>

the four draft sequences for which finished genome sequences were available  were compared to the published closed sequences using the bigsdb genome comparator tool. sequence discrepancies were found between all four resequenced draft genomes and their respective finished reference genome. the h44/ <dig> and g <dig> reference genomes, created with roche  <dig> technology and finished using capillary sequencing, had sequence differences in thirty hypothetical proteins, thirty-five annotated cds, nine pseudogenes and five putative proteins, a total of  <dig> loci for these two published genomes . fam <dig> and z <dig> reference genomes, obtained using abi  <dig> and a combination of abi <dig> and  <dig> respectively, had sequence discrepancies among twenty-two annotated cds, ten pseudogenes, five putative protein sequences and fourteen hypothetical proteins; totalling  <dig> loci of the published cds sequences for these genomes. the majority of these cds affected  had a single nucleotide change each and the remaining 30% had two or more nucleotide changes. the differences were categorized as non-synonymous or synonymous amino acid changes . differences caused by assembly failures  or paralogous loci  contained cross identified reads . paralogous gene cross-identification occurred most often in cds annotated as hypothetical proteins, a total of ten. these, plus six additional paralogous loci, were manually curated and defined using up- and down-stream sequence in order to enable the bigsdb scanning function to correctly distinguish the divergent regions of the paralogous genes without manual curation. a list containing the identification of all cds with sequence differences, and those loci missing in the draft genomes was generated .

the bigsdb genome comparator tool was used to assess genome coverage of the resequenced reference genomes . the z <dig> draft genome contained  <dig> of the  <dig>  cds present in the reference genome, of which  <dig>  were partial sequences, that is the locus was found at the end of a contig and therefore incompletely assembled. the four loci not identified in the draft genome belonged to four non-contiguous hypothetical proteins: nma <dig>  nma <dig>  nma <dig> and nma <dig>  totalling  <dig> nucleotides. comparison of the fam <dig> draft to the reference genome identified  <dig> of  <dig>  published cds and  <dig>  were also incomplete. the nine cds ,  <dig>  bases, not found in the draft genome included three mafb <dig> genes , a putative frpc pseudogene  and an unidentified pseudogene  in addition to genes encoding: a single mafb protein fragment , the iron-regulated frpc protein , a pilus secretin , and putative cell-surface protein . the bigsdb genome comparator tool identified  <dig> of  <dig> published cds in the h44/ <dig> draft genome  and  <dig> of  <dig> published cds of the g <dig> draft genome . h44/ <dig> resequenced missing  <dig>  bases that included genes encoding: three tspb family proteins , two iron-regulated proteins frpa and frpc , nlpc/p <dig> family protein , a putative caudovirus prohead protease  and a hypothetical protein gene ; and the resequenced g <dig> genome was missing genes for three hypothetical proteins , a membrane protein , a fimbral protein precursor  and two frpc iron-regulated proteins , covering  <dig>  bases. all four resequenced genomes were also mapped to their respective finished genomes to look for the missing loci. in all instances the loci were present in the short-read sequence data, however read depth was low  and therefore could not be assembled by the parameters set for the velvet assembly.table  <dig>

sequence differences were identified using the bigsdb genome comparator tool. all transposase cds were removed from the analysis. the z <dig> and fam <dig> were originally sequenced and finished using abi <dig> and  <dig> or abi  <dig> methods in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and the h44/ <dig> and g <dig> genomes were originally sequenced and finished in  <dig> using roche  <dig> flx and capillary-based sequencing.



while it is possible to revise the assembly parameters and recover some of the missing data in the assemblies, this would potentially be at a cost to the overall quality of the assembly by swapping specificity and sensitivity and could in fact reduce the n <dig> value, therefore this option was not implemented for this analysis. technically, the foundations resulting in the underrepresentation of these regions in the subsequent sequence reads have many sources: for example gc bias affects the stability of the dna strand which could influence the read ability or modify the probability of a fragmentation. it has been shown that optimized or pcr-free protocols reduce gc bias affects  and if these genomes were resequenced using a pcr-free approach it is possible the overall genome coverage would increase.

gene-by-gene annotation
all of the draft genome assemblies were annotated using a gene-by-gene approach using the bigsdb platform as described previously  <cit> . each genome was scanned against defined loci contained in the pubmlst neisseria sequence definition database using the default parameters . alleles previously identified were assigned an allele number automatically, in a process referred to as ‘tagging’, and new alleles were manually curated and submitted to the sequence definition database for allele number assignment. the genome data were subsequently rescanned to assign the new alleles to the respective genome in which it was found. partially assembled loci, those found at the end of a contig, were tagged as present in the genome but flagged as incomplete. the average number of incomplete coding sequences  found per genome was  <dig> . bigsdb also identified sixteen paralogous cds pairs, these included six recognized cds , ten hypothetical genes and one putative lipoprotein .

the meningococcal core genome
comparison of the four finished genomes identified  <dig> cds  that were present in all genomes. the list was refined by determining gene presence of the  <dig> cds in two additional finished genomes  <cit> . the de novo assembled draft genomes were then also compared to identify cds present in 95% of the genomes, to account for the draft nature of the genomes and genes missing rarely in isolates. all genomes were unique in terms of gene content, but  <dig> cds were present in at least 95% of the isolates. these were categorised as ‘core loci’ for this dataset and were used to search the functional pathway database kegg  <cit>  to determine the function of the gene product of each cds . only 37% of the core loci  had an enzyme commission number  assigned. those with an assigned ec indicated the presence of two environmental processing pathways, four genetic information processing pathways and  <dig> metabolic functional pathways. almost three-quarters  of the ec identified genes were involved in metabolic pathways, 20% were genetic information processing pathways and 6% were identified as being involved in environmental information processing.figure  <dig>

genealogical analyses
distance matrices based on the number of locus differences were calculated among the  <dig> isolates and  <dig> previously published genomes  <cit>  with the genome comparator tool and represented with neighbornet graphs for the core loci  and the ribosomal protein  genes  <cit>  . the rmlst and cgmlst schemes clustered 101/ <dig>  of the isolates into ten distinct lineages that corresponded to the major invasive clonal complexes identified by seven-locus mlst  <cit>  and were consistent with previously defined clades  <cit> .figure  <dig>

genomes from the 20th and 21st century. the relationships between meningococcal isolates are represented by two datasets in which   <dig> core meningococcal loci  or   <dig> ribosomal protein genes , a subset of the  <dig> core loci, are used. in both trees major phylogenetic groups are noted a-d. for cross-compatible identification, and where there are  <dig> or more strains per lineage are present, the major mlst derived clonal complexes  are identified by colour: red – st- <dig> cc, purple – st- <dig> cc, pink – st- <dig> cc, teal – st- <dig> cc, yellow – st- <dig> cc, orange – st- <dig> cc, green – st-41/ <dig> cc, blue – st- <dig> cc, grey – st- <dig> cc, olive – st- <dig> cc. capsular types other than a, b, or c are noted in parentheses, accept for lineage  <dig> which are labelled . unlabelled nodes are undefined lineages and currently do not have a clonal complex association; a full list of lineage and associated clonal complex nomenclature can be found in table  <dig> 



the higher resolution of rmlst and cgmlst, as opposed to the seven- or twenty- locus mlst, also resolved the substructure characteristic of lineage  <dig> . this lineage sub-structure is captured in mlst by the designation of two central genotypes that are differentially associated with invasive disease, and at the sequence type level share five of the seven mlst alleles  <cit> . analysis of this lineage also showed that isolates associated with the st- <dig> belonged to a well-defined monophyletic lineage, while the st- <dig> associated isolates were a more diverse but distinct lineage. further exploration of this complex is necessary to more fully define the relationships within this clade and the variable pathogenic nature associated with each group. the association of capsule loci with the lineage  <dig> , and in lineage  <dig> , at the cgmlst level  shows the serotype b and c associated genomes on different branches, and only lineage  <dig>  maintains this separation at the rmlst level . the remaining lineages did not have sufficient numbers to clearly differentiate capsule associations; and additional studies with larger strain collections will be required to make these associations more distinctly.

four sets of lineage specific draft genomes, thirty-four in total, were assessed for genome coverage using one of four reference genome annotations and the bigsdb genome comparator tool. each of the four sets of de novo assembled genomes contained over 98% of the cds defined by their closest reference genome. seven isolates in the collection belong to lineage  <dig>  and were compared to the h44/ <dig> reference genome. all  <dig> of the h44/ <dig> cds were identified across the seven de novo assembled genomes. there was an average of  <dig> cds  identified per genome. seven isolates belonging to lineage  <dig>  were compared to the g <dig> reference genome. all 1911 g <dig> cds were identified across the de novo assembled genomes, with an average of  <dig> cds  found per genome. a further ten isolates belonged to lineage  <dig>  and were compared to the fam <dig> genome sequence. the comparison identified  <dig>  of the  <dig> fam <dig> genome cds across the ten genomes, with an average cds count of  <dig> cds  per genome. ten isolates also belonged to the lineage  <dig>  and were compared to the z <dig> genome, identifying  <dig>  of  <dig> cdss across all ten genomes. each genome had an average of  <dig> cds  per genome and the only cds not found in all ten of the lineage  <dig> genomes was the coenzyme a gene, coad.

discussion
exhaustive comparison of bacterial genomes, including all sources of genetic variation  requires complete, closed  genomes. the majority, if not all, of short-read wgs data generated to date with ngs technology are incapable of meeting this ideal without extensive additional data combined with manual assembly and curation  <cit> . there are many questions in bacterial biology, however, which can be adequately addressed with population genomic approaches that employ subsets of the genome  <cit> , such as mlst , rmlst  and cgmlst; and for these analyses ngs datasets provide a rich source of information  <cit> . for such analyses to be robustly conducted, however, it is necessary to establish an analysis paradigm that interprets data consistently within known parameters of completeness and accuracy  <cit> . here we demonstrate how bioinformatics tools that are freely available and widely understood can be combined to interrogate ngs data using the example of the diverse human pathogen neisseria meningitidis
 <cit> . the data and analyses are easily accessed through the pubmlst neisseria website .figure  <dig> 
location of rmlst genes within the meningococcal genome.




although the sequence read lengths employed here were relatively short   <cit>  and the meningococcus has a complex genome comprising many short tandem repeats  and homopolymeric tracts , the velvet algorithm was consistently capable of assembling the majority of protein coding sequences  to extremely high levels of accuracy. indeed, where comparable data were available for genes previously used for sequence based-typing, the majority of the discrepancies were due to errors in the editing or labelling of the specimens used in the original sanger sequences, and the remaining, the result of str sequence compression during assembly  <cit> . once these errors had been taken in to account, the two approaches were in complete agreement. there was also very good agreement with complete reference genomes, although this depended on the read length of the short-read sequence data, with substantial improvement as read length increased. read lengths of 100 bp, which are now routinely available, would reduce the missing data substantially  <cit> . data quality was also determined by the details of the chemistry and procedures used  <cit> , showing that ngs data are optimally useful when this information is deposited with them. some coverage effects were seen, with sequences near the origin of replication consistently sequenced to a higher depth  <cit> , than others but the genome of each assembly was adequately covered.

the bigsdb platform accommodates sequence data derived from a particular isolate ranging from a single gene through multiple genes and contigs up to and including complete genomes  <cit> . the genome comparator tool can either use the annotations from a reference genome, which were used to compare the reference genomes with the assembled genomes, or sets of loci defined in the pubmlst sequence definition database, for which it maintains a complete catalogue of diversity described to date  <cit> . to enable consistent referencing each complete defined locus in the pubmlst neisseria database, which can be any identifiable sequence string, was identified with a unique and arbitrary ‘neis’ number, which can be associated with other designations such as conventional demeric gene names  <cit> . additional loci that represent gene fragments used in typing schemes and peptide loci representing typing antigen variable regions  <cit> , are also indexed within the database. the bigsdb ‘autotagger’ function identified and automatically annotated an average of  <dig> cds from each assembled genome, with only a small number of paralogous loci  in the pan-genome. the currently identified paralogous loci require additional manual annotation, they have been found to vary between the neisseria species and may vary among meningococcal lineages. in conclusion, the approach can be used to analyse large numbers of wgs datasets consistently and is generally applicable for use across the bacterial domain.

ultimately the pubmlst neisseria database can be expanded, through a process of iterative gene discovery, to become a catalogue of the meningococcal ‘pan genome’ i.e. all of the genes present in the species or genus  <cit> . this database will develop over time by a process of community annotation but, by definition, the members of the meningococcal ‘core genome’, i.e. genes present in all meningococci, will already be present. because every bacterial isolate is potentially an unrepresentative mutant and due to the imperfect nature of ngs assemblies, the core genome cannot be simply defined as the genes present in all isolates; however, the estimate of a core genome comprising  <dig> genes generated here is in good agreement with other estimates  which were based on substantially fewer genomes  <cit> . a total 37% of the meningococcal core genes were assigned an ec number at the time of writing, indicating the magnitude of the annotation task which ngs data generates. while the membership of the core genome will be refined over time, it is unlikely to be very different from that proposed here. an updated list of meningococcal core genes will be maintained in the database.

the genealogies reconstructed with the neighbornet algorithm using genome comparator data for the cgmlst and rmlst were consistent with those previously generated with mlst and a variety of other approaches  <cit> . the ribosomal genes  and core genome  data provide more resolution, demonstrating that the six major hyperinvasive lineages included in this dataset cluster in to a number of larger groups  <cit> . some lineages are more closely related to each other although the star phylogeny demonstrates a highly diverse and recombining population from which invasive lineages have emerged independently on several occasions  <cit> . as suggested from multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  and other data  <cit> , the serogroup a-associated lineages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  likely share a common ancestor  <cit> , as do: lineage  <dig>  and lineage  <dig> ; and lineage  <dig>  and lineage  <dig> . lineage  <dig>  is a diverse lineage comprising both more and less invasive types. these data confirm that the invasive lineages are defined by sequence variation in the core genome, although certain members of the accessory genome, for example the capsule  <cit> , the meningococcal disease associated island phage  <cit> , and restriction modification systems  <cit>  are differentially distributed among lineages.

to reflect the increased resolution of whole genome typing we propose the use of a lineage nomenclature  to distinguish groupings obtained by rmlst and cgmlst from the clonal complex association identified by mlst. this nomenclature also allows for the designations of sub-lineages which our data set, and others not described here, define additional prevalent biological and phenotypic associations such as the et- <dig> mutants of lineage  <dig>  the proposal was presented to a satellite sub-group meeting of the xix international pathogenic neisseria conference in october  <dig>  which included submitters, curators and users and the proposal is under consideration for adoption by the pubmlst management committee.table  <dig> 
proposed whole genome lineage nomenclature



^ distinct sub-lineages present; proposal to use decimal based  system for defined sub-lineages.

to simplify and differentiate between mlst typing and whole genome based typing we propose a lineage nomenclature that is associated with defined clonal complex . the data includes all pubmlst neisseria database isolates.



CONCLUSIONS
wgs data has the potential to unify studies of bacteria by providing comprehensive descriptions of genomic variation. to achieve this it is necessary to:  make the data available in a comprehensible way, along with information describing its completeness and accuracy; and  link them to provenance and phenotype information, which describes the source of the sample and its properties, as well as the known properties of the genes identified and the deduced product. these datasets will grow in completeness and accuracy over time; however, it is also necessary for these data to be presented in a stable context, enabling even incomplete information to be explored. the approach described and validated here for the meningococcus is one way of achieving this, which employs generic, freely accessible and widely used tools. the use of the web interface within the pubmlst neisseria database enables a process of community annotation whereby different members of the community can participate in the maintenance and improvement of sequence annotation and interpretation.
