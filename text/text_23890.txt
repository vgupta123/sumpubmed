BACKGROUND
heparan sulfate proteoglycans  consist of proteoglycan core proteins to which long linear heparan sulfate  chains carrying sulfate groups in different positions are attached  <cit> . they are ubiquitous components of cell surfaces and of the extracellular matrix. extensive biochemical and genetic studies have shown that hspgs influence the extracellular transport and activity of paracrine signaling molecules such as fgf, wnt, and hh. several excellent reviews on the subject of the complex role of hspgs in developmental processes have been written  <cit> .

fgf proteins are thoroughly studied hspg binding proteins with important roles in cell migration, proliferation and differentiation during development  <cit> . in drosophila, the functions of fgf receptors are abnormal in embryos with defective hspg biosynthesis  <cit> . mice ugdh mutants  have reduced synthesis of hs, chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan, strongly suggesting that glycosaminoglycans are required for fgf signaling  <cit> . moreover, a specific inhibition of hspg biosynthesis during brain development results in defective fgf <dig> function  <cit> . it is suggested that the hspg glypcan <dig> enhances fgf signaling during xenopus neurulation  <cit>  and hspg biosynthesis is shown to influence fgf function during limb development in zebrafish  <cit>  and lens development and lacrimal gland induction in mice  <cit> .

wnt and hh proteins are secreted signaling morphogens with functions in numerous developmental processes. a large number of experiments in drosophila have revealed a crucial role for hspgs in regulating these functions . in vertebrates, several studies demonstrate an essential role for the hspg glypican in wnt <dig> signaling during gastrulation  <cit> . decreased hspg sulfation reduces shh signaling in mice  <cit>  and decreased hs polymerization is suggested to interfere with the function of indian hedgehog  .

several different mechanisms may be used by hspgs to effect their regulation of fgf, wnt and hh function. cell surface hspgs can serve as co-receptors for fgf ligands  <cit>  and biochemical studies have suggested that hspgs participate in fgf signaling by directly interacting with fgf ligands and their receptors to form ligand-receptor complexes  <cit> . hspgs are probably enhancing fgf signaling by facilitating interactions of ligands and receptors or by stabilizing the signaling complex  <cit> . experiments in drosophila suggest that hspgs also act as co-receptors for the binding of hh and wg/wnt to the receptors patched and frizzled respectively  <cit> , in a similar way to the function of hspgs in fgf signaling. however, many observations support models where hspgs are instead required for proper tissue distribution of wg/wnt and hh proteins  <cit> . hspgs might protect hh and wg/wnt protein from degradation and increase the local concentration by reducing the dimensionality of ligand diffusion from three to two dimensions, thereby increasing the concentration of wnt and hh ligands close to cell surfaces . both hh and wnt proteins are lipid modified and they are unlikely to freely diffuse between cells. instead, their movement probably involves additional molecules such as lipoprotein particles  <cit> . interestingly, a recent study suggests that hspgs can influence lipid-linked morphogen signaling by a direct interaction with lipoprotein particles  <cit> .

the exostosin gene family contains glycosyltransferases required for hs biosynthesis, and include, in mouse, ext <dig>  ext <dig>  extl <dig>  extl <dig> and extl <dig>  during hs biosynthesis in the golgi compartment, a serine residue in the proteoglycan core protein is modified by stepwise addition of monosaccharides to form a linkage tetrasaccharide which constitutes the substrate for ext enzymes to initiate and polymerize the hs polysaccharide chain . ext <dig> and ext <dig> together form a copolymerase which is responsible for the polymerization process where repeating units of n-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid are incorporated in the growing linear polysaccharide chain. during polymerization, the hs chains are modified by the addition of sulfate groups in tissue-specific patterns  <cit> . the relative expression of hspg biosynthesis genes may sometimes determine the outcome of the process, but the regulation of hspg biosynthesis is far from understood  <cit> . drosophila exostosins genes include ttv, sotv and botv , which have been demonstrated to be important for the signaling activity of hh and wg/wnt and for shaping extracellular morphogen gradients . ext1-null and ext2-null mice both fail to gastrulate, pointing to the early essential roles for ext genes in developing embryos  <cit> . reduced expression of ext <dig> results in delayed hypertrophic differentiation and endochondral ossification of the chondrocytes of limb growth plates, probably caused by increased ihh diffusion  <cit> . mutations in ext genes is the cause of the human disease multiple hereditary exostoses   <cit> .

the zebrafish ext <dig> and extl <dig> genes are ubiquitously expressed during zebrafish development and they are disrupted in dackel  and boxer  mutants, respectively  <cit> . in ext <dig> and extl <dig> mutants, maternally deposited mrna provides sufficient levels of hspgs to allow normal gastrulation of the embryo while hs polymerization is subsequently reduced in all tissues  <cit> . ext <dig> and extl <dig> mutants were originally isolated based on their defective limb development  <cit>  and we have previously shown that fgf <dig> signaling during limb development requires ext <dig> and extl <dig>  <cit> . ext <dig> and extl <dig> mutants also show defects in cartilage and pharyngeal arch morphogenesis  <cit> , development of the ear  <cit> , and axon sorting in the optic tract  <cit> .

the role of ext <dig> in regulating paracrine signaling is of specific interest for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the human disease mhe, but is also of general interest for elucidating the role of the hs portion of the hspgs, as opposed to the functions of the proteoglycan core protein. in this study we systematically investigate the general role of ext <dig> in fgf, wnt and hh signaling during zebrafish tissue patterning and organogenesis. we find that fgf signaling is generally reduced in ext <dig> mutants, based on the reduced expression of target genes and the observation that remaining expression of fgf target genes is sensitized for treatment with a pharmacological fgf inhibitor, suggesting that all fgf signaling is dependent on ext <dig> function. we also found that a smaller decrease of wnt <dig> and wnt5b translation is required in ext <dig> mutants, compared with siblings, to interfere with wnt dependent processes, indicating that ext <dig> is also involved in wnt signaling. in contrast, we find that hh signaling does not act on the same pathways as ext <dig>  we base this conclusion on the observation that hh signaling in ext <dig> mutants  induces normal expression of target genes,  functions in hh signaling dependent cell differentiation and  is not sensitized by partial inhibition of hh signaling compared to control embryos. we propose that the ext <dig> gene, as well as any gene influencing levels of hs in zebrafish tissues, is a candidate for regulation of aspects of fgf and wnt function, while hh signaling is likely to be largely independent of ext <dig> function.

RESULTS
expression of the fgf signaling target gene etv5b is reduced in ext <dig> mutants
the zebrafish ext <dig> mutant only contains a fraction of the normal hs levels in its tissues at  <dig> hpf  <cit>  but even though fgf signaling is believed to depend on hspgs, fgf <dig> function in the developing limb is so far the only defective fgf signaling activity observed in ext <dig> mutants  <cit> . is any fgf signaling, other than that of fgf <dig>  independent of ext <dig> function during embryonic development? we decided to test the role of ext <dig> in fgf signaling by investigating the transcription of fgf target genes. in zebrafish, expression of the transcription factor etv5b  is a direct readout of fgf signaling  <cit> . we therefore crossed heterozygous ext <dig> individuals and examined activation of etv5b in the offspring at different times of embryonic development. at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, all embryos displayed normal expression of etv5b . however, at  <dig> hpf , and at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf , etv5b expression in ext <dig> mutants is clearly reduced at all sites of expression compared to control embryos. in particular, the expression in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary is almost eliminated while some etv5b expression remains in the branchal arches, in the otic vesicle and in diencephalon. the reduction of fgf signaling does not appear to be caused by reduced expression of fgf protein, since fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> expression remains as high in ext <dig> mutants as in control embryos at  <dig> hpf in all tissues except the developing limb . here the defects in fg <dig> signaling have stopped the outgrowth  <cit> . also, at  <dig> hpf fgf8a expression is comparable in ext <dig> mutants and control embryos except in the limbs , although ext <dig> mutants display an increased prevalence of reduced fgf8a expression in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  from  <dig> hpf and onwards . we conclude that expression of the fgf signaling target gene etv5b, but not expression of fgf proteins, is generally decreased in ext <dig> mutants.

ext <dig> is a general enhancer of fgf target gene expression
the transcription factor pea <dig> is, like etv5b, dependent on fgf signaling for its expression  <cit> . surprisingly, with the exception of a reduction in midbrain-hindbrain boundary expression, pea <dig> expression is, in contrast to etv5b expression, largely similar in control embryos and ext <dig> mutants . does this mean that some fgf signaling, which predominantly induces pea <dig> expression rather than etv5b expression, is in fact independent of ext <dig> function? this was tested by exposing the embryos to the fgf signaling inhibitor su <dig> which blocks both etv5b and pea <dig> expression  <cit> . we reasoned that if pea <dig> expression in ext <dig> mutants was the result of hs independent fgf signaling, it should be equally sensitive to treatment with su <dig> as control embryos. however, while exposure of  <dig> mm su <dig>  <dig> h prior to fixation only marginally reduces pea <dig> expression in  <dig> hpf control embryos , pea <dig> expression in ext <dig> mutants is nearly eliminated by the same treatment. . a similar difference in sensitivity was observed between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf ext <dig> mutants and control embryos . moreover, the weak etv5b expression in ext <dig> mutants  was blocked by  <dig> mm su <dig> exposure , while etv5b expression was only mildly affected in su <dig> treated control embryos  compared to non-treated control embryos . we conclude that no expression of the fgf signaling target genes etv5b and pea <dig> is independent of ext <dig> in the developing zebrafish embryo.

impaired brain patterning in ext <dig> embryos
based on the reduced expression of fgf target genes in ext <dig> mutants , we hypothesized that not only is fgf <dig> signaling defective in the developing limb  <cit>  but that ext <dig> is enhancing fgf signaling in general. to test this hypothesis we investigated the function of fgf signaling in tissues other than the developing limb.

the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  is important for the patterning of the vertebrate brain and fgf protein expressed in the mhb, in particular fgf8a but not fgf <dig>  fulfill crucial organizing functions  <cit> . lee and co-workers have reported normal fgf8a expression in mhb of ext <dig> mutants at  <dig> hpf  <cit>  and since fgf8a is known to regulate its own expression in mhb  <cit> , they concluded that fgf signaling during early brain patterning was normal. however, the reduced expression of etv5b and pea <dig> in mhb at  <dig> hpf in ext <dig> mutants compared to control embryos  indicates that fgf signaling in mhb at later stages of development is reduced. we then compared the expression of two marker genes for mhb signaling, eng1a and fgf8a, in ext <dig> mutants and control embryos. at  <dig> hpf a majority of ext <dig> mutants  display reduced expression of eng1a in mhb  while in contrast a majority  of  <dig> hpf ext <dig> mutants express normal levels of fgf8a in mhb . however, at  <dig> hpf all ext <dig> mutants express reduced levels of eng1a  and fgf8a . thus, a portion of ext <dig> mutants express reduced levels of eng1a and fgf8a at  <dig> hpf and the reduction is fully penetrant at  <dig> hpf. notably, the discovery that the reduction in etv5b and pea <dig> expression in the mhb of ext <dig> mutants  precedes the fully penetrant reduction of eng1a and fgf8a expression  suggests that a reduction of fgf signaling is a possible cause of the reduction in mhb signaling. we conclude that although early brain patterning is normal, ext <dig> mutants show a gradually increased prevalence of abnormal brain patterning at later stages, consistent with a decline in fgf signaling in the mhb after  <dig> hpf.

ext <dig> interacts genetically with fgf signaling during tail development
fgf signaling is crucial for the development of the trunk and tail  <cit>  and fgf8a and fgf <dig> act together to promote zebrafish tail development  <cit> . we crossed the ext2tw25e allele into the fgf8aace mutant background. in the offspring  of ext2+/-;fgf8a+/- parents, 23% of the progeny was identified as fgf8a mutants at  <dig> hpf based on absence of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary  <cit> . interestingly, 27% of this selection displayed a distinct "hooked tail" morphology at  <dig> hpf  and at  <dig> dpf we identified them as ext2;fgf8a double mutants as they never developed pectoral fins. the hooked tail morphology of ext2;fgf8a double mutants is fully penetrant from  <dig> hpf until the mutants die at 4- <dig> dpf  and is never observed in fgf8a mutants, which develop a slightly curved body axis at  <dig> hpf . the morphology of the caudal fin in ext <dig> mutants remain indistinguishable from control embryos suggesting that the hooked tail phenotype seen in ext2;fgf8a double mutants is not an additive effect of two independent tail phenotypes, but instead the result of a genetic interaction between fgf8a and ext <dig>  in addition, blocking fgf <dig> translation in ext <dig> mutants by injecting  <dig> ng mo2-fgf <dig>  <cit>  results in a similar hooked tail phenotype as ext2;fgf8a double mutants . these observations suggest that ext <dig> is involved in fgf signaling during tail development and support - together with the observed reduction of fgf signaling in the mhb and the reduced expression of fgf signaling target genes in ext <dig> mutants  - the hypothesis that ext <dig> has a general function in fgf signaling in zebrafish after  <dig> hpf.

ext <dig> has a role in wnt signaling during zebrafish development
has ext <dig> also a role in wnt signaling during zebrafish embryonic development? we reasoned that if ext <dig> acts as an enhancer of wnt signaling, ext <dig> mutants with their general reduction in hs content should be more sensitive to a partial reduction in the translation of wnt ligands compared to control embryos. the wnt <dig>  mutant has a characteristic partial fusion of the eyes due to reduced convergent-extension cell movements which impairs anterior movements of the prechordal plate and the ventral forebrain  <cit> . injections of  <dig> ng mo1-wnt <dig> into control embryos have been shown to phenocopy the mutation  <cit> . we tested whether ext <dig> was involved in wnt <dig> function by injecting  <dig> ng mo1-wnt <dig> in the offspring  of adult ext2+/- individuals. in control embryos the injection typically resulted in a characteristic wnt <dig> mutant phenotype with a slight fusion of the eyes . in contrast, injected ext <dig> mutants, identified by their lack of pectoral fins, typically developed a stronger phenotype and 51% of ext <dig> mutants were in fact cyclopic , which was only observed in one control embryo. in an analogous experiment we tested the effect of reducing wnt5b translation in ext <dig> mutants and siblings. injection of  <dig> ng of wnt5-mo <dig> in wt embryos phenocopied the reduction in body length and the hammerhead phenotype characteristic for the wnt5b  mutant  <cit> . when the offspring  of adult ext2+/- individuals were injected with  <dig> ng mo1-wnt5b, the ext <dig> mutants typically phenocopied the wnt5b mutant head and body length phenotype , while the morphology of the injected siblings were almost wt like . thus, in ext <dig> mutants a smaller reduction of wnt <dig> and wnt5b translation is sufficient to specifically interfere with wnt function compared to siblings. this indicates that ext <dig> acts in wnt signaling pathways in zebrafish.

ptc <dig> expression and hh dependent cell differentiation in the zebrafish retina and myotome are normal in ext <dig> mutants
lee and co-workers have reported that expression of the hh receptor ptc <dig>  which is induced in response to hh signaling, is normal during early brain development in ext <dig> mutants  <cit> . we investigated the function of hh signaling after  <dig> hpf, when immunohisochemical staining of hs shows that nothing but traces of hs polysaccharides remain in ext <dig> mutant tissues  <cit>  and data not shown). in contrast to expression of the fgf signaling target gene etv5b , ptc <dig> is normally expressed in ext <dig> mutants at  <dig> hpf  indicating normal hh function. the reduced ptc <dig> expression in the pectoral fin  is caused by a reduction in fgf <dig> signaling capacity  <cit>  and not by defective hh signaling  <cit> . we next asked whether hh signaling correctly induces cell differentiation in ext <dig> mutants during later stages of development. shha  expression between 32- <dig> hpf drives a wave of neurogenesis across the retina and in shha mutants the retinal tissue is poorly differentiated and highly disorganized  <cit> . expression of the proteins isl <dig> and zpr <dig> mark distinct cell populations which are all severely reduced in the retina of shha mutants at  <dig> hpf  <cit> . when ext <dig> mutants were studied, we found that retinal cell differentiation in these embryos is indistinguishable from that in control embryos where the retina develops normal cellular layers . another well studied function of hh signaling is in cell differentiation in the zebrafish myotome where muscle cell differentiation is regulated by hh signaling  <cit> . eng1a expression in muscle pioneers in the myotome can be regarded as a readout for hh signaling  <cit>  and eng1a expression in the myotome is similar in ext <dig> mutants and siblings from segmentation to hatching . we therefore conclude that hh signaling induces normal expression of ptc <dig> in ext <dig> mutants and that hh dependent cell differentiation in the retina and the myotome is normal.

in contrast to fgf and wnt signaling, hh signaling is not sensitized in ext <dig> mutants
we next investigated whether hh signaling in ext <dig> mutants is more susceptible to a reduction in hh expression than in control embryos, in a similar way to the results presented above for fgf and wnt signaling. nasevisius and co-workers have reported that inhibiting hh function in zebrafish embryos by injecting a shha  translation blocking morpholino  results in embryos with u-shaped somites  <cit>  which phenocopies the somite phenotype of the shha mutants  <cit> . we injected  <dig> ng mo1-shha morpholino in offspring  derived from crossings of heterozygous ext2+/- individuals, and we scored the presence of u-shaped somites in ext <dig> mutants at  <dig> dpf . however, mo1-shha injected ext <dig> mutants displayed a similar proportion of individuals with u-shaped somites as siblings . repeating the experiment with  <dig> ng of mo1-shha morpholino  resulted in fewer individuals with u-shaped somites but the proportion of ext <dig> mutants and siblings with u-shaped somites was still similar . even a lower concentration of mo1-shha morpholino  did not result in any individuals with u-shaped somites. taken together, these data indicate that the mo1-shha is equally effective in inducing u-shaped somites in ext <dig> mutants as in siblings.

in another experiment we tested hh signaling in ext <dig> mutants for its sensitivity to cyclopamine, a drug which blocks hh signaling by direct binding to the hh signal transduction component smoothened  <cit> . if hh signaling was less robust as a result of lowered hs content in ext <dig> mutants, it should be possible to block the expression of the hh signaling downstream target ptc <dig> with a lower concentration of cyclopamine in ext <dig> mutants than in the siblings. however, when we treated the offspring  from crossings between adult heterozygous ext <dig> mutant carriers with  <dig> μm cyclopamine 32- <dig> hpf, ptc <dig> expression was similarly reduced at  <dig> hpf in both ext <dig> mutants  and siblings . repeating this experiment with  <dig> μm cyclopamine did not result in an apparent reduction in ptc <dig> expression in either ext <dig> mutants or siblings and taken together these data indicate that cyclopamine is equally effective in reducing ptc <dig> expression in ext <dig> mutants and siblings. we finally tested whether ext <dig> and shha interact genetically by crossing the ext2tw25e allele into the shhat <dig> background. to reduce the shha gene dose in ext <dig> mutants we crossed heterozygous ext2+/-;shha+/- double carriers with ext2+/- carriers resulting in 50% of ext <dig> mutants lacking one functional shha gene. we reasoned that if the reduced gene dose of ssha in ext <dig> mutant did affect hedgehog signaling, then 50% of the isolated ext <dig> mutants in this cross would display changes in ptc <dig> expression. however, ptc <dig> expression was indistinguishable in all ext <dig> mutants at  <dig> hpf  and  <dig> hpf  indicating that one or two copies of a functional shha gene did not affect hedgehog signaling in ext <dig> mutants.

we conclude that reducing hh signaling in ext <dig> mutants by several different methods does not affect expression of hh signaling target genes or the severity of morphological phenotypes associated with defective hh signaling. this is in strong contrast to fgf and wnt signaling. taken together these data suggest that ext <dig> differently modulates the function of hs binding paracrine signaling factors.

discussion
in this study we present evidence for differences in the role of ext <dig> in fgf, wnt and hh signaling during zebrafish embryo development. while ext <dig> functions as an enhancer of fgf and wnt signaling, hh signaling is apparently not affected by the decreased hs levels caused by the ext <dig> deficiency.

fgf signaling in ext <dig> mutants
we previously reported that ext <dig> is required for fgf <dig> signaling but not for fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> signaling during limb bud development, which suggested that different fgfs have specific requirements for hspgs in vivo  <cit> . in this study we addressed the follow up question of whether ext <dig> has a general role in fgf signaling. we show that the two fgf signaling target genes pea <dig> and etv5b are reduced in tissues other than the developing limb and that all remaining expression in the mutants is sensitised for inhibition of fgf signaling. for example, in the mhb where fgf <dig> is not expressed, pea <dig> and etv5b expression are reduced in ext <dig> mutants at  <dig> hpf . fgf <dig> is a key mediator of mhb signaling and mice with the conditionally disrupted ext <dig> gene, encoding one component of the hs copolymerase complex ext1/ext <dig>  <cit> , exhibit reduced hs polymerization in the brain and display similar abnormal expression of fgf and engrailed proteins  <cit>  as ext <dig> mutants . mhb expression of etv5b and pea <dig> is reduced in ext <dig> mutants at  <dig> hpf  but marker genes of mhb signaling such as fgf8a and eng1a are not generally reduced until  <dig> hpf , suggesting that a reduction in fgf signaling precedes and possibly causes the reduction in mhb signaling at  <dig> hpf. notably, the patterning of the mhb contains several feedback loops  and the reduced fgf signaling in mhb of ext <dig> mutants  might well cause a complex mispatterning of this tissue. notably, although eng1a expression is subsequently reduced in the mhb, it is never absent  indicating that the mhb retains some signaling activity during embryo development. moreover, in zebrafish, both fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> are required to promote posterior mesodermal development. removal of both gene functions significantly impairs development of posterior tissues  <cit> . the tail development in ext <dig> mutants is disturbed when either fgf <dig> or fgf <dig> is removed  which suggests a role for ext <dig> in maintaining fgf signaling pathways. taken together, our data suggest that ext <dig> acts as a general enhancer of fgf signaling after  <dig> hpf.

mechanism of reduction of fgf signaling in ext <dig> mutant
so, by which mechanism is fgf signaling reduced in ext <dig> mutants? hs binds to both fgf ligands and receptors and facilitates receptor dimerization  <cit> . in the most straightforward model, the reduced level of hs in the ext <dig> mutants would result in the formation of fewer signaling fgf receptor dimers. however, the observation that etv5b expression is more greatly reduced than pea <dig> expression , suggests more complex mechanisms. during zebrafish development, etv5b is expressed further away from cells expressing fgf ligands than pea <dig>  suggesting that cells typically require less fgf ligands to elicit etv5b than pea <dig> expression  <cit> . therefore, if the only mechanism for reduction of fgf signaling in ext <dig> mutants was a decreased participation of hs in ligand/receptor complexes, then pea <dig> expression would be expected to be more reduced than etv5b expression. in fact, the opposite was observed . a role for hspgs in fgf transport, as has previously been described for wnt and hh transport  <cit> , could possibly explain this result. if hs participates in fgf transport, then cells positioned at greater distances from fgf expressing cells, such as many etv5b expressing cells, would be exposed to a lower concentration of fgf ligands, resulting in the observed effect in etv5b expression . in contrast, pea <dig> is normally only expressed in cells close to fgf expressing cells and would be less affected by reduced fgf transport . it should also be remembered that hspgs, as well as fgf receptors and ligands, interact with a large number of extracellular molecules  <cit>  and the mechanisms by which ext <dig> enhances fgf signaling might turn out to be complex.

wnt signaling in ext <dig> mutants
in drosophila, sotv  and other ext genes are necessary for normal wt function during wing development  <cit> , but no study has yet reported a role for vertebrate ext genes in wnt signaling. however, indirect evidence suggests that hs biosynthesis is necessary for vertebrate wnt function since the hspg glypican is required for vertebrate wnt signaling  <cit> . topoczewski and co-workers have shown that the zebrafish glypican gpc <dig>  potentiates non-canonical wnt signaling and removal of gpc <dig> in the wnt <dig> mutant silberblick  is correlated with defective anterior extension of midline cells, leading to failure of eye field separation and cyclopia. however, the glypican core protein can promote paracrine signaling independent of hs modification  <cit> . our results demonstrate that inhibition of wnt <dig> translation in ext <dig> mutants phenocopies  the gpc4-/-;wnt11-/- double mutant eye phenotype  <cit>  suggesting that it is indeed the hs modification of gpc <dig> that exhibit the wnt signaling promoting function. we also studied the function of wnt5b in ext <dig> mutants. wnt5b is known to physically interact with the the zebrafish glypican gpc <dig>  <cit>  and the wnt5b mutant pipetail  displays defects in axis elongation and cartilage differentiation which can be phenocopied by injection of a morpholino that blocks the wnt5b translation  <cit> . we found that a partial reduction of wnt5b translation, insufficient to interfere with wnt5b function in control embryos , still elicits the shorter body axis and hammerhead-like phenotype of ppt mutants  <cit>  when injected in ext <dig> mutants . our data thus shows that ext <dig> potentiates vertebrate wnt signaling and support the hypothesis that defects in wnt5b function could be the explanation for the similar chondrocyte stacking phenotype in wnt5b and ext <dig> mutants  <cit> .

hh signaling in ext <dig> mutants
several studies have shown the requirement for ext <dig>  and other ext genes for proper distribution and signaling activity of hh signaling molecules in drosophila  <cit> . however, in vertebrates the picture is less clear. in mice, the diffusion of ihh during bone development is affected by a reduction of ext <dig> expression  <cit>  but not of ext <dig>  <cit> . previous studies of zebrafish ext <dig> mutants have not found evidence for defective hh signaling during early brain patterning  <cit> , limb development  <cit>  or chondrocyte stacking  <cit> . in this study we find further evidence for the lack of effects on hh signaling in ext <dig> mutants; hh signaling induces normal expression of the target gene ptc <dig> in ext <dig> mutants and hh dependent cell differentiation in the retina and myotome is identical in control and ext <dig> mutants. in addition, control and ext <dig> mutant embryos respond to the same extent to reduction of hh signaling, when hh target gene expression and phenotypes associated with defective hh signaling are studied. since ext <dig> mutants have a fraction of the normal hs content in their tissues  <cit> , we cannot exclude the possiblility that an even stronger reduction of hspg biosynthesis would affect hh signaling in zebrafish or even that more subtle aspects of hh signaling are in fact altered in ext <dig> mutants. however, we conclude that, in comparison to the significant role for ext <dig> in fgf and wnt signaling, hh signaling is virtually independent of ext <dig> function.

ext <dig> modulates the function of specific hs binding signaling factors differently
hspg biosynthesis is spatially and temporally varied during embryonic development  <cit>  and numerous studies have suggested the possibility of instructive functions for hs biosynthesis in paracrine signaling . our results suggest that genes which, like ext <dig>  affect the hs content in tissues, are far more likely to regulate fgf and wnt signaling than hh signaling. the explanation for the abnormal hh function in mice with reduced ext <dig> expression  <cit>  - but not in mice or zebrafish with reduced ext <dig> expression  - might be that hs polymerization is more effectively reduced by a reduction in ext <dig> than ext <dig>  alternatively, since relative expression levels of mouse ext <dig> and ext <dig> have distinct effects on subsequent hspg sulfation  <cit>  and hh signaling is disturbed in mice with abnormal hs structures  <cit> , it is possible that hh signaling is sensitive to putative abnormal hs structure caused by ext <dig> but not ext <dig> deficiency. expression of ext <dig> is ubiquitous during zebrafish development  <cit>  but it is interesting to note that ext <dig> genes exhibits specific spatial and temporal expression  <cit> , indicating that hs levels and structure might vary according to specific effects on fgf, wnt and hh signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
most paracrine signaling factors bind to hspgs and genes affecting polymerization of hs are generally assumed to have important but permissive roles for paracrine signaling. in this study we have found an unexpected specificity in how zebrafish ext <dig> affects the function of paracrine signaling factors, suggesting possible instructive functions for genes regulating hs polymerization during animal development.
