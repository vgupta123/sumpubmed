BACKGROUND
insertion sequencing  is a technique for high throughput forward genetic screening that has recently become a favorable approach to studying gene function at the genome scale  <cit> . inseq relies on the use of next-generation dna sequencing to audit the presence of hundreds of thousands of unique transposon insertions present in a pool of mutants that collectively saturate that organism’s genome with transposition events . in general, inseq based methods can use two different methods to analyze gene function. the first relies on sequencing the transposon insertions sites in an input pool and an output pool of transposon mutants, and using the differential representation of mutants in each pool to infer the functional role of each gene with sufficient representation of insertion sites  <cit> . the second method relies on creating a mutant pool sufficiently large and complex that it saturates the genome and allows for analysis of regions with statistically fewer, or no, insertions than expected using a non-parametric  <cit> , bayesian model  <cit> , or hidden markov model  based analysis  <cit> . both approaches have been applied to several species of bacteria to investigate genes involved in colonization of hosts , resistance to antibiotics  <cit> , characterizing metabolic pathways  <cit> , deducing core essential genomes , and recently, examining genes involved in colonizing soil environments  <cit> .

the rhizobiaceae is a family of alpha-proteobacteria containing three agriculturally important genera of soil bacteria: rhizobium, sinorhizobium and agrobacterium  <cit> . members in these genera share a unique relationship with plant hosts. rhizobium, and sinorhizobium are both able to enter into an endosymbiotic mutualism with certain species of leguminous plants, in which the rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into a biologically available form for the plant in return for fixed carbon and energy  <cit> . this symbiosis is particularly important in the context of agriculturally produced pulse crops, where the rhizobium legume symbiosis affords farmers the ability to reduce the rate of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers application  <cit> . conversely, the relationship of agrobacterium with its plant host is parasitic. in this symbiosis, agrobacterium infects the tissues of a plant host and transforms specific virulence genes into the host’s dna, resulting in tumorgenic growth with altered cellular metabolism that the bacteria then colonize  <cit> . the formation of several galls at the stem root interface results in a plant infection known as crown gall, that can have a significant impact on the crop yield of stone fruits, berries, and nuts  <cit> .

genetic research in rhizobium, sinorhizobium, and agrobacterium has relied heavily on the use of transposon mutagenesis screens. perhaps the most commonly used transposon in the rhizobiaceae is the tn <dig> transposon . the use of tn <dig> genetic screens is numerous and has helped to elucidate genes involved in metabolism , desiccation tolerance  <cit> , and cell envelope physiology  <cit>  for example. implementation of transposon mutagenesis with the high-throughput techniques of inseq promise to accelerate the rate at which genetic research in the rhizobiaceae is currently performed. furthermore, it would allow for comprehensive genome screens for genes involved in host interactions, metabolism, survival, and possibly plasmid maintenance, under any testable condition.

the mariner class of transposon is a host independent transposon that unlike the random insertion transposons such as tn <dig> is known to specifically insert into an organism's genome at thymine-adenine  motifs  <cit> . because of this defined insertion preference, transposition events can be modeled in silico in any sequenced genome to understand the defined number of insertion locations that exist. this type of analysis can be further refined to examine insertions per gene or within any defined region of interest in the genome. furthermore, using a transposon with a defined number of insertion loci allows for robust statistical analysis when used in a transposon insertion sequencing methodology. one such analysis package uses a hmm to predict the essentiality of every gene under a particular growth condition in an organism’s genome given a sufficiently dense inseq data set  <cit> . the advantages of this type of analysis is that it does not solely rely on the comparison of an input and output pool of mutants as it uses statistical inference on a defined number of insertion sites to infer an over represented or under represented number of insertions within a given region.

here we describe the modification of a previous inseq mutagenesis vector psam_bt, which uses a mariner class transposon with modified ir elements, to selectively capture 15– <dig> bp of genomic dna adjacent to the transposon insertion  <cit> . the dna fragment is then processed for next-generation dna sequencing. the new inseq vector uses a rhizobiaceae specific promoter to drive the expression of the plasmid-borne transposase, and has had the erythromycin resistance gene cassette replaced with a neomycin resistance gene cassette  for ease of selection in the rhizobiaceae. the host range of transposition with psam_rl was examined and an inseq experiment was performed on the model organism rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig>  to examine the insertion density that the psam_rl transposon could achieve. furthermore, the functionality of the transposon in rlv <dig> for inseq was also examined.

RESULTS
construction of psam_rl and transposition frequency within the rhizobiaceae
the mmei-adapted mariner transposon suicide delivery vector psam_rl was constructed from a previously described mmei-adapted mariner delivery vector psam_bt  <cit> . to do so, the  <dig> bp eryr in psam_bt was replaced with a  <dig> bp neo/kanr resistance cassette from psc <dig> and the  <dig> bp bacteroides thetaiotaomicron rpod promoter region was replaced with a  <dig> bp rlv <dig> rpod promoter region. a map of the psam_rl construct is shown in figure  <dig>  with restriction enzyme sites used for cloning indicated. the psam_rl construct was maintained in e. coli strain sm10λpir as this strain harbours both the λpir gene, required for the replication of r6kƴ orir, and chromosomally integrated tra genes, required for conjugative transfer via the plasmid borne rp4-orit. analysis of the transposition frequency of the psam_rl mariner transposon was evaluated via conjugative transfer of the psam_rl suicide vector from e. coli sm10λpir into r. leguminosarum, s. meliloti, and a. tumefaciens. transposition frequency was highest in rlv <dig>  yielding an average of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> transposon mutants per recipient cell. the frequencies of transposition in a. tumefaciens and s. meliloti were observed to be  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mutants per recipient cells, respectively.figure  <dig>

analysis of psam_rl transposition in the rlv <dig> genome
analysis of psam_rl transposon integration was performed using three independent pools of ~ <dig>  ×  <dig> transposon mutants. mutant pools were grown for approximately  <dig> generations  on ty basal medium. the mutants were collected en masse and the 15– <dig> bp of genomic dna adjacent to the transposon insertion was sequenced using a modified inseq method on the ion torrent pgm. transposon insertion sequences from the three replicate samples were then pooled and aligned onto the rlv <dig> genome, resulting in  <dig> , <dig> usable transposon insertion tags  for analysis with the transposon hmm  python module  <cit> . from in silico analysis it was calculated that  <dig>  potential mariner transposon insertion sites existed within the rlv <dig> genome. of these,  <dig>  unique transposon insertions were observed in the composite data collected from the three psam_rl mutant pools grown on ty agar. this corresponded to an overall insertion density of 83% in the rlv <dig> genome, with insertion density across replicons ranging between 68% to 88% . the mean read count per mariner insertion site, observed to have a transposon insert, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  sequence reads per insertion across all replicons with the median read count per insertion ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads per insertion .table  <dig>

distribution of phenotypic classes throughout the rlv <dig> genome
each rlv <dig> replicon was analyzed using the tn-hmm python module  <cit>  to classify genes based on the observed density of tn insertions in each gene within the mixed mutant cell population. for example, a gene which had no detectable tn insertion sites following dna sequencing from the pooled mutant dna suggests cells carrying a mutation in this gene were not maintained in the population. these genes are described as conferring an essential phenotype. the procedure is described in greater detail in the materials and methods.

the seven replicons of rlv <dig> were analyzed separately to account for variations in mean read depth, insertion density, and median read count between the replicons that may have been a result of their independent replication within the cell. across all replicons  <dig> % of the genes were observed to have a neutral or negligible impact on the ability of rlv <dig> to grow on ty medium when disrupted by the transposon . genes identified as conferring a phenotype classification of essential, growth-defective, and growth-advantage were observed to represent  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the genes within the genome, respectively. throughout the genome,  <dig> genes contained no 'ta' transposon insertions sites and as such could not be assigned to a growth effect state. however this represents only  <dig> % of the total predicted genes within the genome .table  <dig>

discussion
high throughput forward genetic screening is rapidly being adopted in a diverse range of organisms. inseq, and similar high-throughput techniques, have been used in several bacterial species, including salmonella  <cit> , mycobacterium  <cit> , haemophilus  <cit> , vibrio  <cit> , pseudomonas  <cit> , chronobacteria  <cit>  and bacillus  <cit> . the technique is very attractive as it allows for the high-throughput functional screening of an organism's genome under varied growth conditions. here we present the design and validation of a transposon mutagenesis system that will allow for the application of high-throughput inseq genetic screening for use within the rhizobiaceae.

transposon mutagenesis with psam_rl in rlv3841
we have successfully demonstrated the implementation of a mariner class transposon to mutagenize selected species within the family rhizobiaceae. we found that the mmei-adapted mariner transposon harbored on psam_rl could mutagenize r. leguminosarum, a. tumefaciens, and s. meliloti at a high frequency. in the case of rlv <dig>  it was observed that this high frequency of mutagenesis was dense enough to generate saturating libraries of transposon insertion mutants. we were able to generate transposon mutant libraries that saturated the rlv <dig> genome with an insertion density of  <dig> , which is higher then the insertion density of the data set used for validation of the hmm used for analysis  <cit> . this suggests that the combination of mariner based transposon insertion sequencing with the bayesian based hmm analysis would yield accurate and full genome level results. furthermore, our analysis used approximately  <dig>  m reads. and increased read depth could help increase confidence in the analysis, particularly in resolving the phenotypic classifications of essential and growth defective.

we also observed no bias of mariner transposon insertion across the rlv <dig> chromosome and plasmids, suggesting that the transposon inserts randomly and therefore should allow for reliable whole-genome screening approaches. analysis of read depth showed that there was also little bias in mean read-count per insertion, except in the case of prl <dig>  which was slightly higher than the other replicons. we suggest that this is a result of prl <dig> being maintained at a higher copy number than the other megaplasmids and chromosome, and so sampling of the mutant pool dna would results in a higher sampling of prl <dig> transposon insertion tags than the other plasmids, or chromosome. when the increase in mean read counts is taken into consideration with the insertion density, it appears that although the higher copy number of prl <dig> resulted in a higher mean read depth, it did not increase the insertions density, suggesting that the saturation of prl <dig> had reached a plateau and an increased presence of prl <dig> did not result in a corresponding increase in the number of unique insertions sites.

analysis of rlv <dig> inseq using a hidden markov model
analysis of the ty inseq data set with the tn-hmm analysis package assigned accurate phenotypic classification to several genes thought to be essential housekeeping genes necessary for growth under normal conditions. the analysis showed that insertions in genes required for atp synthesis were absent in the mutant pools. these genes are expected to be essential due to their central role in metabolism and their designation as essential in this assay supports the validity of using the mmei-adapted mariner in conjunction with the hmm analysis as our inseq methodology. furthermore, visual investigation of the transposon insertion density around the region encoding the atp synthase genes revealed a high insertion density leading up to and after the genes, further supporting the conclusion that the technique is robust and can discern regions of essentiality from those of other states at a high resolution.

in a few instances, a gene expected to be essential was observed to be neutral. rl <dig> is annotated as a putative dna polymerase iii alpha sub-unit, and is therefore predicted to be required for proper dna polymerase function; however, the gene was classified in the neutral category with  <dig> % of all potential insertion sites in the locus observed to have insertions. we suggest that rl <dig> may be misanotated, as rl <dig>  another dna polymerase iii alpha subunit, was observed to be essential . this highlights another potential use of inseq in the rhizobiaceae for validation and quality improvement of genome annotations.

five of the megaplasmids in the rlv <dig> genome were observed to have a set of  <dig> plasmid replication genes that the inseq approach identified as essential for plasmid replication and maintenance. the exception was prl <dig> which has two sets of replication genes  <cit>  and therefore functional redundancy may have complicated the the classification of the prl <dig> rep genes into the phenotypic classes. the classification of the rep genes on each plasmid as essential provides validation of the inseq method. tn insertion within a replication locus would result in the loss of the plasmid from the mutant cell populations harvested for dna extraction and inseq dna sequencing. this result highlights the value of the inseq approach in the genetic characterization of novel plasmids, as the method is able to identify plasmid encoded genes that are required for plasmid replication and maintenance. furthermore the method can identify plasmid-encoded genes that provide a fitness advantage to the host under specific growth conditions based on an observed low tn insertion density.

the genes from previously described mutants with growth defects on ty medium were also examined. previous work identified  <cit>  several genes that are important for growth on ty medium. when we compared those results with the results produced by the inseq analysis of rlv <dig> grown on ty medium we observed good concordance with these previously published results. in our results, the four ty related genes were all observed to result in a growth-defective phenotype after ~ <dig> generations of growth, which is in agreement that the interruption of these genes via mutagenesis will result in impaired growth on ty.

CONCLUSIONS
the construction and validation of the mariner psam_rl transposon delivery vector as a transposon insertion sequencing tool for use in the rhizobiziaceae will provide an opportunity for researchers in the rhizobiaceae community to use a new high throughput genetic screening approach. there are many research opportunities within the rhizobiaceae that could be examined using the inseq methodology. for example, use of a inseq approach in rhizobia to study genes required for rhizosphere colonization and plant infection will help to understand the competition problem observed in inoculant strains, by not only identifying new essential rhizosphere colonization genes, but also identifying mutations that provide a phenotypic growth advantage . furthermore, the use of inseq could be used to fully elucidate catabolic pathways, if saturating mutant pools were grown on minimal medium given a single carbon source, and contrasted with the results of similar experiments on rich media. in the near term, we will use the inseq approach to increase our understanding of the gene networks involved in swarming physiology in rlv <dig>

construction of psam_rl
plasmid dna was isolated using genelute™ plasmid miniprep kit . the neo/kanr cassette within psc <dig>  <cit>  was pcr amplified using primers tn189kmr_fwd_xhoi and tn189_rev_xbai  such that the xhoi and xbai restriction enzyme sites were introduced on the 5’ and 3’ end, respectively. the  <dig> bp neo/kanr pcr product was subsequently cloned into the pgem®-t easy vector system creating plasmid pgem::189kmr. the neo/kanr cassette in pgem::189kmr was digested with xhoi and xbai restriction enzymes creating a  <dig> bp fragment that was directionally cloned into the psam_bt mariner transposon. the resulting plasmid psam_km was maintained in the e. coli strain pir <dig>  which allows for high copy number maintenance of r6kƴ-orir plasmids.

cloning of the rlv <dig> rpod promoter region was carried out by pcr amplifying a  <dig> bp region upstream of the rpod gene start codon using primers rlv_rpod_pro_fwd and rlv_rpod_pro_rev . the rpod promoter pcr product had a 5’ bamhi and 3’ ndei restriction enzyme site introduced, and was subsequently cloned into the pgem®-t easy vector system to create the plasmid pgem::rpod. the rlv <dig> rpod promoter region was then excised from pgem::rpod using ndei and bamhi, and directionally cloned into psam_km to create the vector psam_rl . the new psam_rl suicide vector carried an mmei-adapted mariner transposon harbouring a neor/kanr cassette, and had the himar1c <dig> transposase transcriptionally fused to a rlv <dig> rpod promoter. for use in transposon mutagenesis, the psam_rl construct was electroporated into e. coli sm10λpir .

testing psam_rl transposition frequency
transposition mutagenesis using psam_rl was done in triplicate. donor and recipient cells were grown in broth culture to an od <dig> of approximately  <dig>  and were pooled in a ratio of  <dig> μl recipient to  <dig> μl of donor in a  <dig>  ml microcentrifuge tube. the conjugation mixture was pelleted at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min, washed once with  <dig> μl 1x pbs, and resuspended in approximately  <dig> μl 1x pbs. the cell suspensions were then spotted onto pre-warmed ty agar plates and incubated at 30°c overnight. conjugation spots were scraped and resuspended in  <dig> μl of 1x pbs. enumeration of transposon mutants was done using ty agar supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml neo and the appropriate rhizobiaceae counter selectable antibiotic . enumeration of total rhizobiaceae was done on ty agar with the species specific selectable antibiotic.

generating transposon mutant libraries for sequencing
six independent conjugations of psam_rl into rlv <dig> were conducted on ty agar as described above. after  <dig> hours incubation at 30°c each of  <dig> mating spot was scraped and resuspended in  <dig> ml of 1x pbs and then pooled together in a final volume of  <dig> ml. for selection on ty agar,  <dig> μl of resuspended cells were plated across  <dig> separate  <dig> ×  <dig> mm <dig>  neo + str ty agar plates, in triplicate and incubated for ~ <dig> hour at 30°c.

following incubation, a faint film like growth was scraped off each plate and resuspended in  <dig> ml of 1×pbs, vortexed for  <dig> minutes, and then pelleted at  <dig>   <dig> rpm for  <dig> minutes. the supernatant of each resuspension was very viscous and still contained cells, it was equally aliquoted into  <dig> ×  <dig>  ml microcentrifuge tubes. the original pellet, and two tubes of supernatant, were then brought up to a final volume of  <dig> μl with  <dig> m nacl, vortexed thoroughly, and incubated on ice for  <dig> h to disrupt the viscous exopolysaccharide diffuse capsule to better collect the cells. the nacl cell suspensions were then pelleted at  <dig>   <dig> rpm for  <dig> minutes, and the pellets from each replicate were pooled independently and resuspended in  <dig> μl of te buffer . the resulting  <dig> mutant pools were used for independent dna isolation and downstream library preparation.

preparing sequencing libraries and dna sequencing
transposon insertion tags  consisted of  <dig> bp of psam_rl transposon sequence, including the  <dig> bp inverse repeat sequence, and 15– <dig> bp of adjacent genomic dna. library preparation was carried out independently for each of the  <dig> collected tn-mutant pools. tn-tags were prepared for dna sequencing using a modified version of the inseq method  <cit>  to make the sequencing process amendable to the ion torrent pgm sequencing platform. linear pcr products were amplified using the primer ion torrent biosam , with an annealing temperature of  <dig> °c and  <dig> ng of template dna. linear pcr products were purified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit  according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. the biotinylated linear pcr products were then bound to pierce streptavidin magnetic beads  and enzymatic steps during library preparation were performed as described  <cit>  with the substitution of klenow , random primer  <dig>  and t <dig> dna ligase . additionally, a custom library adapter, inseq_adpt, was used in the adapter ligation step. the final pcr amplification of sequencing template was accomplished using fusion primers designed in accordance with ion amplicon library preparation , using the pcr amplification conditions described in the inseq methodology  <cit> . the forward fusion primers it_a_fp_ <dig>  it_a_fp_ <dig>  and it_a_fp_ <dig> included ionxpress barcode sequences  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> respectively, for downstream sequence separation. the reverse primer it_trp1_fp was used in conjunction with a forward primer to introduce the trp <dig> sequencing adapter. the final sequencing template prepared from the ion amplicon library preparation was  <dig> bp in length. sequencing template was gel purified using the invitrogen e-gel® sizeselect™ system, and was analyzed using a bioanalyzer high sensitivity dna chip  prior to sequencing for quality and molarity. the three technical replicates had a final concentration of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ul of sequencing library after size selection, respectively.

dna sequencing was performed on the ion torrent pgm using 200 bp sequencing chemistry and a 316v <dig> sequencing chip. the total raw sequencing output of the ion torrent was  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  million reads for each of the  <dig> replicates. the raw sequencing reads were then pooled for downstream data extraction an analysis.

data extraction and transposon insertion analysis
quality trimming to q <dig> and trimming of adapter sequences was performed using cutadapt  <cit>  and the final 16– <dig> bp tn-tags were checked for a leading 'ta' motif using a custom python script. the resulting  <dig> , <dig> transposon insertion tags were mapped to the r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> reference genome   <cit>  using the bowtie short read aligner  <cit> , allowing for no mismatches in the alignment, and only reporting insertion tags that mapped to a single unique location. short read alignment resulted in  <dig> , <dig> unique transposon insertion tags mapping to the rlv <dig> reference genome, after  <dig>  reads were ommitted due to multiple alignments, and  <dig>  reads failed to align. the .sam output file from the bowtie alignment was converted into a .bam format using samtools  <cit> , and was then converted to .bed format using bedtools. transposon insertion reads were grouped by specific rlv <dig> replicons for downstream analysis. the .bed files of the aligned transposon insertion tags were converted to .wig format using a custom python module developed in house. the .wig formatted inseq data sets generated for each of the  <dig> replicons in the rlv <dig> genome were then analyzed independently using the tn-hmm python module  <cit> . briefly, the python module used a hmm as described in  <cit> , in conjunction with the viterbi algorithm to calculate the state of each 'ta' insertion site within the genome, independent of gene boundaries. next, the computer module analyzed the state of successive 'ta' sites within gene boundaries to assign a state for the gene as a whole . four phenotypic classifications are possible: essential, growth defective, neutral, and growth advantage. figure  <dig> provides a visual example of the four phenotypic classifications found within a selected region of the rlv <dig> genome.figure  <dig>
