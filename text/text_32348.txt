BACKGROUND
zinc finger proteins  are an important class of transcription factors. zinc finger domains are the important feature of zfps, which consist of various numbers of cysteine  and histidine residues  combined with zinc ions  <cit> . based on the number and location of these residues, zfps are classified into c2h <dig>  c2hc, c2hc <dig>  c3hc <dig>  ccch, c2c <dig>  c4hc <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> groups  <cit> . versatile zfps can bind dna, rna, proteins, and lipids to participate in the activities of an organism. c2h <dig> zfps are involved in different stages of plant growth and development and in various stress responses . plants possess a class containing the lsd <dig> zinc finger domain of the gene called the lsd1-like gene family, which is typically characterized by the presence of one to three lsd1-like zinc finger domains . the lsd1-ke genes were found to be important in programmed cell death  and responses against diseases  <cit> . furthermore, the arabidopsis lsd <dig> gene responds to superoxide dismutase  signals, and suppresses pcd via atlsd <dig> by upregulating the cu/zn-sod gene to mit cell death proferation  <cit> . zat <dig>  a zinc finger of a. thaana, is a dual-function transcriptional regulator that positively regulates primary root growth, but negatively regulates ni <dig> tolerance  <cit> . the talol <dig> gene contains three typical lsd1-ke zinc finger domains. qrt—pcr analysis showed that talol <dig> is upregulated in early stripe rust infection, indicating the involvement of wheat stripe rust-induced defense responses  <cit> .

to date, the zfp transcription factor family in rice  has been a huge focus of stress research. after searching through the ncbi, gramene, and plant tfdb databases, we acquired the sequence data of  <dig> rice zfp genes in  <dig> rice chromosomes. among them, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contain  <dig> and  <dig> zfp genes, respectively. several ztp gene functions have been characterized. a previous study showed that the zfp gene results in certain yields and traits under abiotic stress related to cultivated rice  <cit> . for example, rice zfp <dig> is low-temperature and drought stress-related  <cit> . overexpression of zfp <dig> in tobacco or rice increases tolerance for nacl stress, thereby suggesting that c2h2-zfp <dig> may be involved in the response of plants to salt stress  <cit> . overexpression of ostop6a <dig> increases tolerance for nacl and mannitol stress in a. thaliana  <cit> . oszfp <dig> expression is induced during the cold season, drought, and upon exposure to h2o <dig> stress  <cit> . oslsd <dig> gene over-expression can accelerate the differentiation of the callus and promote chlorophyll b accumulation in transgenic plants. antisense transgenic plants oslsd <dig> are characterized by spontaneous necrotic lesions, enhanced disease resistance, and upregulated pr <dig> gene expression  <cit> . oslol <dig> has two lsd1-ke zinc finger domains, and is important in rice growth and disease resistance. over-expression of oslol <dig> in transgenic rice significantly improves bacterial bight resistance. over-expressing transgenic tobacco enhances bacterial wilt disease and pseudomonas syringae resistance  <cit> . however, studies on salt tolerance in the gene oslol <dig> remain mited to date. in the present study, the oslol <dig> gene from rice leaves of cultivar longjing <dig>  was cloned using rt-pcr, and the mrna expression levels under sa treatment were detected by using qrt-pcr and transgenic techniques. this study aimed to reveal the mechanisms of the oslol <dig> gene in regulating rice responses to sa stress.

functional analysis of oslol <dig> in arabidopsis
using primer pair oslol5-p <dig>  the oslol <dig> pcr product was ligated into the expression vector pcxsn after xcmi digestion  <cit> . for arabidopsis transformation, the pcxsn::oslol <dig>  vectors were first introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens gv <dig> by electroporation. arabidopsis cv col- <dig> plants were transformed via floral dip method as previously described  <cit> . arabidopsis transgenic seeds were plated on half-strength murashige and skoog  medium containing 25 mg · l− <dig> hygromycin for selection. resistant plants were used for molecular identification. to study the function of oslol <dig> in the abiotic stress response, the transgenic t <dig> generation encoding oslol <dig> driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus  promoter were tested with primer pair oslol5-p <dig> and then used for the following studies. the t <dig>  and wt seeds were sterilized and sowed in 1/ <dig> ms medium for germination for  <dig> d. the seedlings were then transferred to 1/ <dig> ms medium containing  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  or 150 mmol l- <dig> nacl or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6 mmol l- <dig> nahco <dig>  after  <dig> d, the growth phenotype, plant height, fresh weight, and mda content of the seedlings were measured.

alkaline stress tolerance analysis of oslol <dig> in rice
for rice transformation, the pcxsn::oslol <dig> vectors were transferred into a. tumefaciens eha <dig> through electroporation. oslol <dig> was transformed into o. sativa l. ssp. japonica cv. “longjing 11” by using the agrobacterium-mediated co-cultivation method. the transgenic t <dig> generation encoding oslol <dig> driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus  promoter were tested with primer pair oslol5-p <dig>  osolo <dig> expression in transgenic plants was confirmed by using northern blot. three independent t <dig> homologous transgenic lines and the control longjing  <dig> were used for alkaline stress tolerance experiments. for alkaline treatment, concurrent buds were transferred to the stress liquid culture medium containing  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> , and 10 mmol l- <dig> nahco <dig>  after  <dig> d, the growth phenotype, root length, fresh weight, and mda content of seedlings were measured. simultaneously, the expression level of oxidative stress response genes osapx <dig> , oscat , oscu/zn-sod , and osrgrc <dig>  were analyzed. procedures for rna extraction and real-time pcr were similar to those described and listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> the primers used in gene clone and qrt-pcr

RESULTS
oslol <dig> is a lsd1-like zinc finger gene
oslol <dig> was successfully cloned using rt-pcr with specific primer pair oslol5-p <dig> from o. sativa l. ssp. cv. “longjing 11” with alkaline stresses then inserted into the pmd18-t vector. sequencing results confirmed that the oslol <dig> sequence was identical to genbank no. aj <dig>  sequence analysis showed that the full-length sequence encoded  <dig> amino acids, with predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of  <dig>  kda and  <dig> , respectively. based on structural properties indicated by smart programs, the predicted protein contains two lsd1-like zinc finger domains. the lsd1-like zinc finger domains contain the sequence c-x2-c-x14-c-x2-c, where x can be any amino acid. the subscripts indicate the number of residues. homology alignment analysis using clustalx software showed that the deduced amino acid sequences were highly similar to several previously isolated lsd1-like zfps in arabidopsis and rice . we also found that oslol <dig> was clustered in the same group with atlol <dig> because they share the highest similarity in terms of identities. therefore, oslol <dig> was determined to be an lsd1-like zfp.

oslol <dig> localized in the nucleus
online analysis tool psort predicted that oslol <dig> would localize in the nucleus and cytoplasm with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % probability, respectively. to verify the prediction, a pbi121::oslol5::gfp plasmid was transformed into onion epidermal cells using gene gun bombardment. cells were cultured for 18–24 h in the dark, and the transformed onion epidermal cells were observed for gfp signals using laser confocal fluorescence microscopy. when driven by promoter 35s, fusion protein oslol5::gfp was expressed in onion epidermal cells with green fluorescence in the nucleus, thereby suggesting that oslol <dig> localized in the nucleus .fig.  <dig> subcellular localization of the 35s::oslol5::gfp fusion protein. a, d gfp, green fluorescence. b, e dic, bright field. c, f merge, green fluorescence, and bright field superposition. nucleus is marked with the red arrow



expression pattern of oslol <dig> under abiotic stress treatments
to obtain an overview of the oslol <dig> expression pattern under different abiotic stress conditions, qrt-pcr was performed to examine its transcript in rice after saline, alkaline, and oxidative stress treatments. oslol <dig> expression was significantly induced in both leaves and roots by 150 mmol l- <dig> nacl treatment. the maximum  <dig> -fold increase compared with the untreated control in leaves occurred 48 h after treatment, but a  <dig> -fold increase compared with the control in roots occurred 24 h after treatment . oslol <dig> was upregulated in leaves and roots subjected to 30 mmol l- <dig> nahco <dig> treatment and peaked after 24 h. oslol <dig> expressions were 19- and 6-fold higher than the untreated control in leaves and roots, respectively . oslol <dig> expression dramatically increased by 25-fold in leaves after 24 h of 5 mmol l- <dig> h2o <dig> treatment compared with the untreated control . however, h2o <dig> treatment had no significant effect in oslol <dig> expression in roots. oslol <dig> was a stress-responsive zfp, and exhibited differential expression patterns in leaves and roots under sa treatments.fig.  <dig> real-time quantitative expression analysis of the oslol <dig> gene under a salt , b alkali , and c oxidative  stress treatments, respectively



oslol <dig> improved yeast tolerance to nahco <dig> and h2o2
to gain a preliminarily understanding of the function of oslol <dig> in abiotic stress, we surveyed growth characteristics of invsc <dig> yeast containing pyes <dig> or pyes2-oslol <dig> under the following stresses:  <dig>   <dig> , and 1 mol · l− <dig> nacl;  <dig>   <dig>  and 40 mmol · l− <dig> nahco3; and  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  mmol · l− <dig> h2o <dig> stress. invsc <dig> yeast cells containing pyes <dig> or pyes2-oslol <dig> were cultured in ypd + galactose media plates supplied with different concentrations of nacl, nahco <dig>  and h2o <dig>  growth conditions were observed after 72 h of incubation at 30 °c . as nahco <dig> and h2o <dig> concentrations increased, yeast transformed with pyes2-oslol <dig> exhibited better growth conditions than control yeast transformed with pyes <dig>  more clones were clearly present in the pyes2-oslol5-transformed yeast, particularly in 40 mmol · l− <dig> nahco <dig> and  <dig>  mmol · l− <dig> h2o <dig>  than in the control pyes2-transformed yeast after dilutions of 10− <dig> and 10− <dig>  however, growth conditions between yes <dig> and yes2-oslol <dig> were not significantly different under nacl treatment. thus, yeast cells expressing oslol <dig> were more resistant to nahco <dig> and h2o <dig> stress.fig.  <dig> analysis of the sensitivity of yeast expressing pyes2::oslol <dig> to a ; b ; and c . the mean dilution rates of ypd were  <dig>  10− <dig>  10− <dig>  10− <dig>  10− <dig>  and 10−5




oslol <dig> overexpression in a. thaliana enhanced sa stress tolerance
to investigate the biological function of oslol <dig> in plants, we overexpressed oslol <dig> in arabidopsis under the control of promoter camv 35s. pcr screening results showed that the oslol <dig> band was detected in five t <dig>  lines , whereas the negative control did not amplify the target gene fragment. these results indicated that the oslol <dig> gene was inserted into the arabidopsis genome. furthermore, northern blot analysis of the t <dig> transgenic lines derived from the five identified t <dig> lines confirmed that oslol <dig> was successfully overexpressed in the arabidopsis genome . three t <dig> lines, namely, t3-# <dig>  -# <dig>  and -# <dig> seedlings, were used for further analysis.

to identify the function of oslol <dig> in stress response, the t <dig> generation oslol5-overexpressing lines were subjected to sa tolerance assay. under standard culture conditions, no noticeable difference was observed between transgenic lines overexpressing oslol <dig> and non-transformed plants. after  <dig> d of nacl treatment, both wt and transgenic plants experienced growth retardation in a dose-dependent manner. however, retardation was more apparent in wt plants than in transgenic plants . moreover, a significant and dramatic difference in fresh weight and root length between the transgenic and wt plants was noted . salt stress can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes. mda content is an indicator of oxidative stress. in the present study, mda levels in transgenic lines decreased significantly compared with those in wt plants .fig.  <dig> analysis of oslol <dig> transgenic plants to nacl treatment. a, b, c, and d show phenotypes of oslol <dig> transgenic and wt lines subjected to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 150 mm nacl treatment, respectively. e, f, and g show fresh weight, endogenous mda levels, and root length changes in oslol <dig> transgenic and wt lines, respectively



similarly, after  <dig> d of treatment, nahco <dig> significantly inhibited both transgenic and wt lines , but the fresh weight of the transgenic lines was significantly higher than that of the wt controls. at high nahco <dig> concentrations , both wt and transgenic plants exhibited chlorosis, but the fresh weight and root length in wt was significantly lower than in oslol <dig> transgenic lines. these results indicated that oslol <dig> played an important role in the stress response, and increased the sa stress tolerance of plants.fig.  <dig> analysis of oslol <dig> transgenic plants under nahco <dig> treatment. a, b, c, and d show phenotypes of oslol <dig> transgenic and wt lines subjected to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6 mmol · l− <dig> nahco <dig> treatment, respectively. e and f show root length and fresh weight in oslol <dig> transgenic and wt lines, respectively



oslol <dig> overexpression in rice increased alkaline stress tolerance
the oslol <dig> gene was introduced in o. sativa l. ssp. cv. “longjing 11” via agrobacterium-mediated transformation under the control of promoter camv 35s. six t <dig> generation  oslol <dig> transgenic lines were identified by pcr . to detect oslol <dig> expression in transgenic rice lines, northern blot was performed on young leaves of transgenic and nt rice. oslol <dig> overexpression in different levels was observed in t <dig> transgenic rice lines # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> . responses of transgenic rice lines  and nt plants to nahco <dig> stress were determined to further investigate the roles of oslol <dig> in rice. under standard culture conditions, no noticeable difference between transgenic lines and nt plants was observed. after  <dig> d of nahco <dig> treatment, nt plants exhibited growth retardation and chlorosis, whereas oslol <dig> overexpression lines exhibited continuous growth and remained green . moreover, a marked difference in both root length, plant height and fresh weight was observed between transgenic and wt plants . these results further indicated that oslol <dig> played an important role in stress response and increased the nahco <dig> stress tolerance of plants.fig.  <dig> analysis of oslol <dig> transgenic rice under nahco <dig> treatment. a shows phenotypes of the oslol <dig> transgenic and nt lines subjected to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , or 10 mmol · l− <dig> nahco <dig> treatment. b and c show identification of oslol <dig> t <dig> and t <dig> lines in rice. d, e, and f show root length, fresh weight, and plant height in oslol <dig> transgenic and nt lines. ** means significant level  by t-test



expression of oxidative stress response genes were enhanced in oslol5-overexpressing rice
sa stress can cause oxidative stress, and oslol5-overexpressing lines show significant alkaline stress tolerance. to verify whether the expression of oxidative stress response genes is also enhanced in these transgenic lines, several oxidative stress response genes  were chosen and compared between nt and oslol5-overexpressing lines in response to nahco <dig> treatment. real-time pcr assay indicated that nahco <dig> stress induced the expression of these genes, and the expression level of oxidative stress response genes in oslol5-overexpressing lines was significantly higher than in nt plants . the expression of oscu/zn-sod genes also were upregulated in the absence of salt stresses. without nahco <dig> treatment, the expressions of most oxidative stress response genes  were still notably higher in the oslol5-overexpressing lines than in nt plants. this finding indicated that oslol <dig> overexpression promoted the constitutive expression of oxidative stress response genes. therefore, higher expression of oxidative stress response genes might also contribute to enhanced stress tolerance of oslol5-overexpressing lines.fig.  <dig> expression of stress-related genes in oslol5-overexpressing and nt rice. total rna was extracted from rice seedlings at the four-leaf stage grown under control and salt treatments. the transcript levels of osapx <dig>  oscat, oscu/zn-sod, and osrgrc <dig> were measured by quantitative real-time pcr under unstressed conditions or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> , and 10 mmol · l− <dig> nahco <dig> for  <dig> d, respectively. data are written as means and standard errors of three replicates. ** show significant differences at p <  <dig>  



discussion
plant growth and development may be influenced by biotic and abiotic stress, such as diseases, insects, low temperatures, drought, high salinity, and wounding. plants have developed many complicated signal transduction and regulatory mechanisms to adapt to environmental changes and to continue to grow and develop under such harsh conditions  <cit> . zfp expression can be induced by the cold season, drought, and h2o <dig> stress. the osisap1aba gene from indian rice coding c2h <dig> zfp is expressed under stress conditions, such as high salt, low temperature, and drought; this behavior indicates the relationship between osisap <dig> and abiotic stress  <cit> . in the present study, the oslol <dig> gene was cloned from rice cv. “longjing11”, which contains two lsd1-like zinc finger domains and shares a high homology with atlol <dig> . this gene has a typical c-x2-c-x14-c-x2-c structure . oslol <dig> not only participated in growth development, but was also affected by pathogenic microorganism stress. oslol <dig> overexpression in tobacco enhances resistance to bacterial wilt and p. syringae  <cit> . oslol <dig> gene expression increased in “longjing11” leaf and longjing root with sa stress , thereby indicating that oslol <dig> was a broad spectrum-resistant transcription factor. stress is usually accompanied with high salinity and numerous reactive oxygen species, which can lead to lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane in plants, mutation, dna strand breaks, and protein damage. oslol <dig> gene expression increased with h2o <dig> stress in rice leaf, which revealed that oslol <dig> may respond to oxidation stress. future studies may consider predicting which gene can regulate expression to improve tolerance for salinity stress. experiments confirmed that “longjing11” oslol <dig> localized and functioned in the nucleus . yeast grows quickly, and its experiment cycle is shorter than in plants; when galactosum is induced, it exhibits high expression efficiency  <cit> . the present study examined the expression of the gal <dig> promoter  <cit>  to establish the yeast invsci oslol <dig>  and enhanced resistance to sa stress . the yeast invsci bacterium grew significantly better than the control strain under nacl, nahco <dig>  and h2o <dig> treatments, particularly under  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> stress. these findings illustrated that oslol <dig> overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for sa stress through active oxygen species.

mpks can directly modulate zat <dig> gene expression through the phosphorylation of transcription factors  <cit> . thirty-four  medicago ccch zinc finger genes have been identified in response to peg- <dig>  nacl, and aba stress conditions  <cit> . the lsd1-like family is a multi-resistance gene family, although studies have shown that transcription factor oslol <dig> is involved in rice growth and disease resistance  <cit> . arabidopsis-transferred oslol <dig> strains showed resistance after  <dig> d compared with wt grown at  <dig>   <dig>  and 150 mmol · l− <dig> nacl stress. under stress treatment, the mda content of transgenic lines was lower than that of wt. oslol <dig> may be involved in photosynthesis because overexpression strains have high chlorophyll contents. overexpression of rice also showed resistance to alkaline salts of nahco <dig> . overexpression of longjing <dig> rice line under  <dig>  mmol · l− <dig> and 10 mmol · l− <dig> stress resulted in significantly higher  height, fresh weight, and chlorophyll content than longjing  <dig>  qrt-pcr detection of rice treated with nahco <dig> showed that osapx <dig>  oscat, oscu/zn-sod, and osrgrc <dig> genes were transcribed. these genes were induced in both transgenic and nt lines, but the increased rate in transgenic lines was much higher than in nt. the highest expression level was observed in osapx <dig>  which was approximately 100-fold of the expression in untreated nt. these results were consistent with results on arabidopsis atlsd <dig> and atlol <dig>  which were controlled by negative and positive ros-mediated signaling pathways, respectively  <cit> . the present study showed that the oslol <dig> genes involved in the ros signaling pathways may combine with the model plant arabidopsis and rice in lds1-type zfp by ros signaling pathways that regulate cell necrosis  <cit> . we speculated that the oslol <dig> active oxygen scavenging system may have coordinating roles. the present study further revealed that oslol <dig> zfp could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the yeast invsci bacterium grew significantly better than the control strain under nacl, nahco <dig>  and h2o <dig> treatments. these findings illustrated that oslol <dig> overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for sa stress through active oxygen species. the present study showed that the oslol <dig> genes involved in the ros signaling pathways may combine with the model plant arabidopsis and rice in lds1-type zfp by ros signaling pathways that regulate cell necrosis. we speculated that the oslol <dig> active oxygen scavenging system may have coordinating roles. the present study further revealed that oslol <dig> zfp could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.
