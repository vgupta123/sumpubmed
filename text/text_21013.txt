BACKGROUND
infection with hepatitis c virus  represents the major cause of liver disease, affecting more than  <dig> million individuals worldwide. after a sub-clinical phase, greater than 80% of patients progress to persistent hcv infection, the leading cause of chronic liver disease associated with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> .

in the last years, microarray technology provided a comprehensive analysis of alterations in gene expression induced by hcv and revealed important processes of virus-host interactions  <cit> . interestingly, microarray studies indicated that hcv stimulates the endogenous type i interferon  pathway as suggested by activation of ifn-stimulated genes   <cit> . recently, it has been proposed that also micrornas , a class of small non-coding regulatory rnas, are involved in the antiviral pathway induced by ifn-β treatment. the synthetic introduction of five ifn-β-induced mirs into hcv replicon cells may simulate the antiviral effect of ifn-β blocking hcv replication and infection. these five mirs  likely induced an antiviral state either through alteration of gene expression and/or directly targeting hcv rna, as was demonstrated for two of them   <cit> .

although hcv activates the endogenous ifn-α/β pathway it conversely shows an impressive ability to induce persistent infections. indeed, it is also clear that hcv has evolved several mechanisms to control the ifn antiviral response, inhibiting the pathway at different levels  <cit> . recently, it has been suggested that an improper pre-activation of isgs in the liver of hcv infected patients may hinder the antiviral response. the discovery of a genetic polymorphism in the interleukin 28b  region on chromosome  <dig> of hcv patients depicted a more complex virus-host interaction. the il28b non-cc variant has been associated with non-response to the ifn therapy and with lower rates of spontaneous clearance of hcv infection. the poor-response variant is also associated with higher intrahepatic expression level of isgs  <cit> .

a missing aspect in this scenario is the study of the effect produced by hcv on the expression of ifn-β-induced mirs. this is a relevant issue to understand how the virus can suppress the innate antiviral signaling and induce a persistent infection.

in a previous paper, we identified a common transcriptional response of huh- <dig> cells to different clones of full-length hcv replicon  <cit> . although a more advanced hcv cell culture models that release hcv viral particles has been developed  <cit> , the replicon system has the advantage of taking into account the cellular gene expression variability of different hcv replicon cell clones. this approach allows searching for modulated genes shared by all clones, which are likely to be strictly needed for viral replication in different cellular contexts.

on this basis, we used the replicon system to identify ifn-regulated mirs that are modulated by hcv rna replication. in particular, we analyzed the expression profile of  <dig> selected mirs in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cell line and in three cell clones carrying a full-length hcv replicon . among the identified  <dig> mirs modulated in the 21- <dig> clone,  <dig> mirs showed concordant expression when analyzed in the two other hcv replicons. by a combined approach, based on bioinformatic prediction and microarray analysis, we also identified  <dig> genes, targeted by the  <dig> mirs, which are involved in pathways and biological processes potentially implicated in the control of antiviral response by hcv infection.

RESULTS
expression of ifn-β-regulated mirs in 21- <dig> hcv replicon cells and in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells
to determine the impact of hcv rna replication and protein synthesis on ifn-β-regulated mirs, we compared the expression profile of selected mirs in 21- <dig> cells, harbouring a full-length hcv genome, and in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells with the huh- <dig> parental cell line.

in particular, the list of assayed mirs includes  eight ifn-β-induced mirs, which displayed complementarity in their seed sequences with hcv rna genome   <cit> ,  two mirs reported as ifn-β-unresponsive mirs   <cit> ,  mir-122a that promotes hcv rna replication  <cit>  and  three mirs  modulated in innate immune response in monocytes/macrophages  <cit> . actually, the name of five of the above mirs  indicates mir families, not just individual mature mir species: thus, we analysed the level of each member of those families. overall, the expression profile of  <dig> mirs in 21- <dig> and ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cell lines was analysed . three mirs  showed an expression level below the detection limit of the assay , while five mirs were not differentially expressed in 21- <dig> cells . these eight mirs were not evaluated further.

n.d.: not detected, i.e. mirs showing an expression level below the detection limit of the assay 

the expression profile of the remaining  <dig> mirs revealed that they were modulated by ifn-β and/or hcv . in particular, concordant modulation  of  <dig> mirs  was observed in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells and in 21- <dig> replicon cells . this result indicates that hcv replication can induce a mir signature as ifn-β treatment. five mirs were modulated in 21- <dig> replicon cells only, as the level in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells was within the ±  <dig>  range set as background . two mirs were modulated in an opposite manner in ifn-β-treated huh- <dig> cells and in 21- <dig> replicon cells .

identification of common mirs modulated in different hcv replicon clones
to exclude that the mir expression profile was peculiar of the 21- <dig> clone, we analyzed the expression level of the  <dig> mirs in two other hcv replicon clones, 22- <dig> and 21- <dig>  the analysis revealed that  <dig> mirs showed concordant modulation in hcv clones as compared to huh- <dig> cells . in particular, mir-128a and mir-196a were down-regulated while mir-142-3p was up-regulated in all hcv clones.

identification of candidate mir target genes
to predict target genes, which may be co-regulated by the  <dig> concordant mirs, we used mirgator, an on-line interface that uses multiple target prediction programs. it has been shown that, to date, no program is able to predict all experimentally confirmed target genes. thus, to avoid as much as possible loss of putative target genes, relaxed options were used in mirgator . after removal of multiple mrnas corresponding to alternative mrna transcripts from a single gene, individual gene lists were merged and a final list of  <dig> total target genes was obtained, including genes controlled by at least one of the three mirs.

identification of genes common to mir target list and hcv microarray dataset
the observation of an inverse relationship between levels of mirs and levels of their target mrnas, due to mrna degradation of target genes, provides opportunities for validation of predicted targets using microarray profiling  <cit> . on this basis, to determine the candidate target genes directly regulated by mir-128a, mir-196a and mir-142-3p, we overlapped two datasets: the list of  <dig> total target genes predicted for the  <dig> mirs  and a microarray dataset including  <dig> genes  modulated in all hcv clones as compared to huh- <dig> cells  reported in our previous study  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> genes were common to both datasets indicating that target genes of the  <dig> mirs account for  <dig>  3%  of the differentially expressed genes detected in all three hcv clones. the list of  <dig> genes, including relevant informations, is provided in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  as levels of most mirs and their target mrnas exhibit an inverse expression relationship, we used gene expression profiling data to identify functional targets and validate target prediction, as previously reported  <cit> . by using this approach we found that  <dig> out of  <dig>  of the predicted target genes showed an expression level inversely correlated with that of the corresponding mir suggesting that, at least for these genes, a direct connection to mir regulation may be suggested. a complete list of the  <dig> genes  and the corresponding  <dig> mirs is provided in table  <dig>  the list includes symbol, name, probe id, fold-change  and p-value of the genes all obtained from microarray dataset. in addition, a functional description of the genes by panther protein classification system is enclosed  <cit> . overlapping the  <dig> genes with the dataset of genes resulting from microarray analysis of huh- <dig>  cells infected with hcv genotype 2a chimeric virus j6/jfh  <cit>  revealed  <dig> common genes  which showed the same direction of regulation  in both hcv clones and j6/jfh microarray datasets supporting the biological relevance of these genes in hcv replicative cycle. finally, to explore the involvement of the identified genes in hcv response to endogenous ifn, we also overlapped the list of  <dig> genes with the dataset of  <dig> human genes annotated in the interferome database  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  four genes  were identified as interferon regulated genes .

biological functions of the mir target genes
to classify genes into biological categories, we analyzed the gene ontology annotations of the  <dig> common genes with the panther protein classification system  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  panther system found several functional categories that were significantly enriched in this gene set compared to the entire ncbi reference list of human genome. we considered, as potentially interesting, only categories showing a p-value ≤  <dig> , as determined by the binomial statistic  <cit> . the  <dig> genes of the dataset were significantly classified by the panther system in  <dig> biological processes  and  <dig> molecular functions . compared with the ncbi reference list of human genome, this dataset showed a larger proportion of genes encoding proteins involved in chromatin binding and architecture, organelle organization, intracellular transport and neurotransmitter secretion . in addition, genes associated with catalytic activity, enzyme regulator activity and chromatin binding were represented much more abundantly in the dataset. interestingly, genes involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway were also present in the dataset . additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> reports the complete list of the genes that are responsible for statistical enrichment of each category shown in table 3

discussion
in the present study we analyzed the effect of hcv replication on the expression of selected mirs involved in the ifn-pathway. in particular, we identified  <dig> mirs that are equally modulated by hcv in three hcv replicon clones and by ifn treatment. moreover, we also identified  <dig> out of  <dig> predicted target genes, differentially expressed in hcv replicon cells, which are most likely functional targets of these  <dig> mirs: in fact they showed an inverse expression relationship with the level of the  <dig> mirs, as described for true targets. these genes could be implicated in regulation of the host response to hcv.

about one half predicted targets did not show the expected inverse expression relationship with mir level, but this result is not surprising. first, computational prediction by mirgator was based on predictions from the widely used programs miranda, targetscans and pictar . to date, these programs, as well as any other available prediction program, still have a very high false-positive rate, estimated to be up to 40%  <cit> : i.e. up to 40% genes predicted to be targeted by a mir are not, actually, true targets, and they will not show any inverse relationship. second, each mrna is usually targeted by multiple mirs and, in addition, each mrna has its own set of modulating mirs. whether or not a change in the level of a single mir can prevail on the effect of the other mirs simultaneously targeting the same mrna in physiological conditions is, at present, poorly understood. however, it is possible in some cases it will produce no effect and, thus, even a true target will not show the expected inverse relationship.

the recent discovery of the roles of mirs in many human diseases suggests that studies exploring the relationship between hcv and mirs/mrna may provide new insights into host cell response to hcv infection. importantly, this approach also gives the opportunity to identify viral mechanisms that control the antiviral defense. recently, it has been demonstrated that five ifn-β-modulated mirs  showed significant effect on hcv replication and at least two of them  are directly targeting the hcv genomic rna  <cit> . moreover, it seems that level of mir- <dig> is inversely correlated with the antiviral defense  <cit> .

our expression analysis revealed that mir-196a was down-regulated in all three hcv replicon clones. thus, at least for this component of the pathway, it seems that modulation of ifn-mirs may be altered by hcv in replicon cells. interestingly, this mir targets the hcv rna  <cit> , thus, down-regulation of mir-196a may indirectly influence viral replication also by up-regulation of specific target genes. accordingly,  <dig> genes, controlled by mir-196a, showed by microarray analysis an inverse expression relationship suggesting that they can be likely considered functional targets of mir-196a. moreover, gene ontology analysis of the  <dig> genes highlights that some of them are really involved in pathways such as, extracellular matrix constitution , oxidative stress  and cytoskeletal network , which are relevant for hcv rna replication  <cit> .

as for the ifn-β-regulated mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  our data indicate that their expression in different hcv replicon clones is either not concordant  or not detected . in particular, mir-122a was down-regulated in 21- <dig> and 21- <dig> clones but its level was not modified in clone 22- <dig>  while mir- <dig> was down-regulated in 21- <dig> clone and up-regulated in clone 22- <dig> and 21- <dig>  respectively . moreover, mir  <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were not detected in all clones examined supporting, at least for mir- <dig>  what found in human biopsies where mir- <dig> is totally absent  <cit> .

interestingly, we observed that two mirs, mir-142-3p and mir-128a, were up-regulated and down-regulated respectively by ifn-β treatment of huh- <dig> cells and in hcv replicon-expressing cells. although modulation of these  <dig> mirs by ifn-β has never been described before, it is consistently observed in all clones suggesting that it may be part of the endogenous ifn response to hcv. the ifn pathway is a highly regulated process and several controls has been evolved to activate and turn off this pathway. in this scenario, the temporal modulation of specific mirs seems to represent one of the control elements  <cit> . it is important to note that this process cannot properly occur in cells sustaining hcv replication. in this case a chronic up or down-regulation of ifn-mirs, likely induced by the virus, may negatively affect the control of the pathway finally improving the efficacy of the antiviral effectors. it would be interesting to investigate whether the experimental use of mir inhibitors  or mir mimics  could influence the control of the endogenous ifn system.

among the  <dig> predicted target genes showing an inverse expression relationship with the  <dig> mirs, four genes were identified as interferon regulated genes  according to the interferome database  <cit> . one of these genes  is a predicted target gene of mir-196a while the other three  are all targeted by mir-142-3p. importantly, in autoimmune diseases the high mobility group box  <dig>  protein was identified as a component of immune complex-containing dna or rna, which may act as endogenous ifn-β inducer  <cit> . down-regulation of hmgb <dig> gene  in all hcv replicon clones suggests that it might contribute to impair the activation of the ifn signaling. currently, the role of these four irgs in the ifn response to hcv replication is unknown. thus, unraveling their contribution to the regulation of the ifn response may reveal new mechanisms of viral persistence.

gene ontology annotations of the  <dig> common genes also revealed the presence of two genes, ube2e <dig> and atad <dig> targets of mir-128a and mir-142-3p respectively, which are involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. the contribution of this pathway to hcv subversion of the ifn response has never been investigated. this is a quite interesting issue as several viruses use the ubiquitin proteasome system to destabilize proteins, such as irf <dig> and stat proteins, that are important for transcription of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes  <cit> .

in attempt to validate our data, we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, targeted by the  <dig> mirs, were also modulated, in a concerted fashion, in hcv genotype 2a chimeric virus j6/jfh microarray datasets  <cit>  supporting the biological relevance of our results. in addition,  <dig> genes  selected from the hcv clones microarray dataset were found to be modulated in a same way in liver biopsies of patients showing non-cc il28b polymorphism  <cit> . this polymorphism is not a good predictor of response to ifn therapy and it is also associated with higher level of isg expression in the liver and propension to chronicity. so, it can be speculated that modulation of ifn signature as mediated by common mirs in replicon cells, can mirror de-regulation of the ifn signaling proposed for such patients.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we used the hcv replicon system to identify ifn-regulated mirs that are modulated by hcv rna replication. by a combined approach, based on real-time pcr, bioinformatic prediction and microarray analysis, we identified  <dig> ifn-β-regulated mirs and  <dig> genes, which are likely their functional targets, commonly modulated by hcv in three replicon clones. gene ontology classified the  <dig> genes into functional categories potentially implicated in the control of antiviral response by hcv infection. the future design of sirnas directed against some of these genes and the use of mirs and antimirs may provide an experimental background for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at the recovering of protective innate responses in hcv infections.
