BACKGROUND
in the human genome, there are over  <dig> genes coding for proteases with another  <dig> being protease inhibitors  <cit> . while the majority of protease genes belong to three different classes including serine, metallo- and cysteine proteases, a large portion  of human protease inhibitor genes belong solely to just one family: the serpin family.

the serpin family comprises hundreds of structurally homologous proteins that are present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms  <cit> . its members include inhibitors of serine proteases as well as non-inhibitory members with other biological functions  <cit> . in humans, a total of  <dig> serpin-coding genes were identified and grouped into  <dig> subfamilies designated serpina, serpinb, serpinc and so on till serpini subfamily  <cit> . each subfamily has its own specific chromosomal localization and well-conserved exon-intron arrangement. for example, nearly all members of the serpina subfamily are located at chromosome 14q <dig> and genes coding for the serpinb subfamily are clustered at two distinct chromosomal loci: 6p <dig> and 18q <dig>  <cit> . even for the last serpini subfamily, although consists of only two genes with one coding for a brain-associated protease inhibitor serpini <dig>  <cit>  and another for a pancreas-specific protease inhibitor serpini <dig>  <cit> , its two members are closely adjacent at chromosome 3q <dig> and share a perfectly conserved gene organization pattern  <cit> .

serpini <dig>  also known as neuroserpin or protease inhibitor  <dig>  is an axonally secreted serine protease inhibitor found in the nervous systems  <cit> . it functions as a selective inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator and is involved in a wide range of neuronal processes including synaptic plasticity  <cit> , neuronal migration  <cit>  and axogenesis  <cit> . genetic variations of serpini <dig> have been reported to render the enzyme conformation locked as an inactive folding intermediate  <cit> . these mutant proteins then undergo spontaneous polymerization within neurons and cause a severe progressive neurodegenerative encephalopathy named fenib   <cit> . in addition to the mutations at the dna level, the mrna expression of serpini <dig> was found to be down-regulated or lost in brain tumors  <cit> . these abnormalities, along with our latest findings that its adjacent gene serpini <dig> is also down-regulated in cancer  <cit> , prompted us to study the regulatory mechanism of serpini <dig> gene in both normal and cancerous brain tissues. interestingly, when the human genome sequence became available, it came to our attention that a gene termed pdcd <dig> was mapped to lie at less than  <dig> kb upstream of serpini <dig> in a divergent, head-to-head orientation.

pdcd <dig> was originally identified as tfar <dig>  for being up-regulated after the induction of apoptosis by serum withdrawal in tf- <dig> human premyeloid cells  <cit> . it was later grouped into a collection of genes thought to be involved in many apoptotic responses and thus renamed as pdcd <dig> . pdcd <dig> is highly conserved among different species, with over 99% amino-acid identity among human, dog, mouse and chicken. although its physiological role remains unclear, a recent study showed that inhibition of the nematode pdcd <dig> ortholog led to embryonic lethality in 40% of the embryos and a dumpy phenotype in postembryonic viable embryos  <cit> . furthermore, pdcd <dig> mutations were identified in families with cerebral cavernous malformation, indicating that this gene may play a role in the development of cerebral vascular morphogenesis  <cit> .

it is known that in prokaryotic and lower eukaryotic genomes, genes are often organized in a proximal pattern to facilitate gene co-expression and functional coupling. increasing evidence suggests that many genes in mammalian genomes also tend to be in close physical vicinity. recently, by conducting a genome-wide analysis of the human genome, trinklein and his colleagues identified a class of head-to-head gene pairs whose transcriptional start sites are separated by less than  <dig> kb  <cit> . since mammalian genomes are far more spacious than prokaryotic genomes, it seems unnecessary for two neighboring genes to be arranged in an adjacent head-to-head pattern unless they share a common regulatory system such as an intergenic bidirectional promoter. it is conceivable that bidirectional promoters of gene pairs may be able to co-regulate the genes in a more efficient manner. for example, for homologous gene pairs such as the pair of collagen type iv α <dig> and α <dig> genes  <cit>  and the pair of atp-binding cassette molecule abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> genes  <cit> , their bidirectional promoters were shown to co-regulate the two genes thus ensuring the co-expressivity of the gene products. for non-homologous genes like serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig>  however, the need for co-regulation is not as obvious. in addition, compared to all the other genes that are adjacently located to any of known serpin or pdcd genes, only the pair of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> genes were arranged in a head-to-head orientation and separated by an exceptionally short intergenic region. this close chromosomal proximity of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> and their divergent configuration are widely preserved in many species, implying that through the evolution there appears to have a need for serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> to be tightly linked together to maintain gene co-regulation or functional association.

in this study, we present evidence showing that while serpini <dig> is predominantly expressed in brain and down-regulated in brain tumors, pdcd <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in all normal tissues but its gene transcription becomes aberrant in different types of cancers. we have also identified a 175-bp regulatory fragment within the intergenic region of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> that functions as a bidirectional promoter. moreover, a critical fragment, from nt 176- <dig> outside the minimal promoter in this intergenic region, was found to possess a strong repressive activity for serpini <dig> and enhancing activity for pdcd <dig>  these cis-acting elements may exist to coordinate the expression and regulation of the two flanking genes. to the best of our knowledge, of all non-homologous genes that have been reported to be closely adjacent in the human genome, the intergenic region of the head-to-head pdcd10-serpini <dig> pair at 3q <dig> exhibits by far the most complex regulatory function that governs the expression of both genes not only through an asymmetric bidirectional promoter, but also through regulations with some other cis-acting elements.

RESULTS
expression patterns of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> in normal and cancerous tissues
in order to explore the distribution patterns of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig>  we performed northern blot analysis on a human multiple tissue expression array of poly a+ rnas. as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  while serpini <dig> expression was observed mainly in different parts of brain, hybridization of the same array with the pdcd <dig> probe revealed that it was ubiquitously expressed as a housekeeping gene in all tissues analyzed. moreover, as serpini <dig> and serpini <dig> were both reported to be down-regulated during tumor development  <cit> , it is rational to doubt that the expression of pdcd <dig>  which is located in between the two serpini genes at chromosome 3q <dig>  may also be altered in some tumors. results from the semi-quantitative rt-pcr indicate that while serpini <dig> expression was negatively correlated with tumor progression, the mrna level of pdcd <dig> was not much affected in brain tumor cells . furthermore, when we investigated the expression patterns of pdcd <dig> in other normal and cancerous tissues, we found that pdcd <dig> was up-regulated in various cancers including ovarian, stomach, lung, uterus and small intestine cancers .

determination of the distance of the intergenic region between human serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> genes
after analyzing the distribution of mrna transcripts for both serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> genes, we then attempted to pinpoint their precise transcriptional start sites in order to determine the length of their intergenic spacer. as revealed by the human genome reference sequence, serpini <dig>  and pdcd <dig>  were mapped in a head-to-head configuration at 3q <dig> and separated by less than  <dig> kb. by performing 5'-race on human brain rna, three transcriptional start sites for pdcd <dig> but only one transcriptional start site for serpini <dig> were identified. the closest transcriptional start site that we identified for pdcd <dig> and serpini <dig> were at  <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively upstream of the sites predicted by ncbi database, thus the shortest intergenic distance was recalculated to be  <dig> bp .

characterization of the asymmetric bidirectional promoter activity of the intergenic region
following the mapping of the transcriptional start sites, the 851-bp intergenic fragment constituting the putative regulatory region for both serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> genes was analyzed for its transcriptional activities by driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene. the human cell lines utilized for luciferase reporter assays include brain neuroglioma h <dig>  brain glioblastoma u- <dig> mg, ovarian adenocarcinoma ovtw-59- <dig>  lung adenocarcinoma cl1- <dig>  and cervical adenocarcinoma hela cancer cell lines. the rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma pc- <dig> cell line was also used for comparison as it had previously been chosen for the study of mouse serpini <dig> promoter  <cit> . the full-length 851-bp fragments in either direction toward serpini <dig> or pdcd <dig> were cloned into the reporter vector . by measuring the luciferase activity in various cell lysates after transient transfection, the 851-bp intergenic sequence was shown to be capable of driving the reporter gene expression in either direction . the promoter activities in the direction of pdcd <dig> in all cells tested were approximately  <dig> to 10-fold higher than those of serpini <dig>  moreover, the promoter activities toward the serpini <dig> direction were higher in brain tumor h <dig> and u- <dig> mg cells than those in other test cells, and they were nearly 3-fold higher than the positive control, the viral sv <dig> minimal promoter . these results indicate that the 851-bp intergenic region is able to function as a bidirectional promoter to control serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> expressions, and some regulatory elements within this region may asymmetrically regulate the transcription of both genes.

interspecies comparison of the 851-bp intergenic region and analysis of the putative cis-regulatory elements within this region
to understand whether the head-to-head configuration of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> is a unique feature only in human or if it is evolutionary conserved in other mammals, we aligned the homologous regions between these two genes among human, mouse and rat by the vector nti program . the results revealed that both the gene order and the compact head-to-head arrangement are conserved in different species , and that within the intergenic region there is an approximately 400-bp fragment near the vicinity of pdcd <dig> with the highest percent identity . based on the nucleotide sequence shown in fig. 4b, the 851-bp intergenic region has a gc content of 65%, which is much higher than the average of the entire human genome . while no tata-box is observed in this region, two caat boxes  are noted in the most conserved 400-bp fragment with a 100-bp distance from each other. in addition, within this highly conserved fragment, there are one neuron-specific ap- <dig>  one c-myc and one nfκb binding motives as well as several binding sites for the general transcription factor sp <dig> as predicted by matinspector  and tfsearch programs . the presence and conservation of these putative binding motives suggest that some of these transcription factors must possess an important evolutionary significance and some yet-unknown regulatory demands.

identification of the key regulatory region of the bidirectional promoter by deletion analysis
to identify the key regulatory dna sequences responsible for serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> gene expressions, we constructed a series of plasmids containing various intergenic promoter regions derived from the 851-bp sequence. by using the same reporter system addressed in fig.  <dig>  the luciferase activities of these constructs were assessed by transient transfection into h <dig> cells. due to the neuron-specific expression of the serpini <dig> gene, the promoter activity of serpini <dig> in neuron cells is higher than those in cells from other tissues. thus, h <dig> cells were used as a vehicle for studying the regulatory mechanism of serpini <dig> promoter. as shown in fig.  <dig>  removal of the sequence from nt  <dig> to  <dig> completely abolished luciferase activity compared to the full-length 851-bp fragment in the serpini <dig> direction, suggesting that this 175-bp fragment is important for the control of serpini <dig> gene expression. this fragment alone was also capable of driving the reporter gene expression in the pdcd <dig> direction. further splitting of this bidirectional promoter region into two parts, i.e. the sequence from nt  <dig> to  <dig> or from nt  <dig> to  <dig>  resulted in a dramatic loss of luciferase activity. surprisingly, deletion of the fragment of nt  <dig> to  <dig> increased more than 3-fold of the luciferase activity relative to that of the 851-bp fragment in the serpini <dig> direction but only kept a ~40% remaining of the luciferase activity in the pdcd <dig> direction . these results strongly indicate that within the fragment of nt 176- <dig> there likely exist a repressive element that can regulate serpini <dig> expression and an enhancer that can modulate pdcd <dig> expression. based on these findings, we conclude that a 175-bp minimal promoter region from nt  <dig> to  <dig> near the vicinity of pdcd <dig> and a regulatory region outside the 175-bp fragment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> may coordinately regulate the gene transcriptions of serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig> 

possible locations of the repressive element for serpini <dig> and the enhancer for pdcd10
from the experiment described in fig.  <dig>  there seems to exist a regulatory fragment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> which possesses no promoter activity but appears to contain a repressive element for serpini <dig> and an enhancer for pdcd <dig>  thus, we cloned this fragment in two opposite directions into the upstream of the sv <dig> promoter in a pgl3-promoter vector, and examined their effects on the sv <dig> promoter. as expected, the fragment of nt 176- <dig> in the pdcd <dig> direction was able to increase the sv <dig> promoter activity for approximately  <dig> -fold . this observation confirmed the existence of an enhancer for pdcd <dig> as seen in fig.  <dig>  however, there was no increase of the sv <dig> promoter activity in the direction of serpini <dig>  this phenomenon was possibly a compromising effect resulted from the coordination between the enhancer and the repressive element within the regulatory region; the extent of such effect may also vary for using different heterologous promoters.

to further identify the enhancer responsible for pdcd <dig>  three intergenic fragments including 1) the nt 176- <dig> fragment, 2) the nt 474- <dig> fragment, and 3) the nt 711- <dig> fragment toward the pdcd <dig> direction were individually cloned into the upstream of the sv <dig> promoter and assayed for their promoter activity in h <dig> cells. the results showed that only the nt 473- <dig> fragment was able to increase the sv <dig> promoter activity by  <dig> to 10-fold . the same fragment toward the serpini <dig> direction had no such effect on the sv <dig> promoter activity . hence, there is an orientation-dependent enhancer located in the fragment of nt 176- <dig> and acting on the transcription of pdcd <dig>  as for the search of the repressive element for serpini <dig>  the same fragments but in opposite direction were individually cloned into a modified pgl3-promoter vector containing a cmv promoter, a stronger promoter than the sv <dig> and better for repressive activity studies. the assay results demonstrated that only the fragment from nt 176- <dig> toward the serpini <dig> direction possessed a repressive ability which inhibited ~70% of the cmv promoter activity . nonetheless, the same fragment but in the opposite orientation  could only enhance the cmv promoter activity for approximately 2-fold . these findings signify that a critical fragment from nt 176- <dig> outside the minimal promoter possesses a strong repressive activity for serpini <dig> and enhancing activity for pdcd <dig> 

discussion
it has long been suggested that the human serpin genes are evolved from the same ancestor through intra- and interchromosomal duplications to develop into different clusters  <cit> . interestingly, when the human genome sequence was unveiled a few years ago, several non-homologous genes were found to be mapped into the serpin gene clusters. one of these genes, pdcd <dig>  not only forms a head-to-head organization with serpini <dig> at chromosome 3q <dig> but also shares a tiny promoter with it. the organization of this divergent gene pair is well preserved in many species throughout the evolution, indicating that pdcd <dig> and serpini <dig> need to be tightly together to maintain the gene co-regulation or their functional association. further sequence analysis on the intergenic region revealed a 400-bp fragment near the vicinity of pdcd <dig> is highly similar among human, mouse and rat, a result strongly indicating that the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of these two genes are evolutionary conserved among different species. indeed, by performing a series of luciferase assays, a 175-bp fragment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> in the vicinity of pdcd <dig> was determined to function as a minimal promoter of both genes . the same 175-bp minimal promoter was also observed  when we utilized the human intergenic fragment to perform the promoter analysis in rat adrenal gland pc <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, we detected the existence of an important regulatory fragment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> in the vicinity of pdcd <dig> that possesses a repressive activity for serpini <dig> . these findings are different from a previous study on mouse serpini <dig>  <cit>  claiming that a 200-bp segment near the transcription initiation site of serpini <dig> was responsible for promoter activity. there are at least two possible reasons for the discrepancy observed in human and mouse serpini <dig> promoter. first, the constructs used for promoter analysis of mouse serpini <dig> were all derived from 5' deletions of the full-length promoter region. these constructs might have contained the repressive element and/or lost the minimal promoter, and thus have very low promoter activities which could not be differentiated from each other. secondly, different cell lines chosen might result in different conclusions; particularly the rat adrenal gland cell line pc <dig> has very low expression of serpini <dig> 

trinklein and colleagues have pointed out that divergently transcribed gene pairs whose transcriptional start sites are separated by less than  <dig> kb represent more than 10% of genes in the whole human genome  <cit> . such a high proportion indicates that there is a biological importance for those adjacent gene pairs even through a long evolution. two feasible explanations for the existence of bidirectional promoters in the mammalian genome were recently given by zhang and colleagues  <cit> . the first explanation is that they are the ancestral sequences survived in evolution. a bidirectional promoter, like the one for pdcd <dig> and serpini <dig>  with the characteristics of tata-less, gc-rich and multiple sp <dig> sites was thought to be the preserved ancestral sequences. the second explanation is that the genes sharing the bidirectional promoter are functionally related. from the sequence alignment data, we observed that this highly conserved promoter sequence is maintained throughout the evolution. besides, there are evidences indicating that pdcd <dig> and serpini <dig> are both related to brain diseases. therefore, we suggest that the compact adjacent arrangement for pdcd <dig> and serpini <dig> might be due to the possibility that they are involved in the same biological pathway.

apart from the pdcd10-serpini <dig> gene pair at chromosome 3q <dig>  there was another human head-to-head gene pair found to be associated with brain diseases  <cit> . this gene pair, consisting of the parkinsonism-related parkin gene  and parkin co-regulated gene  at chromosome 6q <dig> - <dig>  has many features in common with the pdcd10-serpini <dig> pair. like serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig>  park <dig> and pacrg are also non-homologous. park <dig>  like serpini <dig>  has its tissue specificity and is mainly expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle and kidney. pacrg is expressed in all tissues like pdcd <dig>  the bidirectional promoter of pacrg-park <dig> is also tata-less, gc-rich, and with multiple sp <dig> binding sites  <cit> . furthermore, the genetic mutations of serpini <dig> and park <dig> are able to accelerate the formation of cellular inclusion bodies and to cause the dementia symptom  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that brain, being the most sophisticated organ which controls almost all responses of the whole body, may use bidirectional promoters to achieve gene expressions more efficiently, especially in the pathogenesis of its diseases.

gene expression and tissue specificity are often regulated by transcriptional activators or repressors  <cit> . in the case of the pdcd10-serpini <dig> gene pair, it is apparent that these two genes are not co-expressed genes . this phenomenon can be best explained by the existence of a critical fragment, from nt  <dig> to  <dig> of the intergenic sequence, which contains an enhancer and a repressive element to coordinately regulate the transcriptions of both genes . the intergenic enhancer is orientation-dependent exerting its effect on the promoter of pdcd <dig> in the native context . it also works in an orientation-dependent manner with heterologous promoters . previously, a similar orientation-dependent intergenic enhancer had been reported in a mouse gene pair: the divergent cryab  and hspb <dig>  pair  <cit> . however, this is the first time that such an enhancer is identified in the human genome. moreover, the neuron-specificity of serpini <dig> and its down-regulation in brain tumorigenesis may be accounted for by a repressive element located in the same critical regulatory fragment . together these results suggest that the fine coordination between the orientation-dependent cis-control elements may play an important role in the asymmetrical expressions of pdcd <dig> and serpini <dig> in different tissues. in addition to the cis-control elements, the possible involvement of certain trans-acting factors in this bidirectional promoter region need to be further elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present evidence that two non-homologous brain diseases-related genes, serpini <dig> and pdcd <dig>  are tightly linked in a divergent configuration by a bidirectional promoter in an evolutionarily conserved fashion. within their tiny intergenic region, a segment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> near the vicinity of pdcd <dig> was identified to function as a minimal promoter to efficiently drive the expressions of the two flanking genes. a critical regulatory fragment from nt  <dig> to  <dig> was further determined to contain a repressive element for serpini <dig> and an enhancer for pdcd <dig> that coordinately regulate the transcriptions of both genes. for all the non-homologous genes that have been described to be closely adjacent in the human genome, the intergenic region of the head-to-head pdcd10-serpini <dig> gene pair at 3q <dig> exhibits an interesting and informative example of a complex regulatory system that governs the expression of both genes not only through an asymmetric bidirectional promoter, but also through fine-tuned regulations with some cis-acting elements.
