BACKGROUND
the lung arises from a small diverticulum in the anterior foregut endoderm at the laryngotracheal groove. the respiratory epithelium then invades the surrounding mesenchyme, followed by the formation of respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts  <cit> . human lung morphogenesis takes place at approximately four weeks of gestation and continues into postnatal life up to early adulthood. the events of growth and development of human lung have traditionally been divided into five stages according to changes in the structure of the airway tubes and morphological modifications of epithelial cells: embryonic stage , pseudoglandular stage , canalicular stage , saccular stage  and alveolar stage   <cit> .

the process of lung development relies on the precise coordination of epithelial -mesenchymal interactions controlled by a number of complex signaling cascades, including bone-morphogenic proteins , fibroblast growth factors , sonic hedgehog  and the wingless-type mmtv integration site family   <cit> , which is known to regulate these interactions by the means of autocrine and paracrine processes  <cit> . at least three wnt signaling pathways are involved in the signal transduction process, of which the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is the best characterized  <cit> . in the unstimulated canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway, β-catenin is bound to the scaffold proteins axin and adenomatosis polyposis coli , constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase i and glycogen synthase kinase  and subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm. however, binding of the wnt ligands to two distinct membrane receptors, the frizzled  and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins   <dig> and  <dig>  leads to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic region of lpr <dig> by gsk-3β and casein kinase-γ, which results in the recruitment of the cytosolic proteins known as dishevelled  1– <dig> and axin. subsequently, β-catenin is neither phosphorylated nor degraded, but accumulates in the cytoplasm, where it translocates into the nucleus and regulates expression of target genes such as cyclin d1mmp <dig> and c-myc through interactions with t cell-specific transcription factor  and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor   <cit> .

many studies have used mouse genetic approaches to show that canonical wnt signaling plays an important role in the development of mammalian lung. for instance, the wnt <dig> knockout mouse is associated with perinatal lethality resulting from lung hypoplasia, which is characterized by dilated endothelial vasculature, decreased cell proliferation and downregulation of genes crucial for normal lung development  <cit> . mouse wnt <dig> and wnt2b double mutants exhibit under-development of the lung including the absence of tracheal budding at e <dig>   and lack of certain epithelial cell markers   <cit> . wnt7b knockout mice die shortly after birth due to severe lung hypoplasia with defects in branching morphogenesis and cell proliferation, as well as defects in lung epithelial differentiation. smooth muscle α-actin expression is also abnormal in wnt7b mutants  <cit> . similarly, inactivation of β-catenin in lung epithelium after lung budding causes aberrant epithelial branching and proximal-distal patterning  <cit> . inactivation of β-catenin in lung mesenchyme results in decreased mesenchymal growth and defective endothelial differentiation  <cit> . moreover, the deletion of β-catenin during trachea/lung morphogenesis results in shortening of the trachea and reduced lung size  <cit> .

it has also been reported that canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling ligands   <cit> , receptors   <cit> , transducers   <cit> , as well as transcription factors   <cit>  exhibit highly cell-specific expression patterns in the developing murine lung. however, tissue-specific expression of certain components involved in the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway during human lung development has not yet been investigated. this study demonstrated that canonical wnt signaling components are expressed in specific spatio-temporal patterns in the developing human lung by using real-time qrt-pcr analysis and in situ hybridization. analysis of in vitro activity stimulated by chir  <dig> further revealed that the wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade is crucial for early human lung patterning during morphogenesis.

RESULTS
expression of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling component mrna in the developing human lung
human lung development can be divided into five stages with distinct structures visible at each stage. the most significant growth phase occurs in the pseudoglandular stage , followed by the canalicular stage . therefore, as we previously described  <cit> , the current study was focused on events at 7 w, 12 w, 17 w and 21 w to analyze patterns of gene expression in the developing human lung.

quantification of the mrna expression of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components in human lung tissues at 7 w, 12 w, 17 w and 21 w was performed using real-time qrt-pcr. investigation of the transcription levels of the canonical wnt ligands, wnt <dig> and wnt7b, revealed that wnt <dig> expression decreased significantly from 7 w to 12 w with a subsequent gradual increase at 17 w and a further dramatic decrease at 21 w . in contrast, wnt7b transcripts were markedly upregulated from 7 w to 12 w, while a decreasing trend in wnt7b mrna expression was observed from 12 w to 21 w .

expression of canonical wnt receptors  and co-receptors  was also detected in human embryonic lung tissues. an obvious increase in fzd <dig>  lrp <dig> and lrp <dig> mrna levels was detected from 7 w to 17 w, whereas no changes in fzd <dig> transcripts were observed during this period. interestingly, mrna levels of four canonical wnt receptor genes  substantially decreased from the 17 w to 21 w .

expression of canonical wnt signal transducers  was also determined by qrt-pcr in the developing human lung. with exception of dvl <dig> and axin <dig>  the mrna levels of dvl <dig>  gsk-3β, β-catenin and apc were significantly downregulated from 7 w to 12 w, while dvl <dig> and axin <dig> expression markedly increased during this period . subsequently, the expression of canonical wnt transducers  increased at 17 w, but decreased at 21 w .

finally, the mrna expression levels of canonical wnt signaling transcription factors  were examined in human lung at 7 w, 12 w, 17 w and 21 w. tcf <dig> and lef <dig> presented a similar expression pattern in the developing human lung, with gradually decreasing expression levels from 7 w to 12 w followed by an obvious increase at 17 w and a further significant decrease at 21 w . analysis of expression of the wnt signaling antagonist sostdc <dig> in embryonic human lung tissues revealed that sostdc <dig> transcripts were upregulated from 7 w to 12 w, steadily increased to a high level at 17 w and subsequently declined at 21 w .

in combination, these real-time qrt-pcr data demonstrated that most canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components expressed in the developing human lung and, with the exception of wnt7b and fzd <dig>  reached high levels at 17 w, subsequently decreasing at 21 w.

expression pattern of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components in the developing human lung
in situ hybridization was performed to confirm the expression patterns of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components during human lung development at 7 w, 12 w, 17 w and 21 w. initial h&e staining of histological sections showed that, during the period from 7 w to 21 w , the airway and vascular networks continuously branched and the airway epithelial cells differentiated progressively from tall columnar cells, to short columnar cells and then to cuboidal cells . these data indicate normal lung morphogenesis and are consistent with our previous reports  <cit> .

the mrna expression patterns of canonical wnt ligands  were then examined in the developing human lung by in situ hybridization. wnt <dig> expression was obviously restricted to epithelial cells of the fetal lung at 7 w and 17 w but was dramatically downregulated at 12 w and 21 w . wnt7b transcripts were clearly detected in the respiratory airways from 7 w to 17 w  but were barely detectable at 21 w .

expression of canonical wnt signaling receptors in the developing human lung
in situ hybridization was also used to determine the expression patterns of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling receptors  and co-receptors  in the developing human lung. fzd <dig>  fzd <dig>  lrp <dig> and lrp <dig>  which exhibited very similar expression patterns, were initially restricted to the conducting airways and the peripheral epithelium from 7 w to 17 w . expression was subsequently maintained at a relatively low level in the peripheral epithelium at 21 w .

expression of canonical wnt signaling transducers in the developing human lung
the mrna expression pattern of canonical wnt/β-catenin signal transducers dvl <dig>  dvl <dig>  gsk-3β, β-catenin, apc and axin <dig> was analyzed in fetal human lung by in situ hybridization. expression of dvl <dig>  gsk-3β and apc was distinctively confined to the peripheral epithelium from the pseudoglandular to the canalicular stage , with the exception of gsk-3β transcripts, which were detected at lower levels in both the respiratory epithelium and the pulmonary mesenchyme at 7 w . in contrast, three other transducers, dvl <dig>  β-catenin and axin <dig>  were expressed strongly in the peripheral epithelium and weakly throughout the mesenchyme surrounding the terminal buds from the pseudoglandular to the canalicular stage .

the strength of the signals attained by in situ hybridization showed that dvl <dig>  dvl <dig> and axin <dig> expression remained relatively high from 7 w to 17 w  and was obviously downregulated at 21 w . interestingly, the signals of gsk-3β, β-catenin and apc transcripts appeared strong at 7 w and 17 w , but were dramatically reduced and almost undetectable at 12 w and 21 w .

expression of canonical wnt signaling transcription factors in the developing human lung
the distribution of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling transcription factors  was examined during human lung development by in situ hybridization. tcf <dig> was highly expressed in the peripheral epithelium and in small amounts in the surrounding mesenchymal cells during the pseudoglandular stage , while lef <dig> was predominantly expressed in the respiratory epithelium during this period . subsequently, tcf <dig> and lef <dig> expression was downregulated significantly in both the peripheral epithelium and the mesenchyme at the canalicular stage . furthermore, expression of wnt signaling inhibitor or antagonist sostdc <dig> was also detected by in situ hybridization. positive sostdc <dig> staining was predominantly localized in the peripheral epithelium during the pseudoglandular stage  and persisted into the canalicular stage . negative controls for in situ hybridization in the developing human lung were shown in figure 5m–p.

all the in situ hybridization data obtained in this study showed that expression of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components was mainly localized in the bronchial and alveolar epithelium in embryonic human lung tissues, although some of the components were found to be expressed at low levels in the surrounding mesenchyme. moreover, the expression patterns of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components detected by in situ hybridization were found to be in accordance with those detected by qrt-pcr.

activity of canonical wnt/β-catenin signals in the developing human lung
to further assess canonical wnt signaling activities in the developing human lung, chir  <dig> was used to activate wnt/β-catenin signaling cascades  <cit>  through in vitro exposure of human lung explants  to  <dig>   <dig> and 10 μm chir  <dig> for 72 h. as presented in figure 6a and b, western blot analysis showed β-catenin expression in 15 w human lung explants decreased significantly from newly isolated to in vitro cultured for 72 h . however, β-catenin expression nearly increased back to newly isolated levels in human lung explants at 15 w treated with 5 μm chir  <dig> for 72 h, but decreased again after treatment of 10 μm chir  <dig>  meanwhile, qrt-pcr analyses showed increased expression of transcription factors  and target genes  in human lung explants  exposed to 5 μm chir  <dig> compared with tissues exposed to 0 μm chir  <dig>  the levels of which were also higher than in the 10 μm chir  <dig> groups .

we then performed histological analysis. the human lung explants  cultured in vitro for 72 h showed enlarged lung tubes and differentiation of the airway epithelial cells around the tubes from short columnar to cuboidal morphology . however, parallel explant tissues treated with 5 μm chir  <dig> for 72 h differentiated back to short columnar cells , with slighter changes between cuboidal and short columnar shape observed in the groups exposed to 5 μm chir  <dig> . in contrast, no obvious differences were observed in the amount of lung tubes formed in the control and chir  <dig> treated explant tissues.

discussion
crucial roles of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components in the developing human lung
this study described the mrna expression of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components at the tissue level during human lung development at 7 w, 12 w, 17 w and 21 w. most of the canonical wnt signaling components were detected at 7 w and increased to high levels at 17 w followed by a decrease at 21 w using quantitative real-time qrt-pcr. expression of all essential components was demonstrated in the fetal lung and shown to be predominantly localized to the respiratory and peripheral epithelium by in situ hybridization.

human lung development can be divided into five stages  <cit> . at around 4 weeks of gestation, the lung develops as an outgrowth from the ventral wall of the foregut, with trachea subsequently branching into the lobar and segmental bronchi. at approximately 7 weeks of gestation, the airways further branched and epithelial cells differentiated progressively into tall pseudostratified columnar epithelium. by 12 weeks, many small tubular structures surrounded by short columnar cells were distributed throughout the human lung sections. from 17 weeks of gestation, the short columnar epithelium was replaced progressively by cuboidal cells in a distal to proximal direction. at 21 weeks of gestation, the differentiation of pneumocytes and some extent of alveolization could be observed in human lung  <cit> . all in all, in human lung, 70 % of the total airways generated at birth are formed by 14 w  <cit>  and all of the conducting airways and terminal bronchioles are formed by the end of 17 w  <cit> . therefore, it was speculated that most of the canonical wnt signaling components were already present in the lung buds, but their functions may be predominantly involved in branching and division of conduction airway or terminal bronchioles during the pseudoglandular stage . this hypothesis is also supported by previous reports that the wnt signaling system is not necessary for the establishment of the primary branching pattern of the lung but is required for appropriate branching morphogenesis  <cit> .

analysis of gene expression patterns indicated that all of the canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components were mainly expressed in the peripheral epithelium, although the canonical wnt signal transducers and transcription factors were also slightly scattered into the surrounding mesenchyme in the developing human lung. correct patterning of lung tissues depends on epithelial-mesenchymal cell interactions  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the canonical wnt signals are primarily transduced into the epithelial cells through wnt receptors and co-receptors and then activated by downstream signal transducers and transcription factors both in the peripheral epithelium and mesenchymal cells through epithelial-mesenchymal cell interactions. it is also possible that the fast and progressive differentiation of tubular structures and epithelial cells during human lung development results in the slighter and weaker strength of signals in the mesenchyme attained by in situ hybridization, consistent with our previous observations  <cit> .

chir  <dig> is one of a new class of highly selective gsk- <dig> inhibitors that effectively inhibit gsk- <dig> activity under many conditions in isolated cells and tissues  <cit> . in this study, chir <dig> was used to activate canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling components in the developing human lung. increased expression of β-catenin and wnt signal transcription factors  and target genes  was observed in human lung tissues  after exposure to chir  <dig>  königshoff et al. also demonstrated increased mrna levels of the wnt target gene cycd <dig> in response to wnt signal activation by wnt3a in human lung tissues in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, additional activities of wnt signaling in human lung tissues  stimulated by chir  <dig> did not accelerate the branching and division of airway conduction, but activated the airway epithelial cells retarding back from cuboidal to short columnar cells, which was contrary to the normal lung morphogenesis that the airway epithelial cells differentiated progressively from tall columnar cells, to short columnar cells and then to cuboidal cells  <cit> .

wnt/β-catenin signaling is one of the critical developmental pathways that are considered important for both self-renewal and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells  <cit> . during lung epithelial regeneration, the wnt signaling controls the balance between stem/progenitor expansion and epithelial differentiation. forced activation of canonical wnt signaling leads to increased bronchioalveolar stem cell  expression and decreased epithelial differentiation  <cit> . wnt signaling has also been implicated in specifying early lung endoderm progenitors. activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling can reprogram posterior endoderm to a lung progenitor fate  <cit> . moreover, β-catenin maintained airway epithelial progenitor cells in relatively undifferentiated state, and stabilization of β-catenin in clara cell blocked postnatal secretory cell maturation and secretory-to-ciliated cell differentiation  <cit> . therefore, in our studies, it is possible that these additional wnt signaling activities reprogram the airway epithelial cells in human embryonic lung to the early epithelial cells, which indicated the roles of wnt signaling pathway not only in appropriate lung branching morphogenesis, but also in lung cell fate decisions and differentiation. furthermore, a wnt signaling feedback mechanism may exist in human lung tissues for expression of β-catenin, wnt signaling transcription factors and target genes, and differentiation of airway epithelial cells all decreased in the presence of relatively high chir  <dig> concentrations.

comparison of canonical wnt/β-catenin signaling expression patterns in embryonic mouse and human lung
wnt signaling is known to regulate murine lung specification and development by appropriate spatial and temporal mechanisms  <cit> . several wnt ligands, receptors and components of the canonical pathway are widely expressed in the developing murine lung. for instance, wnt <dig> is highly expressed in the developing lung mesenchyme  <cit> , while wnt7b is predominantly localized in distal and proximal bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> . in addition, a wide range of wnt receptors including fzd <dig>  fzd <dig>  lrp <dig>  and lrp <dig> are expressed in tissue-specific patterns during murine lung development. fzd <dig> and fzd <dig> are expressed primarily in the developing lung mesenchyme, whereas lrp <dig> and lrp <dig> are expressed in the airway epithelium of lung tissues  <cit> . in this study, expression of wnt2wnt7bfzd4fzd7lrp <dig> and lrp <dig> in the developing human lung was distinctly restricted to the alveolar and bronchial epithelium. this pattern of expression differs from that found in mouse lung.

in the stimulated canonical pathway, binding of the wnt ligands to the fzd receptors complex with lrp, leading to increased levels of cytosolic β-catenin and resulting in the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus and regulation of target gene expression through interaction with the transcription factors, tcf and lef  <cit> . in the mouse, three dvl genes  are widely, but not specifically, expressed in embryonic tissues  <cit> . dvl <dig> and dvl <dig> are expressed at relatively high and moderate levels respectively in lung tissues, although dvl <dig> expression has not been determined  <cit> . β-catenin is localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the epithelium and adjacent mesenchyme in the developing mouse lung  <cit> . however, gsk-3β, apc and axin <dig> exhibit moderate or weak expression levels, but are not specified in e <dig>  mouse lung tissues  <cit> . in this study, other wnt signal transducers  were shown to be present not only in the peripheral epithelium, but also at low levels in the sub-adjacent mesenchyme during human lung development, whereas dvl <dig> and apc were localized in the lung epithelium only.

similar to the expression pattern of β-catenin, tcf and lef <dig> were expressed in both adjacent mesenchyme and the proximal epithelium of the embryonic mouse lung  <cit> . however, in the developing human lung it was observed that lef <dig> was restricted to the alveolar and bronchial epithelium, while tcf <dig> was expressed both in the epithelium and the mesenchyme. taken together, these results suggest that, although the basic mechanism governing establishment of functional and structural diversity within the respiratory system is likely to be conserved among mammals  <cit> , the canonical wnt signaling pathway components exhibit some different expression patterns in developing human and mouse lungs.

the clinical significance of the canonical wnt signaling pathway in human lung development
in addition to its role in lung development and morphogenesis, the canonical wnt signaling pathway is also linked to the pathogenesis of human lung diseases, such as lung cancer, lung fibrosis, lung inflammation, pulmonary arterial hypertension  and bronchopulmonary dysplasia   <cit> . the role of wnt signaling in various types of cancer is well established. for example, differential expression of several wnt components including wnt <dig>  wnt <dig>  wnt7a, dvl <dig>  β-catenin and apc, have been reported in normal lung tissues and lung cancers, particularly in nsclc   <cit> . studies in animal models, as well as in human disease, have identified several components of the canonical wnt signaling pathway, including wnt <dig>  fzd <dig>  lrp <dig>  β-catenin and gsk-3β which are overexpressed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis   <cit> . in contrast, the role of wnt signaling in lung inflammation is largely unexplored, although the canonical pathway activator wnt- <dig> is implicated in lung inflammation by being linked to stimulation of pro-mmp <dig> transcription  <cit> . pah characterized by cellular and structural changes in pulmonary arteries, has also been shown to be associated with mutations in bmprii via activation of the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . furthermore, gene expression analysis of pulmonary arterial resistance vessels demonstrated differential regulation of canonical and non-canonical wnt genes in pah  <cit> . bpd is a chronic lung disease in infants characterized by lung injury resulting from mechanical ventilation and oxygen exposure or from defects in lung development. a role for wnt signaling in bpd is suggested by activation of the pathway during hyperoxia-induced neonatal rat lung injury  <cit> . dysregulation of the canonical wnt signaling pathway leads to lung disease and therefore, this investigation of the canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway in humans provides both further elucidation of the pathogenesis of wnt-related human lung disease and identification of potential therapeutic targets. furthermore, given the ability of canonical wnt signaling to regulate stem cell/progenitor expansion and regeneration in the lung, the future to use agonists of this pathway to increase lung injury repair and regeneration may be possible.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to describe the expression patterns of the canonical wnt signaling components in the developing human lung. real-time qrt-pcr data demonstrated most of components were detected at 7 w and increased to high levels at 17 w followed by a decrease at 21 w. all the in situ hybridization data showed that expression of canonical wnt signaling components was mainly localized in the bronchial and alveolar epithelium in embryonic human lung tissues, although some of the components were expressed at low levels in the surrounding mesenchyme. the canonical wnt signaling activity was stimulated by in vitro exposure of human lung tissues into chir  <dig>  our data of the specific spatio-temporal patterns and in vitro activity of canonical wnt signaling in the developing human lung revealed that the wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade is crucial for early human lung patterning during morphogenesis.
