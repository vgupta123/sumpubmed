BACKGROUND
a substantial amount of the genetic variation in bacteria is carried in plasmids  <cit> . plasmids are part of the flexible genome, which is defined by the high plasticity and modularity of its genetic elements and high rates of gene acquisition and loss  <cit> . they are typically composed of conserved backbone modules coding for replication, maintenance and transfer functions as well as variable accessory modules. the capture of genetic modules by plasmid backbones can increase phenotypic diversity and thereby increase the chances of responding to uncertain environmental changes or of exploiting an opportunity for transient niche expansion  <cit> . plasmids are classified according to incompatibility  groups that are based on the inability of plasmids with the same replication or segregation mechanisms to co-exist in the same cell  <cit> . inca/c plasmids have attracted the attention of the research community due to their ability to acquire antimicrobial resistance traits and to mobilize them across geographical and taxonomical borders  <cit> . recent comparative studies have addressed the evolutionary relationships among the inca/c plasmids from salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia pestis, yersinia ruckeri, vibrio cholera, photobacterium damselae and aeromonas salmonicida  <cit> . over the last decade, increasing attention has been focused on plasmids that harbour the antimicrobial resistance gene blacmy- <dig>  which encodes an ampc-type beta-lactamase that hydrolyzes third-generation cephalosporins  <cit> . in salmonella enterica, blacmy- <dig> is frequently carried by inca/c or inci <dig> plasmids  <cit> .

in a previous study, we examined the genetic variation of a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium population isolated from human and food-animal sources from four geographic regions in mexico  <cit> . multilocus sequence typing  and xbai macro-restriction showed two predominant genotypes, st <dig> and st <dig>  st <dig> has been reported worldwide and is the most abundant typhimurium genotype in the mlst database  <cit> , while st <dig> has only been reported in mexico. clonal complex analysis supported st <dig> as the founder genotype, while st <dig> was determined to be a derived genotype replacing st <dig>  we found a non-random distribution of virulence and antimicrobial resistance accessory genes across chromosomal backgrounds, and several associations among core and accessory genetic markers were detected. first, the salmonella virulence plasmid  was found in st <dig> strains, but not in st <dig> strains. second, the plasmid-borne blacmy- <dig> gene was found only in st <dig> strains. third, the most abundant integron, the integron profile one , was found only in st <dig> strains. fourth, the salmonella genomic island  was found in a subgroup of st <dig> strains carrying pstv  <cit> . the general picture obtained from that study was a population composed of two main genotypes marked by the presence of different accessory genes.

the emergence of the multi-drug resistant  st <dig> genotype associated with resistance to expanded spectrum cephalosporins is a public health threat in mexico where this clone has rapidly disseminated throughout certain regions, causing severe and fatal infections in infants  <cit> . the objective of the current study was to examine the association between the recently emerged genotype mdr st <dig> and blacmy- <dig> plasmids. st <dig> isolates were analyzed by plasmid profiling, pcr replicon typing  <cit> , plasmid psti restriction profiles  <cit> , southern hybridization, plasmid pcr screening and sequencing of regions scattered throughout the inca/c plasmids  <cit> , and by their conjugation abilities. we found two divergent types of inca/c plasmids: one composed of plasmids possessing or lacking the blacmy- <dig> region and the other lacking blacmy- <dig>  we discuss our results in the context of epidemiological findings in mexico, and we present evolutionary hypotheses regarding the origin of the two genetic types of inca/c plasmids.

RESULTS
plasmid profiling, pcr replicon typing and plasmid size
the plasmid profiles of the  <dig> st <dig> isolates showed that these strains carried a large number of plasmids  in a wide range of sizes  .

pcr replicon typing was performed for incompatibility groups that had been reported to be associated with either pstv or blacmy- <dig>  such as incfii, incfib, inca/c, inchi <dig> and inci <dig>  <cit> . all  <dig> isolates that carried blacmy- <dig> were positive for the inca/c group and negative for the other inc groups. unexpectedly, among the  <dig> st <dig> isolates lacking blacmy- <dig>   <dig> were positive for the inca/c group. additionally, the inchi <dig> and inci <dig> groups were detected in three and two isolates, respectively. thirteen blacmy-2-negative and inca/c-positive isolates were selected to represent different sources, states and years of isolation for further analysis, and compared them with the blacmy-2-positive isolates .

alkaline lysis profiles and pfge s1-digestion gels of plasmids from strains in our collection were hybridized with blacmy- <dig> and repa/c probes; all of the cmy+ isolates yielded signals in the same plasmids, confirming that blacmy- <dig> is carried in large inca/c plasmids . in contrast, only the repa/c probe hybridized in the cmy- isolates, again targeting large plasmids  . consistent with their low copy number  <cit> , the inca/c plasmids yielded faint bands in the ethidium bromide-stained gels, especially those larger than  <dig> kb , but they were unambiguously detected in the hybridization experiments.

characterization of inca/c plasmids based on the antibiotic resistance phenotype
to isolate and characterize the inca/c plasmids present in the mexican st <dig> genotype, e. coli top <dig> or dh5α transformants were obtained using plasmid dna isolated from  <dig> cmy+ and  <dig> cmy- strains. ceftriaxone was used to select cmy+ plasmids, and chloramphenicol was used to select cmy- plasmids because this resistance has been found to be part of the inca/c plasmid backbone  <cit> .

all the transformants carrying the inca/c plasmids also displayed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, streptomycin and tetracycline. resistance to gentamicin was conferred by most of the cmy+ plasmids, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol resistance was mostly detected in the plasmids containing the ip- <dig> integron . resistance to neither kanamycin nor nalidixic acid was transferred . these results indicate that the mdr phenotypes of st <dig> strains can be explained largely by the presence of inca/c plasmids.

psti restriction fingerprints
the plasmid profiles showed that all of the e. coli transformants carried one large plasmid of between  <dig> and  <dig> kb. these transformants were analyzed by psti restriction fingerprinting  <cit> . cluster analysis of the psti fingerprints showed two main plasmid types , which we named type i and type ii . all of the cmy+ plasmids were contained in type i and were distributed into three clusters . the cmy- plasmids were found in two distinct groups: one in type ii and the other in cluster b within type i, suggesting that the cmy- plasmids originated from two divergent inca/c plasmid types. to put our plasmids into context, inca/c cmy+ reference plasmids from e. coli ar <dig>  <cit>  and newport sn <dig>  <cit>  were included. the restriction profiles of these plasmids were related to our st <dig> type ii plasmids, which in contrast were all cmy-.

we compared the sampling information  and our previously generated genomic dna xbai macrorestriction patterns  <cit>  with the plasmid psti restriction patterns. the observed distribution of the plasmids among genomic backgrounds was consistent with a pattern of clonal spread. the most evident association was between xbai cluster ib and psti cluster e; these isolates came from sonora and were sampled in 2004- <dig> .

pcr screening and nucleotide sequence analysis of the plasmids
the e. coli transformants were subjected to pcr screening using primer pairs that detect seven regions  distributed throughout the reported inca/c plasmids  <cit> . all the plasmids were positive for the repa/c, flor and mer regions ; only one plasmid did not contain the mer region . the r- <dig> segment was detected in all the cmy+ plasmids but in none of the cmy- plasmids. we analyzed the cmy region assuming that the right junction would consist of an insertion of dsbc upstream of trac and that the left junction would consist of an insertion of tnpa downstream of traa . however, during the nucleotide sequence analysis, we realized that dsbc and the hypothetical protein  <dig> gene are part of the plasmid core of other closely related inca/c plasmids lacking the cmy island . thus, pcr d was also used to detect the insertion of the cmy island at the right junction, demonstrating the insertion of blc, suge and Δentr upstream of the  <dig> gene . to determine if the flanking region of traa is similar in the cmy+ and cmy- plasmids, the left junction was assessed by pcr b . as expected, the cmy- plasmids did not amplify the cmy junctions, whereas most of the cmy+ plasmids amplified the right and left junctions , indicating that with only one exception , the cmy island is inserted in the same position in these plasmids. the most variable regions of the inca/c plasmids were the r- <dig> segment and the ip- <dig> integron . r- <dig> was present only in a small fraction of the cmy+ plasmids, including all the plasmids that belong to cluster d. most  of the salmonella strains that were positive for the ip- <dig> integron transferred this region along with their inca/c plasmids. the exceptions were six cmy+ plasmids and four cmy- plasmids . the presence of integrons has been reported for other inca/c plasmids  <cit> .

ten strains representing different geographic locations, years and sources were chosen and their regions analyzed in the pcr screening were sequenced . the sequences were identical for all the plasmids ; only the mer region showed a single nucleotide substitution . it was surprising that even intergenic regions and third codon positions were invariable. blast searches showed that our sequences are identical  to the inca/c plasmids par <dig> , peh4h , pam <dig>  and psn <dig> ; are closely related  to the inca/c plasmids pip <dig> , pyr <dig> , pp <dig> , pp99- <dig>  and pmrv <dig> ; and are related  to pra <dig>   <cit> . the repa gene displays the repa/c <dig> allele described for other inca/c cmy+ plasmids  <cit> . call et al.  <cit>  reported that one of the most variable parts of the inca/c plasmids is the flor gene; the flor allele found in the st <dig> isolates is identical to that of psn <dig>  which differs from that of par <dig> by three non-synonymous substitutions. the trac-dsbc junction  of the cmy island  was found in all the plasmids mentioned above and in the recently described integrating conjugative element icepmijpn <dig> of proteus mirabilis . the finding that trac-dsbc is present in pip <dig>  pyr <dig>  pp <dig>  pp99- <dig>  pmrv <dig> and pra <dig>  which lack the cmy island, revealed that this gene cluster is part of a conserved core region of these closely related inca/c plasmids. however, this region did not match with any other plasmids in the database, and it was not amplified in the cmy- plasmids of st <dig> . therefore, to assess the insertion of the right cmy junction, a second marker was used: pcr d spanning from suge to the hypothetical protein  <dig> . the complete trava-tnpa right junction  of the cmy island was identical to that of the e. coli and newport plasmids, but only trava  was present in the other cmy- inca/c reference plasmids. this result indicates that this marker is the left cmy island junction. interestingly, the st <dig> cmy- plasmids did not amplify the trava region, indicating that the region around the cmy island is not present in these plasmids. r- <dig> and r- <dig> were found to be present in all the inca/c reference plasmids, with the only exception being peh4h, which lacks r- <dig>  the mer region was detected only in the e. coli par <dig> and newport plasmids; however, it was found to be related to other mer operons present in several plasmids such as prmh <dig> .

characterization of the cmy region
when we started this study, the only completely sequenced plasmid carrying blacmy- <dig> was that of the newport strain   <cit> . pcr mapping experiments were performed to compare the cmy region of our typhimurium isolates with that of newport psn <dig> . to determine if the blacmy- <dig> gene is present as an inverted repeat element as in psn <dig>  we performed pcr h and i, which we expected to produce bands of around  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively, based on the in silico prediction. the newport strain sn <dig> was used as a positive control for these amplifications. no bands were obtained with our typhimurium isolates, consistent with the notion that our isolates possess only a single blacmy- <dig> gene. we designed a set of primer pairs to amplify overlapping fragments covering the complete cmy region and to obtain the nucleotide sequence of one of our isolates, yuhs 07- <dig>  which is the most recent strain in our collection and which displays xbai and psti fingerprints prevalent in the st <dig> population. the  <dig> -bp sequence of yuhs07- <dig>  spanning from trav to trac was found to be identical to the corresponding region of psn <dig>   <cit> , and it has the same cmy region configuration as the e. coli plasmid par <dig>   <cit> .

southern blot hybridization of psti plasmid restriction fingerprints
representative examples of southern hybridizations of the psti fingerprints are shown in figure  <dig>  hybridization with the blacmy- <dig> probe demonstrated that all cmy+ plasmids were of giles type a  <cit> , displaying two hybridization bands of about  <dig> and  <dig>  kb. this type has been associated with plasmids that carry one copy of the cmy island, such as par <dig>  <cit> . the repa/c probe hybridized with the larger band in all the strains, which should be about  <dig> kb according to an in silico psti restriction of the complete sequence of par <dig>  this band also hybridized with the mer probe for most of the plasmids, in agreement with the in silico prediction. however, some polymorphisms were detected using the mer probe . the flor probe produced a single band of  <dig> kb, with one exception . finally, hybridizations were performed using the first two genes of ip- <dig> ; the aada region was not included in the probe because this gene has been associated with other integrons often present in inca/c plasmids, such as that of transposon tn <dig>  <cit> . most of the strains produced a hybridization band of  <dig> kb, but there were polymorphisms .

conjugative transfer of inca/c plasmids
ten cmy+ and seven cmy- st <dig> isolates were evaluated for conjugative transfer of their a/c plasmids to e. coli dh5α. transconjugants were only obtained for the cmy+ strain yuhs 05- <dig> and at a very low frequency , but they were positive for all nine pcr markers of the donor plasmid, which lacked the mer region . however, no transconjugants were observed when an e. coli strain carrying the yuhs 05- <dig> cmy+ plasmid was used as the donor. the highest efficiencies were obtained with a donor:recipient ratio of 1: <dig> and an incubation for  <dig> hr on a solid medium . in our hands, conjugation efficiencies for ar <dig> and sn <dig> strains were in the order of 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  respectively. nevertheless, these frequencies were lower than those reported for these plasmids   <cit> .

discussion
distribution of inca/c plasmids within typhimurium genotypes and across geographic regions
we found an association between the typhimurium st <dig> genotype and large inca/c plasmids. these plasmids accounted for most of the mdr phenotypes of the strains, and they might be related to the ecological success of this recently emerging clone in mexico. in a previous study, we reported a trend towards the replacement of the founder st <dig> by the derived st <dig> in four regions of mexico. we suggested that the carriage of blacmy- <dig> by some of the st <dig> strains could only partially explain their increased prevalence because half of the st <dig> strains do not harbour blacmy- <dig>  in the present study, we discovered that the cmy- strains also harbour large inca/c plasmids with several resistance determinants. the lack of pstv and the carriage of inca/c plasmids are remarkable features of the st <dig> genotype in the mexican typhimurium population. we speculate that st <dig> arose as a clone lacking pstv and that this condition allowed the acquisition of the large inca/c plasmids. the success of this association could be due to antimicrobial pressure exerted by human clinical and animal-production practices on the typhimurium population.

we previously detected several associations among chromosomal genotypes and accessory genes  <cit> , suggesting that the population subgroups generated by these associations could be explained by several evolutionary processes, such as barriers to genetic exchange, genetic drift or recent clonal expansions within the typhimurium population. the present study reveals the tight association between the st <dig> genotype and inca/c plasmids. associations between plasmid type and chromosomal genotype have been reported for other salmonella serovars, such as newport  <cit>  and typhi  <cit> . daniels et al.  <cit>  described the relationship between newport and its plasmids as clonal based on the model proposed by souza and eguiarte  <cit> , implying that strong co-evolution may be occurring between the plasmid and the host, with very limited plasmid transfer among bacteria.

the plasmid types appear to cluster geographically. all the yucatán isolates carry type i plasmids, while all the isolates from sonora carry only type ii plasmids. isolates from michoacán and san luis potosí harbour plasmids from both types i  and ii. these patterns demonstrate a distribution gradient of the inca/c plasmids from the northern  to the southern  part of mexico, with intermediate levels in the middle part of mexico . this gradient is also related to the higher number of resistances conferred by the type i plasmids than by the cmy- type ii plasmids . these trends provide information for understanding the ecology and epidemiology of the emergent st <dig> genotype in mexico, and they increase our knowledge of the evolution of mdr in typhimurium.

mobility of the st <dig> inca/c plasmids
the conjugation frequencies reported for inca/c cmy+ plasmids are highly variable. welch et al.  <cit>  reported a lack of transferability for the newport inca/c plasmids, while poole et al.  <cit>  observed conjugation frequencies between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  but only when other replicons were present and co-transferred. on the other hand, most studies have reported that typhimurium plasmids are non-conjugative  <cit>  or transfer at moderate frequencies   <cit> . in the present study, we found that only one of the inca/c plasmids tested was able to conjugate, albeit at very low frequencies . the only distinctive feature of this yuhs 05- <dig>   <dig> kb cmy+ plasmid is its lack of the mer region. it has been suggested that the inability of salmonella cmy+ plasmids to conjugate is due to the insertion of the cmy island into the tra operon on the plasmid backbone  <cit> . however, the conjugative plasmid yuhs 05- <dig> has the cmy island inserted in between traa and trac, and this is also true for almost all the other cmy+ plasmids. we think that the reduced conjugative ability of the inca/c plasmids in salmonella might be due to chromosomally encoded factors, such as the thickness of the cell envelope, rather than to plasmid-encoded features, or it may depend on the presence of additional helper plasmids, as previously suggested  <cit> . the predominant lack of conjugation ability of our inca/c plasmids agrees with the clonal dissemination trend detected between chromosomal backgrounds and plasmid patterns, as revealed by xbai and psti digests , respectively. this study provides evidence of frequent rearrangements shaping the genetic composition of the inca/c plasmids harboured by st <dig> strains. it is possible that the inca/c plasmids circulating in typhimurium were acquired from other salmonella serotypes or other enteric bacteria such as e. coli. the higher plasmid diversity and conjugation frequencies of e. coli in comparison with salmonella led daniels et al.  <cit>  to speculate that insertions and deletions that occur during promiscuous plasmid sharing among e. coli isolates occasionally result in plasmids that are successful in salmonella. it is possible that this is the scenario in mexico, where resistance to ceftriaxone was detected in e. coli several years prior to that in salmonella .

evolutionary origin of the two inca/c types
the combined results of the pcr screening and the nucleotide sequence analysis suggest that the inca/c plasmids from types i and ii have a recent common origin and are evolving by the insertion/deletion of dna stretches rather than by point mutations, in agreement with the conclusions derived from other studies  <cit> . for example, in this study, insertion of the ip- <dig> integron  and deletion of the r- <dig> segment were observed in most of the cmy+ plasmids.

the pcr markers and plasmid sizes of the inca/c cmy+ reference plasmids of e. coli ar <dig>  <cit>  and newport sn <dig>  <cit>  corresponded with those of our typhimurium inca/c cmy+ plasmids. however, their psti restriction profiles were related to type ii plasmids, which included most of our typhimurium inca/c cmy- plasmids . as the cmy+ reference plasmids and our type ii plasmids were found to be similar, we speculate that the st <dig> inca/c cmy+ plasmids diversified from a type ii ancestor by the insertion and deletion of dna segments such as r- <dig> and the ip- <dig> integron, among others. likewise, hybridization assays showed that this integron mapped to some of the bands that are absent in the type ii restriction profiles . despite the nucleotide identity of the sequenced regions of the cmy- plasmids, and aside from ip- <dig>  they share only three of the ten genetic markers  that have been used to study the inca/c plasmids, indicating that they belong to an inca/c plasmid lineage that has not been thoroughly studied yet. the flor allele of the cmy+ and cmy- plasmids was identical to that of psn <dig>  but the cmy region of the cmy+ plasmids was identical to the region of par <dig>  suggesting a mosaic pattern of ancestry with plasmids from other salmonella serovars and e. coli. moreover, the type ii cmy- plasmids were found to be smaller , consistent with the notion that the cmy+ plasmids are the result of the insertion of dna modules into a type ii precursor plasmid. a formal alternative would be that a substantial loss of dna fragments originally present in the cmy+ plasmids occurred, giving raise to st <dig> type ii derivatives. in this respect, it would be necessary to obtain the full sequence of some of our cmy+ and cmy- plasmids to identify their genetic compositions and to unravel their evolutionary histories.

CONCLUSIONS
the ecological success of the newly emerging typhimurium st <dig> genotype may be related to the carriage of inca/c plasmids. two divergent genetic types of inca/c plasmids were identified. type i plasmids are the most abundant and widespread; their genetic compositions are similar to those of other reported inca/c plasmids. type ii plasmids display a lower number of psti restriction fragments and are smaller than type i plasmids. only three of the ten plasmid regions analyzed were detected in type ii plasmids, even though the nucleotide sequences for these regions were identical for both types. we conclude that type i and ii plasmids originated from a common ancestor and that the insertion and deletion of dna stretches have shaped their evolutionary histories.
