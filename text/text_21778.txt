BACKGROUND

actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a highly adapted pathogen that causes porcine pleuropneumonia, which is an extremely contagious respiratory disease  <cit> . the disease is often fatal and characterized by fibrinous, hemorrhagic, and necrotic lung lesions, which remains an important global problem in the swine industry  <cit> . transmission of the pathogen occurs through an aerosol route during close contact with diseased pigs or asymptomatic carriers, and it can infect pigs of different ages  <cit> . the clinical features can span from peracute disease with quick death to chronic infection leading to reduced growth rates, and the pigs frequently become asymptomatic carriers. to date,  <dig> serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae have been identified and all serovars can cause disease  <cit> . although the incidence of outbreaks has reduced in the developed countries, a. pleuropneumoniae remains one of the main causes of economic loss to the global swine production, especially in developing countries  <cit> .

antimicrobial therapy has been used to prevent and control porcine pleuropneumonia, but it results in the growing problems of multidrug-resistance and antibiotic residues in pigs . concern was raised that multidrug-resistance could be transmitted between different pathogens in pigs followed through the food chain to produce a risk to human health. thus, vaccination becomes the most effective method of preventing a. pleuropneumoniae infection. it has been found that pigs surviving natural infection were protected against homologous and heterologous serovar infection  <cit> . it is speculated that live bacteria can induce in vivo expression of protective antigens and confer cross-protection. thus, the application of an attenuated live vaccine is an ideal approach for vaccination against diversified serovars of a. pleuropneumoniae  <cit> .

clpp protease is a family of atp-dependent protease, which plays a key role in the degradation of misfolded proteins and the stress tolerance in bacteria  <cit> . the role of clpp as an important virulence factor has been demonstrated in several pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . a previous study of salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis also showed that the virulence of clpp deletion mutants were remarkably decreased and that these mutants can serve as live oral vaccine candidates  <cit> . in our previously study, the clpp-deleted mutant of a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <dig>  a prevalent serovar in china, was constructed and its physiological features were analyzed. the clpp protease mediates a. pleuropneumoniae tolerance to multiple environmental stressors, affects the biofilm formation, and may play a critical role in the virulence regulation  <cit> . the apxii toxin is the most important virulence factor in a. pleuropneumoniae serovar  <dig>  and is encoded by the apxiica gene cluster. the apxiia gene encodes the apxiia toxin structural protein, and the apxiic gene encodes the post-translational activating protein that is essential for the apxii toxin activation, thus disruption in the apxiic gene of a. pleuropneumoniae results in secretion of the inactive apxii toxin but with full antigenicity  <cit> .

in the present study, we constructed the double-deletion mutant s-8△clpp△apxiic of a. pleuropneumoniae and evaluated the feasibility of its use as a live attenuated negative marker vaccine based on the virulence, changes in clinical symptoms, immune responses, and protective effects in pigs against challenge with the homologous and heterologous a. pleuropneumoniae strains.

methods
experimental animals
one hundred and ten 6-week-old female balb/c mice  were used in the study, with identical feeding conditions. a total of  <dig> piglets were obtained for use in this study from a farm that was free from a. pleuropneumoniae and other respiratory pathogens including streptococcus suis, haemophilus parasuis, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus . the  <dig> piglets were randomly divided into nine groups of same number and were separately fed with same feeding conditions. the animal experiment in this study was approved by the animal ethics committee of harbin veterinary research institute of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences  and carried out in strict accordance with animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols.

bacterial strains and growth conditions

a. pleuropneumoniae strains s- <dig> , shope  <dig> , k <dig> , the s-8△clpp mutant and the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant were grown at 37 °c in tryptic soy broth  or tryptic soy agar   containing nicotinamide dinucleotide .

chromosomal inactivation of the apxiic gene of s-8△clpp
primers iiclf/iiclr, and iicrf/iicrr  were used to amplify the two segments flanking with the apxiic gene, iic-l and iic-r, as the recombination homologous arms. using single-overlap extension pcr , the fragment with a 270 bp internal deletion in the apxiic gene  was generated, and cloned into the conjugative vector pemoc <dig>  <cit>  to construct plasmid pem△apxiic. using e. coli β <dig> and a single-step transconjugation system  <cit> , plasmid pem△apxiic was applied to introduce the apxiic mutation into the s-8△clpp mutant. after two homologous recombination steps, the a. pleuropneumoniae s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant strain was verified by pcr and sequencing using iicjdf/iicjdr primers.table  <dig> characteristics of bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study

RESULTS
construction of the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant strain
to construct the double-deletion mutant s-8△clpp△apxiic, we deleted the apxiic gene of a. pleuropneumoniae s-8△clpp mutant via the allelic exchange of the wild-type apxiic gene with an unmarked, in-frame deletion lacking 270 bp of the apxiic orf . to test the stability of the in-frame deleted apxiic gene in the genome of the a. pleuropneumoniae s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant, a pcr assay was performed on the genomes of the mutant from  <dig> passages to detect a 294-bp dna fragment characteristic of the in-frame deleted apxiic. this fragment was observed in all  <dig> consecutive passages , suggesting a stable in-frame deletion in the s-8△clpp△apxiic genome.fig.  <dig> characterization of the a. pleuropneumoniae mutant s-8△clp△apxiic. a schematic representation of the a. pleuropneumoniae apxiic locus. binding locations for the primers iiclf/iiclr and iicrf/iicrr used to amplify the two flanking regions  of the apxiic gene were shown in the schematic, and primers iicjdf/iicjdr were used to identify the s-8△clp△apxiic mutant  and s-8△clp mutant . the shadowed domain represents a 270 bp in-frame deletion in the apxiic gene, hp indicates the encoding gene of the hypothetical protein. b pcr identification of the s-8△clp△apxiic mutant using the primers iicjdf/iicjdr. for lane  <dig>  the identified s-8△clp△apxiic mutant ; for other lanes, the single crossover mutant . c pcr identification of the  <dig> passages of the s-8△clp△apxiic mutant. for lanes 1– <dig>   <dig> successive passages of the s-8△clp△apxiic mutant; for lane m, dl <dig> dna molecular marker

discussion
with the growing emergence of drug resistance and the problem of antibiotic residues, vaccination becomes the most effective method of preventing a. pleuropneumoniae infection  <cit> . previous studies found that pigs surviving natural infection of a. pleuropneumoniae could be fully protected against homologous strain and partially against heterologous serovars, suggesting that live bacteria likely induced in vivo expression of protective antigens and conferred cross-protection  <cit> . thus, an attenuated live vaccine is widely acknowledged as an ideal approach for vaccination against porcine pleuropneumonia.

the ideal live vaccine of porcine pleuropneumonia should be low virulent and cause minimum lung lesions  <cit> . our previous study constructed s-8△clpp, an a. pleuropneumoniae clpp gene deletion mutant, and illustrated the important function of the clpp protease in the stress response and biofilm formation of a. pleuropneumoniae, suggesting a putative role for clpp protease in the virulence regulation  <cit> . afterwards, the virulence of s-8△clpp was determined using the balb/c mouse infection model. the finding that the s-8△clpp moderately attenuated by approximately 71-fold  was unexpected as a previous study had found that clpp deletion strains of s. typhimurium and s. enteritidis were attenuated by approximately  <dig> -fold  <cit> . thus, in this study, we further deleted the apxiic gene that encodes the apxii activating protein, and rendered the double-deletion mutant s-8△clpp△apxiic secreting unactivated apxii toxins but with complete antigenicity  <cit> . compared to the wild-type strain, s-8△clpp△apxiic was greatly attenuated by approximately 1195-fold. we next evaluated the virulence of s-8△clpp△apxiic in pigs via intranasal inoculation, with the results showing that pigs inoculated with  <dig>  × 107 cfu of the s-8△clpp mutant displayed no clinical signs of porcine pleuropneumonia but exhibited only transient depression when inoculated with  <dig>  × 109 cfu. moreover, there are no or little lung lesions in the pigs of the s-8△clpp△apxiic-inoculated group, which showed that the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant was adequately attenuated and has almost no detrimental effects on pigs that remained healthy throughout the experiment.

an essential characteristic for an effective attenuated live vaccine is that the strain should remain highly immunogenic  <cit> . pigs vaccinated with the a. pleuropneumoniae s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant exhibited a significantly increased apxii-specific igg ab response compared to pigs injected with pbs. interestingly, both a. pleuropneumoniae-specific igg <dig> and igg <dig> titers increased following the first immunization and booster immunization. the production of igg isotypes in pig is elicited by type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  cytokines, which lead the responses to a cell-mediated or antibody-mediated immune response  <cit> . in pigs, igg <dig> is linked to the production of ifn-γ and il- <dig> and correlates with the th <dig> response  <cit> . conversely, the production of the specific igg <dig> antibody partially relies on the presence of the th <dig> cytokine il- <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we also found that on day  <dig>  the levels of ifn-γ, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> were significantly higher in sera from s-8△clpp△apxiic immunized pigs than those in sera from pbs control groups, but il- <dig> concentrations were lower than ifn-γ and il- <dig> concentrations in sera from the immunization groups. these data suggested that immunization with a. pleuropneumoniae s-8△clpp△apxiic generated a slight bias towards the th1-type immune response. however, the igg <dig> titers and il- <dig> concentrations in the s-8△clpp△apxiic immunized pigs were still much higher than those in the pbs control groups. these data showed that the th2-type immune response also plays a partial role in immunization with live a. pleuropneumoniae s-8△clpp△apxiic. unlike the other a. pleuropneumoniae live attenuated mutant that is significantly biased toward a th1-type immune response  <cit> , s-8△clpp△apxiic generated a more balanced and broader immune response.

cross-protection is a crucial characteristic that is important to achieve widespread use of a vaccine. our findings demonstrated that immunization with the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant could induce acquired immunity and confer a marked resistance against the lethal challenge with a. pleuropneumoniae virulent homologous strain s- <dig> and heterologous serovar 5a. although s-8△clpp△apxiic exhibited good immune protection as a live vaccine, a few pigs after challenge still had few pathological lesions. as it is unlikely that the multiple-gene deleted mutant can revert back to the wild-type genotype, we will further delete other important virulence genes of a. pleuropneumoniae in our future studies and construct a multiple-gene deleted mutant as a safe, attenuated live vaccine to prevent and control a. pleuropneumoniae infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, data presented in this study indicated that the immunizations with the candidate vaccine s-8△clpp△apxiic were safe in pigs; and conferred efficient protection against the homologous or heterologous serovar infection. overall, the s-8△clpp△apxiic mutant of a. pleuropneumoniae has the potential as a novel live attenuated vaccine against porcine pleuropneumonia, although further trials are needed.
