BACKGROUND
strains of arthrobacter species are among the predominant members of culturable aerobic soil bacteria and are thought to play a significant role in the biodegradation of organic matter
 <cit> . they have been detected in the deep subsurface and in extreme environments
 <cit>  and appear to be abundant in heavy metal-contaminated sites
 <cit> . arthrobacter spp. also contribute to the bacterial community in activated sludge of wastewater treatment systems
 <cit> ; under conditions of unstable organic loading, arthrobacter sp. and other gram-positives with a rod-coccus cycle were even found to be prevalent
 <cit> . the ubiquity of arthrobacter strains is considered to be due to their nutritional versatility and their pronounced resistance to desiccation, long-term starvation, and environmental stress
 <cit> . a number of arthrobacter strains harbor plasmids, which contribute to heavy metal resistance or confer catabolic traits
 <cit> .

the complete genome sequences of five environmental arthrobacter species are available. a. aurescens tc <dig>  a. chlorophenolicus a <dig> and a. phenanthrenivorans sphe <dig> were isolated from soil for their ability to degrade atrazine, 4-chlorophenol, and phenanthrene, respectively
 <cit> , and the type strain of a. globiformis  also is a soil isolate
 <cit> . arthrobacter sp. fb <dig> was obtained from a microcosm that contained chromate, lead- and hydrocarbon-contaminated soils
 <cit> . genome analyses indicated that soil isolates like strains tc <dig> and fb <dig> have a large number of genes encoding stress-related proteins. as expected, the metabolic diversity and niche specialization of the environmental arthrobacter strains is reflected in their genomes. a. aurescens tc <dig>  for example, appears specialized with respect to its ability to utilize a broad variety of amines and other nitrogenous compounds. carbohydrate polymers are another metabolic niche of both a. aurescens tc <dig> and arthrobacter sp. fb24
 <cit> . in contrast to these environmental arthrobacter strains, a. arilaitensis re <dig> is an isolate from the surface of cheese, characterized by efficient iron acquisition and salt-tolerance systems and the ability to utilize carbon substrates present in cheese such as lactic acid and fatty acids
 <cit> .

arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a was previously isolated from sludge of the biological wastewater treatment plant of a coal tar refinery in castrop-rauxel, germany, based on its ability to utilize quinaldine  as source of carbon and energy
 <cit> . methylquinolines, quinoline and other n-heteroaromatic compounds are constituents of shale oil and coal tar. since many quinoline derivatives are considered toxic and/or mutagenic, they are of environmental concern. quinolines are more polar than their homocyclic naphthalene analogs, consequently they are more readily transported to subsoil and groundwater if entering the environment, e.g., from wood-creosoting activities or abandoned coal and oil processing facilities. a number of bacterial isolates, mainly aerobes from soil, with the ability to degrade certain quinoline derivatives have been described in the literature .

in the upper part of the quinaldine degradation pathway of arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a, quinaldine is oxidized to carbon monoxide, acetate, and anthranilate
 <cit> . the genes coding for the enzymes of the “upper pathway” are clustered on a conjugative plasmid, previously termed pal <dig>  which in contrast to other arthrobacter plasmids described until now has a linear topology
 <cit> . anthranilate has been proposed to be metabolized via catechol and subsequent intradiol cleavage, or via a coa-thioester pathway involving anthranilate coa-ligase and a putative anthraniloyl-coa monooxygenase/reductase encoded on the pal <dig> plasmid
 <cit> . however, the full catabolic potential of arthrobacter strain rue61a has not yet been characterized. we therefore analyzed the complete genome of the strain and performed physiological tests as well as an analysis of the coa-metabolome to complement the genome-based reconstruction of metabolic pathways. the availability of several arthrobacter genomes provides the opportunity for comparative studies towards a better understanding of the molecular basis of the versatility and environmental robustness of this genus.

RESULTS
general genome features and comparative genomics
the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a comprises a circular chromosome of  <dig> ,495 bp, one circular plasmid parue <dig> of  <dig>  bp, and a smaller linear plasmid parue <dig> of  <dig>  bp . the average g + c content is  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the linear plasmid parue <dig> was already sequenced in  <dig> 
 <cit> . the chromosome and the plasmids contain  <dig>  open reading frames , six copies of rrna operons,  <dig> trnas and  <dig> pseudogenes. it shows an average coding percentage of 90%.  <dig>  of the protein-coding genes were assigned with a putative function and  <dig>  genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins. altogether,  <dig>  protein-coding genes could be assigned to clusters of orthologous groups  categories . the assignment to the cog categories is nearly identical to those of other sequenced arthrobacter strains isolated from soil
 <cit> . twenty-two%  of all coding dna sequences  of arthrobacter sp. rue61a were clustered into  <dig> paralogous families ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> members per family.

comparison of the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a with the genomes of all available arthrobacter strains revealed a. aurescens tc <dig> as the closest relative . the chromosomes of the two organisms show an overall similarity of approximately 86% on amino acid level, which conform to  <dig> orfs of the two chromosomes . arthrobacter sp. fb <dig> is the next closed related organism with  <dig> homologous orfs followed by a. globiformis nbrc  <dig>  a. chlorophenolicus a <dig> and a. phenanthrenivorans sphe <dig> with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> orfs, respectively. a. arilaitensis re <dig> is the most distant related organism and shares  <dig> homologous orfs. in contrast, the chromosomes of all arthrobacter strains share only  <dig> homologous orfs.

analyses of the best blast hits  of the whole genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a revealed  <dig> orfs that phylogenetically affiliated to phyla other than actinobacteria or without an assigned phylogenetic origin. these results conform to the prediction of putative genomic islands  using the islandviewer online tool
 <cit> . thirteen putative genomic islands were identified on the chromosome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a encoding  <dig> genes .

the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a harbors a high number of genes associated with transport. overall  <dig> putative transporters and binding proteins were identified. this represents about 13% of the cdss of the whole genome.  <dig> of these transporters associated proteins are identical or closely related to these encoded in the genome of strain tc <dig>  a predominant part of transporters-associated genes which are not related to those of tc <dig>  are located on genomic islands  or on plasmid parue <dig>  .

osmoprotection systems
soil microorganisms are exposed to frequent changes of the external osmolarity. bacterial response to hyperosmotic stress usually involves a multiphasic adaptation, comprising a transient accumulation of potassium ions and an increase in the intracellular concentration of organic osmoprotectants by uptake and synthesis
 <cit> .

secondary carriers of the trk/ktr family have been proposed to play an important role in the initial adjustment to an osmotic upshift. they are oligomeric complexes consisting of an ion-conducting transmembrane component associated with at least one regulatory, dinucleotide-binding component; trk and ktr systems are thought to differ with respect to the ion co-transported with k+, using h+ and na+, respectively
 <cit> . a putative trkh transporter  and its regulatory protein trka  were identified in the genome of strain rue61a; two additional homologues of trka are encoded on the chromosome, and the gene for another possible trkh-type membrane protein is located on the circular plasmid parue <dig> .

arthrobacter sp. rue61a has a number of uptake systems for organic osmoprotectants, as suggested by the identification of several genes predicted to code for possible proline/betaine transport systems of the major facilitator superfamily , a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter  family protein , which shows approximately 45% identity to the high-affinity, na+-coupled glycine betaine symporter betp of corynebacterium glutamicum , and three abc-type glycine betaine/carnitine/choline or proline/betaine transporters. choline probably can serve as substrate for glycine betaine biosynthesis, which involves two oxidation steps. the gene product of arue_c <dig> shares 89% sequence identity with choline oxidase of a. globiformis , which catalyzes betaine-aldehyde formation. a putative betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase  is encoded by the adjacent locus.

besides accumulating osmoprotectants from the environment, arthrobacter sp. rue61a also seems to be capable of synthesizing compatible solutes de novo. analogous to the situation in mycobacteria
 <cit>  and in corynebacterium glutamicum <cit> , three putative pathways are present for the formation of trehalose. the arue_c <dig> and arue_c <dig> loci were predicted to code for trehalose synthases , which catalyze a transglycosylation reaction to isomerize maltose to trehalose. however, tres could rather be involved in trehalose degradation via maltose rather than trehalose synthesis. genes predicted to code for trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, comprising the otsab pathway for trehalose synthesis from udp-d-glucose and α-d-glucose-6-phosphate, as well as the genes for the alternative treyz pathway for trehalose formation from maltodextrins are located on the chromosome of strain rue61a .

besides glycine betaine and trehalose, ectoine and the amino acids proline and glutamate are among the most widely used compatible solutes in bacteria
 <cit> . while strain rue61a probably is capable of scavenging ectoine from the environment via secondary or abc transporters, it apparently lacks the ability of de novo synthesis, as genes coding for homologues of the biosynthesis enzymes ectabc and ectoine hydroxylase  were not identified. in contrast, it appears to be capable of synthesizing proline from glutamate by the universal pathway encoded by prob , proa , and proc . genes encoding the two enzymes catalyzing glutamate synthesis are also predicted, namely, a homooligomeric nadp+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, and a glutamate synthase .

whereas k+ uptake and accumulation of organic osmoprotectants by both uptake and synthesis contribute to adaptation of bacteria to hyperosmotic conditions, the initial response to sudden hypoosmotic shock is mediated by mechanosensitive ion channels, which act as “emergency valves” by releasing cytoplasmic solutes, relieving turgor pressure and preventing cell lysis
 <cit> . candidate genes for both mechanosensitive ion channels mscl and mscs were identified on the chromosome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a. all in all, the diversity of osmoprotection systems identified suggests that strain rue61a is well adapted to cope with osmotic stress conditions.

endogenous generation of reactive oxygen species and protection against oxidative stress
reactive oxygen species  are inevitable by-products of aerobic metabolism. besides the respiratory enzymes, which are a source of superoxide, aerobic organisms have evolved a plethora of oxygenases and oxidases that use molecular oxygen as cosubstrate and electron acceptor, respectively. among these oxidoreductases, especially the flavoenzymes have been identified as a major source of endogenous ros
 <cit> . additionally, soil microorganisms may be exposed to redox-active secondary metabolites which can contribute to ros formation
 <cit> .

arthrobacter sp. rue61a contains many genes encoding  oxidases that generate h2o <dig> and possibly also release superoxide anion radicals as by-product. genome analysis suggested the presence of three potential amino acid oxidases, two putative pyranose 2-oxidases, two sugar alcohol oxidases, putrescine oxidase, urate oxidase, and a number of other predicted oxidases. moreover, there are a number of gene products that could be either oxidases or dehydrogenases, such as xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase encoded by arue_c35300– <dig>  the sulfite oxidase family proteins, or proteins predicted to belong to the acyl-coa dehydrogenase/oxidase superfamily .

for the detoxification of h2o <dig>  which besides causing oxidative damage of -clusters in proteins can generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical through the fenton reaction
 <cit> , strain rue61a contains three chromosomally encoded catalases, namely, a probable mn-containing catalase and two different heme-binding catalases. genome analysis additionally revealed a putative glutathione peroxidase, a possible peroxidase with a c2c3h7g motif  encoded by arue_c <dig>  another peroxidase-related protein  and several putative peroxiredoxins . these enzymes may catalyze the reduction of different organic hydroperoxides. detoxification of superoxide is effected by a fe/mn-superoxide dismutase encoded by arue_c <dig>  interestingly, the linear plasmid parue <dig> carries an additional gene  of an fe/mn-superoxide dismutase, which may be linked to quinaldine catabolism
 <cit> . the initial reaction of the degradation pathway is catalyzed by quinaldine 4-oxidase, encoded by the genes arue_113p00040–00060
 <cit> , which likely enhances internal oxidative stress when the cells are growing on quinaldine as carbon source.

like many other bacterial genomes outside of the enterobacteria, the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a lacks the soxs regulatory gene but contains a soxr homologue , which codes for a -containing transcription factor that presumably mediates a response to redox-active metabolites. the soxr regulon has been characterized most intensely for pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptomyces coelicolor, which produce the redox-cycling secondary metabolites pyocyanin and actinorhodin, respectively. for these bacteria, it has been hypothesized that soxr has evolved to respond to their own redox-active pigments, stimulating the transcription of genes that code for proteins to process and to export these metabolites
 <cit> . however, gene clusters that could code for the biosynthesis of phenazines or polyketides were not detected in the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a. if the strain indeed does not produce redox-active secondary metabolites, its soxr regulon may be involved in defense against exogenous redox-active compounds.

acquisition of iron
like other aerobic microorganisms, arthrobacter sp. is confronted with the problem of low availability of iron ions in the oxic environment at neutral ph. in order to solubilize ferric iron, a common strategy used by bacteria is to synthesize and secrete high-affinity extracellular ferric chelators, called siderophores, and take up the fe3+/siderophore complexes via active transport. typical siderophores chelate fe3+ via hydroxamate, 2-hydroxycarboxylate or catecholate ligands
 <cit> .

interestingly, the predicted products of the arue_c02640– <dig> gene cluster exhibit sequence similarity  to rhbb, rhbe, rhbd and rhbf of sinorhizobium meliloti which catalyze schizokinen formation from  <dig> -diaminobutyrate, acetyl-coa and citrate
 <cit> , suggesting that arthrobacter sp. rue61a may produce a schizokinen-like siderophore. schizokinen from bacillus megaterium and arthrobactin from arthrobacter pascens are dihydroxamates, composed of citric acid symmetrically substituted via amide linkages to two residues of 1-amino-3-propane and 1-amino-5-pentane, respectively
 <cit> . schizokinen is also the direct biosynthetic precursor of rhizobactin-1021
 <cit> , a siderophore produced by s. meliloti  <dig> 

the proteins encoded by the arue_c39970– <dig> gene cluster belong to the ceud, ceuc, ceub and ceua families and thus may represent a system that transports fe3+/catecholate-type siderophore complexes. apart from a predicted isochorismate synthase , genes for the biosynthesis of the catecholate siderophore precursor  <dig> -dihydroxybenzoate and gene clusters for non-ribosomal siderophore peptide synthetase components were not detected, suggesting that the ceu-like proteins contribute to acquisition of xenosiderophore/fe3+ complexes . at large, strain rue61a forms five abc transporters for the uptake of fe3+/siderophore complexes .

the gene products of the arue_c <dig>  arue_c <dig> and arue_c <dig> loci show about 49%, 59% and 66% identity to the sfuc, sfub and sfua proteins, respectively, of serratia marcescens <cit> . in contrast to siderophore-mediated iron uptake processes, which involve internalization of the entire fe3+/siderophore complexes, the sfuabc  system binds and transports free ferric ions. in pathogenic bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae, the fbpabc system is required for ferric iron acquisition from the host's iron binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin, and it also contributes to the utilization of some xenosiderophores as iron sources
 <cit> . sequence similarities of the arue_c07040– <dig> proteins to fbpabc of h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae are lower than towards sfuabc , however, the amino acid ligands, which in h. influenzae fbpa coordinate the fe3+ ion 
 <cit> , are conserved in the arue_c <dig> protein. homologous proteins can be identified in other arthrobacter spp. and in rhodococci, suggesting that these gram-positive soil bacteria may be able to scavenge ferric ions by means of a an fbpa-like extracellular fe3+-binding protein and an fe3+-specific abc transporter. two fur homologs coding for regulators that sense fe2+ or other divalent metal ions and control metal ion homeostasis were identified in the genome .

response to heavy metal ions
metal ions are usually toxic if present in excess, mainly due to their reactivity with thiol compounds and the thiolate and imidazolium groups of cysteine and histidine residues, respectively. some divalent metal ions such as cd2+ tend to substitute physiologically essential metal ions that act as enzyme cofactors or as structural constituents of proteins.

co2+, ni2+, cu2+ and zn2+ ions inhibited growth of arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a at approximately 2 mm, whereas cd2+, a metal ion without known biological function, was effective already at μm concentrations . uptake systems for macronutrients like mg2+, sulfate and phosphate generally exhibit a broad specificity, consequently the uptake of toxic metal ions and metal oxyanions cannot be down-regulated on the level of transport activity
 <cit> . energy-dependent efflux is therefore the primary mechanism for the detoxification of metal ions
 <cit> . the czcd-like proteins encoded by arue_c <dig> and arue_232p <dig> belong to the cation diffusion facilitator  family of antiporters
 <cit>  and might contribute to the observed moderate degree of zn2+ and co2+ tolerance of strain rue61a. the gene arue_232p <dig> codes for a putative antiporter that is related to the nreb protein of plasmid ptom <dig> of alcaligenes xylosoxidans strain 31a , but since it lacks the characteristic histidine-rich carboxy terminus
 <cit> , its possible role in nickel efflux is uncertain. a putative copc-related protein, also encoded on the linear plasmid, presumably contributes to copper homeostasis by sequestration of copper ions .

the strain was grown in nutrient broth , and growth was recorded after 48 h.

a number of important efflux systems for heavy metal cations are p-type atpases. copa is a cu+/ag+-atpase
 <cit> , the znta protein mediates resistance to zn2+, cd2+ and pb2+ and has low activities with ni2+, co2+ and cu2+ <cit> , cada is a cd2+ transporter also active with pb2+, and pbra mediates pb2+ resistance
 <cit> . the p-type atpase encoded by arue_c <dig>  which includes an n-terminal heavy metal-associated hma domain  with the typical cxxc motif, is related to copa and thus is a likely candidate for a transporter that mediates cu+/ag+ efflux. the adjacent gene codes for a putative metal-binding chaperone that delivers the metal ion to the transporter. another putative metal-transporting p-type atpase is encoded by the arue_c <dig> locus, and the protein encoded by arue_232p <dig> shows similarity to copper-translocating atpases. the circular plasmid comprises two additional genes, arue_232p <dig> and arue_232p <dig>  of predicted cd2+/zn2+/pb2+-translocating p-type atpases . the deduced proteins have an n-terminal cxxd motif and additional conserved glutamate residues in their n-terminal region, reminiscent of the metal-associated motif of pbra
 <cit> . homologues of these genes can be identified in the genome of a. aurescens tc <dig> . we observed that growth of both arthrobacter sp. rue61a and a. aurescens tc <dig> in half-concentrated lb medium was inhibited by 5 mm pb <dig> . this is comparable to the mics of 5–10 mm pb <dig>  determined  for arthrobacter strains isolated from lead-zinc mine tailings
 <cit> . however, since lead precipitates with various anions and forms complexes with many organic compounds, its toxicity towards strains rue61a and tc <dig> was additionally assessed be measuring its effect on the respiration rate of resting cells suspended in buffer
 <cit> . the ic <dig> values  for lb-grown cells of strains rue61a and tc <dig>  deduced from dose–response curves , were approximately 143 μm and 189 μm pb <dig>  respectively. considering that ic <dig> values of 37 μm and 20 μm were reported for pb2+-induced and non-induced resting cells of arthrobacter sp. js <dig>  an isolate from a pb-contaminated industrial site
 <cit> , the resistance levels of arthrobacter strain rue61a and a. aurescens tc <dig> are remarkably high.

a putative mercuric reductase gene mera, flanked by a gene coding for a merr family transcriptional regulator, is represented by arue_232p <dig>  the gene product shares 59% sequence identity with mera of the hg-resistant streptomyces sp. strain chr <dig>  however, hgcl <dig> retarded growth of strain rue61a already at 3 μm, and complete inhibition occurred at 12 μm , indicating high sensitivity towards hg2+ ions.

chromate enters bacterial cells via the sulfate uptake system
 <cit> . whereas arthrobacter sp. strain fb <dig> exhibits high-level chromate resistance, surviving up to 200 mm potassium chromate, resistance levels of other arthrobacter species were in the range of  <dig> to 48 mm
 <cit> . growth of strain rue61a was unaffected by  <dig>  mm but inhibited by 5 mm chromate , suggesting only moderate tolerance. a widespread bacterial resistance mechanism is chromate efflux, mediated by the chra transporter
 <cit> , but a chra ortholog was not identified in the genome of strain rue61a. however, another mechanism of chromate resistance that seems to be wide-spread in bacteria is based on reduction to cr, which at physiological ph forms oxides and hydroxides that are poorly soluble and thus less bioavailable than the cr anions
 <cit> . chromate reduction was reported for a. crystallopoietes es <dig> and arthrobacter sp. strain cr47
 <cit> , but the genetic basis of the reductase activity was not analyzed. interestingly, the nadh-dependent fmn reductase encoded by arue_c <dig> is related to chromate reductases chrr of pseudomonas putida and yief of escherichia coli k12
 <cit> , sharing amino acid motifs that are highly conserved within chrr homologs. the ability to reduce chromate also seems to be a secondary function of several nadh:flavin oxidoreductases, such as some nitroreductases and ferric reductase
 <cit> . since candidate genes that may confer such secondary chromate reductase activities were identified on the chromosome , strain rue61a presumably is able to detoxify cr by reduction.

in oxic environments, arsenic predominates as arsenate, which is taken up by phosphate transporters and exerts toxicity by “uncoupling” oxidative phosphorylation due to formation of rapidly hydrolyzable arsenyl-adp
 <cit> . arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a was able to grow in the presence of up to 200 mm arsenate, albeit with prolonged lag phases at concentrations >10 mm arsenate . full growth inhibition was observed at 400 mm arsenate . aerobic microorganisms usually detoxify arsenate by reduction to arsenite, catalyzed by the cytoplasmic arsenate reductase arsc, and subsequent arsenite extrusion. arsenite formation by arsc must be closely coupled to arsenite efflux
 <cit> , because arsenite due to its thiolate-modifying activity is much more toxic than arsenate. growth of arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a was inhibited by  <dig>  mm arsenite . an arsb-like anion permease and a putative acr3-type arsenite efflux pump are encoded by arue_c <dig> and arue_232p <dig>  respectively.

a chromosomal gene cluster comprising arue_c37620– <dig> contains three arsc paralogs coding for putative arsenate reductases. interestingly, the genome of a. aurescens tc <dig> contains a total of five putative arsenate reductase genes. however, the observed mic of 200 mm and the prolonged lag phases of cultures of strain tc <dig> grown in the presence of  <dig> – 100 mm arsenate  indicate that this strain is more sensitive than strain rue61a, suggesting that the expression levels or the catalytic efficiencies of the arsenate detoxifying proteins rather than the number of putative detoxification genes govern the physiological response. nevertheless, both strains are highly resistant to arsenate. geobacillus kaustophilus hta426
 <cit> , bacillus cereus strain ag27
 <cit> , and b. subtilis strain b-1232
 <cit> , for example, exhibited mics of 80 mm, 40 mm, and 110 mm of arsenate, respectively. aerobic growth of eleven bacterial isolates from arsenic-contaminated groundwater was inhibited by arsenate concentrations in the range of 100–200 mm
 <cit> .

response to antibiotics
a plethora of antibiotics is produced by soil microorganisms. to counteract their effect, antibiotic producers as well as non-producing soil-dwelling bacteria have evolved various resistance factors, e.g., efflux transporters, or enzymes catalyzing derivatization or cleavage of the antibiotic
 <cit> .

agar disk diffusion tests indicated that arthrobacter sp. rue61a is sensitive towards ampicillin , lincomycin , the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin , and the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin  and tylosin . these results contrasted with the detection of a number of genes encoding mfs transporters of the emrb/qaca subfamily, several genes coding for abc transporters predicted to be involved in multidrug export , and genes of two small multidrug resistance proteins , putative rrna methyltransferases, a putative penicillin acylase, and several predicted β-lactamases. zones of inhibition by puromycin were observed at 10 μg/disk, suggesting that efficient efflux as mediated by a pur8-like transporter does not occur
 <cit> . in contrast, inhibition by the peptide antibiotic bacitracin occurred only at >100 μg/disk, indicating resistance. several abc-type systems are candidates for possible bacitracin efflux transporters . the atpase protein encoded by arue_c <dig> shows 38% sequence identity to bcea, a component of the bacitracin transporter bceab of bacillus subtilis strain  <dig>  the bceab genes of b. subtilis are located adjacent to bcrrs which code for an associated two-component regulatory system
 <cit> . the bcea homologue arue_c <dig>  and arue_c <dig> encoding a putative permease component, also co-localize with genes coding for a predicted sensor histidine kinase and response regulator. co-localization of abc transporter genes and genes of a two-component regulatory system is observed for two other gene clusters on the chromosome. the product of the arue_c <dig> gene is distantly related to the bcra protein of the bacitracin transporter of b. licheniformis . two other abc-type transporters  show weak similarity of their atpases with those of bacitracin transporters, but these systems lack co-localized sensor kinase and response regulator genes.

biodegradative capabilities
aromatic and n-heterocyclic compounds
arthrobacter sp. rue61a was originally isolated based on its ability to grow on quinaldine as sole source of carbon and energy. the enzymes of the “upper” part of the degradation pathway, which are encoded by arue_113p00040– <dig> , have been characterized previously
 <cit> . the intermediates 1h-4-oxoquinaldine and 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine of the pathway are structural analogs of the quorum sensing signaling molecules hhq -quinolone) and pqs -quinolone) of pseudomonas aeruginosa. the enzymes 1h-4-oxoquinaldine 3-monooxygenase and 1h-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine  <dig> -dioxygenase from strain rue61a are indeed capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of hhq to pqs  and the cleavage of pqs
 <cit> , respectively. however, the catalytic activities of the monooxygenase and the  <dig> -dioxygenase towards these signaling molecules are much lower than towards the physiological substrates, supporting the notion that the proteins have not evolved to act as a quorum quenching enzymes, but have a catabolic role.

anthranilate, the product of the “upper pathway” of quinaldine degradation by strain rue61a, has been proposed to be degraded via coa-thioester intermediates; an anthranilate coa ligase and a putative 2-aminobenzoyl-coa monooxygenase/reductase to form 2-amino-5-oxocyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-coa are encoded by arue_113p <dig> and arue_113p <dig>  respectively
 <cit>  . since the parue113-deficient mutant of strain rue61a is still able to grow on anthranilate, paralogs of these “lower pathway” genes must be present. probable candidate genes are arue_c <dig> and arue_c <dig>  respectively; the gene product of the latter shares 50% sequence identity with 2-aminobenzoyl-coa monooxygenase/reductase of azoarcus evansii <cit> . heterologous expression of the arue_113p <dig> and arue_c <dig> genes, inserted in the pet22b expression vector, in e. coli resulted in anthranilate-coa ligase activities of approximately  <dig>  u – <dig> in the cell extract supernatants, while extracts of e. coli cells harboring the empty vector did not show enzymatic activity towards anthranilate, confirming that the two genes code for anthranilate coa ligases.

to further validate the proposed degradation pathway, we performed lc-ms analysis of cell extracts of arthrobacter sp. rue61a, cultivated on different carbon sources . in extracts of anthranilate-grown cells, a total of  <dig> different coa esters were identified, including anthraniloyl-coa. besides, coa esters of acids with the empirical formula c7h7no <dig> and c7h8o <dig> were exclusively detected in extracts of anthranilate-grown cells. the coa thioester of the c7h7no <dig> acid presumably corresponds to hydroxyanthraniloyl-coa. interestingly, 5-hydroxyanthraniloyl-coa was reported to be formed in the reaction catalyzed by 2-aminobenzoyl-coa monooxygenase/reductase under nadh-limiting conditions
 <cit> . the coa thioester of c7h8o <dig> might correspond to cyclohexanedione-carboxyl-coa. cyclohexanedione was previously observed as product of the hydrolytic deamination and acidic decarboxylation of 2-amino-5-oxocyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-coa, which is the main product of the enzymatic reaction when nadh is not limiting
 <cit> . 2-amino-5-oxocyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-coa is unstable at ph <5
 <cit> ; consistently, it could not be detected in the cell extracts.

unexpectedly, anthraniloyl-coa was not detected in extracts of 1 h-4-oxoquinaldine-grown cells . however, the extracts contained a metabolite with the molecular formula of phenylacetyl-coa, tentatively suggesting that a phenylacetate coa ligase  is upregulated under these growth conditions. if so, induction of paak  expression could be due to cross-regulation by transcriptional regulators encoded by arue_113p <dig> and arue_113p <dig>  which both are related to the paax repressor of the phenylacetate catabolon, and which are involved in transcriptional control of quinaldine degradation .

since catechol was previously observed to occur during quinaldine degradation
 <cit> , we had discussed the presence of an alternative pathway of anthranilate degradation via catechol
 <cit> . however, searching the genome for possible anthranilate  <dig> -dioxygenase genes was inconclusive. unexpectedly, catechol itself did not support growth, but was subject to slow cometabolic conversion by resting cells, presumably due to low activity of protocatechuate  <dig> -dioxygenase towards catechol . the metabolite which accumulated in the culture media showed an intense absorption band at 258 nm, suggesting formation of ciscis-muconate
 <cit> . since neither catechol nor monohydroxy-substituted anthranilates supported growth of strain rue61a , the metabolism of anthranilate appears to exclusively follow a coa-thioester pathway.

growth of arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a on glucose-containing mineral medium supplemented with benzoate resulted in the presence of benzoyl-coa in cell extracts , which might be formed by the arue_c <dig> and/or arue_113p <dig> proteins, however, benzoate did not support growth. the strain also does not grow on salicylate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, or gentisate. in contrast, 4-hydroxybenzoate was readily utilized , presumably via hydroxylation to protocatechuate by poba monooxygenase and subsequent mineralization via the ortho ring-cleavage pathway encoded by the pca gene cluster. vanillate most probably is converted to protocatechuate by a vanillate o-demethylase prior to mineralization via ortho cleavage . in contrast, a meta cleavage pathway can be proposed for the degradation of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and homoprotocatechuate . interestingly, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate is an intermediate of a tyrosine degradation pathway found in several gram-positive bacteria
 <cit> . while tyrosine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate supported growth of strain rue61a , phenylacetate did not, but underwent rapid cometabolic conversion to an unknown metabolite. a gene cluster comprising potential paa genes is formed by arue_c33590– <dig>  the deduced gene products of arue_c33590– <dig> share between 68% and 87% sequence identity with the paabkjihg proteins of a. oxydans cect386
 <cit> , which presumably represent an oxepin-coa-forming ring  <dig> -epoxyphenylacetyl-coa isomerase , and the five components of a ring  <dig> -phenylacetyl-coa epoxidase 
 <cit> . the putative phenylacetate coa ligase  encoded by arue_c <dig> shows 86% identity to paaf of a. oxydans, and arue_c <dig> is presumed to code for a thioesterase . the apparently incomplete set of paa genes is consistent with the finding that phenylacetate is transformed without being degraded. styrene also was not utilized, but cometabolically converted , possibly by the gene products of arue_c <dig> and arue_c <dig>  which show 53% and 67% identity to the self-sufficient styrene monooxygenase stya2b and the associated stya <dig> protein, respectively, of rhodococcus opacus strain 1cp
 <cit> . taken together, strain rue61a apparently has a quite narrow set of aromatic degradation pathways, which mainly enable the utilization of 4-hydroxy-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. compounds like vanillate and 4-hydroxybenzoate are characteristic products of lignin depolymerization, suggesting that strain rue61a has adapted to utilize the low molecular weight aromatic compounds produced by ligninolytic microorganisms.

carbohydrates and carboxylic acids
arthrobacter sp. rue61a is able to utilize a number of monosaccharides, the disaccharides sucrose, lactose, trehalose and maltose, as well as glucosamine and n-acetylglucosamine. trehalose probably is isomerized to maltose by tres. a gene for maltose phosphorylase could not be identified, however, a putative alpha-glucan phosphorylase gene is located closely to one of the tres genes. starch is utilized, consistent with the prediction of a secreted alpha-amylase , but other polysaccharides tested were not hydrolyzed . the central pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, pentose phosphate cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenesis, were identified in the genome. the gene encoding the anaplerotic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is also present . genes coding for isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, the key enzymes of the anaplerotic glyoxylate cycle, were also identified. consistent with the predicted glyoxylate cycle proteins, acetate and glyoxylate were readily used as carbon sources. however, utilization of glyoxylate may proceed mainly via the d-glycerate pathway . 2-chloroacetate as well as glycolate, which would result from hydrolytic dechlorination of chloroacetate, did not support growth .

proteins, lipids, and alcohols
arthrobacter strain rue61a grows on skim milk agar plates and produces zones of clearing around the colonies, indicating extracellular proteolytic activity. several genes for putative secreted proteases are present in the genome. utilization or cometabolic hydrolysis of the triacylglyceride tributyrin was not observed, but the monoacylglyceride 1-oleyl-rac-glycerol supported growth of arthrobacter sp. rue61a. the genome contains several genes coding for putative lipases/esterases of the α/β-hydrolase fold-superfamily or the sgnh-superfamily, however, signal peptides were not predicted for these proteins. growth on glycerol probably involves the activity of glycerol kinase  and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  encoded by arue_c <dig> and arue_c <dig>  respectively, to form dihydroxyacetone phosphate. the arue_c <dig> gene within this cluster codes for a putative glycerol uptake facilitator protein. the arue_c <dig> locus codes for another glpd protein. whereas the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glpd is an nad-independent flavoenzyme that passes electrons to the respiratory chain, gpsa-type glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, presumably represented by arue_c <dig>  depends on nad+.

the genome of arthrobacter strain rue61a contains several genes of putative alcohol dehydrogenases and aldehyde dehydrogenases/oxidases, but since the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by arue_c <dig> shares 74% identity with acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ii of cupriavidus necator  h16
 <cit> , ethanol utilization by strain rue61a likely involves this protein.

amines and other nitrogen compounds
among the amine compounds tested as sources of carbon and energy and as nitrogen sources, creatinine was not utilized, but creatine and sarcosine supported growth of arthrobacter sp. rue61a . creatine degradation involves hydrolysis to sarcosine  and urea by creatinase, followed by oxidation of sarcosine to formaldehyde and glycine. the gene arrangement of arue_c39610– <dig> corresponds to that of gene clusters of corynebacterium sp. u- <dig> and arthrobacter spp. coding for serine hydroxymethyltransferase , tetrameric sarcosine oxidase , serine dehydratase , and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate deformylase 
 <cit> , suggesting that sarcosine catabolism in arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a proceeds via glycine and serine to pyruvate . in corynebacterium sp., the tetrameric sarcosine oxidase is the catabolic enzyme that is induced during growth on sarcosine
 <cit> .

arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a also grows on choline. as mentioned above, choline presumably is a source for synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine, but its utilization as carbon source probably also proceeds via glycine betaine . the protein encoded by arue_c <dig>  which shows 87% identity to n,n-dimethylglycine oxidase of arthrobacter globiformis , is a likely candidate for the enzyme catalyzing n,n-dimethylglycine conversion to sarcosine.

agmatine seems to be utilized via the agmatine deiminase  pathway, which involves hydrolysis of agmatine to ammonia and carbamoylputrescine by agua and another hydrolytic step to putrescine, catalyzed by n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase agub. putrescine degradation follows oxidative deamination to 4-aminobutanal, presumably catalyzed by the arue_c <dig> protein, which shares 76% identity with putrescine oxidase of rhodococcus erythropolis . oxidation of 4-aminobutanal by γ-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase produces 4-aminobutyrate, which in a transamination reaction is converted to succinic semialdehyde. oxidation by succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase finally yields succinic .

hypoxanthine and xanthine utilization by arthobacter sp. strain rue61a is initiated by oxidation to urate. the reaction is catalyzed by xanthine dehydrogenase or -oxidase, a molybdenum hydroxylase encoded by arue_c35300– <dig>  urate degradation probably involves urate oxidase and 5-hydroxyisourate hydrolase. the next step, catalyzed by ohcu decarboxylase, produces -allantoin . allantoin indeed supports growth of arthrobacter sp. rue61a and also can serve as sole nitrogen source. its degradation likely occurs via glyoxylate . a putative allantoinase gene is located adjacent to the genes coding for glyoxylate utilization via the glycerate pathway , however, candidate genes for allantoate conversion to urea and glyoxylate, or to ammonia, carbon dioxide, urea and glyoxylate, were not obvious. two pathways seem to be present for the degradation of urea, namely, direct cleavage by urease , and an allophanate pathway which involves the atp-dependent carboxylation to urea-1-carboxylate  catalyzed by urea carboxylase, followed by hydrolysis to co <dig> and ammonia by allophanate hydrolase . the latter pathway may be involved in the assimilation of urea as nitrogen source
 <cit> .

taurine
arthrobacter sp. strain rue61a is unable to grow with taurine  as sole carbon source or as sole source of nitrogen, but taurine supports growth when supplemented as sole sulfur source . a putative taurine dioxygenase , which generates aminoacetaldehyde and sulfite, is encoded by arue_c31570; genes of a putative tauabc-like sulfonate transporter are located adjacently. another possible taud gene may be represented by arue_c <dig>  genes of an alternative taurine degradation pathway via sulfo acetaldehyde and acetylphosphate were not identified in the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of arthrobacter sp. rue61a contains a high number of genes coding for transporters presumably involved in the uptake of nutrients, and many genes coding for the utilization of carbohydrates, aromatic compounds deriving from lignin, and organic nitrogen compounds, consistent with the saprophytic lifestyle of the organism. its nutritional versatility gives strain rue61a a competitive advantage in soil environments. genome analysis also suggests a strong adaptive potential to osmotic and oxidative stress, which presumably is the key to the environmental robustness of the genus. the genomes of strain rue61a and of a. aurescens tc <dig> show a high overall similarity, and both strains are highly resistant to pb2+ and arsenate. however, the two strains as well as the other environmental arthrobacter strains whose genomes have been sequenced significantly differ in their biodegradative capabilities, presumably reflecting the adaptation of coexisting soil bacteria to distinct nutritional niches.
