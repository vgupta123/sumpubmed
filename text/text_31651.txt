BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in protein degradation and many biological processes such as transcription, cell cycle progression, antigen processing, cellular defense, signaling, and apoptosis  <cit> . in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme  activates ubiquitin  by attaching it to a substrate via a thiol-ester linkage and then transferring the complex formed to the active-site cysteine of a ubiquitin carrier protein . formation of isopeptide bonds between the c terminus of ub and the lysines on the substrate is catalyzed by a ubiquitin ligase , which binds the substrate and catalyzes the transfer of ub from a specific e <dig> to the substrate. the formation of a chain of ub molecules on the substrate generally targets it for degradation by the  <dig> s proteasome  <cit> . comparative genome analysis has revealed the presence of a few genes encoding e <dig>  others encoding e <dig>  and hundreds encoding e <dig> ligases  <cit> .

ring finger proteins contain a ring finger domain, which was first identified as being encoded by the really interesting new gene in the early  <dig> s  <cit> . the ring finger domain contains  <dig> metal-binding residues that coordinate  <dig> zinc atoms in an interleaved pattern to facilitate correct folding, which is necessary for the biological actions of these proteins. many ring finger proteins have been identified as ubiquitin ligases and are known to play an important role in various physiological processes. for example, mdm <dig>  a representative ring finger protein, is a ubiquitin ligase of p <dig>  <cit> . further, cbl is known to play an important role in the ligand-induced ubiquitination of epidermal growth factor receptor  via a mechanism that involves interaction between the ring finger domain and ubch <dig>  <cit> . the tumor necrosis factor  receptor associated factors  contain a ring finger domain at the n-terminal region; tnfs play an important role in both adaptive and innate immunity  <cit> . however, there are still hundreds of ring finger proteins whose functions have yet to be characterized.

a cell-based screening performed in our laboratory revealed that the rnf <dig> gene is associated with cell viability  <cit> . rnf <dig> is expressed in several normal tissues and in tumor tissues and cell lines; rnf <dig> has been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum  and the golgi apparatus  <cit> . comparative genomic hybridization  has revealed that rnf <dig> is overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells  <cit> . however, rnf <dig> expression is not invariably detected in mammalian and escherichia coli cells. the presence of the ring finger domain in rnf <dig> implies that rnf <dig> may be involved in the ubiquitylation pathway; however, to date, there has been no study that has sought to biochemically characterize of rnf <dig>  moreover, the mechanism of apoptosis induction mediated by rnf <dig> remains unclear. given the importance of the biological functions of the ring finger proteins and the overexpression of rnf <dig> in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, a functional characterization of this gene is highly warranted. the present study provides evidence that rnf <dig> is a new uncharacterized ubiquitin ligase. further, we demonstrate that rnf <dig> interacts with caml.

RESULTS
characterization of rnf <dig> expression in mammalian cells and e. coli
yu found that epitope-tagged rnf <dig> was not successfully expressed in mammalian and bacterial cells  <cit> . in the present study, we performed similar experiments and obtained the same results. however, northern blotting, rt-pcr, and subcellular localization studies have demonstrated the existence of rnf <dig>  <cit> . many ring finger proteins are ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate themselves to facilitate their degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome. we accordingly examined the expression of rnf <dig> in hela and hek293t cells after treatment with one of the ubiquitin proteasome inhibitors, namely, mg <dig>  as illustrated in figure 1a, rnf <dig> was detected in the mg132-treated cells. this result demonstrates that rnf <dig> is a substrate of the ubiquitin proteasome system. to verify the importance of the ring finger domain in the stability of rnf <dig>  a mutant rnf <dig> gene was constructed using pcr-based mutagenesis and transfected into hek293t cells. subsequently, the total protein was extracted and analyzed by western blotting. the mutant rnf <dig> was detected in cells not treated with mg132; further, its expression was not significantly affected by mg <dig> treatment . these results suggest that the ring finger domain is critical for the degradation of rnf <dig>  figure 1a and 1b shows  <dig> bands of approximately  <dig> kd and  <dig> kd, indicating that rnf <dig> may be glycosylated; this result is consistent with the fact that the rnf <dig> sequence contains some potential n-linked glycosylation sites . moreover, treatment of the cells with tunicamycin, which inhibits n-linked glycosylation, caused a shift in the protein bands . these results indicate that rnf <dig> is an n-linked glycosylated protein containing a ring finger that catalyses its own degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner.

we constructed a full-length gst-rnf <dig> fusion protein, but we were unable to demonstrate successful expression of this protein in bacteria , which is consistent with the results obtained by yu  <cit> . the transmembrane sites, usually represented by a hydrophobic sequence, are not expressed in e. coli. hence, we constructed two truncated mutants of gst-rnf <dig>  namely, gst-rnf122Δtm and gst-mutrnf122Δtm, in which the transmembrane  domain was deleted. as illustrated in figure 1c, the expression of both gst-rnf122Δtm and gst-mutrnf122Δtm was inducible. these proteins were purified successfully by affinity chromatography and confirmed by western blotting using an anti-gst antibody.

in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination of rnf122
to further examine the ubiquitination of rnf <dig>  we performed in vivo ubiquitination studies. we coexpressed rnf122-myc with ha-ubiquitin in hek293t cells, recovered the immunoprecipitates using anti-myc antibody, and performed immunoblotting using the anti-ha antibody. as shown in figure 2a, a smeared band, which indicates ubiquitination, appeared in the blots of lysates of cells cotransfected with rnf122-myc and ha-ubiquitin, but this was not detected in the vector control group. hence, we confirmed that rnf <dig> undergoes ubiquitination in vivo. further, we performed the same experiment using an rnf <dig> mutated in the ring finger domain and found that this mutant  was also ubiquitylated in vivo, as evident from the high-molecular-weight smeared band detected on blots of the lysates of the cells coexpressing rnf122c92a-myc and ubiquitin . however, the degree of ubiquitination of this mutant protein was significantly lower than that of rnf122-myc; a finding that is consistent with the proteasome degradation of the wild-type and mutant rnf <dig> 

the presence of the ring finger domain in rnf <dig> confers the properties of a ubiquitin ligase to this protein. to investigate whether rnf <dig> has ubiquitin ligase activity, we established an in vitro autoubiquitination assay, which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, e <dig>  e <dig>  and bacterially expressed gst-rnf122Δtm were added to a reaction mixture containing ubiquitin and atp. we treated the rnf <dig> fusion proteins with different e <dig> enzymes to determine which e <dig> supports rnf122-mediated ubiquitination. as is evident from figure 2b, polyubiquitination was detected only in cells treated with the following e2-conjugating enzymes: ubch5a, ubch5b, ubch5c, ubc <dig>  and ubc <dig>  to clarify the role of the ring finger domain in ubiquitination, we performed an auto ubiquitination assay using rnf <dig> containing a single-site mutations  in the ring finger domain . as shown in figure 2c, the mutation compromised the autoubiquitylation activity of ubch5a, ubch5b, ubch5c, ubc <dig>  and ubc <dig>  these results demonstrate that rnf <dig> is an e <dig> ligase that is selective for ubch5a, ubch5b, ubch5c, ubc <dig>  and ubc <dig> 

rnf <dig> interacts with caml
next, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify the potential substrates of rnf <dig>  the experiments were performed by ruixing corp. . the results revealed that rnf <dig> interacts with caml, a protein associated with calcium signaling and t cell activation. to confirm the interaction between rnf <dig> and caml, we co-expressed these proteins in hek293t cells and immunoprecipitated rnf122-myc with the anti-myc antibody. western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate obtained using the anti-flag antibody revealed that rnf <dig> but not its mutant form was coprecipitated with flag-tagged caml , demonstrating their association in mammalian cells . the results also suggested that caml interacts with rnf <dig> through the ring finger domain. hence, the ring finger protein functions as a ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinylates the substrate and targets it to the ubiquitin proteasome system. we accordingly performed experiments to determine whether caml is a substrate of rnf <dig> and whether it can be degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system. as shown in figure 3b, however, caml levels in mg132-treated cells were not elevated, suggesting that caml may not be involved in the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. furthermore, caml protein levels remained unchanged even when caml-flag and rnf122-myc or mutant rnf <dig> were coexpressed . overall, we conclude that caml interacts with rnf <dig> but is not a substrate for its ubiquitylating activity. interestingly, rnf <dig> expression was occasionally detected in cells that overexpressed caml. as illustrated in figure 3d, rnf <dig> was stabilized when caml was overexpressed. hence, it can be speculated that the interaction between caml and rnf <dig> inhibits the ubiquitination of rnf <dig>  and thereby stabilizes rnf <dig> 

colocalization of rnf <dig> and caml in hek293t and hela cells
in order to confirm the intracellular interaction between rnf <dig> and caml, we constructed a plasmid, namely, pegfp-n1-rnf <dig>  encoding green fluorescent protein, and a caml-flag-encoding plasmid and cotransfected these into hela cells or hek293t cells. as shown in figure 4a, both pegfp-n1-rnf <dig> and caml-flag were observed to be localized in the cytoplasm and were highly concentrated in spots around the nucleus; moreover, the distribution of caml was similar to that of rnf <dig>  further experiments on the localization of caml yielded the same result, namely, that caml is partially localized to the er. this observation is consistent with our previous finding that rnf <dig> is localized to the er. these data confirmed that rnf <dig> and caml interact to form a complex that is functional in the cytoplasm.

the tm domain is critical to the localization of rnf122
rnf <dig> contains a putative tm domain near the n terminus . to investigate whether this domain is required for the localization of rnf <dig> to the er, we generated a truncated mutant of rnf <dig> in which  <dig> n-terminal amino acids were deleted. the expression vectors pcdb/rnf122-Δtm and rnf122-Δtm-gfp were constructed and used to evaluate the functions and subcellular localization of the truncated rnf <dig>  the cytoplasmic expression pattern of the rnf <dig> mutant was noted to be diffuse as compared to the expression pattern of the wild-type rnf <dig> , indicating that the n-terminal tm domain of rnf <dig> is required for its specific localization. these findings suggest that the putative n-terminal tm domain is necessary for the localization of rnf <dig> 

discussion
the importance of the ring finger domain in ubiquitination is supported by the fact that several ring finger proteins are associated with ubcs and/or specific proteins destined for proteasome-dependent degradation, although there have been no reports confirming their e <dig> activities toward these proteins.

in our previous study, we performed northern blotting and rt-pcr analysis, and confirmed that rnf <dig> is widely expressed in several tissues and cell lines and that it is localized to the er and the golgi apparatus. a cell-based screening test revealed that rnf <dig> can downregulate the expression of the prolactin  gene. further studies showed that rnf <dig> was associated with the viability of hek293t cells. however, the exact biological function of rnf <dig> is still unknown. in the present study, we characterized the biological role of rnf <dig>  rnf <dig> contains a ring domain, which suggests that it catalyzes its own degradation. furthermore, through in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays, rnf <dig> was identified as a new ubiquitin ligase. we also found that the tm domain of rnf <dig> is critical for its localization to the er.

caml is a ubiquitous protein containing  <dig> amino acids. it contains  <dig> putative tm domains near its c terminus and has been shown to be a resident protein of the er  <cit> . there are several proteins that can interact with caml, including caml interactor   <cit> , epidermal growth factor receptor   <cit> , p56lck  <cit> , kaposi's sarcoma virus-associated mitochondrial k <dig> protein  <cit> , type- <dig> angiotensin ii receptor-associated protein   <cit> , and γ <dig> subunit-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid type a receptor   <cit> . consistent with the findings of the previous studies on caml, our findings showed that rnf <dig> interacts with caml. the coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments verified the interaction between rnf <dig> and caml in mammalian cells and, at the same time, showed that overexpression of rnf <dig> does not reduce the caml levels. nonetheless, it seems unlikely that caml is a substrate for the ubiquitin ligase activity of rnf <dig>  this supposition is based on the observation that caml levels were not reduced by the coexpression of rnf <dig> and were not increased in mg132-treated cells.

we have validated the interaction between caml and rnf <dig> in vivo when the proteins are overexpressed, which may not necessarily represent the endogenous condition. however, we have failed to testify endogenous interaction because of the limited rnf <dig> expression and its poor antibody. in the stability study, rnf <dig> can be stabilized when caml was overexpressed, which give a clue that rnf <dig> and caml are functional related. it has been concluded that caml has been proposed to regulate trafficking of egfr and the gabaa receptor. the stalibility of egfr and gabaa receptor can be modulated through c-cbl and plic- <dig> respectively, and they both are involved in ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . so we speculate that rnf <dig> may regulate egfr and gabaa receptor stability through ubiquitin-proteasome system. we are still focus on the biological role of rnf <dig> in the next investigation. the results may give us a new direction to clarify the biological function of rnf <dig> 

previous study show that caml can interact with egfr in ligand-dependent way, which gave us a clue that rnf <dig> may involved in egfr pathway. we have also found that rnf <dig> effect on cell viability may relate to erk pathway . however, the precise molecular mechanisms such as the interaction between egfr and rnf <dig> still need to be further explored.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, rnf <dig> can be characterized as a c3h2c3-type ring finger-containing e <dig> ubiquitin ligase localized to the er. rnf <dig> promotes its own degradation in ring finger-and proteasome-dependent manner. rnf <dig> interacts with caml, and its e <dig> ubiquitin ligase activity was noted to be dependent on the ring finger domain. further studies are required to clarify the molecular mechanism, such as substrate binding, that underlie rnf <dig> action.
