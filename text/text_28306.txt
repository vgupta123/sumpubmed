BACKGROUND
the completion of a draft genome assembly simply marks the “end of the beginning” of genome exploration in that species  <cit> . after a genome is sequenced, the next critical step is gene annotation. this includes marking the genomic position and structure of genes, naming genes  and functional annotation i.e. identifying their biological function. since the sequencing of the cattle genome in  <dig>  <cit> , there have been efforts to identify functional elements in the genome . functional genomics focuses on understanding the function and regulation of genes and gene products on a genome-wide or global scale  <cit> . initial annotation of the cattle genome identified  <dig> + genes, with a core set of  <dig>  orthologs shared among seven mammalian species  <cit> . despite these efforts, the function of some genes is still not understood, or partly understood at best  <cit> .

the large amount of biological data deposited in public databases provides an opportunity to computationally annotate functional and regulatory connections among genes. a challenge in this post-genomic era is to properly integrate available information so as to reconstruct, as accurately as possible, valuable information from large volumes of data  <cit> . it is widely accepted that to understand gene function, genes must be studied in the context of networks  <cit> . gene co-expression analysis  has emerged as a powerful systems biology approach for multigene analysis of large-scale data sets with functional annotation  . this technique has been widely used to functionally annotate gene from different species . an output of gca is the ability to annotate gene function based on ‘guilt-by-association’ . in short, groups of genes that maintain a consistent expression relationship  may share a common biological role  <cit> . the evolutionary conservation of co-expression patterns lends further evidence to support the biological importance of this phenomenon  <cit> .

in this study, a condition independent gene co-expression network was generated to provide additional functional annotation information for genes in the cattle genome. we have annotated genes with possible putative functions and possible regulatory mechanisms. this effort will accelerate discovery of genes and lead to elucidation of the biological features responsible for economic traits. network information is publically available at http://www.animalgenome.org/cgi-bin/host/reecylab/d.

RESULTS
data from  <dig> experiments , which equated to  <dig> publically available affymetrix genechip bovine genome arrays, was used to construct a cattle condition-free gene co-expression network . these experiments covered  <dig> tissues and four broadly classified experimental conditions . only probe sets that mapped to unique enterz gene id’s  were used for gene network construction . weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit>  was used to identify highly connected gene sets  based on their normalized expression levels . sixty percent , of probe sets were consolidated into  <dig> modules . the approximate high scale-free topology fitting index  shows approximate scale free topology in cgcn .fig.  <dig> composition of the  <dig> affymetrix genechip bovine genome arrays used in this study. arrays were classified according to the experimental conditions  and distribution

since genes belonging to the same module are co-expressed across a vast array of tissues and experimental conditions, they are likely to encode proteins with related functions or are within a given pathway  <cit> . the potential biological function of the identified modules were investigated using gene ontology  <cit>  and reactome pathway information  <cit>  . almost all modules exhibited high enrichment for go terms  or reactome pathways  . the concordance between enriched go terms and pathways in each module strengthened the biological function of computational modules. the biological function of modules in cgcn can be categorized into four major functional categories  . in each module, there were several tight clusters of go terms that had many links between these groups of genes , which may represent robust interactions between these processes.table  <dig> modules identified in the network and their top over-represented biological process go terms

the molecular function  go terms of the genes included in this module were related to regulation of gene expression such as: single-stranded rna binding, double-stranded rna binding, nad+ adp-ribosyltransferase activity and exonuclease activity, active with either ribo- or deoxyribonucleic acids and producing 5′-phosphomonoesters . in addition, this module was highly over-represented for reactome  <cit>  pathways related to rig-i/mda <dig> mediated induction of ifn-alpha/beta pathways, interferon signaling and cytosolic sensors of pathogen-associated dna were over-represented .

the saddle brown module had  <dig> probe sets, which mapped to  <dig> genes, and contained  <dig> edges. forty two percent of these genes  had high interaction scores , which highlights the functional connection between genes in this module. this module exhibited several clusters of over-represented bp go terms related to: defense response to bacterium , regulation of inflammatory response , leukocyte chemotaxis , inflammatory response , inflammatory response to antigenic stimulus , and leukocyte migration . the top over-represented bp go term in the module was defense response to bacterium  and close similarity between this term and the other over-represented go terms in the module  indicate response to bacterium as the main biological function of this module.

enriched mf go terms associated with this module were related to cell signaling such as: cytokine activity, non-membrane spanning protein tyrosine kinase activity and rage receptor binding . in accordance with these results, this module was highly over-represented for cell surface interactions at the vascular wall as its reactome pathway .

the light green module contained  <dig> probe sets, which mapped to  <dig> genes that were connected via  <dig>  edges. thirty nine percent of these genes,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, had high protein interaction scores . this module had over-represented bp go terms related to energy metabolism such as: purine ribonucleoside triphosphate metabolic process , generation of precursor metabolites and energy  and cristae formation  . enriched mf go terms associated with this module was related to hydrogen ion transmembrane transporter activity and inorganic cation transmembrane transporter activity . this module was over-represented for the following rectome pathway terms: citric acid cycle  and respiratory electron transport, glycolysis, metabolism of nucleotides, processive synthesis on the c-strand of the telomere and tp <dig> regulates metabolic genes .

the red module contained  <dig> probe sets, which mapped to  <dig> genes, and had  <dig>  edges. just less than half of these genes,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes, had high protein interaction scores   that highlight the functional connection between genes in the module. gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed cell-cycle as the top over-represented bp go term in the module. close similarity between this term and more than 80 % of over-represented bp go terms in the module  indicated that cell-cycle was an umbrella process for this module . molecular function go terms for this module were related to atp binding, dna binding, damaged dna binding, dna helicase activity and cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase regulator activity . this module also displayed a high number of over-represented reactome pathways related to cell cycle such as chromosome maintenance, mitotic g2-g2/m phases, activation of the pre-replicative complex and mitotic prophase .

the potential function of  <dig> genes with no previous functional annotation, e.g. no associated/assigned go terms, was predicted based on functional uniformity among the associated genes . interestingly, we found four intra-modular hub genes with un-known function: loc <dig>  loc <dig>  loc <dig> and mgc <dig> which were located in the light cyan, yellow, blue and brown modules, respectively. functional analysis of their located module and close interconnectedness  >  <dig> ) with known genes  revealed that they are potentially involved in biological functions related to leukocyte activation , rna processing , nucleic acid metabolic process  and organic-acid metabolic process . such highly connected genes should be investigated more closely as they likely to have key regulatory roles in the cattle.table  <dig> functional enrichment analysis of close neighbors  of hub genes with no functional annotation in cgcna

discussion
gene annotation projects indicate that some protein coding genes in a variety of organisms have no known functionally or have weak functional annotation  <cit> . defining the functions of all genes in the genome of an organism is a formidable task. gene expression data is a valuable resource that can provide possible functional annotation of a gene. each gene is estimated on average to interact with four to eight other genes and to be involved in  <dig> biological functions  <cit> . gene co-expression analysis provides a framework to study gene function in the context of interactions derived from multiple data sources and integrated into a global interactome. with emphasis on cattle the application of rna-sequencing has paved the way for transcriptome analysis of cattle in recent years in various experimental conditions . for the purpose of genome-wide co-expression analyses, a comprehensive catalogue of experimental conditions from rna-seq studies is still incomplete. nevertheless, historical microarray data have provided a basis for genome-wide co-expression studies in cattle. in this study, cattle condition independent gene co-expression networks were generated using the large number of publicly available high-quality microarray chips from either ncbi geo  <cit>  or ebi arrayexpress  <cit> . the hypothesis of this study was that genes with similar pattern of accumulation across a vast array of tissues and experimental conditions are likely to encode proteins with related functions  <cit> . the first attempt to construct a genome wide gene co-expression network has been made by lee et al.  <cit> . they presented a large-scale analysis of mrna co-expression based on  <dig> large human data sets and explained how the large body of accumulated microarray data can be exploited to increase the reliability of inferences about gene function. since then, several attempts have been made to construct massive scale gene co-expression network as a source of functional annotation in many species from yeast to human .

wgcna  <cit> , a powerful ‘guilt-by-association’-based method, was used to construct cgcn. several measures can be used to define correlation coefficient in correlation networks such as pearson correlation, spearman correlation and biweight midcorrelation  <cit> . the pearson correlation is sensitive to outlying observations and it just considers the linear relations between variables. while spearman correlations protect against outliers and can account for non-linear relations. it is however overly conservative in many applications  <cit> . in this study, we used biweight midcorrelation for network construction which combines the advantages of both the pearson  and spearman correlations   <cit> .

wgcna is based on the concept of a scale-free network. metabolic networks in all organisms have been suggested to be scale-free networks  <cit> , and scale-free network phenomena have been observed in many empirical studies . scale-free networks are extremely heterogeneous, and their topology being dominated by a few highly connected nodes that link the rest of the less connected nodes to the system  <cit> . the main property of scale-free networks is their remarkable tolerance against attacks of randomly selected nodes but not against directed removals of central nodes   <cit> . these hub nodes can be detected using nodes connectivity in the whole network  or in the subnetworks of the main network   <cit> . intra-modularconnectivity has been found to be an important complementary node screening variable for finding biologically important genes  <cit> . they argued that while whole-network connectivity is important in many context, nodes important for particular functions in large, complex networks are often not among the whole-network hubs  <cit> . based on these results, intra-modularconnectivity was used to detected hub genes in cgcn.

constructing a gene co-expression network and naturally partitioning the network into modules, provided a systems-level understanding of the gene modules that coordinate multiple biological processes to carry out specific biological functions  <cit> . the effectiveness of our approach is best illustrated by correspondence of these computational modules with actual biological entities. most of gene interactions found in each module were also supported with protein interaction data  from string database  <cit> .

the white module had several close interconnected over-represented go terms and reactome pathways related to immune response to virus . this module was also enriched for isg15-protein conjugation bp go terms, which were associated with isg <dig>  uba <dig> and ube2l <dig>  isg <dig> ubiquitin-like modifier gene  encodes for an interferon induced ubiquitin like  protein, which plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection either via its conjugation to both host and viral proteins  or via its action as a free or unconjugated protein  <cit> . the isgylation process requires three sequential reaction steps: activation, conjugation and ligation, which are performed by e1-e <dig> enzymes, respectively  <cit> . the other two genes, uba <dig> and ube2l <dig>  encode for ubiquitin/isg <dig> activating and conjugating enzymes, respectively  <cit> . another gene in the module, herc <dig>  has ligase activity and is involved in the ubl conjugation pathway  <cit> . herc <dig> has been reported to be important in the antiviral response  <cit> , where it functions as the main e <dig> ligase for global isg <dig> conjugation in mouse cells  <cit> . the expression change and direct regulation of herc <dig> and interferon-simulated genes  by interferon tau  has been shown in cattle endometrium  <cit> . interferon tau shows antiproliferative effects and antiviral activities that have less toxicity than the other type-i ifns  <cit> . ubiquitin specific peptidase  had the highest intra-modularconnectivity and is the hub node for the white module . this gene has isg15-specific protease activity, i.e. it removes isg <dig> from isgylated proteins  <cit>  as evidenced by its associated mf go term  <cit> . usp <dig> protein highly interacts  with 40 % of the proteins encoded in the white module  . for example, a combined interaction score >  <dig> meant that connection between two proteins ranked in the top  <dig> percentile combined scores in the string database  <cit>  . these results might indicate its close functional relations with the other genes included in the white module. the function of this gene is crucial for proper cellular balance of isg15-conjugated proteins  <cit> . in addition, usp <dig> has a major role in the regulation of signal transduction pathways triggered by type i interferons   <cit> , which play a central role in the antiviral innate immune response of vertebrates  <cit> .

regulation of gene expression is determined in large part by the activity of transcriptional activator proteins. also, transcriptional regulation enables cells to respond to environmental cues such as viral infection  <cit> . two members of interferon regulatory factors  gene family, irf <dig> and irf <dig>  were included in the white module. irfs transcription factors  regulate ifns gene transcription and protein production  <cit>  and have a well-known activity against pathogenic infections in several species  <cit> . in cattle, the antiviral activity of irf <dig> and irf <dig> has been reported to be associated with both bovine herpesvirus <dig>  <cit>  and foot-and-mouth disease virus  <cit>  infection. high connectivity  between the module hub node and these tfs indicate that they are potentially co-regulated. for example, a tom score >  <dig>  meant that connection between two genes ranked in the top  <dig> percentile connectivity across networks .

the saddle brown module was highly enriched for several bp go terms related to response to bacterium . in addition, this module had over-represented mf go terms and reactome pathways related to different aspects of cellular surface interactions involved in immune response . individual cells monitor their surrounding environment and react to extracellular challenges that require adaptation or threaten viability  <cit> . the plasma membrane forms a barrier between a cell and its surroundings and participates in the initial response to biological attack  <cit> . cytokines, important mediators of immune responses, are secreted by immune cells in response to pathogenes, and bind to specific membrane receptors, which then signal the cell via second messengers, often tyrosine kinases, to alter cellular activity, e.g. gene expression  <cit> . four genes with cytokine activity were included in the module: il <dig>  il1b, il1rn and pf <dig>  the antibacterial activity of these well-known genes with the highest quality annotation scoring in the uniprot database  <cit> , have been reported in response to several bacterial infections in cattle . the saddle brown module hub gene, s100a <dig> plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immune response  <cit> . this gene can induce neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion and increase the bactericidal activity of neutrophils by promoting phagocytosis  <cit> . it has antibacterial activity via chelation of zn2+, which is essential for bacterial growth  <cit> . in addition, s100a <dig> acts as an alarmin or a danger associated molecular pattern  and can stimulate innate immune cells via binding to pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptor  <dig>   <cit> .

the light yellow module had several over-represented go terms and reactome pathways related to different aspects of energy metabolism . in addition, this module was highly enriched for cristae formation as bp go term . the unbiased studies on knockout mice revealed that telomere dysfunction is associated with impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production  <cit> . despite the over-representation of the go term, tp <dig> regulates metabolic genes pathway, in the light green module, the tp <dig> gene was not included in the module. this gene was included in the yellow module that showed high enrichment for go terms related to gene expression and rna processing . closer inspection of nine genes in tp <dig> regulates metabolic genes pathway  revealed tight connectivity  between the probe sets that mapped to these genes and tp <dig>  this result indicates that tp <dig> might be an intermediate node between the yellow and light green modules. cox5a gene had the highest connectivity in the module and considered as an intra-modular hub node. this gene encodes for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5a, which is the heme a-containing chain of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal oxidase in mitochondrial electron transport and has a key role in cell energy production  <cit> .

the red module had over-represented go terms and pathways related to cell cycle process . the typical eukaryotic cell cycle is divided into four phases: two gap phases ; a synthesis phase , in which the genetic material is duplicated; and an m phase, in which mitosis partitions the genetic material and the cell divides  <cit> . the regulation of gene expression is an important component of cell cycle control  <cit> . cyclins are one of the main cell cycle regulatory proteins that control the progression of cells through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase  enzymes  <cit> . ten cyclin genes included in the module were: ccna <dig>  ccnb <dig>  ccnb <dig>  ccne <dig>  ccne <dig>  ccnf, cdkn1a, cdkn2c, cks1b and cks <dig>  these genes regulate different cell cycle phases such as g1/s , g2/s , g2/m  and cell division   <cit> . cdca <dig> gene had the highest connectivity in the red module and considered as the intra-modular hub node . this gene is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex , a complex that acts as a key regulator of mitosis  <cit> . the cpc complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly  <cit> .

the fact that functionally related genes are connected together in co-expression networks provides evidence for prediction of the cellular roles for hypothetical genes based on a gba principle  <cit> . neighborhood  analysis based on tom can be used as a powerful tool for this purpose. briefly, two genes have a high topological overlap if they connect and disconnect the same genes. the potential cellular roles of  <dig> functionally unknown cattle genes including four unknown hub genes were predicted using neighborhood analysis  based on gba principle. there were weak sequence similarities between these potential genes and known genes in orthologous species. the results of this study might be used as a new insight for possible biological function of these potential genes.

genes with little to no associated functional information generally have no gene symbol and so are automatically assigned an identifier such as loc <dig>  gene nomenclature, i.e. the scientific naming of genes, tries to standardized representation of genes within an organism, but not necessarily between organisms, based on the biological process or pathway in which they are involved. although the results of the current study cannot be used directly for nomenclature purposes as they have no supporting biological information, they provide a rich resource for experimental biologists to begin to define the real biological function and thereby helping to assign gene symbols to such genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these analyses indicate that the cattle gene co-expression network and corresponding regulons provides rich information for experimental biologists to design experiments, interpret experimental results, and develop novel hypotheses on gene function in cattle. combinatorial approaches that integrate multiple omics findings will provide an important resource that should lead to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying traits of interest in cattle.
