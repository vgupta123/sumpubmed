BACKGROUND
cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by toxigenic vibrio cholerae. the two most important serogroups are o <dig> and o <dig>  which can cause periodic outbreaks reaching epidemic or pandemic proportions  <cit> . however, non-o1/non-o <dig> serogroups have been linked with cholera-like-illness sporadically  <cit> . symptoms may range from mild gastroenteritis to violent diarrhoea, similar to those elicited by the o <dig> toxigenic strains  <cit> . however, patients generally suffer a less severe form of the disease than those infected by o <dig> toxigenic strains  <cit> . non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae strains have also caused localised outbreaks in many countries, including india and thailand  <cit> . more recently, an o <dig> v. cholerae outbreak associated with the consumption of oysters was reported in the usa  <cit> .

non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae strains are frequently isolated from the environment, particularly from seafood and aquatic sources  <cit> . non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae strains are highly heterogeneous with considerable serological diversity and vary in virulence properties. the presence of virulence genes amongst some environmental strains is significant, and environmental strains constitute a reservoir of potential pathogenic strains to human diarrhoeal infections  <cit> . some non-o1/non-o <dig> strains carry key virulence genes, such as cholera toxin  and toxin co-regulated pili , which are usually carried by epidemic strains  <cit> . some may also carry other virulence factors such as the repeat-like toxin  - a cytotoxin and the heat-stable enterotoxin   <cit> . a novel type iii secretion system  was found in some non-o1/non-o <dig> strains and appears to be an important virulence factor  <cit> . the t3ss translocates a number of t3ss effectors into the host cell which interfere with host cell signalling  <cit> . shin et al. <cit>  showed that t3ss is an essential virulence factor for the non-o1/non-o <dig> strain am- <dig> 

in this study,  <dig> non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates from hospitalised diarrhoeal patients in zhejiang province, china were analysed using multilocus sequence typing  and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  to determine their overall genetic relatedness. the presence of key virulence genes including enterotoxins, tcp and t3ss was also analysed.

RESULTS
isolation of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates from diarrhoeal patients in zhejiang, china
a total of  <dig> non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates was retrieved from different cities in zhejiang province, china, over a period of six years from  <dig> to  <dig> . nine isolates were from sporadic cases from seven cities, while  <dig> isolates were obtained from three outbreaks in three different cities: outbreak a in ningbo in  <dig>  outbreak b in lishui in  <dig> and outbreak c in quzhou in  <dig>  the three outbreaks were notified as food poisoning events and were investigated. outbreak a involved  <dig> cases with symptoms ranging from cholera-like diarrhoea to mild diarrhoea and was initially suspected to be a cholera outbreak. non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae was isolated from nine patients. the outbreak occurred in a factory canteen and the food source of the outbreak could not be identified. outbreak b involved eight cases, all having cholera-like symptoms. non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae was isolated from all but one patient. the source of the outbreak was traced to cross contamination of a cold dish from raw cuttlefish. outbreak c occurred in a family function involving  <dig> cases with non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolated from nine cases. the source of the outbreak was shrimp.

‡ the isolate was unable to be typed by pfge.

*two primer pairs of tcpa  were used. both were negative.

nine other non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates were obtained during an active surveillance of enteric bacterial pathogens conducted by zhejiang provincial cdc in two provincial hospitals in hangzhou between may and december in  <dig>  these nine cases of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae infections were identified from a total of  <dig> diarrhoeal stool samples screened. all samples were screened for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic vibrio spp., pathogenic e. coli, aeromonas hydrophila, plesiomonas shigelloides, rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus. there were no other enteric pathogens isolated from these nine cases. this data gave a non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae infection rate of  <dig>  per  <dig> diarrhoeal patients. thus, non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae is an important pathogen in this population and has been neglected as a pathogen generally.

the prevalence of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae in clinical samples varied in other countries. in thailand, the proportion of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolated from diarrhoeal patients was between  <dig>  and  <dig> %  <cit> , which is comparable to our study. in italy, two non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae infections  were identified among  <dig> hospitalized patients with acute diarrhoea and both were associated with seafood consumption  <cit> . in cholera endemic regions, isolation of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae seems to be higher. in a  <dig> survey in kolkata, india, non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae constituted  <dig> % of the total v. cholerae isolations from hospitalised patients with acute diarrhoea  <cit> , although estimates based on the number of diarrhoeal cases were not available.

molecular typing of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates
in order to determine the genetic and epidemiological relatedness among the isolates, we first performed pfge analysis using the pulsenet standardised pfge protocol for v. cholerae. pfge is the gold standard of epidemiological typing as it offers high discriminatory power  <cit>  and is routinely used for epidemiological typing of food-borne pathogens by the zhejiang provincial center for disease control and prevention. thirty nine of the  <dig> isolates were typed using pfge and were divided into  <dig> pfge types  . of the six outbreak a isolates, four belonged to the same pfge pattern , while the other two had two different patterns  with only one band difference to pt <dig>  four outbreak b isolates had the same pfge pattern  and three others had a unique pattern . pt <dig> and pt <dig> were very similar to each other while pt <dig> and pt <dig> differed by three and four bands from pt <dig> respectively. the nine outbreak c isolates were separated into two distinctive patterns . the similarity in pfge patterns among the isolates was estimated using dice coefficient and was represented by a dendrogram in figure 2a. the dendrogram showed that outbreak c was most likely caused by two different strains since pt <dig> and pt <dig> were well separated in the dendrogram. interestingly, one isolate  obtained in the  <dig> active surveillance in hangzhou shared the same pfge pattern  with seven outbreak c isolates from quzhou. it seems that the pt <dig> strain causing the  <dig> outbreak in quzhou has been circulating in the neighbouring hangzhou city a year earlier.

all st <dig> outbreak c isolates  were grouped together but were placed within outbreak b pts and were closest to pt <dig> and pt <dig> . it should be noted that pt <dig> looked nearly identical to pt <dig> in figure 2a. however, closer examination of the pfge patterns showed that the two bands in pt <dig> clearly were not identical to those in pt <dig>  since the two outbreaks were separated by time and locality, it is interesting to note such a close relationship of the isolates, which also shows that epidemiological information must be considered in addition to pfge patterns in detecting outbreaks.

we further used multilocus sequence typing  to determine the relationships of and genetic heterogeneity among the isolates. seven housekeeping genes  selected based on a previous study  <cit>  were used for the mlst . mlst divided the  <dig> isolates into  <dig> sequence types  . st <dig> was predominant which consisted of  <dig> isolates. eburst  <cit>  analysis showed none of the sts formed a clonal complex. a minimum spanning tree was constructed  which showed three sets of closely related sts: st <dig>  st <dig> and st80; st <dig>  st <dig> and st89; and st <dig> and st <dig>  all differing by two genes. two sts  were isolated over two or more years and from different cities, suggesting that these two sts had a wide geographical distribution. for the three outbreaks, outbreak a was caused by st <dig> while outbreaks b and c were caused by st <dig>  however, the st <dig> isolates from outbreaks b and c can be separated by one band difference by pfge. additionally, two of the nine outbreak c isolates belonged to st <dig>  therefore, outbreak c was caused by two sts and possibly due to contamination of the source  by two different strains. there was also heterogeneity in isolates from the same city. the nine isolates from the  <dig> active surveillance in hangzhou were separated into six sts. thus, our mlst analysis showed that these non-o1/non-o <dig> isolates were genetically diverse and some strains such as those belonging to st <dig> can predominate across the regions.

we compared the relationships of isolates based on mlst  with those based on pfge. for the five sts  with two or more isolates, each individual st is associated with distinct pfge nodes with all isolates of the same st contained within the same node . additionally, two isolates of different sts, n <dig> of st <dig> and n <dig> of st <dig> were grouped together by pfge with a three-band difference and a 95% similarity . this was consistent with the mlst relationship as st <dig> was linked with st <dig> with a two-allele difference . the two alleles differed between st <dig> and st <dig> were gyrb and mdh with  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp differences, respectively. the differences in these genes may be due to recombination as v. cholerae undergoes recombination quite frequently  <cit> . therefore, relationships of isolates with high similarity in pfge patterns are consistent between pfge and mlst.

in contrast, the relationships of isolates with less similar pfge patterns were inconsistent with those based on mlst. for example, the st <dig> isolate n <dig> was grouped together with the st <dig> isolate n <dig> by pfge, while by mlst st <dig> and st <dig> were not linked together on the mst . these two isolates differed substantially in their banding patterns  and also differed in all seven alleles by mlst. similarly the grouping together of st <dig> and st <dig> by pfge was also inconsistent with their relationship based on mlst .

as measured by the index of diversity , the discriminatory power of pfge  was clearly higher than mlst  for characterisation of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae. pfge further divided isolates within an st for all sts except st <dig> in which there were only two isolates and both were from the same outbreak.

antibiotic resistance patterns amongst non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae isolates
antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using disk diffusion assay for  <dig> antibiotics and all or nearly all isolates were susceptible to cephalothin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, amikacin, doxycycline and norfloxacin. resistance to other antibiotics varied with 80% of the isolates resistant to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim ,  <dig> % to ampicillin,  <dig> % to rifampicin, 30% to nalidixic acid, 15% to tetracycline, 5% to ciprofloxacin and 5% to erythromycin. additionally, for rifampicin, erythromycin and tetracycline, the majority or nearly all of the remaining isolates were intermediate to the respective antibiotics . isolates obtained from the same outbreak may also vary in antibiotic resistance. however, most of these variations were due to intermediate resistance . the use of antimicrobial agents is generally regarded as an effective method to reduce the duration and symptoms of diarrhoea. tetracycline, erythromycin, sxt and ciprofloxacin have all been generally considered as the drug of choice for the treatment of cholera. however, the resistance profiles indicate that these antibiotics will not be or less effective for treating non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae infections.

antibiotic resistance profiles were also correlated with pfge or mlst relationships. all st <dig> isolates and all except one st <dig> isolate were resistant to sxt. the only sxt susceptible st <dig> isolate was grouped away from the other st <dig> isolates. all st <dig> isolates associated with outbreaks  were resistant to ampicillin. nalidixic acid resistance also has a restricted distribution. with the exception of the nalidixic acid resistant st <dig> isolate  and the nalidixic acid resistant st <dig> isolate  which are unrelated, nalidixic acid resistance was present only in the two st <dig> outbreak c isolates, all st <dig> outbreak a isolates and the two related st <dig> and st <dig> isolates. the two st <dig> isolates were the most drug resistant and shared the same resistance profile with resistance or intermediate to six antibiotics . the st <dig> and st <dig> isolates  grouped together by pfge shared a similar resistance profile with resistance or intermediate to five antibiotics .

the distribution of sxt resistance on the tree  revealed an interesting evolutionary history. sxt resistance in v. cholerae is carried by a conjugative, self-transmissible and integrative element  that also provides resistance to chloramphenicol and streptomycin  <cit> . the wide distribution of sxt resistance along the tree suggests that the sxt element is widespread, although previous studies mostly analysed v. cholerae o <dig> and o <dig> toxigenic strains for the presence of sxt element  <cit> . interestingly, one of the st <dig> isolates which was obtained from the  <dig> active surveillance was susceptible to sxt and presumably has lost the sxt element since every other isolate in the large pfge clusters was resistant to sxt. in contrast, the four sxt susceptible isolates  were grouped together as two pairs of isolates on different branches of the tree and are likely to have not gained the sxt element. resistance to the other antibiotics may be due to chromosomal mutations, plasmids or other mobile elements  <cit>  and are more difficult to make any evolutionary inference of the observed resistance patterns.

detection and distribution of virulence factors genes
pcr assays  were used for the detection of the ctxab <cit> , tcpa <cit> , zot <cit> , nag-st  <cit> , t3ss   <cit> , ompw <cit> , toxr <cit>  and hlya genes  <cit> . all isolates were positive for v. cholerae specific gene ompw by pcr, but were negative for ctxab, zot, tcpa and nag-st. all isolates were positive for toxr , except for n <dig> which was toxr negative. interestingly, n <dig> also differed from other st <dig> isolates in its pfge pattern. toxr codes for the transcriptional regulatory protein toxr  <cit>  and is expected to be present in all v. cholerae isolates. negative pcr amplification of toxr from n <dig> may be due to sequence divergence in primer binding regions. similarly, all isolates were positive for the haemolysin gene hlya . in contrast, the absence of ctxab, zot, tcpa and nag-st suggests that these non-o1/non-o <dig> isolates caused diarrhoea by a different mechanism from that used by toxigenic v. cholerae o <dig> and o <dig> 

*ta – annealing temperature.

# two primer pairs of tcpa primers were used. these two primer pairs have been used previously to amplify divergent tcpa alleles  <cit> .

recent reports suggest that t3ss is present in some non-o1/non-o <dig> isolates and plays an important role in virulence  <cit> . we tested for the presence of t3ss using two t3ss genes . thirty two carried both genes and presumably have a functional t3ss while five were negative for both genes. three isolates were negative for one of the genes, two isolates negative for vcsc <dig> and one isolate negative for vcsv <dig>  the primer binding regions in the genes of these isolates may be divergent leading to non-amplification, but it is also possible that the genes are deleted. it seemed that the pathogenicity of the majority of the isolates was due to the presence of the t3ss since  <dig> isolates possessed one or both t3ss genes ,which is different from that reported in bangladesh   <cit>  and in india   <cit> . the varying presence of virulence factors among different non-o1/non-o <dig> strains may be associated with their ability to cause disease. further studies are warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
our study is the first report which showed that non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae was an important pathogen in china, causing diarrhoeal infections with an isolation rate of  <dig> %. mlst revealed that a single st, st <dig>  was predominant in zhejiang province. st <dig> persisted over several years and appeared in different cities. it caused two outbreaks in recent years. since the majority of the isolates were positive for t3ss but negative for any other virulence factors tested, the t3ss was likely to be the key virulence factor for these isolates. resistance to commonly used antibiotics limits choice of drugs for treating non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae infections. our study highlights that non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae has been neglected as an important cause of diarrhoea in china and may be the same in other developing countries. close monitoring of non-o1/non-o <dig> v. cholerae capable of causing outbreaks in china is necessary to reduce the health burden of diarrhoeal infections caused by this pathogen.
