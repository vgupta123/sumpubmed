BACKGROUND
machine learning
machine learning  is the study and computer modeling of learning processes including the acquisition of new declarative knowledge, organization of new knowledge into general effective representations, and the discovery of new facts through observation and experimentation. machine learning programs are advantageous in many cases where the input/output pairs can be specified, but the concise relationship between the input/output pairs is not known. machine learning programs can help in extracting the complex relationships and correlations hidden in large data sets .

the prediction accuracy of different machine learning programs varies and depends on the type of problem, dataset and the algorithm used. examples of application domains include protein classification <cit>  tissue classification for different types of cancer <cit> , protein secondary structure prediction  <cit> , text mining <cit> , protein-protein interactions <cit>  and rna binding proteins <cit> . the most common ml algorithms include decision trees, production rules, support vector machines, na√Øve bayes, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. there are several free software suites available, including weka  <cit> , c <dig>   <cit> , and gist  <cit> .

snp discovery
single nucleotide polymorphisms  are single base variations or short insertions/deletions in the nucleotide sequence from different individuals or between homologous sequences within an individual. snp markers are relatively dense and abundant when compared to other marker types. snp can be used for distinguishing between individuals and species, genetic analysis of disease and complex traits, assessment of linkage disequilibrium , haplotype map generation, pharmacogenomics, etc. in a large scale snp discovery project after sequencing and assembly of the sequences from different individuals/genotypes, candidate snp are usually identified by using programs like polybayes  <cit>  or polyphred  <cit> .

polyphred is more commonly used for snp detection in re-sequencing data as it can detect the heterozygotes. polybayes was designed to statistically detect snps in multiple alignments of overlapping est or shotgun sequences. however, polybayes is more suitable for soybean re-sequencing data as soybean is an extensively in-bred species and most "heterozygous" bases observed would be due to single base differences between paralogs. each of the candidate snp identified by polybayes is expertly verified by visual inspection. the criteria for a good snp include high quality phred scores of the varying base position, minor allele frequency, agreement between the forward and reverse reads and co-variance of polymorphisms for the same genotype. this paper addresses the issue of reducing the amount of intervention required by human experts.

application of machine learning in polymorphism discovery
to reduce the cost of expert intervention in polymorphism discovery, we applied the ml program c <dig>   <cit>  to train a snp classifier model from an expert reviewed dataset. the classifier can be subsequently used to predict unseen cases. c <dig>  was chosen because it gives prediction for a previously unseen case and also generates a decision tree  that can be interpreted to understand the expert evaluation process in more detail . c <dig>  program is freely available with open source c code that can be compiled and executed on nearly any platform. a decision tree consists of a number of nodes, where each node corresponds to a test based on a single feature. at each point in the construction of the decision tree, c <dig>  selects the feature to test based on maximum information gain. the goal is to generate a minimum size tree that correctly classifies all the elements in the training set. the size of the tree is the number of nodes  and the numbers of errors are the misclassified cases. the program also gives projected prediction accuracy for unseen cases. production rules are generated by starting with an initial rule set and iteratively improving the rule set using heuristic techniques or by first generating a tree and then converting the tree into an equivalent rule set and finally pruning unnecessary rules.

specific objectives of this study were to

 identify features that can influence the polymorphism scoring decisions,

 develop a software program for applying the ml program c <dig>  to snp features,

 optimize features to improve prediction accuracy of the classifier,

 use optimized feature set on a large dataset for improved prediction accuracy.

RESULTS
training and test data
the training/test candidate polymorphism data for implementing ml algorithms was extracted from a large-scale soybean sts amplification and sequencing project. for the primers designed the sts that produced a single discrete band pcr product on agarose gel electrophoresis were sequenced. a total of  <dig> sts comprising  <dig> mb were sequenced from both directions in  <dig> inbred individuals representing each of  <dig> diverse soybean genotypes previously identified by zhu et al  <cit> . most of these data have a uniform sequence depth of  <dig> reads in each direction. these data were split into a training set consisting of  <dig> sts  with  <dig>  candidate polymorphisms  and a test set of  <dig> sts  with  <dig>  candidate polymorphisms. subject matter experts classified the above candidate polymorphisms as  <dig> true and  <dig>  false in the training set and  <dig> true and  <dig>  false in the test set.

application of polyphred
polyphred is a commonly used tool for polymorphism identification in re-sequencing data as it can detect heterozygotes. application of polyphred on the test data resulted in only  <dig> candidates . thus the sensitivity of this tool for this dataset is only  <dig> % with a positive predictive value of  <dig> %. the poor performance of polyphred in this case may be partly because of the un-suitability of this tool for in-bred species like soybean where heterozygosity is mostly due to sequencing noise or co-amplification of paralog sequences. in the latter case all genotypes appear to be "heterozygous" at a given position and polyphred identifies a snp at that position.

feature selection and optimization
while ml programs are useful for creating classifiers based on a given set of features, the selection of the relevant features is often a challenging task, usually requiring an iterative approach. we first selected a set of  <dig> features that were likely to influence the human expert when classifying a putative snp. these features were then optimized by modifying the existing features and adding new features that helped in improving the prediction accuracy. the final set of optimized features is given in table  <dig> 

a detailed definition and explanation of these features is given the methods section. the values for the features can be continuous in a given numerical range or discrete with limited options.

description of these features is given in the methods section. the optimization runs for feature selection are discussed in more detail at the website containing supplementary material  <cit> .

application of c <dig>  on training data and evaluation on test dataset
a software program was developed to extract the features described above, execute c <dig>  and analyze the results. the software features are described in the methods section  <dig> . a five fold cross-validation was performed on the training data of  <dig>  cases using both available options with c <dig>  i.e., decision tree and production rules. to perform the cross-validation, the data were divided into five parts and the ml classifier was recursively trained on four parts and tested on the remaining part . the performance of the resulting decision trees/production rules was evaluated . the average prediction accuracies of validation runs were above  <dig> %.

a new decision tree and production rule set was constructed using the training set of  <dig>  cases and was then applied to the test set of  <dig>  previously unseen cases. results are shown in table  <dig> 

we define the following terms used to contrast ml performance with polybayes: we say that a snp prediction program produces a true positive  if it predicts a snp that is judged true by the expert. likewise, a false positive  is a predicted snp that is judged false by the expert, a true negative  is a prediction of a non-snp that concurs with the expert, and a false negative  is a failure to identify a snp that is identified by the expert. also the following parameters were used to measure the performance of the ml output: accuracy , sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value  and negative predictive value 

accuracy = /total

sensitivity = tp/

specificity = tn/

positive predictive value  = tp/negative predictive value  = tn/

application of machine learning program substantially reduces the number of false positives from  <dig>  to only about  <dig>  other statistical measures also demonstrate considerable advantage in the application of machine learning.

since only polybayes predictions were used in both training and test data sets, the true negative and false negative terms for polybayes are not known for this study. the prediction accuracy of ml algorithms using both decision trees and production rules was above 96%. also implementation of ml algorithms resulted in  <dig> fold increase in productivity by increasing the ppv from  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

the number of false positives in the training/test data set is expected to decrease by increasing the polybayes threshold probability values. from table  <dig>  it can be observed that the numbers of tp and fp both increased with the polybayes probability score, to reach a maximum ppv of  <dig> % with a polybayes posterior probability of  <dig> . by using machine learning the overall ppv can be enhanced to  <dig> %. the ml ppv did not improve with the confidence values from the ml algorithm; hence confidence values were not informative.

tp: true positive, fp: false positive,

positive predictive value  = tp/.

the number of true positives in the dataset can be increased by using stringent polybayes posterior probability cut-off values. however, even when the posterior probability value is set to the maximum of  <dig>  the positive predictive value with polybayes is less than 20%. application of machine learning showed a 5‚Äì <dig> fold increase in the ppv at different polybayes posterior probability values.

subject matter expert re-analysis of a small sample of  <dig> candidate snp where ml algorithm prediction did not agree with the expert decision revealed that some of the decisions were subjective and those can influence the ml algorithm. out of the  <dig> re-evaluated calls,  <dig> calls were re-classified and  <dig> calls were confirmed to be correctly annotated by the expert previously. some of the reasons cited for re-classification were snp calls made even with poor sequence quality , misalignment of bases , deletions overlooked  and simple sequence repeat polymorphism  . similar considerations may account for some of the  <dig> % snp not flagged by the ml algorithm. subject matter experts scored differently in some cases especially with low reliability ambiguous sequence data and others were errors due to oversight. decision trees and production rules revealed interesting insights in the expert decision criteria and helped improve ml features .

ml programs other than c <dig> 
several ml algorithms other than c <dig>  such as neural networks, svm and genetic algorithms are being widely used. in this study we explored the use of feed forward neural networks  for the same dataset with different options  and obtained similar overall accuracies  and marginal increase in ppv up to 87%. details of these runs are provided as supplementary materials on the website. c <dig>  is free software that can be implemented with relative ease with an equivalent performance for the options tested with neural networks.

discussion
the soybean has a complex genome, with studies suggesting multiple rounds of duplication of some genomic regions resulting in high paralog frequency  <cit> , this complex genome structure may account to some extent for observing a higher number of false positive snp from the polybayes analysis. soybean is an extensively inbred species and the variation between the two homologous chromosomes is negligible. hence, polybayes, rather than polyphred, was used for snp discovery for these data. this paper only attempts to automate the expert confirmation process. to evaluate the performance of expert scoring a different ml training and test dataset is required. confirmed snp are currently being mapped to the soybean genome.

polybayes and polyphred are primarily used for analyzing small sequence datasets. large-scale, genome-wide snp discovery projects routinely use customized versions of neighborhood quality standard   <cit> . nqs is a set of rules for snp filtering based on the sequence quality of the varying base along with the quality of the neighborhood bases.

the application of ml is not dependent on the screening method used, but instead can be used with any of the aforementioned tools that are used for snp discovery. the ml tool simply automates the rule development and can be applied to small and large datasets where good training data are available.

machine learning has been applied to polymorphism discovery from amplified sts and was demonstrated to have a positive impact in polymorphism discovery. the optimized ml feature set can be tailored and applied to other instances of polymorphism discovery and ml in general can be applied to other genomics and bioinformatics decision making problems.

CONCLUSIONS
major efforts are now being undertaken in polymorphism discovery in several species, including humans, to help characterize population differences. ml can enhance the prediction accuracies of these existing programs. in this study we have

‚Ä¢ identified a feature set to enhance polymorphism prediction accuracies,

‚Ä¢ used the ml program c <dig>  to generate a decision tree  from a training set to obtain an overall prediction accuracy of 97% in the five fold cross-validation and from a new unseen test set,

‚Ä¢ enhanced the ppv by 5- to 10-fold compared to using only polybayes for these data, and

‚Ä¢ developed an open source software package in perl to apply machine learning in polymorphism discovery with modules for computation of the values of the optimized feature set, execution in test mode to retrieve predictions, a graphical interface for easy snp scoring and a provision to store feature values of new data for further improvements. the system and source code along with test and training data are provided in additional file  <dig> 

ml enhanced the prediction efficiency overall  along with the ppv  in soybean sequences with a complex genome that might have contributed to high false positives being predicted by polybayes. hence the ppv with sequences from other genomes may vary.
