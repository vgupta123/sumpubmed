BACKGROUND
neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human respiratory tract and occasionally causes meningitis and/or sepsis. disease-related strains can express either one of six different capsular polysaccharides . polysaccharide-based vaccines have been developed against four of these capsule types. unfortunately, the serogroup b capsular polysaccharide cannot be used as a vaccine due to its poor immunogenicity, while non-capsular antigens seem to be effective only temporarily and in specific geographic areas due to high antigenic variability in meningococci.

various outer-membrane components and secreted proteins exhibit variable expression and/or antigenic diversity, which plays an important role in immune escape and has serious implications for the development of effective vaccines
 <cit> . the high variability of these antigens is based on different mechanisms, including gene conversion and slipped-strand mispairing
 <cit> .

gene conversion is the non-reciprocal exchange of dna fragments situated at different chromosomal locations. it is based upon homologous recombination between the donor and recipient loci
 <cit> . virulence-associated surface structures in bacterial pathogens are often subject to antigenic variation by gene conversion. this has been studied extensively for the pilin locus of neisseria spp.
 <cit> . the retractile type iv pili of neisseria are involved in attachment to host tissues
 <cit> , dna acquisition
 <cit>  and twitching motility
 <cit> . in addition to the pilin expression locus pile, the genome of these bacteria contains a repertoire of promoter-less pils cassettes, with homologous and variable regions relative to pile. these pils cassettes can unidirectionally be transferred to the pile expression locus, resulting in partial alteration of the pilin sequence. alternatively, this recombination event can switch off the formation of pili by introduction of a premature stop codon in pile. the frequency of gene conversion seems to be strain and species dependent and can be as high as  <dig>  recombination events per cell in the case of gonococcal strain fa1090
 <cit> .

in two-partner secretion  systems, a large protein, generically called tpsa, is secreted through a specific outer membrane transporter, designated tpsb
 <cit> . tpsa is synthesized as a precursor with a signal sequence and transported to the periplasm via the sec machinery. in the periplasm, it interacts via its n-terminally located tps domain with tpsb and is transported to the cell surface. tps systems of n. meningitidis seem of relevance to pathogenicity as suggested by reported roles in adhesion
 <cit> , intracellular survival
 <cit>  and biofilm formation
 <cit> . cluster analysis of the sequences of the tpsb proteins and of the tps domains of the tpsa proteins revealed the presence of three different tps systems in n. meningitidis <cit> . different isolates of n. meningitidis can contain one to three different tps systems, and some of these systems can contain two tpsa genes
 <cit> . in the genome sequence of strain mc <dig>  for example, five different tpsa genes were identified, two of system  <dig> , two of system  <dig> , and one of system  <dig> . in contrast, the genome sequences of strains fam <dig>   <dig> and z <dig> contain only one single tpsa, i.e. a tpsa of system  <dig> 
 <cit> , which appears most widespread among meningococcal isolates
 <cit> . the tpsb and tpsa genes are situated on specific genetic islands on the chromosome. downstream of the tpsa genes, several tpsa-related open reading frames  are located, generically referred to as tpsc cassettes
 <cit> , interspersed with small intervening orfs  . as compared to tpsa, all tpsc cassettes are missing extensive portions at the 5’ end including the segment encoding the signal sequence and the tps domain. they do share sequence similarity with a central part of tpsa but show an entirely different 3’ terminal sequence
 <cit> . from this observation, it was postulated that these tpsc cassettes could substitute the 3’ end of tpsa by gene conversion, thereby causing antigenic variation of tpsa, similarly as in the pile/s system
 <cit> .

recently, aoki et al. described that certain tpsa proteins of e. coli inhibit the growth of related bacteria
 <cit> . this activity is mediated by direct contact between bacteria of the same species through the interaction of tpsa with the conserved outer membrane protein bama in the target cells
 <cit> . the activity, referred to as contact-dependent growth inhibition , was also observed in other bacteria
 <cit> .the cdi activity resides in the c-terminal region of tpsa, which is cleaved off from tpsa after interaction with the receptor and delivered in the cytoplasm of target cells, where it exerts dnase or trnase activity. immunity in the producing cells is provided by a small protein encoded by the orf immediately downstream of tpsa. this immunity protein binds the toxic domain of tpsa and inhibits its activity
 <cit> . like in the tps gene clusters of n. meningitidis, these tpsa genes are often followed by several 5’-truncated tpsa homologs displaying entirely different 3’ ends
 <cit> . it was proposed that these tpscs comprise a reservoir of alternative c-terminal regions and that exchange of the 3’ end of tpsa by a tpsc cassette alters the cdi mechanism
 <cit> . however, so far, no study addressed whether such substitutions at the 3’ end of tpsa actually take place.

in the present study, we first investigated whether also the meningococcal tpsa proteins mediate growth inhibition. then, we investigated whether recombination at the 3’ end of tpsa indeed occurs in vivo and what the frequency, the mechanism, and the function of such recombination might be.

RESULTS
meningococcal tpsa <dig> mediates growth inhibition
to investigate whether meningococcal tpsa proteins may possess growth-inhibitory activity, we initially focused on strain fam <dig>  which contains a single tps island with one tpsa <dig> gene and five tpsc cassettes 
 <cit> . however, since this strain appeared non-transformable, we switched to strain b16b <dig>  another reference strain of the same clonal complex , i.e. cc <dig>  sequencing of the complete tps island of strain b16b <dig>  revealed exactly the same genetic organization and > 99% sequence identity at the nucleotide level with that of fam <dig>  the tpsa protein of b16b <dig> shows only three amino-acid substitutions relative to that of fam <dig> 

next, we constructed a Δtpsa-tpsc mutant of strain b16b <dig> lacking tpsa and all tpsc cassettes and iorfs. in addition, since the presence of a capsule inhibits cdi in e. coli <cit> , we used capsule-deficient derivatives in all assays described below. when we co-incubated the wild type and the Δtpsa-tpsc mutant in liquid medium as described for e. coli <cit> , no growth inhibition of the mutant was observed independent of the media used , co-incubation time  or initial ratio of target and killer cells . it has been reported that meningococcal tpsa affects later stages of biofilm development  and that its production is increased under anaerobic conditions
 <cit> . thus, we co-incubated the wild type and the mutant on agar plates in a candle jar with low oxygen concentrations. under these conditions, growth inhibition of the mutant was observed as a decline in time of the ratio of the colony-forming units  of the mutant over that of the wild type . in contrast, growth of a Δtpsb mutant, which is defective in the secretion of tpsa but still contains all iorfs, was not affected when co-incubated with the wild type . also, growth of a Δtpsc2- <dig> mutant, which lacks tpsc <dig> to tpsc <dig> and the iorfs in between, but still contains iorf <dig> and iorf <dig>  was not affected when co-incubated with the wild type , suggesting that protection against the growth-inhibiting properties of tpsa is mediated by iorf <dig> and/or iorf <dig> 

to confirm the role of the iorf <dig> immediately downstream of tpsa in b16b <dig> in conferring immunity, the corresponding gene was cloned behind an isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside -inducible promoter on plasmid and introduced into the Δtpsa-tpsc mutant. growth of the complemented strain was inhibited when co-incubated with the wild-type strain in the absence but not in the presence of iptg . thus, the iorf indeed confers immunity to growth inhibition mediated by tpsa. in conclusion, the meningococcal tpsa protein has growth-inhibitory activity and the iorf immediately downstream of tpsa provides immunity to this activity.

structural organization of meningococcal tpsa <dig> and tpsc proteins
to study possible genetic exchange between tpsa genes and tpsc cassettes, we first extended previous bioinformatic analyses using available genome sequences
 <cit> , thereby focusing on tps system  <dig> because of its widespread presence in meningococcal isolates. the genetic organization of tps system  <dig> islands in the available genome sequences of strains α14
 <cit> , α153
 <cit> , α275
 <cit> , 053442
 <cit> , 8013
 <cit> , fam18
 <cit> , mc58
 <cit>  and z2491
 <cit>  is depicted in figure s <dig> in additional file
 <dig> with selected examples shown in figure 
 <dig> 

multiple sequence alignments of the corresponding tpsa proteins  revealed that they are modular and consist of three regions: a highly conserved n-terminal region, a semi-variable central region, and a hyper-variable c-terminal region. the n-terminal region of ~ <dig> amino acids shows > 98% identity between all aligned sequences and contains the tps domain required for interaction with the tpsb protein in the outer membrane. for the central region of ~ <dig> amino-acid residues, two main allelic variants were identified designated core  <dig> and core  <dig> . these sequences showed > 19% divergence between the groups and < 2% divergence within the groups. the c-terminal regions of ~ <dig> amino-acid residues, where the toxic activity of tpsa resides, are highly variable with sequence divergence ranging from 5-50%. sequence divergence is particularly high in the last ~ <dig> residues, where five different groups of sequences can be discriminated among the  <dig> tpsa proteins compared . these c-terminal domains show very high sequence conservation within the groups  and extremely low, if any, sequence similarity between the groups.

the polypeptides putatively encoded by the tpsc cassettes are variable in length . in their n-terminal part upstream of a conserved venn motif , they share sequence similarity with tpsa proteins . the corresponding dna sequences are presumably used for homologous recombination into the tpsa locus. downstream of the venn motif and particularly within the c-terminal moieties of ~ <dig> amino-acid residues, the sequences are again hyper-variable , some sharing high sequence similarity with c-terminal segments of tpsa proteins and others constituting new groups of c-terminal domains. sequence comparisons identified  <dig> different groups of tpsa/tpsc c-terminal sequences  with > 90% of similarity within the groups . the results of such sequence analyses are consistent with the occurrence in vivo of the suggested gene conversion at the 3’ end of the tpsa gene
 <cit> . for example, the tpsa of strain z <dig> could have been generated by recombination of a tpsc cassette similar to tpsc <dig> of strain fam <dig> into a tpsa like nmb <dig> of mc <dig> . however, it should be noted that also recombination mechanisms other than gene conversion could be responsible for the observed variation in the 3’ end of tpsa.

the polypeptides encoded by the iorfs located in between tpsa and tpscs  putatively encode immunity proteins to confer protection against the toxic activity of the products of the directly upstream located tpsa or tpsc. they can be grouped with > 95% sequence similarity within the groups and very low, if any, similarity between the groups . interestingly, tpsas and tpscs with a similar c-terminal sequence are always immediately followed by an iorf from the same sequence group. iorfs of the same group are colored identically in figure 
 <dig> and figure s <dig> in additional file
 <dig>  and, to reflect the interconnectivity with the upstream tpsa/tpsc, the same color is used for the iorfs as for the c-terminal ends of the upstream tpsa or tpsc.

replacement of the 3’ end of tpsa is rare in cc <dig> and cc <dig> strains
the bioinformatic analysis above is consistent with the occurrence of the suggested gene conversion at the 3’ end of meningococcal tpsa. however, the tps islands in the strains analyzed could also have been acquired independently by horizontal gene transfer from different sources. to determine whether recombination of tpsc cassettes with the 3’ end of tpsa indeed occurs in vivo, we decided to analyze the tps system  <dig> of various isolates from the same cc. if recombination indeed takes place at frequencies comparable, for example, to that reported for gene conversion at the pile locus, different tpsc cassettes would be expected to be present at the c terminus of tpsa in such isolates. for this purpose, we first focused on cc <dig>  a lineage predominantly associated with invasive disease
 <cit>  and therefore useful to evaluate the possible implications of such recombination events during human infection.

the observation that the organization of the tps island of b16b <dig> is very similar to that of fam <dig>  in spite of the very different isolation years of these strains being  <dig> years apart  already suggested that the tps loci might actually be rather stable. we then decided to analyze a large panel of  <dig> cc <dig> disease isolates collected in the netherlands between  <dig> and  <dig> . we used pcr to assess for possible replacements of the 3’ end of tpsa by tpsc cassettes as outlined in detail in figure s <dig> in additional file
1; the results for individual isolates are listed in additional file
2: table s <dig>  with only three exceptions, which are described in detail in the next section, all isolates showed the presence of the same cassette at the 3’ end of tpsa as in fam <dig>  these results demonstrate that the tpsa locus in cc <dig> strains is remarkably stable. a possible explanation for the observed stability of tpsa is that the cassette present at the c terminus of tpsa in cc <dig> isolates is maintained because it is required for the highly invasive phenotype of these strains or because of reduced interbacterial competition during infection. to investigate this possibility, we also analyzed six cc <dig> carrier isolates using similar procedures , which revealed again the same organization as that in fam <dig>  suggesting that the 3’ end of tpsa is also stably maintained in these isolates and that the lack of exchange is not favored by host invasion.

for comparison, we determined the frequency of another well-known mechanism of genetic variation, i.e. phase-variation by slipped-strand mispairing at direct dna repeats, in cc <dig> strains. thus, the expression of the autotransporter nalp and the outer membrane opa proteins, which both exhibit phase-variable expression
 <cit> , was evaluated by western blotting in a panel of  <dig> cc <dig> isolates, including both carrier and disease isolates . of these isolates,  <dig> were positive for nalp expression  and  <dig> for opa expression . thus, the frequency of recombination at the 3’ end of the tpsa gene is clearly much lower than that of another genetic mechanism of variation used by this pathogen during infection.

finally, we analyzed strains from another hyperinvasive cc, i.e. cc <dig>  using the same strategy. the tps island of cc <dig> strain nmb was recently reported to have a similar organization as that in fam18
 <cit> . we sequenced tpsa of another cc <dig> strain, strain  <dig> , and found 99% identity at the nucleotide level with tpsa of fam <dig>  pcr analysis targeted for various fragments in the downstream region  indicated the same organization of tpscs as in fam <dig>  next, a panel of  <dig> cc <dig> disease isolates was analyzed ; all of them appeared to contain the same cassette at the 3’ end of tpsa as in fam <dig>  thus, recombination at the 3’ end of the tpsa locus did not occur in the isolates examined and is therefore rare, also in cc <dig> strains.

characterization of the tps island in the deviating cc <dig> isolates
the three cc <dig> isolates that, according to the pcr analysis, deviated from fam <dig> at the 3’ end of tpsa, i.e. isolates  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , all produced a tpsa as evidenced by western blotting . further pcr analysis of the tps island of isolates  <dig> and  <dig>  indicated that the tpsc <dig> cassette had recombined into the tpsa locus with loss of the intervening dna as depicted in figure 
3a. sequence analysis of the entire tps island of isolate  <dig>  confirmed this suggestion. of note, tpsc <dig> of fam <dig> shows 99% sequence identity between bp 195– <dig> with a segment of tpsa  . comparison of the upstream and downstream sequences indicated that the recombination resulting in the tpsa of isolate  <dig> had occurred in this shared region. the sequence downstream of tpsa in isolate  <dig> showed > 99% identity with the region downstream of tpsc <dig> in fam <dig> . this region was also similar in isolate  <dig> . thus, the results for these isolates demonstrate that replacement of the 3’ end of tpsa by tpsc cassettes indeed occurs in vivo, albeit at a very low frequency.
 <dig>  the ratios of  <dig> bacteria over b16b <dig>  or b16b6Δtpsa-tpsc mutant  bacteria were determined after  <dig> hours  or  <dig> hours  of incubation by plating on gc media containing erythromycin or chloramphenicol.

sequence analysis of the complete tps island of the third deviant cc <dig> strain, isolate  <dig> , revealed more complex rearrangements . the encoded tpsa has a central core  <dig> region like in strain z <dig> instead of a core  <dig> as in fam <dig> , and it contains a c terminal end identical to that of tpsc <dig> of z <dig> . thus, compared to z <dig>  the 3’ end of tpsa is replaced by tpsc <dig> in isolate  <dig>  sequence comparisons  suggest that the recombination event took place between bp 4174– <dig> of tpsa and bp 910– <dig> of tpsc <dig>  where these sequences show high sequence identity.

the iorf downstream of tpsa in isolate  <dig> is identical to that downstream of tpsc <dig> of z <dig> . the subsequent tpsc <dig> in  <dig> showed 94% identity within the first  <dig> bp with the corresponding 5’ fragment of tpsc <dig> of z <dig> . the rest of this tpsc <dig> was identical to the 3’ end of tpsc <dig> of fam <dig> , differing only in one single bp. at the boundary, an 18-bp sequence is shared between the three genes , which was likely involved in the recombination event; apparently, only short stretches of 100% identity are required for this. the remaining part of the tps island of isolate  <dig> showed > 99% identity with the corresponding region of fam <dig> . thus, it appears that the tpsa of isolate  <dig> was generated by recombination between a tpsa and a tpsc1similar to those of z <dig>  this tpsa gene was then introduced in the cc <dig> strain by recombination at the 5’ end in the dna encoding the tps domain of tpsa or in tpsb and at the 3’ end within tpsc <dig> 

a possible explanation for the low frequency of recombination observed at the 3’ end of tpsa in vivo is that such recombination results in the concomitant loss of the downstream iorf, which provides immunity to the tpsa of the parental strain. thus, within a microbial community such as a biofilm or a microcolony, the growth of a recombinant would be inhibited by its congeners. to investigate whether recombination indeed confers a growth disadvantage in the presence of a wild-type strain, we performed growth-inhibition experiments with the recombinant isolate  <dig> and strain b16b <dig>  the growth of the deviating isolate was drastically reduced when co-cultured with b16b <dig> , presumably because it is not protected against tpsa of b16b <dig>  the growth of strain  <dig> was not inhibited when the strain was co-cultured with the Δtpsa-tpsc mutant of b16b <dig>  which does not produce tpsa , demonstrating that the tpsa of strain b16b <dig> is responsible for the growth inhibition of isolate  <dig>  in the latter experiment , rather the growth of the Δtpsa-tpsc mutant appeared to be inhibited, indicating that the recombinant tpsa produced by isolate  <dig> has growth-inhibitory activity against which the Δtpsa-tpsc mutant of b16b <dig> is not protected presumably because it lacks all immunity proteins including that encoded by the iorf immediately downstream of the tpsc <dig> cassette. consistent with this notion is the observation that the growth of the Δtpsb mutant of b16b <dig>  which does not secrete tpsa but has retained all iorfs, was not inhibited by isolate  <dig> . to further confirm that the growth of isolate  <dig> is inhibited in the presence of b16b <dig> because it lacks the iorf immediately downstream of tpsa of b16b <dig> , the strain was transformed with plasmid pfpiorf <dig>  which contains this iorf under lac promoter control, and competition experiments with b16b <dig> were performed in the presence or absence of iptg. the growth inhibition of the plasmid-containing  <dig> target cells was reduced by  <dig>  log units  in the presence as compared to the absence of iptg. together, these data support the hypothesis that recombination at the tpsa locus confers a selective disadvantage within a genetically similar community because of the loss of the relevant immunity protein.

comparison of the frequency of exchange at the pile and tpsa loci
the results described above confirmed that the 3’ end of tpsa can be replaced by tpsc cassettes in vivo but at a much lower frequency than anticipated considering the reported high frequency of recombination at the pile locus. however, it was reported recently that also gene conversion at the pile locus is not detectable in cc <dig> and cc <dig> isolates
 <cit> . although this can be explained by the nature of the pile and pils genes present in these strains , we cannot exclude the possibility that cc <dig> and cc <dig> strains contain some additional genetic defect that reduces the recombination frequency also at the tpsa locus. to rule out this possibility, we analyzed another clonal lineage, which is known to be proficient in recombination at the pile locus, i.e. cc32
 <cit> , even though this analysis is more complicated by the presence of two tpsa <dig> copies in strains of this cc, such as mc <dig> .

we examined  <dig> cc <dig> disease isolates. first, the region corresponding to the pile locus was amplified by pcr as described
 <cit> . three isolates did not yield an amplicon, suggestive of loss of the pile locus, whilst two yielded a smaller amplicon than expected suggesting recombination with a pils . in a subsequent pcr, one of the primers annealed to a variable region in pile. of the  <dig> isolates positive for pile,  <dig> did not yield an amplicon in this pcr , demonstrating recombination relative to the pile sequence of mc <dig> in at least 28% of the strains.

next, recombination at the tpsa <dig> loci was examined by pcr as outlined in detail in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  this analysis revealed that the tpsa1b locus corresponding to nmb <dig> of strain mc <dig> was stably maintained in all isolates. however, the tpsa1a locus corresponding to nmb <dig> was detected in the initial pcr in only 37/ <dig> isolates suggesting that either recombination had occurred at this tpsa <dig> locus in the remaining  <dig> isolates or the tpsa <dig> locus was not duplicated in these isolates. subsequent pcrs targeting the boundaries of the tps islands  revealed the absence of the duplication in  <dig> of these isolates. in the remaining two isolates, the duplication was detected and thus, apparently, recombination had occurred at the tpsa1a locus. subsequent pcrs  revealed the presence in one of these isolates of a tpsa <dig> similar to that of fam <dig>  i.e. with a central core different from that of the tpsa <dig> genes of mc <dig>  therefore, this tpsa <dig> must have been acquired in this isolate by horizontal gene transfer. in the other isolate, we detected that the tpsc <dig> located downstream of tpsa1b had recombined into the tpsa1a locus . thus, in  <dig> isolates containing in total  <dig> tpsa <dig> genes, only a single case of tpsa/c exchange was detected , in agreement with the low frequency detected in cc <dig> and cc <dig> isolates and much lower than the frequency of gene conversion at the pile locus in the same set of strains. consistent with our results, also in the newly available genome sequence of cc <dig> isolate h44/76
 <cit> , the organization of the tpsa1-containing islands is similar to that in mc <dig> whilst the pile gene is different.

recombination within tps sequences under laboratory conditions
one of the models for gene conversion at the pile locus implicates the acquisition of pils sequences from the environment
 <cit> . hence, we investigated whether we could induce recombination at the 3’ end of tpsa by exogenously supplying tpsc cassettes. in preliminary experiments, we incubated purified chromosomal dna from strain b16b <dig> with the homologous  or heterologous  strains. pcr analysis of randomly picked colonies failed to provide evidence for recombination at the 3’ end of tpsa , indicating that such events are rare consistent with the low recombination frequencies found in vivo. then, a kanamycin-resistance  cassette was inserted between the 5’ end of tpsc <dig> and the 3’ end of the tps island . when chromosomal dna of the resulting mutant, designated b16b6Δtpsc2- <dig>  was used to transform the parent strain b16b <dig>  the kan cassette was found at the same position as in the original mutant in all  <dig> transformants examined as evidenced by pcrs. apparently, the high sequence identity at either side of the kan cassette forces reciprocal exchange by homologous recombination. when strain α <dig> was transformed, recombination had occurred within the 5’ region of the disrupted tpsc <dig> cassette of the donor dna and the tpsa gene in the recipient dna in all  <dig> kanamycin-resistant transformants examined as revealed in pcrs and subsequent sequence analysis . recombination in the various transformants had taken place at a variety of small stretches of sequence identity ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . these results demonstrate that tpsc sequences can recombine into the 3’ end of a tpsa gene when exogenously supplied and that recombination does not occur at a specific site but can take place at any short stretch of sequence identity within a homologous region.

next, chromosomal dna from one of the α14-tpsa* recombinants  was used to transform strain α <dig>  which has a different central core region in the tpsa gene . two kanamycin-resistant transformants were obtained and pcr analysis and subsequent sequencing  revealed that the disrupted tpsa of the donor dna had recombined into the tps island of α <dig> . thus, not only can tpsc cassettes recombine into the 3’ region of tpsa genes but also the central region of the tpsa gene can be replaced as was observed in vivo in the case of cc <dig> isolate  <dig> 

discussion
tpsa <dig> proteins of n. meningitidis have reported roles in adhesion
 <cit> , intracellular survival
 <cit>  and biofilm formation
 <cit> . in several other bacteria, tpsa proteins have been described that inhibit the growth of related bacteria probably in competition for the same niche
 <cit> . this cdi activity resides in the c-terminal domain, and an immunity protein encoded by the gene downstream of tpsa protects the producing strain. together, the c-terminal domain of tpsa and the immunity protein function as a toxin/antitoxin pair. we demonstrated here that also the tpsa <dig> proteins of n. meningitidis have growth-inhibitory activity and that the iorf immediately downstream of the tpsa gene confers immunity.

downstream of the tpsa gene, the tps islands of n. meningitidis contain a variable number of putative genes, called tpsc cassettes, interspersed with iorfs. the tpsc cassettes putatively encode n-terminally truncated tpsa homologs, which present entirely different c-terminal domains. it was suggested that these tpsc cassettes could recombine with tpsa by gene conversion possibly as a mechanism of immune evasion
 <cit> . also in several toxin/antitoxin systems, silent genes encoding truncated toxins are present and it was suggested that recombination of these silent genes with the toxin gene alters the cdi mechanism
 <cit> . however, up to date no direct experimental evidence for such recombination events has been reported.

initial bioinformatic analysis indeed suggested extensive recombination between tpsa genes and tpsc cassettes, as many cases were found of sequences that are present at the 3’ end of a tpsc cassette in one genome and at the 3’ end of a tpsa gene in another genome . however, because of the different phylogenetic origins of these strains, these observations do not directly prove that recombination does occur in vivo. therefore, to demonstrate that the expected recombination events indeed occur and to determine their frequency, we turned to the analysis of large collections of strains of the same clonal complexes. initially, we focused on strains of cc <dig> and cc <dig>  and we obtained evidence that tpsc cassettes can indeed recombine in vivo into the tpsa locus, but the observed frequency was dramatically lower than the frequency of antigenic variation by slipped-strand mispairing of other surface structures in the same collection of strains. in cc <dig> and cc <dig> isolates, gene conversion at the pile locus is not detectable either
 <cit> . this is, however, not due to a general recombination defect also affecting the tpsa locus but to the nature of the pile and pils genes present in these strains. n. meningitidis strains can elaborate one of two classes of pili. whereas class i pili are closely related to gonococcal pili, class ii pili present remarkably different features, i.e. lack of conserved regions in between the semi- and hyper-variable regions, deletion in a hyper-variable region, and no homology to class i pili in the flanking sequences
 <cit> . the cc <dig> and cc <dig> strains contain a class ii pile <cit>  and the genome of fam <dig> shows only two pils cassettes, which exhibit strong homology to type-i pilin genes
 <cit> . therefore, pile/s recombination is not to be expected and the low recombination frequency at the tpsa locus must have a different cause. consistent with this hypothesis, we also found a very low frequency of recombination in the tpsa locus in cc <dig> isolates, which are proficient in recombination at pile. considering that the strains we analyzed are from hyperinvasive lineages, the low frequency of recombination at the 3’ end of tpsa compared to known mechanisms of antigenic variation suggests that the selection of new tpsa variants in vivo is not driven by immune pressure. also, although n. meningitidis apparently has a large repertoire of alternate cassettes that could replace the killing module at the c terminus of tpsa, it apparently has only a low tendency to change it. this suggests that replacement of the c-terminal cassette of tpsa may even be detrimental to the bacteria. in the nasopharynx, n. meningitidis appears in microcolonies
 <cit> . obviously, within such a microcolony, the substitution of the c terminus of tpsa with the concomitant loss of the immunity protein as found in some cc <dig> isolates  would be detrimental as the protection against other cells within the community would be lost.

although the frequency is low, the postulated recombination at the 3’ end of tpsa was confirmed both in vivo and in vitro. figure 
5a illustrates a model for the recombination mechanism as deduced from our work. we postulate that the minimal recombination unit consists of a tpsc, an iorf and the 5’ region of the next tpsc. homologous recombination occurs in the borders of the recombination unit in the donor dna with equivalent sequences in the recipient dna. during the recombination event, a variable number of additional tpscs, together with their downstream iorfs, can be incorporated or lost in the recipient dna, which may result in extensive modification of the tpsc repertoire and may or may not alter the 3’ end of the tpsa gene. the sequences of the iorfs located immediately downstream of tpsas or tpscs with similar 3’ ends are highly conserved and show no sequence similarity with other iorfs. in the recombination models, the iorfs always remain associated with the upstream tpsc and will therefore confer immunity to the producing strain when this tpsc is recombined into the tpsa expression locus . besides this process, the central region of the tpsa can also be replaced in which case the recombination at the 5’ end occurs within the dna encoding the tps domain or in tpsb or even further upstream, and at the 3’ end in the 5’ region of a downstream tpsc. no functional activity has been assigned to this central core region. perhaps, it is only required for the efficient secretion and surface exposure of the killing module. however, considering its size and variability, it may serve additional functions. besides mediating growth inhibition, meningococcal tpsa proteins are also involved in adhesion
 <cit> , intracellular survival
 <cit>  and biofilm formation
 <cit> . further experiments should clarify if the core region has a direct role in these additional tpsa activities.

neisseria shows autolytic behavior and has the capacity to take up neisserial dna fragments by recognition of specific dna uptake sequences
 <cit> . the acquisition of pils sequences from the environment is used for recombination of pils to pile <cit> . the presence of dna uptake sequences within the tps islands, mostly located at the 5’ end of tpsc cassettes , is consistent with the hypothesis that donor dna for recombination in tpsa can be acquired from the medium. our in vitro recombination studies offer experimental support for this mechanism. obviously, for exchange of the central core region of tpsa, uptake of donor dna from the environment is a necessity. another model explains pile/s gene conversion based on intracellular recombination substrates and assumes that dna replication producing two chromosomes precedes recombination by double crossover
 <cit> . yet another model implicates the generation of an extrachromosomal circular intermediate generated by a single crossover 
 <cit> . both models could explain the tps organization in cc <dig> isolates in which the tpsc <dig> cassette has apparently recombined into the tpsa locus . it is interesting to note that tpsc <dig> of fam <dig> is the most distal tpsc in many tps regions . the absence of a downstream tpsc cassette for establishing recombination may prevent its movement to another position in the tpsc repertoire. in the genome of strain α <dig>  this tpsc has recombined into the tpsa gene with concomitant loss of all intervening tpscs , which can be explained through a single crossover recombination event. thus, like in the pile/pils system
 <cit> , recombination of tpscs into the tpsa locus can be mediated by three different mechanisms involving uptake of dna from the environment, recombination between sister chromosomes, or an intra-chromosomal single crossover event.

where exactly the recombination between tpsa and tpsc cassettes takes place, has remained unclear thus far. based on in silico analysis, it was previously predicted to be mediated by multiple direct repeats located in the 3’ half of tpsa and the 5’ end of tpscs <cit> . in contrast, poole and colleagues suggested that these events take place at a more specific location, i.e. the venn domain that is present in many tpsas and tpscs
 <cit> , including tpsa and tpscs of n. meningitidis . the results presented here show that the recombination can take place in small shared stretches of different length  that are broadly distributed along a larger homology domain , in line with what was reported in the pile/s system
 <cit> .

although the postulated recombination at the 3’ end of tpsa was demonstrated in this study, the frequency was very low. if the recombination frequency is that low and recombination may even be detrimental, why have most n. meningitidis isolates generated such a large collection of tpsc cassettes? possibly, the importance of the collection is not in the tpsc cassettes, but in the associated iorfs that, together, confer immunity to a large variety of tpsas produced by competitors in the nasopharynx. consistent with the proposed minor role of the tpsc cassettes is that we detected many tpscs with internal stop codons, frameshift mutations or extensive truncations at the 3’ end removing the homology domain for recombination into the tpsa locus .

CONCLUSIONS
several tpsa proteins produced by gram-negative bacteria inhibit the growth of other related bacteria probably in competition for the same niche. the toxic activity resides in its c-terminal region while an immediately downstream located iorf encodes an antitoxin protein. here, we showed that also meningococcal tpsa mediates growth inhibition and that the downstream iorf confers immunity to the producing strain. we also demonstrated that tpsc cassettes can recombine into the tpsa locus leading to the presentation of a different toxic module at the c terminus of tpsa. we obtained evidence for such recombination both in vivo during infection and under laboratory conditions. however, new tpsa variants are generated only at a very low frequency possibly due to negative selection against recombination as consequence of the concomitant loss of the immunity protein resulting in sensitivity to the tpsa protein produced by the congeners in the same microbial community. the tpsc cassettes for recombination can be acquired from the environment and recombine into the tpsa gene or in the downstream region, potentially resulting in an increased or decreased number of tpsc cassettes and associated iorfs. we propose that the main goal of recombination is the collection of new iorfs for protection against a variety of tpsa proteins. further studies on the mechanisms of tpsa-mediated fratricide might eventually enable us to fight these pathogens with their own weapons.
