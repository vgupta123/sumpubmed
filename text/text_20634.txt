BACKGROUND
in most natural environments bacteria exist as highly structured dense surface attached aggregates designated as biofilms  <cit> . this applies also to bacteria colonizing the skin and human mucosa. under certain conditions, biofilms may cause disease. classical examples are gingivitis and chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. dental plaque colonizing teeth initiates inflammation in the adjacent host gingival epithelium. the epithelial cells lining the crevice between the gum and the tooth are the first line of defense to the plaque bacteria  <cit> . dental plaque has long been recognized as a complex polymicrobial biofilm  <cit> . the maturation of this biofilm involves a change in the microbiota from predominantly gram-positive facultative anaerobes to gram-negative anaerobic bacteria  <cit> . as the plaque accumulates, it induces inflammation in the adjacent host tissues and the biofilm over time extends under the gum, down the root surface, creating a niche favoring the growth of fastidious anaerobes, such as spirochaetes and bacteriodetes  <cit> .

until very recently, in vitro experiments to elucidate this host-parasite relationship, utilized human cell line cultures challenged with putative pathogenic periodontal bacteria that were invariably used in the planktonic state, that is as cell suspensions in growth media or buffered solutions. evidence from such experiments is far disconnected from in vivo conditions and although useful as a first approach, they poorly reflect the challenge to host cells by multi-species biofilms. biofilms are comprised of either mono-species or multi-species biocenoses  <cit> , and their eradication is more difficult than for planktonic bacteria as they are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents and the host's immune response  <cit> . pathogenic biofilms are often associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis, or chronic conditions that are difficult to treat such as the colonization of urinary catheters and endotracheal tubings  <cit> . biofilm or co-culture studies composed of one to three bacteria have been reported in the past  <cit> ; however, with hundreds of different bacteria present in the human mouth, a more extensive biofilm study model will better elucidate the cellular responses triggered by bacteria that usually colonize with other bacteria in vivo.

we developed an in vitro biofilm model mimicking subgingival plaque to challenge cultured primary gingival epithelial cells  in order to assess interactions that may reflect more accurately the in vivo processes occurring in the gingival epithelium during the initiation of periodontal inflammation. in comparison to epithelial cell lines, hgecs are optimal, since the former have characteristics and receptors similar to fibroblasts and other cell types  <cit> . the bacterial species incorporated in the in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm were chosen carefully based on the following criteria: 1) published reports that the species were frequently found and numerous in periodontal disease sites; and 2) that the species were cultivatable to permit enumeration and also measurable by fluorescent in situ hybridization  and if possible immunofluorescence , in additional species-specific single-cell detection assays to ensure quality control. we thus compiled a list of nine microorganisms that, when incorporated in a biofilm, included widely accepted pathogenic microbiota  <cit> . besides members of the gingival crevice plaque  it comprises taxa detected most commonly in deep periodontal pockets and widely utilized in virulence experiments  with planktonic cells.

we describe here the procedures to generate the complex 'subgingival' in vitro biofilms and the techniques used to challenge hgec with such biofilms. we report on the kinetics and reproducibility of biofilm formation and on the effects of the biofilm on epithelial cells in terms of generating apoptosis, inducing pro-inflammatory primary and secondary cytokines, and triggering direct biofilm-mediated cytokine degradation.

RESULTS
characterization of biofilm composition
we generated in vitro 'subgingival' biofilms containing nine different bacterial species representative of marginal and subgingival plaque. we determined the kinetics of biofilm formation using three independent bacteria detection and enumeration assays to quantitate all biofilm members . scraped from the surface of the hydoxyapatite discs after only  <dig> min of anaerobic incubation to evaluate initial adherence, the bacteria showed large quantitative inter-species differences. campylobacter rectus accounted for nearly 90% of the cells at this time point. v. dispar, a. naeslundii, and s. oralis were in 1-10% range, whereas the other five organisms were all below  <dig> % of the total cfu. fish and if, as optical single cell identification techniques, were not sufficiently sensitive to reliably enumerate all nine species at  <dig> min.

cell accumulation in the biofilm was fastest during the initial presence of the inoculum suspension . thereafter, the total cell number  as well as the cell numbers of the individual species continued to increase by approximately two log steps until the experiments were stopped at  <dig>  h of biofilm formation. culture and fish analyses yielded very similar data for a. naeslundii, s. oralis, and v. dispar. the other more fastidious taxa were detected in somewhat higher numbers by fish and if . cell viability in  <dig>  h biofilms was estimated microscopically by the in-/exclusion of fluorescent dyes and reached consistently 85%.

the reproducibility of biofilm formation was studied by performing four completely independent experiments, each in triplicate and at least one week apart from each other. when examined by optical single cell analysis, little variation was observed between independent experiments for all but the two putative subgingival pathogens p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia, suggesting that these fastidious organisms had the most difficulties to establish in the biofilms. this interpretation is supported by the corresponding culture data , where, together with fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia, these species showed the lowest level of colonization and the largest variation. f. nucleatum and p. intermedia colonized the biofilms consistently at high densities  but were markedly underscored by culture due to their fastidious growth requirements. changes of the nutritional conditions resulted in the formation of biofilms of quantitatively different composition . in general, an increase of the serum concentration at the cost of the saliva concentration led to higher total cfu per biofilm and to equal or higher cfu of the individual species. p. intermedia was a notable exception by colonizing best in the medium with 30% mfum, 60% saliva and only 10% serum which are the conditions used in the following for our co-culture experiments with hgec.

culture conditions: a, 35% saliva + 35% human serum + 30% fum with 3% glucose, anaerob ; b, 35% saliva + 35% human serum + 30% fum with 3% glucose, aerob ; c, 60% saliva + 10% human serum + 30% fum with 3% glucose, anaerob ; d, 60% saliva + 10% human serum + 30% fum with 3% glucose, aerob ; e, 70% human serum + 30% fum with 3% glucose, aerob ; f, 70% human serum + 30%  <dig> % nacl, aerob . species abbreviations are as defined in the legend to figure  <dig> 

biofilm structure
bacteria were stained by multiplex fish and assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy . representative images are shown in fig.  <dig>   <dig>  h biofilms had a thickness of  <dig> to  <dig> μm with broad distribution of s. intermedius, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum. in contrast, t. forsythia, and p. gingivalis were restricted to microcolonies. c. rectus occurred dispersed, but here and there also in microcolonies. images from transmission electron microscopy  show the predominance of various cocci and short rods  interspersed by prominent elongated fusiform cells  .

the in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm induces apoptosis in hgec
hgec in 6-well plates were challenged with biofilms attached to a hydroxyapatite  disc for  <dig> and  <dig> h using the experimental setup described in fig. 3a. apoptosis was detected by the tunel assay. biofilm-challenged hgec exhibited signs of apoptosis early during challenge . after only  <dig> h approximately 75% of the cells showed blebbing and pyknotic nuclei and stained positive for tunel. at  <dig> h more than 85% of the hgec were apoptotic .

biofilm-challenged hgec elicit a cytokine response that is reduced over time
hgec were challenged with 'subgingival' biofilms for  <dig> and  <dig> h. at  <dig> h, the primary  and secondary cytokine  and chemokine  responses were significantly elevated . at  <dig> h, however, the level of all cytokines had subsided significantly. to test our hypothesis that this decline of cytokine levels is due to biofilm-mediated degradation, supernatant from hgec, pre-challenged with heat-killed planktonic p. gingivalis atcc  <dig> for establishing cytokine production, was incubated either with biofilms on ha discs, filtered supernatant from  <dig>  h biofilm cultures, or with ksfm medium in which biofilms had been incubated for  <dig> h . assays performed after  <dig> min,  <dig> min,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h of exposure to the biofilm showed that il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> degradation began immediately and progressively increased to reach approximately 25% after  <dig> h . when filtered biofilm culture supernatant or ksfm were tested, il- <dig> and il- <dig> degradation was not observed, while the rate of il-1β degradation was significantly reduced up to  <dig> h but eventually reached levels similar to that induced by the biofilm at  <dig> h. this suggests that the presence of biofilm bacteria is necessary for il- <dig> and il- <dig> degradation, while il-1β is more susceptible to degradation by a soluble component of the biofilm culture.

discussion
we demonstrated that biofilms mimicking subgingival plaque can be established reproducibly in vitro. when exposed in co-culture to primary human epithelial cells, they induce cell apopotosis and production of pro-inflammatory primary and secondary cytokines. we further showed that the cytokines produced are immediately attacked by the biofilm. thus, this co-culture model opposing a multi-species 'subgingival' biofilm to human oral epithelial cells mirrors two key aspects of the interactions taking place at the dental plaque:periodontal tissue interphase, namely the triggering of a strong pro-inflammatory host cell response and the simultaneous microbial subversion of host defense mechanisms. our strategy to construct in vitro 'subgingival' biofilms makes use of the well-characterized 'supragingival' zürich biofilm model  <cit>  made up of six species, which in vivo colonize preferentially at the tooth surface and at the gingival margin. by eliminating streptococcus mutans/sobinus and candida albicans, and addingthe putative periodontal pathogens c. rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, we assembled a consortium of microorganisms that much more mirrors subgingival plaque. streptococcus intermedius completes the biofilm consortium, being a subgingival species also known for its association with dental implant infections, pyogenic infections, endocarditis, and various types of abscesses  <cit> . a second strategic aim was to move our in vitro 'subgingival' biofilms from strictly anaerobic to aerobic atmospheric conditions that match those used to propagate mammalian cells. if successful, this would be a major advance towards combining two in vitro model systems that basically seem to exclude each other. our data show that biofilm adaptation to 5% o <dig> is feasible. they further show that the colonization reproducibility is not yet completely satisfactory as far as the most fastidious and most oxygen- sensitive species p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia are concerned . this indicates that oxygen consumption by the microbial consortium - creating a low reduction potential - can be somewhat variable among parallel biofilms. preliminary evidence suggests that later exposure of biofilms to oxygen  does not improve the growth of the subgingival anaerobes  and does not significantly reduce their viability either. the duration of the exposure to aerobic conditions had remarkably little effect on the ratios between the bacteria within the community .

we used fish, and in part indirect if, in addition to quantitative culture for monitoring biofilm composition. our data demonstrate the importance of using one or two complementary techniques, as any single technique may fail under particular circumstances. examples in this study are the consistently reliable enumeration of f. nucleatum subsp. vincentii by fish but not by culture due to difficulties in optimizing the f. nucleatum culture medium . clsm of biofilms stained simultaneously for multiple bacterial species by multiplex fish revealed a remarkable biofilm thickness of approximately  <dig> μm and provided preliminary evidence for microcolony formation by several biofilm organisms which is reminiscent of microcolonies found characteristically in subgingival plaques from deep progressed periodontal pockets. primary hgec challenged with such 'subgingival' biofilms were able to induce a cytokine response after  <dig> h of challenge  and although this is not strictly comparable because we did not perform comprehensive side by side comparisons, the cytokine response was higher than the previously reported cytokine response elicited by single planktonic bacterial species  <cit> . however, when the exposure time was prolonged to  <dig> h, the level of all cytokines had diminished significantly. we tested the hypothesis that the cytokine levels are reduced due to extracellular biofilm-mediated degradation. in fact, il- <dig>  and il- <dig> degradation began immediately and progressively increased to reach approximately 25% after  <dig> h of exposure, but only in the presence of intact biofilm. this suggests that the presence of biofilm bacteria is necessary for il- <dig> and il- <dig> degradation, while il-1β was found to be more susceptible to degradation by a soluble component in the biofilm culture medium. biofilm-induced cytokine degradation could be, at least in part, due to the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis or a protease of t. forsythia with similar trypsin-like activity. previous studies have shown that p. gingivalis can induce cytokine degradation  <cit>  that is mainly lysine-gingipain-dependent. the lower rate of the biofilm-induced cytokine degradation observed in the present study compared to that induced by p. gingivalis monocultures  <cit>  is possibly dose-related. plaque mediated cytokine degradation is a potential mechanism to explain the reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines  and chemokines  found in the gcf of patients with periodontitis  <cit> , as well as the gcf from sites with active periodontal disease or unresolved defects following treatment  <cit> . in addition to cytokine production, primary hgec challenged in vitro with a 'subgingival' biofilm exhibited apoptosis as evidenced by dna fragmentation, the hallmark of apoptosis. this is a potential mechanism to explain the apoptosis that is observed in the gingiva at sites of chronic bacteria-induced inflammation  <cit> , particularly among the superficial cells of the junctional epithelium  <cit>  and the fibroblasts and leucocytes of the connective tissue  <cit> . the high proportions of hgec undergoing apoptosis in the described co-culture system, as well as the short exposure time that is necessary for the initiation of the apoptotic process, suggest that the in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm is a highly pathogenic entity, and possibly more pathogenic than single bacterial strains.

CONCLUSIONS
our approach allowed us to directy link primary human gingival epithelial cells, being an integral part of the oral innate immune system, to an artificial, in vitro propagated 'subgingival' biofilm, and elicit various cell responses ranging from cytokine production to apoptosis. our data indicate that, compared to responses triggered by planktonic individual species, the bacteria organized in an in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm express even more damaging virulence factors neutralizing the host cells' pro-inflammatory defense. as neither the culturing of host defense cells nor the assembly of artificial biofilms is restricted to oral tissues and bacteria, the same strategy of challenging cultured host cells with in vitro propagated bacterial biofilms may be of general interest and could be applied to study other elusive chronic inflammatory diseases.
