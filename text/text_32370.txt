BACKGROUND
microtubules  are hollow tubular structures formed by non-covalent bonds between  <dig> tubulin proto-fibrils. these 22–25 nm diameter proto-fibrils are composed of α-tubulin and β-tubulin heterodimers concatenated end-to-end. γ-tubulin, which is not a structural component of microtubules, guides the tubulin dimer during mt assembly. some mt structures are relatively stable due to the role of mt binding proteins and enzyme modifications. in many physiological activities, mts regulate their own dynamic changes through microtubule-associated proteins . maps are also involved in other mt functions, such as maintenance of cell morphology and structure, participation in cytoplasmic streaming, membrane transport, determining the position of the organelles, regulation of signal transduction, controlling cell polarity growth, cell wall construction and so on .

maps are a class of proteins that specifically bind to the mt cytoskeleton and modulate their dynamic assembly processes and structures, thereby affecting their function. compared to the maps in animal systems, research on plant maps started later. it was not until the 1980’s that first plant maps were discovered and their cellular functions were analysed. the maps contain at least one outwardly prominent structural domain which stretches out to mts and interacts with other cell components . in recent years, a number of new functional studies on plant maps have been reported, such as map <dig>  map <dig> and map <dig>  map <dig> etc. . these results showed that the plant maps can regulate plant mt dynamics and organization, as well as the connection between mts and other cellular structures, thereby playing a role in plant cell morphology and differentiation, plant growth and development, adaptation to diverse physiological processes . all these important biological roles mean that maps and how they regulate the mt activity is a focus of considerable current research.

tpx <dig> family proteins have a highly conserved tpx <dig> domain  which was first found in a kinesin like protein, targeting protein for xklp <dig>  from xenopus laevis. the primary structure of tpx <dig> is conserved among vertebrates and higher plants. recently, studies have reported that several plant tpx <dig> family proteins, such as tpx <dig>  wave dampened  <dig> , wave dampened  <dig> like   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and map <dig>  take part in plant development . in plants, tpx <dig> has two aurora binding domains, two nuclear localization signal  motifs, a nuclear export signal  motif, a tpx2-importin domain , a tpx <dig> domain , a coiled-coil domain and two mt binding regions  <cit> . the tpx <dig> n-terminal aurora binding domains allow tpx <dig> to bind aurora kinases and regulates spindle formation, while the c terminus binds microtubules and affects cell division  <cit> . tpx <dig> is a new spindle component protein in vertebrates. it distributes to the core of cells in the s and g <dig> phase of the cell cycle and plays an important role in the process of mitotic spindle formation. during interphase, tpx <dig> is localized to the nucleus, and in the g0/m phase, the nuclear envelope breakdown leads to the release of tpx <dig> and the start of spindle assembly during prophase. during mitosis, tpx <dig> is localized to the spindle microtubules, and in late anaphase it is completely degraded  <cit> . in the ran gtpase complex, tpx <dig> is released from the importin complex, interacts with aurora kinases and combines with microtubules, and controls the cell division  <cit> .

atwvd <dig> is a conserved, highly hydrophilic protein  <cit>  which can interact with microtubules to promote mt bundling. atwvd <dig> plays an important role in polar cell elongation. the roots and etiolated hypocotyls of plants overexpressing wvd <dig> displayed twisting in a right handed helical manner, but rosette leaf petioles twisted in opposite direction  <cit> . these helical twisted growth phenotypes may result from an interplay between cortical microtubules and cellulose microfibrils. moreover, the loss of anisotropic cell elongation results in the generation of short and robust organs. in addition, the arrangement of cortical microtubules in the root epidermal cells of these plants is also changed  <cit> . arabidopsis wdl <dig>  another tpx <dig> family member, functions in hypocotyl cell elongation in response to light via an ubiquitin-26s proteasome–dependent pathway. atwdl <dig> overexpression and an rnai downregulated line showed shorter and longer hypocotyl cells than wild type, respectively  <cit> . arabidopsis wdl <dig> as a microtubule-stabilizing protein is involved in ethylene mediated etiolated hypocotyl cell elongation by altering the organization and stability of cortical microtubules  <cit> .

apart from a role in root development, tpx <dig> protein family members also function in cell wall biosynthesis. hybrid aspen  map <dig>  was identified as being abundant in secondary cell wall forming woody tissues. pttmap <dig> was shown to bind the cellulose inhibiting drug  <dig> -dichlorobenzonitrile , implying its importance for cellulose biosynthesis in the secondary cell walls. overexpression of map <dig> resulted in right handed helical twisting of epidermal cells and cotyledon petioles  <cit> .

given the important roles of tpx <dig> family proteins in plant development, a phylogenetic analysis of tpx <dig> family proteins from a large number of plant species is valuable. in this study, we report global phylogenetic analysis of plant tpx <dig> proteins and their classification into  <dig> groups. we also discuss  <dig> members of the tpx <dig> family in eucalyptus grandis, as well as their expression profiling in six different tissues. the eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes exhibited diverse expression patterns, suggesting their functional divergence. we also carried out preliminary functional analysis of selected eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes. our results provide the basis for further investigation into the roles of these candidate genes in cell division, growth and development of eucalyptus.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis of plant tpx <dig> family proteins
to identify putative plant tpx <dig> family proteins, the conserved tpx <dig>  domains were searched from the pfam database. the database currently holds a total of  <dig> sequences from  <dig> species. based on the presence of other domains, these sequences can be classified into  <dig> different domain architectures . we extracted all  <dig> sequences from pfam database and identified that  <dig> of these sequences were from  <dig> different species of plants  . these sequences include multiple splice variants for different genes. the plant tpx <dig> sequences were aligned using clustalx <dig>  and a phylogenetic tree was produced .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship among plant tpx <dig> proteins. a total of  <dig> protein sequences were identified by pfam containing the tpx <dig> domain . of these,  <dig> sequences were plant  sequences. the plant sequences were aligned using clustalx <dig>  and a bootstrapped neighbour joining tree was constructed. six main clades were identified  and named after the arabidopsis members in each clade. some sequences which fall between clades  were not used for the domain analysis in fig.  <dig>  these sequences still contain the tpx <dig> domain




the phylogenetic tree reveals  <dig> main clades. clade  <dig> contains map <dig>  the protein first reported from wood forming tissues of populus  <cit>  and its homologues from different plant species  <cit> . clade  <dig> does not contain any protein that has been previously described. since these are closest to map <dig> clade, we name this clade as map20l. however, it should be considered that these proteins are much larger than map <dig> . clade  <dig> contains the best studied plant tpx <dig> protein, the attpx <dig>  <cit> . clades 4– <dig> contain wvd <dig> and wdl proteins  <cit> . some of the sequences fell in between the clades. while these sequences contain the tpx <dig> domain and are mostly from lower plants, these are sufficiently different to produce large insertions in the global alignment of plant tpx <dig> proteins. hence, for some of the analyses presented here, these sequences were not used. a full list of number of sequences in each clade is presented on additional file 3: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> overall structure of plant tpx <dig> proteins. an alignment of tpx <dig> proteins from all  <dig> clades  described in fig.  <dig> was used to show the overall size and structure of the proteins. the alignment was coloured in aliview to show physiochemical properties of the amino acids. a and b both show the same alignment coloured to highlight either all amino acids  or majority rule consensus residues 




a global alignment of plant tpx <dig> proteins from  <dig> main clades  reveals that the clade  <dig>  proteins are the smallest of the tpx <dig> proteins while the clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig>  are the largest. proteins in clades 4– <dig>  are of intermediate size. an analysis of sequence conservation across various clades  reveals that there is little or no sequence conservation among the proteins outside of the tpx <dig> domain. it is likely that members of different clades would serve different functions. they all contain the tpx <dig> domain which has been shown to bind the microtubules  <cit> . it is likely these proteins will bind to microtubules and at the same time interact with other proteins to play an important role in a variety of plant developmental processes involving in a role for microtubules.

an analysis of extracted tpx <dig> domains from all plant tpx <dig> proteins reveals that there are some differences in the sequences between the different clades. the most apparent of these differences is the presence of a kleek motif in the clades 4– <dig>  this motif is absent in proteins from clades 1– <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis plant tpx <dig> domains. the plant  tpx <dig> proteins  were categorised into  <dig> main groups. an alignment of the tpx <dig> domain  sequences was then obtained from pfam database. tpx <dig> domain sequences for each individual clade were fed into the online server weblogo to create the sequence logos to highlight the conserved residues for each group




in the pfam database, there were  <dig> sequences from arabidopsis  and  <dig> sequences from eucalyptus . since these sequence sets include the splice variants, the fully sequenced genomes available at phytozome were scanned to identify  <dig> tpx <dig> loci in arabidopsis and  <dig> loci in eucalyptus . the eucalyptus proteins were named based on known arabidopsis homologues. a similar nomenclature approach has been used previously for cesa proteins  <cit> . the final list of eucalyptus loci included egmap <dig> , egmap20l ; egtpx <dig> ; egwdl <dig>  egwdl <dig> and egwdl3l ; egwdl <dig>  egwdl <dig> and egwdl <dig>  and egwdl <dig>  egwdl <dig> and egwdl8l .

genetic properties of eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes
the eucalyptus tpx <dig> family gene structures were compared using online software gsds  <dig>   <cit> . the core tpx <dig> domain is usually spread across three exons in all eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes, which are followed by another exon downstream . egmap <dig> is the smallest of the  <dig> eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes and has only one more exon on the 5′ side of the tpx <dig> domain. egmap20l on the other hand has four exons upstream of tpx <dig> domain, making a total of  <dig> exons for this gene. egtpx <dig> is the largest of the  <dig> genes and comprises of a total of  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns. the remaining genes,  <dig> wdl genes, have between  <dig> and  <dig> exons upstream of the tpx domain making a total of 6– <dig> exons in these genes .fig.  <dig> genetic properties of eucalyptus tpx <dig> proteins. a exon/intron structures of eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes. green boxes represent the cds regions while the blue boxes represent the untranslated regions. introns are indicated by black lines. location of the tpx <dig> domain is indicated in pink. the sizes of exons and introns can be estimated using the scale at bottom. b chromosomal locations of eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes. tandem duplications were connected by dashed red dotted lines. non-tandem duplications were connected by blue dotted lines




modern plant genome diversity has evolved via gene deletions, small-scale duplications, partial rearrangements and large chromosomal fragment duplications, which significantly impacted the expansion in gene family members  <cit> . the  <dig> eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes showed random distribution along eucalyptus chromosomes on the basis of the chromosome information provided by phytozome . the  <dig> tpx <dig> family genes are distributed on  <dig> of the  <dig> eucalyptus chromosomes . based on the phylogenetic tree, we linked  <dig> pairs of the paralogous tpx <dig> family genes . egwdl5/egwdl <dig> and egwdl3/egwdl3l are the tandem duplication pairs on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. however the paralogous duplication pairs, egmap20/egmap20l and egwdl8/egwdl8l are located on chromosomes 10/ <dig> and 10/ <dig> respectively . the conservation and micro-colinearity of egtpx <dig> family genes show symbiotic evolution and suggest a common origin of these genes. together, the diverse duplication events contributed to the complexity of tpx <dig> gene family in the eucalyptus genome.

the synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates ratios  were used to analyse the tpx <dig> gene pairs. the synonymous substitutions do not change the amino acid sequence and are subjected to a lower selection pressure. on the other hand, non-synonymous substitutions change the amino acid sequence which might lead to harmful mutations and hence are under a higher selection pressure. when ka/ks is close to  <dig>  it indicates evolution under neutral selection. a ka/ks ratio of <  <dig> indicates that those genes undergo a purifying  selection while ka/ks >  <dig> at specific sites indicates genes that are under positive selection. in most cases, the ka/ks ratio is less than  <dig> due to the purifying selection. however, when the diversifying selection exists, the ka/ks of the allele will increase, even significantly higher than  <dig>  <cit> . additional file 5: table s <dig> shows that the ka/ks ratios of all  <dig> duplicated pairs were all less than  <dig> , indicating purifying selection.

functional analysis of eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes
expression analysis of tpx <dig> family genes in eucalyptus
the expression patterns of genes can provide useful clues to their function. to identify the expression patterns of tpx <dig> family genes in plants,  <dig> different tissues of eucalyptus grandis - shoot tips , young leaves , mature leaves , phloem , xylem , roots ) were analysed by quantitative rt-pcr . in general, expression of egwdl <dig> was the highest among the eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes followed by egwdl <dig> and egtpx <dig>  all other genes were expressed at comparatively lower levels.fig.  <dig> expression analysis of eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes in different tissues. a expression of all  <dig> eucalyptus tpx <dig> family genes was quantified by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  in vegetative tissues . the average expression of each gene was calculated relatively to the first biological replicate of roots ± standard error  . b relative expression of each eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes was normalised to its highest expression across various tissues. this will make the highest level of each gene as 1




to compare relative expression levels of each gene across multiple tissues, we calculated the normalised expression values for each gene . seven out of  <dig> eucalyptus genes  had highest expression in roots. egmap20l and egtpx <dig> had highest levels in young leaves while egwdl <dig> and egwdl8l had highest levels in mature leaves. while the expression of egwdl <dig> was the highest in the shoot tips and young leaves . the observation that most of tpx <dig> genes had their highest levels in root indicated that they may be functionally important in root development.

subcellular localization of eucalyptus tpx <dig> proteins
despite their variable domain structures and expression patterns, one common feature of tpx <dig> family proteins is that they are all likely to be maps and have mt binding activity. to investigate their mt binding ability in vivo, we examined the subcellular localization of a selection of eucalyptus tpx <dig> proteins. coding sequences  of egmap <dig>  egwdl <dig> and egwdl3l were fused to c-terminal yellow florescence protein  tags  and the constructs were transiently expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells. confocal microscopy observations of the egmap20-yfp, egwdl3-yfp and egwdl3l-yfp florescence signals form net-like structures throughout the cell  indicating that these proteins are all distributed along the mt cytoskeleton. previously, poplar pttmap20-yfp has been shown to distribute along microtubules  <cit> . in addition, pttmap <dig> was strongly up-regulated during secondary cell wall synthesis in hybrid aspen and tightly co-regulated with cesa genes  <cit> . wvd <dig>  wdl <dig> and wdl <dig> have also been localized to cortical microtubules  <cit> . tpx <dig> has been shown to localize to the cortical microtubules in interphase, and it may decorate other mt arrays during other stages of plant cell division   <cit> . tpx <dig> family proteins contain a conserved mt binding domain, the tpx <dig> domain, which plays an important role in the organization of the mt arrays, cell growth and the regulation of cell division  <cit> . taken together, previous studies and our own observations suggest that egmap <dig>  egwdl <dig> and egwdl3l are mt binding proteins like their homologues from populus and arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> subcellular localizations of three eucalyptus tpx <dig> family proteins. confocal images of tobacco epidermal leaf cells expressing egmap20-yfp , egwdl3-yfp  and egwdl3l-yfp . scale bar = 20 μm




phenotypic observation of transgenic plants
egmap <dig> overexpression in arabidopsis leads to organ twisting
to understand the effect of the tpx <dig> family proteins on plant growth and development, p35s:egmap <dig> overexpressing transgenic arabidopsis plants were analysed. the cotyledons of 12-day-old seedlings overexpressing egmap <dig> developed left/right handed twisting of epidermal cells while etiolated hypocotyls of 3-days-old seedlings showed right/left-handed twist .fig.  <dig> phenotypic analysis of transgenic lines of arabidopsis overexpressing egmap <dig>  a-c, 12-day-old wild-type  and transgenic oe-egmap <dig>  arabidopsis seedlings are shown. the latter showing right-handed  or left-handed  twisting of cotyledon petioles. d-f, etiolated hypocotyls from 3-day-old wild-type  and two independent overexpressing egmap <dig> lines . helical right-handed  or left-handed  twisting of epidermal cells was observed in the two transgenic lines




similar twisting phenotypes with overexpression of tpx <dig> proteins from other species have been reported previously. overexpressing pttmap <dig> in arabidopsis caused cotyledon petioles with left-handed helical twisting and hypocotyl epidermal cells with a right-handed helical twist  <cit> . overexpression of mt bundling proteins, wvd <dig> and wdl <dig> in arabidopsis led to a right hand deviation of roots and left hand skewing of cotyledon petioles  <cit>  but left-handed twisting of the rosette leaves. during organ twisting, the anisotropy of cell elongation is lost, leading to generation of short and robust cells. in addition, cortical mt arrays of root epidermal cells are also changed  <cit> . overexpression of tpx <dig> caused the random organization of cortical microtubules and root right handed shift  <cit> . however, overexpression of the mt depolymerising protein map <dig> produced a left handed twist of hypocotyl epidermal cells  <cit> .

the growth of plant cells involves an increase in cell volume, which can be achieved by cell expansion or elongation. both of these two processes occur in a specific area of the cell surface causing the changes in cell morphology. three kinds of mt arrays participating in cell morphogenesis exist in plants, including cortical mts, preprophase bands and phragmoplast mts. the cortical mts during interphase are involved in controlling the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall and thereby determining the direction of cell elongation  <cit> . it is plausible that map <dig> plays a role in cell elongation leading to directional skewing. to understand why cotyledon and hypocotyl cells of egmap <dig> overexpression plants are sometimes left/right spiral, further experiments are needed.

egwdl3l overexpression in arabidopsis affects growth
the over-expression  of egwdl3l in arabidopsis on the other hand did not lead to any helical twisting. there was no difference between the wild type and egwdl3l oe lines grown in dark. however, the hypocotyls were shorter for the light grown seedlings . previous studies have shown that atwdl <dig> is a negative regulator of the hypocotyl cell elongation and acts in a light dependent manner. in light, atwdl <dig> is relatively stable and promotes mts to form a longitudinal arrangement, thereby inhibiting hypocotyl cell elongation. however, in the dark, atwdl <dig> is degraded via the 26s proteasome pathway, thereby removing inhibition of hypocotyl cell elongation  <cit> . since egwdl3l and atwdl <dig> are closely related and are both part of clade  <dig>  egwdl3l like atwdl <dig> may also be a negative regulator of cell elongation.fig.  <dig> effect of egwdl3l on the hypocotyl cell elongation. a and b the hypocotyl length of the seedlings grown under light. **p <  <dig>  with t-test, n > <dig>  error bars represent the mean ± sd. c and d etiolated hypocotyl length. n > <dig>  error bars represent the mean ± sd




CONCLUSIONS
we performed a comprehensive analysis of phylogeny of plant tpx <dig> proteins from the pfam database. expression analysis of  <dig> eucalyptus tpx <dig> genes suggested that most of tpx <dig> genes might mainly be functionally important during root development. furthermore, overexpression of egmap <dig> and egwdl3l leads to a range of twisting phenotypes that are indicative of modulation of mt arrays and hence suggests that these proteins are indeed maps. maps modulate a variety of developmental activity in plants and previous studies have shown that members of tpx <dig> family are involved in multiple processes in plant development, including root development, embryogenesis and formation of secondary cell walls. this research forms an important foundation for further investigations into the role of tpx <dig> proteins in eucalyptus growth and development.
