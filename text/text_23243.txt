BACKGROUND
rusts are among the most economically important and widespread diseases of wheat worldwide. yellow  rust, caused by puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , is predominantly found in temperate regions and propagates mainly through asexual urediniospores produced in uredia on the leaf surface. pst is becoming more prevalent, possibly due to the evolution of more aggressive isolates which have evolved to tolerate higher temperatures  <cit> . in parallel, several major sources of wheat resistance to pst have broken down in recent years. these developments hasten the need to identify more effective and durable sources of resistance.

pst urediniospores germinate on the wheat leaf surface, forming a germ tube that enters the plant through stomata. once inside, a sub-stomatal vesicle  is formed within the stomatal cavity from which infection hyphae form. a haustorial mother cell is formed at the end of each infection hypha upon contact with a plant mesophyll cell. an infection peg breaches the plant cell wall forming a fungal feeding structure, known as a haustorium, within the cell. further hyphae develop from the infection hyphae and proliferate throughout the leaf  <cit> . approximately two weeks after the pathogen has entered the plant, visible symptoms can be seen in susceptible reactions as raised pustules, known as uredia forming on the leaf surface.

the effect of temperature on the performance of resistance genes is well-documented. several quantitative disease resistance  genes, conferring enhanced resistance to pst at either high or low temperatures, have been identified in wheat  <cit> . qdr is often described as adult plant or partial resistance, or as ‘slow rusting’. the effect of temperature on yellow rust resistance genes is well-known . seedlings of wheat cultivars with high temperature adult plant  resistance are susceptible to all races of pst at high and low temperatures. adult plants of htap resistance cultivars are susceptible at low temperatures, but resistant at high temperatures. yellow rust resistance genes yr <dig> and yr <dig> were originally designated as htap genes because exposure to higher temperatures was essential for their function at later plant growth stages  <cit> . however, yr <dig> was later shown to confer temperature-dependent resistance at all growth stages when exposed to temperatures over 25°c  <cit> . in contrast to htap genes, leaf rust resistance conferred by lr34/yr <dig> is enhanced at lower temperatures  <cit> . lr34/yr <dig> is a well-established resistance, being present in many wheat cultivars and occupying more than  <dig> million hectares in developing countries  <cit> , whereas yr <dig> has more recently been introduced into many varieties worldwide through the introgression of the closely linked gpc-b <dig> gene  <cit> . in addition, several wheat cultivars have been identified as containing un-characterised yellow rust temperature–responsive resistance genes, suggesting that such genes are widely deployed in agriculture  <cit> .

plants have several layers of defence that provide protection against invading microbes. plants recognise conserved microbial elicitors, known as pathogen -associated molecular patterns , through pattern recognition receptors , initiating pamp-triggered immunity . pti activates inducible defences, including cell wall reinforcement, production of antimicrobial compounds and stomatal closure which are sufficient to repel or deter most invading microbes  <cit> . virulent pathogens have evolved to suppress pti, producing effector proteins that interfere with prr function or downstream signalling components. another layer of defence is provided by resistance  proteins that detect these effector proteins initiating effector-triggered immunity , a type of resistance typified by the hypersensitive response  associated with host cell death  <cit> . most r genes are predicted to encode proteins with nucleotide-binding site  and leucine-rich repeat  domains involved in effector recognition. however, cloning of the qdr genes yr <dig> and lr <dig> has revealed that these genes do not belong to the major nbr-lrr class of genes, suggesting that the mechanisms of resistances conferred by these genes could be fundamentally different from those of r genes  <cit> .

at present, the basis for temperature-responsive resistance is poorly understood  <cit> . in this study, we investigate temperature-sensitivity in the wheat-yellow rust pathosystem using near isogenic lines  of the hexaploid wheat breeding line uc <dig> +/- yr <dig>  plants were grown under two temperature regimes which were maintained at 12°c during the dark period and 18°c or 25°c during the light period . after inoculation, plants were either kept at the original temperatures they were grown under or transferred to the other temperature regime. our findings reveal previously uncharacterised background sensitivity to temperature changes in uc <dig> that acts independently of yr <dig>  defence against pst in adult uc1041-yr <dig> was affected by a temperature change in both directions and this effect was consistent in plants transferred up to 8 days prior to inoculation. enhanced resistance when plants experienced an increase in temperature was observed in seedlings, and manifested as reduced hyphal colonisation compared to seedlings maintained at cooler day temperatures. we also show that this temperature sensitivity is genotype-dependent in wheat seedlings. our work highlights the importance of temperature changes, rather than defined thresholds, when characterising disease resistance mechanisms in wheat. the results have potential to inform breeding strategies for the creation of wheat cultivars with more environmentally stable pst resistance.

RESULTS
a decrease in day temperature diminishes resistance to pst independently of yr36
yr <dig> conferred near-complete resistance in adult plants of uc1041 + yr <dig> when plants were maintained in either the 12°c/18°c or the 12°c/25°c temperature regimes pre and post inoculation. however, yr36-mediated resistance was significantly reduced in plants originally grown at 12°c/25°c and then transferred, post-inoculation to 12°c/18°c, uredia coverage being significantly higher . as expected, uc <dig> -yr <dig> plants were less resistant than uc1041 + yr <dig>  and there were no significant differences in disease levels between plants which were maintained at 12°c/18°c or 12°c/25°c pre and post-inoculation . however, resistance in uc <dig> –yr <dig> was also significantly reduced when adult plants were transferred from the 12°c/25°c to 12°c/18°c regime following inoculation, with leaf uredia coverage increasing up to two fold . changing temperatures therefore affects resistance in both uc <dig> nils independent of the presence of yr <dig> 

a change in temperature affects pst resistance up to 8 days pre-inoculation in uc1041
initial observations with the uc <dig> +/-yr <dig> nils led us to further characterise the temperature-responsive pst resistance of the uc <dig> background. as previously observed, there was no significant difference in percentage uredia coverage of plants maintained pre and post inoculation at 12°c/18°c or 12°c/25°c , whilst plants transferred from the higher to the lower temperature regime were less resistant . conversely, plants grown at 12°c/18°c and then transferred to 12°c/25°c post inoculation were more resistant, with significantly lower uredia levels . the extent of pst colonisation varied between each of the three experiments, although similar amounts of spores were applied. nevertheless, the trend in adult uc <dig> -yr <dig> plants remained consistent in each experiment, with temperature decreases diminishing resistance and temperature increases resulting in enhanced resistance. uc <dig> resistance can respond differently at 12°c/18°c and 12°c/25°c. at 12°c/25°c the uredia are surrounded by necrotic tissue , indicative of a cell death/hypersensitive response . the uredia are often surrounded by chlorotic tissue, the hr being weak. the shift from 12°c/18°c to 12°c/25°c may trigger a cell death response and result in a retardation of uredia formation.

similar experiments were performed with adult plants transferred from one temperature regime to the other up to 8 days before inoculation. there were no significant differences in the reduced uredia levels between plants transferred from 12°c/18°c to 12°c/25°c at the time of inoculation compared to those transferred  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 8 days prior to inoculation . similarly, adult plants transferred from 12°c/25°c to 12°c/18°c had comparable increased numbers of uredia regardless of whether they were transferred at the time of inoculation or  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 8 days before inoculation .

a decrease in day temperature affects later stages of pst colonisation in uc <dig> seedlings
further investigations were performed on seedlings to determine whether the temperature-change effects were influenced by the developmental stage of the host. no pst resistance was observed in seedlings of uc <dig> –yr <dig> infected with isolate 08/ <dig>  resulting in higher levels of pst uredia than seen on adult plants. as in adult uc <dig> plants, there were no significant differences in disease levels between plants which were maintained at either 12°c/18°c or 12°c/25°c pre and post-inoculation . as in adult plants, enhanced resistance was observed when seedlings were transferred from 12°c/18°c to12°c/25°c . however, there was no significant difference in uredia levels between plants maintained at 12°c/25°c and plants transferred from 12°c/25°c to 12°c/18°c after pst inoculation, contrary to the reduced resistance observed in adults plants.

pst development and colonisation was observed microscopically in uc <dig> seedlings exhibiting enhanced resistance resulting from the transfer to the higher temperature. there were no significant differences in the percentage of germinated urediniospores between the four temperature treatments at both  <dig> dpi  and  <dig> dpi . similarly, there were no significant differences in the percentage of germinated urediniospores forming ssvs between the four temperature regimes at either 1 dpi or 3 dpi . at 6 dpi seedlings grown at 12°c/25°c and then transferred to 12°c/18°c post inoculation had significantly smaller internal fungal structures  compared to all other treatments . by 8 dpi, hyphal colonisation was less in seedlings grown at 12°c/18°c pre inoculation compared to those grown at 12°c/25°c, regardless of the subsequent temperature change . as expected, seedlings grown at 12°c/18°c and then transferred to the higher temperature regime after pst inoculation showed significantly less hyphal colonisation compared to seedlings maintained at 12°c/18°c . hyphal growth in seedlings maintained at 12°c/25°c did not differ significantly from seedlings transferred from 12°c/25°c to 12°c/18°c after inoculation .

effect of temperature change on pst resistance in wheat cultivars is genotype-dependent
to determine whether temperature changes induce resistance to pst in other wheat cultivars the same experimental procedures were carried out on seedlings of selected uk elite cultivars. resistance to pst isolate 08/ <dig> in shamrock displayed a similar phenotype to uc <dig>  with seedlings that were transferred from lower to higher temperatures displaying a significant reduction in uredia levels . however, resistance in solstice was not affected by transferring between temperature regimes, as disease levels did not differ significantly between all four treatments . as in uc <dig> seedlings, resistance enhancement in shamrock was not consistent. when seedlings were transferred from 12°c/18°c to 12°c/25°c enhanced resistance was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments.

discussion
our investigations show that yr <dig> confers almost complete resistance to pst isolate 08/ <dig> at 25°c, consistent with previous studies. we also show that yr <dig> is effective at 18°c, refining the lower range of temperature at which resistance is conferred. in addition, we discovered that the uc <dig> genetic background responds to changes in temperature independently of yr <dig>  affecting growth of pst. our results suggest that yr36-mediated resistance may be affected by a previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity which is present in the uc1041background. in the field, yr <dig> conveys a qdr phenotype on adult plants when grown in mediterranean environments  <cit> . based on the results presented here, frequent temperature changes could be influencing the qdr observed for uc1041 + yr <dig> in the field. furthermore, our results also suggest that yr36-mediated resistance should be effective in the field under relatively cooler temperate conditions.

several studies characterising temperature-responsive resistance genes have been performed using different pre and post inoculation conditions, but the effect of temperature change has rarely been considered. yet under natural conditions, temperatures are constantly changing and the effect of this on resistance needs further investigation. it is possible that other temperature-responsive resistance genes may respond to changes in temperature in a similar way to that seen in uc <dig> +/- yr <dig>  rather than only requiring exposure to a temperature threshold  <cit> . for example, a study by broers and wallenburg  <cit>  observed that a decrease in temperature increases lr34/yr <dig> resistance to leaf rust, although in this study there was no negative control treatment involving plants not exposed to the temperature change. pretorius et al <cit>  later point out that the broers and wallenburg  <cit>  study does not exclude background effects from the cultivars in which the lr34/yr <dig> gene resided. our findings highlight the importance of a change in temperature regime in pathology studies and especially when characterising temperature-responsive resistance genes.

adult plant tests are the most appropriate methods for evaluating resistance, but limit the number experiments that can be performed. although seedling tests enable more rapid screening and testing of resistance, our results reveal that results are less reliable than with adult plants. studies with uc <dig> seedlings revealed that a temperature increase can enhance resistance to pst at an early stage of plant development. although the results are less consistent than those observed in adult plants, the results suggest that the effect of temperature changes may not be only due to previously uncharacterised apr resistance in the uc <dig> background. also in seedlings, a decrease in temperature does not reduce resistance to pst as seen in adult plants of uc <dig> , but this could be due to the higher levels of pst infection seen on uc <dig> seedlings . differences between adult plants and seedlings could be caused by pst inoculum levels, or reflect physiological differences influencing defence, considering some types of resistance cannot be detected until later developmental stages  <cit> . as in uc <dig>  the enhanced resistance observed in shamrock was not seen in all seedling experiments. when the phenotype was not observed, uredia abundance was higher in both cultivars compared to experiments where a temperature effect was observed. this suggests that high levels of pst inoculum and subsequent heavy infection loads may mask the effect of the temperature change.

we show that pst is able to germinate and penetrate the plant successfully, regardless of the temperature-regime to which the plants have been exposed. this would suggest that the temperature-responsive resistance does not involve a mechanism dependent on the initial recognition of the pathogen. the phenotype observed when uc <dig> and shamrock plants were transferred from 12°c/18°c to 12°c/25°c resembles a type of qdr normally associated with decreased infection frequency, increased latency period, and reduced uredium size which generally only show signs of infection later in the growing season  <cit> . some aspects of this phenotype are seen with htap yellow rust resistance, which is a qdr generally effective after stem elongation and when day temperatures are 25°c –30°c  <cit> . however, the enhanced adult plant yellow rust resistance we observed was induced by an increase in temperature rather than prolonged exposure to 25°c, and was also observed in seedlings. our results therefore suggest that temperature changes, rather than exposure to a threshold temperature, could be influencing some qdr mechanisms.

plants must continuously adapt to changing environments, and balance resources between growth and defence to achieve maximum productivity  <cit> . studies in arabidopsis thaliana suggest a general trade-off mechanism whereby hormone-mediated growth may antagonise immune responses  <cit> . consequently, temperature changes may trigger reorganisation of energy supplies in some wheat cultivars, indirectly resulting in reduced nutrient availability to pst, a biotrophic fungus  <cit> . another possibility is that temperature changes could lead to the accumulation of pathogen-deterring metabolites  <cit> . although qdr mechanisms are largely unknown, lr <dig> and yr <dig> do not fall into the general nbs-lrr class of r genes, so it is reasonable to hypothesise that these are not generally involved in pathogen recognition. some qdr genes may have other functions that indirectly affect pathogen development when exposed to changes in temperature.

our results show that a change in temperature up to 8 days before inoculation affected defence against pst in uc <dig> adult plants. thus, pre-exposure to a different temperature regime affects subsequent defence, which suggests an adaptive response. we have no evidence that the temperature change is resulting in a stress response, but the lasting effect of increased or decreased resistance is comparable to priming, whereby previous exposure of plants to stress enables a faster response to subsequent stresses  <cit> . ambient temperature changes, similar to the ones used in this study, have been shown to cause adaptive change through epigenetic modification of dna activity by methylation  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that the corresponding temperature changes in wheat could also epigenetically prime plants, affecting later stages of defence, as seen in uc <dig> 

seedlings of shamrock demonstrated a similar resistance phenotype to uc <dig> when transferred to a higher temperature post-inoculation. however, resistance in solstice seedlings was not affected by a temperature change in either direction, indicating that the response is genotype-dependent and that some cultivars may have more stable defence against pst than others under varying temperatures. park et al <cit>  support these observations, reporting differences between wheat cultivars when challenged with pst at different pre and post inoculation temperature regimes. the authors attributed enhanced resistance at higher temperatures to factors that control adult plant resistance, such as uncharacterised qdr genes being present in the cultivars used in their study. if the basis for our observations is host adaptation to temperature changes, then other pathogen interactions may also be affected. a significant difference in resistance to changing temperatures was observed between wheat cultivars in response to blumeria graminis f. sp tritici, the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew, indicating that the phenomenon may not be restricted to yellow rust resistance  <cit> . understanding the effects of temperature changes on plant defence will be essential for developing crops that are more resilient to the potential impacts of climate change. consistent crop performance and reliable disease resistance are important traits in plant breeding. our results suggest an experimental approach to study the resistance response to changes in temperature. further investigation will reveal whether this trait interacts with other resistances, and if it can be used to select wheat cultivars with more consistent, temperature-stable resistance to pst and other diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
yr <dig> can prevent pst pustule development at temperatures sustained below 25°c which is contrary to what has previously been shown. in addition, a previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity was discovered in the uc <dig> background, revealing that changes in temperature can affect subsequent wheat resistance to yellow rust and may do so in a cultivar dependent manner. understanding how temperature changes affect resistance could enable the breeding of more stable pathogen resistance in crops.
