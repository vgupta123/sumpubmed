BACKGROUND
genetic maps based on molecular markers are a key step in marker-assisted selection  for plant breeding and for gene identification based on positional information  <cit> . discovery of novel genetic variation, enhanced selection techniques and the identification of genotypes with new or improved traits can lead to superior strains of interest. the density of the markers on a genetic map defines the map's resolution and the ability to introduce these traits using molecular means. new high-throughput technologies for the discovery of genetic markers and linkage analysis can enhance plant breeding efforts  <cit> .

in the last few years, genomic tools have begun to replace the traditional methods of molecular marker discovery. use of computational tools to search sequence information for molecular markers  <cit> , or genomic technologies such as whole-genome scanning , have enabled the discovery of thousands of markers in a single experiment  <cit> . these markers can be mapped to create high-density genetic maps or used directly for mas  <cit> . however, use of these types of technologies for plant breeding is still restricted, as many agricultural systems have a limited amount of genomic resources. furthermore, plant species contain wide genetic variation that cannot be explored by sequencing only one or two plants from each species.

one of the technologies that has been used for identification of genetic variation is single-feature polymorphism   <cit> . this approach is based on the concept that target dna that perfectly matches its probes binds with greater affinity than one with a mismatch. thus, natural imperfections can be detected as a difference in signal intensity in microarray hybridization using labeled genomic dna . sfps can be used, with no further information, as markers, or they can be sequenced to identify the genetic difference  or a small indel). sfp technology draws its strength from the fact that it can be implemented in a variety of genetic applications, such as marker discovery and fine mapping of traits, as well as for genome-wide association studies  <cit> . sfp discovery has been relatively successfully implemented in model organisms such as arabidobsis  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit> , and in non-model organisms such as rice and soybean  <cit> . to date, all hybridizations have been performed on high-density short oligonucleotides . these types of arrays are only available for a few organisms, they are expensive and they are not flexible in their design. therefore, the ability to implement this technology on any custom array  has the potential to create a very useful tool in many breeding programs for agricultural crops.

melon is among the most important fleshy fruits for fresh consumption. it belongs to the family cucurbitaceae which includes other important crops, such as watermelon, cucumber and squash. melon is a diploid species  of african origin with a high level of phenotypic and molecular variation  <cit>  and a genome size estimated at  <dig> mb  <cit> . over the last  <dig> years, several research groups have published genetic maps for melon  <cit> . an integrated map, proposed to serve as a reference map, was constructed, based on two recombinant inbred line  populations . this map contains  <dig> loci; it spans  <dig> cm on  <dig> linkage groups. it also includes  <dig> morphological traits  <cit> . another map, based on two populations derived from a cross between 'piel de sapo' and pi <dig>  identified several quantitative trait loci  controlling fruit-quality traits  <cit> . the katzir group has recently established a reference map based on a cross between pi <dig> and 'dulce'  <cit>  and constructed a qtl map using rils developed from this population  <cit> . other resources that were created for melon are a limited est collection  <cit>  and bac libraries  <cit> . although a substantial amount of effort has been invested in creating genetic maps and molecular tools for melon, only a few genes have been cloned by map-based cloning  <cit> . the genetic maps that exist for melon are not dense enough  and are still the limiting factor for mas, cloning of genes of interest and wga .

we chose melon as representative of a large group of vegetables and other crops that are agriculturally important but are still lagging behind in their genomic resources. although sequencing has become extremely affordable using new technologies, we are still not at a stage at which we can sequence a variety of the same plant again and again. in this paper, we present the ability to use a custom-designed microarray with longer oligos , based on a partial est database of melon, to discover thousands of new markers for melon. these markers can be used for genetic mapping, breeding and association studies.

RESULTS
sfp discovery
we designed a custom oligo microarray  based on the melon ests presented in the cucurbit genomic database   <cit> . the microarray contains  <dig>  unique probes from  <dig>  unigenes covering approximately  <dig> mb of cdna sequence from different ecotypes and different conditions . for marker discovery, we used dna from the parents of our mapping population, developed by katzir's group from a cross between representatives of two subspecies of cucumis melo l.: pi <dig>  and 'dulce' . two biological replicates from pi <dig> and two from 'dulce' were used. each biological replicate contained gdnas pooled from  <dig> different plants. gdna samples were labeled and hybridized using standard agilent procedures for comparative genomic hybridization  .

predicted sfps were identified using a linear model for microarray   <cit> . the data were analyzed and ranked by two statistics: the adjusted p-value  and the b statistic, which calculates the log odds that a given sfp will be different between two populations . the number of sfps found using an adjusted p-value  of 5% was  <dig> in  <dig> unigenes. using the b statistic with b ≥  <dig> , which indicates 82% probability of having differential alleles , we found  <dig> sfps in  <dig> genes. due to the fact that the q-value and b statistic rank the sfps in the same order, and since the b statistic requires prior knowledge of the proportion of sfps while the moderated-t statistic does not, we used the critical value of moderated-t statistic, i.e., a q-value <  <dig> .

sfp validation
since the number of available sequences from 'dulce' and pi <dig> in the database is relatively low, we performed validation by direct sequencing of pcr fragments that were amplified from gdna of the two parents, pi <dig> and 'dulce'. sfps were chosen randomly for sequencing . oligos flanking the sfps were designed and pcr products were amplified from pi <dig> and 'dulce' gdna pools:  <dig> putative sfps were fully sequenced from both plant cultivars. identification and validation of a sfp is demonstrated in figure  <dig>  the sequences were compared against the information in the melon database using vector nti software . most of the sfps  contained one or two snps, and the rest contained either more than two snps  or indels  . next, we counted the number of true and false positives  found by sequencing . we found, the most reliable sfps to be those that appear once per gene. we calculated the positive predictive value  for each number of sfps per gene category, since the proportion of the genes according to sfp number was biased in our sequencing sample. our ppv was found to be 79%, similar to that found in rice  <cit> , higher than what has been found in some other sfp-discovery studies, but significantly lower than that which has been found in some studies of arabidopsis and yeast  <cit> . analysis based on melon est databases  <cit>  showed that the frequency of variation discovered by our sfp array was 10-fold higher than that found in the partial transcriptome. another indication that the nucleotide polymorphisms in the detected sfp are biologically true is their polymorphism patterns. transition nucleotide substitutions are known to be more frequent than transversions  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the genotyping as detected by sequencing. the transition-to-transversion ratios in the pi <dig> and 'dulce' populations were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. indeed, pi <dig>  which is expected to be genetically more variable than the domestic cultivar, had a total of  <dig> -fold more nucleotide substitutions than 'dulce' .

summary of bioinformatics analysis of  <dig> sfps sequenced from the two different dna pools of pi and 'dulce'. the sequence data were compared to the database data. tp-true positive. fp-false positive. ppv-positive predictive value.

*total ppv was recalculated by taking into account the actual representation of the different sfps per unigene group in the population. ppv = tp/ for each number of sfps per gene category. the calculations were performed to adjust the validated sfp results with the proportions discovered by bioinformatics analysis.

based on the distribution of sfps per gene , most of the genes  accumulating sfps possessed one or two sfps per gene. one might postulate that this is because most of the unigenes, from which the probes present on the array were designed, are short or partial, and therefore the real number of sfps per gene cannot be determined. however, the length of the unigenes is variable and cannot explain the sfp/unigene variation. for each sfp density category , the mean unigene length was approximately constant at  <dig> ±  <dig> bp . in other words, length medians do not increase linearly with sfp per gene category as it would be expected if number of sfps that were found were due to unigene length. therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the sfp/gene distribution was the actual distribution, and it was consistent with the sfp density that has been previously reported for arabidopsis  <cit> .

can sfps be used in different mapping populations?
the ability of sfps to function as markers in different genetic backgrounds is crucial for their use in mas, association studies and genetic mapping. as plants host large genetic diversity, we decided to test the use of a set of sfps across different melon cultivars. we tested this question using parents of another melon mapping population, 'piel de sapo' and pi <dig>  <cit> . we performed hybridizations of two biological replicates  from each genotype on two arrays. the sfps, i.e., statistically significant signal ratios, that were independently found in both comparisons--'piel de sapo' vs. pi <dig> and 'dulce' vs. pi <dig> were designated as shared sfps. in comparisons between the spanish mapping population's parents, pi <dig> and 'piel de sapo', and the corresponding genotypes pi <dig> and 'dulce', the number of sfps was  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . using this set of genetic markers between the two cultivars  and the wild accessions pi <dig> and pi <dig>  we defined the shared sfp set of mapping markers, i.e. the intersection between the  <dig> sfps that differentiate 'piel de sapo' from pi <dig> and the  <dig> sfps that differentiate 'dulce' from pi <dig>  this subset included  <dig> sfps in  <dig> unigenes. an example of five genes from this intersecting subset is illustrated in figure  <dig>  from the data presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we concluded that sfps can be used across different genetic backgrounds in melon.

discussion
in the present study, we tested the feasibility of identifying genetic polymorphism in melon crops by hybridizing gdna to custom-designed microarrays based on a partial transcriptome. sfp technology has been previously applied for a variety of genetic applications, such as linkage analysis and association studies, mostly in model organisms such as arabidopsis and yeast  <cit> , with limited use in some other agricultural organisms  <cit> . one of the main reasons for the limited use of this technology is that the technological platform  is not available for many biological systems. in this study, we used custom-designed arrays with 45- <dig> mer probes  covering a substantial area of the partial transcriptome to discover genetic variation in melon. as a result, we increased the number of markers available for melon by an order of magnitude using the cost-effective sfp technology.

the melon cultivars showed substantial within-population genetic variation , as can be expected in agricultural crops. this needs to be considered when defining the variation between different cultivars. based on our results, the use of pools of different parents is essential to overcoming this issue.

with some exception  <cit> , studies have reported discrepancies between calculated and observed false discovery rates  for sfps. sequence validation  showed that the fdrs in our array  were similar to those found in rice   <cit>  and unsequenced arabidopsis strains   <cit> , better than those found in tomato   <cit> , and not as good as those found in some of the arabidopsis studies  <cit> . one reason for this discrepancy is that genetic variation in loci near a target may influence its affinity to probes  <cit> . in our study, we eliminated all putative sfps that did not harbor changes inside the sfp, because we could not evaluate the connection between these differences and hybridization to the sfps. nevertheless, these differences could still be used as markers. in this work we tried to exclude the possibility of minor frequency alleles . for example, focusing on a specific locus, in one parent the allele may be t in its two biological replicates  whereas in the other parent gdna pools, the t allele might make up only 80% of the pool and g might make up the other 20%. this might affect the hybridization signal, but it would not be observable at the sequence level. by showing that the inter-population variation is greater than the intra-population variation, we exclude this possibility . luo et al.  <cit> , using labeled cdna and affymetrix array in barley, suggested that many of the sfps that do not show any differences in direct sequencing are a result of cis-regulatory expression regulators. this explanation is not relevant to our study as we are using genomic dna for labeling. as only partial transcriptome data exist for melon, the ability to discover sfps and to eliminate cross-hybridizations and gene duplications is limited. divergence of exon-intron boundaries and alternative splicing of cdna that are printed on the array and the labeled genomic dna could also contribute to the high fdr that is found by sequencing. another explanation for the discrepancy in fdr can be the power of the statistical test, which is might be too low given the number of replicates in the different experimental systems, we do not believe that this is the reason for the high fdr as we used the empirical bayesian model that can repair low power in limma  <cit> ). one can improve the discovery rate by ignoring all multiple sfps , which can be considered copy number variations . it is also possible that by using this type of long probe array, we lose a portion of the variation; however in doing so, we gain better coverage of the transcriptome, flexibility in format design and lower price. we anticipate that by improving the array design and adding the complementary strand for each probe, the fdr will be reduced as suggested by smemo et al  <cit> . as the new agilent and nimblgen platforms hold much larger probes sets, one can increase the number of probes for any given sequence without hampering coverage. another solution is increasing the statistical threshold in order to the decrease the fdr. there no doubt that this approach will reduced the discrepancy in fdr but will also will reduced dramaticly the number of sfps that are discovered  <cit> .

the question of conservation of the sfp markers across melon cultivars was tested using two different mapping populations . the data presented here show that a large portion of the sfps are conserved between the different populations. this experiment demonstrated another advantage of sfp technology, which utilizes large sets of probes with no assumption of the location of the changes in different mapping populations. the large set of probes allows identification of large sets of genetic markers in different mapping populations. although these sets of markers are not ordered, one can still use them for breeding experiments as a whole -genome screening tool and for creating "classical" genetic maps.

developing a custom-designed array creates the possibility of using sfp technology in many agricultural systems that do not have an affymetrix platform and allows much more flexibility in design and use. the low price of the screening and the relatively rapid execution and flexibility make it a useful technology. although sfp technology is far from perfect, and a reduction in fdrs is needed to make thi approach more efficient, we firmly believe that it can contribute to marker discovery, mas and wgs approaches in various crop plants. we therefore envision the ability to use wgs  as a routine element in the process of mas in breeding programs as the next challenge in the field of breeding technology.

CONCLUSIONS
sfps can be discovered using custom-designed microarrays and partial genomic data. this approach can be used with many agricultural organisms for marker discovery and breeding.
