BACKGROUND
tetrandrine , a bisbenzylisoquinoline , isolated from the root of the plant stephania tetrandra has a number of potential medicinal properties. these include blockage of voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit> , large-conductance ca2+ activated k+  channels, and intracellular ca2+ pumps  <cit> . tet also has anti-inflammatory  <cit>  and anti-cancer activities  <cit> . tet stimulates prostaglandin e <dig> production by macrophages  <cit> , probably after first releasing the substrate, arachidonic acid  by altering phospholipase  activities. tet also induces apoptosis in many cell types including human leukemic , human lung carcinoma , human hepatoblastoma , neuro 2a mouse neuroblastoma and rat glioma cells   <cit> .

thapsigargin , a hexaoxygenated tetracycle sesquiterpine lactone,  isolated from the plant thapsia garganica, also has a number of potential medicinal applications  <cit> . however, thap is classified as a weak tumor promoter as measured in the two-stage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis  <cit> . nevertheless, thap  <cit>  and its enzymatically modified analog  <cit>  have been proposed as targeted therapy for prostate cancer. thap, like tet, blocks intracellular calcium pumps resulting in increased cytoplasmic ca2+,  . it also affects ion channels. thap induces a ca2+-dependent release of aa from -aa labelled macrophages and stimulates aa metabolism in the rat peritoneal macrophages  <cit> . thap induces apoptosis in many cells including human neuroblastoma, colon cancer and prostate cancer cells and thymocytes  <cit> .

based on the stimulation of aa release by known cancer chemopreventative agents, i have proposed that aa release by cells is associated with cancer chemoprevention  <cit> , possibly, but not necessarily, by activating a secreted tumor suppressor phospholipase a <dig>   <cit> . in this report, evidence is presented that tet, a potential cancer chemopreventive compound, and thap, a weak tumor promoter that also possesses potential cancer preventative properties for androgen-independent prostate cancer, both stimulate aa release from human colon carcinoma and rat liver cells. both compounds also stimulate prostacyclin  production in rat liver cells. the release of aa and aa metabolites appears to be initiated by different mechanisms.

RESULTS
tet and thap release aa from human colon carcinoma  cells and rat liver  cells in a concentration-dependent fashion . as little as  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm thap stimulates aa release. with both ht- <dig> and c- <dig> cells, thap is about  <dig> to  <dig> times more potent than tet. characterizations of these effects are shown in table  <dig>  pre-incubation with actinomycin d partially inhibits stimulation by thap but does not affect stimulation by tet. tet's stimulation of aa release does not require new mrna synthesis, whereas thap's stimulation does. as shown below, thap's stimulation is mediated, in part, by the ca2+-dependent pla <dig> an induced enzyme. the absence of extracellular ca2+ partially inhibits thap's stimulations but does not affect the aa release stimulated by tet. depolarization of the cells with  <dig> mm kcl does not affect tet's stimulations, but does partially inhibit release of aa stimulated by thap. pre-incubation with the l-type ca2+ channel blocker, diltiazem, has no effect on the actions of either tet or thap in ht- <dig> or c- <dig> cells.

** = bapta/am  stimulates aa release ), mem/bsa control vs ), bapta/am . thus, the effect of bapta/am on c- <dig> cells is not recorded.

the role of i in these stimulations is striking. while pre-incubation with the i chelator, bapta/am , does not affect tet's stimulation of aa release from ht- <dig> cells, such treatment does inhibit thap's stimulation of aa release from the ht- <dig> cells . thus, a role for intracellular ca2+ pumps is strongly suggested only for the action of thap. ohuchi et al  <cit>  had shown that i increased within  <dig> min after treatment with thap as measured by fluorescence changes in quin  <dig> loaded peritoneal cells. a similar rise in i has been measured after administration of thap to thymocytes, rat liver microsomes  <cit>  and in macrophages, astrocytoma cells, fibroblasts and human tumor lymphocytes  <cit> . the findings that the increased aa release is stimulated  <dig> minutes after incubation of ht- <dig> and c- <dig> cells with thap is consistent with a role for increased i in the activities of thap .

while both cells express cox activity  <cit> , only the major product of cox activity  can be quantitatively estimated at the low cell densities used in these studies. both tet and thap stimulate pgi <dig>  production in these c- <dig> cells . as with aa release, thap is at least 10-times more potent at stimulating pgi <dig> production than tet.

the likely role of i in the stimulation of pgi <dig> production by thap is shown in fig.  <dig>  chelation of the increased i with bapta/am completely inhibits the stimulation by thap but has no effect on the stimulation with tet.

discussion
it has been proposed that the cancer chemopreventative properties attributed to tet reside in its ability to effect ion channels which leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . retinoic acids, tamoxifen, ppar-agonists, , some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin d <dig>  anti-oxidants,  and statins all release aa from cells in culture  <cit> . all have been shown to have cancer preventative properties. results of studies on correlation, if any, of aa release and cancer chemoprevention by tet or thap have not been published. for the purpose of this study, however, i have postulated that the cancer chemopreventive properties of the test agent are causally related to the capacity of that ligand to release aa. i have also suggested that most, if not all, of these agents at μm concentrations, may be intercalating into the cell membrane and releasing aa as a result of activated plase activity  <cit> .

the mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that leads to apoptosis and cancer chemoprevention also involves stimulation of aa release and is associated with sphingomyelin to ceramide conversion  <cit> . the aa release probably results in ceramide-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . both tet and thap stimulate the release of aa from human colon carcinoma and rat liver cells. tet does prevent cancer  but thap is considered to be a weak tumor promotor as measured in the two-stage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis  <cit> . thap and some of its analogs, however, do induce apoptosis in androgen-independent prostatic cancer cells  <cit> . apoptotic effects of thap also have been reported in thymocytes and mouse lymphomas, including the wrh17- <dig> and whb <dig> cell lines  <cit> .

clear differences in the pathways of aa release stimulated by tet and thap were found in this study. tet stimulates aa release  in ht- <dig> and c- <dig> cells and pgi <dig> production in c- <dig> cells . it has been reported that tet blocks voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit>  and depolarizes the cells  <cit> , but blockage of these channels does not affect aa release . nor is the aa release stimulated by tet blocked by pre-incubation of the cells with actinomycin d, in the presence of  <dig> mm kcl or in the absence of extracellular ca2+. it is interesting to note that cycloheximide , did not affect tet's induced apoptosis in human lymphoblasts   <cit> . tet's stimulation of aa release is not affected by the  chelator, bapta/am . in contrast, thap's release of aa by ht- <dig> cells is blocked by bapta/am , is inhibited by pre-incubation with actinomycin d, is inhibited by egta and is inhibited when the cells are incubated in  <dig> m m kcl . that the rise in i resulting from treatment with thap appears to be associated with the stimulation of aa release is suggested by the relatively early increase, after  <dig> minutes, of aa release . both tet and thap stimulate pgi <dig> production in the c- <dig> cells , but only the pgi <dig> production stimulated by thap is inhibited by bapta/am .

the relationship between aa release and cancer chemoprevention by tet and thap could be explained, in part, by implicating the pla <dig> enzymes that catalyze the release of aa from phospholipids. the tumor suppressing spla <dig> may be only one of sixteen structurally different pla <dig> enzymes  <cit> . if the tumor suppressor genes are overexpressed or activated, at least two cancer preventative pathways may result, one from the activity of the group 11a tumor suppressor  and a second from the aa released. the proximity of the pla <dig> to the aa-esterified phospholipid after treatment of the cells is of importance, and may depend on the location of binding of the test agent. for example, celecoxib binds at the upper hydrocarbon core, close to the phospholipid head groups whereas rofeco

xib binds at the polar head groups of the membrane  <cit> . celecoxib and rofecoxib differ in their release of aa  <cit> . tet may activate a tumor suppressing spla <dig>  while thap induces the ca2+-dependent cpla <dig>  both would lead to aa release.

CONCLUSIONS
cells treated with tetrandrine and thapsigargin share several common features including pathways that lead to induction of apoptosis. these properties probably reflect their interaction with cell membranes and the altered expression of signaling processes. one reaction that does not appear to be shared is deesterification of a phospholipid by a pla <dig>  based on the effects of inhibition of mrna synthesis,  <dig> mm kcl, extracellular and especially intracellular ca 2+, thapsigargin's release is mediated, in part, by a ca 2+-dependent pla <dig>  whereas tetrandrine's stimulated release is mediated by a secretory pla <dig>  in addition to the altered signaling properties that accompany the membrane intercalation, both tetrandrine and thapsigargin release biologically active aa.
