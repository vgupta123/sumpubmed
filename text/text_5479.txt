BACKGROUND
high temperatures and pressures cause damage to living cells. for humans and the best studied organisms, conditions with temperature close to 27°c  and atmospheric pressure around  <dig>  mpa are optimal. however, there exist organisms, which colonize habitats extreme, life-incompatible for humans. such conditions are near deep hot springs colonized by communities of organisms, the extremophiles  <cit> . their life is sustained under conditions with temperature as high as 100°c  and pressure above 20 mpa, exceeding the atmospheric by  <dig> times. the mechanisms by which cell survival is provided are not well understood. their elucidation would provide answers to some fundamental questions on the origins of life and the early adaptation of microorganisms  <cit> , also on adaptation to the conditions of diverse ecological niches  <cit> . a timely challenge is the identification of the molecular mechanisms of the evolutionary adaptation of the genomes and proteomes of the living beings to the conditions of high temperature  <cit> - <cit>  and pressure  <cit> - <cit> . extremophiles were supposed to provide unprecedented opportunities for biotechnological explorations   <cit> - <cit> . indeed, based on research on extremophiles, enzymes were developed for biotechnological applications.

to study the possible mechanisms of the influence of high temperature and pressure on the protein dynamics and protein adaptation to altered environmental pressure, we used here computer md simulations of two homologous nip <dig> proteins from hyperthermophilic  archaea, shallow water p. furiosus   <cit>  and deep-water, p. abyssi   <cit> , <cit> . the goal of our work was to compare the dynamics properties of the models we built at high and low temperatures, also at atmospheric and high pressures to identify their common characteristics, also their differences presumably related to the different depths of the organisms’ habitats.

nip <dig> was initially identified in yeast as required for processing of the 27s pre-rrna to form the mature 25s and  <dig> s rrnas  <cit> . it localizes to the nucleolus but was also found to sediment in the region of free 60s subunits in sucrose density gradients  <cit> , which is consistent with its presence in pre-60s complexes  <cit> . experimental evidence suggests that the p. abyssi nip <dig> may be an exosome regulatory factor. it binds preferentially to u- and au-rich rnas and strongly inhibits the exosome due to its association with both the exosome complex and the substrate rna  <cit> .

the 3d structure of p. abyssi nip <dig> protein is known . the protein polypeptide chain is  <dig> amino acids long of which  <dig> residues are represented in the 3d structure. the protein consists of two α-β domains  <cit> , figure  <dig>  the n-terminal domain  is composed of five antiparallel β-strands surrounded by three α-helices and one  <dig> helix. there is an assumption that archaeal nip <dig> may interact with exosome via its n-terminal domain, thereby controlling the exosome function  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of this interaction is unknown.

the c-terminal domain is assigned to the pua class.  <cit> . it includes amino acid residues 91– <dig> and is comprised of a mixture of β-sheets, one α-helix, and one short  <dig> helix  <cit> . this domain, named after pseudouridine synthases and archaeosine-specific transglycosylases  <cit> , was initially described in trna modifying enzymes and in pseudo-uridine synthases from archaea and eukaryotes  <cit> , and it has been proposed to mediate protein-rna interactions. comparative structural analyses revealed that the residues involved in rna contacts are conservative in the archaeal pua domains  <cit> . in the p. abyssi nip <dig>  these are residues k <dig>  l <dig>  d <dig>  p <dig>  e <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  k <dig>  l <dig>  k <dig> , whose interactions with rna have been confirmed by the results of mutation experiments  <cit> . the pua domain contacts the rna molecule using a glycine-containing loop, which connects the fifth α-helix and the β <dig> strand via residues of the β <dig> strand . the structural alignment suggests that nip <dig> may use a mechanism similar to arctgt for rna interaction, which binds to the bottom of the trnaval acceptor stem through the major groove. in the yeast and human nip <dig>  however, some rna-binding residues are replaced by a glycine and three residues with hydrophobic side chain  <cit> .

the nip <dig> from p. abyssi and its p. furiosus homolog share 70% identity in their sequences . comparative analysis identified the excess of radical versus conservative amino acid substitutions fixation rates in nip <dig> p. furiosus after divergence from the deep-sea ancestor it shared with p. abyssi and p. horikoshii <cit> . it was suggested that nip <dig> and some other proteins, which were concerned predominantly with “translation machinery” and “ribosomal function” evolved under positive darwinian selection, resulted from their adaptation to altered conditions of elusive pressures. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this mode of gene evolution remained unclear.

a deletion/insertion free alignment is an advantage for simulations of the p. furiosus 3d structure allowing to omit the reconstruction of loops. the nip <dig> proteins are simulated at atmospheric pressures, also at  <dig> and 100 mpa. given the fact that the temperatures optimal for these two organisms are close to 373 k, we consider simulations at room  and elevated  temperatures.

the results show that the models of the two proteins at all the examined pressures and temperatures are compact, stable and similar to the crystal nip <dig> structure. analysis of protein structure dynamics at different pressures and temperatures allowed us to disclose similarities and differences between the deep- and shallow-sea protein models at different temperatures and pressures.

RESULTS
 <dig>  stability of models
figure  <dig> shows changes in the root mean – square deviations  of the protein cα atoms relative to the starting structures during the md simulations for the trajectories at 50 mpa. from figure  <dig> it follows that the structures achieve equilibrium starting from about 10 ns of the trajectory periods. the deviations from the starting structure are about 2 Å for the nip7-aby model, they are about  <dig>  Å for the nip7-fur model.

the average values and the 95% confidence intervals at different pressure and temperature values are given in Å.

as shown in table  <dig>  the protein deviates from the crystal structure at higher temperatures; however, the mean rmsd is not greater than  <dig>  Å for nip7-fur and  <dig>  Å for nip7-aby, thereby supporting the inference that the structures are stable throughout the md simulations at all the parameters under study. table  <dig> also shows that the rmsd for both proteins tends to increase with rising temperature.

the radius of gyration  is another indicator of stability of a structure during simulation. the average rgs of the protein structures for trajectories at different pressures and temperatures are compared in figure  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  most differences between the rg values for different trajectories do not exceed the standard errors of means, thereby providing evidence that our models are stable. it should be noted that this is associated with somewhat greater rg for nip7-fur than nip7-aby. two-way anova of the rg values for nip7-fur and nip7-aby demonstrated that alterations in pressure and temperature did not result in significant changes in the mean rg values for both protein models .

 <dig>  analysis of solvent accessibility
we compute for each trajectory the average values of solvent accessibility of the residues for the entire protein , also separately for the polar  and hydrophobic  surface fractions. we calculate the mean and standard error of these parameters over five runs for each protein model and pressure-temperature values set. the results are given in figure  <dig> 

as seen in figure  <dig>  the total area is somewhat smaller for nip7-fur. higher values for the solvent accessible polar portion of the residues are observed for the nip7-aby than for the nip7-fur model . the area of the hydrophobic part of the model is smaller . these observations concerned all the pressure and temperature parameters we studied.

the following trends in the values of the sas parameters of the nip7-fur model are notable:  the rise in temperature at the same pressures increases the solvent accessibility of the polar portion of the protein  and decreases the area of the hydrophobic portion of the surface, this is associated with a small change in the total area ;  the increase in pressure systematically reduces the sas values . however, most changes are in the range of the mean standard errors.

as for the nip7-aby model, the behavior of its sas parameters was ambiguous. sasp at atmospheric pressure and 373 k is greater, than at 300 k, whereas at 100 mpa, on the contrary, is lower . a significant increase in sash at elevating temperature  was other characteristic of this model. at the constant high temperature, increase in pressure resulted in decrease in the sas values of all the three types . in contrast, at constant t = 300 k, the sasp values increased with increasing pressure, although within the limits of standard deviations . changes of sash for the nip7-aby model demonstrates no systematic trend at increasing pressure ; as for sash, it slightly changes at p = 50 mpa, as compared with p =  <dig>  mpa, it rises slightly with pressure increasing to 100 mpa, becoming actually equal to sash at p =  <dig>  mpa.

we estimated the influence of temperature and pressure on change in the surface area of the models on the basis of two-way anova . taken together, the data agree with the analysis shown in figure  <dig>  temperature exerts a significant influence on the hydrophobic part of the nip7-aby surface area, thereby demonstrating that the influence of pressure and temperature on change in the total area of protein surface is not additive. this presumably reflects the difference in the sas values between the high and low temperature nip7-aby trajectories. as for the nip7-fur model, pressure exerts a significant influence on both the hydrophobic part of the area and sast.

thus, pressure and temperature differently affect residue solvent accessibility for the two protein models. pressure results in a decrease in the solvent accessible surface area. this effect is the most conspicuous at high temperatures.

 <dig>  local structure of the polypeptide chain
the next step was to define how the conformation of the different regions of the polypeptide chain deviates from the x-ray nip <dig> structural model. for different trajectories, we built graphs showing the dependencies of the local structure deviation  parameter . these graphs concerned every residue; we estimated also the mean rmsdl error, which characterizes its fluctuation during the simulations. . the graphs give prominence to the non-uniform local changes in the protein structure during the simulations. there are regions where deviations are quite small , while in the other regions changes in the local chain conformation relative to the crystal structure are considerable . in such cases, the rmsdls of the polypeptide chain conformation are greater in those regions, which correspond to the loops connecting the secondary structure elements. regions with great rmsdl values are, as a rule, located where amino acids substitutions are numerous . as a result, the evolutionary and structurally variable regions are virtually the same . for this segment, the rmsdl values are low, whereas the number of differences between the p. abyssi and p. furiosus nip <dig> sequences is high.

other features concern the differences in the rmsdls values between the n- and c-terminal domains  <cit> . there are regions with small rmsdl values and peaks in the loop regions  for the n-terminal domain. the graphs of structural variations in the c-terminal, the pua-domain, also contain maxima at positions 105– <dig>  115– <dig>  143– <dig>  and minima; however, the minima values are substantially higher than those for the n-terminal domain. from comparisons of the deviation graphs for the different trajectories, it is evident that the regions corresponding to the rmsdl maxima are by and large the same for the trajectories that correspond to both high pressures and temperatures . this means that the local changes in the conformation of the protein chain in our models occur in the same region of the structure despite the different nature of the destabilizing factor .

the effects of pressure and temperature on changes in the conformation of the polypeptide chain in the nip <dig> models are now considered. the most conspicuous fact is that, at the same pressure, elevated temperature causes an increase in the rmsdls for some protein residues . the changes in the rmsdls of the polypeptide chain resulting from elevated temperature occur non-uniformly. for example, greater rmsdls at elevated temperature are observed in the nip7-aby model in the region of the α2-α <dig> loop . conversely, for some regions in this model, an increase in temperature results in their decrease, for example residues 109– <dig> of the c-terminal domain. a similar pattern is observed for this model at low , moderate  and high  pressures. however, for some regions of the protein changes in the rmsdls at elevated temperature are only slight.

the interesting features brought out by comparing the two proteins are the higher rmsdl values for the c-terminal domain in nip7-fur compared to nip7-aby at any pressure-temperature parameter .

to make the local structure changes more prominent with respect to the temperature and pressure, we performed an analysis of the sensitivity of the residue rmsdl parameter to temperature  and pressure  expressed as the ratio of the rmsdl at high and low temperature and high and low pressure . we also estimated the dependence of the rmsdl parameter for each residue on the temperature and pressure using two-way anova . the influence of temperature and pressure on the rmsdl parameter was significant, if the corresponding f-statistics was above the threshold at α =  <dig>  .

figure 5a illustrates that temperature sensitivity of the rmsdl parameter is different, being dependent on protein position in the two models. to begin with, there are protein regions for which temperature significantly increases the rmsdl  for both models. to such regions belongs, in the first place, the long segment extending from the c-terminal part of the β <dig> strand to the n-terminal end of the β <dig> strand . the f-statistics for most of its residues exceeds by many times the 5% critical value for both models . in the graphs given in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  this region corresponds to the peak rmsdl values, which increase when temperature elevates. a small, yet significant, increase in the rmsdl is established in the n-terminal domain for both models at positions 26– <dig> . a significant increase in the rmsdl residues at positions 31– <dig>  under the influence of high temperature is also characteristic of the nip7-fur model. high values of the sit parameter are observed for the n-terminal regions of both models, however, the influence of temperature on change in the rmsdl for these residues proved to be insignificant.

an interesting pattern was observed for the c-terminal domain. sit < <dig> for the great majority of residues, the differences were significant for many of them. this meant that elevation in temperature made the conformation of the c-terminal domain to a great extent similar to that of the crystal structures. these changes were the most prominent for region 109– <dig> . this was associated with lower sit values characteristic of the nip7-aby model. another region, which was also subject to conformational change at elevated temperature in the models, joined two protein domains . a significant decrease in the rmsdl was characteristic of the c-terminal residues in both models, too.

the sensitivity of the rmsdl values to elevated pressure is shown in figure 5b. we compared sip and sit with respect to the positions at which their proportions are significantly different for both models. we found that their number is considerably smaller for sip than sit. for the nip7-fur model, significant changes are observed in the n-terminal domain . for the nip7-aby model, fluctuations in the sip values are more expressed, however, changes at positions 41– <dig>  and 85– <dig>  are significant.

 <dig>  analysis of the secondary structure
to describe in more detail the conformational changes, we analyzed the secondary structure of the nip <dig> protein models at different md trajectories. additional file 3: figure s <dig> provides evidence for the stability of the secondary structure during the simulations. for example, although the rmsdl values for the loop 69– <dig>  are high , the secondary structure pattern of the polypeptide chain demonstrates no changes dependent on pressure and temperature. this may suggest that this β-hairpin changes its conformation without breaking hydrogen bonds, just by bending or twisting.

analysis of the data on the changes in the protein secondary structure  shows also that a part of its elements is unstable when pressure and temperature change. for example, this is characteristic of the loop formed by residues 48– <dig> . at different pressures and temperatures, the conformation of these residues varies from the states of the α-helix , the  <dig> –helix , the turn , and to the bend . a local maximum of the deviations of the polypeptide chain from the crystal structure, the rmsdl  are observed in the segment. thus, this protein segment proves to be very mobile.

other regions of smaller size with unstable secondary structures are the first n-terminal residues, the β <dig> terminal residues  and the β11–β <dig> loop . these regions show characteristic transitions from the loop to the bend, also the maximum rmsdl values .

the above described conformational changes are supported by the trajectory snapshots providing new dimensions of the credibility of our models . thus, residues 69– <dig>  which belong to the β-turn, have a stable secondary structure, but high rmsdl values. these residues bend towards the globular part of the n-terminal domain during the simulations. in so doing, they twist slightly the β-sheet. the sweep of the loop 69– <dig> bend depends on pressure and temperature. similar conformational changes  are also observed for the loop between the β3-β <dig> strands. it also shows characteristic rmsdl deviations . as seen in figure 6b, the range of the fluctuations widens at high temperatures in the nip7-aby model, a similar widening is true for the nip7-fur model . the structural fluctuations in the segment 45– <dig> and those in the loops between the β-strands of the terminal domain are conspicuous, too.

 <dig>  fluctuations in the polypeptide chain
we estimated the structural flexibility of the two proteins at different temperatures and pressures. the graphs display the dependencies of the root-mean-squared-fluctuation  on the residue number .

the peak regions of the rmsf values enclose predominantly loops in the sequence regions at positions 31– <dig> , 50– <dig> , 69– <dig> , 98– <dig> , 120– <dig> , 132– <dig> , 140– <dig> . these regions correspond to those where the rmsfs are the largest. in addition, the highest values for the local root-mean-square deviations of the polypeptide chain  are observed in them .

the other features are the high rmsf values for the residues at the amino  and carboxy -termini of the proteins. notably, the rmsf values are somewhat higher for the trajectories at high temperature than for those at 300 k. these differences were observed for both nip7-aby and nip7-fur .

the sensitivity of the rmsf value to increase in temperature and pressure was analyzed for each and every amino acid residue in the same manner as was for the rmsdl parameter. the results are shown in figure  <dig> . analysis of the sensitivity profiles of the residues to temperature demonstrated that increase in temperature raised the value of the local polypeptide fluctuations for all the residues at high significance . however, the graph displays regions weakly sensitive to increase in temperature, even insensitive to it . the rmsf values are high in the residues of the loop already at 300 k, while increase in temperature does not cause any considerable increase in their mobility.

the results are different for fluctuations in the nip <dig> models of the deep- and shallow-sea organisms at increased pressure . the sip parameter is above unity for a small fraction of residues. for the n-terminal domain, the decrease in fluctuations under the effect of pressure is greater for the nip7-aby than the nip7-fur model. in this domain, pressure significantly influences residues located at positions 6– <dig> , positions  <dig>   <dig> , and 54– <dig> .

for the nip7-fur rmsf, a significant influence of pressure is observed in residues mostly in the c-terminal part of the protein. a wide region of these residues spans positions 97– <dig> , the most sensitive region to increase in pressure and sip < <dig> . several other residues for which rmsf decreased by pressure significantly are located the β <dig> region , β <dig> , β <dig>  and at position  <dig>  several positions demonstrating significant decrease in the rmsf under pressure are located in the n-terminal domain . there are, however, residues for which the rmsf changes significantly when pressure increases. they are observed for nip7-fur only . interestingly, the single position, which demonstrates the significant dependence of its rmsf value on the pressure for both models,  <dig>  is located in the α2–α <dig> loop. however, the influence is inversed for this residue in the nip7-fur and nip7-aby models.

to analyze the influence of pressure and temperature on fluctuations in the models, we performed two-way anova at different temperatures for both the entire models and separately for each domain. the mean rmsf values for the cα atoms in the nip7-aby and nip7-fur models at different trajectories were compared . statistical analysis demonstrates that, for the nip7-aby model at 300 k, change in pressure does not affect significantly fluctuations in the n- and c- domains. however, differences in fluctuations between these domains are significant. in general, the c-terminal domain demonstrates larger fluctuations compared with the n-terminal domain. at high temperature, the influence of pressure on the rmsf of two domains becomes significant. the fluctuations in both domains decreased at high pressure. the difference in the fluctuations between two domains at high temperature remains the same as at 300 k. in other words, the fluctuations are greater for the c-terminal domain.

for the nip7-fur model, pressure exerts a significant influence on the rmsf values in the two domains both at low and high temperatures . the fluctuations in both domains decrease with increase in pressure, like in the nip7-aby model. the differences in the rmsf values for the two domains are significant at  <dig> and 373 k.

 <dig>  analysis of salt bridges
the crystal structure of p. abyssi contains eight pairs of residues forming salt bridges  <cit> . it should be noted that the positions of the side chain atoms have not been resolved for some residues capable of forming salt bridges probably due to their decreased stability under crystallization conditions. these are glu <dig>  lys <dig>  for example. in our simulations it is feasible to reconstruct side chain atoms for these residues and to take them into account in salt-bridge stability analysis. for each and every possible salt bridge, the proportion of structures was estimated where such a bridge was formed . this was done for all the trajectories and models under study. analysis of the nip7-aby and nip7-fur models revealed that there were stable salt bridges , moderately stable  and a number of unstable salt bridges occurring in less than 20% of the structures . the number of stable and moderately stable salt bridges was larger in nip7-aby, twenty, than in nip7-fur, thirteen. interestingly, the residues with unresolved side chain atoms in the crystal structure formed moderately stable salt bridges only in the nip7-fur and nip7-aby models.

six salt bridges  are the most stable in the nip7-aby model . these form in more than 70% of the structures in both the nip7-aby and nip7-fur models. the glu33-arg <dig> and glu131-arg <dig> pairs  may be referred to the most conservative in nip7-fur . four stable salt bridges from the n-terminal domain  form a network that links the alpha-helix and the beta-strands. the remaining salt bridges may be assigned to the moderately stable. some stable or moderately stable salt bridges in nip7-aby are unstable in the nip7-fur . there are also two salt bridges moderately stable in the nip7-fur and unstable in the nip7-aby models  .

analysis of the functional role of the most stable salt bridges demonstrated  that most of them stabilized the packaging of the elements of the protein secondary structure. however, a number of salt bridges in our models formed residues for which interactions with rna has been demonstrated  <cit> . there are four such pairs among stable bridges for the nip7-aby model and only one for nip7-fur model  is formed by a residue pair with both involved in the interaction with rna, the other salt bridges are either unstable or missing in the nip7-fur model.

how high temperatures and pressures may affect the formation of salt bridges in the two different protein models? to answer this question, we introduced for each salt bridge its index of sensitivity to pressure  and temperature  in the same manner as we did for the rmsdl and the rmsf parameters . the higher were the values of these indices, the greater was the persistence of a bridge at high pressure or temperature. to estimate the significance of the influence of pressure and temperature on the stability of a salt bridge, we applied two-way anova and obtained values of the statistics f, f . we assumed that high temperature or pressure exerted an influence on stability of a salt bridge, if the corresponding f and f statistics exceeded the  <dig>  significance threshold. the results for the stable and moderately stable salt bridges common to both models are given in table  <dig>  additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  they demonstrate that for the nip7-aby model, of the  <dig> stable salt bridges  <dig>  are affected by high temperatures . one salt bridge is significantly subject to the influence of pressure  both also become stable at high temperature. this bridge becomes also stable at high temperatures in nip7-fur. both models also contain salt bridges, whose temperature sensitivity considerably, yet insignificantly, deviates from  <dig> . most become stable when temperature rises . thus, elevation in temperature for a number of salt bridges in our models changes their persistence mainly in favor of its increase.

a more detailed consideration of the salt bridge stability may reveal certain interesting details. bridge 131– <dig>  whose stability, in the case of the deep-water protein, is under the significant influence of temperature, and is formed by the side chain groups of residues asp <dig> and arg <dig> for the nip7-aby model. in the case of the shallow-water protein, aspartic acid is substituted by glutamic acid at position  <dig> and no significant influence of temperature is observed. bridge 148– <dig> is formed by the side chain groups of residues arg148-asp <dig> for the nip7-aby model. in the case of the shallow-water protein, arginine is substituted by lysine at position  <dig> and, as a result, this bridge turns out to be unstable for the nip7-fur model. therefore, the structure of the side chain radicals has a strong impact on the stability of these salt bridges.

 <dig>  influence of protein type on the dynamics of protein structure
to estimate the influence amino acid substitutions exerted on the structural properties of the nip <dig> proteins in comparison with factors such as temperature and pressure, we performed three-way anova for each residue. the results are given in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of the influence temperature exerts on the rmsdl in the two models shows that the local structure deviates significantly from the crystal 2p38:a for  <dig> of the  <dig> positions we analyzed . pressure exerts a significant influence on the rmsdl at only  <dig> positions of the protein , while protein type exerts a significant influence on the conformational deviations of the polypeptide chain for  <dig> positions, 63% .

the most characteristic differences are observed for the c-terminal domain of the protein . furthermore, significant differences in the rmsdl parameter depending on model type are observed for regions 16– <dig>  40– <dig>  67– <dig> and position  <dig>  as seen, the deviations from the crystal structure are greater for the nip7-fur than the nip7-aby model.

a similar analysis was carried out for the rmsf parameters of the amino acid residues . the results showed that a rise in temperature caused a significant increase in the rmsf for all, without exception, amino acid residues of the nip <dig> protein. pressure exerted a significant influence on change in  <dig> amino acid residues . type of model exerted an influence on change in fluctuations for  <dig>  of the amino acid residues.

significant differences between the rmsf values for the residues of the two models were observed both in the case when fluctuations were higher for the nip7-aby model and, conversely, for the nip7-fur model . residues at positions of the n-terminal domain  corresponding to the α <dig> helix and the β <dig> strand, also position  <dig> , also the c-terminal domain  are referred to the first group. positions 65– <dig>  78– <dig>   <dig>  120– <dig>  131– <dig>  138– <dig> are referred to the second group.

discussion
 <dig>  effect of temperature and pressure on the structure and dynamics of nip7
in our work we compare the dynamics of two nip <dig> protein models, nip7-aby from p. abyssi, a deep water organism, and nip7-fur, from p. furiosus, a shallow water organism, at different temperatures and pressures.

the hallmark feature of our models is their stability throughout the simulation period . it is well maintained at both elevated temperatures and pressures. the rmsds from the crystal structure  are, on average, smaller for the nip7-aby than the nip7-fur model. it could be remembered, however, that the nip7-fur model is not crystallographic, but it has been rather produced by homology modeling, which could indeed justify a larger rmsd. the secondary structure of the model changes slightly, thereby providing evidence that the structural differences between the two proteins are related to change in loop conformation and in mutual disposition of the secondary structure elements.

exposure to high temperature for the two proteins results in change in the equilibrated conformations of the polypeptide chain, on the one hand , and in increase in its fluctuations, on the other hand.

conformational changes at increasing temperature are related to decrease in structural deviations from the crystal structure in the c-terminal domain, including the positions that form the interaction with rna. the deviations increase in the regions of the helices α2-α <dig> in the n-terminal domain. it should be noted that the specific influence of elevated temperature on the conformation of the protein, on its active centers in particular, is one of the possible mechanisms providing optimal protein activity in this region. for example, the important role of temperature-dependent conformational transitions of protein, at its active site particularly, in the enzymatic activity of the nadh oxidase from thermus thermophilus has been well demonstrated at high temperatures  <cit> . also it was demonstrated that some mutation may increase and some of them may decrease the thermostability of thioredoxins from escherichia coli and bacillus acidocaldarius; the thermostability of these proteins was revealed to depend on ionic interactions between the thermolabile regions  <cit> . such conformational changes may be important to the nip <dig> functions as well.

the comparison of the protein models obtained at  <dig> and 300 k demonstrates that at high temperature the fluctuations in the polypeptide chain increase, although the compactness of the protein structure is preserved . the increase in the fluctuations of the polypeptide chain is non-uniform. the regions subject to the fluctuations are mainly loops and the terminal regions of the protein. like in the case of the rmsdl, the region α2-α <dig> proved to be the most subject to increase in the rmsf among the internal regions of the chain. it is pertinent to note that a similar effect of high temperatures on the conformation of the polypeptide chain is characteristic of the high temperature protein models  <cit> - <cit> .

the effect of increased pressure on protein structure is manifold. the structural deviations of the nip7-aby from the conformation of the nip <dig> model based on the x-ray diffraction structural data at high temperatures decrease as pressure increases. this trend holds true for the nip7-fur model . the increased pressure results in a decrease in the accessible surface area. this decrease is characteristic of nip7-fur for which the influence pressure exerts on the sas value is significant . a significant decrease in the sas area is observed for the nip7-aby model, only at high temperature. in this way, increase in pressure makes the nip <dig> structure more compact, an effect more expressed at high temperature.

the increase in pressure produces structural rearrangements of the protein. thus, for the nip7-aby model, this increase results in a decrease in the local deviations of protein conformation from the crystal structure. this is in complete agreement with the conclusions that the pressure affects essentially slower motions which imply structural rearrangements of the protein globule  <cit> . the pressurization effect is more pronounced for the nip7-aby model and it affects the conformation non-uniformly, increasing the rmsdl in some regions and decreasing it in others . as for the nip7-fur model most conformational changes occur under high pressure in the n-terminal domain.

a decrease in the fluctuations in the polypeptide is another effect of an increase in pressure we observed both at the domain  and the residue levels .

the md simulations of protein structures subject to increased pressure have yielded abundant evidence of reduced fluctuations in the polypeptide chain due to pressurization  <cit> - <cit> . they are convergent in demonstrating that, if the protein globule does not denaturate, pressure can stabilize the polypeptide chain. an increase in protein stability resulting from an increase in pressure has been demonstrated experimentally for the exemplary glutamate dehydrogenases from the hyperthermophilic archaea pyrococcus furiosus <cit>  and thermococcus litoralis <cit> . the published data support ours: indeed, an increase in pressure stabilized significantly the protein globule, also the protein complex formed by the enzymes. the authors suggested that such a stabilization may arise through changes in the stability of the native states due to reduced fluctuations in the polypeptide chain at high pressures and temperatures  <cit> . however, our results demonstrate that the magnitude of the effect can be different for protein parts and for proteins from different organisms.

 <dig>  functional implications for nip7
our current results demonstrate that the c-terminal domain is subject to larger structural displacements and fluctuations than the n-terminal domain during the md simulations. this domain is plastic possibly because it is small, with just ~ <dig> amino acid residues, and is stabilized predominantly by the hydrophobic core . the plasticity of the dna/rna-binding domains makes non-specific nucleotide-binding feasible  <cit> - <cit> . such a flexible structure, in contrast to the strictly coordinated components, which obey the key-lock rule, provides the possible binding to the poly-u rna and poly-au rna sequences with a weak secondary structure  <cit> , <cit> . therefore, the plasticity that we currently observed for the nip <dig> pua-domain may presumably be its significant functional property.

the nip <dig> pua-domain has an interesting feature: the formation of salt bridges by the residues shaping the interaction with rna. possibly, this effect allows the conformation of chain side groups of these residues to stabilize so as to facilitate binding to rna. it is encouraging that a similar effect of the stabilization of the side group amino acids at the expense of the formation of rigidifying salt bridges has been observed in the active centre of acylphosphatase from pyrococcus horikoshii <cit> . this is pertinent to our current observations: such a mechanism is to a great extent characteristic of the model for the deep-water nip7-aby protein.

the n-terminal domain, on the whole, is subject to smaller fluctuations compared to the c-terminal domain . in this connection, the structurally unstable segments of this domain  are outstanding. two of these segments are β-hairpins , the deviations from the crystal structure in these segments occur without significant changes in the secondary structure, so that they bend in the direction of the α1-helix in the two models. these conformational changes may result from interactions in the salt bridges network  bringing close together the β-sheet and the α <dig> helix of the n-terminal domain. this interaction network may, in turn, become stabilized through the voluminous hydrophobic nucleus formed by hydrophobic residues in the centre of the β1-β <dig> strands.

in terms of the putative functional role in the n-terminal domain, it appears worthwhile to consider the loop between the second and the third α-helices . the loop is contiguous with a lengthy nonpolar region at the surface of the n-terminal domain, which extends from the α <dig> helix to the groove between the n- and c-terminal domains so that is comes to lie on the side opposite to the polar portion of the nip <dig> surface   <cit> . the conformational changes in the α2-α <dig> region may be due to the high twisting tension of the main chain in it. it undergoes a sharp bend at the very end of the short α3-helix, then forms one helix turn, which is converted into the β <dig> strand structure . the positions of the n- and c- terminal residues of this fragment are fixed by the globule of the n-terminal domain. then, the loop itself comes to lie aside from the globular domain without imposing steric constraints on the conformational changes. additional destabilizing factors for the conformation of this region are alternating polar and hydrophobic  residues, which, as a result of conformational changes in the main chain of the α2-α <dig> segment, can by turns face solvent. it may be assumed that this bend together with the lengthy region of the nonpolar surface may play an important role in the interaction of the nip <dig> protein with the exosomal protein partner  <cit> , <cit> . interestingly, prediction of the protein-protein interaction sites using 3d structure by the sppider web-server demonstrated that most residues of this region could be involved in protein-protein interactions with high probability both for the nip7-aby and nip7-fur models .

the structural lability of proteins may accomplish a role of consequence in molecular recognition. for example, the regions of the polypeptide chain of the monomers devoid of an orderly structure can provide the protein interaction  <cit>  and adopt an orderly conformation in the process of binding  <cit> . with respect to the nip <dig> protein, intrinsic flexibility appears to be more likely  <cit>  because it ensures the presence of a conformational ensemble required for the formation of rna-protein and protein-protein interactions  <cit> .

 <dig>  comparison of the protein dynamics between the shallow- and deep-water organisms
the sequences of p. abyssi and p. furiosus nip <dig> in the 3d structure differ by  <dig> substitutions ;  <dig> of them result in radical changes of the physico-chemical properties of amino acids. these substitutions may be assigned to categories i-v.

 substitutions resulting in the replacement of a polar residue in p. abyssi by a nonpolar in p. furiosus :  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> .

  p. abyssi → p. furiosus substitutions, which result in replacement of a charged amino acid by an uncharged one at retained polarity :  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> .

 substitutions of nonpolar amino acids in p. abyssi by polar ones in p. furiosus :  <dig> .

  p. abyssi → p. furiosus substitutions of the uncharged polar side group by the charged side group:  <dig> .

 substitutions p. abyssi → p. furiosus resulting in the change of the charge sign to the opposite one :  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> .

as a result of such substitutions, the hydrophobic portion of sas increased in the shallow-water organism compared with its deep-water counterpart. the question then was: how could this influence the stability, dynamics and functional properties of the proteins? true, both proteins, in all the conditions we examined, proved to be stable and had a similar conformation. however it was perplexing to single out a parameter in the dynamics that could be significantly influenced by these substitutions.

it will be remembered that the majority of substitutions that belong to categories i and ii lie in the n-terminal domain of the protein, they are in contact with its surface region, which contains mobile residues , also residues at positions α2-α <dig>  and it may presumably be involved in protein-protein interactions .

the substitutions we observed in the n-terminal domain may, probably, somehow modify the interaction character of this region with its molecular partner. substitutions in this stretch are associated with increase in hydrophobicity of residues in the shallow-water organisms. changes of such kind can promote the stabilization of protein interaction of nip <dig> and its partner. this is because hydrophobic interactions contribute considerably to the stability of protein-protein interfaces  <cit> . another fact will be remembered here. when pressure close to atmospheric and temperature rises, hydrophobic interactions favor closer interactions of nonpolar protein regions  <cit> , which can additionally stabilize the nip7-exosome protein complex in p. furiosus. if so, the observed substitutions may truly be of adaptive character. we have previously analyzed  <cit>  the indices of asymmetry for amino acid substitutions in hundreds of pyrococcus proteins starting from its common deep-sea ancestor p. furiosus, p. horikoshii and p. abyssi to the extant shallow-sea organism p. furiosus. according to the results, the values of the indices are positively correlated with the scales of amino acid hydrophobicity and negatively with the polarity scales indicating that polar residues were predominantly substituted by nonpolar when the shallow-sea habitats replaced the deep-sea ones. however, the issue as to whether this trend is a reflection of the stabilization of protein-protein interactions or of the entire structure requires further study.

furthermore, the character of changes in fluctuations for the chain stretch in the α2-α <dig> region at increasing pressure is drastically different for the two proteins: they significantly increase in the shallow-water protein and decrease, conversely, in its deep-water counterpart . a general decrease in fluctuations throughout the entire n-terminal domain at increasing pressure is also characteristic of the deep-sea protein. the magnitude of fluctuations for efficient binding must be within definite limits and their general decrease at reduction in pressure is also additive in the deep-water protein.

substitutions exert a significant influence on the conformational parameters in proteins connecting two protein domains  in the β6-α <dig> region. this is the stretch that joins together two protein domains. probably, mutations in it favor change in the mutual orientation of the domains and result in an increase in the structural deviations in the c-terminal domain of the protein in the nip7-fur as compared with the nip7-aby model .

as for the rna-binding domain, radical changes that could alter residue charge are characteristic of the shallow-water protein. as a consequence, the formation of certain salt bridges, those between residues involved in rna recognition in particular, is impaired. it is also worth to note, that the number of residues associated with significant differences in rmsdl/rmsf parameters between the shallow- and deep-water protein models are higher in the rna-binding domain. the differences we observed in the course of md simulations may reflect the different ways and means rna interacts with the nip <dig> proteins at high and low pressures.

CONCLUSIONS
the md simulations we performed currently for the nip <dig> protein from the shallow-water  and deep-water  marine hyperthermophylic archaea demonstrated that their structures are stable at different temperatures  and pressures . increase in temperatures and pressures caused conformational changes in about the same protein regions, in the loops first of all. in the examined ranges of temperatures and pressures, increase in temperature had a more pronounced effect on changes in the dynamic properties of the protein globule than increase in pressure. a number of highly mobile segments of protein globule presumably involved in protein-protein interactions were identified. substitutions of the polar residues in the deep-water organisms by hydrophobic in the shallow-water ones were observed in some of the regions. these replacements may be evidence of change in the interaction pattern of the nip <dig> protein and the proteins of the exosome complex in the course of the divergence of the shallow-water organisms from the deep-water ones. taken together, the results of such a complex comparative analysis of the md of proteins from organisms belonging to different ecological niches may be useful in refining ideas of their functioning and adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.
