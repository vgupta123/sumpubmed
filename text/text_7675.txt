BACKGROUND
p. aeruginosa is a versatile gram-negative bacterium mainly implicated in pneumonia in intensive care settings and in patients with neutropenia, advanced aids, bronchiectasis, hereditary cystic fibrosis  disease and advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . hospital-acquired pneumonia  occurs predominantly in patients with intubation and mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit   <cit> . the risk of fatality in these patients is generally high but variable even with the correct use of antibiotics. similarly to other infectious agents, exposure to p. aeruginosa results in a range of mild to severe clinical symptoms which can lead to fatal bacteremia in critically ill patients  <cit> .

in general, the pathophysiology of human infections is a complex and dynamic process that depends on several factors: the genetic predisposition, the co-morbid conditions, the host immune response, the type of pathogen, and the site and extent of infection  <cit> . most of the studies in the field of p. aeruginosa have been concentrated on the type of strains and the virulence factors . a major contributing cause of p. aeruginosa predominance and pathogenesis was attributed to its ability to adapt to many different environments and cause a wide range of diseases in humans  <cit> . less attention has been paid to host genetic predisposition as a contributing factor to the clinical outcome of p. aeruginosa infection. however, evidence of genetic predisposition is emerging in the cf and copd populations. in cf, it has been shown that the progression and severity of pulmonary disease do not appear to correlate exclusively with specific mutations in the causative gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  but appear to be largely dependent on other modifier genes  <cit> . in copd, several host candidate genes have been proposed as causing the acceleration of lung function decline but have never been associated with p. aeruginosa infection  <cit> . regarding other patients at risk of p. aeruginosa infection, no study has yet been reported. the size of cohorts, strong but often unknown environmental influences, poor diagnosis, and lack of repeatability limit scientific advancements in understanding the genetic basis of susceptibility to p. aeruginosa diseases in humans.

inbred mice, with defined and reproducible genetics, can be maintained in standardized environments and exposed to identical challenges, unlike human populations. these aspects allow us to directly correlate the phenotypic response to the specific genotype. inbred mice have been successfully adopted to allow us to understand the genetic basis of differential susceptibility to infections   <cit> . when genes are identified in a mouse model, human orthologue genes can subsequently be identified. in the context of p. aeruginosa infection, variability in survival, magnitude of inflammatory response, bacterial clearance and lung damage have been reported in various inbred strains . recently, we also showed that the genetic background of the host influences the response to p. aeruginosa infection  <cit> . these data were obtained by ranking nine inbred murine strains characterized by a wealth of genetic and phenotypic diversity. in particular, a/j and c3h/heouj showed the most deviant clinical  and immunological phenotypes . these results provided a basis for mapping genomic regions underlying host susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection. among different traits recorded, mortality caused by bacteremia was considered as the ultimate clinical expression of the deleterious clash between the host immune response and invasive microorganisms. consequently, in this study we generated an informative f <dig> population by crossing between the parental strains, including resistant c3h/heouj and susceptible a/j mice and subsequently performed quantitative trait loci  mapping analysis. we identified a genetic locus on murine chromosome  <dig>  designated p. aeruginosa infection resistance locus  <dig> , that has major effect on the susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection and risk of bacteremia.

methods
ethic statement
animal studies were conducted according to protocols approved by san raffaele scientific institute  institutional animal care and use committee  and adhered strictly to the italian ministry of health guidelines for the use and care of experimental animals . research on the bacterial isolates aa <dig>  from the individual with cf, used for animal experiments, has been approved by the ethics commission of hannover medical school, germany. the patients and parents gave informed verbal consent before the sample collection. approval for storing of biological materials was obtained by the ethics commission of hannover medical school, germany.

bacterial strain
p. aeruginosa clinical isolate aa <dig> was described before  <cit> . the strain was cultured in trypticase soy broth  and plated on trypticase soy agar .

mice, breeding and p. aeruginosa lung infection
based on our previous study, we have determined that a/j and c3h/heouj are susceptible and resistant to p. aeruginosa infection  <cit> , respectively 7– <dig> weeks old male and female mice of a/j and c3h/heouj were purchased from jackson laboratory, and used as the parental founders of f <dig> mapping population. an outcross between the two founders was conducted and subsequently the members of the first generation  were intercrossed to generate  <dig>  f <dig> mice. a/j,  c3h/heouj , and  f <dig> mice  were intratracheal injected with a dose of 5 ×  <dig> of the planktonic p. aeruginosa clinical isolate aa <dig>  and monitored for survival up to 7 days according with established procedures  <cit> .

mice were maintained in pathogen free conditions during breeding and transferred in biosafety level  <dig> stabulary for infection experiments. mice were observed daily for clinical signs including coat quality, posture, ambulation, and hydration status.

statistical significance by mantel-cox test was performed to compare the survival between pairs. the data are pooled at least from three independent experiments.

genotyping
we applied a selective genotyping approach, as suggested by darvasi and soller  <cit> , whose power was successfully proven and confirmed in several previous studies . we genotyped only the phenotypic extremes of the entire f <dig> outcross population. a total of  <dig> mice of the f <dig> population  were genotyped and genotypes were randomized by meiosis.

high molecular genomic dna samples of the 160 f <dig> mice and the parental mouse strains were extracted from tail biopsies with the dneasy blood and tissue . samples were analyzed for purity  and dna content was evaluated by nanodrop measurement. the genomic dna samples of the f <dig> progeny were genotyped with megamuga mouse array which consists  <dig>  snp markers based on the illumina® infinium platform  <cit> . the snp genotype was conducted at neogen company . the snp markers are distributed across the entire genome with an average spacing of  <dig> kb.

qtl analysis
to map qtl contributing to survival, we used haley-knott regression  <cit> , including sex as an additive covariate . statistical significance was assessed by a permutation test  <cit> , correcting for the multiple statistical tests inherent in the scan of the genome. sample size was chosen to give 80 % power to detect a qtl explaining ~5 % of the phenotypic variance. a confidence interval for the location of the inferred qtl was derived as a  <dig> -lod support interval  <cit> . calculations were performed with r/qtl  <cit> , an add-on package to the general statistical software r .

candidate genes analysis
the public database mouse genome informatics  was used for the identification of suggested genes within the qtl interval and for prioritization together with endeavour  <cit> . to generate the training sets of genes employed for the analysis, we used the ‘key word’ approach described previously  <cit> .

statistical analysis
we used mantel-cox test to compare the survival between pairs. tests were considered statistically significant when the significance level was ≤  <dig> .

RESULTS
susceptibility to p. aeruginosa pulmonary infection in  f <dig> progenies
our experiments established that the intratracheal injection of 5 × 106 cfu of the p. aeruginosa clinical isolate aa <dig> causes the death of a/j mice within 24 h, whereas a set of c3h/heouj mice  survives for more than 7 days . the selected a/j and c3h/heouj parental inbred mouse strains were highly and significantly divergent in the risk of sepsis . to analyse the potential contribution of genetic factors to p. aeruginosa infection, the f <dig> population and subsequently  <dig>  f <dig> mice were generated by reciprocal mating of susceptible a/j and resistant c3h/heouj mice. the entire f <dig> population was infected with p. aeruginosa as described above and survival of each mouse was recorded over a period of 7 days post-infection. f <dig> progenies showed a survival which was significantly higher than the susceptible strain a/j, but lower when compared to c3h/heouj parental lines . then, to collect data for the subsequent genome analysis, the f <dig> population was sorted based on the phenotypic extremes - the most susceptible   and most resistant   -. the selected f2-s showed a significantly lower survival compared to c3h/heouj mice  but similar to a/j mice  while f2-r showed a significantly higher survival compared to the parental c3h/heouj  and a/j mice . the rest of the f <dig> population  showed survival kinetics that were significantly different from f2-s and f <dig> -r  and the parental lines . finally the entire f <dig> population  showed a significantly higher survival compared to the parental a/j  a slightly significantly lower survival when compared to the parental c3h/heouj . the complete statistical analysis is reported in additional file  <dig> . the distribution histogram of the survival time in the f <dig> population, with values ranging from  <dig>  to 7 days, is shown in fig. 2b, along with the distribution in a/j mice  and c3h/heouj mice .fig.  <dig> survival curves of a/j, c3h/heouj and  f <dig> population after acute p. aeruginosa lung infection. a/j , c3h/heouj , and  f <dig> mice  were intratracheal injected with a dose of 5 ×  <dig> of the planktonic p. aeruginosa clinical isolate aa <dig>  and monitored for survival up to 168 h . statistical significance by mantel-cox test is reported in additional file 1

additional analysis showed that high numbers of cfus  were present in the moribund mice, both parental and their progenies, indicating sepsis as the cause of death .

mapping the genetic determinants to p. aeruginosa susceptibility
in the next phase, we proceeded to map the genetic factors that contributed to susceptibility to the p. aeruginosa acute lung infection. the survival time was used as the main phenotypic trait for mapping qtl associated with host susceptibility to this opportunistic pathogen. in order to maximize the ability to detect the qtls, we took advantage of the selective genotyping approach, described previously  <cit>  and successfully applied in several studies . the phenotypic extremes f2-s and f2-r were genotyped with about 10 k informative snp markers selected from megamuga snp array, and subsequently qtl mapping was performed. we identified a significant qtl on chromosome  <dig>  at map position  <dig>  mbp with lod score =  <dig> , and with a  <dig> -lod support genomic interval of  <dig> – <dig>  mbp . the snps markers used to genotype the locus of interest on chromosome  <dig> are reported in additional file  <dig> . we defined the mapped qtl on chromosome  <dig> as pairl <dig> for p. aeruginosa infection resistance locus  <dig> fig.  <dig> qtl scan showing lod score  and genome position  for susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection. the x axis shows chromosome numbers, the y axis shows the statistical significance of the association measured as lod, logarithm of the odds favouring linkage, a score that measures the strength of evidence for the presence of a qtl among the  <dig> mice of the f <dig> population, including f2-s and f2-r. the horizontal line is plotted at the 5 % significance threshold. one significant qtl  named pairl  <dig> was mapped on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mbp with  <dig>  lod score, with a  <dig> -lod drop support interval of  <dig> – <dig>  mbp



the effect of the locus on survival is presented in additional file  <dig> . the locus shows some degree of over-dominance, with the heterozygotes surviving longer than the homozygotes  and a transgressive allele segregation with the a/j homozygotes surviving longer than the c3h/heouj homozygotes. this is the opposite what would be expected from the parental strains’ phenotypes.

identification and functional classification of candidate genes
a total of  <dig> genes within the pairl <dig> interval were identified from the public database , as described in material and methods and classified as protein coding genes , rna genes , unclassified genes  and unclassified non-coding rna genes . the full list of genes in the interval is reported in additional file  <dig> . gene prioritization was: i) carried out by integrative computational analysis of public and private genomic data  <cit> , ii) based on training lists of genes involved in relevant biological and pathological processes and iii) ranked based on literature research.

to prioritize our genes, we used endeavour and the mgi database . for endeavour, candidates genes are first ranked according to their similarity to a list of known disease training genes involved in lung infection, bacteremia, pneumonia, sepsis, chemotaxis, p. aeruginosa, innate immune response, pattern recognition receptor, neutrophils, complement, cf, modifier genes in cf, and copd . for the mgi database, we based the search on different keywords  and gene ontology terms  . interestingly, the two different approaches revealed several redundant genes and consequently, we proceeded with a systematic literature research to confirm a possible role in susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection. the candidate genes in table  <dig> are those revealed by the literature research as having a putative role in host defense to infection. in particular, the most promising candidate genes  were those involved in pathogen sensing, neutrophils and macrophages recruitment, and inflammatory process. our prioritization of results depends on the adopted criteria for the bioinformatics analysis and on the bioinformatics tool itself. therefore, it cannot be excluded that other possible candidate genes present in our list could somehow play a role in p. aeruginosa infection.table  <dig> the list of the most promising candidate genes identified in the pairl <dig> locus

discussion
phenotypic variations of host response to p. aeruginosa infection have been demonstrated in several inbred mouse strains  and in the most recent collaborative cross population  <cit> . in our earlier work, we showed that classical inbred strains of mice manifest an extreme response - highly resistant or highly susceptible - to p. aeruginosa infection  <cit> . in particular, the risk of fatality in a/j mice was high after exposure to p. aeruginosa while c3h/heouj showed milder clinical symptoms associated to higher resolution of the infection. however, the genetic component of this trait is still poorly understood. for the first time to our knowledge, in this study, we localized a genetic determinant of susceptibility to p. aeruginosa respiratory infection. first, we generated an informative f <dig> population by crossing the resistant c3h/heouj and susceptible a/j mice. next, we scored this f <dig> population for survival time, as the main associated disease phenotypic trait, and subsequently used it for qtl mapping. the p. aeruginosa dose for infection of the newly generated populations was selected according to the most deviant differences in survival between parental lines. the f <dig> population showed a wide range of responses in terms of survival compared to the parental lines. for this study, we used p. aeruginosa isolate sampled at the onset of infection from a cf patient and fully characterized in previous studies . although the p. aeruginosa strain was selected on the basis of its similarity to environmental strains, including genotypic and phenotypic features, it is possible that this particular strain may affect several physiological parameters and subsequent analysis.

our genetic linkage approach was successful in identifying for the first time the pairl <dig> locus, on murine chromosome  <dig>  linked to susceptibility to p. aeruginosa pulmonary infection with a genome wide significance of 95 % . here, the gene prioritization approach was used to rank genes involved in the susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection. this approach was applied successfully in candidate gene analysis in other diseases such as obesity, type  <dig> diabetes, and asthma  <cit> . the most promising candidate genes included in the pairl <dig> locus, namely dok <dig>  tacr <dig>  cd <dig>  clec4f, gp <dig>  gata <dig> and foxp <dig>  are mainly involved in pathogen sensing, neutrophils recruitment and cytokines response.

in more detail, as dok <dig>  belongs to a family of adaptor proteins, it plays a critical anti-inflammatory role in lung homeostasis. it is involved in negative regulation of lps signaling and its expression is downregulated after p. aeruginosa infection in vitro  <cit> . together with dok  <dig> and dok  <dig>  it plays essential roles in negative regulation of a wide variety of signaling pathways in both innate and adaptive immunities  <cit> . mice knock-out for dok <dig> were hypersensitive to lps showing high levels of tnfα and no  <cit>  while triple ko mice  showed spontaneous pulmonary inflammation, with hallmarks of asthma, including eosinophilia, goblet cell hyperplasia, and subepithelial fibrosis  <cit> . most importantly, downregulation of dok <dig> gene expression in human alveolar macrophages after p. aeruginosa infection in vitro, indicates its direct involvement in this bacterial infection  <cit> .

the gene tacr <dig>  encodes the receptor for the neuropeptide tachykinin and is implicated in mediating a variety of proinflammatory processes, including upregulation of cytokine and chemokine expression, chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cells, all pathways that seem to be altered in susceptible a/j mice during acute p. aeruginosa infection  <cit> . moreover, the binding of this receptor with its ligand has been shown to increase the neutrophils adhesion to bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> . more interestingly, tacr <dig> has been implicated in several bacterial infections and in sepsis  <cit> , including p. aeruginosa corneal infection  <cit> .

cd <dig>  gene encodes a type ii transmembrane, c-type lectin receptor displaying mannose-binding specificity. it has high affinity for mannose structures abundantly expressed by pathogens, especially by viruses  as well as the mycobacterial cell wall component mannosylated lipoarabinomannan  and pathogenic funguses such as candida species, malassezia furfur and saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . the gene clec4f shows high similarity with cd <dig>  and therefore might be involved in the same processes. the importance of these genes in the context of p. aeruginosa infection might be seen in the functional association of this c-type lectin receptor with the mannose binding lectin  <dig>  gene, which codes for the mbl, a well-known modifier gene in cf. in fact, polymorphisms in mbl <dig> are associated with differing level of mbl production, and deficiencies in mbl production have been linked to an increased incidence of infection,  <cit> . in particular it predisposes to early infection with p. aeruginosa which in turn, leads to more severe lung disease  <cit> .

interestingly, other candidates in the pairl <dig> locus play important roles in leukocytes recruitment. specifically, gp <dig> , expressed by platelets, is involved in leukocyte migration, inflammation and promotion of neutrophil extracellular trap formation  <cit> . in a mouse model of sepsis this glycoprotein complex contributes to a platelet/neutrophil and platelet/monocyte axis with significant consequences to the innate immune response in terms of elevated serum cytokine levels and mac <dig> increased expression by neutrophils for their extracellular cell migration. among the candidate genes, we also identified the transcription factors foxp <dig>  and gata <dig>  that are involved in pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, such as il1ß, il- <dig> and il-17ra correlated to the th <dig> pathway   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we suggest promising candidates for the genetic basis of host susceptibility to p. aeruginosa infection. in addition to a better understanding of host pathogen interactions, the characterization of these genes may have significant implications for the discovery of novel possible therapeutic targets and/or prognostic biomarkers complementing human studies.
