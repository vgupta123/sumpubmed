BACKGROUND
plant defensins are cationic peptides that are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and belong to a large superfamily of antimicrobial peptides that are found in several organisms  <cit> . the plant defensins protein family is composed of small peptides consisting of 45– <dig> amino acids and are encompassed in a three-dimensional structure containing three anti-parallel β-strands and one α-helix  <cit> . the three-dimensional structure is stabilized by four disulfide bridges formed by eight strictly conserved cysteine residues. two of these bridges compose the cysteine-stabilized α-helix β-strand motif that is also found in other peptides with similar biological activities  <cit> .

the antimicrobial activity of plant defensins was first reported in the early 1990s by terras et al.  <cit> . the antimicrobial activity of plant defensins has been observed mainly against fungi; however, some bacteria, especially gram-positive species, have also been shown to be inhibited, although the activity of defensins against bacteria is less pronounced than the activity against fungi. the growth of several fungal species, including several filamentous fungi and yeasts, is inhibited when incubated with defensins  <cit> . based on their antifungal properties, plant defensins are classified into two groups: group i includes plant defensins that inhibit hyphal elongation with morphological changes and group ii consists of those that inhibit fungal growth without morphological changes  <cit> . the antifungal activity of plant defensins appears to require specific binding targets on fungal membranes  <cit> . the molecular mechanism underlying the antimicrobial mode of action is still poorly understood, although specific targets on fungal membranes have been identified for the defensins from raphanus sativus l. and dahlia merckii <cit> .

phaseolus vulgaris l. was originally cultivated in the new world but is now grown extensively in all major continental areas  <cit> . it is a principal dietary component and protein source for more than  <dig> million people in latin america and western and south africa  <cit> . brazil is the largest producer of common beans, and the cultivation of this crop is socially important because it is farmed as a subsistence crop and is the main source of income for small farmers  <cit> .

previously, games et al.  <cit>  isolated and characterized a plant defensin from the seeds of p. vulgaris named pvd <dig> , and this defensin exhibited antifungal activity against different yeast strains. this same study also reported the cloning of pvd <dig> cdna by rt-pcr. in the present study, we continue to explore the function of pvd <dig> by demonstrating the functional expression and antimicrobial activity of the recombinant form of pvd <dig> . additionally, through the use of a mutant yeast strain deficient in sphingolipid synthesis, we begin to elucidate the membrane target of pvd <dig> 

methods
materials
phaseolus vulgaris l. seeds were supplied by the empresa de pesquisa agropecuária do estado do rio de janeiro – pesagro, campos dos goytacazes, rj, brazil.

the cdna encoding the defensin pvd <dig> was obtained as described by  <cit> .

chemically competent cells of the escherichia coli bacterial strains jm  <dig> ]  and rosetta-gami  <dig>  plyss  gor522::tn <dig> trxb plyssrare <dig> 4)]  were used. luria-bertani  medium was used as a routine bacterial growth and expression medium.

candida albicans mutant strain gcs <dig>  deficient on glucosyl ceramide synthase  enzyme, was kindly provided by dr. dirk warnecke from the institut fur allgemeine botanik, university of hamburg, germany, and was obtained from the instituto de biofísica carlos chagas filho, universidade federal do rio de janeiro, rio de janeiro, brazil. yeast cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar .

extraction and purification of the pvd <dig> from p. vulgaris seeds
the natural defensin from p. vulgaris seeds, pvd <dig>  was purified as follows. fine flour  was prepared from the seeds of p. vulgaris in a mill. a protein extract was prepared from this flour using 500 ml of extraction buffer  for 2 h at 4°c with constant agitation. this protein extract was centrifuged at  <dig>  g, and the supernatant was fractionated at a 70% relative ammonium sulfate saturation at 4°c for 18 h. after centrifugation under the same conditions, the precipitate was redissolved in distilled water and heated at 80°c for 15 min in a water bath. this heated protein extract was centrifuged at  <dig>  g. the supernatant was recovered and extensively dialyzed against distilled water for three days and then recovered by freeze drying. for peptides, purification was initially performed on a deae-sepharose column  equilibrated with 20 mm tris–hcl  at flow rate of 60 ml/h. the freeze dried protein extract  was reconstituted in 5 ml of the equilibrium buffer and centrifuged , and the supernatant was loaded onto the column. a non-retained fraction  was eluted in the equilibrium buffer, and a bound fraction  was eluted in the same buffer with 1 m nacl. the d <dig> fraction was freeze dried to concentrate, resuspended in  <dig> %  trifluoroacetic acid  and injected into an hplc c2c <dig> reversed-phase column  attached to a c <dig> guard column . the bound peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient starting with 100% solvent a  for 10 min followed by a mixture of solvent a and solvent b  from  <dig> to 100% for 48 min and was then washed with 100% solvent b for 10 min. the concentration of solvent a rose to 100% following the 60 min total chromatography run, as shown by games et al.  <cit> .

construction of the recombinant expression vector
the strategic design for the expression vector was based on the amplification of the cdna encoding pvd <dig> using a specific set of primers that were designed to allow the amplicon to be cloned into a pet- <dig> ek/lic expression vector . this vector is part of a system for the expression of recombinant proteins that are fused to the thioredoxin , which facilitates protein solubility. additionally, this vector provides six consecutive histidines  and glutathione  tags for the purification and identification of recombinant proteins. after purification, all tags can be completely removed via a cleavage reaction with the endoproteinase enterokinase , and the proteolytic site is provided by the vector.

fragment preparation for cloning into the expression vector
one set of primers was designed for the cloning of pvd <dig> into the pet- <dig> ek/lic vector, according to the manufacturer’s instruction. the primers were as follows: 5′-gacgacgacaagatgaagacgtgcgagaacctg-3′ for the sense primer  and 5′-gaggagaagcccggtttaacagtttttggt-3′ for the antisense primer . the bold letters correspond to the sequence that anneals to the coding sequence of the pvd <dig> cdna, and the underlined letters correspond to the sequence that anneals to the vector and were introduced to generate specific overhangs that would anneal with the pet- <dig> ek/lic vector after treatment with t <dig> dna polymerase. the double waves indicate a methionine codon, which was included according to the instructions furnished by the manufacturer . this strategy permits directional cloning without the need for restriction digestion or ligation by a process called ligation-independent cloning . the primers were synthesized by invitrogen, usa/life technologies, brazil.

pcrs for fragment amplification were performed with a mastercycler gradient  <dig> , and the pcr mixture contained 1× fidelitaq buffer ,  <dig>  mm dntps, 20 μm ds, 20 μm das, 1 μl of cdna, and  <dig>  units of fidelitaq dna polymerase i  in a final volume of 20 μl per reaction. the reactions were initially warmed at 95°c for  <dig>  min, followed by  <dig> °c for 45 s, 68°c for  <dig>  min, 35 cycles of the following program: 95°c for 45 s,  <dig> °c for 45 s, and 68°c for  <dig>  min.

the pcr products were directly purified with wizard sv gel and a pcr clean-up system , according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and were treated with t <dig> dna polymerase to generate overhang ends that were compatible with the vector. the t <dig> dna polymerase reactions contained the following reagents: 300 ng of the purified fragment, 1× t <dig> dna polymerase buffer , 66 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dtt),  <dig>  mm datp, 5 mm dtt, and  <dig> units of t <dig> dna polymerase in a 20 μl reaction. the reactions were incubated at 22°c for 30 min, and subsequently, the t <dig> dna polymerase was inactivated by incubating the reactions at 75°c for 20 min.

pet- <dig> ek/lic preparation and annealing
the pet- <dig> ek/lic vector was furnished by the manufacturer and annealed to the fragment encoding the defensin, which was prepared as described above. the annealing reaction consisted of 50 ng of pet- <dig> ek/lic and 2 μl of the t <dig> dna polymerase-treated fragment. the reaction was incubated at 22°c for 5 min, and 1 μl of 25 mm edta was subsequently added, followed by a second incubation at 22°c for 5 min. from this reaction, 1 μl was used for bacterial  transformation.

transformation and colony screening
the transformation of jm  <dig> competent cells was performed as described by inoue et al.  <cit> , and the screening was performed by a plasmid extraction and digestion . the resulting dna construct was named pet-pvd <dig>  after successful cloning was confirmed, the construct pet-pvd <dig> was used to transform the super-expression strain of e. coli rosetta-gami  <dig>  plyss competent cells, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. screening was performed by pcr directly from the bacterial colonies as follows: three colonies were randomly selected from the agar plate using sterile pipette tips, transferred to pcr tubes that contained 10 μl of sterile water, and homogenated with the pipette tips. ten microliters of a mixture that contained 1× taq buffer ,  <dig>  mm dntps, 20 μm ds, 20 μm das, and  <dig>  units fidelitaq dna polymerase i  were added to these tubes to yield a final volume of 20 μl. these reactions were submitted for pcr analysis. the pcr products were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel.

pvd1r expression and purification
the transformed cells were grown at 37°c in liquid lb medium  supplemented with ampicillin  and chloramphenicol  to an optical density  of  <dig>  before induction with 1 mm iptg. after 3 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation ; suspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer  containing 500 mm nacl, 40 mm imidazole, 1 mm pmsf, and a protease inhibitor cocktail for general use , according to the manufacturer’s manual; and ruptured by sonication  . next, the cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation  , and the supernatant was heated at 90°c for 30 min. the resulting suspension was centrifuged , and the supernatant was purified further by chromatographic methods.

initially, ni+-nta agarose resin  was used to purify the soluble fusion protein by affinity chromatography. the ni+-nta agarose resin was equilibrated with a 50 mm phosphate buffer  that contained 500 mm nacl and 40 mm imidazole. the bound fraction was eluted with 500 mm imidazole in a 50 mm phosphate buffer . to separate pvd1r from the tags  provided by the vector, cleavage of the fusion protein was performed by incubating the bound fraction with recombinant bovine enterokinase  for 16 h at 25°c, according to the manufacturer’s instruction. after cleavage, this fraction was resubmitted for affinity chromatography on ni+-nta agarose resin under the conditions described above. at this point, the recombinant defensin had lost affinity to the ni+ because it did not have the his tag and was therefore found in the unbounded fraction. this purified pvd1r was submitted to the c2c <dig> reversed-phase column exactly as described in the purification of the natural pvd <dig> and the retention time was recorded. in the second round of purification of the pvd1r, the cleavage sample was applied directly into the c2c <dig> reversed-phase column, and the peak with the same retention time of the pvd1r, as previously recorded, was collected.

the purification process was monitored by sds-tricine gel electrophoresis performed according to the method of schägger and von jagow  <cit> .

pvd1r amino acid sequencing
the purified pvd1r that was obtained after ni+ affinity chromatography underwent edman automated n-terminal amino acid sequencing  <cit>  on a shimadzu ppsq- <dig> automated protein sequencer. the sequence was determined from the purified peptide that was blotted onto pvdf membranes after sds-tricine gel electrophoresis. pth-amino acids were detected at 269 nm after separation on a reverse-phase c <dig> column  under isocratic conditions, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the sequences were compared to sequences reported in amino acid data banks and were submitted for automatic alignment using the ncbi-blast search system.

modeling
the three-dimensional structure of pvd1r was modeled with the modeller program  <cit> . initially, a search of a protein sequence databank was performed using the sequence of the pvd1r as a query in blastp  <cit> . based on this analysis, the vigna radiata defensin  <dig>  was selected as the template. the pvd1r model was generated, and minimization of energy  was performed to optimize the geometric parameters of the model. the minimization of the model was achieved using the gromos <dig> swiss-pdb viewer program. the stereochemical quality of the models was checked using the ramachandran plots  and profile 3d, both of which were available on the parmodel web server  <cit> , and several parameters were analyzed, including the peptide bonds, planarity of the rings of the side chains, and twist angles ϕ and ψ of the main chain.

candida albicans growth inhibition assay
for the preparation of the yeast cell cultures, an inoculum was transferred to petri dishes that contained potato dextrose agar, and the inoculates were allowed to grow on the plates at 30°c for 2 days. next, the cells were transferred to sterile culture medium . the yeast cells were quantified in a neubauer chamber for further calculations of appropriate dilutions. a quantitative assay for yeast growth inhibition was performed according to the protocol developed previously by broekaert et al.  <cit> , with some modifications. to monitor the effects of pvd <dig> and pvd1r on the growth of fungal cells, the cells were incubated in microplates at 30°c, at a final volume of 200 μl , and in the presence or absence  of pvd <dig> and pvd1r . optical readings at 620 nm were taken at timepoint zero and at every 6 h for the following 24 h. the readings were taken against a blank that contained only the culture medium. all of the experiments were run in triplicate, and the reading averages, standard errors and coefficients of variation were calculated.

optical microscopy analysis and localization of pvd1r conjugated to fitc in candida albicans cells
for optical microscopy analysis, after a 24 h yeast growth inhibition assay with pvd <dig> and pvd1r, the yeast cells were separated from the growth medium by centrifugation , washed in potato dextrose broth and visualized with an optical microscope . the yeast cells that were grown in the absence of defensins were also analyzed.

for localization analysis, pvd1r was conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate , according to the manufacturer’s instructions for fitc . the nuclei were stained with 50 μg.ml- <dig> of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride  for 10 min, which was followed by fluorescence analysis with image analysis software  and an axioplan zeiss microscope.

RESULTS
protein expression and purification
the coding sequence of the mature p. vulgaris seed defensin, obtained via pcr amplification  <cit> , was inserted into the pet- <dig> ek/lic expression vector . the resulting construct, named pet-pvd <dig>  was subsequently transformed into the e. coli jm  <dig> strain. positive colonies were screened by plasmid extraction and digestion, and the construct pet-pvd <dig> was used to transform the overexpressing e. coli strain rosetta-gami  <dig>  plyss. following an induction by iptg, the strain transformed with pet-pvd <dig> expressed, as confirmed by sds-tricine gel electrophoresis, a fusion protein with a molecular mass above the approximately  <dig>  kda marker that corresponded to the pvd1r fused with both the trx and his tags  . after induction, the soluble cell extract, containing trx-his-pvd1r, was initially fractionated via metal affinity chromatography on a ni+-nta agarose column and two different peaks were observed . the first was unbound to the resin and corresponded to the fractions that do not present affinity to the ni+ , and the second bound to the resin  and presented proteins that had an affinity to the ni+ . the bound fraction, as analyzed by sds-tricine gel electrophoresis, contained pvd1r bound to ni+ by the his tag, . in this same lane, low molecular mass contaminants that also present affinity to ni+ were observed . the bound fraction  containing trx-his-pvd1r was submitted to treatment with the recombinant bovine enterokinase to split the trx-his tags from pvd1r . analysis by sds-tricine gel electrophoresis showed that after the enterokinase treatment, the band above the  <dig>  kda marker disappeared and a protein band of approximately 6 kda appeared . the enterokinase treated sample was subsequently recovered and resubmitted to the ni+-nta agarose column, as described above, to achieve a final purification of pvd1r. once again, two peaks were obtained, one unbound and one bound . here the unbound fraction corresponded to the pvd1r that had lost affinity to the ni+ because it was no longer fused with the his tag . for the final purification step of pvd1r and also to confirm its purity, the cleaved sample was submitted for chromatography on a c2c <dig> reversed-phase column. purified pvd1r was passed on this column by second metal affinity chromatography, and the retention time of pvd1r was recorded. the chromatogram presented two main peaks, and the peak corresponding to the retention time of the pvd1r was collected . sds-tricine gel electrophoresis showed only one band of approximately 6 kda .

amino acid sequencing
the 6 kda peptide underwent automated n-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the analysis of its eight n-terminal amino acids, counted after the first methionine, matched exactly the first eight n-terminal amino acid sequence of the defensin from p. vulgaris seeds, pvd <dig>  as previously described by games et al.  <cit> . the obtained partial n-terminal sequence and the first eight n-terminal sequences of pvd <dig> differed in only one amino acid residue, an initial methionine, which was added intentionally as a requirement for protein expression via the pet- <dig> ek/lic system. the generated partial n-terminal sequence of the 6 kda peptide clearly demonstrated that the overall process of recombinant production of pvd1r, including the cleavage with the enterokinase, was successful .

modeling
in figure  <dig> we present a model of the structure of the recombinant defensin pvd1r. first, the amino acid sequence alignment between the pvd1r and the selected template, the defensin from v. radiata , is shown and demonstrates that these sequences differs in only three amino acids residues, as indicated by asterisks in figure 3a, thereby corresponding to 98% identity. figure 3b shows that the structure of this peptide is composed of three β-sheets and one α-helix. four disulfide bridges are present in the structure. figure 3c shows the overlap of the structures of pvd1r and the vrd <dig> defensin that was used as a model. this overlap shows that there are no significant differences between these structures, and the main differences observed are in the region of unstructured loops. figure 3d and e shows the positive residues  that are exposed on the surface of pvd1r. the quality evaluation of the model was performed by analyzing the ramachandran plots, which revealed a good stereochemistry for the model . the rmsd determined for this model was  <dig>  Å.

effect of pvd1r and pvd <dig> on wild type and mutant c. albicans growth
first, in these assays, we compared the activity of pvd1r with regard to pvd <dig>  and we showed that the biological activity of both defensins at 24 h and 100 μg.ml- <dig>  which were measured by the growth inhibition of the wild-type c. albicans strain, were  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . this result indicates that the recombinant production of pvd1r preserved its biological activity. comparing the growth of the wild type and the mutant c. albicans strains in the absence of the defensins, we observed that the mutant strain grows approximately 84% less than the wild-type c. albicans . in the presence of pvd <dig> at 100 μg.ml- <dig>  we observed that the mutant strain grew  <dig>  and  <dig> % more than the control at 6 h and 18 h, respectively. this tendency, observed in the initial hours, increased to  <dig> % of additional growth at 24 h with regards to the control . this result is further analyzed in the discussion section. in the presence of pvd1r at the same concentration, we observed a good superposition of the growth curves during the time course assayed . this result indicates that pvd1r did not present growth inhibition on the c. albicans mutant strain.

we further analyzed, through optical microscopy, possible alterations to the morphology of c. albicans cells at the end of the growth inhibition assay for both defensins. first, the wild-type and mutant strain presented contrasting growth patterns. the wild type strain presented single ovoid cells as well as long pseudohyphae . the mutant strains presented aggregated cells with short pseudohyphae and occasionally sparse cells . with regard to the effect of the defensins on these cells, we noted that in the presence of 100 μg.ml- <dig> of pvd <dig>  the wild-type cells were agglomerated and reduced in number and also presented reductions in the size of the hyphae . the mutant cells, when treated with pvd <dig>  showed very similar morphology and growth patterns compared to the control mutant cells . after treatment with 100 μg.ml- <dig> of pvd1r, wild-type c. albicans cells presented marked reductions in cell number and hyphal size as well as agglomerated cells . in comparison, the effect of pvd <dig> and pvd1r on wild-type cells was visually the same. the mutant cells treated with pvd1r presented a very similar morphology and growth pattern when compared to the control mutant cells and the mutant cells treated with pvd <dig> .

optical microscopy with the fluorescent dyes fitc and dapi
to determine the localization of pvd1r in the c. albicans wild-type and mutant strains, 50 μg.ml- <dig> of pvd1r was coupled to fitc and used in the growth inhibition assay. next, the cells were subjected to dapi labeling. in this assay, we observed that the fitc-conjugated pvd1r did not interact with the mutant strain , while in the wild-type strain, the localization of pvd1r was intracellular, as expected due to the presence of the membrane target . despite detecting the recombinant defensin pvd1r in the intracellular spaces of the wild type cells, this protein colocalize with the nucleus following dapi staining .

discussion
pvd1r was successfully expressed in e. coli  plyss expression strain). this expression system was used to produce recombinant proteins tagged with thioredoxin and six consecutive histidines . after induction with iptg, the bacteria that were transformed with pet-pvd <dig> expressed a fusion protein  above the molecular mass marker of  <dig>  kda. this mass corresponded to the molecular size of the expressed trx-his-pvd1r, as determined by sds-tricine gel electrophoresis . trx-his-pvd1r consisted of an approximately  <dig>  kda trx-his tag and a mature defensin of approximately 6 kda. it has been previously suggested that trx, an e. coli resident protein, might help to maintain the solubility of a significant fraction of expressed fusion proteins, particularly proteins that would otherwise precipitate entirely as inclusion bodies  <cit> . this is a basic requirement for the establishment of native disulfide bonds. additionally, elmorjani et al.  <cit>  reported that this strategy significantly increased the specific yielded of recombinant fusion proteins. the strategy of expressing pvd1r as a fusion protein, however, required a cleavage protocol to allow for the retrieval of the protein of interest from the fusion partner. for this reason, the trx-his-pvd1r fusion protein was submitted to alternating steps of ni+ affinity chromatography and enterokinase cleavage to remove the trx-his-tags. figure 2b  shows the electrophoretic profile of the purified recombinant protein. gel electrophoresis confirmed that the recombinant defensin had the approximately same molecular mass as the defensin that was isolated from the p. vulgaris seeds, according to games et al.  <cit> , as well as other plant defensins  <cit> .

pvd1r differed from pvd <dig> by only one amino acid residue: the initial methionine. the presence of this methionine in the n-terminal region of the pvd1r was required for protein expression using the pet- <dig> ek/lic vector .

the modeling of the structure of pvd1r was performed with vigna radiata defensin  <dig>  as a template because the primary structure of vrd <dig>  as determined by lin et al.  <cit> , showed 98% identity with the p. vulgaris seed defensin . plant defensins are small peptides  that have a molecular weight between  <dig> and 7 kda and are highly basic and cysteine-rich  <cit> . the structural conformation includes three anti-parallel β sheets and one α-helix, which are stabilized by four disulfide bridges  <cit> . the modeling showed that, like other defensins, the pvd1r defensin consisted of three β-sheets and one α-helix, and the three-dimensional structure of the peptide was stabilized by four disulfide bridges. furthermore, the positive residues  that were exposed on the surface of the molecule were important for the antifungal activity of this peptide and have been previously described in other studies  <cit> . the additional methionine did not induce alterations to the modeled structure, as shown by the superimposition of the pvd1r with its model template, thus presenting small dissimilarities mainly in the regions of unstructured loops .

to verify the functionality of pvd1r, its effects were compared with those of the natural defensin pvd <dig> in a c. albicans growth inhibition assay. a good indication that pvd1r was as biologically functional as pvd <dig> was the observation of a soluble band by gel electrophoresis that corresponded to the recombinant trx-his-pvd1r . the solubility of the recombinant protein is a good indication that both the folding and post-translation modifications, and in the case of pvd1r the formation of the disulfide bounds, were processed correctly  <cit> . furthermore, n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the overall production process of pvd1r, including the cloning of the cdna into the expression vector, folding, purification and mainly ek cleavage, was successful . all of the aforementioned evidence of the functionality of pvd1r were further confirmed by its biological activity on the wild-type c. albicans strain . games et al.  <cit>  previously showed that the natural defensin pvd <dig> could inhibit the growth of c. albicans as well as other fungi. several defensins isolated from various plants have also demonstrated similar inhibition profiles against the growth of microorganisms. thevissen et al.  <cit>  evaluated the effects of different defensins on the growth of pathogenic yeasts of the genus candida. the plant defensins hs-afp <dig> and rs-afp <dig> were both able to inhibit the growth of c. albicans and c. krusei. another defensin isolated from vigna sesquipedalis seeds showed inhibitory activity against the growth of escherichia coli, bacillus megaterium, mycobacterium phlei and proteus vulgaris bacteria  <cit> . more recently, wong et al.  <cit>  showed that a defensin isolated from the p. vulgaris cultivar king bean pole effectively inhibited the growth of mycosphaerella arachidicola, saccharomyces cerevisiae and c. albicans when used in small concentrations. with regards to the inhibition profile of recombinant defensins, several authors have demonstrated that the recombinant counterparts are as active as the natural form  <cit> . however, slight differences between the activities of the natural and recombinant defensins in tests of biological activity have been reported with different reported causes. the recombinant ax <dig>  a defensin isolated from beta vulgaris leaves, showed slight changes in biological activity tests. the authors attributed this difference in activity to the addition of an extra amino acid at the n-terminal region as required by the cloning approach  <cit> . the recombinant vrcrp, a defensin isolated from vigna radiate, presented toxicity to e. coli and could only be expressed in this system when bound to a truncated signal peptide and a chitin binding domain tag  <cit> . another peptide, called brazzein, isolated from pentadiplandra brazzeana, presented the same scaffold of the plant defensins and stimulated an intense sweet taste in primates, however, when expressed recombinantly, it presented low intensity sweetness in a sensory analysis. the authors explained that the low intensity sweetness occurred due to incorrect folding in the recombinant system  <cit> .

after confirmation that pvd1r was biologically active, we evaluated the activity of pvd <dig> and pvd1r against a Δgcs strain of c. albicans. this mutant strain lacks the gene for the enzyme gcs, a protein that is required for the formation of the sphingolipid glucosylceramide  on c. albicans. the superposition of the growth curves of the control and the test indicated that pvd <dig> and pvd1r did not present toxic effects on this strain. this result was expected because the supposition of the membrane target of this defensin is the sphingolipid glucer, which is absent in the membrane of this mutant strain. without its membrane target, pvd1r did not interact with the membrane and, consequently, did not trigger toxic effects. other fungal species that were null for the sphingolipid gene presented the same effect when incubated with the particular plant defensins that use the sphingolipids as a membrane target  <cit> .

light microscopy analysis showed morphological alterations in the wild-type strain of c. albicans treated with  <dig> μg/ml- <dig> of both pvd <dig> and pvd1r . several plant defensins were shown to induce morphological alterations in fungal cells  <cit> . these alterations include cellular agglomeration, cellular elongation, hyphae hyper-branching and mainly biomass reduction. some authors also reported that these effects vary in intensity from mild to severe and also vary in regard to the combination of plant defensin and fungal species  <cit> . with regards to the effect of pvd <dig> and pvd1r on the mutant yeast strain, no significant difference was observed . this result was expected because this yeast strain lacks the sphingolipid glucer caused by the absence of the gcs enzyme that synthesizes the sphingolipid. our results, as shown in figure  <dig>  demonstrate that cells from the mutant strain appear to have their growth stimulated in the presence of pvd <dig> but not in the presence of pvd1r. microscopy analysis clearly demonstrated aberrant growth of the mutant strain compared with the control .we believe that this aberrant growth pattern, as exhibited by the mutant strain, may increase or interfere with the optical densities that were measured during the growth inhibition assay and may have caused an apparent absence of inhibitory activity . morphological alterations, such as cell aggregation and pseudohyphae formation, which are induced by treatment with amps, can cause an anomalous optical density in the growth inhibition assay, and this parameter can be used as an indicator of fungal growth, as reported in amp cc-ltp <dig>  <cit> . the inhibition can be confirmed in these cases by observing the culture in the presence of the amp at the end of the growth inhibition assay by optical microscopy .

the biological function of pvd1r was also confirmed by fluorescence microscopy analysis. in this analysis, we show that pvd1r did not interact with the mutant strain lacking the gcs gene, and the labeled proteins were only observed outside of the cell . in sharp contrast, this labeling was observed inside the wild-type strain, indicating that the pvd1r interacts with the membrane target glucer and enters the cell . the incorporation of plant defensins into the fungal cytoplasm was observed for nad <dig> , which was able to enter the f. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum hyphae but was not observed in the nuclei  <cit> . in contrast, lobo et al.  <cit>  showed that the defensin isolated from pisum sativum, psd <dig> could in fact have a nuclear target. this study and other related studies suggested that the antifungal activities of plant defensins are not restricted to the plasma membrane of fungi, as the defensins can enter the cells and target different intracellular compartments.

CONCLUSIONS
we cloned the pvd <dig> coding sequence into a pet- <dig> ek/lic vector, and this construct was used to transform the e. coli expression strain rosetta gami  <dig>  plyss. the expression and purification were successful. the presence of a soluble band above the  <dig>  kda marker was a good indication of the correct folding and formation of disulfide bounds in the recombinant protein. the biological functionality of pvd1r was confirmed by comparing its activity to the activity of pvd <dig> against wild-type c. albicans. both peptides presented very similar biological activity, with a growth inhibition of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. these results were corroborated by microscopic analysis of wild-type c. albicans treated with pvd1r and pvd <dig>  the cells treated with both peptides were agglomerated and reduced in number and also had smaller sized hyphae. to discover the target of the pvd1r in c. albicans, we used a mutant strain lacks the gene glucosylceramide synthase , which synthesizes the sphingolipid glucer. our results with this c. albicans mutant strain indicated that this strain is resistant to pvd <dig> and pvd1r compared with the wild-type strain. this conclusion was reached due to the absence of pvd <dig> and pvd1r activity in the growth inhibition assay, the observation that the morphology of the mutant strain was not affected and the finding that pvd1r did not enter the mutant strain cell. this final result not only demonstrates that pvd1r requires glucer at the membrane of c. albicans as a target to trigger it toxic effects but also that the defensin from p. vulgaris may have an intracellular target as well.
