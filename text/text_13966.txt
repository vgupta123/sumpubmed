BACKGROUND
cotyledon is the main nutrient storage area in soybean seed, which contains approximately 40% protein and 20% oil at maturity  <cit> . flowering plants are divided into monocots and dicots based on the number of cotyledons. in arabidopsis, as a paradigm for dicot embryonic development, cotyledons are specified from two lateral domains at the apical end of the embryo proper at the heart stage, showing bilateral symmetry  <cit> . several studies have reported cotyledon mutants in arabidopsis
, antirrhinum
 <cit> , tomato , and other plants  <cit> . these mutants have been used to identify a number of orthologous gene hierarchies that are involved in cotyledon development  <cit> . the arabidopsis cup-shaped cotyledon  genes , belonging to the plant-specific nac transcription factor, picea glauca nac <dig>  and shoot meristemless  are required for shoot apical meristem  formation and cotyledon separation . stm induces the expression of cuc genes, and the induction is specific and independent of other meristem regulators  <cit> . stm negatively regulates asymmetric leaves <dig> , and the mutation of as <dig> in arabidopsis disrupts cotyledon development  <cit> . knotted-like  is expressed at the boundary between the sam and cotyledon later than stm and cuc, suggesting that knat <dig> plays a crucial role in sam maintenance and boundary establishment in embryos via the stm/cuc pathway  <cit> .

phytohormones, primarily auxin, ck, br, ga, aba, and ja, orchestrate intrinsic developmental programs. previous studies have greatly advanced the functions of individual hormone. during last two decades, extensive lists of genes involved in hormone synthesis, catabolism and signal transduction have been identified via the analysis of mutants . auxin plays a key regulatory role in the initiation of cotyledon in the apical margin of the globular embryo  <cit> . in many plant species, including brassica napus
 <cit> , arabidopsis
 <cit> , and norway spruce
 <cit> , studies have shown that cotyledon and sam development could be inhibited by various polar auxin inhibitors in embryogenesis. pin auxin efflux regulators are the best characterised components of auxin transport. the polar location of pin <dig> is associated with the position of auxin accumulation in incipient cotyledons, and auxin flows into the primordium interior during cotyledon outgrowth  <cit> . the pin <dig> pid double mutant completely lacks cotyledons and bilateral symmetry and exhibits increased cuc <dig>  cuc <dig> and stm expression, indicating that directional auxin transport is important for the establishment of bilateral symmetry and the promotion of cotyledon outgrowth  <cit> . similarly, the pid enp double mutant, which is similar to “laterne”, also abolishes cotyledon development, reflecting failed auxin accumulation in the apex, and enp is necessary for cotyledon development via the control of pin <dig> polarity in the context of pid
 <cit> . in addition to auxin, some studies have shown that ck affects cotyledon development. exogenous application of benzyladenine  onto hybrid larch somatic embryos reduced the cotyledon number  <cit> . the amp-arabidopsis mutant demonstrated polycotyly, indicating an elevated cytokinin level  <cit> . arabidopsis esr <dig> and esr <dig>  whose expression levels are induced by cytokinin, not only control shoot regeneration but also play a role in cotyledon development  <cit> .

in this study, we characterised a soybean mutant named cco, which displayed curled cotyledons. the cco embryos at the torpedo stage resembled the “tail of swallow”. high performance liquid chromatography  analysis showed that cco seeds contained higher iaa and aba levels, but lower ga <dig> level. transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways were reprogrammed in cco.

RESULTS
embryogenesis in the ccomutant
we obtained the cco mutant following sodium azide  and 60coγ ray seed mutagenesis of soybean  <cit> , which was initially characterised by outward folding cotyledons . compared with wt, developing cotyledons of cco mutant had larger vacuoles and more membranous multilamellar structures, as well as higher methionine and cysteine content  <cit> . in addition, the germination rates of seeds were compared between the cco mutant and wt. in general, seeds from wt germinated on the second day, and the germination rate reached ~72% on the fifth day. cco seeds were dormant until the third day, and the germination rate was only ~ <dig> % on fifth day, suggesting that the germination rate of cco seeds was greatly reduced .figure  <dig>

to determine the embryogenesis defects in cco mutant, we traced its phenotype back to the globular stage of embryogenesis. in higher plants, embryogenesis can be conceptually divided into three overlapping phases: morphogenesis, maturation and desiccation  <cit> . in general, for the wild type at the globular stage, an embryo comprises a spherical embryo proper and a suspensor . the embryo proper is spherical during the pro-embryo and globular stage and eventually forms cotyledons, shoot meristem and hypocotyl region around the apical-basal axis, and this structure is connected to the embryo sac via the suspensor. during the globular-heart transition phase, a dramatic change occurs: two of the cotyledon primordia are symmetrically initiated from the lateral domains at the apical end of the heart-shaped embryo proper . subsequently, the cotyledons and hypocotyl elongate, and the embryo enters the torpedo stage in which the cotyledons continue to rotate. the morphogenesis phase of embryogenesis ends at the cotyledon stage .

however, the development of embryos in cco was slower than that in wt . when wt embryos were at the heart stage, cco embryos remained morphologically at the globular stage . the embryo proper in cco appeared smaller than that in wt . at the heart stage, cotyledons were initiated from the cotyledon primordia. figure 1e and 1i showed that the cotyledon initiation positions were identical in both the wt and cco. however, the wt cotyledons grew upwards, while that of the cco mutant demonstrated outward growth. subsequently, the bifurcation of the cotyledons at the torpedo stage in the cco mutant was larger, and the tips of the cotyledons were sharper . at the torpedo stage, cco mutant embryos resembled “tail of swallow”, while the radicle and shoot apical meristem were also present and appeared normal. all in all, cco showed abnormal embryogenesis, especially at the torpedo stage, when the cco cotyledons became more slender and grew outward. however, sam and the polar axis were normal. cotyledons and leaves share homology in plants  <cit> . cotyledon initiation and development in cco were defective, while leaf development was correct, suggesting partial homology between leaf and cotyledon.

increased free iaa and aba levels, while decreased ga3level in cco
the hormone auxin governs a variety of developmental processes  <cit> , including embryogenesis  <cit> . in embryogenesis, auxin controls cell division and specification, which are critical for establishing the embryo pattern. most of the pattern formation events in arabidopsis embryogenesis, including cotyledon development, depend on auxin biosynthesis, transport, and response  <cit> . iaa is the most important natural auxin. therefore, we examined the endogenous free iaa level in wt and the cco mutant seeds at  <dig> daf  by hplc analysis . compared with wt, the cco mutant had a higher free iaa level in seeds at  <dig> daf.figure  <dig>

**p <  <dig> .



in addition, the endogenous ga <dig> and aba content in wt and cco seeds at  <dig> daf were quantified. the measurements demonstrated that the aba content was significantly increased, while the ga <dig> content was decreased in cco . the increased aba/ga ratio may lead to a low germination rate for the cco mutant.

auxin sensitivity was depressed in cco
twelve auxin responsive genes, including two aux/iaa genes , five gh <dig> genes  and five saur genes , were selected to investigate the transcription of early auxin-regulated genes in response to auxin treatment by quantitative rt-pcr . as shown in figure  <dig>  all of these genes were up-regulated in wt at 30 min after treatment with  <dig>  μm  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . however, in the cco mutant, only three genes  were weakly up-regulated, and the other genes had weak variation or even unexpected down-regulation . when hypocotyls were treated with  <dig>  μm  <dig> -d, the twelve genes tested showed higher expression levels in wt, and glyma08g <dig> and glyma11g <dig> showed greater than five-fold up-regulation . with the exception of glyma12g <dig> and glyma05g <dig>  the expression trends of the genes in cco were similar to that observed after treatment with  <dig>  μm  <dig> -d . thus, auxin sensitivity were repressed in the cco mutant.figure  <dig>

rna-seq of wt and the ccomutant
the positions of the cotyledon primordia in cco were generally normal, but the abaxial/adaxial patterning of cotyledons was flawed, which was likely to exist before cotyledon initiation. thus, we focused on the globular stage, and the pods at  <dig> daf were collected for rna-seq using the illumina hiseq <dig> system. a total of  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> successful reads  were produced for wt and the cco mutant, respectively . notably, more than 85% of the reads mapped back to the soybean reference genome in phytozome database  <cit> . in wt,  <dig> % of these genes uniquely mapped to a single location, and  <dig> % uniquely mapped to a single location for cco . we identified  <dig>  highly confident genes in wt and  <dig>  genes in the cco mutant. with a false discovery rate  <  <dig>  and |log2ratio| ≥  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed;  <dig> degs had lower expression levels in the cco mutant, while  <dig> degs were activated . in this study, we primarily focused on the differentially expressed genes. the expression levels of the majority of these genes were unaffected in the cco mutant, suggesting that cco targeted a limited number of genes.table  <dig>

to validate the reliability of the expression profiles obtained using rna-seq, we selected fifteen genes with higher or lower expression levels for semi-quantitative reverse transcription pcr  analysis , and three  of the fifteen genes for further qrt-pcr analysis in 7daf pods from wt and the cco mutant . for all of the genes, the results obtained from the semi-quantitative rt-pcr/qrt-pcr analysis were consistent with data from rna-seq.table  <dig>

in addition, we used semi-quantitative rt-pcr to analyse the expression of four selected genes  in wt and cco seeds at  <dig> and  <dig> daf . using qrt-pcr, we examined the expression of three genes  in the roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds at the various developmental stages of wt and cco, and the results showed these genes were differentially expressed in these tissues , indicating some of the degs that we obtained were differentially expressed in other tissues.

functional classification of differentially expressed genes
to evaluate the potential functions of the degs between wt and the cco mutant, gene ontology  categories were used to identify key processes for cco mutant. detailed go term annotations of the degs were categorised according to biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. the go categories for the set of degs  revealed that most of the encoded products were associated with “intracellular organelle”, “catalytic activity”, “response to stimulus” and “cellular metabolic process”.figure  <dig> 
gene ontology classification of the differentially expressed genes between wt and
cco. differentially expressed genes are classified into three go categories: cellular component, molecular function and biological process.



biological interpretation of the  <dig> degs was further completed using kegg pathway analysis. many of the degs were mapped to pathways essential for plant growth and development. overall,  <dig> pathways were affected in the cco mutant, and some of these pathways were consistent with biological processes previously revealed in the go analysis. the most frequently represented pathways primarily involved in secondary metabolism, including plant hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction , such as auxin, ck, ga, aba, et, br and ja . asakura et al. found that genes expressed in the early pod stage of soybean were the most numerous, compared with  <dig> and 5 mm seeds, and the number of expressed genes gradually decreased with seed development  <cit> . commonly expressed genes in these stages accounted for 70–95% of the expressed genes in each stage, and only a small number of genes were differentially expressed, which mainly included β-conglycinin, lipid synthesis, lipoxygenase and seed-maturation proteins  <cit> . therefore, most degs obtained in this study, including genes that were related to hormone biosynthesis and signalling, could still be identified in the early seed stage. however, some degs may have been missed because of tissue-dependent gene expression.

the results of the transcriptome data showed that many genes encoding proteins involved in auxin metabolism and signal transduction pathways were differentially expressed between cco and wt. l-tryptophan, as a primary precursor, is used to generate many indole-containing substances in plants, including iaa. α-subunit anthranilate synthase  catalyses the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate as one of the first steps in the trp biosynthesis pathway. in arabidopsis, up-regulation of weak ethylene insensitive2/anthranilate synthase α <dig>  gene through et results in auxin accumulation in the tips of primary roots  <cit> . transgenic rice lines expressing α-subunit of anthranilate synthase  gene show increased production of tryptophan and free iaa  <cit> . tryptophan synthase beta subunit  catalyses the last step in tryptophan biosynthesis. in iaa biosynthesis, indole-3-acetaldoximem -dependent iaa biosynthesis is a specific pathway in plants. in this process, two homologous cytochrome p <dig> enzymes, cyp79b <dig> and cyp79b <dig>  mediate the synthesis of iaox from tryptophan  <cit> , and the double mutation of these two genes results in the downregulation of iaa synthesis. in the transcriptome data obtained in this study, one asa gene, one tbs gene and three cyp <dig> genes were up-regulated, suggesting that auxin synthesis was enhanced in the cco mutant . mounting evidence suggests that polar auxin transport  controls important growth and developmental processes in higher plants. in arabidopsis, studies have shown that the auxin1/like-aux <dig>  family of auxin transporters are major influx carriers, whereas the pin-formed  family of auxin proteins are major efflux carriers. the aux/lax family is represented by four highly conserved genes, namely aux <dig>  lax <dig>  lax <dig>  and lax <dig>  lax <dig> regulates vascular patterning in cotyledons. transcriptome data showed that three lax <dig> genes and one pin gene were up-regulated in the cco mutant, indicating that auxin polar transport was also influenced. auxin-responsive genes include gh <dig> genes, small auxin up rna  genes and aux/iaa genes  <cit> . in our transcriptome data, one aux/iaa and five saur genes were down-regulated, and four saur genes were up-regulated in cco . all of the gh <dig> genes were up-regulated, which were likely due to the down-regulation of the aux/iaa genes as aux/laa proteins repress the expression of gh <dig> genes in soybean  <cit> . taken together, these data indicated that auxin biosynthesis and signal transduction in cco were more active than in wt.figure  <dig>

the role of ga in embryo morphogenesis has not yet been determined. in general, ga is required for seed development, which is determined through the analysis of ga-deficient mutants. in pea , the ga-biosynthesis mutant lh has provided the best evidence for the physiological role of ga in seed development. the lh protein, which encodes ent-kaurene oxidase , is required for the three-step oxidation of ent-kaurene to ent-kaurenoic acid as an early step in the ga biosynthesis pathway altering seed development  <cit> . ks  and ko are key enzymes in the ga biosynthetic pathway, and both are encoded by a single gene in soybean. ga2ox  plays an important role in the last step of ga biosynthesis and catalyses the inactivation of gas by conversion to bioactive gas, thereby affecting the amount of bioactive gas. overexpression of ga2ox genes results in reduced ga level in arabidopsis
 <cit> , rice  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> . della-domain proteins are transcriptional regulators that repress ga responses, and these proteins are rapidly degraded in response to ga. in this study, one ko gene and one ks gene were downregulated in the cco mutant, suggesting that an early step in ga biosynthesis was blocked . in addition, four ga2ox genes and three della genes were up-regulated, suggesting that the rate of conversion of inactive gas to bioactive gas was limited for the cco mutant .

aba not only plays an important role in the stress responses and plant tolerance, but also controls seed development and germination. the enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  is involved in a rate-limiting step for aba biosynthesis. recently, martínez-andújar et al. reported that the nced <dig> induction enhanced seed dormancy in arabidopsis
 <cit> . here, we showed that nced genes were up-regulated in the cco mutant, suggesting that aba synthesis was promoted. however, another gene encoding abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase, which catalyses a key step in aba catabolism, was also up-regulated . snf1-related protein kinases  are key positive regulators in aba signal transduction pathway. in the absence of aba, protein phosphatases type 2c  physically interact with snrk2s and negatively regulate aba responses. however, interactions between pp2cs and snrk2s are disrupted when an aba molecule binds to pyrabactin resistance <dig> /pyr1-like /regulatory components of aba receptors  receptors, leading to structural changes in these receptors. when snrk2s are released from pp2c inhibition, their downstream targets, including aba-responsive element binding factors , are activated  <cit> . fujii et al. constructed an arabidopsis line carrying mutations in all  <dig> members of the snrk <dig> family. the decuple mutant snrk <dig> /2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/ <dig>  was defective in gene regulation and aba accumulation  <cit> . in our data, the pp2cs, snrk <dig> and abf genes were up-regulated in the cco mutant . in summary, aba biosynthesis, catabolism and signalling were enhanced in cco.

in addition to auxin, ga and aba, the pathways of other hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction  were also influenced in the cco mutant. ck and et, as major classes of plant hormone, are involved in various aspects of plant development, including organ development  <cit> . in cco, we found two genes encoding adenosine-phosphate isopentenyltransferase , a rate-limiting enzyme in ck biosynthesis, expressed at significantly higher levels  <cit>  . in ck signalling, type-b arabidopsis response regulators  are transcriptional activators that regulate cytokinin targets, including type-a arrs  <cit> . we observed the up-regulation of two type-b arr genes . aminocyclopropane-carboxylate oxidase , an “ethylene-forming enzyme” , catalyses the final step in ethylene biosynthesis, converting l-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  into ethylene, co <dig>  and cyanide. four aco genes were up-regulated in cco . antisense constructs of aco genes can notably reduce et production  <cit> . et signalling was also influenced in the cco mutant, and the expression levels of ethylene-related genes encoding serine/threonine-protein kinase , mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig> , and ethylene-responsive transcription factor  were altered in cco . brs regulate embryonic and post-embryonic development, adult homeostasis and expression of numerous genes  <cit> . plant steroid hormones are recognised by brassinosteroid-insensitive  <dig> , whose kinase activity is activated by exogenous br application  <cit> . we also found that the expression levels of thirteen br <dig> and four bri <dig> associated receptor kinase  <dig>  genes in cco were higher than those in wt . ja regulates plant growth and stress responses, biosynthetic pathway of which starts with α-linolenic acid  <cit> . the degs in ja biosynthesis and signalling pathway included those that encode phospholipase a <dig>  12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase, lipoxygenase, jasmonate-zim  and myc <dig> proteins  <cit>  .

auxin, br, ck and ga are generally considered major developmental growth regulators, whereas aba, et and ja are involved in stress responses, all of these hormones converge on auxin  <cit> . auxin is not only a hormone but also a morphogen. auxin accumulation is controlled by auxin biosynthesis and metabolism, the conjugation/deconjugation of active auxin to/from its inactive conjugated form and auxin transport . auxin maxima and activity have been implicated in embryo development and patterning  <cit> . in cco, the free iaa level and auxin polar transport were affected. polar auxin transport promotes the formation of local auxin maxima and gradients within tissues that play important roles in auxin action, such as the patterns of cell division and differentiation in the root meristem  <cit>  and the establishment of cotyledons  <cit> . plants show directional growth in response to environmental stimuli such as light or gravity . it was found that auxin played an important role in tropisms  <cit>  and unequal auxin distribution across organs may lead their bending  <cit> . the cotyledons of cco showed outward bending, which allowed us to hypothesise that pat might cause an auxin imbalance between the abaxial and adaxial side in cotyledons of the cco mutant, resulting in the adaxial side developing faster than the abaxial side. however, in soybean embryogenesis, the endosperm surrounds the embryo and cotyledons, the curled cotyledons observed in the cco mutant might reflect the fetter of the endosperm. many signals can regulate auxin polar transport including stress, protein phosphorylation, reactive oxygen, flavonols and other hormones , which among these signals affect pat in cco require further investigation. in cco, only the shape of cotyledons not including leaves was abnormal, indicating that signal or mutated genes regulating pat were specific for cotyledon initiation and growth.

ga and aba have mainly been implicated in later stages of embryo development, acting antagonistically in the regulation of seed germination  <cit> . compared with wt, cco showed higher iaa and aba levels, whereas a lower ga <dig> level. several reports indicate that auxin and ga overlap in the regulation of multiple aspects of plant development, and there is positive cross-talk interaction between them. willige et al. have reported that a mutant deficient in ga biosynthesis and signalling showed a reduced pin protein level, which could be recovered by exogenous ga application. moreover, ga could interact with pin <dig> and promote cotyledon differentiation  <cit> . auxin can also induce ga biosynthesis. root cells with lower auxin level have reduced ga biosynthesis  <cit> . interestingly, our results demonstrated a lower ga <dig> but higher iaa level in cco seeds. but beyond that, cco seeds had higher aba content, which might correlate with lower ga <dig> level and may be the reason for lower germination rate in cco. consistently, aba negatively regulates bioactive ga level during seed germination.

CONCLUSIONS
multiple phytohormone biosynthesis and signalling pathways are reprogrammed in the cco mutant, which is consistent with our hplc analysis. our results indicate that curled-cotyledons and reduced seed germination rate may result from the biosynthesis and signalling disorder of multiple phytohormones. accumulating evidence supports the idea that hormones not only act in a linear pathway but also function in a complex network of feedback regulation and cross talk within or between different hormone pathways. at present, the studies of molecular mechanisms underlying hormonal cross talk mainly focus on postembryonic development, including the roots, shoots and leaves. however, adequate models of the hormonal network involved in cotyledon development are not well established in plants. analysis of cco may provide a promising frame for further studies of hormone interactions and offer the potential discovery of new genes controlling cotyledon development in plants.
