BACKGROUND
over the past 10 years, extensive studies on the functional organization of the nuclear space in mammalian cells have shown that the architecture of the interphase nucleus is clearly non-random and compartmentalized. furthermore, this high-level organization involving chromosomes, subnuclear compartments or the nuclear envelope appears to be important in regulating gene expression . one feature of this landscape involves the dynamic, transient interactions that occur between different nuclear components and that regulate gene expression and silencing. most genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii , and several studies have suggested that it participates in transcription factories that regulate transcription at particularly high rates . several studies have reported that transcriptionally active genes, often found at the periphery of their chromosome territories , can interact in cis or in trans in these pol ii-enriched compartments via chromatin loops . these loops enable distal genes to engage in chromosomal contacts, which are strongly correlated with their transcriptional activity. some of these interactions may allow contacts between “enhancers” and “promoters”  <cit> , and may also facilitate the transcription of coregulated genes in multigene complexes  <cit> .

progress in imaging and molecular techniques help detect these interactions; these technical advances include fluorescence in situ hybridization  and molecular approaches such as the chromatin proximity-ligation assay called chromosome conformation capture   <cit>  and its derivatives, including hi-c, that scan the whole genome for sequences found close together in nuclei  <cit> . another genome-wide assay, the chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end-tag sequencing , can detect long-range chromatin interactions associated with pol ii  <cit> . however, the in-depth analyses of these global interactome datasets generated from a given cell population have revealed large heterogeneity due to cell-to-cell variability, pinpointing the need to combine these approaches with analyses at the cellular level  <cit> .

in the case of imprinted genes, often found in clusters  <cit> , long-range intra- and interchromosomal interactions have been found and have been linked to the parental origin of regulatory sequences, supporting the existence of long-distance regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . one conserved imprinted region containing insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , an important gene coding for one of the major growth factors  <cit> , and h <dig> has been particularly studied. these genes, located approximatively 100 kb apart on mouse chromosome  <dig>  are separated by an imprinting control region . this icr regulates igf2/h <dig> expression such that igf <dig> is transcribed only from the methylated paternal chromosome and h <dig> only from the unmethylated maternal chromosome  <cit> . these differentially methylated regions interact in cis and these interactions partition maternal and paternal chromatin into distinct loops leading to different specific patterns of 3d organization for each allele  <cit> . several studies on different cell types have also revealed trans-interactions between the h <dig> locus and other genes located on different chromosomes  <cit> , with imprinted genes being overrepresented in these interchromosomal interactions. however, the epigenetic status of the h <dig> icr seems to determine the patterns of most interchromosomal interactions. thus in neonatal liver, various approaches  on specific mouse crosses have confirmed that the absence of ccctc-binding factor   abrogates the interchromosomal association between igf2/h <dig> and other regions on mouse chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, dna interactions between h <dig> icr and delta-like homolog  <dig>  preferentially involve the expressed maternal h <dig> allele whereas the paternal allele expressing igf <dig> participates in only a low percentage of nuclei  <cit> . igf <dig> involved in myogenesis, has a major effect on muscle mass in livestock, underlining its importance for pig breeding research. a paternally expressed quantitative trait locus  affecting muscle growth, fat deposition and heart size has been mapped to the igf <dig> region on porcine chromosome  <dig>  . given the important role of igf <dig>  we focused our interest on this paternally expressed locus to test whether it is also involved in trans-associations in fetal pig liver and muscle cells. we first verified the imprinted status of igf2/h <dig> in porcine fetal cells using rna fish. igf <dig> belongs to an imprinted gene network  of coregulated genes predominantly expressed in somatic stem cells  <cit> ; we therefore selected five genes from this network: slc38a <dig>  dlk <dig>  meg <dig>  rpl <dig>  zac <dig> and gpc <dig> located on chromosome x to screen for potential patterns of interactions with igf <dig>  we also analyzed nf <dig>  osbp <dig>  osbpl <dig> and abcg <dig> because 3c/4c assays and 3d fish analyses show that they interact with the igf2/h <dig> domain in mouse neonatal liver cells  <cit>  and finally sep <dig>  zar <dig> as controls. preliminary screening done using dna fish on porcine fetal liver cells showed that the two neighboring reciprocally imprinted genes, dlk <dig> and maternally expressed gene  <dig>  had the highest rate of colocalization with igf <dig>  to further analyze this colocalization, we used 3d fish experiments, combined with rna-dna fish experiments and confocal microscopy analyses, to determine which alleles are involved in this association.

in addition, because the monoallelic expression of igf <dig> provides an interesting model system to probe the relationship between gene expression and nuclear position, we analyzed the position of the two alleles  relative to their cts to shed light on the relationship between nuclear architecture and transcription control.

methods
preparation of complex dna probes
probes for dna fish
bacterial artificial clones  containing genes were isolated from a porcine bac library  using specific primers designed with primer <dig> software  . approximately 50 ng of bac dna was random-priming labeled by incorporation of dutp alexa fluor using the bioprime dna labeling kit . for multiple-label experiments, we labeled dna fish probes directly with alexa fluor  <dig> or  <dig>  or, if necessary, with biotin-16-dutp detected by immuno-fish. porcine chromosome paint probes  and  <dig> ) from flow-sorted chromosomes  <cit>  were individually directly labeled by random priming with alexa fluor  <dig> .

probes for rna fish
igf <dig> genomic dna probe encompassing igf <dig> exons  <dig> to  <dig>  was generated by pcr to detect nascent rna. h <dig> rna fish was performed using two genomic dna fragments encompassing h <dig> exon  <dig> and exons  <dig> to  <dig> . for dlk <dig> rna detection, a pool of several pcr fragments from genomic dna amplification including exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  was used. similarly, two genomic dna fragments encompassing meg <dig> exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were used to detect meg <dig> rna. labeling was performed by random priming with incorporation of dutp alexa fluor for single rna fish or with biotin revealed after hybridization by using the tyramide signal amplification kit  for combined rna/dna fish experiments.

products from the labeling reactions  were subsequently filtered through microspin g- <dig> columns and ethanol precipitated with porcine cot- <dig> dna  and salmon sperm dna . each probe was deposited on slides at a final concentration of 90 ng/μl in hybridization buffer .

preparation of cells and slides
liver cells were prepared from fetal european large white pig . all reagents were rnase-free and all steps performed at 4 °c to preserve rna. after a brief fixation of 30 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde according to the size of the excised tissue , rinsed fresh liver tissues were partially disrupted to make a cell suspension in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline  containing 5 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex . cells resuspended in 1× dmem medium containing 20 % glycerol were stored at −80 °c. before in situ hybridization experiments, stored cells were thawed slowly then rinsed many times in cold 1× pbs before permeabilization for 3 min with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> in cytoskeleton extraction buffer csk . after washes in 1× pbs, cells were postfixed for 2 min in cold 4 % paraformaldehyde. about 15 μl of a dense cell suspension obtained after centrifugation at 300 × g for 3 min were applied to superfrost glass slides  to obtain cell adhesion just before hybridization experiments. to preserve 3d cell structures, preparations were not dehydrated with an ethanol series, but were just deposited on the slide and left to air-dry for a few minutes.

for the preparation of muscle samples, tissues were dissected to obtain a fiber pack and successive treatments as described above were carried out in small petri dishes.

in situ hybridization experiments
2d dna fish
the chromosomal localizations and specificity of all probes used  were controlled by 2d dna fish on porcine metaphases prepared from lymphocytes according to standard protocols  <cit> . igf <dig> is localized on ssc2p <dig> and  on ssc7q <dig> .

3d dna-fish experiments on interphase nuclei

in situ hybridization experiments were carried out immediately after cell preparation on slides. after probe solution was applied to the cell preparation and the coverslip sealed with rubber cement, cells and probes were simultaneously heat-denatured at 75 °c for 8 min and then incubated overnight at 37 °c in a wet chamber in a dako hybridizer. after removing the coverslips, post-hybridization washes were performed with gentle agitation first in 2× ssc at room temperature  for 3 min, then twice for 3 min in 2× ssc, 50 % formamide ph  <dig>  at 40 °c and finally, twice for 15 min in 2× ssc then in pbs at room temperature. when a biotin-labeled probe was used, the slides were blocked with  <dig>  % pbs/bsa at room temperature before biotins were detected by incubating the slides with streptavidin-alexa  <dig> for 1 h at room temperature. the slides were washed in pbs/tween- <dig>  for 2 × 10 min and pbs 3 × 15 min at 37 °c. nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′diamidino-2- phenylindole  in vectashield medium .

3d rna-dna fish
rna and dna fish were performed sequentially on the same nuclei and visualized in  <dig> or  <dig> different colors. probes for rna fish were denatured for 6 min at 90 °c and immediately put on ice. after 10 min, rnasin was added to the probes before depositing on slides. non-denatured cells were then hybridized overnight in a humidified environment at 37 °c in a hybridizer. post-hybridization washes were performed in 2 × ssc at room temperature  for 15 min. to increase the sensitivity and enhance the stability of the rna signal during the subsequent dna fish, a tyramide-alexa  <dig> signal amplification kit  was used. briefly hybridized biotinylated dna probes are saturated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase . in the presence of small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, streptavidin-hrp converts a labeled tyramide into an extremely reactive intermediate resulting in minimal diffusion-related loss of signal localization. the tsa kit was used following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. before hybridization, some slides were treated with 200 μg/ml rnase for 1 h at 37 °c as negative controls. just before the subsequent dna fish experiment , cells were slightly permeabilized again with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> in csk for 3 min maximum to favor access of alexa 633-streptavidin to the nuclear space and were then washed in pbs .

when four-color rna-dna fish was performed, we labeled the probes as follows: the rna signals were detected using biotinylated probes revealed by alexa 488-tsa kit, porcine chromosome painting probes were preferentially directly labeled by random priming with alexa  <dig>  and other dna probes by indirect labeling with biotin-streptavidin conjugated with alexa  <dig>  sequential rna and dna fish allowed us to use two biotinylated probes without detection problem. during the first step , the tsa system totally saturates the biotinylated probe and stabilizes the signals during the revelation process, thereby allowing immediate reuse of the cells for dna fish with another biotinylated probe.

first screening of dna interactions
the 3d dna fish protocol was used but the analysis was done on a zeiss axiophot epifluorescence microscope coupled to a cytovision workstation . loci were considered as associated when signals were observed in close proximity  and/or colocalized. no distance measurement was obtained in this case.

confocal microscopy and image analyses
image stacks were collected using a leica tcssp <dig> confocal microscope  equipped with an oil immersion objective . the z-stacks  were acquired at 1024 × 1024 pixels per frame using an 8-bit pixel depth for each channel at a constant voxel size of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  μm.

segmentations and 3d measurements between objects  were done using nemo  <cit>  as described previously  <cit> , an imagej plug-in designed to interactively analyze fish 3d images and automatically measure object distances in multiple-channel experiments. the program distributed under the creative commons license can be freely downloaded from https://forge-dga.jouy.inra.fr/projects/nemo. we carried out our analyses on about  <dig> confocal planes in semi-automatic detection mode to minimize image signal-to-noise ratio and keep only the informative signals inside the nucleus for further processing. after having determined the processing parameters that define xyz resolutions and filters to run on raw images , all objects within a nucleus were detected automatically based on the intensity of pixels above a globally set threshold. the criteria for segmented object validation  and number) were defined once for each type of object and applied to all nuclei. the resulting segmentation for each cell was validated by manual comparison with the raw image. nemo can compute the percentage of colocalization and various distances between objects : center-to-center distances, center-to-border or border-to-border distances between objects. the distances computed were euclidean distances taking into account the x, y and z resolutions. given the resolution on the z axis, at least three pixels corresponding to  <dig>  μm  were required for a high resolution between two separate signals; consequently 1 μm was chosen as the upper cut-off for associated signals.

spatial positioning of igf <dig> rna or dna relative to chromosome territories
for each cell, we measured the distances between rna or dna spot centers and ct edge and the percentage of colocalization in the cts. to determine the position of the signals  relative to their ct, we defined three categories  as described previously  <cit> , taking into account the allele center-to-ct edge distances and the percentage of gene colocalization in ct. the edge category comprises genes located at less than one voxel from the edge of the segmented ct. a χ
 <dig> test was used to compare the signal distribution in these categories. p values <  <dig>  were considered as significant.

gene-gene or rna-gene associations
the 3d distances  between loci or loci-rna were measured to determine if associations occur between them. a distance of 1 μm was chosen as upper cut-off for association. signals were classified into two different categories: 1) associated, when the two loci were found separated by a distance d ≤ 1 μm that generally corresponded to partially colocalized loci; 2) distant, when d > 1 μm.

igf <dig> and h <dig> imprinting status in fetal liver cells
we set up rna fish experiments on non-denatured porcine fetal liver cells using an igf <dig> probe to verify its imprinted status. we first verified that the signals detected corresponded to rna spots . the biallelic expression of β actin was used as a positive control . igf <dig> imprinting status was analyzed in  <dig> pigs . igf <dig> expression was detected in 64 % of the liver cells investigated, and observed as a single spot in the vast majority  of these labeled nuclei, thereby confirming its monoallelic expression status . the parental origin of the transcripts cannot be determined in rna fish experiments. however, exclusive paternal igf <dig> expression in porcine fetal liver cells has been demonstrated previously  <cit> . we also verified the monoallelic expression of h <dig>  in fetal liver cells. the majority of cells displayed a monoallelic transcription pattern . both h <dig> and igf <dig> rnas can be detected in the same nucleus as illustrated in fig. 1b.fig.  <dig> rna and successive dna fish of imprinted igf <dig> locus in porcine fetal liver cells. nuclei are counterstained with 4′,6′ diamidino-2-phenylindole . a, igf <dig> rna fish: monoallelic expression of igf <dig>  is detected when non-denatured nuclei are hybridized with a direct alexa <dig> labeled igf <dig> probe. the monoallelic pattern was detected in six nuclei. bar = 5 μm; b, igf <dig> and h <dig> rna fish: monoallelic expression of igf <dig>  and h <dig> . igf <dig> and h <dig> rnas were distant from each other, corresponding to the transcripts of single expressed allele from opposite chromosome 2; c, igf <dig> rna fish: igf <dig> rna signal was enhanced and stabilized by the use of tsa kit ; d, sequential igf <dig> rna-dna fish: igf <dig> rna was labeled with a biotin-tsa-alexa <dig> probe  and igf <dig> dna with a direct alexa568-labeled bac probe . the rna signal tags the expressed allele. bar = 2 μm




igf <dig> positioning relative to ssc <dig> chromosome territories
to determine the position of nascent rna relative to the edge of ssc <dig> ct, transcription sites relative to the ssc <dig> ct were analyzed by using sequential rna-dna fish. the rna signals were amplified and stabilized using a tsa kit . according to the criteria presented in methods, nascent igf <dig> rnas were preferentially located outside their cts in 72 % of the  <dig> nuclei analyzed . the maximal distance found between the center of an rna signal and the ct edge reached  <dig>  μm.fig.  <dig> analysis of nuclear positioning of igf <dig> transcripts relative to the proximal chromosome territory  in interphase nuclei of porcine liver cells by 3d fish and confocal microscopy. a, two images of 3d rna-dna fish revealing igf <dig> rna signals  and ssc <dig> : . nuclei were counterstained with dapi; b, the distribution of igf <dig> rna towards the chromosome territory  was scored in one of three classes: inside, edge and outside. the three classes were defined by combining the 3d distances  obtained with nemo  <cit> . a significant fraction of rna signals was found located outside ssc <dig> 




the monoallelic expression of igf <dig> made it possible to probe the relationship between gene activity and nuclear positioning by comparing, in a single cell nucleus, the position of the active and inactive alleles relative to cts. we developed a four-color 3d rna-dna fish method to detect simultaneously the nascent igf <dig> rna molecules, the two igf <dig> dna loci, the cts and the nucleus. because this type of four-color 3d experiment is difficult to implement, we proceeded by steps. we first combined dna and rna fish experiments to visualize the two dna alleles simultaneously as well as the transcription sites labeling the active allele. we observed only one igf <dig> rna signal  close to one of the two dna loci . we then added the chromosome painting probe to label the chromosome  <dig> territories . we assigned each allele to its ct by identifying the nearest signal in  <dig> nuclei. the distance between the center of the dna signal and the ct edge and the percentage of allele colocalization in the ct were determined for each allele. three categories  were defined to classify the allele position relative to the ct. two groups  were assessed. there was no specific preferential localization for the alleles according to their expression status , although expressed alleles showed a slight tendency to be located outside their ct . the measurements of 3d  distances for both alleles ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  μm and confirmed the tendency of the expressed allele to be more frequently outside the ct . we then analyzed the data nucleus by nucleus to study pairs of alleles. however, the total number of nuclei  was insufficient to obtain a robust conclusion considering the nine allele position combinations .fig.  <dig> position of expressed and non-expressed igf <dig> alleles, relative to chromosome territories . a, extended focus of image sections from confocal microscopy created using volocity software illustrating three scenarios  of igf <dig> allele position towards ssc2: , ii  and iii ). igf <dig> gene transcription sites were detected by 3d rna fish, igf <dig> dna alleles and ssc <dig> by 3d dna fish. column  <dig> shows the igf <dig> rna  and ssc <dig> , column  <dig> igf <dig> dna  and ssc <dig> , column  <dig> the merge. the nuclei were counterstained with dapi , the green fluorescence outside the nucleus is due to autofluorescence. white arrows on merge images indicate the position of the expressed alleles based on rna fish signals; b, histogram representing the percentage of nuclei of the two groups of igf <dig> alleles  relative to ssc <dig>  in  <dig> nuclei




screening for genes that potentially associate with igf2
in mammal model species, the clustering of imprinted genes is linked to common and long-distance regulatory mechanisms, including trans-interactions that contribute to the regulation of gene expression. our aim was to determine if igf <dig> associates with other genes in porcine fetal tissues. we selected genes, some imprinted  and/or also highly expressed in fetal liver cells : slc38a <dig> , dlk <dig> , meg <dig> , rpl <dig> , zac <dig> , gpc <dig> , nf <dig>  osbp <dig>  osbpl <dig> and abcg <dig>  the latter four genes interact with the igf2/h <dig> domain in mouse neonatal liver cells  <cit> , but information on their expression level in porcine fetal liver is known only for osbpl <dig> and abcg <dig> . we carried out a preliminary screening as described in methods. the results of association between igf <dig> and these genes are given in table  <dig> table  <dig> detected gene associations upon preliminary screening on liver cells

the percentages of association ranged from  <dig> to 37 %, and were relatively high  for seven of the nine investigated genes, suggesting that igf <dig> associates with some of these genes. it includes the four genes previously described to interact with the igf2/h <dig> domain in mouse neonatal liver cells. the highest values of association frequency  were observed between igf <dig> and  and between igf <dig> and nf <dig>  of these associations, we focused on the association between the imprinted igf <dig> and dlk1-meg <dig>  genes to validate and further investigate it using a 3d analysis.

3d analysis of trans-association between igf <dig> and 
determination of non-associating control
relying on the fact that transcribed genes tend to interact preferentially, we selected two genes zar <dig>  and sep <dig>  expressed at a very low level in liver and muscle cells  as negative controls. we first verified that these genes were associated only in a low percentage of cells. zar <dig> associated with sep <dig> in only 7 % of the cells analyzed , and never at a distance <1 μm. second, we tested the non-association between igf <dig>  and zar <dig> . igf <dig> was found associated with zar <dig> in 8 % of the cells analyzed .

the expressed igf <dig> allele associates in trans with  in liver cells
we first confirmed the association between igf <dig> and  loci by performing 3d dna fish . dlk <dig> and meg <dig>  located in the same bac clone due to their close proximity, were visualized as one signal. an association between igf <dig> and  regions was detected in 19 % of the nuclei investigated . only one igf <dig> allele was associated with one  allele. given that the dlk1-meg <dig> and igf <dig> loci map to different porcine chromosomes , this interchromosomal association suggests a spatial proximity of ssc <dig> and ssc <dig>  these cts were found in close proximity  in 60 % of the nuclei analyzed . among them, each ssc <dig> chromosome was found close to a ssc <dig> in  <dig>  % of the nuclei and only one ssc <dig> was found close to a ssc <dig> in  <dig>  % of the nuclei. an illustration of the co-hybridization of chromosome paints  and gene clusters  in a multi-color 3d dna fish experiment is shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> analysis of the association between igf <dig> and  in liver cells. decomposed confocal images  were processed using volocity software. the nucleus was counterstained with dapi . a, 3d dna fish: igf <dig> – . i: igf <dig> alleles , ii:  alleles , each green spot corresponds to both merged alleles of dlk <dig> and meg <dig> genes, iii: merge, white arrows point to associated signals. on the right ; b, 3d rna-dna fish: igf <dig> rna –  dna. i: igf <dig> rna , ii:  alleles , iii: merge, white arrows point associated signals. on the left : histogram presenting the percentage of nuclei with rna-dna association was shown




to determine if one particular igf <dig> allele is involved, we tagged the expressed allele by labeling the nascent igf <dig> rna in a three-color 3d rna-dna fish experiment allowing the simultaneous visualization of igf <dig> rna signals and dlk <dig> dna spots . signals were found associated in  <dig> out of  <dig> nuclei analyzed corresponding to 21 % of nuclei. the results of the frequencies of trans-associations in pig fetal cells are reported in table  <dig>  percentages of cells showing association between igf <dig> and dlk <dig>  both in dna-dna and rna-dna experiments were concordant . the last experiment highlighted that this association involved the expressed igf <dig> allele but, due to the low expression level of dlk <dig> in fetal liver cells, it was not possible to determine by rna fish if the association involves the expressed allele of dlk <dig>  of meg <dig> or both. as igf2/h <dig>  dlk <dig> and meg <dig> reciprocal imprinted genes have been shown to be highly expressed in porcine fetal muscle , we completed the analysis in this tissue.table  <dig> percentage of cells showing trans-associations in pig fetal liver and muscle cells




deciphering the association between the expressed igf <dig> allele and the dlk1/meg <dig> alleles in muscle cells
we first verified that the dna-dna association found between igf <dig> and dlk1-meg <dig> loci in liver cells was also conserved in fetal muscle cells. this association was detected in 36 % of the nuclei investigated . in the great majority of cells in which this association was observed , it involved only one allele of each locus . other patterns  were underrepresented . in addition, the two alleles of the  locus were associated in 10 % of nuclei.fig.  <dig> analysis of the association between igf <dig> and  in muscle cells. decomposed confocal images and merge images are shown. the nucleus is counterstained with dapi . bar = 3 μm. a, 3d dna fish showing dna hybridization signals. i: igf <dig> dna , ii:   dna and iii: merge. only one allele of igf <dig> was associated with one allele of  region; b, 3d rna fish. i: meg <dig> rna , ii: igf <dig> rna  and iii: dlk <dig> rna . the three igf <dig> , dlk <dig> , meg <dig>  rnas were shown partially colocalized




we then carried out dlk <dig> and meg <dig> rna fish experiments in muscle. the transcription of these genes was observed in approximately 50 % of the cells analyzed . by using rna combined with dna fish, we confirmed the monoallelic expression status of igf <dig>  dlk <dig> and meg <dig> in  <dig>   <dig> and 89 % of muscle cell nuclei respectively, all detected close to their dna loci. to determine if the expressed alleles of these three different imprinted genes associate, we performed 3d rna fish experiments. igf <dig> and dlk <dig> rna signals were associated in 32 % of the nuclei analyzed , igf <dig> and meg <dig> rnas in 40 %, including a high percentage of colocalized signals   demonstrating that the expressed igf <dig> allele associated with both expressed dlk <dig> and meg <dig> alleles . meg <dig> and dlk <dig> rna transcripts were also associated in 25 % of the nuclei analyzed , confirming the association observed in the dna fish experiment. a multiple labeling experiment was carried out to analyze the three rnas simultaneously. the three rna signals were found associated in  <dig>  % of the nuclei  . a double rna association was detected in 40 % of the nuclei for igf2/meg <dig> , 25 % of the nuclei for dlk1/meg <dig>  and 32 % of the nuclei for igf2/dlk <dig>  .

migration of h <dig> nuclear rna in muscle cells
our aim was to label the maternal igf <dig> allele to determine if the non-expressed allele is also implicated in associations with other loci. one possible way to label the non-expressed igf <dig> allele is to target the reciprocally imprinted h <dig> allele. we carried out a 3d rna-dna fish experiment with different probes labeling h <dig> rna and h <dig> dna loci. the analysis was more complex than expected . although 83 % of the nuclei analyzed  showed a single h <dig> rna spot , this spot was found in proximity to the corresponding dna locus  in only 22 % of the cells. in most of the cases , it was located far away, suggesting that it had migrated in the nuclear space  . in addition, at least two spots were detected in the remaining 17 % of the nuclei analyzed. in this case, two patterns were observed: 1) two rna spots  were detected close to the two dna loci ; 2) more than two spots were observed including at least one spot distant from the dna locus  . remarkably, 72 % of all the nuclei analyzed showed an rna spot distant from the dna locus, suggesting a migration phenomenon. we also observed a beads-on-a-string pattern of h <dig> rna signals between the two h <dig> alleles . consequently, we were not able to use h <dig> rna signals to label the igf <dig> maternal allele.fig.  <dig> analysis of h <dig> hybridization patterns  in muscle cells. 3d rna-dna fish: h <dig> rna spot was labeled in green and h <dig> dna loci in red, nucleus is counterstained with dapi. bar = 1 μm. a, h <dig> rna spot near one h <dig> dna locus; b, one h <dig> rna spot distant to the two dna loci; c, two h <dig> rna spots located at dna loci and an additional migrating h <dig> rna signal; d, h <dig> rna signals as a beads-on-string pattern migrating from one h <dig> allele to the other




discussion
detection and position of igf <dig> and h <dig> rnas in porcine fetal tissues
the imprinting of the tandem igf2-h <dig> locus is required for their balanced expression and normal development  <cit> . paternally expressed igf <dig> acts as a growth factor and maternally expressed h <dig> non-coding rna regulates the transcription of growth-enhancing  and growth-inhibiting imprinted genes during gestation. regulation of genomic imprinting at this locus is well established and is expected to be conserved among species. in pig, the igf2-h <dig> imprinting cluster is quite similar to the corresponding well-studied human cluster  <cit> . it also exhibits several striking features, including a very high gc content  and an exceptional concentration of cpg islands often associated with icr. paternal imprinting status of igf <dig> has previously been studied in porcine liver and muscle  <cit>  and h <dig> has been shown to be exclusively expressed from the maternal allele in all major organs  <cit> . the paternal expression of dlk <dig> and the maternal expression of meg <dig> in muscle tissue have been also confirmed in pig  <cit> . our rna fish results are in agreement with these data: the majority of fetal liver and muscle cells displayed monoallelic expression for igf <dig>  dlk <dig> and meg <dig> detected at their respective dna locus positions, thereby discriminating between the two parental alleles. h <dig> was clearly monoallelically expressed in fetal porcine liver cells. however, its imprinting status in fetal muscle cells was difficult to determine because we detected more than one rna spot in a high percentage of cells : these spots were either located close to dna alleles and/or elsewhere in the nucleus. there are two plausible explanations: 1) the expression of h <dig> in this tissue and at this stage of development is not strictly monoallelic; 2) h <dig> rna signals may migrate in a condensed form into smaller foci, adopting a beads-on-a-string pattern within the nucleus. the maternal h <dig> allele expresses several rnas including a  <dig>  kb long non-coding h <dig> rna  and a large antisens h <dig> nuclear transcript . in mouse, lncrna has been shown to be an effective player that functions as a trans-regulator that can silence nine target coexpressed genes of the ign , likely important for fetal development and early postnatal growth control  <cit> . the 91h rna is another player in igf <dig> transcriptional regulation, but it is a short-lived nuclear transcript found in small quantities relative to h <dig> lncrna. the most likely hypothesis is that we visualized migration of h <dig> lncrna towards their targets. therefore, we were not able to use the h <dig> rna spots to label the maternal allele.

one of many mechanisms that control gene expression, dynamic gene repositioning in the nuclear space in response to different cell stimuli optimizes the regulation of gene expression. in particular, transcriptionally active genes are positioned on the edge of a ct and tend to relocate to specialized subnuclear compartments . thus, correlations between gene repositioning and transcriptional status have been well demonstrated for specific genes that switch from the silent to the active state during differentiation and development processes . monoallelically expressed genes are useful for investigating the relationship between nuclear positioning and gene activity by the comparison of the nuclear position of active and inactive alleles within the same cell nucleus. various examples have provided some evidence for function-related differential positioning of alleles within the interphase nucleus  <cit> . for example, takizawa et al.  <cit>  observed a significantly different radial position  of the stochastic expressed il <dig> and adipocyte marker gfap alleles compared with their respective non-expressed alleles. similarly, gribnau et al.  <cit>  found cell-type-specific differences in the nuclear localization of the two expressed parental igf <dig> and h <dig> alleles in mouse embryonic stem  and fetal liver cells. in this study, we focused on the localization of alleles with regard to their own ct. we identified the position of the expressed igf <dig> alleles, with a tendency to be outside the ssc <dig> ct. however, there was no significant statistical difference between the two alleles probably because igf <dig>  like many other imprinted genes, is embedded in a gene-dense chromosomal region with about  <dig> adjacent imprinted genes, including maternally expressed imprinted genes. therefore, it is important to consider the whole environment of the genomic locus rather than only the gene itself to fully understand its 3d architecture.

trans-association with igf2
we observed that igf <dig> was frequently positioned at the edge of the ct. this position may favor trans-associations with other loci important for gene regulation. in this study, we focused on trans-associations involving igf <dig> and found three imprinted genes located on different chromosomes  and  physically associated or colocalized in the nucleus. the expected frequency of random colocalization has been defined to be less than 1 %  <cit> . sandhu et al. determined an average interaction frequency of 2 % for controls  <cit> . in our experiment, non-expressed genes chosen as negative controls were found associated in 7 % of cells . however, others  <cit>  consider that trans-interactions detected in 8 % of the cells are significant. this raises the question of the difficulty in choosing non-associating controls. nevertheless, the high frequency of the associations found in this study clearly indicate their significance.

in the past 10 years, gene interactions have been studied on the whole genome scale by derived 3c approaches  <cit> . interestingly, imprinted genes have been shown to be overrepresented among the regions implicated in intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions despite their small number . this overrepresentation and the non-probabilistic nature of allelic expression suggest that epigenetic mechanisms — such as the different methylation status of the icr in paternal and maternal alleles, their different ctcf binding sites and allele-specific patterns of 3d organization  <cit>  — are probably involved in their propensity to associate with other loci. thus, several studies on different mouse cell types, have revealed trans-interactions between igf2/h <dig> and other genes, suggesting that physical networks of imprinted genes are relatively common  <cit> . our data are in agreement with this hypothesis because all tested imprinted genes  showed a high percentage of association with igf <dig> and these genes were also highly expressed in pig. this result suggests that imprinting and high expression drive these associations. in neonatal mouse liver, zhao et al.  <cit>  found trans-interactions between the igf2/h <dig> domain  and abcg <dig>  and osbpl1a  in  <dig> to 12 % of cells, respectively. in mouse es cells and neonatal liver, seven imprinted genes have been shown to interact in a pairwise manner in  <dig> to 14 % of the nuclei  <cit> . by using the same criteria of 3d center-to-center distances, we showed that igf <dig> and dlk1/meg <dig> loci associated in  <dig> to 36 % of the fetal porcine liver and muscle cells respectively.

by performing 3d rna/dna fish, we showed that it is the paternal igf <dig> allele that associates frequently with the dlk1/meg <dig> locus in fetal liver  and muscle cells . although available previous data have shown that the maternal h <dig> icr is preferentially involved in trans-interactions  <cit> , and particularly with dlk <dig>  <cit> , our results demonstrate that the paternally expressed igf <dig> allele is also clearly involved in trans-interactions. the higher percentage obtained in fetal tissue may be related to the fact that the levels of expression of these genes are higher at fetal stages than in neonatal stages in pigs and sheep  <cit> . we also detected pairwise rna associations: ,  in relatively similar percentages of cells  respectively and a triple association  in 13 % of cells. this result illustrates that the paternal igf <dig> allele associates with both dlk <dig> and meg <dig> loci located on the two homologous ssc <dig>  simultaneous interactions between more than two imprinted domains called a “party interaction” between h <dig>  ins <dig>  dlk <dig> dnas have been reported; their low frequency  is attributed to the dynamic, transient character of the association  <cit> . it would be interesting to verify if these contacts depend on each other and occur in common specialized transcription factories  <cit> , as demonstrated previously in erythroid cells  <cit> . within the nfkb-regulated multigene complex, perturbation disrupting a loop-mediated contact may drastically affect the transcription of other interacting genes involved in both cis and trans contacts  <cit> . thus, there is evidence that such chromatin looping is regulated in a hierarchical manner, suggesting that gene looping has a significant impact on the cotranscription of some interacting genes. this cooperation between active coregulated genes may boost the expression of these genes.

in mammalian cells, interaction studies based on hi-c approaches nevertheless reveal that genomic proximity is not the only factor. distinct chromosomal domains tend to have their own preferred interaction partners: active ones preferentially interacting with other active ones  through a partitioning of chromosomes into topologically associated domains   <cit> . our data are in agreement with these observations: igf <dig> and dlk <dig> loci are located in gene-dense chromosomal regions called regions of increased gene expression   <cit> .

our data demonstrate that ssc <dig> and ssc <dig> were close together in a high percentage of liver cells compared with associating igf2- loci, suggesting that chromatin looping may exist before target gene expression  and/or persist after transcription as previously suggested  <cit> . we hypothesize that the proximity of ct promotes locus interactions. however, to confirm this hypothesis some additional information is needed: the estimation of the probability that two loci interact randomly based on the proximity of their ct and the analysis of other loci on these ct.

otherwise, the degrees of intermingling between cts, the fragility of the decondensed chromatin loop in transcription-active domains, have been shown to be functionally relevant in determining the outcome of translocation  <cit> . several cytogenetic studies, especially in cancer research, have shown that translocation-prone gene partners are preferentially found in close spatial proximity in normal cells before translocation events . trans-interactions and chromosomal translocations seem to be correlated, especially when transcriptional loci present some sequence homology . in our case, the igf2/h <dig> imprinted cluster is shown to share many features  with the dlk1/meg <dig> region. through the chromosomal diagnostic activities in our laboratory, we have found two translocations involving the identified chromosomal regions t carrying respectively igf <dig> and dlk <dig> . knowledge on 3d nuclear organization, especially of active genes that tend to cluster, will help shed light on chromosome translocation mechanisms by identifying gene partners  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a view of the spatial organization of igf <dig> alleles in porcine fetal liver and muscle cells. in regard to their cts, no differences in 3d positions was found between expressed and non-expressed igf <dig> alleles in liver cells. focusing on the expressed igf <dig> allele using 3d rna-dna fish, we report three significant findings. firstly, we confirmed the widespread observations of physical associations between imprinted domains in different tissues  and species including pig. secondly, we completed previous studies that showed a preferential maternal h <dig> icr implication in interactions by demonstrating that the paternal igf <dig> allele is also highly involved in trans-associations with the dlk1/meg <dig> region. together, our results suggest that the two parental igf2/h <dig> regions are involved in gene associations. thirdly, we investigated these associations and showed that the paternally expressed igf <dig> allele associates simultaneously with both the paternally expressed dlk <dig> and maternally expressed meg <dig> alleles in muscle cells.

although most studies on imprinting have been performed on mouse models or in the context of human biomedical disorders, imprinted genes hold promise for research in domestic livestock for their putative major effects on complex phenotypic traits. for example, dlk <dig> and neighboring meg <dig> genes located in the region of the callipyge locus responsible for muscle hypertrophy in sheep  <cit>  are interesting candidate genes for economically important traits. various studies have shown their role in the regulation of adipogenesis, in muscle development and fetal growth . similarly, igf <dig> plays an essential role in growth and differentiation. these genes are associated with qtls for growth and fattening and consequently in meat quality-related traits  <cit> . determining whether the imprinted gene network is conserved between species and the role of new factors  in gene interactions will help to understand mechanisms associated with imprinted genes, but also may have implications for future animal breeding research  <cit> .
