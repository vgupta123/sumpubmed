BACKGROUND
the hypothesis of an ancestral era during the evolution of life known as the "rna world"  <cit> , originally proposed by woese  <cit> , orgel  <cit> , and crick  <cit> , has been strengthened by the discovery of catalytic rna molecules   <cit> , and by the fundamental role played by rna in many biological processes, particularly in ribosome structure and function  <cit> . according to this hypothesis, rna, or an rna-like molecule, both stored genetic information and catalyzed chemical reactions, thus resolving the "chicken-and-egg" paradox of which came first, proteins or nucleic acids  <cit> .

in vitro selection experiments and observations concerning natural ribozymes have demonstrated that the range of catalytic capacities of rna is larger and more promising than previously thought  <cit> . however, in comparison with proteins, the chemical repertoire of ribozymes remains limited because of the limited chemical diversity of rna, which is composed of only four different building blocks with few reactive functional groups. rna chemical diversity in the rna world could have been enhanced by the incorporation of catalytic building blocks such as imidazoles, thiols, and amino and carboxylate groups  <cit> , or catalytically functional modified nucleotides  <cit> . moreover, first rna species could have bound exogenous molecules carrying reactive groups, such as adenine, using them as catalytic cofactors  <cit> .

if the rna world ever existed, however, it is unlikely to have developed in a dilute aqueous solution, due to the difficulty of polymerization reactions and the instability of polymers in this environment  <cit> . moreover, with no ozone layer, the primordial earth was likely a hostile place for newly formed macromolecules. it is now generally held that the uv radiation flux at the earth's surface four billion years ago was approximately  <dig> times greater than today's, and would have been able to degrade most organic molecules  <cit> . effects of uv irradiation on biomolecules such as dna and rna range from breaking of the pentose-phosphate backbone to the formation of pyrimidine dimers  <cit> , and are thus considered a major obstacle to the theory of the rna world. several hypotheses have been proposed to solve the problem  <cit> , the first being bernal's  <dig> suggestion  <cit> . bernal proposed that the various steps towards the formation of very complex molecules must have required the presence of a protected confined environment, namely a clay-rich setting, where the biomolecules could originate, accumulate, and evolve while protected not only from uv irradiation, but also from other possible degrading agents.

numerous studies have reinforced the hypothesis of a clay-mediated origin of life. these include the synthesis of nucleotide components in the presence of clay minerals  <cit>  and their polymerization into oligonucleotides up to the length of a small ribozyme, with or without the need of a primer  <cit> . the work of hanczyc et al.  <cit>  showed that clays and other minerals can favour the spontaneous conversion of fatty acids into vesicles, with the encapsulation of clay-adsorbed rna molecules. this suggests a simple solution to the problem of primitive compartmentalization. clay minerals were also shown to enhance some ribozyme reactions, such as self-cleavage of hammerheads present in viroid transcripts  <cit> .

in addition, laboratory studies on the fate of dna in different habitats have demonstrated the role of clay minerals in its environmental protection against both biotic  and abiotic  degrading agents, still maintaining biological activities such as the ability to transform competent bacterial cells  <cit> . with regard to rna, studies carried out in the last years have shown that clay-adsorbed rnas are able to persist in the presence of rnases, to transmit the information contained in their sequence, and to interact with other molecules present in the environment  <cit> .

the above observations suggest that clay minerals could have played a central role in the formation and preservation of ancestral genetic material on the early earth  <cit> , promoting their persistence in primordial habitats.

it is crucial to understand how nucleic acid-like molecules in clay mineral environments might have been protected and biochemically favoured to undergo specific chemical reactions, triggering the molecular evolution that led to the first cells.

with this aim, we investigated the ability of the clay mineral montmorillonite to protect a catalytic rna molecule, the adhr <dig>  hairpin ribozyme  <cit> , against uv irradiation. in particular, we studied the self-cleavage reaction carried out by this ribozyme after the treatment of the molecule with uv light at  <dig> nm in the presence and absence of clay mineral particles.

RESULTS
the ability of adhr <dig> to self-cleave after treatment with uv light was tested subjecting the molecules to irradiation at  <dig> nm in free aqueous solution, and in the presence of montmorillonite clay particles.

two equivalent samples of adhr <dig> were subjected to a denaturation/renaturation step, to obtain the most stable conformation of the molecules before treatments. then,  <dig> mg/ml of montmorillonite, or the same volume in water, were added to the samples. both preparations, with a final rna concentration of  <dig> × 10- <dig> m, were subjected to uv irradiation for 5'.

after treatment, irradiated molecules were tested for the retention of self-cleavage activity. two parallel kinetic reactions were performed at 23°c adding a self-cleavage buffer to the samples, leading to the following final reaction conditions :  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> mm adenine,  <dig> mm hepes ph  <dig> , with a final rna concentration of  <dig> × 10- <dig> m, and  <dig> mg/ml montmorillonite in the reaction performed on the sample treated in the presence of clay particles.

two control kinetic reactions, in the absence and in the presence of the mineral, were also performed by subjecting adhr <dig> to all the same conditions as the former ones, but without uv irradiation.

samples were taken at different times: 0', 5', 10', 30',  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h, quenched in equal volumes of a stop solution containing formamide and edta, and run on denaturing 10% page. after ethidium bromide staining, the percentages of self-cleavage at each time were calculated and plotted versus time . curve fitting was performed using the equation ft = f∞, where ft is the fraction of cleaved products at time t, f∞ is the fraction of cleaved products at the equilibrium, and kobs is the observed rate constant of the reaction.

the results showed marked protection against uv irradiation performed by montmorillonite particles on adhr <dig> self-cleavage. indeed, the self-cleavage reaction of adhr <dig> previously irradiated in the presence of mineral particles showed very little decrease in the reaction parameters, with 58% self-cleavage at equilibrium and kobs =  <dig>  min- <dig>  while the same parameters of its control were 64% and  <dig>  min- <dig>  respectively. these data correspond to less than 10% reduction of the self-cleavage at the plateau, with respect to the control reaction, and an unchanged kobs. in contrast, the ribozyme free in solution, compared to its control reaction, performed a slower, less-efficient catalysis, with 30% self-cleavage at equilibrium and a kobs =  <dig>  min- <dig>  the parameters for the adhr <dig> control reaction free in solution  were roughly the same of the control in the presence of clay particles, with 63% self-cleavage at the plateau, and kobs =  <dig>  min- <dig>  thus, a decay in both the percentage of self-cleavage at the plateau and in the observed kinetic constant was shown, calculated as a 50% and a 40% decrease, respectively.

to better analyze the effect of protection against uv light at  <dig> nm performed by montmorillonite on adhr <dig> hairpin ribozyme, different irradiation times were also checked.

several equal aliquots of adhr <dig> were prepared as described above, with  <dig> mg/ml of montmorillonite, or the same volume in water, and the samples subjected to uv irradiation for the following periods: 30", 1', 3', 5', 10', 30', and  <dig> h.

all samples were then subjected to self-cleavage as previously described. aliquots were taken at different times, quenched in stop solution, and loaded on denaturing 10% page. gels were stained with ethidium bromide, or sybrgold in the cases in which very few amounts of self-cleavage products were detected. quantifications of self-cleavage products were performed as above, and data from each kinetic were fitted.

fractions of cleaved products at equilibrium  calculated for each experiment, in the presence and absence of montmorillonite, were normalized by f∞0

results obtained clearly showed an important effect of protection of montmorillonite on the ribozyme activity. adhr <dig> self-cleavage efficiency decreased exponentially with increasing times of irradiation, until only 7% self-cleavage products after 30' irradiation, and complete loss of activity with an uv treatment of  <dig> h. in contrast, montmorillonite-protected adhr <dig> exposed to uv radiations showed far less decay of activity with increasing exposure time, retaining 30% of activity after 30' of uv exposure, and 13% after  <dig> h of irradiation. the time constants of the exponential decay fittings for the two sets of experiments were calculated, and gave values of  <dig> min and  <dig> min for the experiments in the presence of montmorillonite and in its absence, respectively. thus, the life time for irradiated rna was three times longer with montmorillonite than in free aqueous solution.

moreover, no degradation or strand breaks of the hairpin ribozyme could be seen in any of the kinetic experiments with or without clay particles, even after long periods of exposure . this indicates that retention of activity in the presence of montmorillonite is not due to protection from aspecific degradation, but probably to the impediment of the formation of cross-linkages in the ribozyme sequence, which could prevent the correct folding and the consequent catalysis.

this possibility was supported by the detection of two bands running above the one corresponding to adhr <dig> in the gels of the kinetics performed after 30' and  <dig> h irradiation in free aqueous solution, bands which were not present , or less abundant , in the corresponding reactions performed after irradiation in the presence of clay . these bands could be the adhr <dig> counterparts of different forms of hairpin ribozyme-substrate complexes coming from specific inter- and/or intramolecular cross-linkages which could prevent self-cleavage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we reported the results of studies on the protection of the catalytic rna molecule adhr <dig> from uv irradiation performed by the clay mineral montmorillonite.

this aptamer, which needs adenine as a cofactor for both its self-cleavage and re-ligation reactions, is of great interest considering the prebiotic rna world hypothesis. indeed, adenine may itself be a prebiotic analog of histidine and could have been used by ribozymes of the rna world in the same way as histidine is used by modern enzymes  <cit> .

as already mentioned, in the absence of an ozone layer, the environment in which the rna world would have originated and developed was likely exposed to a much higher uv flux. biomolecules would have needed some form of uv shielding to protect them from this massive irradiation. these results suggest that clay minerals could have provided a mechanism for the protection of rna, or rna-like molecules, from uv irradiation.

results obtained from adhr <dig> self-cleavage experiments at increasing irradiation times showed significant protection against uv radiation afforded by montmorillonite particles, with a three-fold retention of the activity for the clay-protected ribozyme.

the finding of bands which could correspond to inter- and/or intra-molecular cross-linkages in the samples irradiated in free aqueous solution, but not in the ones exposed to uv-rays in the presence of montmorillonite, suggests a direct involvement of the mineral in preventing uv-induced structure rearrangements, which, in other hairpin systems, were shown to prevent correct folding and catalysis  <cit> .

these studies extend and strengthen previous investigations on the biogenic properties of rna molecules in a clay environment, aimed at assessing the possibility of the development of the rna world on mineral substrates  <cit> . such an environment could have favoured not only the formation of rna oligomers, but also their evolution towards increasingly complex molecular organization  <cit> .

it can be speculated that an rna-like world could have arisen in microstructures present inside clay minerals, in an environment rich in phosphate and in contact with aqueous solutions containing the simple organic precursors of primordial genetic molecules. this setting could have allowed the concentration of precursors on the surface of mineral particles, the catalysis of their polymerization into macromolecules, and the protection of the resulting polymers against environmental degradation . this could have provided primitive genetic polymers with the time necessary to evolve towards an increasingly complex organization, triggering the molecular evolution that led to the first living cells.
