BACKGROUND
heterococcus is a genus of yellow-green microalgae  that is common and widespread in soils of cold regions such as the alps or antarctica  <cit> . in addition to soils, three species have been reported from freshwater  <cit> , and heterococcus is the only xanthophyte known from lichen symbiosis  <cit> . heterococcus produces extensively branched filaments when grown on agarized culture medium ; however, in field samples it produces unicellular coccoid cells that are weakly connected. perhaps uniquely for microalgal genera, all species have been described based upon isolates grown in culture and observed with a light microscope  <cit> . without culturing, heterococcus is often mistaken for other coccoid xanthophytes, eustigmatophytes or green algae. sixty-one heterococcus species have been described  <cit> , and  <dig> species are recognized  <cit> . extensive ultrastructural observations were undertaken by lokhorst  <cit> , but he reluctantly concluded that ultrastructural features were not sufficient to distinguish species. 

sexual reproduction is unknown for heterococcus, and therefore the biological species concept cannot be employed ; only the morphological  species concept has been used. that is, heterococcus species identity is limited to light microscopic morphological characters interpreted within the extensive plasticity that is exhibited during culture studies  <cit> . for example, branching patterns are not present in very young or old cultures, and filament formation is suppressed  when cultures are grown at suboptimal temperature ranges  <cit>  . cladistic analysis of these morphological features would be extremely difficult because cell sizes, branching patterns, colony growth, chloroplast number and other features overlap extensively among the species, even when grown under optimum conditions.

molecular phylogenetic analysis is often a reliable alternative for identification of species; however, species diversity of heterococcus using molecular markers was unstudied and no molecular reference data base existed. from only seven heterococcus species dna sequences had previously been reported, and all these sequences were from conserved molecular markers. the sequences revealed the probable monophyletic origin of the genus and its basal position within the xanthophyceae, which was distinct from other filamentous members   <cit> . we used molecular phylogenetics, especially within the framework of the monophyletic species concept  <cit> , to evaluate  <dig> culture strains identified as heterococcus . fourteen strains were originally identified to species level using morphology, and ten of those strains were authentic culture strains, i.e. the culture strains used to describe the species  <cit> . unfortunately, the cultures used to describe all other species have been lost. for nine authentic strains, there are extended morphological descriptions with numerous illustrations produced by two independent authors  <cit> . we added  <dig> unidentified culture isolates, including twelve cultures recently isolated. our goals were  to test boundaries of heterococcus species as inferred from morphological features and  to establish a reference data base of strains unambiguously distinguished with dna sequence data. we chose two highly variable molecular markers, i.e. the chloroplast-encoded psba/rbcl spacer region  <cit>  and the nuclear-encoded internal transcribed spacer  <dig> of the nuclear rdna cistron  <cit> , to examine species boundaries. we also determined full plastid-encoded rbcl gene sequences to infer the phylogenetic position of species. 

RESULTS
four of the strains, identified as heterococcus, were green algae . these were not included in the rest of the study. the rbcl gene sequences were used to assess the phylogenetic relationships of the remaining  <dig> strains . for  <dig> strains, pcr amplification was successful for the whole region from psba , through the rbcl, through the rbcl/rbcs spacer and to the rbcs gene; therefore the full rbcl gene,  <dig> base pairs long, was determined . we failed to obtain full rbcl sequences for three authentic strains, heterococcus fuornensis vischer strain sag 835– <dig>  h. caespitosus vischer strain sag 835-2a, and h. protonematoides vischer strain sag 835– <dig>  but we used available sequences  for these three strains. also, for strains db14- <dig> and mz1- <dig> the full rbcl failed to amplify. fifteen different rbcl sequences were recovered among the  <dig> strains, which implies that the rbcl gene was identical among many strains . only the  <dig> different rbcl sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses . monophyly of heterococcus was highly supported with all methods except maximum likelihood, and this confirmed the generic identity of the  <dig> strains. the analyses resolved two well supported clades, named “h. caespitosus clade” and “h. viridis clade”. in addition, there were three independent lineages representing h. crassulus vischer, h. fuornensis and an unidentified strain . relationships among the clades and lineages remained ambiguous .

psba/rbcl spacer
to further examine the relationships, the psba/rbcl spacer sequences were determined for  <dig> strains . the spacers varied greatly in length and primary sequences; the sequences could not be aligned across all strains. nevertheless, two short sequence stretches were aligned across all strains. the first was  <dig> nucleotides at the 5’-end  and the second was  <dig> nucleotides at the 3’-end .

in most heterococcus strains the nucleotide length of the psba/rbcl spacer ranged from  <dig> nucleotides  to  <dig> nucleotides . the sequence for h. crassulus strain sag 835– <dig> was  <dig> nucleotides, and the identical sequences for two strains, db14-1- <dig> and db14-5- <dig>  were  <dig> nucleotides. sequence similarities further downstream grouped the strains into seven “spacer groups”, a – g, within which the psba/rbcl spacers were identical or displayed only very few differences . when mapped on the rbcl phylogeny, the strains of spacer groups a, b and c were included in the h. viridis clade, strains of spacer groups d and e fell in the h. caespitosus clade, and spacer groups f and g represented the lineages “h. sp.” and h. crassulus .

between closely related groups or within a group, also other regions of the psba/rbcl spacer sequences could be aligned. for example, strains of the heterococcus viridis clade  had sequence regions that aligned well, but there were up to  <dig> nucleotide differences among them. in addition, there was a hypervariable region of different lengths  that was not alignable among the three groups, but clearly distinguished them from each other. in the h. caespitosus clade, i.e. between groups d and e, the psba/rbcl spacers also aligned well over the entire lengths, but differed at  <dig> sequence positions and a single indel. similarly, there was a maximum of  <dig> psba/rbcl spacer sequence differences between strains of group a. in group a there were nine strains isolated from antarctica . there were no more than two nucleotides difference among them when antarctic strain mz3- <dig> was not considered and the previously unidentified strain sag  <dig> , isolated from germany, had just one to three sequence differences with the eight antarctic isolates. conversely, strain mz3- <dig> was with seven to nine spacer differences more distant to the other eight antarctic strains. strain h. brevicellularis vischer sag 835– <dig> was the closest neighboring strain of strain mz3-7; there were just  <dig> sequence positions different between both strains. group b contained two antarctic strains  that had identical spacers; group b also contained two german strains  with identical spacers; however, the antarctic strains differed at  <dig> positions when compared to the german strains. finally, group d had three strains that had only one nucleotide difference, while two strains in group f had only two sequence differences.

its2
nuclear-encoded its <dig> sequences were determined for  <dig> strains as an independent assessment of the plastid-encoded sequences. heterococcus fuornensis strain sag 835– <dig> was successfully amplified and included; however, amplification failed for strain mz1- <dig> and this strain was not included in the its <dig> analyses. based upon alignment similarity, the its <dig> sequences formed the same groups that were recovered in the psba/rbcl spacer analysis; therefore, we used the same group notation for both datasets. within a spacer group, the its <dig> sequences and their secondary structures were easily aligned and rather similar; conversely, between spacer groups, the sequences and secondary structures were highly variable, i.e. they could be aligned with confidence only for a few short segments. the its <dig> sequences exhibited a considerable length variation of up to about  <dig> nucleotides between spacer groups. the shortest its <dig> had  <dig> nucleotides ; the longest sequence had  <dig> nucleotides . within each spacer group, the its <dig> sequences were relatively constant in length , except for group d where sequences were either short  or long , and the difference was due to an indel at the terminal end of helix iii in the secondary structure model . the its <dig> sequence from heterococcus fuornensis, which had a distinctive rbcl gene but could not be amplified for the psba/rbcl spacer, showed little similarity to other spacer groups.

the inferred rna secondary structures folded into the common core structure known for eukaryotes  <cit>  which consisted of four helices with the third being the longest and helix iv the shortest . because of the high sequence length variation there was not a single its <dig> secondary structure from which the secondary structure models of the remaining sequences could be deduced using homology modeling. only helix ii could be modeled throughout the set of sequences independent of the used sequence-structure pair. however, within each group complete secondary structures could be obtained by homology modeling . throughout the set of sequences, conserved regions were restricted to the entire helix ii , which had a constant length of  <dig> nucleotides, and a segment of about  <dig> nucleotides  located at or close to the distal end of helix iii . it was followed by an extended terminal end of the helix iii of  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in spacer groups d and f, whereas the corresponding sequence region in other spacer groups comprised of six  to  <dig> nucleotides . that means there was a continuous lengthening/shortening of the its <dig> helix iii within heterococcus . another conserved its <dig> region useful to distinguish groups among heterococcus strains was an unpaired sequence segment  adjacent to helix ii . it separated h. crassulus sag 835– <dig>  h. fuornensis sag 835– <dig>  and two clusters of strains from each other. the one cluster comprised the strains from groups a-c, the other the strains from groups d-f. within each cluster the sequence segments were invariant. 

multiple copies of its <dig> were recovered in eight strains , i.e. there were no clear sequence reads possible without cloning. four to  <dig> clones per strain were sequenced and this revealed up to seven its <dig> variants per strain . differences between its <dig> variants consisted of one to seven sequence positions and a few small indels ; they were mostly located in helices i, iv and the basal part of helix iii preceding the conserved segment. in groups b and d differences between its <dig> variants were also located in the conserved helix ii. in group d three out of the ten detected its <dig> variants were lacking the extended  <dig> nucleotides long terminal end of helix iii. these shorter variants were present in all three strains of group d or in about half  out of the sequenced  <dig> clones, while the longer its <dig> variants were retrieved only from two strains, eif 423/a790- <dig> and eif 128/a788- <dig> 

the its <dig> phylogenetic analyses were confined to helix ii  for assessing relationships among all studied strains. the sequence alignment was with  <dig> positions relatively short; it contained no more than 14/ <dig> variable/parsimony informative sites and just nine sequences were not identical with others. however, a well-resolved phylogeny was obtained when secondary structure was considered in addition to primary structure information . the resolved helix ii sequence groups were congruent with the groups recovered in the rbcl phylogeny . a common origin of h. crassulus with h. fuornensis was well supported in the unrooted its <dig>  phylogeny, and this contrasted with the rbcl phylogeny where the relationships of both were unresolved . also an unrooted  phylogeny of only heterococcus rbcl gene sequences did not support the common origin of both species . the helix ii phylogenetic tree resolved a close relationship of groups d and e , but at the same time both groups were clearly separated species because there were two cbcs  <cit>  in helices ii and iii ; also their helices i and iv could not be aligned. no resolution was provided within the h. viridis clade, i.e. among spacer groups a, b and c . the complete its <dig> sequence was used to produce phylogenetic trees for individual spacer groups or rbcl clades. for example, then within the rbcl h. viridis clade the spacer groups a-c were resolved . within group a, both variants of strain mz3- <dig> shared a common origin and were separated from other strains of the group. the three authentic strains, heterococcus viridis sag 835– <dig>  h. mainxii sag 835– <dig>  and h. marietanii sag 835– <dig>  shared identical its <dig> sequences with each other . similarly, the its <dig> sequences of the two antarctic strains eif  <dig> and eif pab 398/ <dig> were identical . two authentic strains, h. brevicellularis sag 835– <dig> and h. moniliformis sag 835– <dig>  and one unidentified strain  shared identical its <dig> sequences except for a short indel  in helix iv. another congruence with the chloroplast-encoded data was within group e where the its <dig> sequences of two authentic strains, h. caespitosus sag 835-2a and h. protonematoides sag 835– <dig>  were identical. conversely, within group b no differentiation among strains was possible due to the extensive radiation of multiple its <dig> variants of strain mz1- <dig> . similarly, group d had extensive radiation of its <dig> variants and no relationships among strains were resolved . here the shorter variants of both strains eif 423/a790- <dig> and eif pab 399/ <dig> were intermixed among each other; they formed two independent lineages distinct from a clade comprising the variants with extended terminal end of helix iii. within group f no clear distinction of the two strains db14-1- <dig>  and db14-5- <dig> was provided .

discussion
monophyletic species concept
our results show that morphological features do not characterize species; for example, we found that five authentic culture strains – used in the original descriptions for the five species – had nearly identical dna sequences and its <dig> secondary structures. furthermore, we found other examples where authentic strains or identified strains were synonymous with another species . almost all heterococcus species have been described using the same morphological approach, we have examined all existing authentic culture strains, and we find that morphological species descriptions are inadequate for this asexual genus. we conclude that morphological features characterize only individuals, not species. therefore, we must apply a different species concept for heterococcus.

the ‘monophyletic species concept’ of johansen and casamatta  <cit> , which is derived from the ‘phylogenetic  species concept’ of mishler and theriot  <cit> , is easily applied to asexual species when molecular data are available. in our study, the dna sequences and its <dig> secondary structure comparisons recovered a clear and robust phylogenetic structure for the  <dig> heterococcus strains. eight groups of sequences were repeatedly recovered using three different molecular markers; sequences within each group were very similar or identical while those between groups were highly variable. using the monophyletic species concept, we recognize these groups as eight distinct species, and we identify previously unidentified strains and environmental clones to species level.

in a previous study, the rbcl gene and psba/rbcl spacer were used, in conjunction with the monophyletic species concept, to define species in the tribonemataceae, another asexual lineage of filamentous xanthophyceae  <cit> . in that study, strains of the same species formed a monophyletic clade in the maximum likelihood rbcl gene phylogeny, and strains within the same species differed by less than  <dig> nucleotides. within each species, the psba/rbcl spacer was easily aligned, and within species variation was limited to single nucleotide differences and short indels. as with our study, the entire spacer could not be aligned between species. therefore, the molecular-based monophyletic species concept identifies species in the same way for both studies.

the original iconotypes used to nomenclaturally anchor all heterococcus names consist of ink drawings of various morphological features. we have shown that these morphological features are not reliable for species identity, and ink drawings are very limited for reference. in some cases, neotype material was dried and deposited in a herbarium  <cit> , but this too is ambiguous because in at least one case, the wrong culture was used  and because the material does not clearly separate species . therefore, the names are herein further anchored with epitypes to avoid all ambiguity. the epitypes here designated are cryopreserved culture strains that can be re-investigated. the nomenclatural details are summarized below.

taxonomy and nomenclature
group a strains differed by no more than five sequence positions  in their rbcl genes, and the psba/rbcl spacer regions aligned well over their entire lengths, with no more than  <dig> sequence differences. their its <dig> sequences also aligned well over their entire lengths and there were no more than eight its <dig> sequence positions different. therefore, we regard group a as a single species, heterococcus viridis, which is the type species for the genus. it is noteworthy that we used chodat’s  <cit>  authentic strain, sag 835– <dig>  <cit> . group a also contained four additional species that were based upon authentic strains, h. brevicellularis, h. mainxii, h. marietanii and h. moniliformis <cit> . we conclude that interpretations of largely overlapping morphological features, which were used to establish these as separate species, are not taxonomically sound; therefore, we consider these to be heterotypic synonyms of h. viridis . previously, lokhorst  <cit>  found that three of these strains were morphologically almost indistinguishable and he considered them as varieties. group a also includes two strains previously identified as h. pleurococcoides pitschmann  <cit> . however, the two strains were not authentic strains, and we cannot completely conclude that h. pleurococcoides is a heterotypic synonym of h. viridis. in addition, eight unidentified strains are now identified as h. viridis based on our study .

two authentic strains in group e, h. caespitosus sag 835-2a and h. protonematoides sag 835– <dig>  were identical when considering the three markers. we recognize group e as a single species. h. caespitosus was described first  <cit> , and therefore has nomenclatorial priority over h. protonematoides <cit> , which becomes a heterotypic synonym.

for group g, h. crassulus was represented by an authentic strain, and we accept this as a recognized species. similarly, for an unnamed group , h. fuornensis was represented by an authentic strain, and therefore we recognize this as a distinct species.

in group b, there were no more than nine different sequence positions  among the complete rbcl sequences and only four nucleotide differences among the psba/rbcl spacers. strains of group b formed a well-supported monophyletic clade independent of other groups/species in the rbcl phylogeny  as well as phylogenetic analysis of the whole its <dig> region . therefore, we recognize group b as a distinct species. placing a scientific name on group b  is problematic because our study included all existing authentic cultures. our molecular data, which were rigorously analyzed with phylogenetic methods, contradict species distinctions based upon non-rigorous intuition using highly variable morphological features, and we conclude that our rigorous analyses are more scientifically sound. nonetheless, there are  <dig> named species, and perhaps group  b belongs to one of those species. if we simply propose a new name, then we are defying the intent of the international code of botanical nomenclature . therefore, we simply apply four of the oldest names used in  <cit>  for group  b and the three other groups  which contained no authentic strains. we assume that none of these names is in contradiction with the morphology of the strains we designate to represent the four species. we argue that establishing axenic cultures and examining filaments at a certain age of a culture time  is a poor way to identify species and this does not allow field samples to be identified to species. with heterococcus growth in culture is a measure of meaningless differences and there is no hope that morphology will ever be useful when trying to put a name on these four groups . we suggest that close phylogenetic relationship with defined reference  strains as well as genetic distance from corresponding strains of other species, evidenced by rbcl gene phylogenies and differences in the psba/rbcl spacers are appropriate to identify the species. secondary structure of its <dig> constitutes an additional autapomorphic feature to define species of heterococcus. we use heterococcus conicus pitschmann as name for group  b.

group c consisted of a single strain, sag  <dig> , which formed a distinct lineage in the rbcl and full its <dig> phylogenies . it was also distinct in its psba/rbcl spacer from h. viridis and h. conicus which were the closest relatives with sag  <dig>  therefore, we recognize group c as a distinct species and we use heterococcus virginis pitschmann as name. two unidentified lichen photobionts share identical partial rbcl sequences  and these differed by only one nucleotide from sag  <dig>  therefore, we assign these lichen photobionts to h. virginis as well.

group d comprised three strains with no nucleotide difference in the rbcl and a single in the psba/rbcl spacer. in the its <dig> phylogeny, the three strains could not be distinguished due to different its <dig> variants that are intermixed . strains of group d exhibit a unique its <dig> secondary structure with a rather long helix iii with considerable length variation at its terminal end . despite being closely related to h. caespitosus  in the rbcl phylogeny  there are two cbcs in its <dig> that separate group d strains from the latter species. consequently, we recognize group d as a distinct species, heterococcus leptosiroides pitschmann. one environmental clone sequence from antarctic soils  shared full sequence identity in rbcl gene with group d strains, and therefore, we conclude that the environmental clone belongs to h. leptosiroides. group d included strains identified as h. caespitosus and h. protonematoides based on morphology; however, neither was an authentic culture and again we consider identification based on

finally, group f contained two strains with fully identical complete rbcl sequences and two differences in their psba/rbcl spacers. in the its <dig> phylogeny the two strains could not be distinguished due to the variation of multiple copies . the group f strains had a unique its <dig> secondary structure with a particularly long helix iii . group f forms an independent lineage within the heterococcus clade in the rbcl phylogeny . consequently, we recognize group f as a distinct species and use heterococcus ramosissimus pitschmann as name.

the authentic strain of h. endolithicus was described by darling and coworkers  <cit> , 195/a790- <dig> , but our study revealed that it represents a green alga, i.e. a close relative of desmococcus species  . our microscopic investigation of sag  <dig>  revealed the same morphology as described previously  <cit> . significantly, this morphology is somewhat similar to the morphology of desmococcus <cit> , and this makes us confident that sag  <dig>  still represents the original isolate. despite darling and coworkers  <cit>  having reported a “typical xanthophycean plastid structure” based on electron microscopy, they already considered h. endolithicus distinct from all other heterococcus species because it did not form long filaments. in addition, three more strains from antarctic soils were also identified as desmococcus-like green algae . therefore, we exclude h. endolithicus from the genus heterococcus and propose a new nomenclatural combination for this authentic strain, but unfortunately we cannot apply the specific epithet  because the name desmococcus endolithicus broady & ingerfeld already exists  <cit> . therefore, we propose an avowed substitute name:

infraspecific variation and geographical distribution
our relatively small sample of  <dig> heterococcus strains already showed eight groups . within the five species for which multiple strains were available, the psba/rbcl spacer sequences even resolved groups of strains with nearly identical sequences . strains with identical, or nearly identical, sequences were repeatedly found in our relatively small sample of heterococcus strains and, importantly, established at different times from geographically distant localities. this implies that the number of species within heterococcus might be rather limited. the same genotypes were confined to certain habitats  and geographical regions . for example, h. viridis strains sag 835– <dig>  sag 835– <dig> and sag835- <dig> were collected from freshwater habitats in europe while all other strains of the species were from soil in europe or antarctica ; they represent a distinct subgroup  within the species. similarly, two strains of h. conicus were collected from freshwater in europe  whereas the other two h. conicus strains were collected from antarctic soil . we draw two conclusions. first, the two species are geographically widespread and will grow where suitable habitats exist. second, genotypes of those growing in freshwater are distinct from those growing in soil. the sample size is exceedingly small, but there is a suggestion that our molecular data are separating populations within both species that have distinctly different habitats.

we also note that half of the heterococcus genotypes in our sample originated from antarctica but not a single genotype was shared between antarctic and european strains, i.e. none of the antarctic heterococcus strains shared identical psba/rbcl spacer sequences with the european strains. a previous study showed that antarctic strains within a single species of the xanthophyte xanthonema were distinguished from their temperate counterparts by only few nucleotides for the highly variable psba/rbcl spacers  <cit> . therefore, our findings for heterococcus support the view that the antarctic and temperate strains of xanthophyte species represent different populations of a single species. that is, the antarctic strains of a given species share their own common evolutionary histories, implying that there was only one  colonization event in antarctica for each species. alternatively, if multiple colonization events occurred, then the invasions were too recent to produce significant divergence  <cit> .

its <dig> sequence features
our its <dig> sequences are, to our knowledge, the first its <dig> sequences available for xanthophyceae. given that available its <dig> sequence information for stramenopile algae is still limited, two aspects of the heterococcus its <dig> sequences appear unusual, but might be useful for taxonomy. first, in heterococcus its <dig> lengths were approximately  <dig> nucleotides long in most strains; group f  sequences were almost  <dig> bps. the average length of its <dig> across all eukaryotes is about  <dig> bps as inferred from the its <dig> database iv  <cit> . in group d, two size classes occurred, i.e. either ~ <dig> or ~ <dig> bps, due to a large indel at the terminal end of helix iii. other stramenopile algal groups, the bacillariophyceae and phaeophyceae, show a bimodal distribution of their its <dig> sequence lengths, i.e. around 250/ <dig> bps and around 250/ <dig> bps, respectively. second, the its <dig> sequences were rather variable, i.e. only few and rather short sequence segments were alignable with confidence across the eight heterococcus species. such a high sequence variation among species of a single genus is unusual, at least as compared to genera and species of green algae where its <dig> has been revealed as a reliable molecular marker already many times, e.g.  <cit> . finally, because the its <dig> rdna sequences were so variable in heterococcus, it is not possible to safely define compensatory base changes , which can be deduced only from well aligned sequences. cbcs in conserved regions of the helices of its <dig> have been proposed for distinguishing microalgal species when sexual reproduction is unknown  <cit> . however, the concept of cbcs does not imply that two strains lacking cbcs must belong to the same species. that is, there may be other criteria that define microalgal species.

the high its <dig> sequence variability is in line with our maximum likelihood  analyses that had weak support for the monophyletic origin of the genus . the monophyletic origin of heterococcus was also weakly supported by a multiple gene phylogenetic analyses of photosynthetic stramenopiles that included three of our heterococcus species  <cit> . therefore, our results may suggest that more data  are required to firmly demonstrate the monophyly of heterococcus, or they may suggest that some of the species defined in our study belong to a separate, and sister, genus.

CONCLUSIONS
application of the monophyletic species concept using the highly variable chloroplast-encoded psba/rbcl spacer, the more conserved plastid rbcl gene, and the nuclear-encoded its <dig> provided a reference data base for unambiguous identification of the common cold soil microalga heterococcus. eight species were recognized and characterized at the molecular level. previous taxonomic studies relied entirely on morphological features produced in cultures; our data will facilitate diversity assessments that are independent of culturing. in addition, the pcr amplification approach for the psba/rbcl spacer is specific for xanthophyceae. using the new reference data base, partial sequences of the psba/rbcl spacer and/or its <dig> may already be sufficient for the assignment of a new strain to a certain species. there are some difficulties; amplification of the psba/rbcl spacer may be hampered by length variations, and sequence analyses of its <dig> may be complicated by multiple variants per strain. using the monophyletic species concept, our species are mostly in contrast to those defined by the morphological  species concept. we conclude that the extensive morphological plasticity displayed in culture cannot be interpreted without rigorous methods , and the largely overlapping morphological characteristics make cladistic analysis very difficult or impossible. the identical, but highly variable, sequences that were repeatedly recovered among the species, suggest that the species diversity of heterococcus is not extensive, especially considering the repetition that occurred in our small sampling from europe and antarctica. the observed sequence changes within a species may reflect adaptations to different types of habitats or climates and distinguish geographically widely separated strains.
