BACKGROUND
flavonoids are major secondary metabolites in plants. more than  <dig>  kinds of flavonoid derivatives are estimated to occur in plants  <cit> . such varieties of flavonoid subgroups include flavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanes, flavanols, isoflavones, and anthocyanidins, all of which originate from the phenylpropanoid synthesis pathway  <cit> . in plant cells, flavonoids are modified by many enzymes, such as methyltransferases, glycosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, acyltransferases, oxidases, and others. these modifications, coupled with the structural variation observed in different flavonoid subgroups, contribute to a huge diversity of flavonoids  <cit> .

it is well known that many flavonoids have significant roles in plants, such as inflorescence pigments and antioxidants as well as serving as substances with anti-pathogenic  <cit> , anti-insect  <cit> , and signaling functions  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that o-methylated flavonoids have significant biological activity in humans, exhibiting antibiotic  <cit> , antiviral  <cit> , anti-cancer  <cit> , anti-inflammatory  <cit> , anti-obesity  <cit> , neuroprotective  <cit> , and anti-allergy  <cit>  properties. increasing evidence of the effects of o-methylated flavonoids on human health suggests they can be used to enrich processed foods or in dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals. nobiletin  is one of the abundant polymethoxy flavonoids  in citrus depressa peels, and it has been reported to possess several bioactivities  <cit> . however, it is difficult to investigate nobiletin in general and medical research because of the small amounts of nobiletin obtained from citrus peels. in plant cells, hydroxyl groups of flavonoids are methylated by reactions with o-methyltransferase  using s-adenosyl-l-methionine  as a methyl donor.

plant omts are generally classified as either class i or class ii by their structural and enzymatic properties  <cit> . class i omts, which include the well-known enzyme caffeoyl-coa 3-omt , are characterized by low subunit molecular masses , dependence on mg2+ ions, and the ability to catalyze the methylation of 3-hydroxyl groups of caffeoyl-coa to produce feruloyl-coa. thus, ccoaomt, which is involved in lignin biosynthesis in plant cells, is the key enzyme for producing monolignols  <cit> . class ii omts have a higher subunit molecular mass than ccoaomts  and do not require mg2+ ions for methylation. plant cells accumulate many flavonoids through the reactions of such omts. ibrahim et al. reported that cell-free extracts of citrus mitis exhibited stepwise o-methylation activities for various flavonoids and suggested that different types of omts are involved in the biosynthesis of pmfs in some tissues   <cit> . more recently, it was reported that there are  <dig> omt genes in the c. sinensis  genome, and these genes show distinct expression patterns that differ among tissues and developmental stages  <cit> . these findings strongly suggested that the structural diversity of pmfs in citrus is caused by combinations of various types of substrate- and regio-specific methyltransferases.

here, we report the isolation and characterization of five flavonoid o-methyltransferase  genes  from c. depressa. furthermore, cdfomt <dig> was successfully expressed in e. coli as a functional enzyme, and its properties were characterized in detail. cdfomt <dig> possessed methyltransferase activity for quercetin, a ubiquitous flavonoid in plants, and exhibited a broad range of substrate specificity and regioselectivity toward 3-, 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxyl groups of flavones. using the biotransformation of quercetin in a cdfomt5-expressing e. coli biocatalyst, we successfully obtained  <dig> ′, <dig> -tetra-o-methylated quercetin as a final product, suggesting that the enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of nobiletin.

RESULTS
cloning of cdfomt genes from c. depressa
to isolate fomt-coding genes from c. depressa, we performed degenerate pcr using primers designed from the conserved amino acid sequences of higher plant fomts. using genomic dna as the template, we obtained five fragments, whose deduced amino acid sequences showed similarity to several higher plant fomts. in order to obtain the full-length fomt genes from c. depressa, we performed thermal asymmetric interlaced pcr  and obtained five fomt-coding genes, cdfomt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all primers used to clone cdfomt genes are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  then, we amplified full-length cdna of these cdfomt genes using specific primers designed from the deduced n-terminal and c-terminal sequences. thus, we isolated five fomt genes which encode homologous proteins cdfomt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the amino acid sequences of cdfomt <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed relatively high identities each other , although those of cdfomt <dig> and  <dig> showed lower identities  with other cdfomts .table  <dig> comparative identities  of amino acid sequences of five fomts from citrus depressa




a comparison of the genomic and cdna sequences revealed that these fomt genes contain one or three introns . all cdfomt genes contain an intron at the same position within their coding sequences , although these cdfomt genes show quite low similarities across their whole nucleotide sequences, and the proteins differed substantially in size. schroder et al.  <cit>  found that comt genes from catharanthus roseus share an intron insertion location. similarly, the amino acid sequences at this site in cdfomt genes were highly conserved across many plant omts. cdfomt <dig> and cdfomt <dig> each contained three introns, which also share positions within their amino acid sequences , though there were again large differences in both their sizes and sequences as proteins. this result suggests that these cdfomt genes have the same origin and acquired their introns during their shared evolutionary history.

the five newly isolated cdfomt genes from c. depressa encode  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues and shared 60–97 % amino acid sequence identities to known higher plant omts . figure  <dig> shows the alignment of the deduced cdfomt amino acid sequences and higher plant fomts. cdfomts exhibited several conserved sequences , which are likely involved in interactions with the cofactor sam  <cit> . the existence of these conserved regions suggests that the five omt genes obtained from c. depressa code for potential sam-dependent fomts.table  <dig> homologs of the cdfomt genes from citrus depressa in the databases

phylogenetic analysis of five cdfomts with  <dig> putative and defined plant class ii omts from higher plants  indicate that they are plant class ii omts . class ii omts are generally known to show activity with flavonoids and isoflavonoids  <cit> , while class i omts catalyze methylation of phenolic compounds involved in lignin synthesis  <cit> . these results suggest that the isolated cdfomts may be involved in the biosynthesis of pmfs such as nobiletin in c. depressa.fig.  <dig> a phylogenetic tree constructed from plant fomt amino acid sequences. in addition to sequences of cdfomts characterized in this paper,  <dig> plant class ii fomt sequences were also selected using blast search and aligned by clustalw. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the njplot program. arabidopsis thaliana , catharanthus roseus , chrysosplenium americanum , citrus sinensis , glycyrrhiza echinata , hordeum vulgare , lotus japonicus , medicago sativa , mentha × piperita , oryza sativa , populus trichocarpa , triticum aestivum , and zea mays 



expression of recombinant cdfomts genes in escherichia coli
in order to obtain recombinant enzymes, each cdfomt gene was cloned into a pet21b vector, and e. coli bl <dig> cells were transformed with a constructed plasmid. with the exception of the cdfomt <dig>  the four remaining cdfomts formed inclusion bodies under several culture conditions and no activity could be detected for these proteins. schroder et al.  <cit>  reported that three omt genes in catharanthus roseus  were tested for expression in e. coli, and recombinant cromt <dig> and cromt <dig> formed soluble proteins whereas cromt <dig> formed an insoluble protein. in general, expression of functional plant enzymes in e. coli is unpredictable and must be determined empirically with many factors such as amino acid composition, protein folding, and post translational modifications influencing the outcome. thus, the newly isolated methyltransferase genes other than cdfomt <dig> may contribute to biosynthesis of pmf in c. depressa, but details of their biochemical functions remain unclear. we were able to successfully express recombinant cdfomt <dig> in e. coli and confirm its omt activity. recombinant cdfomt <dig> was obtained as a fusion protein with a 6× histidine tag at the c-terminus and purified by ni-sepharose resin column chromatography. recombinant cdfomt <dig> was purified to homogeneity, and a single  <dig> -kda protein band was obtained by an sds-page analysis .fig.  <dig>

physicochemical properties of cdfomt5
using hplc, the molecular mass of recombinant cdfomt <dig> was estimated to be  <dig>  kda. the theoretical molecular mass of the recombinant cdfomt <dig> including the 6× histidine tag is  <dig>  kda, which agrees with the observed molecular mass of  <dig>  kda inferred using sds-page. it is generally known that typical plant fomt subunits are homodimers  <cit> . these findings suggest that recombinant cdfomt <dig> is a homodimer protein in e. coli cells.

the pi value of the enzyme without the 6× histidine tag based on its amino acid sequence was theoretically calculated to be  <dig> .

the effects of ph and temperature on omt activity were measured using quercetin as a substrate . recombinant cdfomt <dig> showed optimum activity at ph  <dig>  , and its activity fell more than 50 % at ph  <dig>   or ph  <dig>  . the optimum temperature of cdfomt <dig> was 45 °c, and the enzyme exhibited more than 80 % of maximum activity at 55 °c .

regioselectivity of cdfomt <dig> for quercetin
when o-methyltransferase activity was measured using quercetin as a substrate, several peaks corresponding to o-methylated products were detected by hplc analysis . the retention time for p <dig> was consistent with 3-o-methylquercetin, and that of p <dig> was consistent with azaleatin  or rhamnetin . however, p <dig> and p <dig> had retention times that differed from those of quercetin mono-methylated derivatives. to investigate the molecular mass of these compounds, we performed an lc-ms analysis and observed increases of 28- and 42-da in the molecular ion peaks for p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively . this demonstrates that cdfomt <dig> can catalyze the o-methylation of at least three hydroxyl groups of quercetin and that di- or tri-o-methylated quercetin products were obtained by this enzymatic reaction.fig.  <dig> hplc analysis of quercetin products methylated by cdfomt5: s, quercetin; p <dig>  3-o-methylated quercetin; p <dig>  azaleatin/rhamnetin; p <dig>  dimethylated quercetin; and p <dig>  trimethylated quercetin. the peak labeled with ‘x’ was not identified as corresponding to flavonoid derivatives. 



to confirm the regioselectivity of cdfomt <dig>  the enzymatic reaction was measured using mono-hydroxyflavones as a substrate. as shown in fig.  <dig>  cdfomt <dig> demonstrated methylation activity for 3-, 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxy groups of flavone. under the standard assay condition , the highest activity was observed for 3-hydroxyflavone  based on the peak area of the product, followed by 7-hydroxyflavone with a relative activity of  <dig>  % of that of 3-hydroxyflavone and 5-hydroxyflavone with that of  <dig>  %. very weak activity was observed for 6-hydroxyflavone , and no activity was detected for 3′- or 4′-hydroxyflavone and 7-methoxy-8-hydroxyflavone . this appears to be the first report of an omt with the ability to catalyze the o-methylation of four positions of hydroxyl groups in the a and c rings of flavonoids. however, there are some reports of sequential methylation of flavonoids by omts  <cit> . in particular, taomt <dig> from wheat exhibited definite sequential methylation of tricetin at its b-ring 3′-, 5′-, and 4′-hydroxyl groups. however, in the cdfomt <dig> reaction, not only 3-o-methylated quercetin but also azaleatin /rhamnetin  were obtained from quercetin, and this result indicates that cdfomt <dig> does not exhibit a sequential methylation order for 3-, 5-, and 7-hydroxyl groups of quercetin.fig.  <dig> hplc chromatograms of monohydroxy flavone products methylated by cdfomt5: s, substrate control; p, authentic compound of methylated product; and s + e, enzyme reaction product



nobiletin is a major pmf in c. depressa peel, and its 3′-, 4′-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-hydroxy groups are all methylated. therefore, cdfomt <dig> is hypothesized to play a significant role in the biosynthesis of pmf in c. depressa. there are many reports that a combination of several omts catalyze the o-methylation of flavonoids to produce pmfs  <cit> . furthermore, joe et al.  <cit>  reported that mutant omt  exhibits methylation activity for 3- and 7-hydroxy groups of flavonoids, whereas native pomt <dig> can methylate only the 7-hydroxy group  <cit> . they also showed that substitution of asp with gly at amino acid position  <dig> significantly affected the regioselectivity of pomt <dig>  although cdfomt <dig> contains asp <dig> corresponding to the asp <dig> of native pomt <dig>  cdfomt <dig> was able to catalyze the methylation reaction of flavonoids more widely than the mutated pomt <dig>  changes at a few amino acid residues of class ii o-methyltransferase also have substantial effects on substrate specificity, kinetic property, and regioselectivity . these findings indicate that size or shape of the catalytic center of cdfomt <dig> plays an important role in determining the broad regioselectivity of cdfomt <dig> 

substrate spectrum of cdfomt5
to investigate the substrate specificity of cdfomt <dig>  o-methyltransferase activities for naringenin, -epicatechin, equol, and cyanidin were measured . recombinant cdfomt <dig> exhibited omt activity for each of these substrates except cyanidin, although detailed structural determinations of the products have not yet been performed. however, we were not able to detect polymethylated products from naringenin, -epicatechin, and equol, even though cdfmot <dig> exhibited a broad regioselectivity toward quercetin and monohydroxylated flavone . the results suggested that cdfmot <dig> prefers flavonol  to other flavonoid structures. thus, substrate structure, especially the c-ring in flavonoids, may strongly affect the substrate preference, including regioselectivity, of cdfomt <dig> 

bioproduction of polymethylated quercetin with recombinant e. coli cells expressing cdfomt5
to examine the production of pmf by an e. coli biocatalyst expressing cdfomt <dig>  bioconversion was performed using quercetin as a substrate. in the presence of l-methionine and glucose for regenerating sam in the reaction mixture, many peaks corresponding to polymethylated quercetins were observed. this agreed with the results of enzymatic reactions of mono-hydroxyflavones. in contrast, negligible product amounts were obtained in the absence of methionine and glucose . this result clearly indicates that whole recombinant e. coli cells efficiently regenerated sam using l-methionine and glucose and that the methylation reaction was successfully carried out. additional peaks that were not expected in the enzymatic reaction were detected . lc-ms analysis showed that these extra products correspond to tri- and tetra-methylated quercetin . figure  <dig> shows that cdfomt <dig> catalyzes the methylation of the 3-, 5-, and 7-hydroxy groups of monohydroxylated flavones, although it does not catalyzes the 3′ or 4′-monohydroxyflavone . additionally, isorhamnetin  was a product of e. coli host cells that lacked cdfomt <dig> when used for bioconversion as a control . therefore, we surmised that an unexpected 3′-o-methylation reaction occurred in e. coli host cells. thus, the product corresponding to peak  <dig> was hypothesized to be  <dig> ′, <dig> -tetramethylated quercetin. to verify this, the product of peak  <dig> was purified and analyzed by h1-nmr. as shown in fig. 6c, four singlet peaks corresponding to the four methoxy groups were detected within a concentration range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  ppm. this strongly suggests that the product corresponding to peak  <dig> is  <dig> ′, <dig> -tetramethylated quercetin .fig.  <dig> bioproduction of polymethylated quercetin using recombinant e. coli carrying cdfomt <dig>  a the hplc analysis of the reaction mixture identified five peaks:  3-o-methylated quercetin;  isorhamnetin ;  azaleatin/tamarixetin;  dimethylated quercetin;  trimethylated quercetin; and   <dig> , <dig> ′-tetramethylated quercetin. peaks labeled with ‘x’ were not identified as quercetin derivatives. transformant cells harboring empty vector  was used as host cell. b mass spectrometry analysis of purified peak  <dig> product. c nmr spectrum of purified product . d predicted structure of  <dig> ′, <dig> -o-methylated quercetin



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we successfully obtained five fomt genes from c. depressa and expressed the cdfomt <dig> gene in e. coli cells. recombinant cdfomt <dig> demonstrated sam-dependent o-methyltransferase activity for quercetin, and its optimum ph and temperature were  <dig>  and 45 °c, respectively. cdfomt <dig> exhibited a broad range of not only substrate specificity, but also regioselectivity and catalyzed the methylation of 3-, 5-, 6-, and 7-hydroxyl groups of flavone. furthermore, quercetin was converted to  <dig> ′, <dig> -tetramethylated quercetin as a sequentially methylated product by the e. coli whole cell reaction system. thus, cdfomt <dig> is a useful o-methyltransferase possessing a wide range of regioselectivity for flavonoids and likely plays a role in the synthesis of nobiletin in c. depressa. further improvement of the host cell through metabolic engineering and the use of engineered cdfomt <dig> would make this bioprocess suitable for producing various pmfs.
