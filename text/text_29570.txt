BACKGROUND
upon the detection of pathogen, plants activate innate immune system to defend pathogen attack. receptor-like kinase  membrane proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors  and play essential roles in detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns . they initiates basal and broad-spectrum defense, known as pattern triggered immunity . rlks have been identified in many plant species and have been implicated in regulating the processes of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and/or abiotic stresses. most of the rlks identified as being involved in plant defense are of the lrr-rlk class including the rice xa <dig> protein and the arabidopsis flagellin sensitive  <dig>  and bacterial translation elongation factor ef-tu receptor . recent identification in rice of a lysine-motif  receptor kinase involved in the recognition of the fungal elicitor chitin  <cit>  and a lectin receptor kinase  involved disease resistance indicates that other rlk classes may also play important or overlapping roles in plant defense and pathogen recognition  <cit> . fls <dig> and efr act as prrs to detect pamps and trigger immune responses in a. thaliana. the chitin elicitor receptor kinase  <dig> of arabidopsis  directly binds chitin through its lysine motif -containing ectodomain to activate immune responses  <cit> . the rice gene xa <dig>  which codes for an lrr-rlk with  <dig> extracellular lrr repeats of  <dig> amino acids each and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain, confers race-specific resistance to xoo   <cit> . xa <dig> is developmentally controlled: juvenile rice plants challenged with xoo are less resistant than older plants  <cit> . xa3/xa <dig> also encodes an lrr-rlk, but does not appear to be developmentally regulated, as both juvenile and adult plants exhibit resistance against xoo  <cit> . the tomato resistance gene cf, which encodes a protein containing extracellular lrr domains but lack the cytoplasmic protein kinase domain, also confer a race-specific resistance to cladosprium fulvum  <cit> . up to now, only a few rlks have been functionally identified, which is even more so in common wheat .

wheat powdery mildew, caused by a biotrophic fungus blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici  is one of the most serious diseases of common wheat. breeding and utilizing wheat varieties with powdery mildew resistance are widely-accepted strategies for the disease control. to date, among the  <dig> identified powdery mildew resistance genes  <cit> , only pm <dig> together with its multiple alleles, pm <dig>  pm <dig> and a key member of pm <dig> have been cloned  <cit> . pm <dig> is located on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1a  <cit>  and  <dig> functional alleles have been identified at this locus . further results reveal that the pm <dig> alleles confer race-specific resistance to different subsets of bgt races  <cit> . recent research show that the rye pm <dig> is an ortholog of pm <dig>  which suppresses the pm8-mediated powdery mildew resistance in lines containing pm <dig>  <cit> . the pm <dig> gene is located on the chromosome 6vs of haynaldia villosa, which is a diploid wheat relative. cao et al. reported that a key member of pm <dig> encoding a putative serine and threonine protein kinase conferred broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew in wheat  <cit> .

a series of triticum aestivum c.v. prins- triticum timopheevii  introgression lines with different introgressed 2g chromosome fragment sizes have been developed and characterized . the powdery mildew resistance gene pm <dig>  whose effects depend on developmental stages, is located on the long arm of chromosome 2g. the developed introgression lines all show powdery mildew resistance, especially at their adult stages, and have been widely used in wheat breeding programs. however, the genetic mechanism for powdery mildew resistance of these introgression lines is still not clear. in the present study, two members from the lrr-rlk cluster were cloned from t. aestivum c.v. prins- t. timopheevii introgression line igv1- <dig>  the two genes both exhibit a developmentally dependent expression manner in response to bgt infection. their transient and stable transformation improved the powdery mildew resistance of the susceptible wheat variety yangmai  <dig>  while knockdown of the genes by transient gene silencing compromised the resistance level of the resistant lines, suggesting that both genes are involved in powdery mildew resistance in wheat.

methods
plant materials
the powdery mildew susceptible swedish common wheat variety prins, powdery mildew resistant t. timopheevii, and nine t. aestivum -t. timopheevii introgression lines  were kindly provided by dr. j. mackey, swedish agricultural university, uppsala, sweden. the sizes of introgressed 2g fragments in the above nine introgression lines have been characterized using molecular markers  <cit> . three “chinese spring”  nulli-tetrasomic lines for homoeologous group  <dig> were introduced from wheat genetics and genomics resources center , kansas state university, usa, and used to determine the chromosome location of tarlk1/ <dig> genes. igv1- <dig> and prins were used for gene cloning of tarlk1/ <dig> and its homologs, and for single-cell transient over-expression and gene-silencing, respectively. common wheat variety yangmai  <dig>  which is moderately susceptible to powdery mildew, was used as the receptor of genetic transformation. a highly powdery mildew susceptible wheat variety, sumai  <dig>  was used for the production of fresh bgt inoculums.

bgt isolates and inoculation
the naturally occurring bgt population was collected from the field in nanjing , jiangsu province, china, which was permitted for research. the inoculums were increased on sumai  <dig> plants under a spore-proof greenhouse conditions prior to setting up the disease evaluation experiment. inoculation was accomplished by gently shaking conidia from leaves of infected sumai  <dig> plants, which was grown at 20 °c with 16 h daylight and 80 % relative humidity  <cit> , onto the foliage of the tested lines.

rapid amplified cdna end 
the smarttm race cdna amplification kit  was used to clone the full-length cdna of different members of the lrr-rlk gene family from the cdna mixture of igv1- <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours after inoculation  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. primers for 5’-race  and 3’-race  are described in additional file 1: table s <dig>  two pairs of primers  were designed based on the sequence of the 5’and 3’cdna ends and used to obtain the full length cdna of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> . the pcr products were cloned into the pgem-t easy vector  and sequenced by bgi .

sequence analysis, domain prediction, and phylogenetic analysis
signal peptide, transmembrane and kinase domains were predicted using the smart software   <cit> . the atp binding site, ser/thr kinase active site and twin arginine translocation  signal domain were predicted by the scanprosite software .

phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the full length amino acid sequences of tarlk <dig>  tarlk <dig>  and other lrr-rlks. full length of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> were used as query sequences to identify their orthologs by the blastp in the phytozome proteome database . phylogenetic analysis was performed using mega  <dig> based on the neighbor-joining method and a bootstrap test of  <dig> replicates  <cit> .

marker analysis
genomic dna was extracted from young leaves as previously described  <cit> , and the detail sequence information of the primer pairs was listed in qin et al.  <cit> . pcr was performed following the procedure of ji et al.  <cit>  and the pcr products were separated on 8 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels  at room temperature with 1 × tbe buffer and visualized by silver staining  <cit> .

expression analysis of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> by quantitative real time-pcr 
for bgt treatments, the prins and igv1- <dig> were grown in a chamber for 16/8 h light/dark at 25/20 °c and then inoculated with bgt spores onto the leaf surface at the second and fourth leaf stages. for chemical treatments, the seedlings of igv1- <dig> at the first leaf stage were sprayed with 5 mm salicylic acid , 100 μm methyl jasmonate , 100 μm abscisic acid , or 7 mm hydrogen peroxide  in  <dig>  % ethanol solution, and with  <dig>  % ethanol used as control. for the expression of transgenic lines, the yangmai  <dig> and transgenic lines were grown in a chamber for 16/8 h light/dark at 25/20 °c. the leaves of each sample were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c. total rna was extracted using the trizol reagent , and dnase i was used to remove the dna before reverse transcription. the reverse transcript reaction was performed using amv reverse transcriptase  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

qrt-pcr was performed to analyze the expression of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> using sybr green i master mix  in a volume of 25 μl, and the 18s rrna was used as a reference. the qrt-pcr reaction was performed using the abi prism  <dig> system . the program used was as follows: 94 °c for 1 min; followed by 40 cycles of 94 °c for 5 s, 65 °c for 15 s and 72 °c for 30 s. the relative transcript level of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> was calculated using the 2–ΔΔct method  <cit> . the sequence information of the primers  used are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

construction of pbi220:tarlk and pwmb006:tarlk vectors
the orf of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig>  amplified by primer pair lrr-rlk-orf-f and lrr-rlk-orf-r, were inserted into the expression vector pbi <dig> under the control of the camv35s promoter, respectively. the recombinant vectors pbi220:tarlk <dig> and pbi220:tarlk <dig> were used for single-cell transient over-expression assay and genetic transformation.

the binary vector pwmb <dig> , which is under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter ubi, was used as an intermediate vector for rnai vector construction  <cit> . the common 259 bp-fragment to both tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig>  amplified by primer pair lrr-rlk-rnai-f and lrr-rlk-rnai-r , was digested with the restrictive enzymes spei and saci and then inserted into the spei-saci site in sense orientation. the fragment amplified with the same above primer pair was digested by the restrictive enzymes bamhi and kpni and then ligated into the bamhi-kpni site in antisense orientation. accordingly, the hairpin rnai vector pwmb006:tarlk was obtained and used for single-cell transient gene-silencing assay. the linker between the two reverse fragments is a 478 bp intron from rice.

single-cell transient over-expression and gene-silencing assays
the single-cell transient over-expression and gene silencing assays were performed according to shirasu et al.  <cit>  and douchkov et al.  <cit> , respectively. in brief, primary leaf segments of seven-day-old wheat seedlings were transformed by tungsten particles coated with a mixture of pahc <dig>  <cit>  containing the gus gene and the recombinant vectors pbi220:tarlk <dig> or pbi220:tarlk <dig>  the bombarded wheat leaves were transferred to 1 % agar plates supplemented with 85 μm benzimidazole and incubated at 18 °c for 6 h before high density inoculation with bgt spores. when rnai vectors containing pwmb006:tarlk were transformed, the bombardment leaf segments were incubated for 72 h before the inoculation with bgt mixed isolates. the leaves were stained with gus to observe the epidermal cells and haustorium-containing transformed cells infected by bgt spores at  <dig> hai. the haustorium index  was presented as the mean of three or four independent replicated experiments. each replicate included examination of 50− <dig> successful gus-expressing cells upon inoculation with bgt conidia.

genetic transformation
the moderate susceptible wheat variety yangmai  <dig> was used as the receptor to generate the transgenic wheat. the expression plasmid pbi220:tarlk <dig> or pbi220:tarlk <dig> was co-bombarded with the plasmid pahc <dig> into the callus from the immature embryo of yangmai  <dig>  gene gun bombardment of embryos, selection, and regeneration were carried out as described by xing et al.  <cit> .

the genomic dna of the regenerated t <dig> plants was isolated and used for pcr analysis using the primer pair 35s-f and lrr-rlk-r  to identify the positive transgenic plants. semi qrt-pcr  was performed with 30 cycles  to compare the expression of the target genes in the untransformed control and the transgenic wheat. the sequence information of the primers  is listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

evaluation of powdery mildew resistance
powdery mildew resistance of the transgenic line and yangmai  <dig> was evaluated by artificial bgt inoculation as described below.

for seedling stage resistance, the detached leaf segments of t <dig> transgenic plants and the control were maintained on the culture medium  in a petridish, inoculated with bgt isolates for 5− <dig> days under pathogen-free environment, and the infection types  were scored as grades  <dig> to  <dig>  in which, it 0- <dig> were resistant, and it ≥  <dig> were susceptible. the final results were the average of three independent experiments.

for adult stage resistance, at 6− <dig> days after bgt inoculation of the t <dig> transgenic plants and the control in the greenhouse, their its were scored as grades  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , in which it 0- <dig> was resistant, while it >  <dig> was susceptible. all the plants were scored twice.

histochemical staining using  <dig>  3’-diaminobenzidine 
in vivo h2o <dig> production in plants was detected by an endogenous peroxidase-dependent in situ histochemical staining procedure using dab   <cit> . the first detached leaves from 7-day-old seedlings after bgt infection were stained with 1 mg/ml dab dissolved in naoh-acidified  distilled water overnight, then discolored in boiling 95 % ethanol for 10 min, stored in 50 % glycerol. representative phenotypes were captured with an olympus microscope .

measurements of h2o <dig> production and antioxidant enzyme activities
the h2o <dig> content was measured according to bellincampi et al.  <cit> . briefly, an aliquot of supernatant  was added to 500 μl assay reagent . after 45 min of incubation, the peroxide-mediated oxidation of fe2+ to fe3+ was determined by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm of the fe3+-xylenol orange complex.

super oxide dismutase  and catalase  enzyme activities were analyzed following the method described by zhang et al.  <cit> . total sod activity was measured based on its ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium  by the superoxide anion generated by the riboflavin system under illumination. one unit of sod  was defined as the amount of crude enzyme extract required to inhibit the reduction rate of nbt by 50 %. determination of guaiacol peroxidases  enzyme activity was carried out by measuring the oxidation of guaiacol extinction coefficient. cat activity was spectro-photometrically measured by monitoring the consumption of h2o <dig>  at 240 nm for at least 3 min.

statistical analysis
all data obtained were subjected to anova, and the mean difference was compared by the lsd test at 95 % or 99 % levels of probability. in all figures, the spread of values is shown as error bars representing standard errors of the means.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of tarlk <dig> and tarlk2
previous study suggested that a cluster of lrr-rlk genes located in the long arm of chromosome 2b of t. aestivum -t. timopheevii introgression line igv1- <dig>  in the synthetic regions of rice and b. distachyon, the cluster is conservely present and each has five and two lrr-rlk gene members, respectively  <cit> . based on sequence of one of the two rlk gene members in b. distachyon , two specific nest primer pairs  were designed and used for 5’ race  and 3’ race  using cdna of igv1- <dig>  the 5’- and 3’- end sequences of the lrr-rlk gene were obtained . according to the predicted open reading frame  of the obtained expressed sequence of a putative lrr-rlk, two primer pairs  were further designed and used to clone the full-length cdna. two members of the lrr-rlk gene family, namely tarlk <dig>  and tarlk <dig>  were obtained from igv1- <dig>  both containing an orf of  <dig> nucleotides encoding a 1014-amino-acid peptide.

pair wise comparison showed that tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> share  <dig>  % identity and are only different in seven amino acids, i.e. v7a, v21a, d23h, p56l, t82s, s433p and l672r . the smart software  <cit>  predicted that both lrr-rlks contain a putative signal peptide domain at the n-terminal region , a putative extra-cellular domain  with  <dig> tandem copies of a 24-amino acid lrr; a putative trans-membrane domain  and a putative ser/thr protein kinase domain at the c-terminal region  . each unit of the lrr domain has the lxxlxxlxxlxlxxnxlxgxlpxx consensus, in which x represents any amino acid. based on the structural properties predicted by the scanprosite, both lrr-rlks consist of an atp binding site  and a ser/thr kinase active site  in their protein kinase catalytic domains. as expected, several highly conserved motifs, val-ala-val-lys , his-arg-asp , or asp-phe-gly  exist in the c-terminal arg-asp  kinase domains for both lrr-rlks  <cit> . the lrr domain of both lrr-rlks contains  <dig> glycosylation sites . the n-terminal region of tarlk <dig> contains a putative tat  signal domain, which is absent in the tarlk <dig> .fig.  <dig> the deduced amino acid sequences of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> proteins. red characters represent seven amino acid differences. the open boxed region represents the n-terminal region of tarlk <dig> which comprises a putative twin arginine translocation  signal domain. characters in the green brackets represent conserved pairs of cysteines spaced by six or seven amino acids. roman numerals mark the  <dig> tandem copies of a 24-amino acid lrr. blue characters represent nine glycosylation sites . green characters represent a putative protein kinase catalytic domain with atp binding site. black arrow heads indicate a ser/thr kinase active site . characters underlined as red represent the conserved motifs  in the rd kinases. sp: signal peptide domain; lrr: leucine-rich repeat domain; tm: transmembrane domain, pk: ser/thr protein kinase domain



blastp was performed against the phytozome proteome database for identifying the tarlk1/ <dig> orthologs based on the similarity of full-length amino acid sequence. tarlk1/ <dig> orthologs were identified from  <dig> plant species with available genome information. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two tarlks and their orthologs from different gramineae species are in the same branches. both tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> are highly homologous to bradi5g <dig> , os04g <dig>  os04g <dig> , os04g <dig> , os04g <dig> , os04g <dig> , grmzm2g126858_t <dig>  si009240m, and sb06g <dig> , indicating lrr-rlk orthologs are highly conserved .

physical localization of tarlk1/2
in the scaffold  <dig> from chromosome 2d of the released aegilop tauschii  genome sequence  <cit> , a tarlks homolog  having highest sequence similarity, were identified. a primer pair  were designed and used for determine the chromosome location of tarlks from igv1- <dig>  nau-2 f/r amplified three common amplicons  in prins and igv1- <dig>  a 450 bp amplicon was only present in t. timopheevii and four introgression lines igv1- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . six molecular markers previously mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2b  <cit>  together with nau-2 f/r were used for amplification in nine t. aestivum-t. timopheevii introgression lines. based on the presence and absence of the specific amplicons for chromosome 2g, the tarlk1/ <dig> could be mapped to the same chromosome region as markers cinau <dig> and cinau <dig>  while not as markers cinau <dig> and cinau <dig>  in which the pm <dig> is located .fig.  <dig> physical localization of tarlk1/ <dig>  pcr was conducted using specific primer pair nau-2 f and nau-2r differentiating tarlk1/ <dig> on bb subgenome and its homologue genes on aa, dd and gg subgenome . the arrows point the amplified bands on 2a, 2b, 2d and 2g. tarlk1/ <dig> homologue gene on gg subgenome was physically mapped to the same chromosome region as reported markers cinau <dig> and cinau <dig>  using a set of introgression lines from t. timopheevii.. in fig. 2b, the arrows point the specific bands from gg subgenome. in fig. 2c, white boxes indicate the chromosome from prins bb subgenome and black boxes indicate introgression fragments from t. timopheevii gg subgenome. white ovals indicate centromere region. letter s, l and cen represent chromosome short arm, long arm and centromere. at the bottom, pm means powdery mildew responses, resistance  or susceptibility 



compared with the released sequence of triticum urartu   <cit> , the tarlk <dig> is from the 2a, and the tarlk <dig> is from 2b. by pcr-based homologous cloning,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> full length sequences of tarlks were obtained from bgt resistant igv1- <dig> and t. timopheevii as well as the bgt susceptible wheat variety prins. multiple sequence alignment with tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> identified  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms  . based on the distribution of the  <dig> snps, the tarlks can be classified into four different types, with the tarlk <dig> and tirlk were two original types. the tarlk <dig> is presumed to be originated from a recombination between tarlk <dig> and tirlk at the region between 396-459 bp, and tarlkprins is presumed to be originated from a recombination between tarlk <dig> and tirlk, but at a different region  .table  <dig> snps in the tarlk genes from powdery mildew resistant igvi- <dig>  t. timopheevii and powdery mildew susceptible prins

the gene expression patterns for tarlk1/tarlk <dig> at two leaf stages and by bgt infection
t. aestivum-t. timopheevii introgression lines show high powdery mildew resistance only after the fourth leaf stage  <cit> . the igv1- <dig> is susceptible at the first leaf stage but has a higher resistance level starting from the fourth leaf stage   <cit> .

the expression profiles of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> in the resistant line igv1- <dig> and susceptible prins were analyzed by qrt-pcr. in igv1- <dig>  the expression level of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> at the fourth leaf stage is  <dig>  times higher than that at the second leaf stage. whereas, in prins, expression levels are similar for all tested time points, and remain at relatively low levels both at the second- and fourth-leaf stages . the gene expression patterns of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> in igv1- <dig> are consistent with the development-dependent resistance phenotype. further comparison of the expression of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> in igv1- <dig> and prins upon bgt inoculation at the second and fourth leaf stages showed that, tarlk1/tarlk <dig> was slightly up-regulated in both genotypes  at the second leaf stage . however, their expression levels were significantly up-regulated in igv1- <dig>  than those in prins  at the fourth leaf stage when challenged with bgt infection . above results indicated that the expression of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> was development-dependent.fig.  <dig> gene expression profiling of tarlks in prins and igv1- <dig>  tarlks expression in prins and igv1- <dig> at the second and fourth leaf stages without bgt inoculation , and response to bgt infection at the second  and fourth  leaf growing stages, respectively. “*” indicates significant differences across different time point within each genotype at  <dig>  levels, using 2nd leaf stage  and non-inoculated sample  as control. h: hours after bgt inoculation. data were from three independently replicated experiments with similar result



powdery mildew resistance evaluation of tarlks by transient over-expression or silencing assays
a single-cell transient over-expression assay, which has been successfully used to elucidate gene function in resistance against bgt infection  <cit> , was used to elucidate the above assumption. the epidermal cells expressing reporter gene gus and undergoing attacks by germinating bgt spores were selected to observe the haustorium formation and calculate the haustorium index . the interaction between the host and bgt is considered compatible when haustorium and elongating secondary hyphae are formed . when bgt fail to penetrate into the cells and no haustorium formed, the interaction is considered incompatible . our analyses revealed that, compared with the  <dig>  % hi in prins transformed with pahc <dig> only, transient over-expression of tarlk <dig> or tarlk <dig> in leaves of prins by co-transformation of pbi220:tarlk <dig> or pbi220:tarlk <dig> with pahc <dig> significantly decreased the hi to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively.fig.  <dig> the interaction of leaf epidermal cells challenged with bgt and the statistics of haustorium index  after single-cell transient over-expression assay. representative of compatible  and incompatible interaction  wheat leaf epidermal cells challenged with bgt, the haustorium index  of bgt after single-cell transient expression of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> in the epidermal cells in prins  and after transient induced gene silencing of tarlk1/ <dig> in igv1- <dig>  co: conidia; ha: haustorium; hy: hyphae. scale bars = 50 μm. different letters indicate the significant difference at  <dig>  levels. data were from three independent replicated experiments



the hi in the bgt resistant line igv1- <dig> transformed with pahc <dig> empty vector was  <dig>  % . whereas, when tarlks were transiently silenced in igv1- <dig>  the hi was significantly increased to  <dig>  % . these results indicate that the tarlks positively regulates the powdery mildew resistance by suppressing bgt haustorium formation.

the function analysis of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> in resistance to powdery mildew in transgenic lines
subsequently, the pbi220:tarlk <dig> and pbi220:tarlk <dig> were each co-transformed with pahc <dig>  into the callus of yangmai  <dig> by genegun bombardment. after three rounds of herbicide bialaphos selection, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> regenerated plants were obtained from  <dig>  and  <dig>  immature embryo callus transformed tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig>  respectively. pcr analysis using the combination primer pair camv35s-f and lrr-rlk-r identified  <dig> and  <dig> transgene-positive plants, respectively . the regeneration frequencies were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , and the frequencies of transgene-positive plants were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  for genes tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig>  respectively. qrt-pcr analysis of part of the selected positive plants verified that the expression levels of tarlk <dig> or tarlk <dig> were higher in the transgenic plants than those in the receptor yangmai  <dig> and the negative regenerated plant tarlk2- <dig> .fig.  <dig> the molecular identification of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> transgenic plants and powdery mildew resistance evaluation. using specific primer pair, we performed pcr to identify tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> t <dig> positive transgenic plants  and qrt-pcr to study the gene expression level of tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> in t <dig> positive transgenic plants, “*” indicates significant differences at  <dig>  levels, compared with yangmai  <dig>  powdery mildew resistance evaluation for tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> t <dig> transgenic plants at seedling and adult leaf stage were conducted, using susceptible yangmai  <dig> as control . the hyphae growing on the surface of leaves from transgenic lines for tarlk <dig> gene at seedling growing stage  and transgenic lines for tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> at adult growing stage  were observed, using susceptible yangmai  <dig> as control



the powdery mildew resistance of transgenic plants at t <dig> generation against bgt mixture isolates was evaluated at both seedling and adult stages. at seedling stage, for example, the infection types  of three transgenic plants over-expressing tarlk <dig>  were all grade 1; the its of three transgenic plants over-expressing tarlk <dig>  were all grade  <dig>  whereas, the it of non-transformed yangmai  <dig> was grade  <dig> , indicating that the over-expression of tarlk <dig> or tarlk <dig> enhanced the powdery mildew resistance of yangmai  <dig>  compared to that in yangmai  <dig>  three resistant transgenic plants of tarlk <dig> had fewer germinated conidia, developed hyphae and conidiophores on their leaves . at adult stage, all the above six transgenic plants showed improved powdery mildew resistance , compared to yangmai  <dig>  . these indicate that both tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> confer powdery mildew resistance in wheat, and tarlk <dig> gene has superior effect at seedling stage.

the involvement of sa and ros homeostasis in the powdery mildew resistance conferred by tarlk <dig> and tarlk2
salicylic acid , jasmonate  and hydrogen peroxide  are signaling molecules that regulate complex defense responses by inducing pathogenesis related  genes  <cit> . the induction of ros potentiates the programmed cell death . effective defense against biotrophic pathogens is mainly due to pcd in the host, and to associated activation of defense responses regulated by the sa-dependent pathway  <cit> .

to elucidate the mechanism of powdery mildew resistance conferred by tarlk1/tarlk <dig>  the first or second leaves from 2-week-old plants of prins, igv1- <dig>  yangmai  <dig> and the tarlk1/tarlk <dig> transgenic plants at the t <dig> generation were dab-stained to investigate h2o <dig> accumulation upon bgt infection. at  <dig> hai, no oxidative production was observed in the leaves of any tested samples . at  <dig> hai, igv1- <dig> exhibited higher ros level than in prins. the resistant transgenic lines tarlk1- <dig> and tarlk2- <dig> also showed more ros than yangmai  <dig> . at most of the bgt interaction sites, no oxidative production was detected in prins and yangmai  <dig> . however, in tarlk1- <dig>  tarlk2- <dig>  and igv1- <dig>  massive h2o <dig> accumulation was observed at either the bgt interaction sites  or in the whole cells . time course tests of endogenous h2o <dig> levels showed that, at both seedling and adult stages, there was a fast endogenous h2o <dig> production in the two positive transgenic lines , igv1- <dig> , igv1- <dig>  and t. timopheevii  upon bgt infection. no significant change was observed in the susceptible lines , such as yangmai  <dig>  prins and another negative transgenic plant tarlk2- <dig> which was an alternative of tarlk2- <dig>  these suggested that ros pathway participated in the powdery mildew resistance conferred by tarlks.fig.  <dig> h2o <dig> accumulation in the leaves and endogenous h2o <dig> contents in different materials. microscope observation of h2o <dig> accumulation in wheat leaves of prins, yangmai  <dig>  igv1- <dig> and the transgenic lines at  <dig> and  <dig> hai of bgt  and endogenous h2o <dig> contents of wheat at second  and fourth  leaf stages after bgt treatments. b was the representative image at bgt interaction sites in susceptible genotypes. c and d were the representative images at bgt interaction sites in resistant genotypes. h2o <dig> was detected at bgt interaction sites in leave epidermal cells of resistant igv1- <dig> and transgenic lines , while not obvious in those of susceptible prins and yangmai  <dig> . “*” indicates significant differences across different time point within each genotype at  <dig>  levels, using non-inoculated sample as control. h: hours after bgt inoculation. results are replicated in three independent experiments of similar result



the activities of enzymes responsible for h2o <dig> production and ros scavenging were further tested. in response to bgt inoculation, the h2o <dig> producing sod enzyme activities significantly increased in the powdery mildew resistant materials, although different genotypes showed different patterns. at the second leaf stage, the sod activities in the transgenic lines of both tarlks increased and reached the peak at  <dig> hai, while at the fourth leaf stage, significant increase advanced to  <dig> hai. in igv1- <dig> and igv1- <dig>  the sod activity increase was observed at  <dig> hai at the second leaf stage; however, no significant change was observed at the fourth leaf stage. in t. timopheevii, a significant increase of sod activity was only observed at the fourth leaf stage. however, both yangmai  <dig> and the negative transgenic line tarlk2- <dig> showed significant decrease of sod activities at  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai, respectively .

in response to bgt inoculation at two developmental stages, the activities of ros scavenging enzymes cat and pod increased significantly in all the resistant materials, but decreased in yangmai  <dig> and prins. in the transgenic lines of both tarlks, the increased pod activity occurred at  <dig> hai at the second leaf stage, and advanced to  <dig> hai at the fourth leaf stage; the increase of cat activity occurred at  <dig> hai and  <dig> hai at the second leaf stages respectively in tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig>  but advanced to  <dig> hai at the fourth leaf stage. in t. timopheevii, the pod activity increase occurred earlier than cat . the distinct difference of ros production and scavenging enzymes in the resistant and susceptible materials at different developmental stages further support the importance of ros in powdery mildew resistance mediated by the two tarlks.

gene expression patterns for tarlk1/ <dig> in prins and igv1- <dig> when treated with sa, meja, aba and h2o <dig> were compared. in igv1- <dig>  tarlk1/tarlk <dig> was moderately up-regulated by meja , aba  and h2o <dig> , and was dramatically induced by sa  at  <dig> hai. while in prins, no increased expression was detected, except when treated with h2o <dig>  a delayed induction at  <dig> hai was observed . we also found that the expression of tapr <dig>  tapr <dig> and tapr <dig>  three marker genes of sa signaling pathway, was constitutively expressed at the seedling stage without bgt inoculation in the transgenic lines over-expressing tarlks. the expression of cat, scavenger of ros, was up-expressed in tarlk1/tarlk <dig> transgenic lines without bgt inoculation . these indicate multiple signal pathways may influence the resistance conferred by tarlk1/tarlk <dig> in wheat.fig.  <dig> gene expression patterns for tarlk1/ <dig> in response to the treatments of exogenous phytohormones meja , sa , aba  and signal molecule h2o <dig>  in prins and ivg1- <dig>  “*” indicates significant differences across different time point within each genotype at  <dig>  levels, using non-inoculated sample as control. h: hours after treatment. n/a: data missing



discussion
plant lrr-rlks, for example, arabidopsis fls <dig> and rice xa <dig>  were found to be involved in plant immune responses to the microbe attacks  <cit> . both tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> contain signal peptide, lrr, tm, s/tpk domain, and several n-glycosylation sites, which have also been identified in the lrr-containing ectodomain of cell-surface receptors that can recognize mamps to activate pti response in both animals and plants . arabidopsis defense-associated lrr-rlks, such as brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <cit> , flg22-induced receptor-like kinase  <dig>   <cit> , and the peptide  <dig> and peptide  <dig> receptors  <cit> , are all rd kinases. similar to arabidopsis rkf <dig>  which is responsible for triggering a cascade of intracellular events during defense responses  <cit> , tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> containing the n-glycosylation sites and rd motif belong to the viii- <dig> subfamily due to their high homology to bradi5g <dig> , which is a member of the viii- <dig> subfamily in brachypodium .

both genes contributed to powdery mildew resistance, but showed distinct resistance level. the transgenic plants over-expressing tarlk <dig> were moderately resistant at seedling stage, and highly resistant at adult stage, while transgenic plants for tarlk <dig> exhibited high resistance at both stages, implying that both tarlks contributed to the defense response to bgt infection, and tarlk <dig> had larger effects than tarlk <dig>  the tat domain of lrr-rlks was reported to function in transporting folded proteins across energy-transducing membranes  <cit> . therefore, we assume that differential resistance may be due to their sequence differentiation at the tat signal domain and spacer region of same gene family, which driven by co-evolution with the pathogen. the two genes had different resistance spectrums, so their different resistance levels to bgt mixture may also be due to the composition of the bgt isolates.

many disease resistance genes belong to multi-gene families, indicating that gene duplication and subsequent diversification are common for gene evolution in plant  <cit> . recombination at the disease resistance loci, such as the disease resistance gene rp <dig> in maize and wheat stem rust resistance gene sr <dig> has been proven to be associated with the creation of novel resistance phenotypes  <cit>  and contribute to the diversification of plant gene families. our results suggest a model for the evolution of the tarlk gene family. duplication and subsequent divergence of a progenitor tarlk gene led to the emergence of tarlk multi-gene families. the tarlk <dig> and tarlkprins were originated from the types of sequence recombination between tarlk <dig> and tirlk <dig>  the association of the gene structure with their function diversification will be further elucidated.

pm <dig> was introgressed from t. timopheevii into common wheat  <cit> . pm <dig> mediated powdery mildew resistance showed a developmentally-dependence, and has been widely used in wheat breeding programs. igv1- <dig> show high resistance to the local bgt population, starting from the fourth leaf stage  <cit> . in this paper, we observed that the expression of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> in igv1- <dig> at the fourth leaf stage was higher than that at the second leaf stage . over-expression of tarlk <dig> in yangmai  <dig> via stable transformation resulted in moderately higher powdery mildew resistance at both seedling and adult stages, and over-expression of tarlk <dig> in yangmai  <dig> significantly enhanced resistance at both stages . according to these findings, we infer that both tarlks were regulated at two different stages. pm <dig> was previously mapped on chromosome 2bl within the fraction length   <dig> - <dig>  , flanked by two sts markers, nau/stsbcd135- <dig> and nau/stsbcd135- <dig>  with a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . in the present study the tarlk1/tarlk <dig> was mapped to homeologous group  <dig> chromosomes of t. aestivum . however, we found that the specific amplicon for tarlk1/tarlk <dig> from the gg genome was only present in igv1- <dig> and not in igv1- <dig> . igv1- <dig> has the smallest introgression fragment of 2g, while igv1- <dig> has the largest  <cit> . the absence of the 2g specific amplicon  reveal that tarlk1/tarlk <dig> were not located in the 2g chromosome introgression fragment in igv1- <dig>  however, they have clear function in powdery mildew resistance in wheat, and we speculated that tarlks are new powdery mildew resistance genes neighboring with the pm <dig> 

we observed that when challenged with bgt, plants over-expressing tarlk1/ <dig> showed enhanced h2o <dig> accumulation at as early as  <dig> hai . the sod, pod and cat activities increased significantly in resistant lines , as well as tarlk1/ <dig> over-expressing plants, mostly at  <dig> hai upon bgt inoculation , suggesting that the increased h2o <dig> production could in turn trigger the activity of ros-scavenging enzymes, to maintain the appropriate levels of endogenous ros. ros, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, are produced at all levels in resistance reactions in plants. in basal resistance, they are linked to papilla formation and the assembly of barriers. in the r gene mediated defense, they may be linked to pcd, and resulted in systemic acquired resistance . they interact with sa in signaling, which is the typical pathway against a biotroph pathogen in arabidopsis  <cit> . at least two distinct enzymes, pod and cat, contribute to the removal of ros  <cit> . the hr is accompanied by a localized increase in the accumulation of ros and is further characterized by rapid pcd at sites of infection  <cit> . our data affirmed the association of tarlk1/ <dig> mediated powdery mildew resistance with the ros homeostasis, which has been proven to be responsible for triggering defense response in plants  <cit> .

the expression of tarlk1/tarlk <dig> was up-regulated significantly by sa. moreover, the marker genes of the sa signaling pathway, tapr <dig> and tapr <dig>  were all constitutively up-regulated at the seedling stage without bgt inoculation in the positive t <dig> transgenic plants over-expressing tarlk <dig> or tarlk <dig> , indicating that both genes were involved in the sa-mediated defense pathway against bgt. this implies the predominant role of the sa pathway in the tarlk <dig> or tarlk <dig> mediated powdery mildew resistance. the marker gene of eth pathway, pr <dig>  was also significantly up-regulated in the transgenic plants, indicating the possible involvement of eth signaling pathway in the tarlk <dig> or tarlk2- mediated powdery mildew resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we cloned two members of tarlk family, named tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig>  from t. aestivum c.v. prins-t. timopheevii introgression line igv1- <dig>  the two genes are present as a gene cluster on the long arm of chromosome 2b, and both tarlk <dig> and tarlk <dig> confer powdery mildew resistance, which was proved by single-cell transient over-expression, gene-silencing assays and stable genetic transformation. sa and altered ros homeostasis are involved in defense responses of the transgenic wheat to bgt infection.
