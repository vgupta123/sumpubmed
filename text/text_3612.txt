BACKGROUND
in order to improve fruit quality, it is important not only to take into account the quality of the fruit when it is harvested from the tree, but also post-harvest quality. after harvesting, fruits are packed and shipped to local and foreign markets. they remain on the shelf at supermarkets and/or farmers markets until the consumer purchases the fruits and finally consumes it. for this reason, the effects that shipping and storage have on fruit quality are very important. one of the most common methods to increase the post-harvest life of fruits is to store them in refrigeration, so that ripening is inhibited. however, prolonged cold storage of fruits such as peaches and nectarines can trigger a physiological disorder known as chilling injury or internal breakdown, which negatively affects fruit quality  <cit> .

one of the most important problems associated with chilling injury is mealiness/woolliness. after prolonged cold storage, fruits produce a woolly phenotype when ripened. woolly fruits lack juice and have a mealy texture, making them inedible and undesirable to consumers. this, in turn, leads to large economical losses for the fruit industry  <cit> . chilling injuries such as wooliness are especially problematic for major counter-season fruit exporters such as chile  <cit> . a better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes that lead to ripening, as well as woolliness, may provide future strategies to increase the shelf-life while minimizing the negative effects of cold-storage on fruit quality  <cit> .

wooliness occurs when fruits, stored between 0-8°c for prolonged periods of time, are transferred to conditions in which fruit ripening may occur. under normal conditions, peach fruit ripening has been associated with changes in the expression of genes that code for cell wall degradation enzymes and the subsequent changes in enzymatic activity  <cit> . various studies have provided correlative evidence that wooliness is associated with an imbalance between the activity of the cell wall-degrading enzymes, polygalacturonase  and pectin methylesterase   <cit> . additionally, by using macroarray analyses to compare the transcripts present in juicy fruits with those from wooliness, we have previously identified a number of genes that are differentially expressed in these fruits  <cit> . ogundiwin et al, have also identified genes that are differentially expressed between juicy and woolly fruits using microarray analyses  <cit> .

however, the susceptibility of peaches and nectarines to become woolly after prolonged cold-storage has been associated with particular peach and nectarine cultivars  <cit> , as well as seasonal variation  <cit> . cultivar specificity and seasonal variation suggest that multiple factors participate in developing a woolly phenotype in peach fruits  <cit> . therefore, it is important to analyze not only the final end product , but also the multiple factors that may be causing wooliness.

to identify the molecular mechanisms associated with developing wooliness, we have taken a global approach towards identifying genes that are differentially expressed in response to factors such as cold, ripening, or the combined effects of these two factors , the latter of which results in the woolly peach phenotype.

we sequenced and statistically analyzed the abundance of expressed sequence tags  from peaches at four different post-harvest conditions, mimicking the stages of cold storage for fruit exportation. this statistical analysis has enabled us to identify target genes whose expression is affected by post-harvest factors such as long-term cold storage, ripening or the combined effects of these two factors. these analyses also reveal the different biological processes that are occurring under each post-harvest condition and the differences between these conditions. additionally, we have generated a collection of full-length cdna clones flanked by two loxp sites which may be useful in confirming the functionality of these gene products and the future annotation of the peach genome.

RESULTS
in order to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to factors such as long-term cold storage , genes that are differentially expressed during ripening , as well as the combined effects of these two factors , a  <dig> ×  <dig> factorial design was used to generate four cdna libraries that can be used for statistical comparative analyses  <cit> .

these libraries represent the mesocarp tissue of o'henry peaches  under the following four distinct post-harvest conditions:

e <dig> = non-ripe; no long-term cold storage = r-, c-

e <dig> = ripe; no long-term cold storage = r+, c-

e <dig> = non-ripe; long-term cold storage = r-, c+

e <dig> = ripe: long-term cold storage = r+, c+

the maturity and physiological parameters of the fruits used to create these libraries are reported in campos-vargas et al  <cit> . these maturity and physiological parameters include firmness, percentage of total soluble solids, respiration rate and ethylene production  <cit> .

5' end sequencing of clones from these libraries resulted in a total of  <dig>  est sequences. assessment of these est sequences revealed that a total of  <dig>  ests are "good quality" sequences . relatively equal numbers of "good quality" ests from each of the four post-harvest conditions were used for further analyses .

as of may  <dig>  there were  <dig>  prunus persica est sequences in ncbi, of which  <dig>  ests correspond to sequences reported in this manuscript, but were publicly release to ncbi in  <dig> . these  <dig>  pre-release est sequences also make up almost half of the sequences available in the estree database   <cit> . in addition to the sequences we have release previously, we are releasing an additional  <dig>  est sequences with the publication of this manuscript. this is a total of  <dig>  ests which are being reported for the first time in this manuscript.

assembling these  <dig>  ests using cap <dig> 95/ <dig> resulted in the identification of  <dig>  unigenes . est distribution in the contigs is presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  blastn and blastx analyses revealed that  <dig> % of the contigs shared homology to sequences in public databases, whereas the remaining  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons showed no significant homology to the sequences in the public databases. interestingly, although there is a high level of homology between the consensus sequences of our unigenes and the sequences in public databases,  <dig>  of our unigenes contain novel sequence information, not present in public databases such as ncbi, estree, plantta, gdr and chillpeach  <cit> .

blast, interproscan and blast2go analyses were used to annotate the unigenes and ests  <cit> . gene ontology  annotations were assigned to the ests and contigs. detailed information associated with the ests, contig consensus sequences and their associated annotations are available to browse or download at  <cit> .

the length of the contig consensus sequences ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb, with an average length of  <dig>  kb . this large size detected in the consensus sequences suggests that some of these cdna clones may be full-length. analyses of the contig consensus sequences with eugène'hom  <cit>  enabled us to identify the components of a full-length cdna . these analyses identified  <dig> full-length cdnas, ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb . additionally,  <dig>  contigs represent putative full-length cdnas, in which the 5' utr and orf regions were detected. since we performed 5'-end sequencing on these putative full-length cdnas clones, they should contain the 3' utr. further 3' sequencing of these clones will confirm the full-length clones.

a the structure of the contig consensus sequence were analyzed using eugène'hom  <cit> . the results of this analysis were divided into  <dig> categories, 1: full-length ; 3: only 5' utr; 4: only orf - 3'utr; 5: only orf; 6: only 3'utr; 7: none of the previous mentioned structures.

a summary of the results from this eugène'hom analysis is presented in table  <dig>  the clones of these full-length cdnas have been identified by correlating the ests that are at the 5' end of the consensus sequences with the clones that these ests represent. correlations between the insert size of many of these clones and the size of the contig consensus sequence suggests that the eugène'hom predictions are accurate . since our cdna libraries were made in clontech's pdnr-1r vector, these full-length and putative full-length cdnas have flanking loxp recombination sites on both sites of the cdnas  <cit> .

differential expression of genes in each post-harvest stage
to estimate the distribution of ests from individual contigs among four cdna libraries, a two-dimensional hierarchical clustering using pair-wise average-linkage cluster analysis  <cit>  was applied. to ensure that contigs made up of a low number of ests are not unrepresented in the cluster analyses, the number of ests in each library was normalized proportionally to the total number of ests in their corresponding contig. the hierarchical clustering of the normalized contigs , revealed that the distribution of ests in e <dig>  and e <dig>  are more similar to each other when compared to e <dig>  or e <dig> . similarly, e <dig>  and e <dig>  are more similar to each other when compared to e <dig>  or e <dig> .

relative gene expression can be determined by statistically comparing the number of ests from a gene between different libraries or different genes in the same library  <cit> . pair-wise comparisons of the number of ests from each post-harvest condition, revealed differentially expressed genes . based on this statistical analysis,  <dig> contigs with at least one significant difference in gene expression were detected between the different post-harvest conditions. a total of  <dig> genes increase expression in ripe, juicy fruits  when compared to non-ripe fruits , whereas  <dig> genes are reduced . long-term cold stored fruits  increases the expression of  <dig> genes and decreases the expression of  <dig> genes when compared to fruits that have not undergone this long-term storage . fruits that are ripened following long-term cold storage and are woolly  have an increased expression of  <dig> genes and a decreased expression of  <dig> genes when compared to unripe fruits that have undergone long-term storage . a total of  <dig> genes have a statistically significant increase in expression in woolly ripened long-term cold stored fruits  when compared to juicy ripened fruits that have not been stored in the cold , whereas  <dig> genes are reduced .

this in silico analysis was validated by performing qpcr analyses on several of the contigs that showed differential gene expression levels based upon the pair-wise in silico analyses . figure  <dig> reveals differential gene expression confirmed by performing qpcr analyses of the following contigs under the four post-harvest conditions: wcor , dormancy-associated protein , polygalacturonase , luminal binding protein  <dig> , temperature-induced lipocalin  , and lipoxygenase  . this comparative analysis revealed that the in silico and qpcr assays yield similar results for these genes, under the conditions analyzed.

ripening related genes
the pair-wise comparison of est abundance of our contigs between two stages, revealed a significant increase in the transcript levels of  <dig> genes in these ripe fruits  when compared to the unripe fruits , and a reduction in the transcript levels of  <dig> genes . it is important to note that the fruits reported by campos-vargas et al  <cit>  are the same fruits that were used for constructing our libraries. as reported by campos-vargas et al  <cit> , ripe fruits were less firm than unripe fruits , but had a higher respiration rate  and ethylene production   <cit> .

the annotations of these differentially expressed transcripts reveal genes that participate in the physiological changes detected between ripe and unripe fruits. for example,  <dig> polygalacturonase transcripts  are accumulated higher in ripe fruits than unripe fruits , which may lead to the changes in fruit firmness. these contigs share high identity  with the polygalacturonase that was identified in microarray analyses of ripening fruits  <cit> . these results are consistent with the increase of endopolygalacturonase enzymatic activity in ripened peach fruits which has been reported previously  <cit> .

in addition to the increased transcript accumulation of polygalacturonases, we detected a decreased expression of pectate lyase  and pectin methylesterase inhibitor genes  . trainotti et al  <cit>  have detected increases in pectate lyase transcripts during the s4i phase of peach fruit ripening  and then decreases in the s4ii phase . our pair-wise comparisons of ests between ripe and unripe fruits detect a decrease in pectate lyase in ripe fruits when compared to unripe fruits . this decrease in pectate lyase gene expression as well as the reduction in firmness of the ripened fruits  <cit>  suggests that our e <dig> stage is similar to the s4ii stage described by trainotti et al  <cit> .

in addition to cell wall modifying enzymes, we have detected increased expression of genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis such as s-adenosyl methionine synthetase  and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  . the increase in expression of this acc oxidase  in ripe fruits has also been detected by trainotti et al  <cit> , whereas the sam synthetase was not. the differential expression of these genes may also explain the increase in ethylene production detected in the ripe  fruits.

as mentioned earlier, we have also detected an increased respiration in ripe fruits when compared to unripe fruits  <cit> . the pair-wise comparison reveals increased expression in several genes associated with glycolysis which may lead to this increase in respiration . these genes include fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , glyceraldehyde 2-phosphate dehydrogenase  and pyruvate decarboxylase .

cold-storage related genes
changes in firmness and respiration rate were also seen when unripe fruits stored at 4°c  were compared to unripe fruits prior to storage   <cit> . the pair-wise analyses reveal  <dig> genes that increase expression and  <dig> genes that decrease expression as a result of this long-term cold storage . several of these genes are associated with cell wall organization and, therefore, may be associated with the changes detected in firmness. genes that increase include: polygalacturonase inhibiting protein  <dig> , pectin methylesterase , basic endochitinase , and endopolygalacturonases . genes that decrease include: expansin , invertases/pectin methylesterase inhibitors , and pectate lyase . among these cell wall associated contigs, only the basic endochitinase  has been reported previously to have altered expression in long-term cold stored fruits  <cit> .

in addition to the altered expression of cell wall modifying proteins, we have also detected increased expression of glutathione peroxidase . glutathione peroxidase is an oxidative stress responsive gene, which suggests that the fruits that have been stored for prolonged periods of time have an increase in oxidative stress, possibly associated with the increased respiration rates. oxidative stress has been demonstrated in many species to be associated with chilling injury  <cit> .

among the genes differentially expressed between fruits that have undergone prolonged cold storage with those that have not, seven of these correspond to the genes that ogundiwin et al  <cit>  have also identified as having altered expression following cold storage . the remaining  <dig> contigs that are differentially expressed between unripe fruits stored at 4°c  and unripe fruits prior to storage  are novel and may participate in the adaptation and/or stress responses associated with long-term cold storage of these fruits.

wooliness response genes
when fruits that have been stored for long periods of time in cold storage  are removed from this storage and ripened , there is a significant decrease in firmness , a significant increase in ethylene production  and the fruits have a woolly phenotype  <cit> . the pair-wise analyses reveal an increased expression of  <dig> genes and a decreased expression of  <dig> genes in fruits that are ripened following long-term cold storage and are woolly  in comparison to unripe fruits that have undergone long-term storage but are unripe . additionally, these analyses reveal an increased expression of  <dig> genes and decreased expression of  <dig> genes when woolly fruits are compared to juicy fruits, .

the changes in firmness and the wooliness phenotype have been reported previously to be correlated with modifications in the levels of cell wall modifying enzymes  <cit> . as mentioned earlier, our pair-wise analyses have identified five polygalacturonase transcripts with increased accumulation in ripe fruits when compared to unripe fruits . of these five transcripts, two  have an increased accumulation following long-term cold storage. ripening of the cold stored fruits produces an increased accumulation of four of these polygalacturonase transcripts . however, when comparing juicy fruits with woolly fruits, there is less accumulation of three of these transcripts  in woolly fruits. these results suggest that in woolly peaches there are diverse polygalacturonase transcripts which are unable to accumulate to the levels normally present in ripe juicy fruits. these results are complementary to several studies that have linked polygalacturonase activity with wooliness  <cit> . interestingly, peace et al  <cit>  have also identified an endopolygalacturonase that co-localizes with a major qtl affecting both mealiness and bleeding. the large number of different polygalacturonase transcripts may be a result of alternative splicing or a recent gene duplication resulting in a highly conserved polygalacturonase gene family. the completion of the peach genome sequence will help to clarify whether these transcripts are a result of multiple genes or alternative splicing.

in addition to the changes in the accumulation of polygalacturonase transcripts, we have also identified a polygalacturonase inhibiting protein that has an inverse expression when compared to polygalacturonase in fruits that are ripened following a long-term cold storage and have a woolly phenotype. that is, there is a reduced expression of the polygalacturonase inhibiting protein in woolly fruits  when compared to unripe fruits that have undergone long-term cold storage . this reduction in the expression of the polygalacturonase inhibiting protein may lead to an increase in polygalacturonase activity and subsequent reduction in the fruit firmness. a similar pattern of reduced expression in fruits that are ripened following a long-term cold storage is also seen for another cell wall modifying enzyme, endochitinase .

a decrease in pectate lyase expression  was detected when comparing ripen fruits e <dig>  with unripe fruits e <dig> . however, a decrease in expression of this contig was also detected in fruits stored for prolonged periods of time in the cold , suggesting that this decrease may be similar to the decrease detected by trainotti et al  <cit>  in the s4ii stage . interestingly, the expression levels of this pectate lyase increased in woolly ripened long-term cold stored fruits  when compared to long-term cold stored fruits . we have previously reported a decreased transcript level of pectate lyase when woolly fruits were compared to juicy fruits by macroarray analyses  <cit> . one explanation for this is that the cold-storage may have reduced the pectate lyase transcript to a point that despite the increased expression of pectate lyase in woolly ripened long-term cold stored fruits  when compared to long-term cold stored fruits , the transcript levels in woolly fruits  are still lower than the levels detected in juicy fruits . alternatively, there may be a family of pectate lyase genes that are differentially expressed in the fruits, postharvest. it has been reported that in numerous species, pectate lyases are encoded by a large gene family  <cit> . we have identified three putative pectate lyases among our unigenes , suggesting that in peaches there is a pectate lyase gene family.

trainotti et al  <cit>  have demonstrated that three different expansin genes are expressed differentially during ripening. two of these expansin genes are up-regulated and one is down regulated in the s3/s <dig> transition  <cit> . we have identified seven contigs that are annotated as expansin or expansin family proteins . the expansin genes analyzed by trainotti et al  <cit>  correspond to contigs  <dig> and  <dig> in our unigene sets. interestingly, we have identified a novel expansin  that has increased transcript levels in woolly fruits when compared to juicy fruits. since there are higher levels of the transcript for this contig in ripe, juicy fruits  in comparison to unripe fruits that have been stored for a long period of time , the increase in expansin levels in woolly fruits  is occurring during the ripening process by a factor that cold storage has affected, and is not due to an increase in expansin levels in cold-stored fruits.

trainotti et al  <cit>  have also seen an increased expression of pectin methylesterase in s4i  and s4ii ripened fruits . our pair-wise comparison has detected an increased pectin methylesterase-like protein transcript  in woolly fruits when compared to juicy fruits. increased transcripts that correspond to this contig were detected when comparing long-term cold storage fruits  with fruits from packing . this suggests that the increase in this pectin methylesterase gene was induced by cold storage and remained elevated following ripening and the development of the woolly phenotype.

in addition to the changes in the expression of pectin methylesterase, we have detected eight pectin methylesterase inhibitor proteins in our unigenes . pair-wise analyses detected differential expression of three of these contigs . two of these contigs  have similar patterns of differential expression under different post-harvest conditions. both of these contigs have a reduced expression in ripe fruits with and without long-term cold storage . contig  <dig> also has a reduced expression in ripe juicy fruits. however, this contig has an increased expression in woolly ripened long-term cold stored fruits  when compared to unripe fruits that have undergone long-term storage . in the model plant arabidopsis, there is a family of pectin methylesterase inhibitors and invertases  <cit> . in vitro studies of pectin methylesterase inhibitors have been shown to have specific targets  <cit> . therefore, the differential expression between the different contigs that code for pectin methylesterase inhibitors may have different targets. however, it is important to mention that these different contigs may be the product of different transcripts from a single locus, rather than a gene family. future mapping of these ests to the peach physical map will help to clarify this possibility  <cit> .

as mentioned earlier ethylene production has been shown to participate in peach fruit ripening  <cit> . we have detected an acc oxidase gene  whose expression is increased in ripe fruits when compared to unripe fruits. however, there is a reduction in acc oxidase  expression in woolly fruits  when compared to juicy fruits . this reduced expression of acc oxidase may be associated with the wooliness phenotype. however, the ethylene production in the woolly fruits was higher than juicy fruits  <cit> , suggesting that there are other genes associated with ethylene production that may also be altered.

we have also identified a number of genes associated with membrane formation and stress related genes that are differentially expressed under the different postharvest conditions analyzed. a large number of the genes that we have identified as being differentially expressed in response to cold, ripening or a combination of these two stimuli, have not been reported previously. therefore, the large number of genes identified as having altered expression in response to the individual or combined effects of ripening and long-term cold storage, demonstrates the complexity of the processes that are occurring in peach fruits post harvest and the differential expression of gene families. further analyses of the expression of these genes and the factors that cause this differential expression may provide interesting clues about the mechanisms associated with wooliness.

identification of genes that are co-expressed under different post-harvest conditions
to identify clusters of genes that are co-expressed under different post-harvest conditions, a k-means analysis was performed to identify groups of genes with similar expression profiles. k-means clustering was performed using  <dig> different clusters with a maximum of  <dig> iterations, each containing between  <dig> and  <dig> genes . the optimal number of clusters was determined to be  <dig> by figure of merit analyses .

groups of clusters that correlate the gene expression profiles with the different post-harvest conditions are clearly visible when these groups are analyzed and compared . one group  is represented by two clusters of genes  whose expression profiles are inversely related in juicy, ripe fruits , when compared to the other post harvest stages. cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with reduced expression exclusively in juicy, ripe fruits , whereas cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with increased expression exclusively in these same fruits. it is important to note this comparison is not a pair-wise comparison, rather a comparison between all four post-harvest conditions . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> reveal a decrease and increase in gene expression in juicy fruits, respectively, which is not present in woolly fruits. genes that are differentially expressed in juicy fruits and not woolly fruits are genes that may be participating in the woolly phenotype. analyses of these sequences and their corresponding gene ontology annotations reveal that ripe peaches have an increase in metabolic processes, especially processes associated with the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids and secondary metabolites . in contrast, there is a decrease in translation, transport, and signal transduction processes. according to the go annotations, it appears as though there is an increase in the expression of genes that are associated with mitochondria and plastids, as well as a decrease in those associated with ribosomes and the plasma membrane. many of the metabolic process described earlier are carried out in the mitochondria and plastids, supporting this trend. the decrease in translation also correlates with the decrease in processes associated with the ribosome. these analyses suggest that woolly fruits lack the increased boost of metabolic processes necessary for ripening, such as the expression of cell wall modifying enzymes as well as the production of sugars and aromatic secondary metabolites. the changes in expression of cell wall modifying enzymes is consistent with what has been reported previously  <cit> . however, these cluster analyses reveal the organelles that may actively participate in these processes as well as a large number of genes and gene families that should be analyzed for their participation in the altered metabolic processes present in woolly fruits.

in addition to the absence of the modified gene expression patterns seen in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  there is another pair of clusters that represent the opposite tendency. clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  represent genes that change their expression exclusively in woolly fruits e <dig> . cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with increased expression exclusively in woolly fruits, whereas cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with decreased expression exclusively in woolly fruits. in these clusters, there is a notable increase in the expression of genes associated with processes such as translation, transport, response to abiotic stress and cellular organization and biogenesis. interestingly, the combined results of clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  demonstrate that woolly fruits have lost the reduced expression of genes associated with transcription and translation. additionally, following abiotic stress conditions such as long-term cold storage, it is not surprising to see increased expression of abiotic stress related genes in woolly fruits. however, it should be noted that this class of abiotic stress related genes are distinct from those identified exclusively in the cold . as was seen in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  many of the differentially expressed genes that are differentially expressed exclusively in woolly fruits appear to be associated with the mitochondria, plastids and ribosomes. the participation of the mitochondria and plastids also correlate well with the increase in respiration that was detected in these fruits  <cit> . the plasma membrane is also participating, possibly associated with abiotic stress responses such as cold and/or desiccation stresses.

the identification of genes that are associated with mitochondrial and plastid processes, as well as the differential expression of genes such as glutathione peroxidase, suggests that oxidative stress and metabolic imbalances may play a major role in wooliness. interestingly, recent publications have presented physiological analyses that support this hypothesis  <cit> .

yet another group represents genes that are differentially expressed exclusively in unripe fruits that have undergone long-term cold storage e <dig> . this group is represented by clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with reduced expression exclusively in non-ripe fruits that have undergone a long-term cold storage , whereas cluster  <dig> contains  <dig> genes with increased expression exclusively in these same fruits. surprisingly, only  <dig> of the genes, present in cluster  <dig> correspond to genes identified as being differentially expressed by ogundiwin et al  <cit> . differentially expressed genes, identified by ogundiwin et al  <cit> , appear in clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, we have identified a very large number of novel genes that are associated specifically with the unripe fruits that have undergone long-term cold storage. these genes are associated with a large number of biological processes in multiple regions of the cell. by further analyzing the function of these genes we may be able to better understand the specific modifications that have occurred in the fruit under long-term cold storage that ultimately results in the modification in the ripening process that result in woolly fruits.

CONCLUSIONS
by sequencing a large number of ests from cdna libraries representing peach mesocarp from four different post-harvest conditions, we have begun to identify the individual and combined effects that long-term cold storage  and ripening  have on the transcripts in this tissue.

 <dig>  unigenes  were formed by assembling a total of  <dig>  ests. these est sequences have been deposited in genbank and the sequence information associated with the unigenes is available at . additionally, since the libraries that were used in this sequencing effort were enriched for large inserts and are cloned within two flanking lox-p sites in the pdnr-1r vector , we have a collection of full-length clones which may be easily recombined with vectors that contain single loxp sites, for rapid cloning into other expression vectors and for functional analyses of these genes.

in addition to the sequence information and full-length clones developed in this work, digital analyses of est abundance in the four different post-harvest conditions has revealed a large number of candidate genes with fluctuating transcript levels in response to factors such as ripening, long-term cold storage and a combination of these two factors .

these analyses have enabled us to statistically identify novel genes and gene clusters that are differentially expressed in response to post-harvest factors such long-term cold storage, ripening and/or a combination of these two factors. these differentially expressed genes reveal the participation of specific metabolic processes that normally occur in ripen fruits that do not occur in woolly fruits, as well as novel processes that are occurring in the woolly fruits that are not normally present in ripen fruits.

these analyses also demonstrate the need to better identify and understand the specificity and expression of gene families and/or different transcripts from a single gene in post-harvest processes. additionally, these analyses present data that suggests that wooliness is not only due to modifications of the cell wall, but may also include stress response pathways and oxidative damage.

the est sequences and full-length cdna clones developed in this work, combined with the large population of differentially expressed genes may serve as useful tools and markers that will enable the scientific community to better understand the molecular and cellular processes that affect fruit quality in response to post-harvest conditions and the large number of gene products that participate in these processes. by understanding these processes, this knowledge may be used in the future to improve post-harvest fruit quality.
