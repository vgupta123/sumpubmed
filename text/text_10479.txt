BACKGROUND
in s. cerevisiae, telomeres are usually maintained by telomerase or rad52-dependent recombination. the 'ever shorter telomere' genes est <dig>  est <dig> , est <dig>  and tlc <dig>  are essential for telomerase function because loss of any one gene results in progressive telomere shortening and senescence  <cit> . mutation of cdc <dig> - an essential gene - elicits similar consequences  <cit> . rare "survivors" can bypass this senescence by maintaining telomeres through recombination. the homologous recombination factor rad <dig> is important for the generation of telomerase-independent type i and type ii survivors in which telomeres are maintained by amplification of y' elements or telomeric repeats, respectively; more rarely, survival can occur without rad <dig>  <cit> .

cdc <dig> and est <dig> are critical for the recruitment of the telomerase core complex  to telomeres in s phase . cdc <dig> binds to single-stranded telomeric dna  <cit>  and associates with telomeres throughout the cell cycle, with a peak in association during s phase  <cit> . est <dig> also binds to single-stranded telomeric dna  <cit>  and associates with telomeres in s phase  <cit> . cdc <dig> and est <dig> interact physically  <cit>  and genetically, as evidenced by the unlinked complementation of cdc13- <dig> and est1- <dig> alleles, each of which affects telomere maintenance and viability  <cit> . several findings suggest that est <dig> recruits est <dig> to the telomere in s phase by acting as an intermediary between cdc <dig> and tlc <dig>  for example, the telomere shortening and senescence that occur in the absence of est <dig> are rescued by expression of a cdc13-est <dig> fusion protein  <cit> . est <dig> binds to tlc <dig>  <cit> , and the telomeric localization of est <dig> in s phase is reduced when the region of tlc <dig> responsible for the est <dig> interaction is deleted, or when est <dig> is deleted  <cit> .

in other organisms, est <dig> homologs similarly associate with telomerase and regulate telomere length and stability, although in some instances their precise contributions to telomere function are still being uncovered. s. pombe est <dig> associates with active telomerase in cell extracts, and est1- cells exhibit telomere shortening, senescence, and defects in chromosome end protection  <cit> . in c. albicans, telomere length in est1Δ cells fluctuates over serial passages, suggesting that est <dig> may repress homologous recombination at telomeres  <cit> . in humans, three est <dig> homologs, hest1a/smg <dig>  hest1b/smg <dig> and hest1c/smg <dig>  interact with chromatin and bind preferentially at telomeres  <cit> . human est1a and est1b associate with active telomerase in cell lysates and in vitro  <cit> . like scest <dig>  hest1a binds single-stranded telomeric dna  <cit> . transient over-expression  of hest1a causes telomere uncapping/end-to-end fusion and apoptosis, and stable over-expression of hest1a in telomerase-positive cell lines elicits telomere shortening that can be mitigated by co-expression of htert  <cit> .

human est1a, est1b, and est1c also possess functional homology to the c. elegans nonsense-mediated mrna decay  factors smg- <dig>  smg- <dig>  and smg- <dig>  <cit> . transcripts containing premature termination codons  upstream of a terminal exon-exon junction are degraded by nonsense-mediated mrna decay  - a process involving the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of upf <dig> by smg <dig> and pp2a, respectively . the three est <dig> proteins form complexes with smg <dig>  upf <dig>  pp2a, and other components of the nmd pathway  <cit> , and mediate the dephosphorylation of upf <dig> via recruitment of pp2a  <cit> . depletion of hest1a, hest1b or hest1c by rna interference results in stabilization of ptc-containing mrna  <cit> . depletion of upf <dig>  smg <dig>  or hest1a/smg <dig> also leads to an increase in the intensity and number of foci containing the telomeric transcript terra . parenthetically, the levels of s. cerevisiae est <dig>  est <dig>  est <dig>  stn <dig>  and ten <dig> are regulated by nmd  <cit> , but scest <dig> has no known role in nmd  <cit> .

the complex functions of est <dig> homologs are mirrored by their diversity in size and structure across species . the region of highest homology among est <dig> proteins includes tetratricopeptide repeat  consensus sequences  <cit>  . typically, tprs mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the structure of hest1c reveals a bona fide 14-3-3-like tpr comprised of alpha helices; several contiguous upstream alpha helices fold into a tpr-like structure despite the fact they lack a tpr repeat consensus sequence  <cit> . upstream of the tpr, hest1a contains an n-terminal dna binding activity , and the n-terminus also interacts with htr and other rnas through an htr-interaction domain   <cit> . a region downstream of the hest1b tpr resembles the dna binding domain of scest <dig>  <cit> , although dna binding by hest1b has not been described. both hest1a and hest1b contain a c-terminal 'pilt n-terminal'  domain  <cit> . the pin domain of hest1a possesses a single-stranded rna endonuclease activity and degrades ptc-containing mrna  <cit> . the nuclease activity of the hest1b pin domain is greatly reduced likely due to the absence of critical residues in the active site  <cit> . this extensive cross-species complexity prompted us to conduct structure-function analysis of human and s. cerevisiae est <dig> proteins using biochemical and genetic methods.

RESULTS
mapping the interactions between hest1a and htert
although it was known that hest1a interacts with htert in vitro independently of htr  <cit> , and that tprs typically mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> , it was unknown whether the tpr was sufficient for the interaction between hest1a and htert. fragments of hest1a spanning all or part of the tpr  proved unsuitable for in vitro interaction analysis as they precipitated non-specifically . an hest1a fragment spanning a.a. 114- <dig> did not exhibit non-specific precipitation but failed to exhibit a significant interaction with htert fragments . increasing the c-terminal boundary to fully encompass the minimal tpr domain spanning a.a 695- <dig>  resulted in a reproducible enrichment of hest1a onto anti-flag agarose in the presence of flag-htert fragments spanning amino acids 1- <dig>  1- <dig>  201- <dig>  601- <dig>  but not fragments spanning 201- <dig> or 350- <dig>  a control protein , or mock translation reactions containing no input cdna . the htert-hest1a interactions were not perturbed by micrococcal nuclease, indicating that they did not require nucleic acids . taken together, these data identify at least one interaction interface within htert that includes residues beyond a.a.  <dig> that are important  for an interaction with hest1a.

to further refine the htert protein interaction interface within the hest1a tpr, we introduced various mutations within a.a. 551- <dig> of hest1a that we predicted to lie on the protein surface , and tested these fragments for an htr-independent interaction with htert or htert . none of the  <dig> introduced mutations, including the  <dig> residues mutated between hest1a a.a.  <dig> and  <dig>  perturbed the interaction of hest1a with either htert fragment   <cit> . in addition, removal of a sequence in hest1a  corresponding to a putative disordered loop in hest1c  <cit>  did not disrupt the hest1a-htert interaction . thus, despite the existence of a putative htert interaction interface in hest1a  that includes a tpr domain , we were unable to identify residues within the tpr essential for this interaction.

we also tested the effect of mutations within the htert n-terminus on the interaction with hest1a. two dat  regions in htert, when substituted for six amino acids  beginning at codons  <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> , also proved dispensable for the interaction with hest1a . dat mutations have subtle effects on telomerase catalysis in vitro but dramatic deficits in telomere elongation and lifespan extension in vivo that can be partially rescued by fusion of htert-dat to pot <dig> or trf <dig>  <cit> . our data suggest this in vivo deficit is not the result of a perturbed interaction with hest1a.

non-conservation of est <dig> tpr function between species
recent data establish that hest1c, of which the closest s. cerevisiae homolog is ebs <dig>  plays a similar role as ebs <dig> in nmd  <cit> . thus, we wished to determine if hest1a or hest1b might display functional similarity with scest <dig>  despite various strategies, we were unable to observe expression of full-length hest1a, b, c in s. cerevisiae, which precluded analysis of whether human est <dig> homologs might, alone or in combination, complement the senescence phenotype of strains lacking est <dig>  an alternate strategy was to test whether a region of est <dig> containing the tpr could be "swapped" between species. using an in vivo gap-repair cloning strategy in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , the tpr of scest <dig> was replaced with the tpr of hest1a, hest1b or hest1c or gfp  . the boundaries of the tpr were estimated according to the structure-based sequence alignment of est <dig> homologs  <cit> . specifically, the first nine alpha helices of hest1c, or the corresponding region of hest1a or hest1b, were integrated into the corresponding region of scest <dig> 

we first verified that est1Δ and est1Δ rad52Δ haploid strains generated from a diploid strain  underwent senescence as expected  <cit> . next, we tested the ability of low-copy  or high-copy  hybrid est <dig> expression plasmids  to rescue senescence in two separately isolated est1Δ rad52Δ haploid spores . although the resultant tpr hybrid proteins were expressed , neither the gfp-est <dig> hybrid nor any of the human tpr-est <dig> hybrids proved sufficient to rescue senescence or maintain telomere length when spores were passaged every two days . extension of the time between colony propagation from two days to four days, which promotes the rare survival  of populations lacking telomerase and rad <dig>  <cit> , also failed to permit complementation with the est <dig> tpr hybrid proteins . the tpr hybrids also failed to exert a dominant interfering effect on cell viability or telomere length maintenance in an est <dig> rad52Δ strain . therefore, replacement of the cognate tpr of scest <dig> with the tpr of hest1a, b, or c neither complemented nor interfered with wild-type scest <dig> 

dissection of est <dig> tpr function by mutagenesis
since the tprs of hest1a, b, or c were unable to function in place of the tpr of scest <dig>  we mutated residues within and just outside the scest <dig> tpr domain and assessed effects on function in vivo. selected residues that we predicted to be exposed to the concave surface of the putative protein-protein interaction interface  were changed to alanine  <cit>  ; all mutants complemented the viability of est1Δ rad52Δ strains over multiple generations and did not interfere with viability in rad52Δ strains . the average telomere length of cell populations expressing wild-type flag-tagged est <dig> were compared with those expressing flag-tagged est <dig> point mutants including est <dig> - a mutant which confers viability in the absence of endogenous est <dig> but maintains shorter-than-wild-type telomere lengths  <cit>  . like cells expressing est <dig>  cells expressing est1-flag exhibited slightly shorter telomeres . unexpectedly, est1Δ rad52Δ cells containing certain est1-flag mutants - namely e92a/q96a/w97a, r193a/n197a, s200a/f203a/y204a, f243a/q244a/k247a, n277a/n278a, or d281a/t285a - exhibited longer telomeres than cells containing wild-type est1-flag . telomere lengths appeared to slightly increase upon successive passages with certain mutants such as n277a/n278a, e92a/q96a/w97a and s200a/f203a/y204a . the elongation phenotype was not due to overexpression of est <dig>  since telomere lengths in cells overexpressing wild-type est <dig>  did not differ from strains lacking high-copy est <dig> . the differences in telomere lengths relative to wild-type est <dig> and to each other were reproducible with different strain isolates . although we did not test the protein expression levels of all point mutants, larger perturbations in est <dig>  did not alter est <dig> levels relative to wild-type est1-flag . thus, the different effects of tpr mutations on telomere length suggest that distinct residues in the vicinity or within the tpr domain function in telomere length maintenance, while other residues may function to limit telomere elongation.

the est1-flag mutants were also tested for their effect on telomere length homeostasis in an est <dig> rad52Δ strain . est <dig>  which elicited shorter telomeres in an est1Δ rad52Δ background, did not elicit telomere attrition in the presence of wild-type est <dig> . expression of the est1-flag mutants  in a rad52Δ background resulted in slightly longer telomeres that persisted for five passages . thus, these mutants may interfere with an ability of wild-type est <dig> to inhibit telomere elongation. est <dig> led to shorter telomeres in a rad52Δ background similar to the effect observed in a rad52Δ est1Δ strain , suggesting an ability of this mutation to interfere with wtest <dig> function. the flag tag itself did not interfere with est <dig> function, since telomeres in strains overexpressing est1-flag  or untagged est <dig> were maintained at a similar length as strains expressing only endogenous est <dig> . collectively, these data suggest that mutations within the est <dig> tpr permitted complementation of est1Δ cells; in some instances, concomitant telomere shortening or elongation was observed that suggested both positive and negative regulatory roles for the tpr in telomere length homeostasis.

recruitment of est <dig> point mutants to telomeric chromatin
to test whether mutation of the est <dig> tpr affected recruitment to the telomere, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations  experiments. yeast lysates were subjected to crosslinking and sonication to obtain chromatin fragments approximately  <dig> bp in length, followed by immunoprecipitation onto anti-flag m <dig> resin. pcr analysis was performed using primers designed to amplify a single-copy genomic locus  or the subtelomeric region of the right arm of chromosome x . after normalization to both input genomic dna and the ars <dig> amplification signal, wild-type est1-flag  exhibited a significant fold-enrichment at telomeric chromatin relative to same strain lacking scest1-flag . we next tested three flag-tagged est <dig> mutants  for enrichment at telomeric chromatin in the est1Δ rad52Δ background. all three mutants exhibited telomeric enrichment similar to est1-flag . notably, mutants associated with telomere elongation  or shortening  exhibited equivalent enrichment. the similar levels of enrichment also suggest that fluctuations in telomere length are not simply due to changes in the level of est <dig> protein recruited to telomeric heterohromatin . these data suggest that the effects on telomere length equilibrium conferred by the est <dig> tpr mutants may involve steps downstream of recruitment to the telomere.

discussion
species-specific differences in the tert-est <dig> interaction
our observation that n- and c-terminal regions of htert can interact with hest1a  independently of htr extends previous findings  <cit> . redon et al. showed that an htr-dependent interaction occurs between htert and hest1a, and that htert may interact with hest1a fragments beyond a.a. 212- <dig> independently of htr  <cit>  . collectively, our results suggest that htert forms protein-protein contacts with the tpr of hest1a. as yet, the specific amino acids responsible for these interactions have not been identified. that the hest1a tpr exhibits multiple contacts with discrete htert fragments is not without precedent; the htert amino-terminus  also exhibits specific interactions with itself and the htert c-terminus, suggesting that an hest1a interaction could be bridged by intramolecular htert interactions in vivo  <cit> . in addition, hten exhibits specific interactions with telomeric dna and tpp <dig> that stimulate repeat addition processivity  <cit> . taken together, these data underscore that multiple protein-protein and protein-dna interaction interfaces serve to regulate htert function in vivo.

like the interaction between hest1a and htert, the interaction between est <dig> and est <dig> may involve both protein-protein and protein-rna contacts. est <dig> and est <dig> interact with separate regions of tlc <dig>  <cit> , and est <dig> does not co-purify with est <dig> in a tlc1Δ strain, suggesting that tlc <dig> is required to assemble the telomerase complex  <cit> . however, recent findings suggest that recombinant scest <dig> stimulates telomerase activity even when the tlc1-est <dig> interaction is compromised, and that tlc <dig> stimulates but is not required for an est1-est <dig> interaction in rrl  <cit> . these results suggest that est <dig> and telomerase may also interact through protein contacts.

the tpr of scest <dig> may be involved in binding tlc <dig>  mutations at residues that we predicted to reside on the convex surface of the domain  elicit telomere shortening and perturb association with tlc <dig>  <cit> . none of the mutations that we introduced into the putative concave surface of the tpr of hest1a reduced the interaction with htert. mutagenesis of the convex surface of hest1a tpr may yet identify an htert interaction interface.

the tprs within hest1c and hest1a bind a phosphopeptide within upf1; these interactions are reduced by k66e/r163e and r625e/r706e mutations , respectively, or by phosphatase treatment  <cit> . in our studies, the r625e/r706e or d703/r706/y707/y <dig> mutations in hest1a did not disrupt the interactions with htert or . since htert is phosphorylated by akt and c-abl in vivo  <cit> , hest1a may bind an as yet unmapped phosphomotif in htert. alternatively, upf <dig> and htert may interact with distinct interfaces of the hest1a tpr. by analogy, in s. cerevisiae, components of the anaphase-promoting complex  each contain multiple tpr repeats. mutation of one tpr within cdc <dig> impairs its interaction with cdc <dig>  but does not appreciably affect binding to cdc <dig>  or cdc <dig> self-association  <cit> .

a role for the scest <dig> tpr in curtailing telomere elongation downstream of telomere binding
we found that mutations within the scest <dig> tpr that affected telomere length equilibrium did not reduce the association of est <dig> with telomeric heterochromatin in asynchronous cultures. since est <dig> recruitment to telomeres peaks in s phase  <cit> , further experiments in synchronized cultures may reveal further nuances of the influence of these mutations on the temporal regulation of telomere recruitment. the fact that the mutants showed a comparable enrichment to that of wild-type est <dig> suggests that these scest <dig> tpr residues are nonetheless dispensable for an interaction with cdc <dig>  and is consistent with the notion that the perturbation of telomere length reflects a defect downstream of telomere recruitment.

while certain mutations predicted to disrupt the concave surface of the est <dig> tpr elicited telomere shortening, other similarly predicted mutations elicited telomere elongation. the concave surface of the est <dig> tpr may negatively regulate telomere length through an interaction with ies <dig> - a component of the ino <dig> chromatin remodeling complex  <cit> . as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, est <dig> and ies <dig> interact, and deletion of ies <dig> results in telomere lengthening  <cit> . mutation of three amino acids within the tpr of est <dig>  abolishes the ies <dig> interaction  <cit> . this triple mutation impairs tlc <dig> binding and elicits telomere shortening, thus precluding a direct assessment of the ies3-est <dig> interaction in telomere length regulation  <cit> . in contrast, we observed that alanine replacement of n277/n <dig> in est <dig> led to telomere elongation. thus, it is possible that the n277a/n278a mutation might disrupt interaction with ies <dig> without perturbing tlc <dig> association, which would support a direct role for the ies3-est <dig> interaction in the negative regulation of telomere length by the ino <dig> complex  <cit> . our results indicate that the tpr-containing region within scest <dig> positively and negatively regulates telomere length, and that the concave surface of the tpr domain appears important for est <dig> function.

functional specialization of key cellular processes within and between species
we observed that the tprs of human est <dig> proteins could not substitute for the scest <dig> tpr. functional differences in other telomere-associated proteins have been noted across species. two related 5'-3' helicases in s. cerevisiae, pif <dig> and rrm <dig>  perform non-overlapping functions in inhibiting telomerase recruitment and promoting dna fork progression, respectively  <cit> , and both contribute to mitochondrial dna stability in distinct ways  <cit> . in s. pombe, the single pif1/rrm <dig> ortholog pfh <dig> is essential; some, but not all, of its diverse roles in mitochondrial, nuclear and telomere dna replication are complemented by scrrm <dig>  <cit> . in mammals, although the pif1/rrm <dig> ortholog interacts with telomerase, it is dispensable for viability, telomere length maintenance, and chromosome healing  <cit> . similarly, rif <dig> plays a critical regulatory role in telomere homeostasis in yeasts [reviewed in  <cit> , while in mammals rif <dig> modulates genome stability in response to dna damage and appears dispensable for telomere length regulation  <cit> .

in s. cerevisiae, the nmd-related function of est <dig> homologs may have been delegated primarily to ebs <dig>  which shares the most sequence similarity  with hest1c  <cit> . strains lacking ebs <dig> possess short telomeres  <cit>  and, unlike est1Δ strains, exhibit a defect in nmd  <cit> . over-expression of hest1c or ebs <dig> in s. cerevisiae disrupts nmd  <cit> . in a. thaliana, est1c/smg <dig> is an essential gene with a role in nmd and meiotic cell cycle progression, but possesses no apparent role in telomere integrity or length regulation  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine whether mutations exist within the hest1a tpr that selectively affect nmd or an interaction with htert. if a telomerase-specific interaction interface within hest1a exists, it may represent an attractive target for telomerase inhibition in cancer since its short-term perturbation might spare other essential functions of est <dig> related to telomere end protection or nmd.

CONCLUSIONS
a fragment of hest1a of approximately  <dig> a.a. and encompassing the tetratricopeptide repeat  was sufficient for nucleic acid-independent interactions with the n-terminus of htert . the tpr of scest <dig> could not be complemented genetically by tprs of the human est <dig> homologs hest1a, hest1b, or hest1c, suggesting that the former has evolved species-specific interactions that cannot be substituted by human est <dig> tprs. mutagenesis within and just outside the scest <dig> tpr identified residues important for telomere length homeostasis but not recruitment to telomeric heterochromatin. collectively, these data identify species-specific roles of the est <dig> tpr domain in the recognition of htert and regulation of telomere length.
