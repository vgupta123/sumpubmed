BACKGROUND
many archaeal and bacterial species have the ability to sense environmental parameters and use this information to direct their movement in response to gradients towards more favorable locations  <cit> . this process, called taxis, is in both prokaryotic domains of life based on a modified two-component signal transduction system , and a motility organelle. the best understood motility organelle in bacteria, and the only one known in archaea, is the flagellum, a rotating, propeller-like structure . in response to external stimuli, the taxis signal transduction system modulates the frequency by which the flagellar motor changes its direction of rotation, and thus enables a biased random walk, and leads to movement to places with improved environmental conditions .

even though several variations of the taxis signaling system exist in different bacterial and archaeal species , the overall mechanism, as well as the proteins involved, are conserved . the receptors, also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins , sense a multitude of environmental stimuli such as various chemicals, oxygen, osmolarity and, in h. salinarum, also light. they regulate the autophosphorylation activity of the histidine kinase chea, which is coupled to them by the adaptor protein chew  <cit> . after autophosphorylation, the phosphoryl group is transferred from chea to the response regulator chey  <cit> . phosphorylated chey  is the flagellar motor switch factor  <cit> . hence chea acts as an integrator of diverse stimuli to generate an unambiguous output for the flagellar motor. other proteins mediate adaptation to the signal   <cit>  and removal of the phosphate from chey-p   <cit> .

in bacteria, chey-p binds to the flagellar motor switch protein flim  <cit> , which forms together with flin and flig, and in b. subtilis also fliy, the motor switch complex. the binding site of chey-p is the highly conserved n-terminal region of flim  <cit> . without bound chey-p, the flagellar motor in bacteria rotates in one default direction. binding of chey-p increases the probability that the motor switches to rotation in the opposite direction .

the taxis signal transduction system of h. salinarum is built from  <dig> receptors , and the che proteins a, y, w <dig>  w <dig>  r, b, c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and d  <cit> . due to its ability to perform phototaxis, h. salinarum is an excellent model organism for studying cellular responses. in several studies, detailed data of the halobacterial response to light has been obtained  <cit> , which allowed the generation of a quantitative model of the flagellar motor switch and its sensory control in this organism  <cit> . however, in spite of the good understanding of the switch cycle in h. salinarum on a systems level, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

in archaea and bacteria, the flagellar apparatus is composed of three functional units: the flagellar filament, the motor, and its switch, which allows the motor to change its rotational direction. despite this superficial similarity, these motility organelles are distinct structures in both domains, which are not related to each other . for the proteins constituting the bacterial flagellar apparatus, no homologs have been detected in archaeal genomes, suggesting very strongly that the archaeal motility apparatus must be built from different components  <cit> . furthermore, the archaeal flagellar motor is not driven by proton-motive force  like most bacterial motors, but either by atp directly or by an atp-dependent ion gradient which is not coupled to pmf   <cit> . in some respects, archaeal flagella resemble bacterial type iv pili more than bacterial flagella  <cit> . known components of the archaeal flagellar apparatus are the flagellins, which compose the filament, and a number of conserved proteins that are coded by genes located close to the flagellin genes in archaeal genomes: the flagella accessory genes flac, flad, flae, flaf, flag, flah, flai, and flaj  <cit> . in h. salinarum and other archaea of the families halobacteriales and methanomicrobia, the flac and flae proteins are fused to one polypeptide  <cit> . the exact role of the fla proteins is not understood, but it has been shown by deletion mutations that they are required for flagellation  <cit> . a role in flagellar biosynthesis was suggested, because flai and flaj are homologous to proteins from the bacterial type ii secretion system and type iv pili biogenesis system  <cit> .

chey-p is the flagellar motor switch factor also in h. salinarum and probably also other archaea  <cit> . however, the interaction site of chey-p is unknown, since for its target protein in bacteria, flim, just as for all other proteins constituting the bacterial flagellar apparatus, no homologs can be found in archaeal genomes  <cit> . no equivalent to the chey-p binding peptide has been identified either.

besides chey-p, fumarate is a further factor involved in flagellar motor switching, both in archaea  and bacteria . in e. coli, fumarate reductase  was identified as the target of fumarate at the motor, where it was shown to interact with the flagellar motor switch protein flig  <cit> . in h. salinarum, which has neither a frd nor a flig, fumarate must act by a different, till now unknown mechanism.

hence, the connection between the archaeal flagellar apparatus, the bacterial-like taxis signal transduction system, and the enigmatic fumarate pathway has remained elusive. here we report the identification of three proteins that interact with chey, chec <dig>  and ched as well as flace and flad, thereby building a link between the taxis signal transduction system and the archaeal flagellar apparatus. by assaying deletion mutants, we demonstrated that two of these proteins are essential for control of the direction of rotation of the flagellar motor. two of the proteins belong to the protein family duf <dig>  we found that the members of this family are generally and exclusively present in archaeal che gene regions. we conclude that duf <dig> describes essential archaeal chemotaxis proteins for which we propose the name chef.

RESULTS
oe2401f, oe2402f, and oe2404r interact with che and fla proteins
protein interaction analysis of the halobacterial che proteins  revealed two proteins of unknown function, oe2402f and oe2404r, as interaction partners of chey, ched, and chec <dig>  these proteins are homologous to each other and are coded by adjacent genes, located between the che genes and the type b flagellins .

to determine the role of oe2402f and oe2404r, these proteins were used as baits in additional bait fishing experiments. both proteins were shown to interact with the flagellar accessory proteins flace, and oe2404r also with flad . the third protein, coded by a gene located between the che gene region and flagellins, oe2401f, was also subjected to protein interaction analysis, although it was not detected as an interaction partner in previous experiments. oe2401f was shown to interact with ched and oe2402f.

these results indicate that all three proteins play a role in the chemotaxis signaling pathway of h. salinarum. due to their interaction with che proteins as well as with fla proteins, the newly identified proteins build a link between the chemotaxis signal transduction system and the archaeal flagellar apparatus.

construction of in-frame deletion mutants
to elucidate the function of the newly identified proteins, in-frame deletion strains for oe2401f-oe2404r  and a double deletion ΔΔoe2402f oe2404r  were created using a two-step recombination method  <cit> . as host, two h. salinarum strains were used: strain r <dig> was used, because it is considered as wildtype and this strain was previously used for ppi analysis . the same deletion mutations were also constructed in strain s <dig>  because s <dig> cells are better suited for motion analysis and determination of the flagellar rotational bias, whereas r <dig> cells tend to stick to the glass surface of the microscope slides  <cit> . clones that had undergone the second recombination event were screened for the absence of the target gene by pcr and confirmed by southern blot analysis using probes for the target gene and its upstream region . dna from the deletion strains did not hybridize with the gene probe, and showed the expected size decrease when probed with the gene's upstream region.

since the deletions in both parent strains s <dig> and r <dig> exhibited the same phenotype, they will be discussed together in the following sections. as independent biological replicates, the use of two parent strains gives a high degree of certainty for the phenotypic findings.

oe2401f and oe2402f are essential for chemotaxis and phototaxis
to examine the effect of the deletions on chemotaxis and motility, the deletion strains were analyzed by swarm plate assays. a swarm plate is a semi-solid agar plate in which the cells are inoculated. the agar concentration is low enough to allow movement of the cells in the agar. after point inoculation the cells grow, metabolize various nutrients, and create a concentration gradient. cells which are motile and capable of chemotaxis move along this gradient away from the inoculation site, forming extended rings, called swarm rings. figure  <dig> shows representative swarm plates for each deletion in s <dig>  compared to wildtype . after three days of growth, the wild type strains formed large swarm rings. the deletion strains Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  and Δ2– <dig> did not show any swarming. Δ <dig> cells produced swarm rings, but of a reduced size.

reduced or impaired ring formation on swarm plates can be due to defects in signal transduction or flagellar motility. in order to determine the defects of the deletion strains, their swimming ability was evaluated by microscopy, and the frequency of reversal of their swimming direction was measured with a computer-based cell-tracking system . this system automatically determines the rate of reversing cells over a certain observation time  <cit> .

visual inspection clearly demonstrated that all deletion strains were motile without detectable swimming defects. the wild type strains showed in a  <dig> s observation interval a reversal rate of 10%  and 25%  in the unstimulated state. upon stimulation with a blue light flash or orange light step down , wild type cells responded effectively with reversal rates of 70–80%.

in the strains Δ <dig> and Δ2– <dig>  very low reversal rates of up to 5% were measured, both spontaneous and after stimulation. these strains displayed a smooth-swimming phenotype with hardly any switching. similar results were obtained for the Δ <dig> strains. the reversal rates for three of the Δ <dig> clones were slightly higher than the estimated tracking error of 5%, but this may have been due to the low number of cells evaluated for these clones, which is also reflected by the broader confidence intervals. a significant increase of reversals after repellent stimulation could not be detected, indicating that this deletion has disabled the response to repellent stimuli. it leads to a strongly reduced switching frequency or even also to a smooth-swimming phenotype.

for Δ <dig>  no significant difference was visible compared to wild type cells, either with or without photophobic stimulation.

Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  and the double deletion Δ2– <dig> show almost 100% cw rotational bias
to further characterize the defects of the deletion strains, the flagellar rotational bias was investigated by dark-field microscopy  <cit> . these measurements were taken only with the s <dig> strains and, except for Δ <dig>  only one clone for each deletion was analyzed because the results were in complete agreement with the other phenotypic findings. the two s9Δ <dig> clones were investigated because they showed a slightly different phenotype in the phototaxis measurements .

the numbers of cells observed swimming forward  rotating flagella) and backward  rotating flagella) are shown in table  <dig>  wildtype cells showed a distribution between forward and backward swimming of close to 50: <dig>  as expected  <cit> . cells of the deletion strain Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  and the double deletion Δ2– <dig>  showed a bias toward forward swimming of almost 100%. the slight discrepancy of both s9Δ <dig> clones found in the cell tracking assay also showed up in this experiment, proving the reliability of the applied methods. Δ <dig> cells exhibited a rotational distribution of nearly 50: <dig>  similar to wildtype.

the flagellar rotational direction was analyzed by dark-field microscopy. cells with clockwise  rotating flagella are pushed forward by their right-handed flagellar bundle, whereas cells with counterclockwise  rotating flagella are pulled backward  <cit> . the flagella and the direction of movement of the cell can be seen under the dark-field microscope and thus the rotational direction be determined. shown is the number of cells in cw and ccw swimming mode at the time point of observation, as well as the percentage of cw swimming cells.

the deletion phenotypes are not caused by inhibited expression of che and fla proteins
to rule out the possibility that the observed phenotypes are caused by altered che or fla gene expression levels, quantitative realtime reverse transcription pcr  was applied . the genes of the che operon as well as the fla genes ce, f, g, h, i, j are cotranscribed  <cit> , so not all genes needed to be analyzed separately. cher and chey were chosen for analysis because cher is at the border of the che operon, next to the deleted genes, and chey was an additional control. chec <dig> and chew <dig>  which are not located in the che operon, were not tested separately, because the deletion of these genes does not cause a smooth-swimming phenotype . additionally, flah was chosen as a representative of the fla genes, although a defect in fla protein expression seemed a priori unlikely since no motility defect was observed.

the mrna levels in the deletions in s <dig> were determined by qrt-pcr. given is the fold difference in the mrna level of the deletions compared to s <dig> wildtype. each result is the average of two replicates.

the qrt-pcr curves were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔct

complementation of the deletion strains reverted their phenotype to that of wildtype
all deletions in the s <dig> background were complemented by reintroducing the deleted gene in cis. the phenotype of the complementations was examined by swarm plates and, for the single deletions, by motion analysis. in these assays, all complementations behaved exactly like the wild-type strain , confirming that the phenotypes observed in the mutants were a direct result of their gene deletions.

bioinformatics analysis
to collect information on the three unknown proteins and to test if the findings obtained in h. salinarum are potentially transferable to other archaeal species, a bioinformatics analysis was done. the starting point was a homology search and querying databases like cog  <cit>  and pfam  <cit> . the goal was to identify orthologs from other organisms for which some knowledge might exist, and to unravel correlations between the occurrence of the here investigated proteins and che and fla proteins. for this, an extensive search for che and fla orthologs in all published archaeal genomes was performed .

oe2401f is classified as a heat_pbs or heat family protein  <cit> . these proteins are predicted to contain short bi-helical repeats. beside the heat-like repeats, no other domain could be detected. in the cog database, oe2401f is identified as member of the fog  cog <dig>  described to contain heat repeat proteins. this cog belongs to the functional category c, "energy production and conversion". no functional information for this cog is given.

the repeats in the protein sequence of oe2401f led to a high number of non-significant matches in database searches. thus it was not possible to identify a reliable set of orthologs from other organisms, and no conclusions about co-occurrence of this protein family with che or fla genes could be drawn. close homologs were identified in the che and fla gene regions of the halophilic archaea n. pharaonis and h. marismortui. these homologs are, like in h. salinarum, adjacent to a duf <dig> gene. additionally, proteins with heat-like repeats are present in all sequenced haloarchaeal genomes  in other genomic context. for none of these proteins could any functional knowledge be obtained.

homologs of oe2402f and oe2404r are found generally and exclusively in archaeal che gene regions
oe2402f and oe2404r are annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins. they are homologous to each other and belong to the protein family duf <dig>  <cit>  and to the cluster of orthologous groups cog <dig>  duf <dig> is described as "archaeal protein of unknown function", and cog <dig> as "uncharacterized conserved protein".

homology searches showed that no members of the family duf <dig> can be found outside the domain archaea. among the archaea, the presence of such a gene strictly correlated with the presence of che genes . the only exceptions were methanocaldococcus jannaschii, which does not possess che genes but has a duf <dig> homolog, and methanosarcina barkeri, that has che genes but no duf <dig>  examination of the genomic context revealed that the duf <dig> genes are always located in the chemotaxis gene regions . the exceptions were two of the four paralogs in h. marismortui. in  <dig> out of  <dig> species the duf <dig> gene is adjacent to chey.

the only archaeal che gene regions without a duf <dig> homolog are the che <dig> regions of the methanosarcina species. in methanosarcina barkeri this is the only che region, as this species does not contain the part of the genome where the che <dig> region in m. mazei and m. acetivorans is located  <cit> . the che gene region of m. barkeri is peculiar in that it has lost chec, which is present in all other archaeal che regions.

a multiple alignment of all members of the family duf <dig> revealed only few conserved residues and several weakly conserved regions . no conserved motif could be detected that could provide a clue to the function of these proteins. it is noteworthy that in comparison to the other species the protein from methanocaldococcus jannaschii  is less conserved and truncated at the c-terminus.

two or more copies of duf <dig> proteins were only found in the motile haloarchaea h. salinarum, n. pharaonis, and h. marismortui. all three species contain a second homolog in or adjacent to the che gene region . these second homologs lack several residues conserved in all other proteins of the family duf <dig> , and probably fulfill a different function than the main group of duf <dig> proteins. this is consistent with the phenotypic results obtained for the deletions: the deletion of oe2404r resulted, other than the deletion of oe2402f, only in a weak phenotype. phylogenetic analysis  revealed that the second homologs in the che gene region of the haloarchaea  form a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree, indicating that they probably arose by a gene duplication prior to the divergence of the haloarchaea. h. marismortui contains two additional duf <dig> homologs located apart from the che gene region. these two paralogs resemble more the main group of duf <dig> proteins than the second homolog of the haloarchaea, as can be seen in the multiple alignment and the phylogenetic tree. if they also fulfill a function in taxis signaling, it remains elusive.

discussion
oe2401f, oe2402f, and oe2404r build a link between the che system and the flagellar apparatus
protein-protein interaction analysis in h. salinarum identified the proteins oe2401f, oe2402f, and oe2404r as interaction partners of the chemotaxis proteins chey, ched, and chec <dig>  as well as the flagella accessory proteins flace and flad. the function of the flagellar accessory proteins is not known but their critical role in flagellation has been demonstrated  <cit> . the flae part of flace is homologous to flad, both proteins contain a flad/e domain  <cit> . in methanococcus maripaludis, the deletion of flac resulted in non-motile and non-flagellated cells  <cit> . deletion of flace and flad in h. salinarum resulted in cells with a reduced number of flagella, which are hardly  or not  motile  <cit> . thus, Δflace cells  most likely have defects both in flagellar assembly and in flagellar function. these findings were interpreted as indicating that flac, flace, and flad either function in flagellar secretion and assembly or that they are part of the flagellar motor or related structures. as mentioned in  <cit> , in crenarchaeal genomes the genes flac-e are generally absent  although several crenarchaeal species are known to possess functional flagella, making a function assignment for these proteins even more difficult. however, in no crenarchaeal genome have che genes been detected , and we are not aware of any study reporting that a crenarchaeote reverses the flagellar rotational direction. temperature-sensitive motility is described for sulfolobus acidocaldarius  <cit> , but this organism achieves reorientation by briefly halting its flagella and not by reversals  <cit> . this fact, and the connection to the response regulator chey via the proteins identified in this study suggest that flac-e might be components of the flagellar motor or associated structures and might be involved in flagellar motor switching.

in bacteria, the link between the che system and the flagellar motor is built by the interaction of chey-p with the flagellar motor switch protein flim. the archaeal flagellar motor is built from different components and driven by atp instead of proton influx  <cit> , but its overall function is the same.

accordingly, it can be speculated that oe2401f, oe2402f, and oe2404r are either part of the archaeal flagellar motor switch, or they are adapters which fit the bacterial-like che system to the yet unidentified archaeal switch.

oe2401f, oe2402f, and oe2404r also interact with ched, and oe2402f and oe2404r with chec <dig>  in b. subtilis, chec is a chey-p phosphatase localized at the signaling complex  <cit> . ched deamidates glutamine residues of the receptors and is necessary for receptor activation of chea  <cit> . together, these proteins build a feedback loop from the output of the system to the receptors  <cit> . besides chec, b. subtilis expresses with fliy a second chey-p phosphatase, which is localized at the flagellar motor switch  <cit> . generally, phosphatase localization turns out to be a conserved and important principle in bacterial chemotaxis systems  <cit> . in h. salinarum, receptor deamidase activity was demonstrated for the cheb protein, but not detected for ched  <cit>  and the cellular role of ched and the three checs is unknown. however, provided that oe2402f and oe2404r are part of or related to the flagellar motor switch, the interaction with chec <dig> might reflect chey-p phosphatase localization similar to b. subtilis. chec <dig> would then fulfill the role of fliy, and one or both of the other checs the role of b. subtilis chec. altogether, the protein interaction data are not sufficient to functionally characterize oe2401f, oe2402f, and oe2404r, but they provide strong evidence that these proteins act between the che system and the archaeal flagellar apparatus.

without oe2401f and oe2402f the che system and the flagellum are decoupled
the phenotypic characteristics of the deletion strains  demonstrated that oe2401f and oe2402f are essential for the ability to control the direction of flagellar rotation, whereas the role of oe2404r remained unclear. the Δ <dig> strains were not distinguishable from wildtype strains in the phototaxis measurement and with respect to the flagellar rotational bias, but produced significantly smaller swarm rings. hence, while it can be said that oe2404r is involved in taxis signal transduction in h. salinarum, it either fulfills a non-essential function or it can be replaced by its homolog, oe2402f, with only minor constraints.

cells of the strains Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  Δ2– <dig> displayed very weak or no spontaneous switching, they did not respond to repellent light stimulation, and were unable to form swarm rings. they rotated their flagella almost exclusively clockwise. none of the strains exhibited defects in flagellar motility. hence they behaved exactly like chey and chea deletion strains  <cit> .

the data suggest that without oe2401f or oe2402f the che system and the flagellum are decoupled. this could occur if either the che system cannot generate its output, chey-p, or if chey-p is present but not effective. the first of these two possibilities seems less likely because the ppi data suggest a role for oe2401f and oe2402f between chey and the flagellum, and not upstream of chey. additionally, the homology of the che system to bacteria argues against the first hypothesis: our current understanding is that the che system of h. salinarum, with the ten known che proteins, is complete up to chey-p. only for the part downstream of chey-p have no homologs to bacterial proteins been found.

a further possibility to explain the behavior of Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  Δ2– <dig> is an influence of the deleted proteins on the switch factor fumarate, which might act independently of the che system. a defect in fumarate signaling can cause a phenotype similar to the one observed for Δ <dig>  Δ <dig>  Δ2– <dig>  <cit> . however, the detected protein interactions with chey provide strong evidence that the proteins examined here play a role in the action of chey and not exclusively in fumarate switching.

oe2401f and oe2402f act cooperatively
bioinformatics analysis did not reveal much knowledge for oe2401f. the ppi data suggest that oe2401f and oe2402f act cooperatively to perform their function. this idea is also supported by the genomic location of oe2401f and its homologs in the haloarchaeal che gene regions, where it is always adjacent to a duf <dig> protein. however, in the chemotaxis gene regions of other archaeal species no homologs of oe2401f were found. hence it remains to be investigated if these proteins are restricted to haloarchaea, or if similar proteins, coded elsewhere in the genome, play a role in taxis signaling also in other archaeal species.

oe2402f and oe2404r belong to a family of archaea-specific che proteins
the proteins oe2402f and oe2404r belong to the protein family duf <dig>  <cit> . proteins of this family were found to be an integral part of archaeal chemotaxis gene regions; they were not detected in other genomic contexts. the duf <dig> gene is adjacent to chey in  <dig> of  <dig> che gene regions, which supports the interaction found between these proteins  <cit> .

the only archaeal chemotaxis gene regions without a duf <dig> protein are the che <dig> regions of the three methanosarcina species. although these species are described as non-motile  <cit> , they probably have the capability to swim by flagella since their genomes contain flagellins and a complete set of fla genes . whether the methanosarcina che <dig> region plays a role in controlling flagellar motility and, if so, how this is done without duf <dig> protein, remains to be elucidated.

among the archaea with published genome sequences, methanocaldococcus jannaschii is the only species which codes for a duf <dig>  but not for che proteins. however, the protein from methanocaldococcus jannaschii is less conserved and truncated at the c-terminus while this is well conserved in all other species. hence it is likely that this protein is either non-functional or fulfills a different function.

the presence of a duf <dig> protein in  all archaeal che gene regions and the restriction to this genomic context indicate that these proteins constitute a hitherto unrecognized family of archaeal chemotaxis proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the ppi data and the observed deletion phenotypes strongly support a model where, in h. salinarum, chey-p cannot trigger flagellar motor switching without oe2401f and oe2402f. bioinformatics analysis has demonstrated that proteins of the duf <dig> family are not only essential for chemo- and phototaxis in h. salinarum, but comprise a family of general archaeal chemotaxis proteins. the che proteins in archaea were identified by homology to their bacterial counterparts  <cit> , so the absence of duf <dig> in bacteria might explain why these proteins were not recognized earlier. since the archaeal chemotaxis proteins identified in this study connect the chemotaxis system to the archaeal flagellum, we propose the name chef for this protein family. future experiments will be necessary to determine the exact role of chef in archaeal flagellar motor switching.
