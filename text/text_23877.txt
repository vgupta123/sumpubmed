BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas which bind to mrnas to regulate protein expression, either by blocking translation and/or by promoting degradation of the mrna target , or alternatively by increasing translation  <cit> . they have been found to be involved in numerous functions such as cell fate determination, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell death . profiles of mirnas in various types of tumors have been shown to contain potential diagnostic and prognostic information . the number of known mirnas has rapidly increased in recent years, and currently there are  <dig> human mirna sequences reported in the sanger institute's mirna database release  <dig>    <cit> , with potentially many more yet to be reported  <cit> .

several methods for global mirna profiling are currently in common use. these include quantitative rt-pcr  involving stem-loop rt primers combined with taqman pcr  analysis  <cit> , qpcr with locked nucleic acid primers   <cit> , qpcr using poly tailing   <cit> , high-throughput sequencing of small rna libraries  <cit> , and microarray analysis . typical experimental workflows often involve using different methods of measuring mirnas at different research stages. for this reason, it is important to know how well the different measurements agree with each other. several groups have compared microarray profiling results with those obtained by quantitative pcr for either a small number of genes or a small set of samples  <cit> ; however there has been no systematic comparison of larger numbers of mirnas across a widely diverse range of human tissues using the two methods.

in this study, we compared the relative expression of  <dig> different mirnas across nine different human tissues, measured using both agilent mirna microarrays and taqman qpcr. the agilent microarray platform features the direct end-labeling and profiling of mature mirnas from total rna without any size fractionation or amplification to minimize experimental loss, bias, or variations  <cit> . the labeling reaction is performed under denaturing conditions to provide high labeling yield, minimal sequence bias  <cit> , and consistently reproducible efficiency for every mirna sequence  <cit> . by incorporating hairpin structures in the microarray probe, base-pairing with the additional nucleotide incorporated during labeling, and empirical melting point-determination, the platform is capable of single-nucleotide discrimination in the mirna sequences while specifically distinguishing the mature mirnas from longer rnas in the total rna sample  <cit> . we chose to compare this microarray system against the taqman qpcr system in particular, since at the time this work was performed this was the most commonly utilized mirna qpcr system. we found excellent correlation between the microarray and pcr results for most of the mirnas. we further examined two of the mirnas showing low correlations by using spiked-in synthetic rnas, and found that differential sensitivity between the two techniques is not the cause of the discrepancy.

another factor which could potentially affect the results of an mirna profiling study is the method used to isolate rna from the biological sample. both the agilent microarray system and the taqman qpcr systems use total rna as the starting material; however, it is unclear whether different total rna preparation methods will yield systematically different mirna profiling results. in this report, we compared the results of mirna microarray profiling obtained with three different commonly used total rna prep methods. we found that the results for most mirnas were equivalent among the different sample preparation methods, but that measured levels of a small number of mirnas differed systematically.

RESULTS
quantitative rt-pcr and agilent microarray mirna profiles correlate strongly
we previously reported that a comparison of agilent microarray profiling and sybr green-based quantitative rt-pcr  of ten mirnas in seven different human tissues found the two measurements correlated quite well  <cit> . to perform a more extensive comparison, we analyzed the expression of  <dig> human mirnas in nine different tissues , using both agilent mirna microarrays and taqman stem-loop qrt-pcr  <cit> . aliquots of the same rna samples were used for both the microarray and qpcr measurements. we chose these particular  <dig> mirnas for several reasons. first, they represent a wide range of expression levels, as determined in an initial array analysis of some of the tissues. second, they have wide differences in gc content, ranging from 23%  to 68% . third, we chose several mirnas which had potentially problematic sequences or exhibited atypical behavior during the development of the agilent microarray platform: two of these did not show as good a linear titration curve as other mirnas tested in a previous study   <cit> , and two other mirnas were previously reported not to be labeled by enzymatic methods similar  to that used with the agilent microarray assay   <cit> .

of the  <dig> mirnas examined, only mir- <dig> was not detected by either method in any of the tissues. the rest of the mirnas assayed were detected in most or all of the tissues by both methods, with two exceptions: mir- <dig>  expressed only in the heart  <cit>  and at very low levels in skeletal muscle, and mir- <dig>  expressed in the brain, and at lower levels in placenta and thymus .

the qpcr and microarray results were compared by plotting the qpcr cycle threshold  value versus the log <dig> of the array signal for each mirna in all nine tissues . these two values should be directly comparable, since both the qpcr ct value and the log <dig> of the microarray signal change by a value of  <dig> for every 2-fold change in mirna concentration. if the qpcr and microarray measurements are equivalent, the plots will show a linear correlation  with a slope of - <dig>  figure  <dig> shows the slopes and the correlation values for each of the  <dig> mirnas.  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas show correlation values  between - <dig>  and - <dig> , and 50/ <dig> plots have slopes between - <dig>  and - <dig> . of the four mirnas which were selected as potentially problematic in the microarray measurements, only mir- <dig> did not correlate between the microarray and qpcr assays; mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-126* all gave excellent correlations.

to examine the results for all  <dig> mirnas on one plot, we cannot simply plot qpcr ct values versus microarray signals for all mirnas in all tissues, because both the qpcr and microarray assays have differential sensitivities to different mirnas. thus, instead of looking at absolute expression levels, we must look at relative ratios of mirna expression between two different tissues. to judge the consistency of fold-changes measured by microarray and qpcr platforms, we plotted the ratios of mirna expression between all  <dig> possible pairs of tissues as measured by qpcr -ct) and by microarrays -log2). four such plots are shown in figure  <dig> , while figure  <dig> shows the slopes and r values for each of the plots for the  <dig> tissue pairs. the plots all show very good correlation between the qpcr and array ratios, with r values between - <dig>  and - <dig> . the slopes of the  <dig> plots vary between - <dig>  and - <dig> . the intercepts of these fold-change plots  indicate the consistency between fold-changes measured by the two methods. the mean of the intercepts of the line fits for the  <dig> tissue pairs was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>   . this level of variability  is comparable to that seen among independent measurements using the same technique.

measurements of spike-ins of mirnas which systematically differ between platforms show linear sensitivity
mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-99a are the three mirnas that exhibit the most discrepant correlation values and slopes between the qpcr and microarray assays ; however, if the measurement of mir-99a in placenta is omitted, the slope for this mirna becomes - <dig>  with r = - <dig>  . for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  if one platform were measuring levels of these mirnas accurately, while the other platform were not, then we might expect a significant divergence from linearity to be observed between the two measurements when adding increasing amounts of synthetic mir- <dig> or mir- <dig> rna into a total rna sample. to test this, we added  <dig> zmol to  <dig> fmols of synthetic mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> rnas to  <dig> ng of total rna from liver or placenta, and measured the qpcr and microarray responses . for both mirnas, in both tissues, the relation between qpcr measurement and array measurement is linear above a threshold spike-in concentration. the r values of the linear regions are very close to - <dig>  with slopes between - <dig>  and - <dig> , indicating that both the qpcr and the microarrays are producing sample-responsive and internally consistent measurements of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> at these concentration levels. below the threshold spike-in levels, the qpcr ct values and microarray signals are unchanged for mir- <dig>  while for mir- <dig> the ct values increase slightly, but the array measurements are unchanged. we conclude that the difference between the two platforms is not due to different sensitivity, since both the microarray and qpcr measurements are capable of measuring mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> accurately above a spike-in concentration threshold. presumably some type of interference confounds the measurement of endogenous expression levels in the complex sample, on one or both of the platforms.

three different total rna preparation methods show similar yields and quality
a question which arises when comparing the mirna profiling results reported in different studies is whether the methods used to isolate rna from tissue or cell line samples systematically affect the mirna profiles. to examine whether the mirna profile of a sample is affected by the type of total rna prep method used, we prepared one large frozen cell pellet from each of two different human cell lines, hela  and zr-75- <dig> . we then subdivided these pellets into equal aliquots, and performed total rna isolation on the aliquots using three different techniques: phenol/guanidinium  followed by isopropanol precipitation, and two column-based techniques, mirneasy  and mirvana . four to eleven replicate preps were performed on each cell type with each method.

mean rna yields, as measured by absorbance at  <dig> nm, and quality metrics for each prep type are shown in table  <dig>  the rna integrities of the preps were analyzed on the agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer, and all the preps had high quality rna according to the rin number  <cit> . this indicates that most of the rnas in the various preps were intact, with minimal breakdown. however, rin values do not provide information about non-rna contaminants, such as organic reagents and dna. the trizol preps showed the lowest mean 260/ <dig> ratios, possibly indicating the presence of some remaining trizol reagent in the final product.

the number of individual preps performed using the indicated total rna prep method and cell lines are shown, as are the mean and standard deviations  of the total rna yields , 260: <dig> ratios, 260: <dig> ratios, and rin numbers for all the preps done with the same method in each cell type. preps started with either  <dig> ×  <dig> cells  or  <dig> ×  <dig> cells .

since the absorbance at  <dig> nm is used to quantitate the amount of rna for use in the measurement assays, and since the 260: <dig> ratios can only serve as a crude guideline to possible contaminants, it is important to examine the absorption spectra in more detail . some of the spectra clearly show the presence of additional peaks between 220– <dig> nm, indicating the presence of contaminant. while this is most consistently seen in the trizol preps, it is also sometimes seen in the mirvana preps and in one of the mirneasy preps. in some of the samples where no distinct peak is observed between 220– <dig> nm, the spectra show significant absorbance in the wavelengths immediately below  <dig> nm, with a shoulder tailing from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm. at  <dig> nm the absorption increases again to peak at around  <dig> nm, which is the wavelength of maximum absorption for nucleic acids of mixed oligonucleotide composition. for many of these spectra, this absorption pattern suggests that the absorbance of the contaminant whose peak is below  <dig> nm may overlap with the nucleic acid absorbance peak at  <dig> nm, which would result in the overestimation of nucleic acid quantity as determined by the absorption at  <dig> nm. also, a couple of the absorbance spectra show a slight shoulder in the 260– <dig> nm range, indicating a contaminant which could also affect rna quantitation. thus, careful examination of sample spectra can be important for identifying samples where measured mirna levels might be compromised by absorbance-based rna quantitation artifacts.

variability of hybridization results is highest between different prep methods
for mirna microarray profiling analysis we took three of the replicate total rna preps of each different prep method in each cell type and hybridized them to agilent mirna microarrays. a total of  <dig> hybridizations were done, with all but two samples hybridized at least twice .

a good measure of the reproducibility of replicate measurements is the root mean square  deviation of the natural logs of all signals that are well above background levels. the rms deviation is approximately equal to the coefficient of variation of signals, and is an estimate of the proportional error of the measurement. for example, if the rms deviation is  <dig>  , then a measured fold change between samples of  <dig>  is a difference of one standard deviation.

we compared the rms deviations between pairs of hybridizations performed using the same total rna prep  with those performed using different total rna preps done with the same method , and also with those using different total rna prep methods. we also compared hybridizations performed on the same or different days, in order to take into account any day-to-day variability in the results. figure 7a shows box plots of the rms deviations between all possible replicate hybridization pairs, categorized by same or different prep method, same or different prep replicate, same or different hybridization replicate, and same or different hybridization day. the box plots for the six different categories are shown in decreasing order of variability. hybridizations using preps from different methods show the most variability, with same day hybs of the different prep methods showing slightly less variability than different day hybs. replicate preparations using the same method are the next lowest in variability, again with same day hybs being less variable than different day hybs. finally, hybs done with aliquots of the same preparation have the lowest variability, again with same day hybs being less variable than different day hybs. the three sources of variability can thus be put in order of their magnitude: different prep methods > different preps using the same method > different hybridization day.

we also plotted the rms deviations for hybridizations involving prep replicate pairs from each of the three different prep methods , in order to examine whether the different prep methods showed different amounts of variation between prep replicates . the trizol prep replicates showed less variability than the other two prep methods. a student's t-test between pair-wise comparisons of the three prep methods confirmed that this difference is statistically significant . there was no significant difference in variability between the mirvana and mirneasy prep replicates.

a small subset of mirnas differ between prep methods
to examine whether there are systematic differences among the mirna profiles observed for rna isolated by different methods, we first looked at the overall signal levels of the hybridizations. the grand means of the mean total gene signal for all hybridizations of the same prep type for each cell line are shown in table  <dig>  for both cell types, the mirneasy preps gave about 25% higher overall signals than the other two prep methods. the overall signal differences between the trizol and mirvana preps of the same cell type were minimal. it should be noted that the mirneasy preps had the highest 260: <dig> ratios , and their spectra generally showed lower absorbance in the 220– <dig> nm range compared to the other two prep types. it is possible that some of the material which is absorbing at 220– <dig> nm in rna extracted using the other two methods is contributing to the  <dig> nm peak, and it is also possible that dna contaminants are present. the presence of either or both types of contaminant can lead to an overestimation of the amount of rna present in these preps.

the mean of the total gene signal for all the mirnas on the microarray were calculated for each individual hybridization, and the mean and standard deviation of these for each prep type in each cell line are shown.

we next examined whether specific mirnas systematically differ among the different prep methods . we calculated an average expression profile for each prep method for the two cell lines, by first averaging the total gene signals for each mirna from all hybridizations of the same rna prep, and then averaging together these individual prep averages for all preps of the same prep and cell type. since there were differences seen in the overall signal levels between the different preps , we normalized each pair-wise comparison to the 75th percentile of one of the pairs. the expression profile of most mirnas in hela cells does not depend on the rna prep method . however, there is a small subset of mirnas that consistently report different relative expression levels depending on the prep method. the mirnas that are labeled in the figure show expression levels that differ by at least 2-fold in different prep methods. additional file  <dig> lists the mirnas which are  <dig> x and 2x higher in one prep type compared to another. three mirnas are found at consistently lower levels in trizol preps than in the other two preps: mir-29b, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  mirvana preps show consistently higher levels of four mirnas when compared to the other two hela preps: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  figure  <dig>  shows the results from the zr-75- <dig> breast cell line. while fewer mirnas show different profiles among the three different prep methods in this cell line compared to hela, four out of the five that are observed to be discrepant in zr-75- <dig> cells are the same as those seen in hela cells .

the finding that a small number of mirnas report different microarray signals when prepared by different methods raises the question of whether these differences reflect real differences in the concentrations of these mirnas in the different sample preps. to examine this, we assayed individual samples prepared with the three methods by qpcr, using primers for three of the mirnas showing differences between the prep methods. we then compared these results to those obtained from microarray analysis of the same preps . the good agreement of the qpcr results with the array results for these mirnas strongly suggests that the differences in the mirna levels observed between the sample prep methods reflect true differences in the mirna content of the extracted rna, and are not artifacts of the measurement assay. at present, we have no explanation for why these particular mirnas are found at different levels when using different extraction techniques.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we compared the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas in nine human tissues as measured by both agilent microarrays and taqman qrt-pcr. we found that 53/ <dig> expressed mirnas had correlations  >  <dig>  between the two methods. for the two mirnas that differed most between the two methods, spike-in studies found the differences are not due to differential sensitivity of the two methods, but are more likely due to interference from other rnas in the complex mixture.

we also examined microarray-based mirna profiles using three different total rna sample prep methods. we found that while almost all mirna levels correspond between the three different prep methods, a small subset of 2– <dig> mirnas consistently differ by greater than 2-fold between different techniques. these differences were corroborated using qpcr, and are most likely due to true differences in the mirna content of the extracted rna. thus, while all three methods are suitable for use in profiling mirnas from total rna, it may be prudent to pick one method and use it for the entire course of any particular study, in order to avoid these small profile differences due to the rna preparation method.
