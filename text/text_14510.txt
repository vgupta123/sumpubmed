BACKGROUND
aflatoxins  are a group of polyketide metabolites produced by several toxigenic species of aspergillus such as a. flavus and a. parasiticus after infections of seeds with high protein and lipid contents, e.g. peanut, corn and walnut  <cit> . afs are toxic and carcinogenic, posing serious threats to both animal and human health  <cit> . extensive studies carried out in a. flavus and a. parasiticus lead to the identification of a 70 kb dna cluster consisting two specific transcriptional regulators , and  <dig> co-regulated downstream metabolic genes in the af biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . expressions of aflr and afls are further regulated by global regulators such as the crea transcription factor and the velb/vea/laea complex, and possibly by a cell surface-localized g-protein coupled receptor complex  <cit> .

various nutritional and environmental factors including carbon sources  <cit> , nitrate  <cit> , light  <cit> , temperature  <cit> , ph  <cit> , and oxygen availability  <cit>  affect af productions and expressions of af biosynthesis-related genes  <cit> . it has been known for a long time that sugars and related carbohydrates support both fungal growth and af production. however, peptone, a mixture of protein degradation products, is a preferred carbon source for fungal growth, but not for af production  <cit> . many studies have been carried out to elucidate how various carbon sources affect af biosynthesis. transition from peptone mineral salts  medium to glucose mineral salts  medium leads to af biosynthesis, a process requiring de novo transcription and translation  <cit> . comparisons of a large collection of carbon sources reveal that sugars that are normally oxidized through the hexose monophosphate or glycolytic pathway such as glucose, raffinose and mannose are efficient carbon sources for af productions  <cit> , while lactose and most amino acids excluding aspartate are considered to be unsuitable carbon sources for af production  <cit> . afs are usually produced in parallel with fatty acid biosynthesis following the rapid growth and sugar utilization phase, as common precursors such as acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa derived from glucose catabolism are utilized in both pathways  <cit> . as many carbohydrates are able to induce af production, abdollahi and buchanan  believe that utilization of readily metabolized carbohydrates may result in elevated energy status which in turn induces af biosynthesis  <cit> . wiseman and buchanan  note that, although mycelia grow well in media with low concentrations of suitable sugars, afs are produced only when sugar concentrations are higher than  <dig>  m, and in which reduced mycelial growth and inhibited tca cycle activity are observed  <cit> . addition of tca cycle intermediates inhibits af production, suggesting that glucose may regulate af productions through inhibition of the tca cycle  <cit> . recent studies have revealed cell density-dependent sclerotium formation and af production in media with glucose and sorbitol as the carbohydrate sources, which is regulated through non-cell autonomous factors  <cit> .

in nature, seeds with high protein and lipid content, such as peanut and cotton, are more susceptible to high af production than starchy seeds like rice and sorghum  <cit> . it has also been shown in maize that mycelial growth and af production occur primarily in the embryo and the aleurone layer where mainly storage proteins and lipids are accumulated  <cit> . removal of oil from ground cotton seeds greatly enhances af production, suggesting that lipids are not essential for optimal af biosynthesis  <cit> . fatty acids may stimulate or inhibit af production through the presence of various oxidation-derived oxilipins  <cit> . the influence of protein and peptone on af biosynthesis remains largely unknown.

in this study we investigated how af production by aspergillus was influenced when peptone was used as the sole carbon source. contrary to expectations, we observed spore density- and peptone concentration-dependent af production with peptone as the sole carbon source. afs were only produced in the pms medium when initial spore densities were  <dig> spores/ml or lower. in contrast, mycelia cultured in the pms medium with higher initial spore densities or with increased peptone concentrations grew rapidly but without af production. spent media experiments showed that no inhibitory factors were released into the culture media. metabolomic analyses revealed that, in addition to inhibited af biosynthesis, mycelia grown in peptone media with high initial spore densities showed enhanced sugar utilization and repressed lipid biosynthetic metabolism.

RESULTS
spore density-dependent af production in pms media
pms has long been considered to be a non-conducive medium for af production in both a. flavus and a. parasiticus <cit> . to investigate the mechanism underlying peptone’s influence on af biosynthesis, the well-studied a. flavus a <dig>   <cit>  from the china general microbiological culture collection center  was used to conduct our experiments. it was indeed the case that a. flavus did not produce afs when cultured at the commonly employed initial spore density of  <dig> or  <dig> spores/ml. however, when various spore densities of a. flavus were tested to initiate cultures, a density-dependent af production was observed. when the initial spore density was gradually decreased, increasing amounts of afs were detected in media after 3-day culture, as shown by thin-layer chromatography  and high pressure liquid chromatography  analyses . at  <dig> spores/ml, the amount of afs produced was significantly lower, comparable to that of the  <dig> spores/ml culture. the maximal af production was observed in the pms medium inoculated with  <dig> spores/ml. this differs from gms cultures, where increasing amounts of afs were produced when initial spore densities were increased from  <dig> to  <dig> spores/ml . we also observed that in gms media, afb <dig> was the major toxin , while in pms media, afg <dig> was the primary toxin produced . these data suggest that af biosynthesis is regulated differentially in these two media.

since most a. flavus strains produce only afb <dig>  <cit> , we examined if the a <dig>  strain used was indeed a. flavus. by using the protocol developed by henry et al   <cit> , fragments of the internal transcribed spacer  region of rrnaβ-tubulin and calmodulin genes from the a. flavus a <dig>  strain were amplified and sequenced, and then compared with corresponding sequences in the genbank, and confirmed that a <dig>  is indeed a. flavus . it is very likely that the strain we used belongs to the type iv a. flavus, which produces both afbs and afgs, as reported recently  <cit> .

the time course of af production
to assess the production and possible degradation of afs during the cultural period with various initial spore densities, we examined afg <dig> contents in the pms medium during a five-day culture period, with  <dig> or  <dig> spores/ml. we observed that, in the culture initiated with  <dig> spores/ml, a significant amount of afg <dig> was detected on the day two, reached the maximum level on the day three, and subsequently decreased gradually. in contrast, almost no afs were detected in the culture initiated with  <dig> spores/ml during the entire five-day culture period . it has been shown previously that peptone from different suppliers may induce different enzyme activities in candida albicans <cit> . the peptone initially used in this study was purchased from beijing aoboxing biotech. to ensure the result observed is a general phenomenon, peptone from sigma and shuangxuan microbe culture medium products factory was tested, and same results were observed .

to examine if cultures with high initial spore densities lead to a similar af accumulation in mycelia, we used the tlc method to analyze af contents in mycelia cultured for three days in either pms or gms media, with  <dig> or  <dig> spores/ml. the results showed greatly reduced af content in mycelia in culture initiated with  <dig> spores/ml, similar to the af content of the media. in contrast, increased af production was observed in mycelia cultured in gms media with  <dig> spores/ml, as compared to that with  <dig> spores/ml .

high initial spore density in pms media led to rapid mycelial growth
to exclude the possibility that the reduced af production in pms media initiated with high initial spore densities was caused by inhibited fungal growth, mycelium dry weights were determined during a five-day culture period. a. flavus cultured in gms media with an initial density of  <dig> or  <dig> spores/ml showed a similar growth curve, with a continuous increase in dry weight during the five-day incubation. higher initial spore density led to slightly faster mycelial growth, and an increased mycelium dry weight . a. flavus cultured with  <dig> spores/ml in pms media showed a similar growth curve to that in gms media with the same spore density . however, a much sharper exponential growth phase was observed in the first two days in pms culture initiated with  <dig> spores/ml . the mycelium dry weight reached the maximum level on the 4th day and decreased significantly afterwards, suggesting no inhibition of growth in the high density pms culture. instead, a. flavus cultured in pms media with a high initial spore density grew faster and degenerated earlier .

no inhibitory factor was released from the high density culture into the media
we examined whether inhibitory factors were released into the media by a. flavus grown in pms media with high initial spore densities. the experiment was performed by adding filter-sterilized spent media collected from 3-day cultures with  <dig> or  <dig> spores/ml to fresh gms media inoculated with  <dig> spores/ml. filter-sterilized fresh pms or gms media were used as controls. the addition of 1 ml fresh pms medium  to gms cultures enhanced production of both afb <dig> and afg <dig>  as compared to the addition of fresh gms medium  , which is in agreement with a previous report  <cit> . as showed in figure 2c, addition of 1 ml spent media from both high  and low  density cultures to the gms culture promoted af production. no significant difference in af production was observed in the high density culture. the experiment was extended further to add 5 ml spent media from high  and low  density cultures. if inhibiting factors were present in the spent media, we would expect to see reduced af productions when compared to addition of 1 ml spent media. however, we observed that more afs were produced in both p <dig> and p <dig> cultures, and no significant difference was observed between p <dig> and p <dig> samples . lower levels of afs were produced in cultures with spent pms media than those with fresh pms media , which could be explained by nutrient consumption during the three-day incubations. these data together show that there seems to be no inhibitory factor released from the high density culture to the media.

increased peptone concentrations inhibited af production
to examine if the lack of af production in pms media with high initial spore densities is caused by rapid mycelial growth, and consequent depletion of nutrients, the peptone concentration in media from the original 5% was increased to 15% to see if af production could be restored. we observed, conversely, that mycelia cultured with increased peptone concentration showed greatly reduced af production, regardless of initial spore densities  . we then examined the mycelial growth in media with 5%, 10% and 15% peptone, and observed increased mycelium dry weights when the peptone concentrations were increased , suggesting that high concentrations of peptone promoted mycelial growth and at the same time inhibited af biosynthesis. for each of the peptone concentrations, it was observed that cultures with higher initial spore densities showed an increase in mycelial growth. taken together, these studies revealed that high concentrations of peptone promoted mycelial growths but inhibited af production, suggesting that a. flavus grown in the peptone medium is able to sense the peptone concentrations and is able to shift between fast growth and af production.

it has been reported previously that carbon sources affect the ph of culture media  <cit> . if af production in media correlates with the ph changes was examined during incubation. we found that, as reported by buchanan and lewis   <cit> , the ph of cultures in gms media was decreased , while ph of cultures in pms media was increased during the 55-hr cultures . higher initial spore density led to faster acidification or alkalization of the gms and pms media during the cultures, respectively . interestingly, we observed that when the peptone concentration was increased to 15%, the ph of the media increased in the same way as the 5% peptone media . af production was inhibited in the medium with 15% peptone, while af production was active in the medium with 5% peptone, which suggests no direct connection between af production and ph changes in our incubation system.

high initial spore densities in pms media repressed the expression of af biosynthesis-related genes
to further study how initial spore densities affect af production in a. flavus, expression of af biosynthesis-related genes was examined by quantitative reverse transcription pcr  in mycelia initiated with  <dig> or  <dig> spores/ml for two days. we observed that the expression levels of two transcriptional regulators , and three af biosynthesis genes  from the af biosynthesis gene cluster were substantially lower in mycelia initiated with  <dig> spores/ml, as compared to those initiated with  <dig> spores/ml . the differences were even more pronounced on the day three , suggesting transcriptional activation of af biosynthesis in cultures initiated with the low spore density. we noted that nada, which is involved in the conversion of afg <dig>  <cit> , showed increased expression in the culture initiated with  <dig> spores/ml, compared to those initiated with  <dig> spores/ml on the day three .

the density effect was present in most aspergillus strains tested
to elucidate if the density effect is a general phenomenon in af-producing strains, we obtained a. flavus nrrl  <dig>  a. parasiticus nrrl  <dig> and a. nomius nrrl  <dig> from the agricultural research service  culture collection in united states department of agriculture , and performed experiments in parallel with a. flavus a <dig> . fresh spore suspensions were prepared in the same way as for a. flavus a <dig> , and inoculated in pms or gms liquid media with initial spore densities from  <dig> spores/ml to  <dig> spores/ml. after three-day cultures, afs were extracted from media and analyzed by tlc. as shown in figure  <dig>  in gms media, all strains showed increased af productions when initial spore densities were increased from  <dig> to  <dig> spores/ml, excluding a. flavus nrrl  <dig>  as reported previously, only afb <dig> and afb <dig> were produced by a. flavus nrrl  <dig>  <cit> , while for all other strains afb <dig> and afg <dig> were the major afs produced.

in pms media, similar to what was showed above in a. flavus a <dig> , we observed that high initial spore densities inhibited af biosynthesis in a. parasiticus nrrl  <dig> and a. nomius nrrl  <dig>  especially when initial spore densities were  <dig> spores/ml or higher . however, no af biosynthesis was observed in a. flavus nrrl  <dig> in pms media, no matter the initial spore density. it seems somehow the a. flavus nrrl  <dig> strain has lost the density sensing machinery in evolution.

mycelia grown in pms media with high initial spore densities showed reduced tca cycle intermediates and fatty acid accumulations, but enhanced pp pathway products
to determine metabolic differences in a. flavus grown in pms media with high or low initial spore densities, metabolites in mycelia cultured for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 5 days were analyzed by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry  using methods described previously  <cit> . multi-variate analyses showed that mycelia inoculated with  <dig> spores/ml clustered separately from mycelia inoculated with  <dig> spores/ml, suggesting evident metabolic differences between these two cultures . striking differences in levels were observed in  <dig> metabolites on the 3rd day . in pms cultures initiated with  <dig> spores/ml, a condition without af production, the level of three tca cycle intermediates, namely malic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid, accumulated significantly less than those in cultures initiated with  <dig> spores/ml this suggests that the tca cycle was more active in the high density culture. similarly, levels of four fatty acids, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, were reduced in cultures initiated with the high spore density , indicating that fatty acid biosynthesis was generally inhibited in the high density culture. in contrast, many sugar metabolites including ribitol, glucopyranoside, gluconolactone-6-p, glycerol, butanediamine, ethylamine and galactose, were accumulated more in the high density cultures , suggesting that the pp pathway was active. in addition, nucleotides and compounds involved in amino acid metabolism were less abundant in cultures initiated with the high spore density , which may be the consequence of the rapid mycelial growth.

addition of tca cycle intermediates did not affect af biosynthesis
to test if reduced tca cycle intermediates in mycelia are the primary cause of reduced af biosynthesis in the high initial spore density culture, malic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid were added to the pms medium at the concentrations of  <dig>  mm or 5 mm, and  <dig>  or 5 mm nacl was added to the culture as a control, and then performed liquid incubation with the final spore densities of  <dig> or  <dig> per ml using freshly prepared a. flavus a <dig>  spore suspensions. tlc analyses were performed for afs extracted from the media. we observed that none of these treatments had any significant effect on af production. no af production was observed in any of the high initial spore density cultures . these results suggest that the inhibited af biosynthesis in high initial spore density cultures was unlikely caused by reduced levels of tca cycle intermediates.

discussion
as a group of highly toxic natural compounds, afs in nature are produced mainly in seeds with high lipid and protein content  <cit> . previous reports show that peptone is not a suitable carbon source for af production  <cit> . our present study demonstrates that peptone was in fact conducive for af production, as long as the initial spore density of a. flavus was reduced. mycelia grown in peptone media responded not only to the initial spore density, but also to peptone concentration. higher initial spore density and higher concentration of peptone inhibited af biosynthesis. we also showed that no af biosynthesis inhibitor was released into the media in the culture with the higher initial spore density. qrt-pcr analyses revealed that culture with a high initial spore density repressed expression of both the transcriptional regulators and the biosynthesis genes in the af pathway gene cluster. metabolomic studies showed that, in high density cultures, the tca cycle and pp pathway were active, while the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway was repressed.

spore density- and peptone concentration-dependent af biosynthesis in pms media
in nature, many organisms, especially fungal species, are able to produce compounds to suppress the growth of other organisms in their neighborhood  <cit> . regulated production of these compounds is expected to have physiological and ecological advantage for these organisms. it has been shown previously that lower glucose content supports fungal growth but not af accumulation, suggesting that the first priority of the fungus is growth when food availability is low  <cit> . in our study we observed that mycelia grown in peptone media showed spore density- and peptone concentration-dependent af production in a. flavus. high initial spore density or high peptone concentration promoted rapid mycelial growth without af biosynthesis, which may allow the fungus to prioritize propagation when the competition pressure is low, and when sufficient food is available. in contrast, active af productions were observed in cultures initiated with lower spore densities and lower concentrations of peptone. additional comparative studies using several af-producing strains including a. flavusa. parasiticus and a. nomius from the usda ars culture collection showed that the density-dependent af biosynthesis in pms media was present in all strains tested except a. flavus nrrl  <dig>  this particular strain did not produce any afs in pms media, as reported previously  <cit> . furthermore, a positive correlation between af production and initial spore density in gms media was also not observed for this strain, implicating a different regulation mechanism is evolved. in natural ecosystems where the self population density is low and food is scarce, af production may confer competitive advantages, through inhibition of the growth of other organisms. it would be interesting to examine if other fungal species also employ this survival strategy.

we showed that no soluble af biosynthesis inhibitor was released from the high spore density culture to media by using spent medium experiments, suggesting that a. flavus a <dig>  is somehow able to sense the population density and adjust their growth and af production through cell-autonomous machinery. unlike candidia albicans and dictyostelium, where density factors are diffusible to media  <cit> , we hypothesize that a. flavus may use a cell surface component to perceive such cultural density and nutrient signals. the possible role of g protein-mediated signaling  <cit>  in this process is worth exploring. alternatively, it has been reported that oxidative stress is a prerequisite for af production  <cit> . it is plausible that the rapid growth in pms media with high initial spore densities may lead to reduced intracellular oxygen availability and subsequently decreased oxidative stress, which could prevent af production. it will be interesting to examine why this density-sensing machinery is active only when peptone, not glucose, is used as the carbon source.

high initial spore densities repressed expression of af biosynthesis- related genes including afls and aflr
transferring a. parasiticus mycelia from pms to gms media resulted in af production, which is inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin d treatments, suggesting both de novo transcription and translation are required for af biosynthesis  <cit> . in this study, we observed that high initial spore densities promoted mycelial growth but inhibited af production, which is similar to the high temperature cultures in gms media where no afs are produced  <cit> . high temperature culture  specifically represses the expressions of af biosynthesis genes without affecting expression of the transcriptional regulators aflr and afls in the af pathway gene cluster  <cit> . however, we found that high initial density cultures inhibited the expression of both the transcriptional regulators  and downstream af biosynthesis genes simultaneously, suggesting a different manner of regulation. further study is needed to elucidate if the density-dependent af biosynthesis is regulated through antagonistic signaling pathways that coordinate vegetative growth, conidiation and af production  <cit> .

cultures with high initial spore densities in pms media trigger a metabolic shift from af production to sugar metabolism
although primary and secondary metabolism share common transcriptional and translational machinery, secondary metabolism often commences during idiophase, when normal growth and development have ceased  <cit> . the present study revealed a novel low cell density-dependent metabolic switch toward af production in a. flavus. we observed that the af and lipid biosynthesis were active in mycelia initiated with a low spore density in the pms medium. in contrast, the tca cycle was inhibited, as shown by the accumulation of tca cycle intermediates in low spore density cultures, which is in agreement with previous results showing that the tca cycle is repressed during active af biosynthesis, to allow a greater acetyl-coa shunt toward af biosynthesis  <cit> . by adding three tca cycle intermediates to cultures, we showed that increased tca cycle intermediates did not restore af biosynthesis in the high initial spore density culture, nor did additional tca cycle intermediates promote af biosynthesis in the low spore density culture, suggesting that the spore density-regulated af biosynthesis in the pms medium is not likely influenced by tca cycling directly. the enhanced tca cycling might be the consequences of inhibited af biosynthesis in the high spore density culture.

since af production shares a subset of biosynthetic steps with fatty acid metabolism, accumulation of afs and lipids often occur in parallel  <cit> . this parallel biosynthesis trend was observed in our metabolomic studies. all four fatty acids detected, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid, were accumulated in the low spore density culture, together with af biosynthesis. the density-dependent metabolic switch from active tca cycling in high initial spore density cultures to active af biosynthesis in low initial spore density cultures may represent a shift in metabolic priority that allows a. flavus to produce afs in the protein-rich environment only when its own population density is low.

CONCLUSIONS
our studies demonstrate that a. flavus grown in media with peptone as the carbon source is able to detect its own population density and nutrient availability, and is able to switch between fast growth and af production. high initial spore density or high peptone concentration led to rapid mycelial growth and inhibited af production, while low initial spore density or low peptone concentration promoted af biosynthesis. inhibited af biosynthesis in the high initial spore density culture was accompanied by active tca cycling and rapid mycelial growth. supplements of tca cycle intermediates did not restore af biosynthesis, suggesting the inhibited af biosynthesis was not caused by depletion of tca intermediates. our spent medium experiments showed that the density-sensing factor regulates af biosynthesis in a cell-autonomous manner. expression analyses showed that the density factor acts at the transcriptional level to regulate the expressions of both aflr and afls transcription regulators and downstream af biosynthesis genes. interestingly, most aspergillus strains including a. parasiticus and a. nomius tested were shown to be density-dependent af biosynthesis in pms media. only a. flavus nrrl  <dig> did not exhibit the density-dependent af biosynthesis, suggesting different regulation machinery is evolved in this strain. we believe that a cell density- or peptone availability-dependent metabolic switch may provide a. flavus with a competitive advantage in the natural ecosystem. whether or not the perception of population density and peptone availability are regulated through the same signaling pathway will require further study.
