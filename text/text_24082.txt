BACKGROUND
investigations of the bacterial 16s rrna genes play an essential role in the exploration of microbial diversity and bacterial taxonomy. the composition of bacterial communities is typically studied by implementing clonal sanger sequencing of 16s rrna pcr products  <cit> . in humans, the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes  was found to be significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean individuals. ley and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that a decrease in the f/b ratio in obese individuals correlated with weight loss over time. the authors suggested that modulation of the abundance of particular bacterial communities inherent to the gut microbiota would be beneficial for the treatment of obesity. in these experiments, the composition of the gut microbiota was monitored over a one-year period using a culture-independent method based on shotgun sequencing of 16s rrna clone libraries. although this method was successfully used for taxonomy characterization at the species level, it was a time-consuming and expensive  <cit>  process that required the application of exceedingly laborious data analyses. the development of an inexpensive and quick clinical diagnostic method would significantly improve our understanding of obesity, which is a common health issue affecting a large numbers of individuals.

in this regard, the new high-throughput technology of pyrosequencing  <cit>  offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional sequencing methods, particularly for metagenomic studies, but also for 16s rrna-based microbial diversity studies  <cit> . a comparison of the cost and high-throughput capacity of sequencing technologies indicated that 454-roche pyrosequencing generated far more sequence data per run at a much lower cost  than conventional dye-terminator sequencing  <cit> . the short length of reads  generated by this new high-throughput technology, however, limits full length bacterial 16s rrna sequence assembly; thus, bacterial taxonomy characterization of mixed microbial samples remains a daunting task with the risk of chimera production. in order to address this problem, recent studies have reported efficient methods for classifying short sequences  <cit>  at the phylum or genus taxonomic level. in addition, short dna-specific regions that exhibit significant variability between bacterial species have been recently investigated to avoid the computational challenge of full-length 16s rrna sequence assembly  <cit> . thus far, however, the sensitivity of the primers used to target short specific or variable regions over the entire bacterial domain is unclear due to the lack of exhaustive 16s rrna sequence testing.

since firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the main bacterial phyla involved in alterations of the gut microbiota in obese individuals, it would be useful to develop a faster and less expensive method for monitoring variations in their relative abundance. in this study, we report a method for rapidly estimating the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes using thousands of pyrosequencing reads generated from near-full 16s rrna gene amplification products or complete bacterial metagenomes. we identified two dna barcodes as genomic signatures specific to the 16s rrna genes of species belonging to the bacteroidetes or firmicutes phylum. such dna barcodes for bacterial phyla are not short sequence tags added to pcr products of microbial samples for massive parallel or barcoding pyrosequencing investigations  <cit> .

one of the major benefits of these dna barcodes was the ability to rapidly provide an accurate f/b ratio from a pool of thousands of short sequencing reads generated by the pyrosequencing method, without the need to assemble sequences, perform multiple sequence alignments, generate phylogenetic reconstructions, or perform blast analyses. therefore, our dna barcodes used in combination with pyrosequencing technology will be useful for clinical diagnosis and for studies involving a large spectrum of subjects and conditions such as exhaustive caloric intake and antibiotic effects.

RESULTS
dna barcodes
the bacteroidetes dna barcode is a specific sequence of  <dig> nucleotides, while the firmicutes barcode is a degenerate sequence composed of  <dig> nucleotides . based on the 16s rrna gene sequence from b. fragilis , the bacteroidetes dna barcode spans base pairs  <dig> to  <dig>  the firmicutes dna barcode spans base pairs  <dig>  to  <dig>  of the 16s rrna gene from c. difficile .

sensitivity and specificity of the dna barcodes
the bacteroidetes dna barcode is also highly specific given that  <dig> % of the  <dig>  16s rrna sequences from the rdp-ii database do not possess this dna barcode . there are actually only  <dig> firmicutes sequences, two planctomycetes sequences, and one cyanobacteria sequence that possess the bacteroidetes dna barcode. using the greengenes database, the bacteroidetes dna barcode was less specific, demonstrating sequence matches with a greater number of phyla . the firmicutes dna barcode was also highly specific, with  <dig> % of all tested 16s rrna sequences from the rdp-ii database lacking this dna barcode. compared to the bacteroidetes dna barcode, the loss in specificity observed with the firmicutes dna barcode is due to the fact that the latter matches  <dig> % and  <dig> % of sequences belonging to the fusobacteria and cyanobacteria phyla, respectively, using the rdp-ii database . however, these two phyla are poorly represented in the intestinal microbial flora   <cit> . finally, using the  <dig>  sequences available in the rdp-ii database, the false-discovery rates for the firmicutes and the bacteroidetes dna barcode were found to be very low,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively.

rdp-ii: ribosomal database project ii. for each bacterial phylum of the rdp-ii and greengenes databases, the percentage of sequences possessing the bacteroidetes and/or the firmicutes dna barcode was calculated.

validation of dna barcodes using full 16s rrna gene sequences
the 16s rrna surveys based on the shotgun sequencing method from 16s rrna clone libraries allow full 16s rrna sequence assembly and can determine the relative abundance of a bacterial phylum using the phylogeny reconstruction arb tool  <cit> . no significant statistical difference  was found when the dna barcode method was used to assess bacteroidetes and firmicutes communities using four published 16s rrna surveys of the gut microbiota .

bacterial relative abundances found in four 16s rrna surveys were compared to those inferred with the dna barcodes application.

the first dataset  was obtained from a study of the diversity of human intestinal microbial flora  <cit>  that demonstrated the firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla represent  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of all 16s rrna sequences. applying our dna barcode method to the same dataset, we observed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of this dataset were represented by the firmicutes and the bacteroidetes phyla, respectively . thus, the percentages obtained for the two bacterial phyla using the dna barcodes or arb tool were very close. a second dataset was obtained from a study of the gut microbiota of obese mice  <cit>  and included  <dig>  16s rrna sequences. in this study, ley et al. reported a 50% reduction in the abundance of bacteroidetes within obese mice compared to a control group of lean mice. for the subset of mice with the obese genotype, our estimate of the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was  <dig> %, while the authors reported a relative abundance of  <dig> %. for the subset of mice in the control group , our method provided a bacteroidetes abundance estimate of  <dig> %, while the authors found a relative abundance of  <dig> % .

in another study, turnbaugh and colleagues analyzed the increased capacity of the microbiome of obese mice to harvest energy from their diet  <cit> . from a dataset consisting of  <dig>  16s rrna sequences, the authors demonstrated that the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in the obese donor and obese recipient groups was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. for these two groups, our results indicated a nearly identical abundance of bacteroidetes . in addition, the relative abundance of bacteroidetes in the lean groups was equivalent using these two methods. the relative abundance of firmicutes for the two obese groups, however, was slightly different using our method  and that reported by turnbaugh et al.  .

the final dataset was retrieved from a survey of 16s rrna sequences found in the gut microbiota of obese humans subjected to a specific calorie-diet  <cit>  and monitored for the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. while the differences between our results and those of this study did not exceed  <dig> % with regard to estimation of bacteroidetes abundance, the relative abundance of firmicutes observed using these two methods differed by up to  <dig> % .

discrepancies
there were only a few 16s rrna sequences that were resistant to equivalent taxonomic classification using the three analytical methods: the arb tool, the dna barcode method, and the rdp-ii classifier. the vast majority of 16s rrna sequences assigned to either the firmicutes or bacteroidetes phyla were similarly classified using the arb tool  or our dna barcode , therefore representing the "core" 16s rrna sequence assignments . in addition to this core, assignment of a small number of 16s rrna sequences to the firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla was performed exclusively by one method or the other , and thus accounting for the discrepancies or ambiguous taxonomic assignments.

with regard to the 16s rrna data presented by eckburg et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> of these sequences were assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group,  <dig> were assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group, and  <dig> were assigned to the  m1\m <dig> group . the most significant discrepancy between m <dig> and m <dig> was observed with the 16s rrna data from turnbaugh et al.  <cit> . in this report,  <dig> sequences were assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group,  <dig> were assigned to the  m1\m <dig> group,  <dig> were assigned to the  m1\m <dig> group, and  <dig> were assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group .

the "rdp-ii classifier"  method was used to obtain additional 16s rrna taxonomic assignments for the sequences defined as discrepancies between m <dig> and m <dig>  we evaluated the agreement between the rpd-ii classifier and the sequence assignments of m <dig> and m <dig> 

the  <dig> sequences in the  m1\m <dig> group , which were assigned to the firmicutes phylum by our dna barcode method, were classified into the fusobacteria phylum  and into a group related to the cyanobacteria phylum  in the eckburg et al. study. similarly, analyses using the rc method resulted in the same classification as eckburg's analysis with a bootstrap confidence  superior to 95%, suggesting that our firmicutes dna barcodes provided  <dig> false-positive results. this result was not surprising given that our firmicutes barcode matched a significant proportion of sequences belonging to the fusobacteria and cyanobacteria phyla in the rdp-ii and greengenes databases . moreover, the  <dig> sequences assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group and the  <dig> sequences assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group were similarly classified using the rc method, confirming the classification reported by eckburg et al. and demonstrating that our dna barcode method failed only in the appropriate taxonomic assignment of a small number of sequences.

based on the16s rrna data obtained by turnbaugh et al., seven sequences among the  <dig> sequences assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group were not assigned by rc to the bacteroidetes phylum as expected, but rather to the firmicutes phylum . interestingly, these seven sequences also possessed the firmicutes dna barcode. in addition, of the  <dig> sequences assigned to the  m1\m <dig> group, six sequences were also classified as bacteroidetes using the rc method . likewise, from the  <dig> sequences assigned to the  m2\m <dig> group, the rc method classified five sequences in the bacteroidetes phylum  and not in the firmicutes phylum. moreover, of the  <dig> sequences assigned to the  m1\m <dig> group, only four were classified as firmicutes  using rc, suggesting the possibility of  <dig> false-positives as a consequence of dna barcode application.

thus, regardless of the method used, these results demonstrate the difficulty inherent to establishing the correct phylum classification for a small number of complete 16s rrna sequences.

dna barcodes applied to short 16s rrna pyrosequencing reads
two pyrosequencing libraries generated in our laboratory for studies related to bacterial diversity in mixed microbial samples were analyzed. the first library was obtained from a brain abscess of a patient at a marseille hospital and contained  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig>  base pairs. in parallel, results using classical sanger sequencing of a 16s rrna clone library from the same sample were used as a source of comparison. we analyzed the f/b ratios using two different culture-independent methods: 16s rrna pyrosequencing and 16s rrna clonal sanger sequencing. the results of the 16s rrna clonal sanger sequencing method indicated that  <dig> of the clone sequences belonged to the bacteroidetes phylum, while  <dig> belonged to the firmicutes phylum, resulting in an f/b ratio of  <dig>  . application of the dna barcode method indicated that  <dig> of the pyrosequencing reads belonged to the bacteroidetes phylum, while  <dig> belonged to the firmicutes phylum, resulting in an f/b ratio of  <dig> . we also analyzed the  <dig>  reads using the sequence classification tool rdp-ii classifier. the f/b ratio obtained using this tool was  <dig>  ; however,  <dig> % of all pyrosequencing reads obtained were too short in length to be classified by the rdp-ii tool. in addition and contrary to our dna barcode classification, the rdp-ii classifier limits the number of sequences that can be submitted . finally, compared to the f/b ratio obtained with the rdp-ii classifier tool , the ratio obtained with our dna barcode method  was closer to that obtained by clonal sanger sequencing .

p, cs and mp mean pyrosequencing, clonal sanger sequencing and metagenome pyrosequencing, respectively. f and b mean firmicutes phylum and bacteroidetes phylum, respectively. the numbers of clone sequences assigned to the firmicutes or bacteroidetes phylum was performed using blast algorithm and genebank database. for the metagenome pyrosequencing, the 16s rrna fraction was found with blast algorithm and rdp-ii database. rdp-ii classifier was used as a control with a bootstrap confidence > 80%

the pyrosequencing error rate in the bacteroidetes barcode sequence, which contains  <dig> homopolymers , was estimated to  <dig> %  for this dataset. in all cases, the sequencing errors in the bacteroidetes barcode sequence were due to a one base insertion  in the homopolymer a. one of these cases also showed a one base insertion  in the homopolymer t .

sequencing errors found in the bacteroidetes barcode 'gggtttaaagg' using the brain abscess pyrosequencing dataset. the sequencing errors were identified as an a  and a t  base insertion.

a second pyrosequencing library from the sputum of a cystic fibrosis  patient from a marseille hospital was also analyzed. this library contained  <dig>  reads with an average length of  <dig>  base pairs. a 16s rrna clonal sanger sequencing approach was also applied to the same cf sputum. the results of the two culture-independent methods were similar, as indicated in table  <dig>  results from the clonal sanger sequencing analysis indicated that  <dig> clone sequences belonged to the firmicutes phylum, while only one sequence was assigned to the bacteroidetes phylum . analysis of the 16s rrna pyrosequencing data indicated that the firmicutes dna barcode matched  <dig> sequence reads, while the bacteroidetes dna barcode matched two sequence reads .

dna barcodes applied to metagenome pyrosequencing
from the metagenomic study performed by turnbaugh et al. <cit> ,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  pyrosequencing reads were collected from lean <dig> and obese <dig> mice, respectively, using the gs  <dig> pyrosequencer. the authors analyzed the merged data  by blasting against the 16s rrna rdp-ii database. using this method, the authors determined the total number of sequence reads classified as 16s rrna genes and the number of sequence reads belonging to bacteroidetes and firmicutes phyla. this analysis led to the determination of an f/b ratio of  <dig> . using our dna barcode method with this dataset assigned  <dig> reads to the firmicutes phylum and  <dig> reads to the bacteroidetes phylum, resulting in an f/b ratio of  <dig>  .

discussion
owing to the rapid accumulation of data coupled with advances in sequencing technology – including the  <dig> life sciences gs flx system sequencer  <cit> , which generates more than  <dig> million bases per run – the development of methods capable of rapidly processing these data has become essential. thus, the aim of the present investigation was to provide a straightforward, accurate, inexpensive and rapid tool to estimate the relative abundance of bacterial communities and the resulting f/b ratios from thousands of 16s rrna short sequencing reads, without the need for any assembly procedure, multiple sequence alignment, blast analysis, or phylogeny reconstruction.

the dna barcode obtained for the bacteroidetes phylum is sensitive and specific. in the literature, dick and field reported a 16s rrna bacteroidetes barcode that can be used as a probe to estimate the occurrence of fecal bacteroidetes  <cit> . as observed with our dna barcode using the rdp-ii database, assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the bacteroidetes dna barcode reported by dick and field produced a sensitivity score of  <dig> %  and a specificity score of a  <dig> % . thus, our bacteroidetes barcode possesses both greater sensitivity and greater specificity. although the fusobacteria and cyanobacteria phyla are responsible for a slight decrease in the specificity of our firmicutes barcode, the relative proportion of both of these phyla is marginal .

compared to the nearly completed 16s rrna sequences assembled from four clone library surveys of gut microbiota, the results obtained using our 16s rrna barcode application are in agreement . importantly, there are some discrepancies that highlight several limitations of the bioinformatics and biological methodologies. first, it is possible that some sequences belonging to the firmicutes or bacteroidetes phyla may not be identified using our method since the sensitivity of our dna barcode is less than 100%. moreover, due to limited specificity , some false-positives may be introduced into the results. another discrepancy is caused by the requirement for polymerase chain reaction and its capacity to generate sequencing errors. a single base sequencing error  located in the region of a conserved nucleotide comprising the dna barcode may result in a false-positive or false-negative result. the quality of the sequencing analysis and the sequence assembly process are important to the quality of the results obtained using the dna barcode method.

the results provided by the rdp-ii "classifier" taxonomic assignment method suggest that there are few errors in the taxonomic classification of the 16s rrna sequences from the clone libraries and emphasize the need to benchmark the tools used in such analyses. to estimate the abundance of phyla within a bacterial community using the phylogenetic reconstruction arb tool, 16s rrna surveys of the intestinal microbial flora first target the computation of a multiple sequence alignment  with the nast multialigner  <cit>  or the autoaligner of the arb software. it is obvious that the quality of the phylogenetic reconstruction is directly related to the accuracy of the sequence alignment analysis. in many cases, an alignment is considered biologically satisfactory when it accurately reflects the structural relationship between the given sequences. as a consequence, msa algorithms are typically benchmarked with a collection of structure-based sequence alignments  <cit> , which are considered to be gold standards  <cit> . in contrast, the processing methods involved in 16s rrna studies suffer from a lack of benchmarking tests or gold standard references  <cit> . thus, the recent msa programs  <cit>  capable of aligning large quantities of 16s rrna sequences must be evaluated for their alignment accuracy, as currently performed for muscle, t-coffee, mafft, probcons, and the clustalw msa programs for protein sequences  <cit> . recently, carroll et al.  <cit>  proposed the first dna database of  <dig>  dna reference alignments. finally, because the accuracy of phylogeny reconstruction depends on the number of informative sites, the short pyrosequencing reads collected by the gs  <dig> are theoretically not suitable for inferring phylogenic reconstruction. in a study performed by zongzhi et al.  <cit> , however, alignment of short pyrosequencing reads by nast and insertion of these sequences into a pre-established phylogenic tree of full-length 16s rrna gene sequences using arb provided satisfactory results. while laborious data analyses involving sequencing of the 16s rrna clone library enable the characterization of bacterial taxonomy at the species level, they do not represent an effective, low-cost strategy for clinical diagnosis or for monitoring f/b ratio variations in a large spectrum of obese humans.

in contrast, 16s rrna or metagenome pyrosequencing offers an inexpensive and rapid strategy that can exploit the use of a dna barcode representative of a bacterial phylum to process thousands of short sequence reads. the short read lengths of pyrosequencing are sufficient to successfully estimate f/b ratios using the dna barcode method, but because our bacteroidetes barcode contains homopolymers and because errors in pyrosequencing reads  occur most often in homopolymeric regions  <cit> , the proportion of bacteroidetes can be underestimated . finally, we assume a similar pyrosequencing error rate in the bacteroidetes and in the firmicutes barcodes since the f/b ratios obtained with the pyrosequencing and the clonal sanger sequencing data were closed .

a short pattern search against a significantly large sequence database  is less time-consuming with respect to cpu time and much faster than performing the blast search algorithm against a 16s rrna database. moreover, results from the blast analysis require that the identified species be grouped by phylum using a tool such as the arb tool.

the evolution of pyrosequencing strategies has focused on targeting of specific regions  <cit>  and maximizing multiplexing capabilities , allowing independent samples to be pooled together and sequenced in a single run due to a short tag carried at the 5'end of the primer  <cit> . since the dna barcodes for firmicutes and bacteroidetes are separated by approximately  <dig> bp, they cannot be sequenced in the same read using pyrosequencing technology. an alternative method using distinct dna amplification  of the 16s rrna region of bacteroidetes and firmicutes barcodes would not be an effective strategy due to differences in amplification efficiency  <cit> . in the near future, however, rapid technical advances  will likely increase the read length and overcome this drawback, which currently prevents massive parallel and specific region pyrosequencing strategies.

finally, these dna barcodes should permit the development of real-time pcr assays using the barcode as a probe. this will be an elegant, low cost, and effective application for day-to-day use in clinical settings.

CONCLUSIONS
based on a dna barcode for 16s rrna gene sequences, we have proposed a useful and practical, yet low cost strategy to effectively evaluate obesity in humans. this is accomplished using a method that rapidly determines the f/b ratio present in a patient. our dna barcodes target the two major phyla of the gastrointestinal bacterial community, which show changes in their abundance in obese humans. additionally, these dna barcodes are capable of rapidly processing thousands of short sequencing reads. the f/b ratios that result from 16s rrna clonal sanger sequencing, 16s rrna pyrosequencing, and metagenome pyrosequencing can be accurately estimated using our dna barcodes.

the short length of the reads that result from high-throughput pyrosequencing coupled with the high degree of nucleotide conservation among the 16s rrna genes prevents sequence assembly. consequently, short dna fragments exploited as dna tags or barcodes that enable the characterization of taxonomy at the phylum, genus, or species level represent tools that are adapted to assist in clinical diagnosis and monitoring relevant changes in the relative abundance of bacterial communities in microbial ecosystems.
