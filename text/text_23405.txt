BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is one of the leading causes of salmonella-related gastroenteritis in humans. the anderson phage typing scheme  <cit> , in which typhimurium is divided into subtypes based on phenotypic variation, resulted from the susceptibility or resistance to a set of bacteriophages, has been used for epidemiological typing for the past 40 years. the success of phage typing has been well documented in the tracking of epidemiological phage types such as dt <dig> in the early 1970s, and recently, the epidemic strain dt <dig> causing outbreaks worldwide  <cit> . typhimurium is a broad host range serovar but has also evolved into host-adapted variants with some phage types being more commonly isolated from particular hosts. for example, dt <dig> is commonly isolated from pigeons and is associated with systemic disease in pigeons  <cit> . host adaptation ensures the circulation within an animal population, and this process may have evolved through the acquisition of virulence determinants and/or loss of gene functions  <cit> .

in australia, three phage types were found to be predominantly isolated from human infections as well as in animals based on surveillance data from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . dt <dig> has been most prevalent, causing 20-27% of typhimurium infections in the past 10 years, and is clearly established in australia as an endemic phage type infecting humans. dt <dig> is less frequent than dt <dig> in human infections but is the most frequent phage type in farm animals, with almost twice the frequency. dt170/ <dig> has been increasing steadily over recent years and became the most frequent phage type in  <dig>  surpassing dt <dig>  <cit> .

we previously addressed the origins and relationships of the common phage types in australia using single nucleotide polymorphisms  as molecular markers  <cit> . snps discovered by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis were used to determine the genetic relationship of  <dig> typhimurium isolates from nine phage types  <cit> . snp typing was later extended in our recent study to incorporate additional snps obtained from comparison of five typhimurium genomes   <cit> . a total of  <dig> snps were able to resolve  <dig> typhimurium isolates with  <dig> phage types into four major clusters . however, the snps used clearly still have limited discriminatory power. there were snp profiles which contained many different phage types. phage types that are prevalent in australia, including dt <dig>  dt <dig> and dt <dig>  were clustered with other phage types. due to snp discovery bias  <cit> , more snps from strains representing the diversity within the snp profiles or phage types will be required to increase the resolution of snp based typing.

genome variations have been observed in studies comparing whole genome sequences of typhimurium strains lt <dig> , sl <dig> , nctc <dig> , and d <dig> , with strain specific pseudogenes and snps found within each genome  <cit> . mobile elements such as prophages, transposons, plasmids and insertions sequences may also vary among typhimurium genomes. the aims of this study were to use comparative genomics to identify the genetic diversity between multiple prevalent phage types and try to begin to elucidate the genetic basis for the predominance of certain phage types and host adaptation.

methods
bacterial strains and genomic dna isolation
six strains were selected to represent the spectrum of typhimurium diversity  based on a previous snp typing study using  <dig> snp markers  <cit> . the selection criteria were based on snp profiles as well as the prevalence of certain phage types from epidemiology data collected from the national enteric pathogen surveillance service   <cit> . a dt <dig> isolate  was selected for comparison against other typhimurium isolates to identify potential genetic factors involved in host adaptation. genomic dna from each strain was extracted using the phenol/chloroform method as described previously  <cit> .

*snp profile that was defined in pang et al.  <cit> .

dna sequencing and assembly
dna libraries were prepared with insert size of 500 bp and were sequenced using the illumina genome analyzer . we used  <dig> × 50 bp paired end sequencing. contigs were assembled using the short oligonucleotide analysis package    <cit> . soapdenovo settings were set with the following parameters: k value =  <dig>  –d =  <dig> and d =  <dig> to generate scaffolds. a k value of  <dig> gave the best n <dig> contig size. large scaffolds and short contigs generated by soapdenovo were aligned to the typhimurium lt <dig> genome  using progressivemauve  <cit> .

accession numbers for the genome sequences obtained in this study were arob00000000-arog <dig> 

identification of snps
mapping of reads against the typhimurium lt <dig> genome was performed using the burrows-wheeler alignment  tool   <cit> . the output generated lists including the number of illumina reads covering each nucleotide position, which corresponds to the reference genome. a custom script was used to extract snps according to the position on the reference genome and the number of reads covering the region containing the snp. some snps could result from errors in mapping or sequencing. therefore, further filtering was performed.

a cutoff of  <dig> reads covering the snp site was used initially to remove snp sites with low coverage. we also used soapdenovo to assemble reads into contigs and then compared with the lt <dig> genome to identify snps. de novo assembly was done using quality trimmed reads. this may have reduced the number of snps. de novo assembly eliminated the problem with reads that may be mapped to spurious positions  with mismatches being called snps. for soapdenovo assembly, reads were trimmed after the first base falling below q <dig>  the read was only excluded if the length of reads was  <dig> bases after the trimming. for bwa mapping, no filtering of reads was performed.

snps identified by both methods were compared. these common snps were manually inspected using samtools   <cit>  and its in-built function, tview, for visualising the mapping of reads at each snp position. snps identified from bwa mapping were further filtered using samtools by snp quality. any snps with quality score of less than  <dig> were removed.

samtools were used to manually confirm all snps for our initial analysis of one genome. we found a consistent pattern where snps were in fact sequencing errors when the region was covered only by ends of reads which is known to have poorer quality. for snp sites with heterogeneous reads , the majority of the snps were genuine if the snp was supported by ≥70% of the reads. a small proportion of snp calls were genuine for those falling between 30% and 70%. none of the snps was genuine if less than 30% of reads supported the snp. in case we removed genuine snps of lower than 20x coverage, we inspected snp sites between > <dig> and < <dig> reads coverage and rescued genuine snps and added to the final set of snps. these genuine snps with lower than 20x coverage generally had 100% support for a snp. non-genuine snps were typically located at the ends of the reads and visual inspection identified them with relatively low subjectivity.

another custom script was used to determine whether snps were synonymous  or non synonymous . the validated snps were also used for comparison to other typhimurium genome sequences d <dig>   <cit> , 14028 s    <cit> , t <dig>    <cit> , nctc <dig>    <cit>  and sl <dig>    <cit> . additionally, an unpublished genome sequence of an unnamed dt <dig> pigeon isolate  was included for comparison. snps were then used to generate a maximum parsimony  tree using the paup package  <cit>  to illustrate the genetic relationships of typhimurium isolates. s. enterica serovar enteritidis strain pt <dig>   and s. enterica serovar choleraesuis strain sc-b <dig>   were used as outgroups.

distribution of insertions and deletions
insertions and deletions  were identified using the mapping data from bwa  <cit> . the distance between the paired ends of a read were first calculated by mapping them to the reference genome. any pairs with distance larger than the average insert size of 500 bp potentially contain a deletion in the newly sequenced genome. there were at least  <dig> fragments  to identify a deletion. the regions containing the potential deletion were examined using the tview function in samtools  <cit>  to locate the approximate breakpoint of the deletion and determine the number of reads covering the region up to the breakpoint with at least 20x coverage for the confirmed deletions. it should be noted this approach cannot identify small indels. we only looked for deletions of at least 500 bp in the new genome. this approach cannot identify large insertions in the new genome either. potential indel events were further compared to other publicly available genomes that were found to be closely related from the snp-based phylogeny to determine whether they were present in the other genomes  <cit> .

identification of new is insertions were done using a similar method. paired end reads with one end mapping to an existing is location in the reference genome while the other end mapping to a distance location. the insertion point was determined visually based on the typical pattern of abrupt end of reads mapping as no overlapping reads can be found at the insertion point. we did not determine the precise location of the insertion using reads that contain part of unique sequence and part of is sequence.

identification and annotation of unique sequences
using progressivemauve  <cit> , some contigs were not able to be aligned. these unaligned sequences were re-aligned using blastn against reference typhimurium genome strain lt <dig> to confirm whether they were duplicated sequences or unique regions. after duplicated sequences were identified and removed, contigs that did not belong to lt <dig> were compared again using blastn against the genbank non-redundant nucleotide collection database to determine their homologues.

phylogenetic analysis
maximum parsimony was done using paup  <cit>  with heuristic search based on tree bisection and reconnection  swap method. s. enterica serovars enteritidis and choleraesuis strains were used as an outgroup. outgroup genomes were aligned using progressivemauve to the lt <dig> reference genome. a custom script was used to extract the nucleotide for each outgroup genome at the corresponding snp containing locations.

RESULTS
selection of strains and genome sequencing
two isolates were selected from snp cluster i from our previous study  <cit> , including l <dig>  and l <dig> . l <dig> is a dt <dig> isolate but in australia, dt <dig> is also known as dt <dig>  this phage type contributes to approximately 15% of typhimurium infections in australia  <cit> . the phage type dt12a was a prevalent phage type in australia but has decreased in recent years  <cit> . however, dt12a was reported with increasing infection during poultry surveillance in the neighbouring new zealand  <cit>  and multidrug resistance as reported by lawson et al. <cit> . l <dig>  was selected to represent snp cluster ii and is one of the most prevalent phage types  <cit> . there were three strains selected for snp cluster iii, l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig> . dt <dig> and dt <dig> are the two most prevalent phage types in australia. l <dig> is a dt135a strain, a variant of dt <dig> which belongs to the same snp profile as other dt <dig> strains. a dt135a strain was selected over dt <dig> since it has been increasing in frequency in recent years in australia. l <dig>  a dt <dig> isolate, was selected as a representative of host adapted phage type. dt <dig> has been commonly isolated from pigeons  <cit> . the genome data of this strain provides a comparison with dt <dig>  a phage type adapted to pigeons which is currently being sequenced by the wellcome trust sanger institute . all except dt <dig> selected in this study are broad host range phage types.

the average number of reads  generated per genome was ~ <dig> , <dig> and the coverage depth on average for all genomes was ~75x, with the lowest coverage of 63x . coverage of the reads against the lt <dig> reference genome ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> reads per site. those with low coverage are most likely reads with multiple sequencing errors aligned in the wrong position. genome coverage based on the lt <dig> reference was approximately 95% on average for the six genomes, with 96% coverage for strains l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig> , 91% for l <dig>  and 98% for l <dig> . the difference in coverage was likely due to genome sequences present in the lt <dig> reference but absent from the strains sequenced. mapping was also performed on the plasmid pslt associated with the lt <dig> reference, which is described in detail below.

single nucleotide polymorphisms in typhimurium strains
we used two approaches to identify snps: mapping to the reference genome and de novo assembly. we first used bwa  <cit>  to map reads against the lt <dig> genome which generated a large set of possible snp sites . for each potential snp, a cutoff of  <dig> reads covering the snp was required in order to exclude snps generated from incorrect mapping or sequencing errors. after filtering the snp sites with low coverage, the average number of snps for the six strains was  <dig>  snps. strain l <dig>  contained the most number of snps with  <dig>  snps identified. we then used soapdenovo to assemble reads into contigs and then compared with the lt <dig> genome to identify snps. four genomes, l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig>  had lower numbers of snps than direct mapping of reads using bwa. snps identified by both methods were further filtered by snp quality and snps with a quality score of less than  <dig> were also removed to derive a final set of snps. there were on average  <dig> snps, ranging from  <dig> snps in l <dig>  to  <dig> snps in l <dig> . the confirmed number of snps was approximately a quarter of the original number of snps identified and this was due to mismatched reads alignments and sequencing errors.

*percentages of the lt <dig> chromosome and lt <dig> plasmid pslt were covered by reads from each sequenced genome.

#in brackets are percentages. nsnp and ssnp are nonsynonymous and synonymous snps, respectively.

the snps were classified into four categories: non-synonymous , synonymous , intergenic  and single base indels. ig snps on average accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the total number of snps in each strain. the average percentage of ssnp for each strain was  <dig> % with l <dig>  having the lowest ratio of ssnps  while the nssnps ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with an average of  <dig> %. single base indels accounted for only 2% of the snps. l <dig>  had the highest number of indels  representing  <dig> % of snps, while l <dig>  had the lowest with eight indels which accounted for  <dig> % of all snps. the ratio between ssnps and nssnps ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

genome tree based on maximum parsimony analysis
the snp data from the six isolates were compared with those from seven publicly available typhimurium genomes: lt <dig>  sl <dig>  d <dig>  14028 s, t <dig> and dt <dig> and an incomplete dt <dig> genome. a maximum parsimony  tree  was constructed using  <dig>  snps with two other serovars, choleraesuis strain sc-b <dig> and enteritidis pt <dig> strain nctc  <dig>  as the outgroup. only one mp tree was generated. the homoplasy index  was  <dig> , indicating the presence of parallel or reverse changes as discussed below. the hi was comparable to what was found previously using snp typing . snps identified from prophages were not used to generate the mp tree as the addition of prophage snps resulted in a hi of  <dig> . external branches contained more snps than internal branches.

in the mp tree, the typhimurium strains were distributed into three clusters designated as genome cluster  i, gc ii and gc iii. strain l <dig>  was found to have diverged the earliest since it was closest to the outgroup and shared most recent common ancestor with the three clusters which were grouped together and supported by  <dig> snps. gc ii and gc iii were grouped together and supported by  <dig> snps. gc i contained three isolates l <dig> , t <dig> and lt <dig> and was supported by  <dig> snps. gc ii contained four publicly available genomes dt <dig>  14028 s, sl <dig>  d <dig>  and three ngs strains; l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig> . gc ii was well separated from gc iii and was supported by  <dig> snps. gc iii contained two isolates, dt <dig> and l <dig>  and was supported by  <dig> snps. the strain specific snps for l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig>  were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. amongst the publicly available genomes, dt <dig> had a large number of strain specific snps  while the strain specific snps for the remaining six genomes  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> 

in this study, the hi was greater than  <dig> which suggests that some snps had conflicting phylogenetic signals. the snps were mapped onto the internal and external branches in the mp tree. there were  <dig> snps present in multiple internal branches, indicating reverse/parallel changes which were likely to be resulted from recombination between lineages. of these,  <dig> were ig snps. for the external branches, the distribution of snps was used as an indicator of recombination within a lineage. it has been previously suggested that recombination event constitutes the presence of three or more substitution events within a 1 kb region  <cit> . there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps, which resulted in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> potential recombinational segments in strains l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig>  respectively. the recombination to mutation rate was similar in l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> with approximately 5% of their snps resulting from recombinational events while l <dig> had the lowest with only  <dig> %. despite the presence of parallel/reverse mutations, the resulting phylogeny was generally consistent with our previous snp typing study. this suggests that the extent of recombination has not yet distorted the evolutionary relationships among the strains and may not play a major role in driving the genetic diversity within this serovar.

insertion sequences
insertion sequences  play an important role in bacterial evolution as transposition can potentially inactivate a gene  <cit> . s. enterica is known to carry three insertion sequences, is <dig>  is <dig> and is <dig> <cit> . is <dig> is rarely detected in typhimurium  <cit>  and was not found among the six ngs strains. is <dig> was previously found in a high proportion of typhimurium isolates included in salmonella reference collection a   <cit> . however, only a single copy of is <dig> sequence was found at the same location in the six strains sequenced. is <dig> was the only is commonly found in the genome strains.

there were  <dig> different is <dig> locations found among the  <dig> typhimurium genomes, with  <dig> located in ig regions  and five in genic regions. the genic insertions are described in the gene disrupting events section below. several of the ig is <dig> locations were found in the same location in multiple genomes. the reference genome lt <dig> contained six copies of is <dig> in ig regions, which were designated as is200_ <dig> – is200_ <dig>  the other is <dig> copies are assigned as is200_ <dig> to is200_ <dig>  fifteen of these is <dig> locations  occurred only in a single strain as shown in figure  <dig>  the average number of copies of ig is <dig> was seven ranging from four to  <dig> copies. is200_ <dig> and is200_ <dig> were likely to have been gained by the most recent common ancestor of gc i, gc ii and gc iii since l <dig>  does not contain either is. additionally, is200_ <dig> was likely to have been lost by l <dig>  and l <dig> . similarly, is200_ <dig> and is200_ <dig> were likely to have been gained by the most recent common ancestor of gc ii as all except one strain contained is200_ <dig> and all contained is200_ <dig> .

gene disruption events
five is insertions were found within a gene. the is <dig> insertion at the acca gene ) and brnq  occurred in a single strain. the insertions at dacb, icda and rnd were shared amongst two or more strains. the disruption of rnd appeared to have occurred early during the divergence of gc ii as all strains belonging to this cluster had the is <dig> insertions. the insertions of is <dig> into dacb and icda occurred three and two times respectively. it appeared to be independent for both cases as the gene disruptions were present in strains from different clusters . we did not determine whether the independent insertions occurred at the exact same site for each gene as potential hotspots for is insertion.

the insertion into icda, found in l <dig> and 14028 s, may have an advantageous effect, with icd mutants known to resist low levels of nalidixic acid  <cit> . the non-functioning icd gene results in the lack of citrate synthase activity, allowing the accumulation of citrate which has an unexplained effect on nalidixic acid resistance.

acca codes for carboxyltransferase subunit and can be inhibited by pseudopeptide pyrrolidinedione antibiotics such as moiramide b. pyrrolidinedione resistant strains of e. coli and staphylococcus aureus have been found to contain mutations in the subunits of acca  <cit> . the is <dig> disruption of acca in l <dig>  may be related to antimicrobial resistance.

another inactivated gene dacb was found in strains l <dig>  and l <dig> . this gene encodes a penicillin-binding protein  <dig>  which functions as a trap target for β-lactams  <cit> . interestingly, the inactivation of nonessential dacb-coded pbp <dig> triggers overproduction of β-lactamase ampc and the specific activation of the crebc  two-component regulator leading to a high level of β-lactam resistance  <cit> .

prophage insertions and deletions
typhimurium strains harbor many prophages  <cit> . the pairwise alignments of the ngs strains against the reference lt <dig> genome were used to determine the presence and absence of prophages. in total, nine prophages or prophage remnants including fels- <dig>  fels- <dig>  gifsy- <dig>  gifsy- <dig>  gifsy- <dig>  st <dig>  cp4- <dig>  st64b and sopeΦ were found in the six ngs genomes .

*prophage remnant.

†na - not applicable.

prophages gifsy- <dig>  gifsy- <dig> and the sope <dig> and ssph <dig> phage remnants were present in all six genomes. they contain virulence genes commonly associated with type iii effector proteins that are injected by the bacterium through type iii secretion  <cit> , and thus are important for virulence.

fels- <dig> and fels- <dig> were only found in strains, l <dig>  and l <dig> , respectively. the sparse presence of these prophages was not surprising as fels- <dig> and fels- <dig> are commonly absent in typhimurium strains  <cit> . fels- <dig> codes for virulence factors nanh and sodciii <cit>  while fels- <dig> harbours the gene abiu of unknown function  <cit> . st <dig> prophage harbours artab which codes for a putative toxin. it is often present in epidemic multiple drug resistant dt <dig> strains  <cit> . interestingly, this prophage was also found in l <dig> .

st64b codes a virulence factor similar to ssek nleb type iii secreted effector proteins  <cit> . this prophage was present in four ngs strains, l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig> , and l <dig> , which were from both gc i and gc ii. st64b was also found in genome strains, sl <dig> and 14028 s, but the prophage is defective in these strains due to a frameshift mutation in the open reading frame  sb <dig>  which leads to the inability to produce infectious virions  <cit> . the same frameshift mutation in sb <dig> was found in l <dig>  and l <dig> . since sl <dig>  14028 s, l <dig>  and l <dig>  all belonged to gc ii, the frameshift mutation may be an ancestral event shared by these gc ii strains.

prophage cp4- <dig> controls phage excision during the biofilm development stage which in turn enhances the motility in the host and increases biofilm dispersal while reducing growth  <cit> . this prophage has been found in e. coli strains suggesting a co-evolution between the two species  <cit> . this prophage was only found in strain l <dig> . since dt135a is a prevalent dt, further studies are warranted to determine the role of cp4- <dig> in adaptation and dt135a prevalence. biofilm formation and dispersal are likely to be important for environmental survival leading to prevalence  <cit> .

the p2-like phage sopeΦ was notably absent in all six strains sequenced in this study. sopeΦ contains the virulence gene sope, and when disrupted reduces invasiveness  <cit> . this prophage was found in epidemic typhimurium strains of dt <dig> and dt <dig>  <cit>  and in two published genome strains sl <dig> and st4/ <dig> 

altogether, the results suggest that prophages may not be maintained in all typhimurium genomes. on the other hand, other studies have shown that prophages can be easily transferred between strains, particularly if the prophages are integrated at a trna site, like the case of st <dig> and st64b  <cit> . thus, prophages make an important contribution to the diversification of typhimurium genomes. the analysis also highlights the important roles prophages may play in virulence and potential adaptation of typhimurium.

large indels
regions of > 500 bp that are present in the reference genome lt <dig> but absent in the ngs strains are identified as large indels. seven large indels were found in the six ngs strains with sizes ranging from 558 bp to  <dig>  bp . indel events were cross-referenced with genomes sl <dig>  d <dig>  dt <dig> and 14028 s to see if they were carried on closely related isolates. five indels were present in only one strain, with two indels shared in more than one strain. deletion of stm <dig>  was found in l <dig>  and l <dig>  and the indel in stm <dig> was found in l <dig>  and sl <dig>  three of the seven deletions encompassed a whole gene while the remaining four deletions were partial deletion of a gene leading to truncations of 15% to 37% of the gene. truncations of more than 20% were treated as pseudogenes  <cit> . thus, all, except stm <dig> which only had a truncation of 15% of the gene, were likely to be nonfunctional. stm <dig> is located in spi- <dig> and codes for a rhs like protein. rhs family proteins have been known to be diverse  <cit> . therefore, the deletion detected in l <dig> and sl <dig> may be a variant of rhs.

interestingly, the genes deleted or truncated appeared to have a role in virulence. gipa is required for survival in peyer’s patches  <cit> . gipa mutants have been shown to be attenuated to some extent after oral infection in mice, but displayed the same level of virulence as the wild type if inoculated intraperitoneally. safa  is part of the saf fimbrial operon. safa mutants are attenuated in a pig model, but not in calves or chickens  <cit> , and the same saf operon is not needed for virulence in mice  <cit> . sopa is used to alter host cell physiology and promote bacterial survival in host tissues  <cit> . sopa mutant has reduced salmonella-induced polymorphonuclear leukocytes transepithelial migration  <cit> .

loss of these genes is expected to be disadvantageous to each corresponding strain, and may explain the differences in the ecology of several phage types. l <dig>  carries gipa deletion, sapa and sopa truncation. however, this phage type has increased in frequency in australia in recent years, which argues against the importance of these genes for virulence in humans, although the increased detection of this phage type may be due to increased ability to colonise food animals, leading to increased exposure in humans. l <dig> , also one of the most frequent phage types, carries gipa deletion and contains a truncated stm <dig>  a transcriptional regulator which regulates the phosphotransferase system and possibly other systems  <cit> .

gene disrupting mutations
apart from gene truncations due to partial deletion of a gene as described above, we identified  <dig> genes terminated earlier when compared to strain lt <dig>  due to a stop codon , leading to proteins that are >20% shorter and thus these genes were considered as pseudogenes. the distribution of these pseudogenes was mapped onto the snp-based mp tree . all, except one pseudogene , was found only in a single strain as a single event. earlier termination in stm <dig> of unknown function resulted in 28% shorter protein and was observed in three strains of the same lineage, l <dig> , l <dig>  and d <dig>  suggesting a common ancestral event.

*based on typhimurium genome strain lt <dig> 

l <dig>  had the most number of strain specific pseudogenes followed by strains l <dig> , l <dig> , dt <dig> and l <dig>  with seven, three, three, two and one pseudogenes, respectively. it is interesting to note that l <dig>  had a higher number of disrupted genes as well as the highest number of snps. this strain also had a 27% shorter dna polymerase ii encoded by polb, which may have resulted in a mutator phenotype.

several pseudogenes for example, napf and blc, if active, are involved in energy conversion and metabolic pathways. napf encodes a predicted 3fe-4s iron sulfur protein  <cit> . napf mutant causes a growth defect under anaerobic conditions on glycerol/nitrate medium but is not essential for the activity of periplasmic nitrate reductase  <cit> . therefore, napf does not have a direct role in nitrate reduction but contributes to energy conservation. in e. coli, blc promoter is expressed during stationary growth phase which is controlled by rpos sigma factor, directing the expression of genes necessary for adaptation to low nutrients condition. therefore, both napf and blc are important for conserving energy.

only one pseudogene, sthb, may be involved in host-restriction. sthb, if active, codes for a fimbrial usher protein. deletion of sthabcde operon results in reduced caecal colonisation in mice  <cit> . furthermore, sthb mutants in chicken hosts have reduced colonisation  <cit> . this pseudogene was only found in l <dig> . since this strain is only commonly associated with pigeons, this gene may have an effect on host restriction.

plasmid sequences
most typhimurium strains including lt <dig> carry a 90-kb virulence plasmid, pslt  <cit> . it contains many known virulence genes including spv , the pef  region, rck , a homolog of dsba  and a homolog of the arac family of transcriptional regulators  <cit> . the published genomes sl <dig>  dt <dig>  d <dig> and 14028 s were all found to contain pslt. in order to determine the presence of pslt from the  <dig> strains sequenced, reads and contigs were mapped onto the lt <dig> pslt sequence . reads homologous to pslt were found in strains l <dig> , l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig>  with 96%, 96%, 86% and 90% coverage to pslt, respectively.

strains l <dig>  and l <dig>  contained reads covering only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the pslt plasmid suggesting that both of these strains did not have pslt. it is likely that l <dig>  has lost the plasmid as all other strains from gc i contained the plasmid. in contrast, it is not known whether l <dig>  has lost the plasmid or the plasmid was only gained after the divergence from the l <dig>  lineage.

l <dig>  contained additional contigs that were not able to be aligned with lt <dig> chromosomal sequence or pslt plasmid sequence. these contigs were then searched against genbank using blastn. eighty eight contigs, ranging from 104 bp to  <dig>  bp, from l <dig>  had the closest match, with 65% dna sequence identity, to the cryptic plasmid phcm <dig> of 106 kb belonging to typhi strain ct <dig>  sequence homologous to repa was identified in one of the contigs suggesting that a novel plasmid was present in l <dig> .

comparison of host adapted phage types: dt <dig> and dt2
phage types of dt <dig> and dt <dig> are commonly associated with pigeons  <cit>  and the mechanism for host-adaptation in these two phage types remains unknown. a previous microarray study on dt <dig> and dt <dig> phage types found that the loss of genetic regions does not correlate with host-adaptation  <cit> . the dt <dig> strain and l <dig>  were well separated within gc ii and adaptation must have occurred independently. comparison of their genomes did not identify any additional sequences that may contribute to host adaptation. there were few indels found common to both dt <dig> and l <dig>  that were not found in other genomes. a region between stm <dig> to stm <dig> was absent, which was previously reported  <cit> . this region encodes several proteins of putative functions including a transcriptional regulator; na+/h+ antiporter; an aminotransferase; glycogen synthesis protein glgx <cit>  and glycosyl hydrolase. it is not clear whether the absence of this region is important for host-adaptation in pigeons since it is also absent in nctc  <dig> , a broad host strain. other genetic elements commonly absent in both dt <dig> and l <dig>  were the fels- <dig> and fels- <dig> prophages. again, both of these prophages were also absent in many of the other typhimurium isolates.

studies have shown that adaptation could be resulted from changes as small as one snp, which can result in either increased or reduced virulence in animal models  <cit> . for example, an rpos mutant lt <dig> strain has reduced virulence in mouse models  <cit> . similarly, a nssnp on fimh has been shown to improve the bacterial adhesion of serovar enteritidis to chicken leukocytes  <cit> . there were no snps in either of these genes in strains l <dig>  and dt <dig>  nssnps in ycjf were found in both l <dig>  and dt <dig>  although the snp locations differed between the two, at codons  <dig> and  <dig> for l <dig>  and codon  <dig> for dt <dig>  ycjf codes for a hypothetical protein and its homolog in e. coli is essential for virulence in vivo in a mouse septicaemia model  <cit> . other than that, there were no snps that were only found in both l <dig>  and dt <dig> 

comparative genome analysis of dt <dig> and dt <dig> revealed few genetic features that are specific to these two host adapted phage types. therefore, multiple factors are likely to have contributed to the adaptation to pigeons.

CONCLUSIONS
six diverse typhimurium strains based on our previous snp typing study were investigated at the genome level and compared to seven other publicly available genomes to determine genetic variations that may contribute to their prevalence and host-adaptations. variations between these genomes largely resulted from accumulation of snps. these genome-wide snps were also used to establish the phylogenetic relationships of  <dig> genome strains. despite the presence of parallel/reverse mutations, the resulting phylogeny was generally consistent with our previous snp typing study  <cit> . other variations included prophages, plasmids and is elements. the pslt virulence plasmid was detected in all except two strains, l <dig>  and l <dig> . interestingly, l <dig>  contained a novel plasmid with some similarities to cryptic plasmid phcm <dig> first reported in typhi ct <dig> 

there was evidence of genome degradation, including pseudogene formation and some large indels. the pseudogenes mainly resulted from earlier termination codons or is <dig> insertions which appeared mostly to be random. however, some is <dig> insertions may provide a selective advantage including insertions in icda, acca and dacb, all of which are related to antibiotic resistance.

comparison of two host-adapted typhimurium phage types, l <dig>  and dt <dig>  did not reveal any unique genetic elements between them. snp-based phylogeny grouped these strains together in gc ii but they were clearly of separate lineages. this suggests that host-adaptation is a result of convergent evolution. however, factors contributing to the prevalence and host-adaptation in typhimurium remain to be uncovered. in conclusion, genetic diversity within typhimurium is mainly due to accumulation of snps, some of which led to pseudogenes. unique genetic elements that were common between host-adapted phage types were not found.
