BACKGROUND
chloroplasts are derived from an endosymbiotic cyanobacterium that invaded the eukaryotic cell a billion years ago. during the evolutionary process from endosymbiont to contemporary organelles, the cyanobacterium lost the bulk of its genome and retained the genes encoding the photosynthesis machinery and the components of several chemical pathways. during this process, it also acquired many host-derived properties and was thus transformed into a distinct organelle: the chloroplast.

angiosperm chloroplast genomes present a similar gene content and gene order. they are circular molecules that can also be present in linear forms with multiple copies, ranging in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb, but usually around  <dig> kb with about 90– <dig> unique genes  <cit> . a pair of large inverted repeats  about 21– <dig> kb in length divides the genome into one large single-copy region  and one small single-copy region . rrna genes are always located in ir regions.

despite the overall conservation of plastomes, genomic diversification was also experienced in many respects. many genes were lost phylogenetically, independently in parallel or uniquely lost in a particular species  <cit> . an extreme example is the cpdna of the parasite plant epifagus virginiana, which lost  <dig> trna genes and retained only  <dig> genes so that the genome was reduced to  <dig> kb  <cit> . it was found that several kinds of inversions interrupted the gene order of the plastome  <cit> . they are generally associated with specific lineages and thus could be a sign of important events in evolutionary diversification  <cit> .

sequence duplication is another feature of some land plant chloroplast genomes. for example, pelargonium × hortorum contains some large duplicated fragments, including several genes, and numerous simple repeats as well as a tremendous extension of ir   <cit> . definite evidence supporting transposition within plastid genomes is lacking, but intramolecular recombination mediated by short direct repeats has been reported  <cit> .

the chloroplast genes have been extensively used to study the phylogenetic relationships at several taxonomic levels, especially in the analysis of basal clades, mainly because they have slower mutation rate in comparison with the nuclear genes  <cit> . the fabaceae  family is one of the largest and more diverse angiosperm families. it comprises about  <dig>  species, which are distributed essentially in tropical regions. chloroplast-derived markers have been used to study the evolutionary relationship between some legume plants   <cit> . however, to date, only the sequences of three legume chloroplast genomes have been reported: lotus japonicus, glycine max,  <cit>  and medicago truncatula . the common bean, phaseolus vulgaris, is a major food crop, domesticated independently in two sites: mesoamerica and south america <cit> . the physical map of its chloroplast genome was published in  <dig>  <cit>  and some small pieces of the chloroplast genome were sequenced to study domestication  <cit>  and phylogeny issues. here we report the chloroplast sequence of p. vulgaris cv. negro jamapa. a comparative analysis of this sequence with other legume chloroplast genomes indicates that these genomes are highly diversified in sequence and organization. moreover, we provide evidence that one plastome  evolved faster than another  at the genomic and gene levels, which could be the consequence of pressure coming from both mutation and natural selection.

RESULTS
general features of the genome
the genome of p. vulgaris chloroplast is a circular molecule of  <dig>  bp that contains an identical ir of  <dig>  bp, separated by an lsc of  <dig>  bp and an ssc of  <dig>  bp . the noncoding regions, including both introns and intergenic regions, comprises  <dig> % of the genome. the overall a+t content for the genome is  <dig> % in contrast to  <dig> % for the noncoding regions. rrna genes and trna genes have the lowest a+t composition with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. a total of  <dig> genes were assigned to the genome,  <dig> of which were unique and  <dig> were duplicated in ir regions. the unique genes included  <dig> coding-protein genes,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrna genes. there were  <dig> genes containing one or two introns, six of which were trna genes.

gene content
the gene content of chloroplast genomes of p. vulgaris, g. max, l. japonicus, and m. truncatula, the legume chloroplast genomes sequenced up to date, was similar. all lacked the rpl <dig> genes and infa, which occurred in other flowering plants. a distinctive characteristic of the p. vulgaris chloroplast genome was the presence of two pseudogenes: rps <dig> and rpl <dig>  rps <dig> is an intron-containing gene present as a functional gene in both l. japonicus and g. max but absent in m. truncatula. in p. vulgaris, rps <dig> has several features that define it as a pseudogene: firstly, it contains four stop-codons within the second exon; secondly, the gene lacks a functional motif located from the positions  <dig> to  <dig> of the amino acid sequence ; finally, its initial amino acid is not atg but ata. the second pseudogene, rpl <dig>  has three stop-codons within its cds and possesses a gtc as the initial codon. to determine if the stop-codons in these pseudogenes were "corrected" during the rna-editing process, we compared their sequence against an est library of p. vulgaris cv negro jamapa  <cit> . a cdna with a perfect match to rpl <dig> sequence was found, indicating that this pseudogene was transcribed and that the stop codons were not edited in its mrna. in contrast, the rps <dig> sequence was not represented in this library. to demonstrate that the presence of these pseudogenes is not a peculiarity of the bean cultivars that we used in this work, the regions containing rps <dig> or rpl <dig> from  <dig> other varieties of p. vulgaris, belonging to two different domestication centers, were amplified by pcr and the products were sequenced. they gave the same sequence, except for 1– <dig> snps , indicating that their presence is a common characteristic of the species. p. vulgaris, g. max, and l. japonicus chloroplast genomes contained  <dig> unique introns. however, m. truncatula lacked intron  <dig> of clpp and the intron present in the 3'-end of rps <dig> 

gene order
each one of four-sequenced legume cpdnas possessed its own genome structure . in comparison with the arabidopsis chloroplast genome , l. japonicus chloroplast genome has almost the same gene order, except for a 51-kb inversion extending from rbcl to rps <dig> in the lsc region, which is present in most taxa of the papilionoideae subfamily of leguminosae  <cit> . in contrast to the plastome of l. japonicus, g. max cpdna seems to have a second inversion embracing the region located between lsc and irs, but is another isomer product of the flip-flop intramolecular recombination present in platomes  <cit> . g. max and m. truncatula shared the same gene order but the conspicuous difference between them was the absence of the irb region in the latter. the p. vulgaris cpdnacontained an inversion at the junction between trnh-gug/rpl <dig> and rps19/rps <dig> which was absent in the three other legume chloroplast genomes. we confirmed the presence of this peculiar structure in  <dig> other p. vulgaris varieties originating from mesoamerican and south american domestication centers, using a concatenated long pcr analysis. this genome inversion has also been reported in the adzuki bean   <cit>  and mung bean   <cit> . these results indicate that the structure found in l. japonicus cpdna was closer to the legume ancestral gene order.

ir region
the ir in p. vulgaris contained  <dig> complete genes and spanned  <dig>  bp, longer than g. max  and l. japonicus . the p. vulgaris duplicated region included the whole rps <dig> gene and  <dig> bp of its downstream sequence, whereas in both g. max and l. japonicus, the irs included only a partial fragment of the rps <dig> gene. thus, the length increase of ir was principally attributed to the expansion of the ir region at the junction between ir/lsc.

the junction points of ir/lsc were located in  <dig> bp from the start base of rps <dig> cds at one end and  <dig> bp from the start base of rps <dig> cds at the other. this was exactly like the adzuki bean <cit> , indicating that this ir predated the speciation of these two bean species, but after the separation from soybean. the boundaries between ssc/ir are located within the ycf <dig> gene and for this reason,  <dig> bp of this gene's 5'-end is repeated. a similar repetition was found in g. max  and l. japonicus , which are shorter than the repeat in arabidopsis .

indel structure
a number of insertions/deletions  present on cpdna homologous regions shared by m. truncatula, g. max, l. japonicus, and p. vulgaris were detected by dna alignments. in figure  <dig>  indels greater than  <dig> bp are shown. indels in p. vulgaris were principally concentrated at the lsc region, only one was in irs ; but deletion was more common than insertion in its cpdna, which resulted in the reduction of the genome size. in contrast, m. truncatula had more and larger indels than other legume plants, and even lost one copy of ir. a large part of the indels was located at the intergenic regions or introns but some of them lay within genes, common in ycf <dig>  ycf <dig>  psaa, rps <dig>  rps <dig>  and accd.

dna repeat analysis
all repeated sequences of  <dig> bp or larger with 100% identity were examined in each of the four legume chloroplast genomes. m. truncatula had the largest number of repeats, as described by saski  <cit> , whereas p. vulgaris had the least. repeats were generally located within the intergenic regions or within introns; however, some of them were present in genes, usually ycf <dig>  ycf <dig>  psaa, and accd.

the biggest direct repeat found in p. vulgaris cpdna was a 287-bp duplication of an internal fragment of ycf <dig> . in p. vulgaris and g. max, this repeat had the same size, while in l. japonicus this segment was a little smaller,  <dig> bp. these two copies in p. vulgaris were identical, as well as in g. max and in l. japonicus, but in m. truncatula, it already diverged, sharing 56% of identity. palindromic repeats were normally situated within intergenic regions and in proximity to the gene end. in p. vulgaris, an identical 20-bp-sized palindromic sequence was found within  <dig> bp from the ends of genes trnh-gug, ycf <dig>  and ycf <dig>  indicating that they could have the same function.

tandem-repeat analysis
the distribution of tandem repeats in the legumes cpdnas is shown in table  <dig>  phaseolus has five groups of tandem repeats, the smallest number of the sequenced legume cpdnas. one repetitive unit of  <dig> bp was duplicated four times within the ir region and was located close to the boundaries of ir/lsc . the alignment of this region with the corresponding sequences of other legume cpdnas available from genbank showed that adzuki bean possessed this duplicated tandem repeat, but with three repeated units each. g. max and l. japonicus lost this sequence. however, m. truncatula had only one 16-bp unit with 75% identity at this position.

m. truncatula had a similar number of reverse and palindrome repeats to other legume plastomes but had a higher proportion of tandem repeats , compared to other legume cpdnas. the majority of tandem repeats were located within coding regions of accd, ycf <dig>  and ycf <dig> genes and into intergenic regions between clpp/rps12-5'end and ycf1/trnn. for example, the accd gene contained seven kinds of repeats in tandem from two to five copies. of all tandem repeats found in m. truncatula, only one  in ycf <dig> was, to a different extent, shared by all the legume plastomes. consensus sequences of repetitive units of each tandem repeat present in m. truncatula cpdna were obtained and searched in the other legume cpdnas. the consensus sequences of repeats within ycf <dig>  ycf <dig>  rps <dig>  and psaa were found in the other genomes but as single sequences .

the largest tandem repeat in m. truncatula, spanning  <dig> bp, was situated at the end of clpp , and it was exclusively found in cpdna of this plant. it consisted of two identical tandem copies of  <dig> bp, repeats a and b . in fact, this segment was also composed of six copies of a smaller repeated unit of approximate  <dig> bp, of which some copies were altered by a few bases  or had some base insertions , but the backbone was conserved. this structure suggests that the  <dig> bp was first duplicated two consecutive times, and then each of these units underwent some degree of diversification to form the  <dig> bp. more recently, this last element was duplicated. similar situations were found in the accd gene and the intergenic region ycf1/trnn.

phylogenetic analysis
legume chloroplast phylogenies were established using a phylogenomic approach and the phylogenetic information of individual genes. in our analyses, we always used the a. thaliana chloroplast genome as the outgroup. from the phylogenomic perspective, we made two large alignments: one with all homologous regions of the five cpdnas but excluding the paralogous regions, and the other, by pasting together the individual alignments of  <dig> individual genes. both gave similar tree topologies, forming two subgroups with a bootstrap value of 100: phaseolus with glycine and medicago with lotus , which correspond to the previously well-established phylogeny  <cit> . it was apparent that, in the group of phaseolus with glycine, phaseolus has accumulated more substitutions than glycine, thus phaseolus diversified much faster , while m. truncatula and l. japonicus has a similar substitution rate . to support the phylogeny obtained with genomes, we also did phylogenies with each of the  <dig> protein-encoding genes . ribosomal rna and transfer rna genes were not included because of fewer base substitutions.  <dig> protein-coding genes produced phylogenies with bootstrap values higher than  <dig>  these  <dig> phylogenies were classified into five topologies: three of them were obtained more frequently  and the other two topologies were only supported by single genes . the most frequent topology, representing  <dig> genes , matched the topology obtained with phylogenomic analysis. topologies d and e represent phylogenies of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively. in all of these topologies g. max and p. vulgaris made a cluster, but m. truncatula or l. japonicus differed in the relation to a. thaliana, the outgroup. it is important to point out that phylogenies obtained with matk and rbcl , two genes commonly used in plant phylogenic analysis, do not fit the genome-based topology, suggesting that care must be taken in interpreting data obtained with these gene-markers.

relative evolutionary rate
the genome-based phylogenies indicate that legume chloroplast genomes change at different rates. to identify which genes and to what extent these genes contribute to the overall evolutionary rate, a relative rate test was performed. the relative rates between phaseolus and glycine and those between medicago and lotus in k, ks, and ka of all protein-coding genes were determined. considering that the outgroup plastome could affect, to some extent, the analysis, each relative test employed one of three different genomes alternatively as an outgroup. the relative rate tests between p. vulgaris and g. max were evaluated using as a reference species, a. thaliana, m. truncatula, or l. japonicus. similarly, the relative rate tests between m. truncatula and l. japonicus were calculated using a. thaliana, p. vulgaris, or g. max as reference group.

in the comparing p. vulgaris and g. max, we found a number of p. vulgaris genes with a strong tendency to evolve faster, despite the different reference species used . all the genes with statistical significance  k, ka, and ks values also produced the same results . we therefore concluded that there was faster diversification of the p. vulgaris plastome than g. max at the genomic level. comparing m. truncatula-l. japonicus, <dig> genes evolved at a significantly different rate ,  <dig> of which accumulated more substitutions in m. truncatula , and two of which had more substitutions in l. japonicus.

# pha. and gly. represent respectively phaseolus and glycine.

* the star signal represents lotus genes with higher substitution rates than medicago genes.

#med. and lot. indicate respectively medicago and lotus.

in both groups, p. vulgaris-g. max and m. truncatula-l. japonicus, all the pet, psa, psb, and atp genes showed no significant difference in substitution rates, and six genes  evolved at different rates . some genes containing significant differences in the group p. vulgaris-g. max did not demonstrate significant differences in m. truncatula-l. japonicus. this result suggests that, in legume plastomes, some genes showed similar evolutionary tendency and others diversified faster in a particular plastome. accd and ycf <dig> presented different rates of both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes, implying that these genes have low functional compromise. moreover, accd and ycf <dig> had a ω index  higher than  <dig>  indicating that they are subjected to a strong diversifying process. the rest of the genes with significant change rates had a w index lower than  <dig>  showing that these genes are under purifying selection.

discussion
gene order and gene content of legume plastomes
in contrast to the genome organization in a. thaliana, most taxa of the subfamily papilionoideae, including the four species of which plastomes are sequenced, present a 51-kb inversion within the lsc region  <cit> . another inversion at the junction points of trnh-gug/rpl <dig> and rps19/rps <dig> was only reported to occur in two genera, phaseolus and vigna <cit> , indicating that this chloroplast genome arrangement is characteristic of the phaseolus-vigna species complex. the chloroplast genome of m. truncatula lacks one ir, a feature shared with other legume tribes such as carmichaelieae, cicereae, galegeae, hedysareae, trifolieae, and vicieae and some genera of other groups  <cit> . now, all these tribes form a new clade, irlc   <cit> . thus, the four-sequenced plastomes represent three types of plastome structure, suggesting that the cpdna organization is very diverse in legume plants.

legume cpdnas do not contain rpl <dig>  <cit>  and infa  <cit>  genes, indicating that they were phylogenetically lost from this lineage. a specific character of p. vulgaris cpdna is the presence of the two pseudogenes rps <dig> and rpl <dig>  the first is functional in l. japonicus and g. max but is lost in m. truncatula  <cit> . the cpdnas of other land plants, selaginella uncinata, psilotum nudum, physcomitrella patens, e. virginiana, and eucalyptus globules, lost this gene independently  <cit> . rpl <dig> is a functional gene basically present in all land plant chloroplasts, except in s. uncinata. these data suggested that p. vulgaris cpdna is still undergoing genome reduction.

the accd gene encodes an acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase subunit similar to prokaryotic accd in structure <cit> , and is the most variable gene present in legume chloroplasts. its size is widely different:  <dig> bp in g. max;  <dig> bp in p. vulgaris;  <dig> bp in l. japonicus, and  <dig> bp in m. truncatula. medicago has the largest accd of prokaryotic form, containing seven kinds of tandem repeats and one 43-bp-sized separate direct repeat situated between two conserved regions. we did a blast-search with the accd gene against the est bank of m. truncatula. one tentative consensus segment of  <dig> bp  was found to contain the identical sequences of chloroplast genes trns-gcu, trnq-uug, psbi, psbk, accd, psai, cema, and peta, indicating that these genes are transcribed. nevertheless, the large amount of tandem repeats present in the m. truncatula accd gene calls into question its functionality.

another landmark of the legume plastomes is the duplication of a portion of ycf <dig>  the duplicated segment, named ψycf <dig>  was first identified as a pseudogene in vigna angularis  <cit> . it is present in the same relative position in the legume plastomes analyzed here. in g. max, p. vulgaris and l. japonicus, ψycf <dig> is identical to its copy within ycf <dig>  but in m. truncatula they are very divergent . this result indicates that the last common ancestor of these plants already had this duplication and gene conversion occurred in the plastomes containing ir.

nature of tandem repeats
the sequence and distribution of repetitive elements are characteristic of each chloroplast genome, and they can be classified in two broad categories: large repeats and short dispersed repeats . both categories can be found in different proportions in chloroplast genomes. oenothera and triticum chloroplasts contain some dispersed repeats, but 20% of the chlamydomonas reinhardtii plastome consists of repeated sequences, many of them are tandem repeats   <cit> . in legume plastomes, clear differences reside in the number, location, and sequence of tr. m. truncatula possess a plastome with greater number and larger trs, and p. vulgaris has a plastome with fewer trs.

usually, trs are classified as a subcategory of sdrs, but our analysis of the legume chloroplast genomes shows that trs have a different origin from the rest of the sdrs. the repetitive unit of an sdr family is dispersed throughout the genome and different members of an sdr family share high identity. in contrast, the repetitive unit of a tr is not dispersed, and the consensus sequence of each tr has low identity with the consensus sequences of other trs, with the exception of some repeats with low complexity . in other words, each tr is specific to a site.

multi-alignments among plastomes frequently show that a repetitive consensus unit of a tr can be found in other chloroplast genomes at similar positions without duplication, or the region containing corresponding sequences are completely deleted from a specific plastome. moreover, some small insertions from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp are the duplication events of one of the flanking sequences in a specific plastome to form a small tr . on the other hand, more complicated trs by consecutive duplication, as shown in figure  <dig>  also exist in other sites of the plastome. taking together our observations, we conclude that trs came from in situ sequences and do not share the same origin of dispersed repeats.

we propose that homology-facilitated illegitimate recombination is the mechanism that creates trs. the reasons are: 1). trs arise from in situ sequences, actually from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp long in the present study; 2) about 4– <dig> bp initial bases of some larger insertions are the iteration of their flanking sequence; 3) there are many copies of the plastome in a cell, both in circle and in linear forms, which provide the opportunity of such recombination; 4) homology-facilitated illegitimate recombination is corroborated by the gene transformation in the chloroplast of acinetobacter sp.  <cit> . recombination mediated by short direct repeats was reported in wheat chloroplast  <cit> .

intracellular sequence exchange
recently, kami reported the sequence from a nuclear bac clone, 71f <dig>  containing a chloroplast-derived dna of p. vulgaris  <cit> . the sequence comparison between the p. vulgaris plastome and the bac clone showed that two separate regions  in the plastome were linked together in the nuclear genome, with the same similarity  to their nuclear homologues. we noted that the nuclear homologues did not contain the insertion in comparison with its plastome sequence, but had  <dig> deletion segments ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. we therefore postulate that the original fragment transferred from the plastome, likely spanned the whole fragment from trni-gau to rps <dig> , and then some deletions occurred, including the deletion of  <dig> kb fragment from trnl to psbz.

a blast-search of the m. truncatula plastome sequences with available nuclear genome sequences of this species found that 51% of the plastome is present in the nuclear genome with more than 99% identity. these identified chloroplast-derived segments of the m. truncatula nuclear genome can be as large as  <dig> kb. one must take into account that we only had the opportunity to explore a partial nuclear genome that is available up to date in genbank, suggesting that the whole plastome could be found in the nuclear genome if the complete nuclear genome becomes available. if so, it is similar to the case of the rice genome  <cit> , but different from a. thaliana, in which the chloroplast-derived fragments found in the nuclear genome have a lesser degree of identity  and the transferred fragments are smaller in size, generally less than  <dig> kb, indicating that cpdna transfer occurs earlier in the a. thaliana genome. in the rice genome, cpdnas are continuously transferred to the nuclear genome, which incessantly eliminates them, until an equilibrium is reached  <cit> . on the other hand, we did not find significant similarity between the plastome of l. japonicus and its nuclear genome. there are several hypotheses to explain the gene transfer from chloroplast to nuclear genomes  <cit> . the most common mechanism of transfer depends on chloroplast lysis, but it is still difficult to elucidate why the nuclear genome of a. thaliana did not integrate cpdna with the same patterns as m. truncatula or o. sativa.

rate of evolutionary change in legume plastomes
there are only a few reports that describe the evolutionary rate of the chloroplast genome  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that one plastome  globally evolved faster than another plastome , which has not been observed before.

in regard to the evolutionary rate of legume plants, lavin reported that phaseolus and closely related genera have the fastest substitution rates at the matk locus, within leguminosae  <cit> . delgado-salinas recently suggested this accelerated substitution rate in matk  is related to the formation of the modern trans-mexico volcanic belt  <cit> . we present further evidence here that the phaseolus plastome genomically diversified rapidly. considering that all the genes in this genome were affected, we deduced that some factor likely impacted this plastome globally, leading to a higher rate of evolutionary change.

evolutionary rate can be mainly affected by the following factors: generation time, population size, specific mutation rate, and natural selection  <cit> . the first three factors should influence all the genes of a genome as a whole, whereas the third is able to impinge on specific genes. generation time is usually considered as an important cause for acting on the evolutionary rate, and has been applied in the elucidation of the discrepancy of evolutionary rates between rodents and other mammals  <cit> , between the plastomes of phalaenopsis aphrodite and grass crops  <cit> , and between rice and maize  <cit> . however, it cannot be applied to explain the phenomenon in the present study because both g. max and p. vulgaris are annual crop plants, sharing the same generation time. population sizes of g. max and p. vulgaris cultivars seem to be similar because they are important domesticated plants with a highly limited genetic diversity  <cit> . the divergent mutation rate could be one of the causes of the variance in the substitution rate between phaseolus and glycine. the reasons are: 1) overall ks in phaseolus is much higher than glycine ; 2) the sites of synonymous substitution are far from saturation in this plastome ; 3) and these two crop plants have the same generation time and similar reproductive mode , which prevents genetic recombination from other plants; and 4) the chloroplast is rarely imported from other compartments of a cell as genetic elements. on the other hand, natural selection should be a factor for the relative rate of specific genes. the present research shows that almost all genes are under a purifying selection . therefore, we conclude that the different evolutionary rate between phaseolus and glycine is a consequence of the pressures of both mutation and natural selection.

the m. truncatula and l. japonicus plastomes evolved at a similar rate . however, the genes with significant differences showed a remarkably distinct rate:  <dig> m. truncatula genes evolved significantly faster than did their l. japonicus counterparts, but two genes, rpoc <dig> and ndhf, changed faster in l. japonicus. in this case, it seems that the particular reason that leads to faster evolution of some genes in one plastome must be natural selection.

CONCLUSIONS
plastomes of leguminous plants have evolved specific genomic structures. they have undergone diversification in gene content, gene order, indel structure, abundance and localization of repetitive sequences, intracellular sequence exchange and evolutionary rates. in particular, the p. vulgaris plastome globally has evolved faster than that of glycine.
