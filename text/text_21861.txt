BACKGROUND
the granulin-epithelin precursor, progranulin   <cit> , also called proepithelin  <cit> , pc-cell-derived growth factor  <cit> , or acrogranin  <cit> , is a secreted glycoprotein that promotes mitosis, survival, and migration in many cell types  <cit> . recent work demonstrates that haploinsufficiency of the pgrn gene causes a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration  that is associated with the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions   <cit> . several studies have shown that ubiquitinated tar-dna binding protein  <dig>  is a component of inclusion bodies in both ftld-u and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   <cit>  although other ubiquitinated proteins are also present in these inclusion bodies in als  <cit> . tdp- <dig> translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in axotomized motor neurons which is consistent with a role for tdp <dig> in the normal response of motor neurons to injury  <cit> . the depletion of pgrn in h <dig> gliomas results in the activation of caspase- <dig> and the accumulation of cleaved tdp- <dig>  <cit> . this is suggestive of a functional relationship between the loss of pgrn and mobilization of tdp- <dig>  although this conclusion has been challenged by other investigators  <cit> . while pgrn is secreted by many cell types it has been suggested that in neurons its subcellular distribution resembles that of mitochondria or lysosomal-endosomal markers  <cit> .

pgrn is synthesised in neurons in many brain regions including the cerebral cortex, in the purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and in the hippocampus  <cit> . in addition, it is widely distributed in the developing central nervous system and the dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia within the peripheral nervous system  <cit> . the roles of pgrn in normal neuronal function and development, in either the central or peripheral nervous systems are poorly understood. it is known, however, that pgrn contributes to normal brain development since it regulates the male-specific differentiation of the neonatal hypothalamus  <cit> . moreover, in culture, pgrn stimulates the proliferation of pc <dig> cells  <cit> , as well as the estrogen-dependent growth of hippocampal neurospheres  <cit>  and may be neurotrophic for cortical and motor neurons  <cit> .

the signalling pathways associated with pgrn in neurons are unknown, but in non-neuronal cell types it activates growth factor-related signal transduction pathways including the phosphorylation of shc, p44/ <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase b/akt, and the p70s <dig> kinase  <cit> , and, by so doing, contributes to carcinogenesis in numerous tumour types  <cit> . pgrn is involved in wound repair and inflammation  <cit> , and plays an important role in early embryonic development  <cit> . the ability of pgrn to regulate critical proliferative, survival and motility signals in a diverse range of non-neuronal cell types suggests that it may support similar functions in nerve cells.

in situ hybridization experiments  revealed that motor neurons express a high level of pgrn, suggesting a significant role for pgrn in the biology of the motor neuron. the significance of pgrn in healthy and diseased motor neurons is, however, unclear. pgrn expression was markedly up-regulated in spinal cord tissue from patients who had als  <cit> . while this was probably due to gliosis  <cit> , increased immunoreactive staining for pgrn has been reported both in motor neurons and glial cells in spinal cord and brainstem tissue sections derived from als patients relative to controls  <cit> . furthermore, pgrn expression is increased in the lumbar cord motor neurons from murine models of familial als that is caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase  <dig>   <cit> . pgrn was one of only  <dig> genes with dysregulated motor neuron expression in sod1g37r and sod1g85r mice at the onset of the disease, as judged by weight loss but before the detection of overt neurological symptoms  <cit> . the pgrn gene was also up-regulated in sodg93a mice, but late in the disease progression  <cit> . in contrast, a decrease in pgrn expression was noted in the nsc- <dig> neuronal cell line engineered to express sodg93a  <cit> . it has been suggested that the pgrn gene may be a modulator of disease progression in als since a correlation between genetic variations in pgrn and the age of onset or survival of patients with als has been reported  <cit> . this observation was not, however, reproduced by other investigators  <cit> . in some patients ftld may be accompanied by motor neuron disease  <cit> , but mutations in pgrn are infrequent in patients with als-ftld defects  <cit> , and for those that have been reported it is uncertain whether or not they are pathogenic  <cit> .

growth factors, in particular vascular endothelial growth factor  <cit>  and insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  <cit> , have shown promise as neuroprotective agents in murine models of familial als and if pgrn is neurotrophic for motor neurons  <cit>  it could also have therapeutic potential in als. given the uncertainty of whether or not pgrn contributes to motor neuron function and survival, we sought first to characterize the expression of pgrn in the healthy brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, and then to investigate its possible biological activities in an immortalized motor neuron cell model.

RESULTS
pgrn is expressed within multiple neuronal cell populations of the mouse brain and spinal cord
the expression pattern of pgrn has been described in the adult brain  <cit> , but not in the remainder of the nervous system. we investigated the expression of pgrn mrna and protein in normal mouse brain and spinal cord. in situ hybridization  was performed on para-saggital sections of brain, trans-sections of cervical spinal cord, and primary cultures of dissociated spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia  . pgrn mrna was detected within numerous neural cell types within the grey matter of the spinal cord . motor neurons in brain  and ventral horn of the cervical cord    <cit> ) robustly expressed pgrn mrna. motor neurons were routinely the first cell population to become visible during chromagen development of the ish signal. the expression of pgrn mrna was investigated in primary cultures of murine spinal cord-drg. pgrn was expressed within motor neurons, as well as other neuronal cells .

expression of pgrn at the protein level was demonstrated by the presence of pgrn-immunoreactive protein within motor neurons in cross-sections of the lumbar spinal cord. figure  <dig> shows co-labelling of large neurons in the ventral cord immunoreactive with both anti-pgrn and the neurofilament marker smi <dig>  which strongly labels motor neurons  <cit> . sm <dig> positive signals were found to predominantly coincide with pgrn immunoreactivity. the expression of pgrn protein was also prominent in motor neurons labelled with smi- <dig> in primary motor neurons from spinal cord-drg cultures  and was also present in cd11b positive microglia in these cultures . pgrn did not co-express with an astrocyte marker  . this was not unexpected since these cells are of different lineages. microglia are derived from hematopoietic stem cells, while astrocytes have oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

subcellular localization of pgrn within primary spinal cord motor neurons and nsc- <dig> immortalized motor neuron cells
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the subcellular distribution of pgrn within primary motor neurons. specificity of the immunoreactivity was validated by antigen competition using murine pgrn . pgrn is primarily found in the cell body with a punctate distribution within the cytoplasm. however, pgrn expression was also prominent within the axons of neurons. pgrn was not observed within the nucleus as defined by tdp <dig> immunofluorescence, nor was it present within mitochondria using cytochrome c immunofluorescence as the mitochondrial marker . interestingly, pgrn immunostaining did not colocalize with calreticulin, a calcium-binding chaperone that facilitates transit of correctly folded proteins and is a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum  . pgrn expression was also apparently absent from the trans-golgi network  as indicated by the marker gm <dig> . this finding was surprising, since the biosynthetic precursor to pgrn carries a signal peptide, the structural cue for passage through the secretory pathway. pgrn did not colocalize with another secreted protein, chromogranin a, ; however, the size of pgrn vesicles appeared to be of a similar dimension to that of the chromogranin a-containing vesicles. pgrn did appear to have limited colocalization with synaptophysin , which is a protein of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis pathway although at the resolution available we cannot exclude the possibility that this is due to a non-specific overlay effect. few lysosomes, if any were positive for pgrn . antibody to pgrn did not colocalize with snap- <dig>  a marker for neurotransmitter vesicle docking and release sites .

subcellular localization of pgrn-enhanced green fluorescent protein in nsc  <dig> cells
further studies confirmed that the subcellular distribution of pgrn in nsc- <dig> cells was comparable to that of the primary motor neurons , including the labelling of nsc- <dig> cells with smi- <dig> which is consistent with motor neuron-like properties. given the disparity between the apparent absence of pgrn immunoreactivity in the er and golgi apparatus  but the presence in pgrn of the structural hallmarks for a protein that should enter the er and golgi apparatus including a signal peptide, glycosylation and disulfide bridging it was essential to re-evaluate the localization of pgrn using an independent technique. lacking an extensive selection of commercial anti-pgrn antibodies validated for use in immuno-staining available at the time, we developed a green fluorescent protein -tagged pgrn construct to investigate pgrn subcellular localization further. this construct, consisting of an enhanced gfp  tag fused to the carboxyl-terminus of the human pgrn gene , was transiently transfected into nsc- <dig> cells .  <dig> hours after transfection, confocal microscopy of the cells demonstrated successful transfection, and a granule-like appearance for the green fluorescent protein signal that was very different from that of control empty egfp vector-transfected cells in which egfp vector expression was more nuclear . the pegfp-n1-hpgrn expressing cells demonstrated clear colocalization of egfp-pgrn within the tgn . furthermore, pgrn distribution was distinct from that of the mitochondria . the presence of the egfp-tagged pgrn in the golgi apparatus is not secondary to pgrn over-expression since when we over-expressed untagged pgrn in nsc <dig> cells, as with the primary motor neurons , no untagged-pgrn immunoreactivity was detected in the golgi apparatus .

over-expression of pgrn in nsc- <dig> cells promotes a neuron-like morphology
the cell line nsc- <dig> was established by fusing embryonic spinal cord cells with neuroblastoma cells and in the differentiated state are reported to exhibit motor neuronal properties  <cit> . they are frequently used to investigate neuroprotective processes and to model motor neuron degeneration in vitro  <cit> . in culture most nsc- <dig> cells exhibit a rounded and undifferentiated morphology; however, serum-deprivation stimulates many of the cells to undergo differentiation and to extend neurite-like projections  <cit> . serum-deprivation is also associated with significant apoptosis of the non-differentiated cells  <cit> . nsc- <dig> cells that express human pgrn were established by transfection and selected for stable incorporation of the human pgrn gene. previous work had demonstrated that human pgrn is mitogenic for murine cells  <cit> . untransfected nsc- <dig> cells, nsc- <dig> transfected with empty pcdna <dig> vector , and nsc- <dig> cells that were transfected with human pgrn cdna subcloned into pcdna <dig>  continued to express equivalent levels of murine pgrn mrna, while only the nsc-34/pgrn cells express the human pgrn mrna . over-expression of pgrn protein was confirmed by western blot analysis . in nsc-34/pgrn cells, pgrn punctate immunoreactivity was found throughout the cell body and within the projections . over-expression of pgrn was associated with morphological changes, such as flattening of cell shape and more pronounced neurite-like extensions .

pgrn over-expression promotes cell survival
to investigate the longevity of nsc-34/pgrn cells,  <dig> independent cultures were propagated for  <dig> months in the absence of serum. within  <dig> days no nsc-34/vector cells survived , however many nsc-34/pgrn cells remained alive, retaining a mixed morphology of undifferentiated cells and cells with complex neurite-like projections . cells with neuron-like morphology remained viable at least for  <dig> months in the absence of serum . at day  <dig>  when compared over short intervals  the neuron-like nsc-34/pgrn cells were changing morphologically, continuing to elaborate and elongate neuritic processes .

between  <dig> and  <dig> days following the removal of serum, cell number significantly decreased in nsc-34/vector cultures, while cultures of nsc-34/pgrn cells showed no such change . the absence of extensive proliferation in nsc34-pgrn cells cultured in serum free medium was further confirmed using a brdu incorporation assay. no significant difference in brdu incorporation between the nsc-34/vector and nsc-34/pgrn cells was observed on days  <dig> and  <dig>  . there was, however, a significant increase in tunel-positive  cells in the nsc-34/vector cultures versus the nsc-34/pgrn cultures . the addition of exogenous recombinant human pgrn to the medium also resulted in an enhanced cell survival that became evident at day  <dig> of the incubation .

the stable expression of an shpgrn construct reduced pgrn mrna levels by approximately 50% . consistent with the qrt-pcr data, significant decreases in the level of pgrn protein was observed in the shrna expressing cells as confirmed by western blot analysis . when the shpgrn cells were cultured in serum-containing medium, cell proliferation was significantly reduced relative to the vector control cells  but there was no statistical change in the proportion of apoptotic cells . the reduced proliferation of shpgrn was reversed by the addition of exogenous human pgrn to the culture medium .

discussion
mutations of the pgrn gene cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration accompanied by the appearance of ubiquitinated-inclusion bodies  <cit> . the formation of ubiquitinated inclusions occurs in other neurodegenerative diseases, in particular in als  <cit> . while mutations of pgrn do not appear to cause als  <cit> , recent work suggests that pgrn is neurotrophic for spinal cord motor neurons  <cit> . here we confirmed that pgrn mrna and protein is expressed in mouse spinal motor neurons, both in situ and in primary culture . other spinal cord neurons, and spinal cord microglia also express pgrn. the expression in microglia , which also has been seen in the brains of alzheimer's patients  <cit> , is of interest, given that microgliosis accompanies motor neuron degeneration. recent evidence demonstrates that in peripheral inflammation, pgrn inhibits the activity of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha  <cit> , and it is possible that pgrn may also regulate inflammatory processes in the spinal cord.

cells of different origins handle pgrn in different ways. whereas epithelial cells appear to secrete pgrn constitutively, innate immune cells including neutrophils process this growth factor to yield  <dig> kda granulin peptides that are stored within granules  <cit> . similarly, pgrn is stored within the acrosomes of guinea pig spermatozoa  <cit> , which are vesicular storage structures. in addition, yeast-two hybrid studies have identified pgrn as a potential partner for nuclear proteins such as cyclin-t  <cit> , adding a further level of complexity to the localization and roles of pgrn.

the subcellular localization and fate of pgrn in neurons has not been previously defined. pgrn appears to be a strong candidate for entry into the er/golgi pathways since the pgrn gene encodes a signal sequence for co-translational entry into the er, it is rich in disulfide bridges and n-glycosylation sites both of which form during transit through the er and golgi compartments. however, it has been suggested that in nerve cells pgrn may localize with either mitochondria or endosomal-lysosomal-like structures  <cit> , which, if correct has profound implications with respect to the mechanism of action of pgrn. it was therefore important to clarify the sub-cellular compartmentalization of pgrn in nerve cells.

punctate pgrn immunofluorescence was observed within the cell bodies and in the axons of primary motor neurons in culture, but not in their nuclei . we were unable to detect any co-localization of pgrn with mitochondria in primary motor neurons in culture . however, we were also unable to detect immunoreactive pgrn in the er or golgi apparatus . the absence of pgrn immunoreactivity in the er/golgi system despite the structural arguments that suggests it would be likely to enter the secretory pathway, may reflect a genuine dissociation of localization. given the structural features of mature pgrn this may also be a misleading result due, for example, to low pgrn concentrations in the er/golgi resulting from rapid transfer through the secretory pathway. alternatively the pgrn antibody may not react with immature protein as it transits through the er/golgi processing pathways. the monoclonal antibody was raised against recombinant mouse pgrn. it is not known whether it would detect an immature form of the protein, namely the conformation of pgrn found in the er/golgi compartment before n-glycosylation and formation of disulfide bridges have been completed. to avoid some of these possible confounding issues we employed an alternate strategy that was independent of immunolocalization to examine the localization of pgrn within neuronal cells. nsc- <dig> motor neuron-like cells were transfected with a pgrn-egfp fusion protein  or with an egfp control alone. the egfp control exhibited green immunofluorescence that concentrated mostly in the nucleus. in contrast pgrn-egfp exhibited a punctuate fluorescence in the cell body and axons, but not the nucleus, in a pattern that was also observed for intrinsic pgrn. the pgrn-egfp fusion protein co-localized with gm <dig>  a marker for the trans-golgi apparatus, but not with a mitochondrial marker . we conclude, therefore that neuronal pgrn enters the er/golgi secretory pathway.

there are three major exit pathways from the golgi apparatus; namely, to the lysosome, to the regulated secretory pathway, which is characterized by dense core secretory granules often containing neuropeptides, or to the constitutive secretory pathway. we detected only limited colocalization of pgrn with lysosomes , suggesting that this is at most only a minor destination for pgrn. the vesicle-like pgrn structures in the motor neurons did not colocalize with chromogranin a , indicating that pgrn does not enter the regulated secretory pathway. there was, however, evidence of some co-localization between pgrn and synaptophysin , although further investigation using higher resolution techniques are necessary to confirm this. pgrn is unlikely to be secreted primarily from synaptic junctions since it did not co-localize with the snap- <dig> marker for neurotransmitter vesicle docking and release sites . the use of the nsc- <dig> pgrn-egfp system in conjunction with confocal microscopy of primary motor neuron cultures may be useful in defining some aspects of pgrn secretion by neurons.

we used the nsc- <dig> cell line to investigate the effects of pgrn upon cell growth and survival. using species-specific reverse-transcription pcr, the expression of human pgrn was confirmed in the nsc-34/pgrn cells, and there was no compensatory alteration in the expression of the murine pgrn mrna . pgrn elicited a change in the appearance of the nsc- <dig> cells, causing a more flattened cell shape and more prominent neuritic extensions . serum deprivation was employed as an apoptotic challenge. upon more prolonged incubation in serum-free medium the number of nsc-34/vector cells declined, becoming statistically significantly different from nsc-34/pgrn between days  <dig> and  <dig> . this was due to reduction in apoptosis in nsc-34/pgrn cells since the number of tunel-positive cells was significantly lower in cultures of nsc-34/pgrn cells compared to cultures of nsc-34/vector cells . the overall cell number did not significantly increase in nsc <dig> cell deprived of serum and, except at the earliest time points, the percentage of brdu positive cells was not significantly changed , suggesting that pgrn is cytoprotective rather than proliferative for nsc- <dig> cells in the absence of serum. the ability of exogenous pgrn to increase the survival of nsc- <dig> cells was confirmed by incubating the wild type nsc- <dig> cells with purified pgrn in serum free medium . in other non-neuronal cells, such as dermal fibroblasts, pgrn is strongly protective against acidosis  <cit> , suggesting that it may play a widespread role in protecting cells against metabolic shocks in their microenvironment.

in order to assess the effect of reduced endogenous pgrn expression upon proliferation, nsc- <dig> cells were stably transfected with shrna for pgrn and validated in terms of rna and protein expression . in the presence of 10% serum, the nsc- <dig> cells actively proliferate. under these conditions the reduction of pgrn mrna expression using shrna silencing decreased cell proliferation by about 50% , but had no significant effect on apoptosis . pgrn added back to the culture medium prevented the inhibition of proliferation brought about by pgrn shrna . this confirms the specificity of pgrn shrna and suggests that pgrn acts primarily through an extracellular mechanism. therefore, pgrn supports both cell survival  and proliferation of ncs- <dig> cells  and these activities can be functionally separated depending on growth conditions.

the enhanced synthesis of pgrn provided prolonged trophic support for nsc- <dig> cells in the absence of serum for periods of at least  <dig> days . the extended serum-free cultures continued to show a mixed population of rounded and more-differentiated cells, however neuron-like cells were maintained throughout. in these cultures the projections became highly elongated, and were dynamic structures that displayed structural rearrangement over a period of a few hours . pgrn may promote neurite extension in cortical neurons  <cit> , and in short-term nsc34-pgrn cultures , however we cannot exclude the possibility that the extended length of projections in the long-term serum-deprived nsc-34/pgrn cultures may be due to improved overall cellular health rather than the direct stimulation of neurite outgrowth.

CONCLUSIONS
primary motor neuron cultures and the nsc- <dig> cell line provide useful models in which to investigate the cell biology, function and mode of action of pgrn in neurons. we have demonstrated that pgrn is highly expressed in normal spinal cord neurons, and that it enters the er/golgi secretory pathway. over-expression of pgrn in nsc- <dig> cells was able to substitute for serum as a trophic support for periods of up to  <dig> months. purified pgrn added to the medium of serum-deprived nsc <dig> cells also decreased the rate of cell death. pgrn knockdown inhibited nsc <dig> cell proliferation in the presence of serum. this work supports the hypothesis that pgrn is neurotrophic and its actions are mediated by extracellular mechanisms.
