BACKGROUND
microarray  transcript profiling and rna sequencing  represent powerful approaches to rapidly gain functional information on a genome-wide scale. information on rna transcript abundance is a key to assessing the biological role of gene products and cannot be directly deduced from a geneâ€™s sequence. this has lead researchers to develop databases of rna abundance profiles, first and foremost for model organisms. for example, the atgenexpress database was created for the model-plant arabidopsis from a host of tissue preferential and stress response expression profiles  <cit> . databases such as atgenexpress are particularly useful for the identification of groups of co-expressed genes. other plant oriented databases include the poplar popgenie made up of tissue, developmental and stress response profiles  <cit> . reflecting the value of gene expression data, public organizations and institutes also maintain generic databases like the gene expression omnibus or geo  and arrayexpress , among others, which host datasets from a wide array of organisms.

recent transcriptome-wide analyses underscore the importance of gene expression in the genetic architecture of complex traits. studies in fruit flies, mice, humans and maize show that a proportion of the genetic variants underlying complex phenotypes exert their effects through gene expression  <cit> ; so, discovering the genetic basis for the variation in transcript abundance is central to understanding phenotypic variation  <cit> . gene expression studies also provide insights into the molecular impacts of natural selection. for example, expression profiling showed the differential action of selection pressure on different tissues and organs in humans  <cit> . a comparative analysis of mouse and human showed a high level of conservation in the expression of orthologous genes, showing the stability of house-keeping genes and the variability of tissue specific genes  <cit> .

transcriptome profiling is facilitated by the availability of a reference genome but many studies have also been based on large-scale cdna sequence datasets. in plants, many angiosperm genomes have been sequenced, including the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , rice  <cit> , poplar  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit> ; however, reference genomes are still lacking for plant phyla belonging to the gymnosperms. the best studied gymnosperms are conifers, which as a group have extremely large genomes . in conifers including pines , spruces , douglas-fir  and japanese cedar  over  <dig> million expressed sequence tags  have been obtained from dideoxy sequencing and assembled to infer putative unigenes or transcript sets . large collections of cdnas are available for white spruce   <cit>  and sitka spruce   <cit> . from 30% to 40% of conifer sequences cannot be annotated because they lack sequence similarity to known genes  <cit> .

this report describes a large-scale oligonucleotide microarray developed from the extensive cdna datasets available for spruce trees  to achieve broad transcriptome coverage. previously, microarrays were developed from pcr amplicons  primarily in pines and spruces . many of the cdna microarrays have ranged from a few hundred to several thousand cdnas, and a few of them have included over  <dig>  spots, i.e. in picea sitchensis  <cit>  and pinus taeda  <cit> . they have essentially been used in comparative experiments  to investigate transcriptome remodeling during tissue differentiation, development, or in response to environmental cues  <cit> , but a general characterization of conifer transcriptomes has been lacking.

a major goal of the present study was to assemble transcript profiles from spruce trees  into a database called piceagenexpress, aiming to characterize the basic features of a conifer transcriptome such as the number of transcribed genes in a variety of tissues. the reference profiles in piceagenexpress enabled exploratory analyses of the diversity of expression patterns within and among gene families and the expression of retrotransposons. in addition, conservation of gene expression in secondary vascular tissue was studied based on interspecific comparisons of tissue preferential expression. the accuracy of microarray profiles and design was directly evaluated by rna-seq analysis of the same samples as those used for one of the microarray experiments included in piceagenexpress.

RESULTS
development of an oligonucleotide microarray for spruces 
a large-scale custom microarray containing  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes was designed for broad representation of the spruce  transcriptome. the  <dig> nucleotide probes were based on unique cdna sequences from white spruce   <cit>  and sitka spruces   <cit>  . both of these conifers have extensive ests and fl-cdna sequence databases developed from dideoxy sequencing ;  <dig> ests  were also available for p. glauca. the probe design parameters and microarray manufacturing methods were experimentally determined through hybridization experiments with a microarray of  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes specifically designed for optimization tests .

 table  <dig> development a large-scale oligonucleotide array for spruces : sequence information used to design oligonucleotide probes from picea glauca and p. sitchensis sequences

1each probe was designed based on the sequence of p. glauca  or p. sitchensis .

the high level of sequence identity in the picea datasets enabled the design of a single probe matching both p. glauca and p. sitchensis sequences, for most genes; however, the datasets did not overlap entirely so that some probes were unique to one of the species and could not be verified in the other. a level of  <dig> % of sequence identity or higher  was obtained for nearly all of the probes relative to p. glauca sequences, and for 59% of the probes relative to p. sitchensis . preliminary experiments indicated that  <dig> mismatches had a small impact on the hybridization signal intensity and the ability to detect differential expression . analyses presented in this report are based on the set of  <dig>  probes designed from p. glauca sequences, which match  <dig>  unique cdnas in the p. glauca gene catalogue of rigault et al.  <cit> .

the potential for utilizing this oligonucleotide microarray in other species and genera of the pinaceae family was evaluated by using comparative rna hybridizations with four different spruces , two pines  and a larch  . the hybridization outcomes were highly similar among the spruces . a large majority of the probe signal intensities varied less than 2-fold among the spruces . when compared to p. glauca, the pines and larch gave more divergent results as shown by the number of common positive probes  and overall data correlations . surprisingly, the pines and larch gave signals of equal or greater intensity than p. glauca for most of the probes, and a decreased signal for 17% to 34% of the detected probes. taken together, these observations indicated that the microarray is suitable for direct comparisons of transcript levels between spruces. for pines and larch, a subset of the probes may not be informative. in general, the ma appears appropriate for studies comparing data within the same genus.

differential expression in the vascular transcriptome is conserved among picea species
microarray transcript profiles compared two tissues that support secondary vascular growth, i.e. diameter stem growth, as it is a key feature of the life habit of trees. secondary xylem is the wood forming tissue located on the internal side of the cambial meristem. it was compared to a composite sample of phloem and phelloderm tissues  located on the outer side of the cambial meristem in three spruce species. identical analyses were carried out in three spruces: p. glauca, p. sitchensis and p. mariana. the number of transcripts detected for these two tissue types were highly conserved in the three species, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in xylem, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in phelloderm. a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed  in all three species. tissue preferential transcript accumulation and the fold difference between the tissues were very similar among the three species . the small number of genes that varied in their tissue specificity  indicated that genes with small difference in expression between tissues were more prone to vary between species or be less accurately determined.

different ma experiments comparing xylem and phloem tissues in angiosperms including arabidopsis  <cit>  and poplar  <cit> , and in p. glauca have helped to delineate groups of genes whose expression was of particular relevance to secondary vascular growth. a ma profiling study in arabidopsis root-hypocotyl defined a set of  <dig> genes specifically regulated in secondary xylem compared to phloem or non-vascular tissues  <cit> . in young spruce trees,  <dig> sequences were shown to be xylem preferential compared to needles and phloem  <cit> . a core set of  <dig> xylem genes was identified by ko et al.  <cit>  based on transcriptome analyses of secondary xylem in arabidopsis thaliana and poplar, and of cotton fibres. the expression patterns reported here for three spruces indicated that tissue preferential expression for xylem compared to phelloderm were conserved among spruces. these conserved patterns could be the basis for comparative genomics of conifers and angiosperms trees. this finding is also relevant for studying the genetic architecture of wood traits because it was shown that xylem preferential expression was a feature of genes associated with genetic variation in wood properties  <cit> .

validation of the microarray and profiling results by rna-sequencing
an rna-seq study p. glauca secondary xylem and phelloderm used the same rna samples as for the ma profiling, but the samples for each tissue type were pooled before sequencing. a total of  <dig>  m high-quality sequences were obtained and mapped to the  <dig>  cdna clusters of the p. glauca gene catalogue as previously described  <cit>  . the sequence frequency data were normalized by transforming the data to reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads  as described by mortazavi et al.  <cit> . these authors estimated that an rkpmâ€‰>â€‰ <dig> represents one rna molecule per cell; therefore, an rpkmâ€‰>â€‰ <dig> was used as a threshold for detection.

 <dig> rpkm, number of reads per kilobase of mapped sequences per megabase based on mortazavi et al.  <cit> .

nearly all of the de genes from the ma analysis  were represented in at least one of the rna-seq samples, and a large majority  of genes with a 2-fold difference on the ma, were also differentially represented in rna-seq . these rna-seq data confirmed the tissue preferential expression  of  <dig> % of the genes determined to be differentially expressed with both methods . the cross-validations between the two methods were based on differential expression in  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes depending on the fold difference threshold; therefore, it represented a highly robust confirmation of the accuracy of the ma results. the overlap in the number of genes varied depending on the fold difference threshold, likely owing to differences in experimental design and technique; however, the preferential expression  was highly congruent between the analysis methods .

the rna-seq detected more transcribed genes than the ma analysis, i.e. close to  <dig>  genes with an rpkmâ€‰>â€‰ <dig> . the number of de genes determined by rna-seq and not by ma ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> , although these results are only suggestive given the experimental design used for the rna-seq. in addition, some of the genes shown to be tissue preferential by ma analysis were suggested by rna-seq to be specifically expressed only in one of the tissue types . interestingly, 50% to 65% of these putative tissue-specific sequences had no annotation based on similarity to tair sequences or the detection of pfam domains, compared to, less than 40% for the entire set of genes represented on the microarray  <cit> . this observation is consistent with findings from animal research showing that genes that have more specific expression patterns also tend to have less conserved sequences among species  <cit> . in evolutionary terms, genes that are expressed only in xylem or in phloem may either represent sequences that are unique or are more highly diverged in conifers compared to other plants.

piceagenexpress contains reference profiles that reveal patterns of tissue preferential expression
the piceagenexpress database was developed from over  <dig> ma hybridizations of picea spp obtained for eight sample types representing different tissues and experiments  . detailed analysis of each of the eight datasets will be presented elsewhere. in any given sample type, transcripts were detected for  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes ; transcripts were detected for  <dig>  different genes considering all of the tissues, i.e. 92% of the p. glauca genes represented on the microarray. the piceagenexpress is made available as a flat file  for ease of upload and access. less than 10% of the genes were unique to one sample type. a simple ranking procedure was applied, as a means to represent the relative expression and enable qualitative comparisons across samples. the genes were ranked within each dataset of piceagenexpress separately, based on average signal intensity in a sample type, and then equally divided into  <dig> intensity categories : from the lowest 10%  to the highest 10%  .

the piceagenexpress database was used as a tool to rapidly assess tissue preferential and invariant expression profiles . it allowed us to identify gene families with diverse patterns of tissue preferential expression. for example, transcripts for three cellulose synthase  genes stood out as being strongly overrepresented in the secondary xylem  compared to all other tissues, where as other cs transcripts were more ubiquitous . this observation was consistent with studies in pine  <cit>  and poplar  <cit>  showing that cesa genes that are specialized in secondary cell wall formation occurred as triplets of genes. a different type of pattern was observed with transcripts for photosystem i and ii proteins, which are generally strongly expressed in green tissues . as might be expected, transcripts of all of the genes in this class were detected at high levels and were co-expressed in young needles, expanding buds, and phelloderm of young trees, and at low levels in non-photosynthetic tissues including roots, immature embryos and megagametophytes. for secondary xylem, the same transcripts were abundant in young trees but low in the mature trees, which could be accounted for by differences in exposure to light and bark thickness. genes encoding house-keeping proteins like ubiquitin did not vary between the tissues . these observations relating to tissue preferential expression are rapid and simple within piceagenexpress. they are also consistent with known expression and physiology, and suggest that the methodology that was followed to develop the database is adequate for revealing key patterns of gene expression.

non-annotated genes are expressed at low levels and in fewer tissues
from 30% to 40% of cdnas from non-model organisms such as conifers could not be annotated by standard sequence similarity searches like blast  <cit>  or hmmer  <cit> . we investigated whether insights into the role of non-annotated sequences could be obtained by surveying their abundance and distribution among tissues in piceagenexpress . first, we observed that non-annotated sequences, i.e. sequences that lacked similarity to known plant genes, were more represented among low abundance transcript classes. on average, the non-annotated sequences represented  <dig> % of the expression class  <dig> genes and  <dig> % in class  <dig> , and a same trend was observed in each of the tissue types . these non-annotated sequences could be either unique to conifers, owing to differential loss or acquisition of genes among taxa, or could be too highly diverged to permit functional annotation. their general low level of expression may suggest that they were expressed in fewer cells or were tightly regulated in some manner, perhaps playing a more specialized role in metabolism or development.

second, our data showed that annotated and non-annotated genes were strongly contrasted in regard to the number of tissues in which transcripts were detected . the majority of the annotated sequences were detected in seven or eight of the tissues. in contrast, the non-annotated genes were much more likely to be found in few tissues. this observation is consistent with the idea that less conserved  sequences may generally play more specialized roles. it is also consistent with findings from comparative expression studies of mice and humans showing that house-keeping genes were more highly expressed and were more conserved among species both in terms of their sequence and their expression  <cit> .

diversity of expression profiles varies within and among gene families with related functions
a total of  <dig> different gene families were reported to be statistically overrepresented in spruce compared to major angiosperms based on the occurrence of protein domains of known function  <cit> . approximately one fifth of them were related to stress responses including osmotic regulation proteins like dehydrin and late embryogenesis abundant protein  gene families. the two families are of similar size in the white spruce gene catalogue, with  <dig> sequences each  <cit> . expression profiles  within these families were examined in piceagenexpress to gain insight into the extent of functional divergence or redundancy that might be associated with gene family expansion. the expression of  <dig> different sequences containing a dehydrin protein domain indicated striking differences between tissue types during normal development. many more dehydrin sequences were detected in roots , megagametophytes and, to some extent, in the phelloderm than in the other tissues . a large group of the sequences seemed to be co-expressed, i.e. all were expressed either very strongly  or more weakly .

expression profiles of the  <dig> gene sequences containing a lea domain also varied between tissues and appeared more diversified than observed for dehydrins . the extent of divergence among the members in each family was analyzed by clustering and determination of euclidean distances among the sequences . overall most of the nodes  were separated by a greater distance in the lea family than in the dehydrin family, indicating that during normal development, the regulation of the dehydrin family members is less diversified. this observation may point at greater functional diversification among leas.

both dehydrins and leas have been shown to be expressed during normal development and to be water stress responsive in conifers  <cit> . our study only considered expression during normal development. previous studies in conifers have monitored the expression of a small subset of these large gene families. for example, five and eight dehydrins transcript sequences were studied in foliage of maritime pine  <cit>  and vegetative buds of norway spruce, respectively  <cit> . we detected  <dig> distinct sequences by ma profiling in young foliage, strongly suggesting that a comprehensive view of this protein family in response to stress remains to be developed. the expression profiles presented here indicated that osmotic-regulation during normal development may involve more genes  and potentially more varied functions in some of the tissues  than others . this observation indicates that osmotic response monitoring, whether it is related to drought conditions  <cit>  or to normal developmental processes  <cit>  may be sensitive to tissue preference. in the piceagenexpress dataset, several dehydrins were down regulated in vegetative buds that were sampled at the time of bud flush in the spring, as was observed through detailed time series analyses of norway spruce dehydrins  <cit> . an interesting feature of the data is that the two seed derived tissues, i.e. immature somatic embryos and megagametophytes from germinating seeds, were highly contrasted in regard to the expression of specific dehydrin and lea sequences.

expression of ltr retrotransposon sequences
recent reports indicated that ltr retrotransposons represented a large fraction of the conifer genome  <cit> . in addition, sequences traced to copia and gypsy-like retroelements were reported as being very frequent in pinus contorta ests  <cit>  and were overrepresented in a root xylem cdna library  <cit> , although some of these sequences may represent genomic contaminations  <cit> . more evidence is needed to show whether any of these elements are active or if activity may vary as a function of development or environmental stresses. the piceagenexpress database was scanned to obtain evidence of rna transcript production, which is the first step for ltr retrotransposon mobilization. a total of  <dig> cdna sequences represented on the ma coded only for protein domains expected for ltr retroelements, such as rnase h, integrase core domain, retrotransposon gag protein and reverse transcriptase. many of the sequences were not detected at all; however,  <dig> sequences were detected in at least one tissue, most of them were found in two tissues or more, and only a few accumulated at high levels  . tissue preferential accumulation was suggested by the fact that few sequences were detected in immature somatic embryos and were present at low levels, where as many sequences were detected and in higher expression classes in mature xylem, roots and megagametophytes.

the ma sequences matching putative ltr were estimated to represent up to  <dig>  unique copies in the p. glauca genome  and a total of  <dig>  million sequences  based on their occurrence in shotgun sample sequencing data for p. glauca  <cit> . data are not currently available to estimate what proportion of the genome these sequences may represent; however, if the sequences were derived from an intact ltr of  <dig> bp on average, they would represent nearly  <dig> gbp or 20% of the p. glauca genome. in other words, such a large number of copies is expected to occupy a sizable fraction of the genome. the number of predicted copies did not appear to correlate with transcript accumulation, i.e. number of tissues in which they were detected or relative levels . this observation indicates that the data were more likely to result from transcription than genomic contaminations of the rna samples. it also shows that the number of copies accumulated in the genome is not useful for predicting the level of transcript production. in fact, many of the high copy sequences  were not detected at all in any of the tissues. these results point to specific ltr sequences that have the highest potential for mobilization in p. glauca.

CONCLUSIONS
an oligonucleotide microarray was developed from p. glauca and p. sitchensis datasets. it represents  <dig>  unique p. glauca genes or 85% of the recently reported gene catalogue  <cit> . single dye analysis and a ranking procedure were used to develop piceagenexpress, a database of reference transcript profiles, based on  <dig> hybridizations in eight different tissue sample types. these data represent the first resource of this kind for a gymnosperm plant.

the pine family comprises over two hundred species belonging to eight genera. it is the largest and the most economically important of the conifers. interspecific comparison experiments presented in this report indicated that the microarray may be applied to at least three of these genera. it could be a valuable tool for species where cdna resources are lacking or underdeveloped. our findings also indicate that expression profiles from p. glauca are likely to be representative of other conifers. rna-sequencing has become a method of choice for transcriptome profiling but the analysis of rna-seq data can be complex owing to factors such as sequence polymorphisms, gene paralogs, and alternate splicing. therefore, successful application of rna-seq depends on the availability or the development of a good quality reference genome or gene catalogue  <cit> , and both are lacking in many non-model species. by mapping p. glauca rna-seq and microarray data back to the same cdnas sequences, we were able to show that the two methods were highly congruent. new sequencing technologies promise to generate high quality sequences in addition to very large volumes of data. given the large size of conifer genomes, it may be advantageous to use these technologies to develop high quality gene catalogues rather than attempt to assemble entire genomes. once a gene catalogue is produced, these high throughput sequences represent a powerful methodology for unrestricted gene expression studies  <cit> .

conifer genomes have a number of characteristics that make them unique, most prominently their enormous size which can reach or even exceed  <dig> gbp  <cit>  and their highly repetitive sequences  <cit> . they are also known to have high levels of heterozygocity and are believed to harbour many gene paralogs, at least in some gene families  <cit> . for the ma described here, the empirical tests of probe specificity  and the probe design parameters appeared sufficient to discriminate between paralogs that are known in the p. glauca catalogue of  <dig>  genes  <cit> . the very high level of congruence observed between ma and rna-seq results,  <dig> % of confirmation of tissue preference from over  <dig> genes, also suggest that the ma results accurately reflect the expression of the target sequences. in contrast, issues of cross-hybridization between gene paralogs with different expression patterns would have likely resulted in a lower validation rate.

the tools and methods presented in this report may lead to diverse applications for fundamental discovery in forest genetics and evolutionary biology, such as understanding phenotypic variation in economic and adaptive traits. the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes in plants and trees is routinely probed by scanning the genome for dna sequence polymorphisms through qtl mapping and association studies  <cit> . however, huang et al.  <cit>  summarized several recent studies by stating that discovering the genetic basis for the variation in transcript abundance was central to understanding phenotypic variation. examining the genetic architecture of gene expression can provide functional insights into physiology and metabolism, for example by revealing the organization of gene networks  <cit> .
