BACKGROUND
the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus  is an important site of neuroendocrine and autonomic control and has distinct subpopulations with different morphological and anatomical characteristics. the magnocellular cells project to the pituitary gland, and the parvocellular cells project to the median eminence, brain stem, and spinal cord  <cit> . within the parvocellular cells, the presympathetic neurons project directly to the intermediolateral column in the spinal cord where the sympathetic preganglionic nuclei are concentrated or project indirectly via the rostral ventrolateral medulla  to influence cardiovascular sympathetic outflows  <cit> . the rvlm contains vasomotor neurons, which regulate tonic and phasic vasomotor tone  <cit> . several previous studies have revealed the important role of pvn-rvlm pathways in the regulation of the cardiovascular system  <cit> .

estrogen, a typical ovarian hormone, influences homeostatic function, reproduction, and the immune system  <cit> . estrogen regulates gene transcription by binding the nuclear estrogen receptor, which contains two subtypes, α  and β   <cit> . the two different subtypes have been shown to be expressed widely in rat brain and distributed differentially across different regions of the brain, of which pvn exclusively expresses er-β  <cit> . the distributional pattern of er-β in the pvn is similar to that of the parvocellular cells projecting to the brain stem or spinal cord  <cit> . this similarity was confirmed by the observation that pvn-rvlm neurons identified by retrograde tracing expressed er-β  <cit> . the aforementioned studies potentially indicate that pvn-rvlm neurons could be major target cells for estrogen within the pvn  <cit> . however, the effects of estrogen on this specific cell population have not been studied.

similar to other neurons, potassium channels control the firing activity of pvn-rvlm neurons  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that the transient outward potassium current  plays an important role in controlling the membrane excitability and firing discharge of pvn-rvlm neurons and that it contributes to remodeling neuronal excitation under pathological conditions  <cit> . ia is encoded by homomultimeric or heteromultimeric complexes of voltage-gated potassium channel  subunits within identical subfamilies  <cit> . among those, kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  have been suggested to be molecular correlates of ia in pvn-rvlm neurons based on their strong immunoreactivities  <cit> . the recent observation that kv <dig>  mrna expression decreased coincident to diminished ia in hypertensive rats  <cit>  supports the correlation of kv <dig>  and ia in pvn-rvlm neurons. our previous study showed that kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  mrnas were abundant in pvn neurons and that the differential expression of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  was parallel to the differences in the delay in the onset of the first action potential  <cit>  that is known to be associated with ia in pvn neurons  <cit> . this suggests that these subunits are closely related to ia in pvn neurons. taken together, kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  are most likely molecular components underlying ia in the pvn, including pvn-rvlm neurons.

several studies have reported estrogenic regulation of kv <dig>  or kv <dig>  transcript levels in tissues from distinct organs, such as the heart  <cit>  and uterus  <cit> , as well as in a hormone-producing brain cell line  <cit> , indicating that kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  are widely expressed target molecules that are modulated by estrogen. furthermore, these studies have shown that alternations in transcript levels of these subunits coincide with changes in ia.

hence, the current study hypothesized that estrogen would modify kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  transcript levels in pvn-rvlm neurons and investigated changes in the mrna levels of these subunits in the pvn-rvlm neurons of ovariectomized female rats  by 17β-estradiol  replacement using single cell real-time rt-pcr. additionally, the study examined alternations in the current density and kinetic properties  of ia using whole cell patch-clamp recording.

methods
animals
sprague-dawley female rats  were used . the rats were maintained under a 12-hr light/dark cycle  and given free access to food and water until sacrifice. anesthesia was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of zoletil  and xylazine  for the surgical procedure. animals were bilaterally ovariectomized . every effort was made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering. the experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of seoul national university and were approved by the institute of laboratory animal resources of seoul national university .

retrograde tracing
one week after ovx, the retrograde-transported fluorescent tracer, fluosphere-red , was injected into the rvlm of ovx-rats to identify pvn-rvlm neurons, as previously described  <cit> . the injection point was, on average,  <dig>  mm caudal,  <dig>  mm lateral, and  <dig>  mm ventral from bregma. to verify that dye was injected into the rvlm, serial medulla slices  of all animals subjected to retrograde tracing were examined after sacrifice.

e <dig> treatment
treatments began on the fourth day after the retrograde tracing process. rats were divided into two groups: the oil-treated group  and the 17β-estradiol-treated group . the treatments were given once daily for four consecutive days prior to sacrifice and brain slice preparation; subcutaneous injections of corn coil  and 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate  were administered to the oil-group and the e2-group, respectively. the quality of treatments was assessed by comparing serum e <dig> concentrations, body weight gain rates, and uterus weights between the two groups. serum e <dig> concentrations were measured using the estradiol elisa kit  according to the manufacture’s manual. blood samples were collected from the abdominal vein of rats before sacrifice, allowed to cluster for 30–40 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 25 min at 4°c. the serum layers were removed carefully into new tubes, and stored in -70°c until used for the elisa assay. body weight was measured before every treatment for all animals. the ratio of increased body weight on each day to the weight on the first day of treatment was used for the body weight gain rate. uteri were isolated after sacrifice, weighed, and normalized to body weights on the day of sacrifice.

hypothalamic slice preparation
hypothalamic brain slices were prepared within 2 hr after the fourth treatment as previously described  <cit>  and used for single cell real-time rt-pcr or electrophysiological recording. after anesthesia, each rat was perfused transcardially with the ice-cold sucrose-rich artificial cerebrospinal fluid  containing   <dig> sucrose,  <dig> nahco <dig>   <dig> kcl,  <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig>  mgcl <dig>  and  <dig> glucose. the brains were briefly removed and dissected to two or three coronal slices , including pvn regions, using a vibrating tissue slicer . the slices were incubated in an oxygenated normal acsf containing   <dig> nacl,  <dig> nahco <dig>   <dig> kcl,  <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig>  mgcl <dig>  and  <dig> glucose for at least 1 hr at 30°c until used.

single-cell real-time rt-pcr
to gain rnas of pvn-rvlm neurons for real-time rt-pcr, the hypothalamic brain slice was transferred to the same recording chamber as that used for electrophysiological recording, perfused continuously with an oxygenated acsf , and maintained at 30–32°c. the fluorescent-labeled pvn-rvlm neurons were visualized by combining differential interference contrast video microscopy with a fluorescence microscope installed with a green filter cube . the cells were approached with patch pipettes, using a micromanipulator , that were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries  and filled with nuclease-free water . after the whole cell configuration was achieved, a slight negative pressure was applied to pull the cytoplasm contents of each cell into the pipette, taking care to avoid including the nucleus. each mixture of cytoplasm and water was immediately removed into a prepared microtube containing   <dig> of nuclease free water  and  <dig> of rnase inhibitor . reverse transcription for single-cell cdna preparations was carried out using high capacity cdna reverse transcription kits  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

pcr amplification was induced with a fraction of the single cell cdna using the steponeplus system  with sybr green detection for kv <dig>  and kv <dig> . sybr green detection was carried out as previously described with a minor modification  <cit> . the primer sequences were as follows: kv <dig>   forward 5′-acaaacgaagggcacagaaga-3′, reverse 5′-catgtaggcatttgcacttcca-3′; kv <dig>   forward 5′-aacgcagggcacagaagaag-3′, reverse 5′-ggcattggagctccctgtt-3′; and β-actin  forward 5′-cattgctgacaggatgcagaa-3′ reverse 5′-agagccaccaatccacacaga-3′. the real-time pcr reactions contained :  <dig> of the cdna template,  <dig>  of 10 μm of each forward and reverse primer,  <dig>  of 50× rox dye,  <dig> of 2× sybr master mix , and nuclease free water. the total volume was 20 μl. the thermal protocol was as follows: pre-denaturation at 95°c for 10 sec, amplification composed of 50 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 5 sec and annealing at 60°c for 25 sec, and the melt curve step following the amplification, to verify the specificity of the pcr products. all samples were run in duplicate. negative controls were assessed by running rt without the reverse transcript. kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  mrna expression was compared between the oil-group and the e2-group using relative quantitative analysis  <cit> . the threshold cycle  value of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  was normalized to that of a reference gene, β-actin, in identical cells. final values were expressed as the n-fold of kv <dig>  or kv <dig>  transcript levels in the e2-group to those in the oil-group. primer efficiencies for each target and reference gene were calculated from the formula e =  <dig> <cit> , where slope was obtained from the relationship between serial cdna dilutions and ct values, resulting in 98% for kv <dig> , 101% for kv <dig> , and 98% for β-actin. the ct values of β-actin were similar across the cells , between the groups, and among plates.

electrophysiological recording
a brain slice was placed in a recording chamber and perfused, and the fluorescent-labeled pvn-rvlm neurons were visualized as described above . patch pipettes were prepared from the same glass capillaries as above, but filled with the internal solution containing  135 k-gluconate,  <dig> kcl,  <dig> hepes,  <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig> egta, and  <dig> mgatp . the open resistance of the pipette ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> mΩ. the axoclamp 2b amplifier  was used for whole cell recordings. the signals were filtered at 1 khz and digitized at 10 khz using an analog-digital converter  and pclamp software . the liquid junction potential  was corrected for further analysis.

ia recordings were obtained in voltage clamp mode. to isolate ia, the modified acsf was used, containing   <dig> nacl,  <dig> nahco <dig>   <dig> kcl,  <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig>  mgcl <dig>  and  <dig> glucose plus  <dig>  cdcl <dig>   <dig> egta,  <dig> tetraethylamonium , and  <dig>  μm tetrodotoxin  to block calcium channels, delayed rectifier potassium channels, and voltage-gated sodium channels. the protocols consisted of depolarizing step pulses, ranging from -70 mv to +25 mv for 400 ms in 5 mv increments, from conditioning pulse to -90 mv or to -40 mv for 340 ms, as described previously  <cit> . currents obtained from two different conditioning pulses were subtracted digitally using pclamp software. to verify that the obtained k+ current was transient a-type, 4-aminopyridine  was applied at the end of the recording. ia amplitudes were used for the subsequent analysis of activation characteristics and current densities. activation curves were plotted with normalized chord conductance, versus step potentials, obtained by dividing the current amplitude by differences between each step potential and reversal potential of k+ ions ; they were then fitted with the boltzmann equation using originpro  <dig> . current densities were calculated by dividing ia amplitudes by cell capacitances. inactivation characteristics of ia were analyzed using the protocol of conditioning step pulses, ranging from -120 mv to -35 mv for 50 ms in 5 mv increments, and successive depolarizing pulses to -10 mv for ia activation, as described previously  <cit> . inactivation curves were plotted with normalized current amplitudes versus conditioning step potentials, and fitted with the boltzmann equation. differences in voltage dependences of ia activation and inactivation between the oil-group and the e2-group were analyzed by comparing the half-activation potential , the slope factor obtained from the activation curve, the half-inactivation potential , and slope factor obtained from the inactivation curve.

to investigate the effects of e <dig> on the membrane excitability of pvn-rvlm neurons, delays to action potential generation were examined in current-clamp mode for both the oil- and e2-groups. the cells were hyperpolarized to near -90 mv, and depolarized by injecting a + <dig> pa current. the delay time was determined by measuring the duration from the point initiating depolarization to the peak of the first action potential. all drugs were obtained from sigma-aldrich except ttx .

statistical analysis
all values were expressed as means ± s.e.m. comparisons between the oil-group and the e2-group were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. when necessary, analyses included two-way anovas with fisher lsd post hoc test. differences were considered significant at p <  <dig> . all statistical analyses were conducted using originpro  <dig>  or spss statistics  <dig> .

RESULTS
the effects of e <dig> treatments on ovx-rats
the mean serum e <dig> concentration measured after sacrifice was 25 ± 4 pg/ml in the oil-group  and 59 ± 11 pg/ml in the e2-group  and was significantly different between the two groups . suppression in body weight gain by the e <dig> treatment appeared significantly on the third day  for the oil-group and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  for the e2-group, *p <  <dig> ); a larger effect was evident on the fourth day  for the oil group and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for the e <dig> group, *p <  <dig> ), as shown in figure 1a. uteri were isolated after sacrifice and normalized to body weights . the mean normalized uterus weight was larger in the e2-group  than in the oil-group , as shown in figure 1b.

retrograde labeling of pvn-rvlm neurons
to identify the pvn-rvlm neurons for recording and single-cell real-time rt-pcr, fluorescent tracer was injected into the rvlm of ovx-rats. after the animals were sacrificed, the serial medulla slices  were examined to determine that the dye was injected into the rvlm. a representative image of the medulla slice, including the rvlm, is illustrated in figure 2a. a dye spot is present within the triangle frame, made by the nucleus ambiguus, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the pyramidal tracts, which was suggested as the guideline for rvlm location  <cit> . figure 2b illustrates the fluorescent-labeled pvn-rvlm neurons in a rat hypothalamic brain slice. the pvn-rvlm neurons were located primarily in the three main pvn subdivisions: the dorsal cap , the ventral parvocellular , and the posterior parvocellular , which was consistent with the previous report  <cit> .

e <dig> effects on the mrna expression density of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  in single pvn-rvlm neurons
to investigate the effect of e <dig> on the mrna expression of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  in rat pvn-rvlm neurons, single-cell real-time rt-pcr was performed. the mrna expression density of the target genes of the pvn-rvlm neurons was compared between the oil-group and the e2-group using the formula 2-Δct , and then analyzed using the 2-ΔΔct method , in which the mrna expression density of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  in the e2-group was expressed as n-fold that of the oil-group. the kv <dig>  decreased  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold in the e2-group  compared to that of the oil-group . however, kv <dig>  showed an unremarkable difference between the e2-group  and the oil-group . the mrna expression density of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  was analyzed according to the subdivisions where the pvn-rvlm neurons were distributed. the pvn-rvlm neurons used in each subdivision are illustrated in figure 3a. as shown in figure 3c, the cells in the dc displayed more prominent reductions in kv <dig>  mrna expression by e <dig>  than those in other subdivisions . in contrast, kv <dig>  mrna expression densities exhibited the smallest differences in the dc . in the pav, kv <dig>  decreased  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold in the e2-group  compared to that of the oil group , while in the papo, it increased  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold in the e2-group  compared to that of the oil group , but the differences were not significant.

e <dig> effects on ia in pvn-rvlm neurons
to examine a change in electrophysiological properties of pvn-rvlm neurons as a result of e <dig>  a whole cell clamp recording was performed with  <dig> pvn-rvlm neurons,  <dig> cells from the oil-group and  <dig> cells from the e2-group. the resting membrane potential , the input resistance , and the membrane capacitance  showed no differences between the two groups .

the study investigated possible ia modulation by e <dig>  to verify that the current recorded in this experiment was ia, 4-ap, the blocker of ia, was applied to the bath solution at the end of recording. when  <dig> cells were tested, 68% of ia peak amplitudes were blocked by 5 mm 4-ap . the ia current densities  significantly decreased in the e2-group compared to those of the oil-group . however, the voltage-dependence of ia activation and inactivation was not different between the two groups  in the oil-group and v1/ <dig> - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, slope factor  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in the e2-group; for inactivation, v1/ <dig> - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, slope factor  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in the oil-group and v1/ <dig> - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, slope factor  <dig>  ±  <dig>   in the e2-group).

when the maximal current densities of ia  were compared between the oil-group and the e2-group, the e2-group expressed significantly smaller current densities than those of the oil-group , *p <  <dig> ). the differential modulation in ia current density by e <dig> was examined according to the different subdivisions, as shown in the mrna expression analysis. a significant reduction in ia current density occurred only in the dc , *p <  <dig> ); other subdivisions did not have similar significant changes  in the e2-group and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf  in the oil-group, figure 4d ; in the papo,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf,  in the e2- group and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pa/pf  in the oil-group, figure 4d ).

e <dig> effects on delay of excitation in pvn-rvlm neurons
the study investigated e <dig> modulation of the membrane excitability of pvn-rvlm neurons by comparing delays in the onset of the first action potential between the oil-group and the e2-group. when hyperpolarized to near -90 mv and depolarized by injecting a + <dig> pa current, most cells generated action potentials. however, delay durations to the onset of the first action potential were different between the oil-group and the e2-group . delays significantly shortened in the e2-group  compared to that of the oil-group . as the extent of hyperpolarization for removing ia inactivation may influence delay durations, hyperpolarizations were compared between the two groups. there were no differences .

discussion
the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the pvn-rvlm neurons, known as presympathetic neurons, have been extensively studied in physiological and pathological conditions  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that er, especially er-β, is substantially expressed in the pvn-rvlm neurons  <cit>  suggesting specific roles of e <dig> in the pvn-rvlm neurons. however, the effects of e <dig> on the cellular properties of pvn-rvlm neurons remain unknown. the present study investigated differences in the cellular properties of pvn-rvlm neurons between estrogen-deficient rats  and estrogen-replaced rats  following e <dig> treatment in vivo after ovariectomy. the investigation focused on kv channel subunit expression and its functional current, ia, because ia is one of the major currents expressed in pvn-rvlm neurons, and kv channel subunits are modulated by altered physiological conditions  <cit> . the results showed that e <dig> significantly down-regulated the mrna expression of kv <dig> , but not that of kv <dig> , and diminished ia current density. interestingly, this effect was only observed in the dc among three subdivisions . e <dig> also shortened the delay in the onset of the first action potential that is known to be associated with ia in pvn neurons  <cit> . these results suggest that e <dig> exerts an inhibitory effect on the function of ia, potentially by selectively down-regulating the transcript levels of kv <dig>  but not kv <dig>  in pvn-rvlm neurons distributed in the specific subdivision. however, some limitations should be considered in the present study. first, the electrophysiological recording and single cell real-time rt-pcr were performed in different cells rather than in the same cells due to the poor quality of the rna samples following a long recording time and continuous exposure of the cells to multiple ion channel blockers. therefore, a direct correlation between ia and kv <dig>  in e2-mediated regulation cannot be confirmed. however, the observation that the down-regulation by e <dig> of the mrna expression of kv <dig>  and the density of ia appeared consistent indicates that kv <dig>  and ia are closely related/associated in the cellular modulation of pvn-rvlm neurons. second, the mechanism underlying e2-mediated regulation of kv <dig>  and ia remains unclear. future studies are warranted to confirm whether er-β located in the pvn-rvlm neurons mediates the transcriptional regulation of kv <dig> . third, the possibility that non-genomic actions of e <dig> contributed to kv <dig>  and ia modulation in the pvn-rvlm neurons cannot be excluded because it has been shown that acute application of e <dig> in bath solution inhibits outward potassium currents, including ia <cit> . e <dig> induces non-genomic events via membrane estrogen receptor or other e2-binding proteins, which activate second messenger cascades, including adenylate cyclase, phospholipase c, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase  <cit> . it was reported that inhibition of the ia density by e <dig> replacement is reversed by application of a kinase inhibitor in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons of ovx-mice  <cit> .

in spite of these limitations, this study is noteworthy because it is the first to reveal estrogenic modulation of cellular properties of pvn-rvlm neurons, particularly its target gene selectivity, for example, for kv <dig>  but not kv <dig> , and its regional selectivity in the dc subdivision. the selectivity for kv <dig>  is interesting because the major potential subunit for ia, to date, in the pvn-rvlm neurons has been considered to be kv <dig>   <cit>  because the latter is predominantly expressed in pvn-rvlm neurons  <cit> . however, our previous study found that kv <dig>  may also contribute to ia in pvn neurons, despite its lower detection frequency compared to kv <dig>   <cit> . the selective modulation of kv <dig>  by e <dig> suggests that even less dominantly expressed subunits could be involved in the cellular modulation or the functions of pvn-rvlm neurons and that gene modulation is not necessarily parallel to preponderance in the gene expression level. the target selectivity of e <dig> in the modulation of kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  is evident in distinct cell types. in heart cells, kv <dig>  was regulated by e <dig>  whereas kv <dig>  was not  <cit> . in uterus cells, kv <dig>  and kv <dig>  were both regulated simultaneously by e <dig> during pregnancy  <cit> . in a gt1- <dig> cell line producing gonadotropin-releasing hormones, kv <dig>  was regulated by e <dig>  <cit> . kv <dig>  was regulated by e <dig> in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus  <cit> . therefore, estrogenic regulation has specific selectivity in molecular targeting, depending on distinct tissues or cells. this selectivity may be related to the differential expression of er subtypes in distinct tissue. in the uterus and the heart, the expression of er-α is greater than that of er-β, which is uncommon in pvn-rvlm neurons.

regional selectivity in e2-induced modulation of kv <dig>  mrna expression suggests that the effect of e <dig> on the pvn-rvlm neurons is likely to be different on each subdivision. e <dig> significantly down-regulated kv <dig>  only in the dc. this finding is consistent with the recording data in which the ia density was significantly down-regulated in the same division by e <dig>  indicating that e <dig> modulation of pvn-rvlm neurons almost reflects the effects of e <dig> in the dc. from this result, we speculate that heterogeneous cells that have different sensitivities and responses to e <dig> exist in pvn-rvlm neurons and that these cells are clustered in a specific region. in this regard, the dc subdivision is likely to be the specific region where e <dig> exerts inhibitory effects on ia functions of pvn-rvlm neurons, potentially by down-regulating kv <dig> . the specific modulation of e <dig> in the dc subdivision may be due to distinct properties of pvn-rvlm neurons distributed in this subdivision. for example, biochemical differences among subdivisions could account for this specific modulation. it has been reported that spinally-projecting pvn neurons which are distributed in similar regions to the pvn-rvlm neurons have different neurochemical characteristics according to subdivisions  <cit> . dynorphin and oxytocin were detected in all subdivisions, but the expression of enkephalin and vasopressin was considerably lower in the dc compared to other subdivisions. immunohistochemical studies showed that er-β was abundantly double-labeled with oxytocin, whereas it was not with vasopressin or corticotropin-releasing hormone in pvn neurons  <cit> . although such neurochemical differences have not been reported in pvn-rvlm neurons, the differences may be closely related to the regional-specific modulation by e <dig> in these neurons.

this study investigated the effects of e <dig> on the membrane excitability of pvn-rvlm neurons by observing changes in the delay of the onset of the first action potential between the oil-group and the e2-group, because ia is known to exert a hyperpolarizing effect on membrane discharge to delay membrane excitation  <cit> . in agreement with e2-mediated down-regulation of ia, the results showed that the delay was shortened in the e2-group. the delay has been referred to as a representative characteristic of magnocellular pvn neurons because these neurons apparently express a stronger ia, coincidentally associated with a longer delay, than parvocellular pvn neurons  <cit> . although the parvocellular pvn-rvlm neurons displayed much smaller delays than the magnocellular neurons, the delays are regulated to a significant extent by e <dig>  and these are probably associated with the regulation of ia. this suggests that reductions in ia and in the delay of the onset of the action potential by e <dig> influence the functions of pvn-rvlm neurons. however, the neuronal properties of pvn-rvlm neurons are determined not only by ia, but also by a variety of other factors. regarding the intrinsic membrane property, other ionic currents besides ia, including voltage-gated calcium channels and small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, participate in determining the excitability of pvn-rvlm neurons  <cit> . studies have reported that e <dig> modulates these channels in other neuronal cells within the brain  <cit> . research has also shown that neuronal activity is governed not only by intrinsic membrane properties, but also by the synaptic inputs of excitatory and inhibitory signals  <cit> . in addition, studies have demonstrated that receptors underlying the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signals are also influenced by e <dig> in other brain regions  <cit> .

the aforementioned raises the question of how e2-induced cellular modulation of pvn-rvlm neurons influences cardiovascular regulation. studies have demonstrated that estrogen plays protective roles in the pathological development of, and the incidence of, cardiovascular disorders  <cit> . accumulating evidence shows that the neuronal activity of pvn-rvlm neurons is elevated by enhancing the intrinsic membrane activity or by eliminating inhibitory synaptic inputs in cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and chronic myocardial infarction  <cit> . therefore, the e2-mediated modulation of pvn-rvlm neurons shown in this study  seems to be controversial with respect to the protective effects of e <dig> on the cardiovascular system because the modified pattern is more likely to reinforce the increase in neuronal excitability induced by abnormal cardiovascular conditions. however, it should be noted that e <dig> exerts different effects, depending on differing cardiovascular conditions. for instance, increased e <dig> levels during pregnancy induce hypertrophy, but e <dig> also attenuates the development of pressure-overload hypertrophy  <cit> . as the present study investigated e2-mediated modulation under normal conditions, different results can be expected under pathological conditions. this expectation is supported by the fact that different molecular targets were employed in the modulation of ia in the pvn-rvlm neurons, depending on the modulating sources involved. a reduction in ia in the pvn-rvlm neurons resulted from e <dig> replacement or artificial hypertension in a similar manner. nevertheless, e <dig> down-regulated kv <dig>  mrna levels, whereas hypertension down-regulated kv <dig>   <cit> . therefore, kv <dig> , as the target of e <dig> actions, could be modulated in different ways in pvn-rvlm neurons, according to normal or pathological conditions. estrogenic effects on pvn-rvlm neurons modified by cardiovascular disorders remain to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that e <dig> modified the cellular properties of pvn-rvlm neurons. e <dig> played an inhibitory role in the ia function in pvn-rvlm neurons and selectively down-regulated the mrna expression of kv <dig>  but not that of kv <dig> . the finding that this modulation occurred predominantly in the dc subdivision suggests that functionally-discrete pvn-rvlm neurons may be distributed in specific subdivisions, indicating that these subdivisions deserve the important consideration in researching pvn-rvlm neurons. this study is the first evidence of estrogenic modulation of pvn-rvlm neurons.
