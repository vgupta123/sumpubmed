BACKGROUND
proper chromosome segregation during cell division requires that sister chromatids produced by dna replication are held together until their controlled separation at anaphase. this function is accomplished by the cohesin complex, whose conserved core subunits consist of the structural maintenance of chromosome  proteins smc <dig> and smc <dig>  the sister chromatid cohesion  protein scc <dig>  and the α-kleisin protein scc1
 <cit> . according to the ring model of cohesin action, smc <dig> and smc <dig> interact to form a v shaped heterodimer, closed by scc <dig> with the help of scc <dig>  to form a ring that is considered to entrap sister chromatids and hold them physically together
 <cit> . cohesion is released at anaphase by the cleavage of scc <dig> by separase, a protease that is activated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome 
 <cit> .

in saccharomyces cerevisiae, cohesion is established by ctf7/eco <dig>  after cohesin has been loaded on chromatin by the scc2-scc <dig> complex
 <cit> . ctf <dig> establishes cohesion during s phase, and interacts with components of the dna replication machinery, including pcna and rfc
 <cit> . these results led to a model in which sister chromatid cohesion is established concomitantly with dna replication
 <cit> . ctf <dig> encodes a zinc finger protein with an active acetyltransferase domain, and it was found that ctf <dig> acetylation of smc <dig> on conserved lysines, was critical for establishment of cohesion by counteracting the wpl1-pds <dig> complex in preventing establishment of cohesion
 <cit> . establishment of cohesion has been suggested to occur in concert with lagging strand synthesis
 <cit> , and smc <dig> acetylation leading to establishment of functional cohesion occurs only in association with replication
 <cit> . recycling of the smc <dig> subunit is aided by deacetylation by hos <dig> following cleavage of scc <dig> by separase to release cohesion at the metaphase to anaphase transition, and is important for establishment of cohesion
 <cit> . the eso1-h <dig> mutant in schizosaccharomyces pombe exhibits delayed mitosis as a result of activation of the spindle checkpoint, and defective segregation of chromosomes in mitosis
 <cit> . in drosophila, mutations in deco result in altered distribution of cohesin at metaphase, and premature entry into anaphase
 <cit> . in humans, mutations in esco <dig> cause roberts syndrome which results from a deficiency of cohesion around the centromeres, and encompasses a number of developmental abnormalities as well as mental retardation and renal and cardiac dysfunction
 <cit> .

the machinery for establishment of cohesion is conserved in arabidopsis, and homologues of scc <dig> and ctf <dig> have been identified and functionally characterized. mutations in atscc <dig> and atctf <dig> result in embryo lethality, however atctf <dig> is dispensable for endosperm growth
 <cit> . interestingly, atctf <dig> was found to possess acetyltransferase activity in vitro, and could complement the yeast ctf7- <dig> mutant, suggesting conserved biochemical function with its yeast counterpart
 <cit> . by using a conditional rna interference  approach, it has been demonstrated that atscc <dig> is required during meiosis for sister chromatid cohesion, chromosomal axis formation and synapsis between homologues
 <cit> . the function of atctf <dig> in establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in planta remains to be shown.

here, we used a conditional rnai approach to examine the role of atctf <dig> in sister chromatid cohesion, and to analyze the effects of the loss of atctf <dig> during vegetative and reproductive development. we found that downregulation of atctf <dig> severely inhibited growth during vegetative and reproductive stages, and resulted in both male and female sterility. during meiosis, atctf7-rnai lines displayed typical loss of cohesion phenotypes, including abnormal chromosome organization, impaired chromosome synapsis and dna fragmentation. consistent with an expected involvement of atctf <dig> in cohesion, we found that sister chromatid cohesion was lost at both chromosome arms and centromeres in atctf7-rnai plants. finally, we found that atscc <dig> localization on chromatin was compromised during meiosis in atctf7-rnai plants, indicating that atctf <dig> is required for association of cohesin with chromosomes in arabidopsis, a feature that appears to be similar to drosophila, where deco is required for scc <dig> association with chromosomes during m phase
 <cit> . overall, our results establish an essential role for atctf <dig> in vegetative development and in sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis.

RESULTS
atctf <dig> is required for growth during vegetative and reproductive stages
to examine the requirement for atctf <dig> during different stages of development we constructed a conditional allele using an inducible rnai approach to deplete atctf <dig> mrna. a hairpin rnai construct for atctf <dig> was made and placed under control of the dexamethasone-inducible transactivator lhgr
 <cit> . t <dig> transformants were grown and seeds collected. t <dig> plants were then grown and treated with dexamethasone either at the vegetative stage or after bolting. treatment during the vegetative stage resulted in defective growth in both aerial and root tissues, accompanied by loss of greening , indicating that atctf <dig> is required for plant growth during vegetative stages. treatment with dexamethasone following bolting resulted in strong inhibition of growth of the inflorescence as well as sterility . pollen was largely sterile and inviable following dexamethasone treatment , and lacked clearly defined sperm and vegetative nuclei . ovules in treated plants showed arrest in female gametogenesis starting at an early stage  as well as missing embryo sacs . a proportion of ovules also showed defects in integument development . a total of  <dig> independent transformants were examined, out of which  <dig> lines showed strong growth defects and sterility following treatment with dexamethasone. quantitative comparison of atctf <dig> expression indicated a reduction in treated compared to untreated control plants , consistent with the growth defects being due to depletion of atctf <dig>  examination of atctf <dig> promoter activity using a patctf7nlsgus reporter indicated that the atctf <dig> promoter is active in both the shoot and root meristematic regions , as well as in young buds and leaves . expression is reduced in older leaves and flowers . within reproductive cells, expression was observed in pollen and in the female gametophyte , and is consistent with the defects in gametogenesis described above for atctf7-rnai plants.
 <cit> . gametophytes were classified as uninucleate , binucleate , missing , or wild type  if they contained greater than  <dig> nuclei. ai: ovules showing abnormal integument development.  dapi staining of mature pollen grains reveals loss of chromatin in the male gametophyte of treated  compared to untreated atctf7-rnai plants, which contains two sperm cells and one vegetative cell.

these results indicate that atctf <dig> is expressed in dividing cells and is required for normal development and growth during both vegetative and reproductive stages.

knockdown of atctf <dig> results in defects in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome organization during meiosis
to examine whether atctf <dig> is required in meiosis, chromosome spreads were carried out on male meiocytes from atctf7-rnai plants . plants that had not been treated with dexamethasone showed normal pairing and synapsis, and normal organization of meiotic chromosomes . early prophase stages were marked by the appearance of thin chromosome threads at leptotene, followed by zygotene and pachytene stages showing normal pairing and synapsis of chromosomes . subsequent late prophase stages and meiosis i and ii stages, were also seen to occur normally in untreated plants . in contrast, plants that were treated with dexamethasone showed severe defects in meiotic chromosome organization . the chromosomal defects were apparent early in prophase i for which the characteristic stages could not be clearly distinguished. chromosomes appeared disorganized and had a patchy appearance with discontinuities. the synizetic knot did not form and mid to late prophase stages were marked by chromosomes appearing clumped and highly fragmented . late prophase stages were characterized by the presence of condensed fragments of chromosomes which could exceed  <dig> in number indicating that fragmentation had taken place .

to examine the role of atctf <dig> in sister chromatid cohesion and pairing at the centromeric region, we carried out fluorescence in situ hybridization  using a centromere repeat probe that hybridizes to all the centromeres
 <cit> . in untreated control plants, 8– <dig> centromere signals  could be clearly detected at early prophase stages  in meiocytes, whereas at zygotene and pachytene stages, 3– <dig> signals  were observed . for dexamethasone treated plants, the number of signals at early prophase ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> . the presence of greater than  <dig> signals at prophase i indicated loss of centromere cohesion in atctf7-rnai plants . in addition there was variability in shape of the signal in atctf7-rnai plants compared to untreated control plants which suggested defects in centromere organization. these results indicate that atctf <dig> is required for pairing, cohesion, and proper organization of centromeric regions. to examine arm cohesion we used a bac probe specific for chromosome  <dig> . in untreated plants, we observed two signals in early prophase, and a single signal in meiocytes at mid-prophase stages when chromosomes had fully synapsed , whereas in plants that were treated with dexamethasone, we observed more than two signals . overall the results indicate that atctf <dig> is required for both centromere and arm cohesion.

reduced association of cohesin with chromatin in atctf7-rnai plants
in order to examine the role of atctf <dig> in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome organization,we examined the localization of the cohesin subunit atscc3
 <cit> , and the axial element protein asy1
 <cit>  during male meiosis . in untreated control plants, atssc <dig> immunostaining extended throughout the chromatin at early prophase stages, and marked chromosomal axes during zygotene and pachytene stages . in contrast, the level of atscc <dig> immunostaining, was greatly reduced in male meiocytes from atctf7-rnai plants from early prophase onwards . asy <dig> immunostaining in control plants is seen at early prophase and marks the chromosome axes at leptotene . the staining pattern overlaps with that of atscc <dig> . in the case of atctf7-rnai plants, association of asy <dig> with chromatin was comparable to that of control plants . thus, although asy <dig> staining of chromatin shows significant overlap with that of atscc <dig>  its association with chromatin appears to be independent of atscc <dig> which is known to precede asy <dig>  and is also consistent with analysis of the atscc3- <dig> mutant
 <cit> .

discussion
ctf7/eco <dig> proteins have been shown to control establishment of cohesion in yeast, drosophila, and mammals
 <cit> . in the case of plants, the arabidopsis homolog of ctf <dig>  has been shown to be required for embryo development but not required for development of the endosperm
 <cit> , leaving open the possibility of a ctf7-independent mechanism for sister chromatid segregation operating in meiosis. evidence for a ctf7-independent mechanism for sister chromatid segregation in yeast is based on the viability of an eco1∆ wpl1∆strain
 <cit> . a dosage dependent role for ctf <dig> in meiosis in yeast has been suggested based on haplo-insufficiency during sporulation
 <cit> . establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis in yeast may therefore be more sensitive to reduced dosage of ctf <dig> than in mitosis. alternatively, acetylation of other proteins by ctf <dig> during meiosis may also be involved
 <cit> . a role for ctf <dig> in meiosis is also suggested from an examination of the localization and regulation of murine esco2
 <cit> , however a requirement for ctf <dig> in sister chromatid cohesion specifically during meiosis remains to be established. in this study we have shown using arabidopsis as a model, that atctf <dig> is also required for sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis.

the conditional rnai approach to examine the function of atctf <dig> in plants revealed defects in sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis. the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in both arm and centromeric regions during meiosis was dependent upon atctf <dig>  the meiotic phenotypes comprised defects early in prophase which presented as discontinuities in the thread-like appearance characteristic of leptotene and zygotene stages. in the most severe cases, the thread-like structure was largely absent and the chromatin appeared highly fragmented. at later prophase stages, the fragmented phenotype was further apparent by the presence of a large number of separated and condensed chromatin fragments. the results are consistent with a failure  to repair double strand breaks for which ctf <dig> is known to be required
 <cit> . the fragmentation phenotype is similar to that observed for atrec <dig> and atmnd <dig> mutants, which are defective in repair of meiotic double strand breaks
 <cit> . however, since the rnai strategy employed is not specific to meiosis, the possibility that the fragmentation phenotype may also be influenced by depletion of atctf <dig> earlier during mitosis in the progenitor cells of the meiocytes is not ruled out. arabidopsis mutants defective in both cohesion and formation of meiotic double strand breaks do not display such fragmentation phenotypes
 <cit> .

we observed severe defects in vegetative as well as reproductive growth and development, pointing to a role for atctf <dig> throughout the plant life cycle, and extending previous work showing an essential requirement for atctf <dig> in embryo development
 <cit> . a patctf7nlsgus reporter was strongly expressed in root and shoot meristems, and in young buds and leaves. in young developing leaves, a polarity in expression was observed with gus staining confined to the basal part of the leaf and absent towards the distal portion. the gradient of expression is similar to that for the cell division marker cycb1;1::gus
 <cit> . expression declined in older buds and was not observed in expanded rosette leaves. the expression of atctf <dig> is thus seen to occur in tissues that are undergoing active cell division, consistent with the known involvement of ctf <dig> in promoting establishment of cohesion in conjunction with dna replication
 <cit> . within reproductive cells, expression was observed in pollen and in the female gametophyte. the sterile phenotype we observed is likely to be accounted for mainly by the defects in meiosis as well as a possible contribution from a gametophytic component.

establishment of cohesion by ctf <dig> involves acetylation of conserved lysine residues in the smc <dig> subunit of cohesion which inhibits the action of the wpl1-pds <dig> complex in preventing establishment of cohesion
 <cit> . in yeast, drosophila, and human cells, ctf7/eco <dig> is required for the establishment of cohesion but not for association of cohesin with chromatin in interphase
 <cit> . in drosophila, a deco mutant shows reduced staining for the cohesin subunit scc <dig> at prometaphase of mitosis
 <cit> . the strong reduction in association of atscc <dig> with chromatin in early meiotic prophase as revealed by immunostaining of meiocytes in atctf7-rnai plants is similar to what has been observed for the deco mutant in prometaphase of mitosis, and suggests conservation of ctf7/eco <dig> function in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our findings show that atctf <dig> is required for establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in arabidopsis, and that continued association of cohesin with chromatin in meiosis depends on atctf <dig>
