BACKGROUND
reorganization of the chromatin structure is one of the main mechanisms for regulation of gene expression in plants, chromatin rearrangements take place in response to light and tissue-specific signalling molecules  <cit> . despite rapid progress in the field, the functional significance of some groups of nuclear proteins, including the tightly bound to dna proteins , remains obscure. tbp is a specific nuclear protein group that remains attached to dna with covalent or non-covalent bonds after its deproteinisation independently of the deproteinisation method applied: protease digestion, phenol extraction, chloroform extraction or salting-out. the tbp have been found in the dna of numerous evolutionary distant species  <cit> . both the function of the tbps and the nature of dna sequences involved in the tight complexes remain to be detailed. enrichment of the tbps in specific dna sequences is of special interest in connection with speculation on the potential function of such sequences in higher order structures of the genome of different organisms including humans, mouse, and chicken  <cit> . in our recent work  <cit>  we have applied the dna microarray technique to study the distribution of tbps along the chicken alpha-globin domain in cell lines that expressed the gene, did not express it or conducted abortive expression. in this study we have shown profound transcription-dependent changes in the tbp-distribution pattern in the alpha-globin domain. other preliminary results from of our team  <cit>  also indicated the existence of tissue- and development specificity in the patterns of tbp distribution in barley  shoots.

the life cycle of the barley plant, especially the shoot and seed provide an excellent model for plant development studies. barley shoot and seed developmental stages are well characterized and classified  <cit> . etiolated barley seedlings provide cell populations with different proliferation, differentiation and senescence status including synchronously dividing cell populations of primary leaf  <cit> , senescent coleoptiles and a mixed cell population from roots  <cit> . in the present work we used dry grains  and grains after  <dig> h of imbibition ; coleoptiles, first leaves and roots were dissected from shoots of zadoks  <dig>  and zadoks  <dig>  development stages as well as seeds of watery ripe  and medium milk development .

moreover, expression of several specific enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism in barley is development- or/and tissue specific and is restricted to well-defined stages of the plant development  <cit> . it was reported that transcription of α-amylase genes is low and decreases during seed development, but β-amylase expression in endosperm is up-regulated during its development  <cit> . two representatives of each group of amylase genes, the amy32b and bmy <dig> genes provide prospective model systems. highly conserved in barley cultivars, amy32b gene  <cit>  is located on chromosome 7h in the centromere region  <cit> . gene encodes a low-pi α-amylase and is expressed in barley aleurone cells under the control of gibberellic acid and abscisic acid  <cit> . highly polymorphic in structure, barley bmy <dig> gene  <cit>  is located in the long arm of chromosome 4h  <cit> , encodes endosperm specific β-amylase and is expressed only during seed development  <cit> . several allelic forms of bmy <dig> structural gene were sequenced and analyzed in relation to their functionality  <cit> .

despite the fact that barley genome is not completely sequenced, work with this plant provides the opportunity to use the technique of mapped barley genomic markers developed during recent decades  <cit> . the tool allows chromosome profiling to be performed in any application.

in order to study transcription, tissue and development dependent changes in tbps distribution in barley genes and chromosomes at different phases of shoot and seed development, we have formulated the following as the goals of the present study:  <dig>  to investigate the distribution of tbps along amy32b and bmy <dig> genes using oligonucleotide dna arrays;  <dig>  to characterize the polypeptide spectrum of tbp in different shoot organs and during different development stages.  <dig>  to apply mapped barley ms as a tool to study tissue and developmental specificity in the distribution of dna complexes with tbp  in the barley chromosomes 1h and 7h;  <dig>  to compare the chromosomal distribution of tbp-dna complexes and distribution of tight dna-protein complexes separated using other than tbp isolation approaches including nuclear matrix isolation and nucleoprotein chromatography on celite .

RESULTS
rt-pcr
microarray analysis
the r and f fractions obtained from watery ripe seeds hybridized also with different intensity with bmy  <dig> gene microarray. an r vs f ratio close to or less than  <dig> was observed for positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> correspondingly. in positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hybridization with r probes was somewhat stronger than with f probes, however the r vs f ratio did not exceed  <dig>  the r vs f ratio was rather high in oligonucleotide positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . finally, in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  the intensity of hybridization with r probe was  <dig> times stronger than with f probe. the highest ratio in the milky ripeness stage  was close to  <dig> in position  <dig>  and slightly exceeded  <dig> in position  <dig>  in all other oligonucleotide positions the r vs f ratio was around  <dig>  thus, similar to the results obtained with amy32b gene, the overall decrease of the r vs f ratio is revealed along the bmy <dig> gene during seed development. the process is more pronounced in exon  <dig> and upstream the microsatellite locus in intron iii.

bioinformatic analysis of amy32b and bmy  <dig> gene sequences
identification of specific areas of tbp binding in both genes raised the question of peculiarities in the gene sequences in these areas. a search for nuclear matrix attachment regions  performed by the matinspector program , revealed a possible mar in intron  <dig> of the bmy <dig> gene . no mars were detected in the amy32b gene. dialign tf, release  <dig>  revealed  <dig> homology regions between the two genes , however no common features in the distribution of transcription factor binding sites along the genes and transcription factor binding modules were revealed. comparison of the predicted mar with the tbp binding sites in the bmy <dig> gene intron  <dig> indicates that this site is enriched in tbps. similar sequences of the two genes differed in their affinity to tbps. the only exception was observed in the area of similarity s9; these sites were tbp-enriched in both genes.

profiling of dna-protein complexes along chromosomes
positive data on intragenic changes in tbp distribution in the course of development encouraged us to upscale the investigation and to study the long-range distribution of tightly bound proteins along barley chromosomes 1h and 7h. lack of barley genome sequence information makes it impossible to apply microarray technology to study long-range distribution of tbps along chromosomes. to at least partly reach the goal we have used the tool of mapped markers well developed in barley studies  <cit> . profiling experiments were designed as pcr-based identification of the dna matrices in dna-protein complexes obtained by different fractionation approaches. involvement of the dna stretch in interactions with a given protein group  was scored in terms of the presence/absence of amplification with mapped markers of barley chromosomes 1h and 7h. data are organized as graphical representations of chromosome 1h and 7h with an indication of the pcr result at each ms locus in all dna-protein fractions analyzed. the study was performed on dna from barley shoot organs; this model enables us to obtain a sufficient quantity of material for fractionation of nuclear structures.

tbps
panel b in figure  <dig> summarizes the trends of transitions during development of different organs compared with the situation in dry seed. panel c gives a summary of the involvement of the chromosome  <dig> h and 7h sites of the r ↔ f transitions. it emerges that all the sites on chromosome 7h are involved, and only four sites of 1h are not involved in the dynamics. thus, the development of the barley seedling is coupled to rearrangements in the interactions of dna with tbps both on chromosome 1h and 7h. the process is organ specific and can be termed "tightening" of the dna-tbp interactions in the leaves and "loosening" in the coleoptile compared to dry seed status.

chromatin fractions and nuclear matrix
npc chromatography
the nucleoprotein chromatography method enables the discrimination of several types of dna-protein interactions in the nucleus including two kinds of dna complexes with nuclear matrix proteins that are not revealed by other approaches. in this method cell lysate is loaded onto a celite column. celite irreversibly binds all proteins including protein moieties of the nucleoproteins. nucleic acids are gradually released from the protein complexes by sequential gradients of nacl, licl-urea and temperature. dna not bound to the nuclear matrix is eluted in a nacl gradient , dna "loosely" bound to the nuclear matrix is released using a licl-urea gradient , high temperature is necessary to release dna from the strong complexes with the nuclear matrix . we suppose that single strand dna breaks in the vicinity of the replication complex induce the transition dnaii – dna i, but double strand breaks release the dna <dig> fraction  <cit> . graphical presentations of chromosomes 1h and 7h  illustrate the results of amplification on the dna purified from the different npc-fractions: dna  <dig>  dna i and dna ii  <cit> . in dry seeds all the 1h markers and most of the 7h markers were revealed in all three chromatographically analyzed fractions. data obtained on both chromosomes, reflect complex patterns of chromatin domain reorganizations after imbibitions. among  <dig> loci tested on 1h, six disappeared from the dna ii fraction . among  <dig> markers used in 7h profiling,  <dig> became involved in looser interactions with the nuclear matrix . development of the first leaf  was accompanied by an increase in loci number associated with the nuclear matrix including ebmac <dig>  bmag <dig>  gbms <dig>  bmag <dig>  gbms <dig>  wmcie <dig> and hvplascib, bmag <dig>  gbms <dig>  bmag <dig> for 1h and 7h correspondingly. several loci became unbound to nm via the strong bond  at the zadoks  <dig> stage. however, in general, senescence of the first leaf was followed by an increase in the sites interacting with the nuclear matrix . interestingly, in zadoks <dig> coleoptiles the profiles of both chromosomes indicate detachment of dna from nuclear matrix or loosening of the dna-nm bonds in most loci tested. only three  and six  loci from  <dig> and  <dig> tested correspondingly for 1h and 7h chromosomes remained tightly attached to the nuclear matrix. most sites of both chromosomes were involved in the rearrangements with two exceptions for each chromosome. .

tightly bound protein spectrum in organs of stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> shoots
affinity of the tbp-bound dna to nuclear proteins
to test changes in the tight dna-protein interactions coupled to plant development we performed dna-binding protein blot assays with electrophoretically fractionated nuclear polypeptides extracted from different barley organs at development stages  <dig> and  <dig> and tbp-bound dna from the stage  <dig> leaves. results are shown in figure  <dig>  nuclear polypeptides isolated from the stage  <dig> coleoptiles manifested high affinity to the tbp-associated dna. both low-molecular weight and  <dig> kda peptides formed tight complexes with dna. transition to stage  <dig> was associated with a decrease of dna-binding proteins, only low-molecular weight proteins could bind to the probe . mostly low molecular weight polypetides extracted from stage  <dig> leaves manifested affinity to the probe, in stage  <dig> leaves these were replaced by  <dig> kda peptides . the tbp-associated dna probe recognized low molecular nuclear polypeptides extracted from the stage  <dig> roots, in extracts from stage  <dig> roots binding to these polypeptides became less intense, however additional  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda polypeptides with affinity to the probe were detected.

discussion
gene expression changes during seed development
in the present study we have revealed development-dependent changes of the tbp distribution in amy32b and bmy <dig> genes during transition of the barley seed from watery-ripe to middle milk ripe stage. changes in tbp distribution in the genes were coupled to changes in their expression. our rt-pcr data confirm earlier published data indicating that β-amylase expression is linked to starchy endosperm development, but α-amylase is not expressed on late seed development stages  <cit> , moreover over-expression of α-amylase in developing seed leads to development defects  <cit> .

tbp redistribution in the amy32b gene
our observation of a decrease in tbp interactions with promoter region of the amy32b gene is in good agreement with a recently proposed hypothesis  <cit> . according to this hypothesis in the dormant gene negative regulators bind to the corresponding cis-acting elements in the promoter and form a "repressosome," this diminishes the binding or transactivating activities of positive regulators to the promoter, thereby preventing amy32b transcription. induction of transcription is followed by binding of positive regulators to their respective dna sequences and formation of the "enhanceosome," leading to a high level of amy32b gene expression. probably, formation of the "enhanceosome" is preceded by degradation of repressors. taking into account that the rt-pcr data expression of the gene is observed exclusively in the watery ripeness stage, one can speculate that tbps could stabilize "enhanceosome", release or degradation of tbps could be one of the mechanisms of the promoter inactivation. interestingly in the dormant bmy 1gene the  <dig> bp region upstream the translation start codon  is neither tbp-enriched. the very organization of the amy32b gene 5' area appears to be favourable for tbp binding, as it contains several inverted sequences  <cit> , but it was shown that repeated sequences are often found in the tbp anchoring sites  <cit> .

tbp redistribution in the bmy <dig> gene
in bmy  <dig> gene, besides the overall decrease of tbp binding coupled to up regulation of transcription we have also observed drastic changes of tbp binding in exon  <dig> and intron  <dig>  changes  <dig>  kb upstream the exon  <dig> were also well-pronounced. interestingly, intron  <dig> of this gene harbours a microsatellite, mite element, several other repeats and a predicted mar . both microsatellites and mobile elements are often involved in tight dna-protein complexes  <cit>  and hence these elements could also possess high affinity to tbps. indeed as position  <dig> of the microarray is very close to the microsatellite, sequences of the mite element should hybridize with the oligonucleotide in the position  <dig>  enrichment of the mobile genomic elements in complexes with tbp was revealed also in our study on the characterization of the tbp-associated dna sequences . on the other hand, the presence of a possible nuclear matrix attachment site  in intron  <dig> of bmy  <dig> gene and the absence of such sequences in other sites of the gene intensively binding tbps indicate that tbp binding is not dependent on the presence of mar.

tbp binding and transcription
the overall intensity of the dna association with tbp appears to be independent of transcription, as in stage  <dig> seeds we observed an overall decrease in the r vs f ratio along both genes, although one of them became expressed on this stage, but the other – remained dormant. triggering or cessation of transcription is rather accompanied by redistribution of tbps along the gene, but not overall accumulation or release of these proteins from the whole gene sequence. the same conclusion was made after a similar study on the chicken produced alpha-globin gene domain  <cit> . comparison of tbp distribution in the domain in erythroid cells differing in the degree of alpha-globin gene transcription revealed changes in distribution of tbps, however the tbps were much more abundant along the domain in dna from liver than in erythrocytes and erythroblasts. thus, in animals overall enrichment in tbps appears to be an organ-specific trait. our results indicate that in plants it could be characteristic not only of the organ per se, but also of the development stage of an organ.

relation between tbp and nuclear matrix attachment sites
application of the microsatellite analysis tool developed for the needs of marker-assisted selection during analysis of long-range dna-protein interactions proved its utility especially for work with a partly sequenced genome like the barley genome. it should be mentioned that using the conventional pcr protocol we could observe only the most drastic changes in the sequence distribution of fractions; a quantitative real-time pcr technique would substantially increase the sensitivity of the approach. nevertheless the assay enabled us to obtain interesting results. for example, the relation between tbp and nuclear matrix binding sites has been discussed for a long time and in some reports these are claimed to be identical structures  <cit> , others consider tbp-dna complexes to be specific structures, not related to nuclear matrix attachment sites  <cit> . comparative study of the changes in distribution of complexes with tbps and the nuclear matrix along chromosomes 1h and 7h in the first leaf of the barley shoots indicates detachment of several sites in both chromosomes of the nuclear matrix during transition from watery to milky ripeness, at the same time the number of interaction with tbps is increased . thus, tbps appear to form complexes different from the nuclear matrix association sites to dna. data from nucleoprotein celite chromatography are coherent with results obtained with salt-extracted nuclear matrices, but reveal the same process in more detail . the presence of a possible mar only in one site of tbp accumulation also indicates the different nature of the two types of dna-protein complexes.

individual peptides of tbp fraction
detailed characterization of the tbp spectrum by means of 2d electrophoresis and mass-spectrometry are currently ongoing. however our preliminary results on development-dependent changes in tbp spectrum reported here are in good agreement with microsatellite analysis data. indeed, we observe some increase in the tbp-binding sites during the transition of the first leaf from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig>  the number of polypeptides in the tbp preparation increases, while in coleoptile we observed a decrease in the tbp binding sites and the peptide spectrum of tbps is also simplified . protein blot assays confirmed the same trend: in nuclear extracts of stage  <dig> coleoptiles several peptides bind tbp-associated dna , in stage  <dig> coleoptiles the only low-molecular peptide, also prominent on electropherograms  retains its ability to form tight complexes with dna.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate the existence of development-dependent redistribution of the tbp along amy32b and bmy <dig> and along studied stretches of chromosomes 1h and 7h in barley. sites of the tbp binding do not co-localize with the nuclear matrix attachment regions. the tbp spectrum and affinity to dna change during plant development.
