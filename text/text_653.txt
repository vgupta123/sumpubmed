BACKGROUND
the indian subcontinent is presently inhabited by four major linguistic groups, viz. austro-asiatic, dravidian, indo-european and tibeto-burman that might have entered at different points of time. based on the observation that austro-asiatic family has the greatest divergence in their nouns  <cit>  and some other linguistic features , it is considered to be the oldest of the four linguistic families  <cit>  and consists of three sub-families  <cit> :  mundari, spoken by a number of tribes inhabiting chota-nagpur plateau in central and eastern india,  mon-khmer, spoken by nicobarese and shompen tribes from andaman and nicobar islands and  khasi-khmuic  represented by only the khasi subtribes from northeast india . the indian khasi-khmuic to a certain extent and mon-khmer groups have physical features of east asian populations  <cit> , whereas the mundari populations have features similar to those of the dravidian linguistic family. further, except the mundari sub-family which is restricted to the indian subcontinent, the languages of the other two sub-families of austro-asiatics are spoken by a large number of populations in southeast asia . however, neither the possibility of any genetic link among the three linguistic branches of indian austro-asiatics, nor that between the indian and southeast asian austro-asiatics has been comprehensively explored till now, despite the fact that the indian subcontinent has been considered to have probably served as an important corridor for migrations to southeast asia.

two routes of migration by which austro-asiatic groups possibly entered the indian subcontinent have been suggested based on the linguistic, archaeological and classical genetic marker  <cit>  and the references therein]; the first being migration from africa to india via central asia, while the second route is from africa to northeast asia and then to the indian subcontinent. basu et al.  <cit>  found high frequency of haplogroup k-m <dig> among the mundari populations and inferred that the austro-asiatic populations have migrated from africa to india via central asia, which is flawed since this haplogroup is ubiquitously found in asia and has a substantial presence in the whole of east asia. on the other hand, from the analysis of mtdna 9bp  del/ins  polymorphisms, thangaraj et al.  <cit>  and prasad et al.  <cit>  reported only east asian-specific mtdna haplogroups in nicobarese, while roychoudury et al.  <cit>  and metspalu et al.  <cit>  found only indian-specific mtdna haplogroups in mundari populations. the above inferences were, however, based on meager genetic evidence and very few austro-asiatic populations  were included in those studies. although kumar et al.  <cit>  analysed a large number of austro-asiatic populations and suggested distinct origins and migration histories of the mundari, khasi-khmuic and mon-khmer populations, the analysis was based only on the mtdna 9bp del/ins polymorphisms and its characterization.

we sampled almost all the austro-asiatic populations of india covering the entire geographic and micro-linguistic heterogeneity inherent among them . this includes molecular genetic data on the austro-asiatic khasi from northeast india, which is considered an important corridor for human migrations to southeast asia. we present results based on the analysis of y-chromosome snp and str data of austro-asiatic tribes along with the previously published data of  <dig> other relevant populations and try to trace the origin and historic expansion of austro-asiatic groups of india. based on this evidence, we propose that haplogroup o-m <dig> has originated in the indian austro-asiatics, particularly among the mundaris, whose ancestors moved further to southeast asia along with this haplogroup.

RESULTS
distribution and frequency of y-chromosome haplogroups
the population-wise distribution of y-haplogroup frequency and diversity along with haplotype diversity based on  <dig> y-str is furnished in table  <dig>  overall, the haplotype diversity is high  and ranges from  <dig> % in pando to 100% in khasi, garo, paharia, nagesia and birijia. out of the  <dig> potential haplogroups defined by the binary markers typed in the present study  nine haplogroups were found among these populations. the average frequency of haplogroup o-m <dig> is highest  followed by h-m <dig> . among the three sub-families of austro-asiatics, on an average, 55% of mundari, 41% of khasi-khmuic from northeast india and all the  <dig> nicobarese samples belong to o-m <dig>  to know if the unclassified o-m <dig> samples have sub-linegaes, we also typed downstream m <dig> binary marker but none showed the presence of o-m <dig> haplogroups. except khasi  and  <dig> sample of korku , none of the indian austro-asiatic populations shows the presence of haplogroup o-m <dig>  further, the garo tribe shows haplogroup o-m <dig> as most common  followed by o-m <dig> . since austro-asiatic khasi and tibeto-burman garo live in close proximity in meghalaya and are known to have frequent marital interactions  <cit> , we further typed all the samples of haplogroup o-m <dig> from garo and khasi populations to see if o-m <dig> among the khasis is not due to admixture with the garo. we found only  <dig> out of the  <dig> haplogroups defined by the binary markers used in this study  i.e. o-m133*, o-m134* and o-m122*. the frequency of o-m134* was highest in both khasi  and garo  followed by o-m133*. three each of khasi and garo out of  <dig> and  <dig> o-m <dig> samples, respectively, remained in the undefined clade o-m122*. thus the khasi and garo show homogeneous distribution of the sub-lineages of o-m <dig> .

analysis of molecular variance and y-str networks
the analysis of molecular variance  based on y-snps  suggests that indian and southeast asian austro-asiatic populations are well differentiated . the fst value is larger by 3% between mundari and southeast asian austro-asiatics indicating relatively higher level of differentiation between them. however, the fst value turns out to be relatively much smaller  between khasi and southeast asian austro-asiatic populations, suggesting greater genetic affinity between them when compared with the khasi affinity to mundari populations . nicobarese were not included in this analysis as all their samples fall in o-m <dig>  amova based on y-strs suggests high fst value  between mundari and khasi, but relatively much smaller when compared to that between khasi and nicobarese  or between mundari and nicobarese .

note.- all the p-values are <  <dig> .

since the entire nicobarese sample falls into single haplogroup, amova based on y-snp was not performed. y-str data for austro-asiatic populations of southeast asia was not available.

the median joining  network based on the  <dig> y-strs of the o-m <dig> samples  depicts two broad and distinct clades, one representing mundari groups and the other khasi and nicobarese populations. although the nicobarese clade is a part of the khasi clade, it consists of two distinct branches suggesting a separate identity. as expected, due to the considerable degree of admixture, the m-j network shows that the garo samples form a part of khasi subclade, not a separate clade. further, the m-j network constructed separately for the sub-haplogroups of o-m <dig> suggests that neither in the case of o-m134*  nor in the case of o-m133*  the garo and khasi samples form distinct clades, suggesting a distinct possibility of gene flow between them.

time to the most recent common ancestor 
since o-m <dig> was found to be the most common haplogroup, we estimated tmrca for this lineage with the help of batwing program  <cit>  and using  <dig> y-strs. we chose the demographic model with an exponential growth from an initially constant-sized population with sub-division. although there are other  <dig> models, the demographic model chosen for this study is considered to be the most appropriate  <cit>  for human populations; this model assumes that population sizes were constant until they became semi-sedentary or sedentary, probably till the advent of agriculture, which was followed by an exponential growth. . the median estimate of tmrca  with  <dig> mcmc cycles for the whole of austro-asiatic groups turns out to be ~ <dig>  ybp . the tmrca for the mundari  and khasi  is similar, whereas for nicobarese it is considerably lower . further, the average of tmrca estimated for individual mundari and transitional populations turns out to be large , ranging from ~ <dig>  ybp to ~ <dig>  ybp , suggesting that the haplogroup o-m <dig> might have originated early, possibly in the paleolithic period.

haplogroup isofrequency maps
isofrequency maps were generated for all the haplogroups but only the relevant two maps pertaining to o-m <dig> and o-m <dig> are presented in figure  <dig>  the data of our study along with the comparative data on  <dig> other relevant populations suggest that the haplogroup o-m <dig> is ubiquitously found in southeast asia, while in india it is restricted to the regions where austro-asiatic populations are found. this strongly suggests that austro-asiatic populations of india are not only linguistically linked to southeast asian populations but also genetically associated. the present day distribution of austro-asiatic linguistic groups and the distribution of haplogroup o-m <dig> appear to be highly correlated . for example, its average frequency is only  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively, in northeast and central asia where no austro-asiatic population is found, whereas it is much higher in southeast asian austro-asiatics  as well as in the neighboring non-austro-asiatics . further, this frequency is significantly much higher in austro-asiatics than in non-austro-asiatics . there is also a decreasing gradient of o-m <dig> frequency as we move from india to southeast asia, although this trend is less apparent in the map because  <dig> of  <dig> groups from southeast asia show o-m <dig> frequency in the range of 50% to 75%. however, for six of those  <dig> populations the sample sizes are less than  <dig>  some being very small. in any case, the average frequency of o-m <dig> in indian austro-asiatic populations is much higher  when compared  to those of southeast asia, whether austro-asiatic  or non-austro-asiatic . on the other hand, haplogroup o-m <dig> distribution in india is confined only to the northeast india, as depicted in the map by a sharp boundary , whereas it is equally prevalent in northeast and southeast asia . the spread of haplogroup h-m <dig>  appears to be confined to the boundaries of the indian subcontinent and, therefore, very strongly suggests its origin in the indian subcontinent.

discussion
a common genetic heritage of the austro-asiatic groups
mundari populations show o-m <dig> as the most common haplogroup and only three of the  <dig> populations – lodha, savara and mahali- show departure from this general trend , which appears to be because of their disputed origin  <cit> . this haplogroup is also found in a relatively high frequency in the khasi and nicobarese. it is therefore not surprising that in a recent study  <cit>  all the  <dig> samples of shompen from nicobar islands, like their own linguistic neighbors from the region, the nicobarese, showed o-m <dig>  this may underscore that the mundari, khasi-khmuic and mon-khmer groups of india are not only linguistically related but also genetically linked, probably with a single but relatively broad paternal genetic source. this haplogroup has been reported to be absent or present in low frequency in other linguistic groups of india  <cit> , suggesting a distinct genetic identity of the indian austro-asiatic populations. on the other hand, while the austro-asiatic populations of southeast asia show high frequency of o-m <dig>  their neighboring populations also show considerable frequency . however, this haplogroup has negligible presence in north and central asia . thus the predominance of this haplogroup both in austro-asiatic populations of india and southeast asia and its absence/negligible presence in other asian populations suggests a common genetic heritage of the people of this linguistic family.

the virtual absence of o-m <dig> in the tibeto-burman populations of india  <cit>  suggests that the migrations of these populations into india were not accompanied by the o-m <dig> haplogroup. therefore, the presence of this haplogroup in the garo tribe of meghalaya is due to high degree of gene flow from the neighboring khasi, which has been facilitated by the matrilocal system of marriage among these two tribes  <cit> . similarly, the presence of haplogroup o-m <dig> in the austro-asiatic khasi with relatively high frequency  could be suspected to be due to gene flow from the neighboring garo, which is substantiated by a similar frequency and composition of subclades of o-m <dig> between them . concurrently, no separate y-str lineages could be identified in the m-j network within the subclades . the comparative data suggests that southeast asian austro-asiatics near the northeast border of india  <cit>  have either o-m133* or o-m134* subclades , whereas majority of the austro-asiatic populations from geographically distant southeast china and cambodia  <cit>  have o-m <dig> subclade , suggesting that the austro-asiatic populations of different regions have different subclades of o-m <dig>  which are characteristic of the neighboring non-austro-asiatic groups, possibly due to extensive admixture. therefore, the presence of o-m133* and/or o-m134* subclades in the austro-asiatic khasi and other tibeto-burman populations  <cit>  including garo from northeast india may imply that the o-m <dig> in khasi probably had its source in the neighboring tibeto-burman groups, particularly from the garo. although the foregoing analysis suggests that the austro-asiatic populations of india share common genetic ties, a comparative analysis among the sub-families suggests that these populations have separated quite early and are now well differentiated as indicated by the results of amova , the m-j network  and the tmrca .

origin of haplogroup o-m <dig> and expansion of austro-asiatic populations
given the overwhelmingly high frequency of o-m <dig> in the austro-asiatic populations it is most likely that this haplogroup has originated among them. however, the question is whether it has its origin in india or southeast asia? the most likely region of origin of a haplogroup can be identified on the basis of two characteristics – the highest frequency and the highest diversity  <cit> . the maximum frequency of o-m <dig> among the  <dig> southeast asian austro-asiatic populations is only 35% after excluding  <dig> populations with small sample size. on the other hand, the sample size for mundari populations is generally large  and the frequency of the haplogroup ranges from 39%–98% with an average of 63% , which is significantly higher compared to that of the southeast asian austro-asiatics . furthermore, the haplotype diversity among the mundari populations is as high as 99%. given this and the fact that this haplogroup is nearly absent in other parts of india as well as in western and central asia, one may safely conclude that o-m <dig> has originated in mundari populations roughly around  <dig>  ybp , as suggested by tmrca. therefore, the ancestors of present day mundari populations must have come to india prior to the origin of haplogroup o-m <dig>  probably in the pleistocene era. this is consistent with the archeological evidence, which suggest human habitation in mainland india during early paleolithic times  <cit> .

kayser et al.  <cit> , however, suggested southeast asian origin of haplogroup o-m <dig>  implying migration of austro-asiatic populations from southeast asia to india. based on the presence of east asian mtdna haplogroups, kumar et al.  <cit>  and thangaraj et al.  <cit>  suggested that the non-mundari austro-asiatic groups of india  have migrated from southeast asia. however, no such maternal genetic link between the mundari tribes  <cit> , and those of southeast asia was found. further, our analysis of  <dig> samples representing most of the mundari tribes, including the transitional groups, shows total absence of east asian mtdna haplogroups [kumar v, reddy bm and langstieh bt, unpublished results), suggesting different maternal genetic histories of the three sub-families of austro-asiatics of india as compared to the common paternal genetic history outlined earlier. how do we account for this discrepancy? since all the sub-families of austro-asiatics have a common paternal genetic link in haplogroup o-m <dig>  which is absent in the case of mtdna, a predominantly male driven migration of austro-asiatic populations appears to be a strong possibility. however, and most importantly, haplogroup o-m <dig>  which is considered to be the signature haplogroup of southeast asian populations, is absent among the mundari populations, whereas any inference on the migration of populations from southeast asia is principally based on the presence of haplogroup o-m <dig>  <cit> . the age estimated for haplogroup o-m <dig> is between  <dig> – <dig>  ybp  <cit>  whereas it is ~ <dig>  ybp for o-m <dig> in southeast asia  <cit> . therefore, if indeed indian austro-asiatic populations would have migrated from southeast asia, then they should have shown the presence of haplogroup o-m <dig>  and/or the tmrca estimated for o-m <dig> among the mundaris of india should have been much lower  than what has been obtained , although given the large confidence interval.  this estimate needs to viewed with caution. nevertheless, the lower bound of our estimate for the mundari is still higher and non-overlapping with the upper limit obtained by kayser et al.  <cit> . since kayser et al.  <cit>  have used relatively higher mutation rates and only  <dig> of the  <dig> loci, we reanalyzed our data based on those  <dig> loci and the mutation rate used by kayser et al.  <cit>  and observed a similar tmrca  suggesting that the tmrca of the present study may not be an artifact of large number of loci and low mutation rate. furthermore, the mundari populations are considered to be traditionally hunters and food-gatherers and at present they inhabit the areas unfit for cultivation, which may reflect their traditional mode of subsistence. therefore, migration of mundari populations during demic expansion of the agriculturalists in the neolithic era appears improbable as has been suggested for nicobarese  <cit> . based on these evidences, we suggest that the ancestors of present day mundari populations have migrated to southeast asia instead of coming from southeast asia. this scenario is also consistent with the inference that mundari language is grammatically and phonologically the most conservative branch of the austro-asiatic family  <cit>  and more similar to proto-austroasiatics than the other branches of this family suggesting that linguistic ancestors of the mundari populations have originated in india  <cit> . the foregoing analysis therefore suggests in-situ origin of o-m <dig> haplogroup, most probably in the ancestors of present day mundari populations, who might have carried it further to southeast asia.

the results of amova , m-j network  and tmrca of haplogroup o-m <dig>  suggest an early separation of mundari and other austro-asiatic populations. due to this early separation, we expected that at least in one of these groups sublineage of o-m <dig> might have originated. however, none of the groups showed the sublineage o-m <dig> . till now this lineage has been reported from the region of cambodia and laos only in  <dig> sample  <cit>  suggesting probably that this lineage is present with a very low frequency and is probably originated and confined to that region. therefore, if the sublineage exists, it is probably identified by some other binary marker which is yet to be known. since the khasi shows relatively high frequency of o-m <dig>  and given that populations of khasi-khmuic sub-family are concentrated in the regions north of burma and thailand , one may suspect that khasi-khmuic populations have migrated from southeast asia to india. however, the presence of o-m <dig> in the khasi is observed to be due to gene flow from the neighboring garo, suggesting that this population was initially devoid of this haplogroup. moreover, indian mtdna haplogroups constitute 30% of the mtdna motifs of the khasi subtribes, , which are practically absent in their tibeto-burman neighbors  <cit> . therefore, the presence of east asian mtdna among the khasi could be due to gene flow from the neighboring garo and the other tibeto-burman populations which have virtually only east asian mtdna haplogroups. this may reinforce the suggestion that mundari and khasi-khmuic populations have separated long back and the latter have probably gone to southeast asia, via the northeast indian corridor, as reflected in their geographic distribution .

the nicobarese is also quite distinct from both the mundari and khasi-khmuic tribes as revealed by the amova  and m-j network  based on y-strs. this tribe has only east asian female lineages  <cit>  and only o-m <dig> as male lineages . we also performed amova based on the same set of  <dig> y-str for shompen tribe  <cit> , which is also a mon-khmer group. the results suggest that shompen like the nicobarese are also quite distinct from the mundari  and the khasi . the tmrca of nicobarese  and the shompen , and the distribution of mon-khmer populations , which is confined to lower part of burma and thailand, vietnam and cambodia suggest that they have migrated from southeast asia to india during demic expansion of the agriculturalists in the neolithic era  <cit> . the complete absence of o-m <dig> among them appears to be due to the profound impact of founder effect and subsequent genetic drift, although the ascertainment bias due to small sample size cannot be ruled out.

two possible routes of entry of austro-asiatics into the indian subcontinent
kumar and reddy  <cit>  suggested the possibility of ancestors of indian austro-asiatic tribes having migrated from africa to india via either northeast asia through the northeast indian corridor or via central asia through its western indian corridor. the sister-clade of haplogroup o-m <dig>  i.e. haplogroup n-lly22g, is confined only to northeast asia including russia and siberia  and is absent or found in negligibly low frequency in central, south and southeast asia. similarly, the haplogroup o-m <dig> and its subclades are either absent or found in low frequency in south  and central asia, while it is present in whole of east asia. two alternative scenarios can be envisaged: 1) it appears that the modern man had probably migrated from africa to northeast asia via central asia, where the haplogroups n-lly22g and o-m <dig> might have originated  <cit> . subsequently, populations carrying haplogroup o-m <dig> might have migrated to india, where haplogroup o-m <dig> could have originated and later on spread to southeast asia. however, since 100% of the mundari populations and 30% of the khasi samples show indian-specific mtdna whereas all the southeast asian austro-asiatic populations have east asian-specific mtdna only  <cit> , this migration could have been primarily male driven. 2) in view of this, the possibility of ancestors of austro-asiatics migrating from central asia to india through the western indian corridor cannot be discounted, as it can account for the presence of contrasting patterns of mtdna in the indian and southeast asian austro-asiatics. although neither haplogroup o-m <dig> nor n-lly22g has been reported from central asia, many studies have observed reasonably high frequency of haplogroup k-m9*  <cit>  and it is possible that these samples may fall in the haplogroup defined by the binary marker m <dig>  which connects haplogroups 'o' and 'n'  <cit> . however, this marker has not been typed in the central asian populations. a section of the population might have migrated towards northeast asia where haplogroup 'n' originated and another wave towards south asia and entered india through its western corridor wherein haplogroup o-m <dig> originated. haplogroup o-m <dig> might have evolved subsequently as a predominant male lineage along with the indian-specific female lineages. subsequently, a primarily male-driven and rapid migration of these people to southeast asia via northeast india might have resulted in the total absence of indian-specific mtdna haplogroups but presence of 100% east asian motifs in the southeast asian austro-asiatics. the age estimation of fossils of anatomically modern man excavated from east asia is not older than  <dig>  ybp  <cit> , which may imply that the earliest possible migration of austro-asiatic populations to southeast asia is about  <dig>  ybp or later. therefore, the mundari populations appear to be one of the earliest source of populations from which the khasi-khmuic and mon-khmer populations have separated quite early and migrated to and settled in southeast asia, while another wave of migration, much later, by the mon-khmer people from southeast asia through thailand and coastal southern burma to andaman and nicobar islands can be inferred from the current spread of mon-khmer populations .

CONCLUSIONS
to sum up we conclude that, because of its very high frequency and diversity, haplogroup o-m <dig> had an in-situ origin among the indian austro-asiatics, particularly among the mundaris, not in southeast asia as envisaged earlier. given the large estimate of tmrca, our study suggests that the mundari populations are one of the earliest settlers in the indian subcontinent. it is most likely that these populations have come from central asia through the western indian corridor and subsequently colonized southeast asia, although more data on y-chromosome and mtdna are needed from other relevant populations to draw firmer conclusions.
