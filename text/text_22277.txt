BACKGROUND
the central role that the primary cell wall plays in regulating extension growth, cell adhesion and cell morphology, requires a tight temporal-spatial regulation of its rheological properties, which are ultimately determined by matrix composition and structure. most current primary cell wall models agree that the major wall polymers are bound to each other largely non-covalently, although physically intertwined  <cit> . in these models, hemicellulose is associated with cellulose through hydrogen bonding and physical entrapment, and pectins form a relatively mobile gel around the cellulose-hemicellulose network or between cellulose-hemicellulose lamellae  <cit> . in some tissues of dicotyledons, extensins are abundant and are also thought to play an important role in primary wall biosynthesis  <cit>  and to contribute to their structural properties  <cit> . although the composition and structure of the major matrix polymers in dicotyledons have been well characterised, understanding how changes in polymer compositions and their interactions in the matrix nanostructure relate with changes in wall properties remains a challenge.

plant cell expansion is ultimately driven by turgor pressure, but controlled by the cell wall ability to yield to tension stress  <cit> . wall stress-relaxation during the integration of newly synthesised material into the matrix requires the co-ordinate action of matrix modifying enzymes including expansin  <cit> , xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase   <cit> , a variety of glycosyl hydrolases and possibly some class iii peroxidases through hydroxyl radical production and the resultant scission of wall polysaccharides  <cit> .

to oppose relaxation, the regulation of extension growth is thought to involve processes leading to a loss of wall plasticity, rather than a loss of turgor pressure  <cit> . such processes include processive pectin methyl esterases which demethylate homogalacturonans  to promote ca2+ bridging and rigidification  <cit> . a borate diester cross-link between rhamnogalacturonan-ii chains, which contributes to the tensile strength has been described . in dicotyledons, there is evidence for the covalent cross-linking of pectin to xyloglucan  <cit>  and pectin to the extensin network  <cit> , which might also contribute. class iii peroxidases are also regarded as potentially important cell wall stiffening enzymes  <cit> , since peroxidase/h2o2-driven reactions may fix the viscoelastically extended cell wall through phenolic cross-linking  <cit> , which can occur between feruloylated pectins  <cit>  or extensins  <cit> .

cell adhesion has been less studied, but there is evidence that this occurs primarily at the edges of cell faces bordering intercellular corners, rather than across the entire wall face  <cit> . the corners of intercellular faces thus formed can contain weakly esterified hgs  <cit> , which can be cross-linked by ca2+, leading to greater adhesive strength  <cit> . support for this comes from recent descriptions of the arabidopsis tsd2/qua <dig> mutant, which is defective in a putative golgi-based  methyl transferase gene and shows a reduction in both hg content  <cit>  and cell adhesion  <cit> . extensin is also present in the intercellular spaces at cell corners in some tissues  <cit> . these structural proteins electrostatically interact with hgs, promoting pectin gelation  <cit> , and are thought to promote further matrix rigidification after extensin network formation  <cit> , with possible consequences to the strength of intercellular adhesion.

a further important, but often overlooked constituent of the cell wall is water, which can constitute ca. 75% of its weight and confers the properties of a relatively dense gel to the matrix  <cit> . cell wall water content has been shown to have a direct effect on hypocotyl extensibility in sunflower  <cit> . studies with dicotyledons have demonstrated that changes in cell wall hydration primarily affects the mobility of pectins and a minor fraction of the xyloglucan network, while cellulose and more tightly bound forms of xyloglucan remain as typical, rigid solids  <cit> . although it is not yet clear if the relatively mobile pectin network can resist stresses in the plane of the wall, a decrease in the mobility of methyl-esterified pectin has been correlated with growth cessation in celery collenchyma  <cit> . it has also been suggested that pectins and xyloglucans could regulate the matrix free volume and viscosity to control microfibril realignment and extension growth  <cit> . alterations to pectin mobility, through either changes in hydration or the formation of cross-links, could therefore be important to matrix and cell adhesive properties during development.

primary cell walls are negatively charged at physiological ph due to the high abundance of charged hgs. the polyelectrolyte nature of hg-rich areas of the matrix can drive wall swelling through a donnan effect, where increased hydration would occur as the concentration of endogenous counterions, such as ca++, mg++ and k+ are reduced in the apoplastic space  <cit> . demethylation of hgs by pectin methyl esterases  <cit>  can increase charge density in the matrix and therefore drive increased hydration. conversely, the formation of calcium-pectate bridges may constrain matrix swelling  <cit> . in addition, the electrostatic interaction of basic peptides with pectins can increase pectin gelation by reducing pectin charge and hydration  <cit> , indicating that the electrostatic interaction of wall proteins with the matrix is important.

extensins can be abundant in dicotyledon primary cell walls . these structural proteins have a poly pro-like configuration giving them a rod-like shape in solution  <cit> , which can reach 50- <dig> nm in length  <cit> . the presence of highly periodic lys-containing motifs in the primary structures of typical extensins promotes their electrostatic interaction with hgs  <cit> , with possible consequences to pectin mobility and wall matrix swelling.

monomeric extensin can also be covalently cross-linked within the extracellular matrix to an insoluble extensin network by a h2o2/peroxidase-mediated process  <cit> , thought to be mediated by particular class iii peroxidases referred to as extensin-peroxidases   <cit> .

electron microscopy studies of the primary cell wall in onion have indicated thin walls, ca.  <dig> nm thick, composed of 3- <dig> laminae of 8- <dig> nm thick microfibrils coated with xyloglucan, and spaced 20- <dig> nm apart  <cit> . consistently, recent afm studies of potato cell walls have indicated an interfiber spacing of  <dig> nm  <cit> . these dimensions suggest that monomeric extensin can span inter-microfibrillar distances, and it is therefore conceivable that the formation of network extensin could help lock the major wall polymers to increase cell wall rigidity  <cit> . in fact, several studies suggest that extensin network formation is important for a wide range of plant physiological processes, including correct primary cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> , cell adhesion and morphology  <cit> , growth cessation  <cit>  and disease resistance  <cit> . however, experimental data describing the effects of extensin network on primary wall properties has been lacking.

we have selected a grapevine callus line containing high amounts of monomeric extensin  in the cell wall, which is insolubilised after the addition of h2o <dig> in a reaction exclusively catalysed by the ep, gvep <dig>  <cit> . these cells provide a convenient system to evaluate the contribution of specific cell wall proteins, such as extensin and ep, to rapid, h2o2-mediated changes in cell wall properties. using this system, we have demonstrated that extensin network formation drives a rapid increase in resistance to fungal lytic enzymes  <cit> . here, we report that h2o <dig> can rapidly reduce the hydration and thickness of primary dicotyledon cell walls, and that extensin network formation is the primary and causal event in this process.

RESULTS
rapid, h2o2-mediated effects on cell wall hydration and thickness
the swelling behaviour of isolated cell walls from grapevine callus in solution with 0- <dig> mm kcl at ph  <dig>  is typical of a weak polyelectrolyte . a donnan-type effect is observed in that cell wall swelling increases as the concentration of the counterion is reduced; an effect which is more pronounced for values below  <dig> mm kcl.

following incubation with  <dig> Î¼m h2o <dig> at ph  <dig>  for  <dig> min, these walls retained the capacity to show increased swelling at reduced kcl concentrations, but demonstrated a remarkable reduction in hydration at all kcl concentrations , indicating a rapid and h2o2-mediated formation of a denser matrix.

in order to determine if the changes in hydration occurred with alteration in cell wall dimensions, their thicknesses were measured by fast-freeze scanning electron microscopy . the measurements suggested the apparent cell wall thickness varied substantially between samples, possibly due to the occasional difficulty of identifying wall limits and of obtaining views precisely perpendicular to the cell wall plane. nevertheless, measurements indicated that native cell walls at  <dig> mm kcl were on average ca.  <dig> nm thick . the presence of  <dig> or  <dig> mm kcl resulted in a significant reduction to  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively . the incubation of cells pre-equilibrated in  <dig> mm kcl with h2o <dig> resulted in the formation of cell walls on average ca. 25% thinner, at  <dig> nm .

h2o2-induced reduction in cell wall hydration is accompanied by gvp <dig> network formation
we have previously reported that grapevine callus cells contained high levels of a single monomeric extensin, gvp <dig>  <cit> , which is uniformly distributed as a monomer in the lateral walls  <cit> . no other extensins were detected in extracts of these cells, and saline extraction of walls resulted in the near complete removal of jim <dig> epitope signals, indicating minor, if any network extensin prior to incubation with h2o <dig>  to determine if h2o2-mediated reduction in cell wall hydration occurred with extensin network formation, extracellular, ionically bound matrix proteins  from native and h2o2-treated cell walls  were compared by superose- <dig>  gel-filtration chromatography . the chromatograms demonstrate that incubation with  <dig> Î¼m h2o <dig> at ph  <dig>  leads to the insolubilisation of a major protein peak  eluting at  <dig>  ml. the time course of gvp <dig> insolubilisation was followed by monitoring changes in the peak height of gvp <dig> over time, and ca. 60% insolubilisation of gvp <dig> was seen to occur within  <dig> min .

sp-sepharose chromatography  of saline extracts and trichloroacetic acid precipitation of selected fractions  enabled the recovery of purified gvp <dig> from the supernatant . maldi-tof analysis of gvp <dig> indicated a molecular mass of  <dig> kda, without any significant additional mass signals, indicating purity . the amino acid composition of gvp <dig> is typical of dicotyledon extensins . furthermore, a comparison of the amino acid composition of saline-extracted cell walls before and after h2o <dig> treatment demonstrated that the insolubilisation of gvp <dig> occurs with an increase in the major amino acids of gvp <dig> extensin in the saline-insoluble, cell wall structure , confirming its incorporation into the wall matrix as an insoluble network. quantitatively, gvp <dig> extensin network was calculated to contribute â¥  <dig> %  in control cell walls, but ca. 6%  of the cell wall weight after incubation with  <dig> Î¼m h2o <dig> over  <dig> min.

the amino acid  composition of pure grapevine extensin, gvp <dig> , is shown for comparison. the content of each amino acid in wall preparations was measured after saline extraction to remove saline-soluble eibmps and is given in nmole.mg- <dig>  cell wall. the less abundant amino-acids of gvp <dig> are omitted for clarity.

gvp <dig> displays characteristics typical of extensins
to determine if gvp <dig> is a typical extensin, homology-based cloning  was utilised to isolate a 5' truncated extensin cdna from grapevine callus. all ten clones sequenced encoded the extensin primary structure depicted in figure 4a, or truncated versions of the same. this supports earlier results indicating the expression of a single extensin in these cells  <cit> . cyanogen bromide cleavage of purified gvp <dig> enabled the isolation of two internal peptides  which were sequenced by edman degradation. both sequences could be localised within the extensin cdna obtained , confirming that it corresponded to gvp <dig>  the sequence of gvp <dig> contains motifs typical of dicotyledon extensins, including repeats of structural ser  <dig> motifs, as well as tyr-lys-tyr-lys and pro-pro-val-tyr-lys motifs believed to be required for the intra- and inter-crosslinking of extensin in muro  <cit> . however, an unusual sequence characteristic of gvp <dig> is the variable extension of the ser  <dig> motif to ser 4- <dig>  resulting in a lack of the high frequency sequence periodicity present in many extensins  <cit> . further evidence for gvp <dig> as a typical dicotyledon extensin comes from the maldi-tof/ms analysis of the  <dig> a.a. glycopeptide, p <dig> . this peptide demonstrates a considerable mass heterogeneity, but with periodicities of  <dig> and  <dig> da. this can be clearly attributed to the expected heterogeneity in proline hydroxylation  and hydroxyproline arabinosylation  in extensins.

saline-eluted walls regain their ability to reduce hydration in response to h2o <dig> when reconstituted with eibmps
gvp <dig> network formation and changes in cell wall hydration were studied over time. these and all subsequent measurements of hydration were made at  <dig> mm kcl, where h2o2-mediated differences in hydration were marked. in native cell walls, > 60% of monomeric gvp <dig> was insolubilised after  <dig> min incubation with h2o <dig> with a ca. 50% reduction in cell wall hydration. longer times of incubation resulted in higher levels of network formation and lower levels of cell wall hydration , suggesting a causal relationship.

importantly, the removal of eibmps by saline extraction was seen to increase hydration in control  cell walls, suggesting that the electrostatic interaction of endogenous matrix proteins with the wall is also an important determinant of wall hydration. following h2o2-mediated partial dehydration, saline extraction was also seen to increase wall hydration, although to a significantly less extent to that seen after the saline extraction of control cell walls .

saline-extracted native walls showed no significant change in hydration in response to h2o <dig> or h2o <dig> plus ascorbate , indicating that the presence of eibmps in muro was essential for h2o2-mediated changes in hydration.

in order to examine the role of specific eibmps in h2o2-mediated cell wall dehydration, we manipulated endogenous levels of selected eibmps, including gvp <dig>  in muro. saline-extracted grapevine callus walls  retained the capacity to bind endogenous levels of total eibmps  and gvp <dig> . the binding of non-extensin eibmps  is shown in additional file 1c-d. this suggests that we can bind endogenous levels of selected eibmps to saline-extracted cell walls and assay for changes in hydration in response to added h2o <dig> 

the use of similarly high salt conditions partially dissociates the pea xyloglucan-pectin interaction  <cit> , suggesting this treatment could irreversibly alter the structure and/or composition of grapevine callus cell walls, with possible consequences to wall hydration. analyses of neutral monosaccharide and uronic acid contents of different cell wall isolates  did in fact indicate that saline extraction led to some loss of pectin . however, despite this apparent loss, the increase in wall hydration observed after saline-extraction could be completely reversed by the replacement of eibmps to endogenous levels . the incubation of these manipulated cell walls with h2o <dig> resulted in both extensin network formation  and a decrease in hydration  to levels comparable to those observed after h2o2-treatment of native cell walls .

rha = rhamnose; fuc = fucose; xyl = xylose; man = mannose; gal = galactose, glc = glucose and ua = uronic acid.

the effects of the interaction of eibmps with the wall matrix interaction on hydration appear to be concentration dependent, since the addition of higher levels  of eibmps resulted in a greater reduction in hydration prior to, and following h2o <dig> treatment. as in native cell walls, h2o2-mediated dehydration could be only partially reversed by the extraction of eibmps from the matrix by saline elution .

endogenous eibmps therefore must play an important role in determining the level of hydration in primary cell walls, through both their electrostatic interaction with the matrix and their apparent role in the further reduction of wall hydration in response to h2o <dig>  these data also confirm that we can extract eibmps with high salt solutions, and subsequently re-bind them to the wall matrix, without irreversibly altering the wall's capacity to reduce hydration in response to h2o <dig>  this convenient experimental system was therefore used to investigate the role of specific eibmps in this process.

effects of extensin network formation on wall hydration is reduced in the absence of other eibmps
the addition of purified gvp <dig> alone, or together with the extensin peroxidase, gvep <dig>  to saline-extracted cell walls was effective in reducing wall hydration to levels found in native cells . no deposition of gvp <dig> was detected in response to h2o <dig> in cell walls without the extensin peroxidase, gvep <dig>  where gvep <dig> was present, h2o <dig> treatment resulted in the deposition of ca. 65% of extensin . however, the extensin network formation in these walls was not accompanied by any significant reduction in hydration . similarly, the addition of gvp1-free eibmps to saline-extracted walls reduced hydration to control levels, but no change in hydration was seen after the addition of h2o <dig>  this is in contrast to the substantial reduction in wall hydration  obtained after h2o <dig> incubation of walls containing total, eibmps  and strongly suggests that the presence of eibmps other than gvp <dig> and gvep <dig> is a pre-requisite for h2o2-induced reduction in wall hydration.

nevertheless, whereas saline-extraction of untreated native walls resulted in substantial swelling, saline extraction after extensin network formation resulted in significantly less swelling. this smaller increase in hydration after extensin network formation was seen after h2o <dig> treatment of native walls , or in saline extracted walls where either total eibmps or extensin and gvep <dig> had been replaced . this effect was restricted to walls which contained network gvp <dig>  since saline extraction of h2o2-treated walls containing gvp1-free eibmps swelled to hydration levels similar to that observed after saline extraction of native walls . the formation of the extensin network can therefore be considered to be effective in restraining further cell wall swelling.

the addition of eibmps to gvp <dig> network-containing walls mimics h2o <dig> effects on wall hydration
to further investigate how the gvp <dig> network and other eibmps contribute to h2o2-mediated reduction in wall hydration, walls were prepared containing control levels of network gvp <dig>  but free from non-extensin eibmps. in one approach, this was achieved by saline extraction of h2o2-treated native cell walls. the extensin network in such walls was, as a consequence, formed in the presence of endogenous eibmps . the successful re-attachment of endogenous levels of eibmps ) obtained from h2o2-incubated native walls  markedly reduced the cell wall hydration to ca. 55% , i.e. to levels comparable to that observed after the incubation of native walls with h2o <dig>  quantitatively similar results  were also obtained after the addition of endogenous levels of gvp1-free eibmps obtained after fractionation of saline eluates of native cell walls, clearly indicating that non-extensin eibmps do not require reaction with h2o <dig> to be effective. similar data was obtained in a second approach, where the extensin network was formed in saline-extracted cell walls, i.e. in the absence of other eibmps . these cell walls also contracted to ca. 50% volume after the addition of endogenous levels of whole, or gvp1-depleted eibmps.

hydrogen peroxide-mediated reduction in primary wall hydration therefore appears to require extensin network formation, but is influenced by the electrostatic interaction of eibmps with the wall matrix.

in an attempt to define the nature of the non-extensin eibmps involved, heat and dtt-resistant proteins of saline extracts were isolated and assayed in extensin network-containing walls, and found able to reduce hydration to levels comparable to that achieved with total eibmps . saline-extracted cell walls were also able to bind  <dig> Î¼g. mg- <dig> cell wall  of medicago leaf cell wall proteins. as shown in additional file 1d, the chromatographic profile of these saline-soluble proteins was not altered by incubation of the walls with h2o <dig>  suggesting the absence of abundant cross-linking structural proteins. poly-l-arginine  could also be bound to saline-extracted walls at  <dig> Î¼g. mg- <dig> cell wall . for both medicago cell wall proteins and poly-l-arginine, these added quantities reduced the wall hydration of saline-extracted walls to levels similar to that of native walls , and no significant changes in hydration were detected in response to h2o <dig> . however, when the same amounts were added to extensin network containing walls, cell wall hydration was reduced to ca 50% and 40%, respectively . no significant binding was obtained with poly-l-aspartic acid , indicating the absence of cell wall sites for the ionic interaction with negatively charged polypeptides.

extensin effects on matrix hydration can be important in lateral walls and cell junctions
the effect of extensin network formation on primary wall hydration suggests that this post-translational process could impart important biophysical changes to extracellular matrix materials during development. grapevine callus cell walls appear to have a monosaccharide composition typical of primary cell walls and gvp <dig> displays characteristics of dicotyledon extensins in general , suggesting the effect that network gvp <dig> has on primary wall hydration might also occur in other extensin-bearing primary cell walls during plant development.

as indicated in earlier studies of root apexes of carrot and onion  <cit> , extensin is not present in all primary cell walls, but is targeted to possibly strengthen specific apoplastic regions at different developmental stages  <cit> . this was further illustrated here using the anti-extensin monoclonal antibody, jim <dig>  to probe the distribution of extensin in grapevine callus and plantlets .

in agreement with previous results  <cit> , the extensin gvp <dig> could be detected in the lateral cell walls of grapevine callus by jim <dig> . to test whether the cell plate also contained jim11-reactive epitopes, thin-slice  sections of resin-fixed callus were studied, where the cell plate was exposed . however, no jim <dig> epitopes could be detected in this structure. the expression of gvp <dig> extensin in these cells therefore appears to be restricted to lateral walls.

in grapevine plantlets, jim <dig> epitopes were readily detectable in epicotyls, where they were limited to cell corners of cortical parenchyma . in mature root sections, jim <dig> signals were also detected in parenchyma cell-cell junctions, but were restricted to the epidermis and adjacent sub-epidermal cortical layers . in the root cap, jim <dig> epitopes were mostly located in internal cell layers, where they occupied often large intercellular spaces , but were also clearly present in some cell walls .

these observations confirm that extensin is targeted in grapevine to specific cell walls and/or cell corners, where it is likely to provide localised, structural support to tissues. the effect of extensin network formation on the hydration level of the extracellular matrix reported here suggests that extensin can provide such support through the dehydration of extracellular materials, with resultant formation of denser and more rigid matrix properties.

discussion
we have demonstrated that h2o <dig> causes a rapid and marked decrease in the hydration of grapevine callus primary walls, concomitant with a significant decrease in wall thickness. h2o <dig> is known to play an important role in regulating extension growth  <cit>  and the mechanical properties of tissues  <cit>  by driving  phenolic cross-linking of wall constituents, but to our knowledge, this is the first report that it can effect rapid changes in primary wall hydration.

an analysis of cell wall proteins of grapevine callus revealed that h2o2-mediated reduction in wall hydration occurred with a marked increase in extensin network levels from minor levels  to ca. 6%  of the cell wall matrix on a dry weight basis. extensin network formation in these primary walls appears to be formed exclusively from the cross-linking of gvp <dig>  <cit> . this is supported here by the amplification of a single extensin cdna from these cells using a heterologous primer corresponding to a common motif in dicotyledon extensins. two peptide sequences from gvp <dig> could be mapped to this cdna, confirming its identity.

gvp <dig> is an abundant protein which displays properties typical of dicotyledon extensins, including repeats of structural ser- <dig> motifs, interspersed with short  tyr-rich sequences, thought to participate in both intramolecular isodityrosine formation  <cit>  and intermolecular extensin oligomerisation  <cit> . maldi-tof analyses of gvp1-derived peptides also indicated post-translational modifications typical of extensins, including hydroxylation and arabinosylation of proline residues. these findings initially suggest that extensin network formation could contribute to h2o2-mediated reductions in the hydration of primary cell walls.

studies of extensin during seed coat cell maturation  <cit> , of its impact on cellular morphology  <cit>  and wall tensile strength  <cit> , have suggested developmental roles for extensin. however, it remained unclear whether the interaction of the network extensin with other matrix polymers exerts any direct and significant rheological effects in the cell wall. extensin can be secreted at an early stage in wall formation and there is evidence that it provides an essential scaffold for matrix assembly during wall regeneration in tobacco protoplasts  <cit> , or cell plate formation in arabidopsis  <cit> . additionally, the existence of chimeric, extensin-like members of the leucine-rich repeat family of receptor-like kinases, such as lrx <dig>  <cit> , suggests the means by which extensin network formation could provide molecular cues to regulate the down-stream synthesis and targeting of wall matrix materials. it could be argued, therefore, that the function of network extensin might be limited to providing essential structural, chemical and/or molecular cues for the later and correct incorporation of potentially more rheologically influential, nascent wall materials into the developing matrix.

here, we have examined the effects of extensin network formation within the primary wall matrix. the experimental system utilised therefore does not provide insight into extensin function during the earliest stages of wall formation. instead, it can be more easily related to that which occurs in the lateral walls of cells undergoing extension growth or growth cessation, or during the formation of cell-cell adhesions in intercellular corners where, in both cases, extensin is co-/secreted and later integrated as a network within an existing matrix of extracellular polymers.

the use of this approach allowed us to conclude that the formation of the extensin network in the grapevine callus primary cell wall can exert a direct and significant reduction in its hydration. as supported by em observations of concomitant changes in wall width, the resultant increase in wall density must occur with a significant decrease in polymer separation, with consequences to matrix pore size, polymer mobility and overall wall rigidity.

understanding the mechanistic basis of rapid, h2o2-induced reduction in wall hydration would be of considerable interest. the rod-like structure of typical dicotyledon extensins contains periodic, short stretches containing tyr residues involved in the formation of intra- and inter-extensin cross-links  <cit> . these latter are typically separated by 3- <dig> nm along the extended polypeptide , and therefore can potentially lead to the formation of a relatively dense protein network. the further oligomerisation of tyr to the trimer pulcherosine  <cit>  and tetrameric di-isodityrosine  <cit>  might permit a more extensive polymerisation of this network.

the reticulation of wall extensin requires tyr radical-radical condensation and therefore, a close interaction of extensin polypeptides. recent work with the amphiphilic arabidopsis extensin, atex <dig>  has shown this extensin can form rope-like and dendritic structures at interfaces through the lateral self-association of periodic hydrophilic and hydrophobic motifs  <cit> . evidence for lateral associations of tomato extensin was also described previously  <cit> . such associations could favour the juxtaposition of tyr residues from neighbouring extensin monomers and thus facilitate tyr oligomerisation and the intermolecular cross-linking of an essentially 2d network.

lateral association of atex3-like extensins might occur in vivo at lipid-water interfaces, such as at the phragmosome-cytosol interface during the early phase of cell plate formation. however, as shown in figure 7a-b, gvp <dig> is not directed to the cell plate, but is secreted into the matrix of lateral walls, where its electrostatic interaction with mobile and charged pectins would likely both dissociate and sterically hinder stable extensin-extensin assemblies. furthermore, the primary structure of gvp <dig> appears to lack the high periodicity of sequence repeats required for lateral associations of this type.

instead, the cross-linking of gvp <dig> could be facilitated by its loose ionic association and entanglement with the charged pectin network, whose high mobility  <cit>  and frequent, transient pore closures could promote extensin-extensin approximations for intermolecular bonding and the formation of an entangled 3d network within the wall matrix.

recently, we suggested that the formation of the extensin network could lock pectins into a more tightly packed configuration  <cit> . this is partially supported by the current data, which indicates that the formation of the gvp <dig> network can drive a reduction in inter-polymer spacing, with the concomitant extrusion of matrix water into the symplast and/or apoplastic space. several solid-state nmr studies have also shown that a reduction in wall hydration leaves the thermo-mobility of the relatively rigid cellulose-xyloglucan network largely unaffected, while pectic fractions become less mobile, leading to the production of a more compact wall structure  <cit> . it is therefore likely that the formation of network extensin primarily effects a reduction in pectin mobility and pore size, with consequences to overall matrix hydration, density and rigidity. however, it is clear that the matrix density in extensin network-containing walls is not 'locked', but remains sensitive to pectin charge, although significantly less so relative to control cell walls. this can be seen from their continued ability to demonstrate changes in hydration after the alteration of eibmp  or counterion levels .

a possible mechanistic explanation is that the gvp <dig> network contributes an additional, elastic component to the matrix, thus increasing its young's modulus and ability to oppose the osmotic pressure generated as a result of electrical disequilibrium between the matrix and external solute .

clearly, if the formation of the extensin network can drive decreases in matrix hydration as evidenced here, the network must be formed under strain. this is a conceivable result of forming a 3d network within a hydrated and mobile primary wall matrix, as described above. such a network could still partially accommodate charge-driven changes in matrix swelling by elastic deformation or relaxation.

characterising the non-extensin eibmps required in this process may also be of interest. however, we suggest that the extracellular proteins involved are likely to be the normal complement of ionically-bound proteins of diverse natures. many proteins, even those of acidic pi, contain patches of surface contiguous basic residues, which allows their binding to charged pectins  <cit> , thus reducing pectin charge and wall swelling  <cit> . consistent with a non-specific nature for these proteins, we find that the substitution of endogenous eibmps with a heat- and dtt-resistant fraction of endogenous grapevine eibmps, medicago leaf eibmps or poly-arginine were all effective in reducing hydration to control levels, and all could be used to closely mimic h2o <dig> effects on wall hydration when added to extensin network-containing walls .

recently, we reported that extensin network formation was a major contributory factor in wall resistance to digestion by fungal, lytic enzymes  <cit> . it seems likely that the effects of extensin network formation on matrix hydration and resistance to lytic enzymes are causally related, since reduced hydration could limit matrix pore size and thus restrict the mobility of lytic enzymes into the wall matrix  <cit> . however, the effect of extensin network formation on primary cell wall hydration is also likely to play an important role in dicotyledon development.

extensin is largely expressed in tissues containing primary cell walls  <cit>  and a few studies have indicated that this structural protein can be targeted to either lateral walls or cell-cell junctions  <cit> . this was confirmed in our study of jim <dig> signal distribution in selected tissues of grapevine, where this epitope can be located in the plane of the wall and/or within cell junctions. in all cases, the distribution of extensin strongly suggested its role in providing structural support to tissues, either by reinforcing cell walls or strengthening cell-cell adhesion. where extensin is present in cell walls, a h2o2- and extensin network-mediated reduction in matrix hydration could decrease polymer separation with an increase in pectin viscosity. this could provide increased resistance to shear stress between microfibril layers, thus imparting an increased cell wall rigidity and mechanical support to these tissues. similarly, the formation of the extensin network within intercellular junctions, which contain mainly pectin, could also decrease pectin pore size, with a consequent increase in viscosity to reinforce cell-cell adhesion strength.

interestingly, our data with primary cell walls indicates that extensin network formation increases matrix density, but also that these walls remain sensitive to changes in matrix charge. this could occur through changes in the interaction of proteins with the extracellular matrix or counter-ion concentration as shown here, but could also occur through developmentally regulated changes in the activities of e.g. plasma membrane proton pumps  <cit> , ion channels  <cit> , or pectin methyl esterases  <cit> . this suggests that extensin network formation may impart a more rigid structure to the plane of the wall or within intercellular junctions, without compromising the walls ability to undergo controlled swelling to facilitate the incorporation of additional wall material and matrix modifying enzymes required for further wall extension and development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have provided evidence that h2o <dig> can drive a rapid reduction in primary wall hydration and wall thickness in grapevine callus cells, and that extensin network formation was the major causal event in this process. these findings confirm an important role for the extensin network in the regulation of primary cell wall density, and demonstrate that extensin effects on wall hydration are sensitive to matrix charge. this report emphasises the importance of considering the effect of endogenous wall proteins on wall properties when extrapolating data from in vitro model studies to the interpretation of wall function and properties in vivo. the contribution of the extensin network in reducing primary wall hydration may be the principal means by which this structural protein effects changes in the biophysical properties of extracellular materials, with consequences to polymer separation, viscosity, wall rigidity, cellular adhesion and the regulation of extension growth.
