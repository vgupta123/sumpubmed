BACKGROUND
the ability to create good alignments is important when inferring knowledge from one sequence to another. alignments can be used in phylogeny to examine the evolution of sequences, and in protein structure prediction. in protein structure prediction, alignments are used to detect related sequences in a procedure called fold recognition, and to align the query sequence to related sequences.

in order to obtain good alignments, evolutionary information  should be used. it has also been shown that methods that use evolutionary information for both the query and target sequences are superior to methods that only use evolutionary information for either the query or the target sequence  <cit> . methods that use evolutionary information for both the query and target sequences are known as profile-profile methods. profile-profile methods have been observed to result in improved alignment quality compared to profile-sequence methods  <cit> . even though profile-profile methods improve the alignments it has been observed that they do not necessarily provide optimal alignments  <cit> .

to improve further both alignments and the detection of distantly related proteins, structural features of proteins are routinely used in the alignment procedure. structural features that have been used include secondary structure  <cit>  and solvent accessibility  <cit> . the secondary structure information has been incorporated into the score in different ways in different methods. in orfeus  <cit>  and prof_ss  <cit>  a score based on the predicted secondary structure is added to the profile-profile score of ffas  <cit>  and prof_sim  <cit> , respectively. wang & dunbrack constructed a secondary structure substitution table from predicted and observed secondary structures. the total score was calculated by adding the weighted ss_score to the weighted profile-profile score, where the sum of the two weights was set to one. however, this relationship between the profile-profile and the secondary structure score might not be optimal since only a modest improvement was seen in alignment quality. in contrast the addition of predicted secondary structure has been shown to improve the sensitivity of the detection of distantly related proteins significantly  <cit> . finally tang et al.'s hybrid sequence profile  <cit> , using secondary structure and structural information, seems to be a good example where in particular secondary structure information improves both the homology detection as well as the alignment quality.

although not completely uniform, a trend in studies to date suggest that predicted secondary structure improves alignments. it has also been shown that combining secondary structure predictions with other structural features can further improve the alignments  <cit> . this indicates that, if implemented correctly, different types of structural features can be included to improve alignment quality. we have recently developed a profile-profile scoring function, profnet  <cit> . in profnet the scoring function used in the subsequent alignment algorithm is trained to identify structurally superimposable residue pairs. profnet is based on an artificial neural network, which makes it easy to include additional information. therefore, we wanted to investigate how an alternative way of representing structural information would affect the alignment quality. the structural information used in this study is captured by a self-organizing map . we found that the alignment quality can be improved for distantly related proteins by combining a profile-profile score with a som based score. the effect is not as great as when predicted secondary structure is included, but by combining these with the som score we were able to improve the alignments further.

RESULTS
incorporating local structural information into alignment scores
it is well known that secondary structure information has the power of improving fold recognition and alignments, but it is still not known how best to include it into an alignment score. in this study we used predicted secondary structure from psi-pred  <cit>  for both the query and target sequences. first we constructed a normal profile-profile method using predicted secondary structures, which we refer to as prob_score_ss. here we use the same secondary structure scoring system as in orfeus. this secondary structure score, ss_score, is weighted and added to prob_score, which is our implementation of picasso <dig>  <cit> , one of the best methods in our benchmark study of profile-profile methods  <cit> . full details are provided in the methods section.

secondly, a new profnet version, profnet_ss, was constructed using the prob_score score, and predicted secondary structure as input. here, the ss_score was not calculated , instead the six psi-pred propensity values  were used directly as input to the artificial neural network. note that while the original profnet method takes two 20-dimensional profile vectors as input, we use the single prob_score value as input for the new versions developed here.

an alternative method to utilize local structural features is to cluster local similarities. such a clustering can be done using a self-organizing map which maps high dimensional data into a 2d or 3d grid. in this study, the similarities in profile vectors of a large set of proteins are clustered in such a way as corresponding to local structure states   <cit> . an advantage of this approach is that it is not necessary to use predefined secondary structure states, instead the som clustering defines the states. in figure 1a such a som mapping of a 15-residue sequence profile windows is shown. interestingly, multiple distinct regions of helix, strand and, to some extent, coil can clearly be seen. in figure 1b it can be seen that the soms also are able to capture some information about the solvent accessibility of the sequence windows, although this is less clear-cut . although they capture aspects of secondary structure, it should be noted that soms are not able to predict three-state secondary structure as well as ann based prediction methods, e.g. psi-pred . in our subsequent studies, windows of profile vectors were mapped onto 3d som grids.

preliminary studies suggested that the simultaneous use of som mappings based on different sequence window sizes produced slightly better results . in this study we have used three soms trained with sequence profile windows of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> residues. any given position in a sequence therefore maps to a 3d location in each of the three soms, making a total of  <dig> coordinates .

using this clustering technique we constructed two profnet versions, profnet_som, which uses prob_score's score and som locations, and profnet_ss_som which uses prob_score's score, predicted secondary structure and som locations as input, as depicted in figure  <dig>  for a summary of the inputs used in the different profnet methods, see table  <dig> 

for completeness, prob_score_som and prob_score_ss_som methods have also been implemented .

secondary structure information improves the alignments
the alignment quality performance was compared for protein pairs related at scop superfamily and fold level. the alignment quality of the prob_score_ss method, as measured by the average maxsub score, increased by 10% on superfamily level and by 40% on fold level  compared to prob_score, see table  <dig>  this is in line with earlier results on the combination of predicted secondary structure with profile-profile scoring. it should also be remembered that prob_score performs better than methods not using profile-profile scoring  <cit> , i.e. the baseline for improvement is quite high.

profnet_ss was shown to produce alignments of similar quality as prob_score_ss, with an improvement of  <dig> and 26% on superfamily and fold level  compared to profnet. hence, a significant improvement in alignment quality could be seen on fold level by adding predicted secondary structure to prob_score as well as to profnet, although the use of neural networks in this case is not particularly advantageous. these results show that predicted secondary structure is useful when aligning distantly related proteins, as observed in earlier studies  <cit> .

combined secondary structure information and som locations further improve the alignments
by combining plain som locations with prob_score score in profnet  the alignments show a slight improvement by  <dig> and 8% on superfamily and fold level respectively compared to profnet. this improvement is not very impressive, however by combining predicted secondary structure information and som locations the improvement on fold level is 49% compared to profnet and 18% compared to profnet_ss .  this indicates that the som based classification and the psi-pred secondary structure predictions contain complementary information. although the improvement of 18% might seem large it should be noted that this improvement is only seen at the fold level and the real increase in maxsub score is small . although we have optimized the parameters individually for each of the methods it was noted that the results were not extremely sensitive to this optimisation. using  <dig> of the best parameter sets profnet_ss obtained an average maxsub score of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and profnet_ss_som  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . this indicates that although the optimal parameter tuning improves the alignment quality by 10–20% the improvement from using the soms is consistent over a large set of parameters. figure  <dig> shows an example where the addition of som information improves the protein model by aligning the helices more correctly.

why does the som information improve the alignments?
from the results in table  <dig> we see that the alignments are improved most when a combination of profile-profile score, predicted secondary structure and som locations is used , while profnet_som actually performs slightly worse than profnet_ss. to gain a deeper understanding into what the som locations capture we have analysed pairs of structurally aligned residues in terms of the "som distance" , structural distance , prob_score and secondary structure identity. the som distance is calculated as the euclidean distance between the two points in the som cube to which a residue pair maps. more precisely it is the mean intra-som distance over the three soms which use different sequence profile window sizes. in figure  <dig> it can be seen that residues pairs having similar som values  are, on average, closer to each other in the structural superposition, that a higher fraction of these share the same secondary structure and that their sequence profiles are more similar. however, the average difference in solvent accessibility does not show a strong correlation to this measure. this indicates that the soms capture some information that might correspond to sequence/structure information that is not captured by secondary structure prediction or the profile-profile score. it might be speculated that the som clusters correspond to more fine grained features than the three-state model  used in secondary structure predictions or to the existence of larger fragment with significant sequence structure correlation as used in a recent study to improve alignment qualities  <cit> . alternatively subtle sequence signals that are not seen when adding the profile-profile scores might be captured as well.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we show that two different methods to combine predicted three-state secondary structure and profile-profile scores improve alignments for distantly related proteins. the two approaches are; addition of ss_score to prob_score and by using the predictions directly from psi-pred in profnet_ss. interestingly these two different approaches improve the alignments by a similar amount.

it was also found that predicted secondary structure combined with self-organizing maps  of sequence profile windows can be used to improve alignments of distantly related proteins  by a further small amount. the soms appear to be capturing information that is not directly related to solvent accessibility and is partially orthogonal to predicted secondary structure. the clusters on the som may correspond to fine-grained secondary and supersecondary structures which appear to be conserved at the fold level.
