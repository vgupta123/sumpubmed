BACKGROUND
the fundamental decision whether to become peripheral nervous system  or central nervous system  takes place in the dorsal domain of the developing neural tube . in this area three main populations of cells are sequentially generated. first to appear are various populations of neural crest  cells, consisting of precursors of most neurons and all glia of the pns as well as melanocytes, endocrine derivatives, etc. . second to appear are roof plate  cells, which constitute the definitive dorsal midline of the cns, and third are dorsal spinal interneurons, whose specification and differentiation are controlled by dorsal nt-derived signals .

only selected aspects of dorsal nt development have been experimentally addressed, and many essential questions remain unanswered. for instance, the mechanisms responsible for the ordered transition between nc and rp are largely unknown. although prospective premigratory nc and rp cells are not distinguishable at the early stages either morphologically or by molecular means, nc progenitors proliferate both before as well as after delamination, and in the trunk they synchronously exit the epithelium at the s phase of the cell cycle  <cit> . in contrast, rp cells become post-mitotic  <cit>  and adopt their characteristic morphology, constituting the definitive dorsal domain of the spinal cord.

single cell lineage tracing suggested that nc and nt progenitors derive from a common founder cell  <cit> . nonetheless, these studies did not identify the precise cns cell types involved , neither did they determine the exact stage in which this putative common founder cell prevails or segregates. hence, questions remain, such as where in the dorsal nt do rp cells originate and when precisely do they segregate from the nc lineage? using spatiotemporally controlled lineage analysis, our previous findings revealed that the dorsal nt is sequentially transited by distinct cell populations that exit the nt to populate nc derivatives  <cit> . in one of these studies it was found that rp progenitors originate ventral to the premigratory nc and relocate ventro-dorsally to reach their final position in the dorsal midline of the nt upon completion of nc exit  <cit> . furthermore, tracing the dynamics of the nc marker foxd <dig> using a specific reporter revealed that nc and rp progenitors are initially part of the foxd <dig> lineage, yet rp precursors downregulate its expression while relocating into the dorsal midline; this occurs when some nc progenitors still reside within the neuroepithelium  <cit> . hence, it is most likely that rp precursors share a common lineage with nc only at an early stage of dorsal nt development. this domain is, therefore, a dynamic area in which progressive nc emigration takes place until replacement by the definitive rp, thus resulting in the separation between cns and pns  <cit> .

the signaling activity of bone morphogenetic proteins  is essential for nc induction, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions , and specification and patterning of dorsal interneurons . but whether bmp signaling is necessary for rp development and what distinguishes between rp and nc in terms of bmp activity remains to be addressed. the transcription factors lmx1a and 1b are highly expressed in the dorsal nt and differentiated rp cells in the chick developing spinal cord. they were reported to act downstream to bmp and to affect expression of rp markers and interneuron development  <cit> . however, given that lmx genes in turn stimulate expression of both bmp and wnt  <cit> , the possibility exists that bmp acts on rp and/or interneuron production independently of lmx or that additional downstream factors are necessary.

in the present study, we characterize the nascent rp as an epithelial group of cells exhibiting apico-basal polarity and apically localized cilia, little or no cell proliferation, expression and activity of the basic helix-loop-helix  transcriptional repressor hes1/hairy <dig>  <cit> , and transcription of the ciliary protein foxj <dig>  <cit> . this contrasts with the proliferative nc stage in which dorsal nt cells are devoid of, or discontinuously express, n-cadherin and laminin while transcribing typical nc markers such as foxd <dig>  snail <dig>  and sox <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, we show that despite the constant production of bmp <dig> in the dorsal nt, rp progenitors only initially respond to the ligand and lose competence during their ventro-dorsal relocation towards the midline of the nt, with a concomitant downregulation of bmpr1a/alk <dig>  because both nc and rp progenitors are localized within a domain of high bmp activity  <cit> , we hypothesized that rp progenitors are also sensitive to bmp signaling. indeed, constitutive activation of the bmp pathway resulted in premature transcription of the rp marker hairy <dig>  notably, this was associated with an inhibition of nc production. furthermore, early misexpression of hes1/hairy <dig> at the nc stage inhibited bmp signaling while downregulating expression of the alk <dig> receptor, transcription of bmp targets such as foxd <dig>  cell-cycle progression, and nc emigration. conversely, foxd <dig> inhibited hairy <dig> altogether, suggesting that repressive cross-interactions at the level of and downstream of bmp ensure the temporal separation between the two lineages.

RESULTS
cellular characterization of the dorsal nt at nc and rp stages
to begin understanding the mechanisms underlying the transition from the nc to the rp stage, we first characterized differences in cellular behavior between the two phases. following electroporation of a gfp-encoding dna into the flank-level nt at embryonic day  <dig>  , we observed labeled nc derivatives in the periphery at e <dig>  . gfp+ cells were found in characteristic positions, such as the sympathetic ganglia, along nerves as schwann cells, in the dorsal root ganglion , and in the dermis corresponding to melanocytes . in contrast, electroporation of gfp at e <dig>   followed by fixation at e <dig>  did not produce any labeled cells outside the neuroepithelium , in agreement with our previous results  <cit> . this suggests that by e <dig>  at flank levels of the axis, all nc progenitors have already left the dorsal neuroepithelium, which is now occupied by definitive rp cells. hence, we refer to the period between e <dig> and e <dig>  in which the dorsal nt produces emigrating cells as the “nc stage” and to the period starting from e <dig>  onward as the “rp stage.”fig.  <dig> differential cellular characteristics of the neural tube at neural crest  and roof plate  stages. a, b transverse sections of the flank region of e <dig>  avian embryos whose hemi-neural tubes  were electroporated with a control gfp plasmid at e <dig>  or e <dig>  . note the contribution of labeled cells to nc derivatives including melanocytes  following early but not late stage electroporations. c, d bromodeoxyuridine  incorporation following a 1-h pulse at nc  or rp  stages. dashed lines in insets mark the dorsal nt domain that was quantified . note the presence of the brdu+ nuclei  in c–c” but not in the equivalent dashed area in d–d”. nuclei were visualized with hoechst. e–j antibody staining for epithelial  or ciliary  markers. arrows point to disorganized cilia , the absence of n-cadherin in the dorsal nt compared to more ventral regions , and an incomplete laminin-containing basal lamina  at the nc stage. in contrast, note the apically oriented cilia , positive n-cadherin immunostaining , and continuous laminin expression  in the dorsal nt at the rp stage . ect ectoderm. bar in a, b, d, h, j =  <dig> μm; c =  <dig> μm; c’, d’, e =  <dig> μm; f, g, i’ =  <dig> μm; e’ = <dig> μm; j =  <dig> μm; i = <dig> μm



we next characterized the dynamics of cell proliferation in the dorsal nt, because the transition from the g <dig> to the s phase of the cell cycle was found to be critical for nc delamination  <cit> . to this end, an area containing 8– <dig> nuclei per hemi-nt was considered in each section . these cells are included within the expression domain of foxd <dig> and mafb at the nc and rp stages, respectively. at the nc stage,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the cells in the dorsal nt had incorporated brdu following a 1-h pulse, consistent with previous findings  <cit> . at more advanced stages of nc delamination, the proportion of brdu+ nuclei decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, and by e <dig>  only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the nuclei were brdu+ . thus, the shift from the nc stage to the rp stage involves cell-cycle exit  <cit> , which is associated with the end of nc emigration.

next, we examined the expression of several proteins that characterize embryonic epithelia. at the nc stage, the apical epithelial markers zo- <dig> and n-cadherin were discontinuous or virtually absent in the dorsal nt, respectively   <cit> . in addition, arl13b-positive cilia  <cit>  were randomly distributed in the dorsal nt rather than pointing apically into the nt lumen as observed at more ventral regions of the neuroepithelium . furthermore, the laminin-expressing basement membrane at the basal side of the dorsal nt was discontinuous . in contrast, a close association between zo- <dig> and arl13b in the apical side of the nt was apparent at the rp stage , n-cadherin was re-expressed , and the laminin-positive basal lamina was uninterrupted . these observations suggest that the nascent rp regains epithelial characteristics such as apico-basal polarity, in spite of these being disrupted during the period of nc delamination.

shared and differential transcriptional gene patterns in the dorsal nt at nc and rp stages
to elucidate the mechanisms leading to the transition between nc and rp stages, it would be useful to identify and functionally characterize genes whose expression is restricted to either stage. to this end, we examined expression patterns of candidate dorsal nt markers.

the id family of transcriptional regulators encodes four hlh proteins that lack a basic dna-binding domain, and function in a dominant negative manner by binding and sequestering bhlh transcription factors into inactive heterodimers  <cit> . id <dig> was reported to regulate nc specification, and to maintain the balance between cell differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . ids are also known effectors of bmp signaling . id <dig> and id <dig> were expressed in the dorsal nt at the nc stage, but not in the definitive rp, and at the rp stage id2/ <dig> only appeared ventral to the rp, likely in dorsal interneuron progenitors . in contrast, no id <dig> or id <dig> were apparent in the dorsal nt . leukocyte tyrosine kinase  is expressed in zebrafish nc cells, and in particular in iridophores, where it was shown to be critical for their development  <cit> . ltk is also expressed in migrating avian cranial nc  <cit> . in the trunk, ltk was transcribed in the dorsal nt at the nc but not rp stage . additionally, transcription of foxd <dig>  sox <dig>  and snail <dig> was restricted to the neural progenitors of the nc and absent from the definitive rp .

the transcription factor foxj <dig> has been implicated in the formation of motile cilia. in the floor plate , foxj <dig> alters responsiveness of these ventral midline cells to sonic hedgehog , prompting them to become refractory  <cit> . evidence also points to its regulation by bmp signaling  <cit> . foxj <dig> mrna was only evident at the rp but not the nc stage, despite being transcribed continuously in the fp . hairy <dig>  a bhlh transcriptional repressor of the hairy/hes family, revealed a similar profile of expression to that of foxj <dig> . thus, while id1/ <dig>  ltk, foxd <dig>  snail <dig>  and sox <dig> are differential markers for the early nc stage, foxj <dig> and hairy <dig> differentially map to the rp stage. notably, bmp <dig>  gdf <dig>  wnt <dig>  mafb, and lmx1a/1b are continuously expressed throughout nt development, even if classically defined as rp markers . taken together, the above cellular and molecular traits differentially define two discrete phases in dorsal nt development: nc and rp.fig.  <dig> the roof plate  loses responsiveness to bmp signaling. a, c in situ hybridization for bmp <dig> at the neural crest  and rp stages. b, d antibody staining for psmad <dig> , <dig>  note positive signaling in the dorsal neural tube  at the nc stage . in contrast, the definitive rp  lacks a psmad signal yet the domain ventral to the yellow lines containing dorsal interneurons is positive. e, f dorsal views of whole mounted embryo fragments following dorsally directed electroporations  of bmp-responsive element -gfp along with control rfp to monitor electroporation efficiency. note positive and negative bmp reporter signaling at nc and rp stages, respectively. embryos were electroporated at either e <dig>  or e <dig>  and analyzed  <dig> h later. white dashed lines delineate the nt in b and d. c caudal, di dorsal interneurons, r rostral. bar in a =  <dig> μm; b, d =  <dig> μm; c =  <dig> μm



bmp signaling is transient in the dorsal midline of the nt
the definitive rp cells are refractory to bmp signaling
next, we began addressing the mechanisms responsible for the transition between these stages. during patterning of the nervous system, the dorsal nt produces and secretes proteins of the bmp family that at early stages control the emigration of nc  <cit>  and later induce, in a non-cell autonomous manner, the specification and differentiation of spinal interneurons  <cit> . these activities of bmp prompted us to examine its involvement in the transition between nc and rp stages during dorsal nt development.

in agreement with previous findings  <cit> , we observed that expression of bmp <dig> transcripts was evident in the dorsal nt at both nc and rp stages . bmp activity was evidenced with anti-phospho-smad 1-5- <dig>   <cit> . in contrast to bmp <dig> transcription, psmad staining was positive in the dorsal nt only at the nc stage . at the rp stage, only dorsal interneurons, located ventral to the definitive rp, were psmad+, while the midline rp domain was negative .

to further examine this stage-dependent difference in bmp sensitivity, we took advantage of a genetic reporter for bmp activity, consisting of a bmp responsive element  that drives expression of gfp  <cit> . focal electroporations of bre-gfp together with rfp to control for transfection efficiency were directed to the dorsal nt at e <dig>  or e <dig> . dorsal views of transfected neural primordia revealed many rfp+ cells at the nc stage exhibiting a bre:gfp signal , whereas only a few rfp+ cells approaching the rp stage were bre:gfp+  when examined  <dig> h after electroporation. hence, while both nc and rp cells produce and secrete bmp proteins, only progenitors at the nc stage are responsive. the definitive rp loses competence to respond to the bmp ligand, while continuing to provide bmp to the ventrally localized interneurons and/or their progenitors.

prospective rp cells are initially responsive to bmp
in a previous study  <cit>  we demonstrated that preceding the onset of nc delamination, rp progenitors cells are located ventral to the presumptive nc pool, and that they relocate dorsally upon nc emigration. in addition, we found that, initially, prospective rp progenitors are part of the foxd3+ lineage, but downregulate its expression during dorsal relocation  <cit> . we then hypothesized that rp progenitors are initially responsive to bmp signaling, given that all dorsal nt cells appear to be sensitive to bmp signaling at the nc stage . to test this notion, we transfected bre-gfp to the flank of  <dig> ss -stage embryos corresponding to the early nc stage. embryos were re-incubated for an additional  <dig> or  <dig> h until reaching the rp stage. as predicted, the midline rp domain was bre-gfp+ . because the rp is already insensitive to bmp by the time of fixation, , the gfp signal observed in the dorsal nt at e3–e <dig>  must result from an accumulation of the gfp protein following the early electroporation. because gfp has a half-life of about  <dig> h, it is possible to trace cells after the bmp signal has been turned off  <cit> .fig.  <dig> dynamics of bmp responsive element  in the dorsal neural tube . a–c hemi-nt electoporations of bre-gfp along with control rfp to trace electroporation efficiency. embryos were electroporated and analyzed at designated times. note presence of positive bre-gfp signal in rfp+ cells in the early electroporations . when electroporated later , the bre-gfp signal is absent in the definitive roof plate  but positive more ventrally. dashed lines in b and c delimit the definitive rp . d–d” in situ hybridization for foxd <dig> transcripts, showing co-localization with the bre-gfp signal in the dorsal nt. dashed lines mark the ventral limit of the foxd3-positive domain. note also the presence of foxd3+ neural crest cells migrating dorso-ventrally outside the neuroepithelium . in addition, the bre-gfp signal also extends further ventrally into a foxd3-negative region. bar for a–a” =  <dig> μm; b–d” =  <dig> μm



to control for this dynamic behavior, we performed similar electroporations a few hours later, in embryos aged 28– <dig> ss , still well within the nc stage  <cit> . under these conditions, the rp was largely negative for the bre-gfp signal . in this time frame, prospective rp cells are either unable to accumulate enough gfp before losing their capacity to respond to bmp, or they have already lost bmp sensitivity. these results reveal a similar temporal dynamic to that of rp progenitors, which only transiently exhibited foxd <dig> reporter activity  <cit> . for this reason, we analyzed embryos that were injected at an early stage with bre-gfp and then in situ hybridized for foxd <dig>  the foxd3+ signal was included within the dorsal domain of bre-gfp+ expression, encompassing at this stage both nc and rp precursors  <cit> . in addition, the bre-gfp signal extended further ventrally into a foxd3− region, likely comprising dorsal interneuron progenitors . together, these results suggest that prospective rp progenitors initially respond to bmp and then lose sensitivity upon relocation to their definitive dorsal midline position.

because bmp ligands are continuously produced by dorsal nt cells, we hypothesized that the development of rp insensitivity to bmp may be accounted for by a timely downregulation of bmp receptors. in situ hybridization revealed that while expression of bmpr1b  transcripts is apparent in the dorsal nt at both nc and rp stages, that of bmpr1a  is positive at the nc stage but downregulated at the rp stage . this indicates that the downregulation of specific bmp receptors is part of a mechanism responsible for the loss of competence of nascent rp cells to respond to bmp.

the dynamics of bmp signaling vis-à-vis rp progenitors
our results suggest that rp progenitors will respond to bmp signaling until they arrive at their dorsal midline position. notably, because of their initial ventral localization with respect to the nc and their prolonged ventro-dorsal relocation, rp progenitors are likely subjected to bmp for longer than the nc cells, which progressively exit the nt. it was previously suggested that extended exposure to morphogens such as bmp and shh is equivalent to generating a higher level of signaling required for the specification of distinct dorsal  <cit>  and ventral  <cit>  neuronal subsets, respectively. in such a case, exposing early neural progenitors to high bmp signaling should prematurely induce rp at the expense of nc. to test this possibility, a constitutively active  version of alk <dig> was used. in all cases , when electroporated into hemi-nts at 18– <dig> ss and fixed a day later, an ectopic psmad signal was detected in transfected cells. this contrasted with an observed psmad expression restricted to the dorsal domain under control conditions  .

next, we examined the effects of caalk <dig> on nc emt, g1/s transition, and gene expression. electroporations were directed ventro-dorsally, transfecting either the dorsal quadrant of hemi-nts or their dorsal domain on both sides of the midline. consistent with our hypothesis, nc emt was dramatically inhibited upon transfection of caalk <dig>  when compared to controls , as was the extent of brdu incorporation into the nuclei of transfected progenitors when challenged for a prolonged pulse of  <dig> h . in addition, by  <dig> h foxd <dig> mrna was downregulated in the caalk3-electroporated progenitors  compared to control gfp , confirming that nc production was inhibited. reciprocally, expression of the rp marker hairy <dig>  was upregulated as early as  <dig> h post-transfection to levels similar to those apparent in the fp  whereas control gfp had no effect .fig.  <dig> early exposure to constitutively active alk <dig> inhibits neural crest  traits and stimulates premature transcription of hairy <dig>  a, b transverse sections of control gfp  showing labeled cells that colonized the dorsal root ganglion  primordium as well as ectoderm . in contrast, no significant nc cell emigration is evident in caalk3-gfp transfected neural tubes  . the nc marker hnk <dig> is in red. c, d transverse sections following an extended 2-h pulse with brdu. embryos were sacrificed  <dig> h after a dorsally directed electroporation of either control gfp  or caalk <dig> . arrowheads point to gfp+/brdu+ cells. arrows point to gfp+/brdu− cells. e quantification of the mean percentages ± standard error of the mean of brdu+/gfp+ cells of total gfp+ cells in the dorsal nt . f–i’ caalk <dig> downregulates foxd <dig> mrna  and prematurely upregulates hairy <dig> to a level similar to that apparent in the floor plate  when compared to the corresponding contralateral sides or to control gfp-electroporated nts that show a similar level of bilateral transcript expression . bar for a, b =  <dig> μm; c, d =  <dig> μm; c’, c”

whereas nc proliferation and foxd <dig> expression are inhibited by high bmp signaling, our previous results showed that inhibiting endogenous bmp activity by noggin at the early nc stage also attenuates nc proliferation, foxd <dig> expression, and nc emt  <cit> . here, we further confirm and extend these data by showing that treatment with noggin, smad <dig> , or a dominant negative form of bmp receptor   <cit>  all caused a significant reduction of brdu incorporation in premigratory nc cells  <dig> h after electroporation when compared to control gfp-treated embryos . hence, both early inhibition as and high levels of bmp signaling compromise nc production. however, abrogation of endogenous bmp signaling did not promote a premature upregulation of hairy <dig> expression , in contrast to the premature appearance of hairy <dig> transcripts observed upon caalk <dig> treatment. in addition, no hairy <dig> mrna was apparent at the rp stage in embryos treated with either dnbmpr or noggin when compared to controls . together, these results suggest that bmp signaling is both necessary as well as sufficient for expression of hairy <dig> in rp and further indicate that development of rp properties requires high bmp signaling.

dynamics and function of hes/hairy <dig> in the dorsal nt
hes1/hairy <dig> activity is restricted to the rp stage
hes1/hairy <dig> is a candidate gene possibly involved in the transition between nc and rp stages because it is prematurely transcribed upon exposure of dorsal nt cells to high bmp signaling levels . furthermore, hairy <dig> mrna is expressed at the rp but not the nc stage . to further evaluate its involvement in this transition, we implemented the mouse hes <dig> promoter, homologous to chick hairy <dig>  <cit> , that drives expression of a reporter gfp cassette  <cit> . co-electroporation of the hes1/gfp promoter and control rfp at the nc stage  showed no gfp signal in the rfp+ progenitors when examined  <dig> h later . in contrast, the rfp+ rp cells were gfp+ when co-electroporation was performed at  <dig> ss . thus, consistent with its mrna expression pattern, hes <dig> is specifically active in the rp.fig.  <dig> misexpression of hes <dig> at the neural crest  stage inhibits g1/s transition and nc emigration. a–b’ co-electroporation of the dorsal neural tube  at the nc  or rp  stages, respectively, with control rfp  and a hes <dig> reporter-gfp. ten hours later, hes activity is apparent in rfp+ cells only at the roof plate  stage . c–j hemi-nt electroporations of control gfp or hes <dig> at the nc stage, analyzed  <dig> h ,  <dig> h , or  <dig> h  after transfection. dorsal views of whole embryos  and sections stained for the migrating nc marker hnk- <dig>  showing the absence of migrating hes1+ cells in d, f, and h compared to gfp+ controls in c, e, and g. i, j a brdu incorporation assay  showing reduced incorporation in the dorsal nt of embryos electroporated with hes <dig> compared to gfp controls. nuclei are visualized with hoechst . dashed lines delimit the analyzed dorsal nt domain. k quantification of the mean percentages ± standard error of the mean of brdu+ cells in the dorsal nt . bar in b, e, f =  <dig> μm; g, h = <dig> μm; a, i–j” =  <dig> μm



hes1/hairy <dig> inhibits nc delamination and cell-cycle progression
next, we examined whether misexpression of hes/hairy <dig> at the nc stage may adversely affect nc behavior. we observed no delamination either  <dig> or  <dig> days after electroporation of hes <dig>  the mouse hairy <dig> homologue , when compared to control gfp-electroporated embryos . next, we found that hes <dig> misexpression promotes premature cell-cycle exit in the electroporated cells, evidenced by the inhibition of brdu incorporation when compared to gfp controls .

hes1/hairy <dig> attenuates bmp responsiveness in the dorsal nt and downregulates alk <dig> mrna expression
the preceding results indicate that hes <dig> plays a role in ending nc production. this could be accounted for by hes <dig> exerting a negative feedback on bmp signaling or on genes acting downstream of bmp. such a hes1-dependent loss of endogenous bmp activity in dorsal nt cells might explain the loss of responsiveness to bmp observed upon transition into the rp stage, which causes a concomitant exit from the cell cycle and the end of nc emt.

to examine this possibility, hes <dig> was electroporated at the nc stage, and psmad expression analyzed  <dig> h later. in control gfp-transfected tubes, psmad staining was similarly expressed on both sides of the dorsal nt . in contrast, nts transfected with hes1/hairy <dig> displayed a significant reduction in psmad staining in the transfected hemi-nts .fig.  <dig> the relationship between hes1/hairy <dig>  bmp signaling, and downstream foxd <dig> expression. a–b” embryos were electroporated with either control gfp  or hes <dig>  at the neural crest  stage and analyzed  <dig> h later for psmad immunostaining . note the decreased psmad signal in the treated side at b’  compared to the untransfected side and to control gfp. c–d’ embryos were electroporated with either control gfp  or hes1/gfp  at the nc stage and analyzed  <dig> h later for alk <dig> mrna expression. note the reduction in the alk <dig> signal in the transfected  side of the hes-treated hemi-neural tube  . e–e” mutually exclusive spatial expression domains of foxd <dig> and hairy <dig>  in situ hybridization on adjacent sections of the same embryo performed at  <dig> ss. note that at this particular stage, hairy <dig> expression  is ventral to the foxd3+  domain. f, g’ foxd <dig> and hairy <dig> inhibit each other’s expression. electroporation of foxd <dig> at e <dig>  cell autonomously inhibits hairy <dig> expression in the dorsal nt  <dig> h later , compared to the contralateral side and to gfp-electroporated controls . h, h’ electroporation of hes <dig> at the nc stage inhibits foxd <dig> transcription compared to the contralateral side. arrowheads point to gfp+/foxd3− cells. for control see fig. 4f. bar for a–b”, f–g’ =  <dig> μm; c–e”, h, h’ =  <dig> μm



next, we asked whether the hes1-dependent loss of bmp activity can be explained by a downregulation of alk <dig> receptors, whose expression is normally lost in the transition between nc and rp stages . fifteen hours after the co-electroporation of hes <dig> and gfp-encoding plasmids at the nc stage, we observed a premature reduction of alk <dig> mrna signal in the transfected hemi-nts  when compared to control gfp alone .

thus, the onset of hairy <dig> production in the nascent rp might be sufficient to inhibit both bmp receptor expression and bmp responsiveness, consequently abrogating bmp-dependent g1-s transition and cell delamination.

a mutual cross-inhibition between foxd <dig> and hairy1
the transcription factor foxd <dig> is a bmp-dependent gene expressed from early stages onwards in the dorsal nt  <cit> . consistently, foxd <dig> is transcribed at the nc but not definitive rp stages   <cit> . conversely, expression of hes1/hairy <dig> is largely reciprocal to that of foxd <dig> . to further examine their differential expression, we performed in situ hybridization on embryos aged 33– <dig> ss , an intermediate stage corresponding to the dorsal restriction of the foxd3-positive domain  <cit>  and the onset of hairy <dig> transcription . in these embryos, foxd <dig> and hairy <dig> were not co-expressed in the same cells. whereas foxd <dig> mrna was already restricted to a narrow strip of progenitors located in the dorsal midline, hairy <dig> expression was apparent immediately ventral to the foxd3-positive domain, presumably corresponding to prospective rp progenitors . these results further strengthen the dynamic behavior of dorsal nt precursors where rp progenitors are situated ventral to the premigratory nc prior to arriving at their definitive position  <cit> .

based on their reciprocal expression patterns, we hypothesize that foxd <dig> and hes1/hairy <dig> may stand in a mutually repressive interaction. misexpression of foxd <dig> close to the end of the nc stage inhibited in a cell-autonomous manner the transcription of hairy <dig> when analyzed at the rp stage  in comparison to gfp controls . in addition, misexpression of hes <dig> at the nc stage repressed foxd <dig> mrna in the dorsal nt when compared to the untreated side and to control gfp .

these results suggest that foxd <dig> and hairy <dig> negatively regulate each other, thus maintaining both spatial and temporal separation between nc and rp properties in the dorsal neuroepithelium.

discussion
during the development of the cns, neuroepithelial cells gain distinct identities and give rise to numerous cell types. in the region of the nt destined to become the spinal cord, the acquisition of distinct fates is coordinated by the rp and fp, organizing centers secreting diffusible instructive signals. but how do the organizing centers themselves form and gain their proper fates? while significant work has been invested in understanding fp development  <cit> , very little is known about the formation of the rp. this is further complicated by the highly dynamic behavior of this region, which is first populated by nc progenitors and only after their exit from the nt becomes the rp, a definitive group of cns cells.

here, we have begun to unravel the mechanism that accounts for the transition between nc and rp stages. first, we have identified a number of cellular and molecular traits that characterize each stage. second, we report that although initially responsive to bmp, rp progenitors lose competence to respond to the ligand upon transition to their definitive location. in parallel, rp cells upregulate hairy <dig>  which is likely to confer the observed insensitivity to bmp signaling, despite the fact that they continuously synthesize the ligand. consequently, nc production and emigration end, presumably due to a cell-cycle arrest induced by hairy <dig> via downregulation of bmp receptors and consequent bmp signaling. in addition, foxd <dig> and hairy <dig> not only have non-overlapping temporal expression patterns, but also inhibit each other’s transcription. together, this constitutes a negative regulatory loop at the level of, and downstream from, bmp signaling that controls the sequential production of nc followed by rp .fig.  <dig> the dynamics of dorsal neural tube  development: transition from neural crest  to definitive roof plate . a before the onset of nc migration , presumptive rp progenitors  are located ventral to the premigratory nc . they progressively reposition dorsally upon the onset and progression of nc emigration  until reaching their definitive localization at the dorsal midline of the central nervous system primordium . arrows depict the ventral to dorsal direction of cellular relocation. for details see  <cit> . b, c at the early nc stage, bmp signaling becomes active in the dorsal nt , inducing a series of bmp-dependent genes such as foxd <dig>  and promoting cell-cycle progression and subsequent nc epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions  and delamination. as time goes on, nc cells leave the dorsal nt while rp progenitors are exposed to bmp signaling for a longer duration, perhaps interpreted as a higher signaling level . this induces initial hairy <dig> synthesis ventral to the progressively narrowing domain of foxd <dig> . at the rp stage, hairy1-expressing cells reach the dorsal midline domain and hairy <dig> inhibits expression of alk <dig> receptors and further responsiveness of rp cells to bmp signaling , which results in the inhibition of foxd <dig> transcription, arrest of cell-cycle progression, and the end of cellular emt, altogether contributing to the consolidation of the definitive rp. given that misexpression of foxd <dig> close to the rp stage inhibits hairy <dig>  these cross-repressive interactions may account for the spatial and temporal separation of nc and rp lineages. the arrow in c depicts a time sequence



classically, the term rp is generically used to define the dorsal domain of the nt, in particular with regard to its morphogen-secreting capacity and function in patterning of dorsal interneurons  <cit> . however, compounds that are usually considered as rp markers—such as morphogens like bmps and wnts, and transcription factors like mafb and lmx1a/b—are produced throughout dorsal nt development, encompassing the early nc period  <cit> . clearly, the dorsal nt differs significantly between the stages both in terms of cell fates and cellular behaviors, demonstrating the need for a more exact definition.

our previous experiments  <cit>  showed that progenitors of the definitive rp are initially located ventral to the prospective nc. initially, these cells are molecularly indistinguishable from presumptive nc because they also express foxd <dig>  as evidenced by the use of a foxd <dig> reporter  <cit> , and are still responsive to bmp, as revealed here by lineage analysis with a bre-gfp reporter. upon nc emigration, prospective rp cells relocate dorsally toward their definitive midline position, and during this time they become refractory to bmp, downregulate alk <dig>  and cease to express foxd <dig> and the direct bmp target genes id2/ <dig>  the initiation of hairy <dig> expression must be associated with these events, because it is initially evident in a band of cells localized ventrally to the foxd3+ domain; later, when bmp responsiveness and foxd <dig> transcription are lost, hairy <dig> expression and activity are evident in the most dorsal nt domain. this correlates in time with the completion of nc emigration.

this view would suggest that the functions of bmp and wnt signaling differ between the nc and rp stages. studies so far have addressed the role of these signaling molecules on various aspects of interneuron development yet misexpressed the ligands starting at the nc stages and analyzed the outcome  <dig> days later, thus encompassing both phases  <cit> . clearly, limiting the loss of either bmp or wnt function to the nc phase inhibits g1/s transition and the consequent emt of these precursors by activating a molecular network that includes n-cadherin processing and rho-gtpase activity  <cit> . however, it remains unclear whether such an early and time-limited inhibition suffices for preventing or altering interneuron development, and whether the latter cells require a continuous supply of the factors or, alternatively, whether a late supply by the definitive rp suffices given that interneuron progenitors still exhibit bmp responsiveness at this stage . another possibility would be that signals emanating from the young dorsal nt are important for interneuron specification and then differentiation  <cit> , whereas those from the definitive rp are necessary for axonal outgrowth and/or guidance. taken together, we sustain that the use of the term rp to describe the structure emerging upon nt closure is inappropriate and propose instead to use the term rp only when nc delamination has ended, and the full segregation between cns and pns lineages is evident.

members of the hes/hairy family of transcriptional repressors were found to be constitutively expressed in neural boundary domains, like the rp and fp of the spinal cord  <cit> . persistent and high hes <dig> expression levels repress both proneural gene transcription and cell proliferation in boundary regions within the nervous system  <cit> , whereas in the absence of hes, mash <dig> and other proneural genes are ectopically expressed in these domains  <cit> . in addition, an oscillatory expression of hes genes has been documented in developing neuroblasts. this oscillatory behavior was critical to maintain progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state while inhibiting neuronal differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, hes/hairy genes were found to play a role in regulating cell-cycle progression  <cit> . whereas low levels of hes <dig> promote cell proliferation by downregulating p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> , persistent and high levels of hes <dig> were shown to inhibit the cell cycle  <cit> . consistently, as shown here, the advent of the rp is associated with cell-cycle exit and the onset of hairy <dig> transcription. moreover, hes misexpression at the nc stage inhibited g1/s transition and nc production, suggesting that hairy <dig> is functionally involved in ending nc production and rp formation.

an open question is what are the mechanisms that trigger hes1/hairy <dig> expression at the rp stage. because both nc and rp precursors lie within a domain of high bmp signaling that expresses msx1/ <dig>  <cit> , we speculate that it is the comparably extended exposure of the latter to bmp that induces rp properties including hairy1; this might occur by translating the longer duration of signal into a higher level of activity  <cit>  as suggested by our caalk <dig> experiments. in addition, given that foxd <dig> represses transcription of hairy <dig>  and suppresses interneuron development  <cit> , it is logical to assume that hairy <dig> transcription can only be stabilized in rp cells when foxd <dig> itself is repressed or when foxd3+ nc progenitors exit the nt. our data moreover suggest that hairy <dig> itself contributes to the inhibition of foxd <dig> mrna, either directly or indirectly by abrogating the responsiveness of dorsal nt cells to bmp signaling, the latter being a positive regulator of foxd <dig> transcription  <cit> . indeed, high levels of bmp activity  might be sufficient for inducing hairy <dig> and repressing foxd <dig> transcription in the dorsal nt, thus generating a feedback network of transcriptional interactions that consolidate rp formation .

in addition to expressing hes/hairy, fp and rp share similar roles because these boundary domains act as organizing centers that secrete morphogens to pattern neuronal differentiation in adjacent cells. previously, high concentrations of the shh morphogen, which is secreted by the notochord, were shown to be needed in both mouse and avian embryos to specify the ventral midline domain as fp. later, to complete fp differentiation, these cells become refractory to the ligand  <cit> . in addition, foxj <dig> is upregulated in fp cells in association with the reduction in shh responsiveness, and foxj <dig> alters the sensitivity of cells to shh signaling, presumably by inducing long, motile cilia  <cit> . by analogy to the fp, we show here that upon nt closure and during the nc stage, dorsal progenitors respond to bmp, but while transiting to the dorsal midline they downregulate alk <dig> receptors, stop responding to bmp, and similarly upregulate foxj <dig>  regaining apically organized arl13b + cilia and apico-basal polarity. thus, in spite of the delayed development of the rp when compared to the fp  <cit> , there are notable similarities between the specification of both ventral and dorsal organizing centers. further investigation is needed to substantiate the mechanistic similarities between fp and rp development by examining, for instance, whether foxj <dig> in the rp similarly alters bmp responsiveness and cilia morphology and function.

CONCLUSIONS
by initially characterizing a set of positive and negative activities involving regulated bmp signaling and hes/foxd <dig> interactions, our results provide novel insights into the dynamic events leading to the transition from the nc to the rp phase of nt development. four main processes are noteworthy: first, our finding that rp progenitors initially respond to bmp yet lose competence upon relocation to their definitive dorsal midline position in the nt, where they finally consolidate their identity; second, that bmp signaling induces hes transcription, which in turn downregulates bmp responsiveness, likely through modulation of alk <dig> receptor transcription; third, that downstream of bmp, a cross-repressive interaction between foxd <dig>  and hairy <dig>  accounts for the temporal and spatial segregation of both lineages; and fourth, that in spite of being refractory, the definitive rp continues producing bmp, which is likely to act upon dorsal interneurons. the precise time-dependent activities of bmp emanating from the early  versus late  dorsal nt remain to be defined. these multiple roles of bmp signaling indicate that its function is context dependent and dictated by the regulatory state and competence of the target cells. we also notice that rp ontogeny bears significant resemblance to the development of the fp, initiated by shh signaling in the ventral nt, both in terms of signal duration/intensity followed by refractoriness. future research should focus on unveiling additional genes and interactions that comprise the differential molecular networks underlying the sequential functions of bmp on nc, rp, and interneuron development.
