BACKGROUND
dissection of genetic architecture of complex trait such as growth and yield in plants has been achieved by quantitative trait loci  detection approaches. dissecting loci to find the causative genes can be considered as the holy grail for geneticists. the ultimate road to find the genes, positional cloning, has been achieved in main crop plants
 <cit>  but it is slow and labour intensive especially because large segregating populations have to be developed. the advent of plant whole genome sequences has opened the possibility of anchoring genetic maps and positioning qtl on a physical map. nevertheless, qtl intervals correspond to several hundreds of genes
 <cit> . despite of some successful positional cloning stories in plants, there is room for complementary approaches, like association mapping  or integrative –omics strategies
 <cit> , proposed to narrow intervals and length of candidate gene lists to be studied further
 <cit> .

the identification of quantitative trait loci  has already been reported for poplar species including several yield and growth components such as stem dimension  and architecture
 <cit> . these studies together identified more than  <dig> qtls explaining up to 73% of the trait variation, with confidence intervals ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm. these global summary statistics confirm the common idea that growth traits in populus are controlled by many loci. however, ranges of variation explained and size of confidence intervals highly depend on the mapping population used and the environment in which traits are measured.

today, the anchoring of genetic maps and qtls on populus trichocarpa genome sequence
 <cit>  allows identifying large genome regions containing several hundred of genes. in order to reduce this number to a reasonable number of candidate genes, one strategy consists in selecting candidate genes based on functional knowledge  and check if the candidates co-locate with qtls
 <cit> . another strategy, applied in populus spp., consists in combining qtl position, structural information and transcriptomic experiments to refine a gene list for functional characterization
 <cit> . the present study focused on traits that are of notable importance for poplars biomass production systems, where juvenile growth, architecture and water use efficiency  are the main criteria for breeding programs. among published qtl studies carried out on these traits, few have anchored qtls on the poplar genome to identify and analyse the underlying large candidate gene lists
 <cit> . today, the biological interpretation of these gene lists is made possible by the availability of biological knowledge accumulated in public databases  and bioinformatic high-throughput enrichment tools
 <cit> . in this study, ontologizer
 <cit>  was used in order to analyse gene sets included in qtl confidence intervals and we tested if qtl regions are statistically enriched in some functional categories compared to the entire genome.

the objectives of this study were:  to identify qtls controlling productivity, architecture and leaf traits in hybrid poplars;  to identify candidate genes under qtl intervals using enrichment tools and gene ontology.

RESULTS
trait variation, distribution and relationship between traits
frequency distributions were not significantly departed from normal distribution . genotype effect was significant for all traits . the p. deltoides parent showed higher overall growth in height and circumference than the p. trichocarpa parent . the progeny showed generally a higher growth than both parents. a proportion of transgressive segregation  was calculated and it was high for all traits related to growth which was not the case for leaf traits. the coefficients of genetic variation  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. values of heritability at genotype level were moderate to high  and h2individual was low to moderate, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

a based on two ramets only.

b individual  and genotypic  heritabilities.

c the minimum and the maximum of genotypic means.

all leaf traits were significantly correlated, either negatively or positively and the highest correlation coefficients were observed between sla and Δ , and between sla and nm . all productivity traits were significantly correlated except syllep <dig> with deltah. the strongest correlations were observed between height and circumference within and between years, and between annual growth  and the second year measurements . carbon isotope discrimination is negatively correlated with all productivity traits. number of sylleptic branches was correlated more tightly with circumference than with height. correlations between leaf and productivity traits of the first year were higher than with second year productivity traits.

genetic maps and qtl analysis
among the  <dig> new ssr tested, only  <dig> were distorted and, as they were not linked between them, they were discarded for the linkage analysis. genetic maps used for the detection of qtls and their projection on the genome are summarized in additional file
 <dig>  briefly, genetic maps cover  <dig>  <dig> cm and  <dig>  <dig> cm for the p. deltoides and p. trichocarpa maps respectively, with a mean distance between markers of  <dig>  cm. the mean numbers of marker per linkage groups were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for p. deltoides and p. trichocarpa respectively. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> markers anchored to the genome sequence for p. deltoides and p. trichocarpa respectively. a mean of  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers were anchored per linkage groups. all of them, with the exception of  <dig> linkage groups of the p. trichocarpa genetic map, were assigned to a chromosome . estimated genome coverage was 78% and 66% for p. deltoides and p. trichocarpa map respectively.

the results of qtl detection are listed in additional file
 <dig> and details on genetic maps and qtl positions are graphically presented in figure
 <dig>  a total of  <dig> qtl were detected explaining between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the trait variation . the maximum was reached for nm on linkage group ii on the p. deltoides map. an average of  <dig>  and  <dig>  qtls were detected per trait respectively on the p. deltoides and p. trichocarpa maps, and total explained variance varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, maximum being reached by nm. thirty five qtls were detected on the p. deltoides map and  <dig> on the p. trichocarpa map.

all qtls were not distributed evenly on the genome , and one linkage group  came out to be a hot spot with  <dig> qtls. among the  <dig> qtls controlling height and circumference measured the first and the second year, only few cases of co-location were identified .

qtl projection on the genome
among the  <dig> markers having sequence information , only  <dig> did not show matching or showed inconsistent matching on the genome sequence . genetic and physical positions for  <dig> markers were used to calculate and compare within chromosome pair wise genetic and physical distances . the global ratio between physical distance  and genetic distance  was  <dig>  bp/cm for the p. deltoides map and  <dig>  bp/cm for the p. trichocarpa map. this ratio varied between linkage groups, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp/cm for the p. deltoides linkage groups, and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for the p. trichocarpa linkage groups.

among the  <dig> detected qtls, only  <dig> could not be projected on the genome . for  <dig> qtls, the corresponding lg carried only one marker that could be anchored on the genome and this configuration did not allow to correctly orientate the qtl on the genome. for one qtl , there was no anchoring marker. mean size of projected qtl interval was  <dig> , <dig> bp for p. deltoides and  <dig> , <dig> bp for p. trichocarpa. mean number of genes included in all qtls confidence intervals for a particular trait was  <dig>  and varied between  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

a size of the total population is  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  have at least one correspondence with a go term.

b the mean is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

c topology-weighted analysis and p-value <  <dig> %.

d the mean is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

go terms enrichment in qtl confidence intervals
projecting the qtls into physical genomic regions provided the opportunity to search for possible enrichment in gene functions that could be related to the traits under study. a rational and without a priori strategy to do this is to analyse the gene ontology  annotation associated with the gene sets. the available gene ontology  annotation was relatively limited for populus trichocarpa as compared to the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. indeed, searching for go association in phytozome plant genome database,  <dig>  gene models have been found associated with at least one go term . in order to increase the number of annotated gene models, a populus go annotation has been inferred based on protein-protein similarity between arabidopsis and poplar. at least one go term annotation could be retrieved for  <dig>  genes among the  <dig>  poplar gene models identified in phytozome, which represent  <dig> % of genes annotated . main results obtained from the gene ontology analysis are presented in table
 <dig>  for each qtl intervals, the percentage of annotated genes did not differ significantly from the  <dig> % determined above. consequently, enrichment analysis was not biased by a distortion in the percentage of annotated genes within the qtls. at a p-value threshold of 1%, the number of over-represented go terms varied between  <dig> and  <dig> depending on the considered trait. the percentage of significantly over-represented  go terms on total number of go terms for a particular trait varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. there was no significant correlation between the cumulated size of qtl confidence intervals on the genome for a particular trait and the number of significant go terms in the corresponding intervals . remarkably, a significant higher percentage of over-represented go terms was observed for the gene set included in confidence intervals of all qtls controlling the number of sylleptic branches . interestingly, this trait showed the highest heritability  and coefficient of genetic variation . thus, we decided to explore further gene ontology enrichment within qtls controlling number of sylleptic branches . complete lists of go terms significantly enriched are presented in additional file
 <dig> 

functional analysis of genes in qtl confidence intervals controlling number of sylleptic branches
an additional enrichment method called mgsa for model-gene based analysis, developed recently and integrated to the ontologizer webtool, has been tested. this method is presented as faster and more accurate in identifying less redundant go terms than previous methods such as the topology-weighted methods
 <cit> . figure
3a presents a detailed view of the enrichment analysis using the topology-weighted  method. only one run is needed with this method that provides a p-value associated with each go term. as already mentioned earlier by
 <cit> , the tw method may give some redundant results as observed for example in lines  <dig> to  <dig> for the go term related to dna binding. results were not so redundant with mgsa . however, the main disadvantage of mgsa is the lack of consistency between replicated analyses. this could be due to the bayesian approach and must be taken in consideration. several runs of mgsa were performed in order to be able to have a ranking of the most pertinent go terms and to compare this ranking between tw and mgsa . significant variability between the  <dig> runs of mgsa was observed leading to the conclusion that the mgsa method did not gave reliable results. however, when comparing the first  <dig> terms identified using both enrichment methods, common go term were found corresponding to the biological processes of adventitious root development . the second most significant go term referred to the process of shade avoidance, which could make sense regarding branch formation. if the  <dig> dna binding and transcription factors terms identified were removed considering them as generic and thus not so biologically informative, the third enrichment class corresponded to genes potentially involved in the ripening process, an important process in fruit development but somewhat intriguing in shoot development. these three sets were analysed further.

a the column ‘p-value’ indicates 1) for mgsa: the marginal value of a term being in the ‘active’ state; thus a high value gives a strong evidence for an association; the mean marginal value from  <dig> runs is indicated ; 2) for tw: the probability of observing at least the same amount of enrichment when significant genes are randomly selected out of all genes; thus, a very small value gives strong evidence for an association.

b the counts of genes in the study  and population  sets as x / y.

c p, f, c refer to the three classes of the gene ontology: biological process, molecular function and cellular component respectively.

topology-weighted  and model-based gene set analysis  results are shown.

eight genes corresponding to adventitious root development were found: poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig>  poptr_0002s <dig> . all these genes belonged to the chromosome  <dig>  in the text below, all gene names refer to arabidopsis naming nomenclature. annotation was analysed looking to the peptide homologs on phytozome . seven genes encode cytochrome p <dig>  family  <dig>  subfamily b and their protein homologs in arabidopsis correspond to cyp83b <dig> / sur <dig>  the percentage of similarity at the amino acid level was between 60% and 65%. the last gene, poptr_0002s <dig>  encodes an arf <dig> homolog. these  <dig> genes were also gathered under the enriched go term related to shade avoidance identified as the second most significant term. in addition, two other genes were within this group: poptr_0002s <dig> and poptr_0005s <dig>  they were localized on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> and they encode par <dig>  homologs.

the third selected enrichment gathered five genes related to the biological process of ripening as inferred from ontology annotation in arabidopsis . the official go annotation of the two arabidopsis homologous transcripts identified here  was inferred from sequence similarity with a ripening regulated protein ddtfr <dig> identified in solanum lycopersicum . the five poplar homologues genes originated from three different chromosomes. they encoded proteins belonging to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion  protein family, included in the large superfamily of multidrug transporters
 <cit> .

discussion
are trait variation and correlations among traits consistent with previous studies?
the baseline for all genetic improvement is the availability of information on genetic variation for the traits of interest. efforts have been made to describe growth and wue variations and relationships among traits in different unrelated poplar cultivars and hybrid families under different water regimes
 <cit> . high levels of genotypic variability for productivity and for Δ have been found under non limited water supply or moderate water deficit. in the present study, progeny mean values for stem height at the end of the first and second growing seasons were in agreement with those previously reported for other p. deltoides x p. trichocarpa f <dig> large family on the same trial
 <cit> . nevertheless, the range of values was lower. in a subset of  <dig> genotypes of the same family measured in an adjacent trial
 <cit> , height and circumference means were not comparable because of the trial management , but for leaf traits, mean values were similar, showing that the trial management did not influenced leaf trait variability. on the contrary, for a different p. deltoides x p. trichocarpa f1
 <cit>  measured on the same trial, parental and progeny means for leaf traits , were higher than those reported in the present study.

a proportion of transgressive segregation was calculated to make comparisons with previous studies where it was considered as heterosis
 <cit> . this proportion was lower for circum <dig>  deltac and deltah. these differences could be explained by a difference in circumference for the p. trichocarpa parent. the p. trichocarpa 101– <dig> parent of the present study had a lower juvenile growth than the p. trichocarpa ‘v24’ parent from
 <cit> . for populus spp., parental specific effect can explain a significant part of the trait variation in progenies . for leaf traits, low or no significant levels of transgressive segregation were observed as previously reported
 <cit> .

analysis of the relationship among traits measured the first year shows that productive clones  were characterized by low sla  and low carbon isotope discrimination . water use efficient clones  were characterized by low sla  and low leaf nitrogen content. very low or no correlation was observed between leaf nitrogen content and growth traits, which is contradictory with previous studies on the subset of the same progeny or other progeny
 <cit> . the strength of the links between productivity and Δ differ according to poplar species: a positive relationship was found for populus davidiana <cit> , whereas negative correlations were detected for p. trichocarpa × p. deltoides and no correlation was observed in p. deltoides × p. nigra <cit> . occurrence of genetic variability and no systematic trade-off between these traits suggest that it should be possible to select genotypes combining large levels of productivity and wue. the different trial managements and genetic or species backgrounds could explain these discrepancies.

could qtls be identified for growth and leaf traits?
given the range of variation, the significant genotype effect and levels of heritability for all traits measured, significant results from the qtl detection were expected. average qtl number for each trait was very similar to those reported previously
 <cit>  but less than average qtl number reported elsewhere
 <cit> . this could be explained by a larger trait variation existing in a f <dig> progeny in the latter studies. a hot spot of qtl co-location on lg v was related to growth traits and sla. these results were in agreement with the negative correlation observed between both types of traits. additionally, the opposite effects of qtls for both types of traits were also in agreement with the sign of trait correlation . this linkage group in this particular pedigree was also involved in bud phenology . growing season length explained a large part of productivity in poplar
 <cit>  and could explain the colocation of growth and budset qtls. on the other hand, for highly correlated traits, like circumference and height measured in the first and second growing seasons, the observed number of co-locations was lower than expected. this could be partly explained by the cut off  for declaring a qtl, which eliminate qtls that were just below the threshold . additionally, the high correlation might be driven by plant intrinsic mechanistic correlations between traits.

all qtls controlling Δ were on the p. trichocarpa parental map. despite of a significant negative correlation between circumference measured the first year  and carbon isotope discrimination , no qtls co-location  has been detected for these two traits. the map coverage was not exhaustive and could explain the absence of co-location. nevertheless, availability of unlinked qtls for different trait of interest has a particular advantage for breeding purposes: it opens here the possibility to select clones combining both high productivity and high water efficiency.

for comparison with published qtls in other mapping pedigrees, we focused on studies with the same populus species and with genetic maps carrying a significant number of genome anchoring markers
 <cit> . in many cases, co-locations occurred on the same chromosomes only when pairs of studies were compared . in only one case , a co-location occurred in the four studies compared . there were very few common anchoring markers between all genetic maps, which impeded a meta-analysis of qtls, but anchoring on genome allowed aligning all the maps. the genome interval to consider included actually almost the whole chromosome, and need to be narrowed for further analysis and interpretation.

could candidate genes for leaf and growth traits be identified through go term enrichment analysis within qtl confidence intervals?
it was the first time go term enrichment analysis is used in plants to identify putative candidate genes for qtls. generally, a priori identified candidate genes were searched within qtl intervals: their presence therefore “validate” putative important gene function related to the trait . however, a recent analysis in animals provided evidence of over represented go terms in qtl regions of the bovine genome
 <cit> . moreover, the authors showed that enrichment classifications are consistent with the trait category controlled by the qtls. in the present study, for all traits, significant go terms enrichment were found in qtl confidence intervals. for qtls controlling sylleptic branches,  <dig> genes linked to the go:  <dig> defining the biological process of adventitious root formation were found. these genes not only belong to the chromosome  <dig> but they are also clustered together on the chromosome. so they may have been identified by the enrichment methods because they are duplicated in tandem and not because they could be involved in the trait variation. this remark is also true for all associations found. however, the significant association due to a physical linkage between genes seems less plausible when the significant go terms are associated with genes from different chromosomes. five genes identified correspond to the enrichment in go term related to ripening. these  <dig> genes are located on  <dig> different chromosomes. in that case, the association due to tandem duplication biases of this enrichment seems unlikely.

what is the meaning of finding enrichment in biological processes such as adventitious root formation and ripening when studying sylleptic branches formation?
in perennial dicotyledonous species such as poplar, sylleptic branches are formed either on the elongating stem during the growing season or at the time of regrowth, from arrested axillary buds formed the year before. in the present study, the number of sylleptic branches was measured at the end of the first growing season and do not proceed from axillary bud break. therefore, sylleptic branches formation measured here might have some common features with the mechanism of shoot branching well studied in model plant such as arabidopsis. the two class of genes related to adventitious root formation were sur <dig> and arf <dig> homologs. these go classification make sense because sur <dig> defines the first step in making indolic glucosinolates from indole-3-acetaldoxime . loss-of-function sur <dig> mutants block the production of glucosinolates from iaox, leading to an increased iaox flux for iaa biosynthesis. in that way, sur <dig> participates in auxin homeostasis
 <cit> . likewise, arf <dig>  belongs to the auxin response factor  gene family products which together with the auxin / indole-3-acetic acid  proteins regulate auxin-mediated transcriptional activation / repression
 <cit> . arf <dig> was predicted to control adventitious rooting by modulating indole-3-acetic acid  homoeostasis
 <cit> . several hormones such as auxin, cytokinin, and the newly identified strigolactones are known to act directly or indirectly on bud outgrowth and to control shoot branching
 <cit> . consequently, the identified poplar genes could be related to auxin homeostasis regulation in shoot branching rather than adventitious root formation; and this makes sense with respect to the trait under study. these  <dig> genes were also gathered under the enriched go term related to shade avoidance identified using the topology-weighted . in addition, two other genes are within this group: poptr_0002s <dig> and poptr_0005s <dig>  they are localized on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> and they encode par <dig>  homologs. par <dig> functions as transcriptional repressor of auxin-responsive genes saur <dig>  and saur <dig> . it is obvious that the similarity was very low and thus the function largely undetermined. however, their co-localization with the sur <dig> and arf <dig> homologs was an argument to explore further their function in auxin response signalling in poplar.

are the mate-type transporters involved in auxin/strigolactones signalling?
the second most significant enrichment gathered five genes related to a go term defining ‘ripening’. these five genes encode putative mate efflux family proteins. mate proteins are believed to function as proton-dependent efflux transporters. these classes of proteins were identified through their trans-membrane protein domain and were grouped in pfam database
 <cit>  under the pfam family accession pf <dig>  in phytozome database,  <dig> poplar proteins carrying this protein domain were found. similarly,  <dig> putative mate proteins in arabidopsis were identified. this is consistent with previous studies indicating that mate proteins have exceedingly large numbers of homologs in plants per species, in that aspect contrasting to what is observed in bacteria and animals
 <cit> . but little is known about their function in plants. one can hypothesize that the genes identified here could have a function in shoot branching through hormones regulation. in mammals, mate-type transporters recognize hydrophobic hormones and transmitters, such as testosterone and corticosterone
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, tt <dig> was a mate efflux protein proposed to transport glycosylated flavan-3-ols in vivo <cit> . therefore, plant mate efflux proteins represent interesting short/long-distance transporter candidates for highly hydrophobic metabolites. in the process of shoot branching, the importance of auxin was already discussed. also is to consider the newly identified plant hormone strigolactones derived from carotenoids
 <cit> . several genes involved in their biosynthesis have been identified but knowledge of both the biosynthesis pathway and the transport of strigolactones and their intermediates is still incomplete
 <cit> . how some highly hydrophobic intermediates such as carotenoid-derived compound can be transported within the cytoplasm of the cell or on more long distance? the mate family proteins identified are good candidates for such a function and need now to be considered further.

CONCLUSIONS
beyond the detection of qtls for growth and leaf traits, this study explored further the genomic resources as the genome sequence and its annotation to identify candidate genes for the traits under study. for sylleptic branches, candidate genes identified by enrichment tools analysis of genes inside qtl confidence intervals were promising. nevertheless, the improvement of poplar genome annotation and the reduction of qtl confidence intervals might help to refine this strategy of candidate gene discovery.
