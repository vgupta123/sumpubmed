BACKGROUND
several reasons make grapevine particularly interesting: it is the most cultivated fruit plant covering approximately  <dig>  million hectares in  <dig> , with a long history of domestication, as well as a useful model organism since it seems to have maintained the ancestral genomic structure of the primordial flowering plants. the complete genome sequence was obtained in  <dig> by two independent projects
 <cit> . the availability of the genomic sequence gave the opportunity to conduct several genome-wide studies focused on different aspects of grape biology such as berry development and response to different biotic and abiotic stresses
 <cit> .

however the eukaryotic transcriptome, and in particular the plant transcriptome, is far more complex than previously believed, alternative splicing and non coding transcripts being amongst the major causes contributing to this complexity. recent works pointed out the extensive diffusion of these phenomena in plants and their importance in gene expression and stress response
 <cit> .

alternative splicing  is one of the main mechanisms that forge transcriptome plasticity and proteome diversity
 <cit> . different studies based on computational analysis on both expressed sequence tags and high-throughput rna sequencing provide an estimate of the frequency of these events. for example, 20–30% of transcripts were found to be alternatively spliced in both arabidopsis thaliana and rice  by employing large-scale est-genome alignments
 <cit> . recently, deep sequencing of the transcriptome using high-throughput rna sequencing  increased this estimate showing that more that 60% of intron-containing genes in arabidopsis are alternatively spliced
 <cit> . although most as events of plants have not yet been characterized, there is a strong evidence indicating that they are spatially and developmentally regulated, playing important roles in many plant functions such as stress response
 <cit> . moreover, since as events are different at intraspecific level in several plant species, it was suggested that they may be correlated with niche specialization resulting from domestication in different geographical regions
 <cit> .

recently, the human cell transcriptional landscape was extensively investigated by the encode project
 <cit>  revealing that most genes tend to express several isoforms at the same time, with one isoform being predominant across different cell types. moreover a recent study confirmed these observations, showing that for 80% of the expressed genes in primary tissue cultures, the major transcript is expressed at a considerably higher level  than any other isoform
 <cit> . similar extensive studies are still missing in plants.

some emerging evidence indicates that a large fraction of the eukaryotic genome is transcribed
 <cit>  and that a considerable amount of the transcriptome is composed by non-coding rna  that may play a key role as a regulator in many cellular processes. a poorly characterized class of plant ncrna is composed of long non-coding rna , mrna-like transcripts greater than  <dig> bases transcribed by rna polymerase ii, polyadenylated, spliced and mostly localized in the nucleus
 <cit> . in plants a systematic identification of long non coding transcripts has only been done for a few species
 <cit> . in arabidopsis for example, using a tailing-array based method liu et al. identified  <dig> long intergenic non-coding transcripts,  <dig> of which were confirmed by rna sequencing experiments
 <cit> . based on their characteristics, lncrnas can be classified as natural antisense transcripts , long intronic noncoding rnas and long intergenic noncoding rnas . some of these transcripts have been shown to be involved in important biological processes such as developmental regulation and stress response, although the detailed mechanisms by which they operate are mostly unknown
 <cit> . moreover, several lncrnas were found to be involved in plant reproductive development
 <cit>  and responses to pathogen invasion
 <cit> . furthermore it has been observed both in plant
 <cit>  and in vertebrate
 <cit>  that lncrnas have both tissue and temporal-dependent expression patterns.

the extent and complexity of the transcriptional landscape in plants is not yet well characterized. recent advances in high-throughput dna sequencing technologies applied to transcriptome analyses have opened new and exciting possibilities of investigation
 <cit> . rnaseq has been successfully applied in several studies including gene prediction improvement
 <cit> , isoform identification
 <cit> , isoform quantification
 <cit> , non-coding transcript discovery
 <cit> .

here we present a deep survey on the grape transcriptome, based on  <dig> rnaseq solid libraries from leaf, root and berry, from different genotypes under different physiological and stress conditions.

the high coverage of our samples allowed us to review the vitis vinifera gene annotation and to extend it to include alternative spliced isoforms. the impact of alternative splicing on mirna target sites was also investigated. our data showed that alternative splicing is correlated to tissue as well as genotypes. finally, we developed a stringent pipeline to identify long non-coding rnas, that were annotated based on their expression in different tissues and stress conditions.

RESULTS
dataset
rnaseq data came from a parallel work  aiming to study the response to water-deficiency and salt stresses of two rootstocks, the widely used  <dig>  and the experimental m <dig>  kindly provided by prof. a. scienza, university of milan . the commercial rootstock  <dig>  was derived from a cross of v. riparia x v. rupestris, while m <dig> is an experimental rootstock derived from a cross of  x v. berlandieri cv. resseguier n.1
 <cit> . it should be noticed that although v. vinifera, v. riparia, v. rupestris and v. berlandieri are generally classified as  <dig> different species, they are all able to cross fertilize and to produce fertile progenies; therefore, they are strongly related and should be considered as the same biological species. as a background work of the project  the two rootstock genomes were resequenced. we found that the average frequency of single nucleotide variants is about 1/ <dig> bases, very similar to what is found when comparing different v. vinifera cultivars. excluding possible gene family expansions, no private genes were found in the rootstock genotypes. this further supports the idea that we are working on the same biological species. in any case, the aim of this work was not the annotation of a vitis “pangenome”, but the improvement of the vitis vinifera reference genome.

some rnaseq analyses were also performed on cabernet sauvignon, that is a well known cultivar of v. vinifera. more details can be found in the materials and methods section. a total of  <dig> samples from leaves, roots and berries were sequenced using solid technology producing approximately  <dig> billion of directional 75/ <dig> bases paired-end rnaseq reads.

improvement of the grape gene prediction
the grape gene prediction and annotation , available before the present work is referred to as v <dig> and followed the v <dig> annotation soon after the release of the grape pn <dig> genomic sequence
 <cit> . the v <dig> annotation improved to some extent the previous annotation and now it represents the generally used gene reference of grape. the new potential of rnaseq technology is now revealing some weaknesses of the v <dig> annotation and at the same time offering the opportunity for a through and systematic study of the grape transcriptome.

two recent works raised some concern about the v <dig> annotation. firstly, a comparison between v <dig> and v <dig> showed that  <dig>  genes annotated in v <dig> were not present in v1
 <cit> . although some of those genes may be artefacts, others are certainly genuine grape genes and should be reintegrated into the annotation. secondly, the v <dig> annotation did not attempt to describe alternative isoforms. this was pointed out by a de novo transcriptome assembly of rnaseq of v. vinifera cv. corvina, that allowed the identification of  <dig>  splice isoforms among  <dig>  known genes and  <dig>  potentially novel protein coding genes
 <cit> .

motivated by these observations we improved and updated the grape gene prediction, integrating the information derived from the considerable amount of newly available data and setting up rigorous bioinformatic procedures based on several filtering steps, to limit the number of artifactual genes.

a detailed workflow describing the different steps of the analysis is presented in figure 
 <dig>  the general analysis of the rnaseq data was based on the “align-then-assemble” strategy. firstly, the rnaseq reads from  <dig> libraries were aligned onto the reference grape genome using pass
 <cit> . then the spliced reads that were not sufficiently supported were discarded as described in the methods section. secondly, we used three different software to reconstruct the transcripts: cufflinks
 <cit> , isolasso
 <cit>  and scripture
 <cit> . since the  <dig> rnaseq libraries corresponded to  <dig> different replicated samples, we merged together the alignments from each replica, thus obtaining  <dig> datasets. we obtained an average number per dataset of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reconstructed transcripts respectively for cufflinks, isolasso and scripture . finally, in order to reduce the number of misassembled transcripts and artefacts, we removed all the assemblies that were not predicted by at least two of the three programs. to reconstruct the transcripts, all the datasets were clustered with pasa
 <cit>  producing  <dig>  individual isoforms, belonging to  <dig>  genes .

the gene prediction was performed in two different steps. firstly, we updated the v <dig> gene prediction incorporating the rnaseq reconstructed transcripts using the pasa software
 <cit>  . pasa is a tool designed to model and update gene structures using alignment evidence and it is able to correct exon boundaries, add utrs and model for alternative splicing. secondly, we performed a new gene prediction integrating evidence from ests, proteins and rnaseq . this second step identified  <dig>  new genes, 80% of which were found to have at least one gene ontology annotation . gene enrichment analysis revealed that the addition of these new genes endowed the list of functional categories with functions that were previously under-represented . among the most significant categories, we found terms related to nucleotide binding site such as “adp binding”, “adenyl ribonucleotide binding” or “purine ribonucleotide binding”. interestingly, most genes associated with this domain are annotated as “disease resistance”
 <cit> .

the new gene prediction, called v <dig>  contains  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  transcripts . the v <dig> gene prediction showed several differences from the previous prediction, such as longer transcripts and coding sequences  and a higher number of exons per gene. as reported in table 
 <dig>  the incorporation of the rnaseq information led to an important improvement in the prediction of the untranslated regions . the v <dig> utrs prediction was based on est data and suffered from the lack of information at the 5′ and 3′ end of transcripts, due to the scarce yield of full length cdnas in the est data. rnaseq data provided a decisive contribution to overcome this problem. we found that in the v <dig> gene prediction the number of genes with a 5′ and 3′ utrs rose respectively, from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig> . moreover, we found that the average utr length of v <dig> is twofold longer than v <dig> .

to evaluate the quality of the exon/intron splicing sites we performed a comparison between v <dig> and v <dig> gene predictions and we found that almost 97% of the v <dig> introns are predicted also in v <dig>  to further asses the quality of the two predictions, we used three different sources of evidence, proteins, ests and rnaseq, and we were able to confirm 92% of the shared introns. interestingly, the analysis showed that almost 29% of the introns are supported by at least two different independent sources of evidence while this number rose to 58% when we considered all the three sources, demonstrating the high quality of the exon/intron boundaries of both gene predictions. more details are available in additional file
2: table s <dig> and s <dig>  when we analysed the splicing sites exclusive to one or the other gene prediction, we were able to confirm only 46% of v <dig> introns against 85% of the introns confirmed in the v <dig>  as expected, we found that the majority of these exclusive splicing sites are confirmed only by one evidence. in particular we found that the major contribution to the v <dig> exclusive splicing site is given by the rnaseq data.

as described above, the v <dig> prediction was generated from v <dig> using the pasa software, without further manual revision. we observed that v <dig> and v <dig> are very similar; however we found  <dig> v <dig> genes derived from the fusion of  <dig> v <dig> genes, while  <dig> v <dig> genes were derived from the splitting of  <dig> v <dig> genes . to discriminate between false/positive fusion/splitting events, we performed a similarity search of each group of fused/split proteins against the arabidopsis proteome . we evaluated the number and the consistency of the best hit to determine the reliability of the fusion/splitting events . we found that of the  <dig> fused genes,  <dig> find a better match on v <dig>  while  <dig> on v <dig>  whereas of the  <dig> split genes,  <dig> have a better match on v <dig> and  <dig> on v <dig> .

a further comparison between v <dig> and v <dig> showed that  <dig>  genes have a different coding sequence in the two predictions. for each pair of alternative prediction we performed a global pairwise alignment using the arabidopsis homologous protein as reference. the results show that the majority of v <dig> genes have a higher score than v <dig>  suggesting that they have a better gene structure .

finally we performed a comparison at functional level using interproscan annotation. we were able to annotate  <dig>  v <dig> genes with at least one interpro domain, while this number rose to  <dig>  genes when we considered v <dig> gene prediction. as reported in additional file
2: figure s <dig>  v <dig> is better both in terms of number of domains identified and number of annotated genes.

alternative splicing prediction and analysis
we observed that 90% of v <dig> predicted genes  contain two or more exons, and 30%  of these undergo alternative splicing producing  <dig>  different isoforms. we also found that 64% of the alternative spliced genes produced more than two isoforms . analysis of the acceptor-donor sites shows that  <dig> % are canonical gt-ag pairs, while 1% are gc-ag and  <dig> % a combination of less frequent non canonical sites. .

we used astalavista
 <cit>  to identify and classify the different types of alternative splicing. we identified  <dig>  alternative splicing events, affecting 17% of all the introns, distributed into five main categories: intron retention, exon skipping, alternative donor, alternative acceptor and complex events . we found that the most common event is intron retention, involving 77% of the alternatively spliced genes. this as category is mainly represented by transcripts in which a single intron is optionally included and occurred in 51% of the as events. on the contrary, exon skipping occurred only in  <dig> % of the cases. moreover we found that the use of alternative acceptors  is more frequent than the use of alternative donors . these results are consistent with other studies
 <cit>  supporting the idea that intron retention is a common event in plants. in figure 
 <dig> panel e, we compared the size distribution of the retained introns  with that of the total introns , the constitutive introns , the alternatively spliced introns  and the alternative splicing events excluding the intron retention events . we found that the size distribution of retained introns is considerably smaller than the intron size of other as , supporting the hypothesis that intron retention is related to intron size
 <cit> .

we also performed an analysis to identify which gene regions preferentially undergo alternative splicing. we found that about 70% of all as events occur at the protein-coding level, while 18% and 11% occurred respectively, at the 5′ utr and 3′ utr regions. the remaining 1% of the as events occurred between a coding sequence and a utr. these values compared reasonably well with the extension of coding sequences , 5′utrs  and 3′utrs , indicating that all regions of the transcript are susceptible to alternative splicing without any significant preference. the findings that alternative splicing may not be limited to the sole production of protein diversity also emerged from arabidopsis <cit> . moreover of all the genes with at least one isoform, 46% have alternative start sites, while 60% have alternative stop codons.

alternative splicing affects mirna target sites
unlike animal mirnas that usually recognize their target on the 3′utr region, plant mirnas do not show preferences in terms of target position
 <cit> . to evaluate the impact of the v <dig> gene prediction on mirna target prediction, we performed a target analysis using the psrnatarget server
 <cit> . as reported in table 
 <dig>  the v <dig> prediction shows an increased number of mirna target sites allowing the identification of targets for  <dig> more mirnas and  <dig> new target genes. interestingly, more that 79% of the target sites in the v <dig> prediction were identified on coding sequences, while in v <dig> those were only 55%. on the other hand we found that target regions on 3′ utrs and 5′ utrs increased from 11% to 27% and from 9% to 18% respectively on v <dig> compared to v <dig>  reassessing the importance of utr regions in plant mirna target identification .

we investigated the effect of alternative splicing on mirna target sites. a recent analysis of arabidopsis <cit>  revealed that mrna splicing seems to be a possible mechanism to control mirna-mediated gene regulation. indeed, alternative splicing could produce different isoforms which may or may not contain functional binding sites, playing an important role in modulating the interaction between mirna and target.

to test this hypothesis, for each gene with alternative splicing we checked if the target sites were predicted to be present across all the isoforms. we found  <dig> cases, involving  <dig> mirna and  <dig> genes , in which a mirna binding site is missing in one or more isoforms. our analysis revealed that in 43% of the cases the missing binding site is the result of a differential mrna initiation or termination. 54% of the remaining events occurred at the 5′utr, 21% at the 3′utr and 23% at the coding sequence, involving in 46% of the cases intron retention events.

the identification of target sites relies entirely on in silico prediction, therefore the results need to be taken with some care. however, although these data need further experimental validation, they suggest the presence of this intriguing regulatory mechanism also in grape. further analyses to validate the mirna target sites are required to better understand the complexity of mirna-target interaction and the impact of alternative splicing on modulating mirna gene regulation.

comparison of alternative splicing in different tissues, genotypes and stress conditions
we analysed the expression of the predicted isoforms of each gene across all the samples. for each isoform we estimated the fpkm  expression level using two different programs: cufflinks and flux-capacitor . both methods gave very similar results; here we refer to those obtained with cufflinks. we assumed that a fpkm between 1– <dig> corresponds approximately to  <dig> rna molecule per cell
 <cit> . although we are aware that also low-expressed transcripts may have a functional role, we decided to exclude from our analysis those with a fpkm smaller than  <dig>  because of the uncertainty due to the low number of reads and the approximation of the programs for isoform quantification would yield to low quality results.

the first aspect that we investigated was the number of different isoforms that can be identified comparing different tissues, genotypes and stress conditions. we grouped the samples into three main categories: tissue , genotype  and stress conditions  and counted how many transcript variants are shared among the different datasets. cabernet sauvignon berries were not considered in this analysis because a comparable berry dataset was not available for  <dig>  and m <dig> genotypes. the analysis was performed considering only the genes expressed across all the samples in order to minimize the bias due to the genes that are turned off. in figure 
 <dig> it can be seen that tissues show the highest difference between alternative isoforms, with more than 8% of different variants; genotypes show between  <dig> to 7% of non-shared variants, while stress conditions show between  <dig> to 7% . the observation that the extent of change in alternative splicing due to stress is similar to that seen in different tissues is a clear indication of its role in stress response. it should be considered that the status of a transcript being turned on or off depends on its detectability that in turn is dependent on the coverage. as a result we would expect that genes expressed at a low level would produce a minor number of detectable isoforms. indeed, we found a correlation between the number of identified isoforms and the level of gene expression .

genotypes also exhibit considerable variability in splicing. it is interesting to note that the number of different isoforms is greater between genotypes than between plants undergoing different stress conditions. overall these data indicate that to better understand the molecular bases of phenotypic traits we should also consider the differences in alternative splicing.

when we compared the relative abundance of the variants of individual genes, we found that in most cases there is a single transcript that has a considerable higher level of expression rather than a subset of transcripts with similar expression. figure 
 <dig>  panel a shows that the fpkm value distribution of the major transcript has a median value of  <dig>  while the second and third variant have a median value of  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. when we calculated the ratio between the expression values of the first and second most abundant isoforms, we found that in 60% of the cases the ratio was higher by at least 2-fold and in 25% of the cases 5-fold . next, we verified how many isoforms were simultaneously co-expressed in the different samples . we noticed that genes tend to co-express a low number of isoforms, typically two, and there seems to be no correlation between number of co-expressed isoforms and number of predicted variants. these results are quite different from those observed in human
 <cit>  where genes express many isoforms simultaneously and the number of expressed isoforms is correlated to the number of predicted variants. finally, we verified if there is a tendency of the major isoform to be recurrent across the different samples. for each gene expressed in at least two samples, we identified the major isoform and counted how many times it was the most abundant across the samples. in  <dig>  genes  we found that the same major isoform was expressed across all the samples where the gene is expressed . similar studies have been recently reported also for human where a survey on  <dig> different tissues revealed that 35% of the genes tend to express the same major isoform
 <cit> . this result is strongly correlated to the dataset. the extension of the analysis to more samples would probably reduce the number of genes in which the major isoform remains the same.

evolutionary adaptation by tuning the alternative splicing machinery
in the previous paragraph we showed that in 54% of the genes the major isoform remains the same across all the samples, while in the remaining 46% the two major isoforms change. to identify possible correlations between alternative splicing and sample types we performed a principal component analysis . for each gene we considered the two major isoforms amongst all the samples . the pca was performed on the log ratio of the first and the second major isoform expression values. the dots in figure 
 <dig> represent the  <dig> samples that are visualized according to tissue and genotype .

the pca analysis shows some interesting and unexpected results, figure 
 <dig>  panel a, b and c show the scatter-plot among the first three pca components. the first two components  show that alternative splicing switching events are strongly correlated to the tissue type as the samples from the same tissue tend to cluster together. unexpectedly, when the third pca component is taken into account , the samples are further separated according to the rootstock genotype. this suggests the possibility that differences amongst genotypes may also arise from changes in the general splicing regulation program, thus supporting the idea that the evolutionary adaptation to a sudden and strong selective pressure  may be achieved by modifications of the splicing machinery.

to further investigate this hypothesis we considered the serine/arginine-rich proteins , that are known to be involved in pre-mrna splicing processes and regulate alternative splicing by changing the splice site selection in a concentration dependent-manner. several studies demonstrated that sr proteins are differentially expressed in different tissues and cell types, and that plant sr genes can produce alternative transcripts with a level of expression that is controlled in a temporal and spatial manner
 <cit> .

therefore we investigated if there was a significant difference in the expression level of grape sr genes that could be correlated with a different splicing program in tissues and genotypes. firstly, we performed a blast similarity search  using the  <dig> sr proteins identified in arabidopsis <cit>  to identify the orthologous sequences in the grape genome. we were able to identify  <dig> grape genes as reported in table 
 <dig>  secondly, we compared the mean expression values of the genes grouping the samples according to genotype and tissue type. when the samples are grouped according to genotype, we did not find any significant difference between the genes of the two groups, with the exception of the gene vit_212s0142g <dig> ; however, when the analysis was done taking into consideration the expression level of the isoforms, we found four differentially expressed variants : vit_216s0098g <dig>  , vit_215s0048g <dig>  , vit_204s0069g <dig>   and vit_216s0100g <dig>  . finally, when the samples were grouped according to tissue, we found that almost all the sr genes were markedly differentially expressed , thus confirming the results shown in figure 
 <dig> and indicating that switches in alternative splicing plays a very important role in the definition of tissues and to a lesser extent in genotypes.
arabidopsis


we also performed a pca on the expression pattern of genes rather than isoforms and we found that tissues are resolved by the first two components , while genotypes cannot be resolved, even when the second and third components are considered . we can conclude that the two different genotypes showed more marked differences in alternative splicing than in change in the level of gene expression.

non coding transcripts
to identify long non coding transcripts  we developed a stringent filtering pipeline to discriminate between coding and non coding sequences and to eliminate possible errors of assembly. briefly, we identified putative lncrnas based on their expression level and genomic context and only if they had no coding potential, no possible homology with proteins or protein domains and no homology with repeated sequences. lncrnas can be classified as natural antisense transcripts , long intronic noncoding rnas and long intergenic noncoding rnas  according to their genome location. depending on the type of lncrna, we applied different filters to avoid false positives due to several possible sources of errors, as for example missing utrs or intron retention events. further details can be found in the materials and methods section.

this procedure led to the identification of  <dig>  long non coding rna divided into  <dig> intronic,  <dig>  intergenic and  <dig> antisense transcripts. we analysed the structure, the expression level and the conservation of these lncrna. we found that grape lncrna were on average smaller than protein coding genes . moreover we found a considerable difference between the length of antisense lncrna and the other two types of long non coding rna . we found that grape lncrnas are generally monoexonic and that only 11% of intergenic,  <dig> % of intronic and 5% of antisense lncrnas have more than one exon. consequently to this monoexonic structure, we found that only a low number of lncrnas undergoing alternative splicing:  <dig> intergenic lncrna produced  <dig> different isoforms while  <dig> antisense lncrnas produced  <dig> variants. we did not detect any isoforms for intronic lncrnas. these findings are quite different from what was found in human were the majority of lincrnas are composed by two exons
 <cit> .

to verify if the high number of monoexonic lincrnas was due to low coverage problems, we looked for a possible correlation between lincrna structure and level of expression. as shown in additional file
2: figure s <dig>  the expression level distribution of both monoexonic and multiexonic lincrnas is quite similar, suggesting that monoexonic lincrnas structure is not due to low sample coverage.

we performed a similarity comparison between grape lncrna and the long non coding rna identified in arabidopsis <cit> . despite the use of a relaxed e-value threshold , we identified a very small number of matches. in details we found that only  <dig> intergenic,  <dig> intronic and  <dig> antisense non coding transcripts had at least one match. this result confirms the observation that very few lncrnas are clearly conserved across species
 <cit> .

analysis on the expression level revealed that lncrnas are on average 10-fold less abundant than protein coding genes . similar results have also been found both in arabidopsis <cit>  and in vertebrates
 <cit>  suggesting that short sizes and low expression levels may be general characteristics of long non-coding rna and probably related to their differences in biogenesis, processing, stability and function compared to mrna.

we performed a principal component analysis of the expression values of lncrnas across all the samples. figure 
 <dig>  panel a shows that the first two pca components clearly indicate a tissue-specific expression pattern. moreover we investigated the expression of lncrnas in relation to stress conditions. strong evidence support the hypothesis that long non coding transcripts are involved in the response to different stresses, including biotic stresses and pathogen infections
 <cit> . pca analysis however was unable to efficiently separate the samples according to the stress condition, indicating that the tissue-specificity has a stronger effect on lncrna expression regulation. nevertheless venn diagrams of lncrnas distribution according to tissue  and stress conditions , show that even though many lncrnas are tissue-specific, as already suggested by pca analysis, there is a considerable number of lncrna that are induced by stress conditions. we found  <dig> lncrnas that are uniquely induced during water stress,  <dig> during salt stress and  <dig> that are common between the two stress conditions.

the rnaseq data used in this study has been deposited at the ncbi short read archive  under the following sra accession: sra <dig> and sra <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we present an improved grape gene prediction, named v <dig>  based on the incorporation of a great amount of rnaseq data. a considerable number of new genes have been identified, including many genes related to lncrnas. the sequencing libraries were produced with a procedure that assured a high directional accuracy, that is particularly important in the annotation of lncrna and for the identification of anti-sense rnas. furthermore, with this study we have produced, for the first time in grape, a comprehensive description of alternative splicing in different tissues, genotypes and stress conditions. as observed in arabidopsis and now in grape, alternative splicing and non coding rnas contribute significantly to the transcriptional complexity and they should be taken into consideration in genome wide transcriptomic studies.

in plants, in particular in arabidopsis, it has been shown that many genes undergo regulated alternative splicing. serine/arginine-rich  and heterogeneous nuclear rnp  proteins are the main splicing factors  involved in constitutive as well as regulated as. the level of several sfs changes in different plant tissues
 <cit>  and in this study  we showed that this is true also in grape. similarly, stress and environmental conditions produce specific sf changes
 <cit> . thus, changes in the sf profile, driven by developmental and environmental conditions, contribute to the definition of the splicing specifications to be applied in different circumstances .

differences in alternative splicing have also been described between different ecotypes of arabidopsis <cit> , giving support to the argument that changes in splicing may contribute to the evolutionary adaptation process. a question that is still open is whether the changes in splicing observed in different arabidopsis ecotypes are due to specific alterations of the splicing sites or if they could be determined also by general modifications of the splicing machinery.

in this paper we show that like arabidopsis ecotypes, also grape genotypes exhibit some splicing specificity. interestingly, when we investigated if this could be due to changes in the splicing machinery we saw only minor differences in the level of expression of the  <dig> sr genes of grape , but when we investigated at the level of individual sr isoforms we found some very striking changes . another interesting observation is that the sf isoforms that are differentially expressed in the two genotypes did not show differential regulation in tissues. this suggests a possible mechanism of perturbation of the splicing machinery that would interfere only marginally with the splicing specifications required in different tissues. a more detailed description of these differences is given in additional file
2: table s <dig> and s <dig> and figure s9-s <dig> 

the finding that plants that practically belong to the same biological species have different splicing machineries is very intriguing and leads to interesting considerations and hypotheses. since sfs affect also the splicing of their own transcripts, small changes of the splicing machinery may reshape the as profiles to new points of equilibrium where each sf panel will produce the same sf isoforms. a more detailed knowledge of the specific role of each sf will help to better understand this problem.

finally, it should be considered that small changes of the splicing machinery could play an important role in evolutionary adaptation, providing an easy and quick generation of several “variations on the theme”, using parts that have already been tested , but changing their assortment. this could be particularly relevant in the response to sudden and strong selective pressures. therefore, it would be interesting to verify whether some of the intraspecific as differences that are often reported in different plant species and cultivars are due to changes of individual splicing sites or if they could result from the tuning of the splicing machinery.
