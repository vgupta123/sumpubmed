BACKGROUND
bone homeostasis is strictly regulated through a dynamic balance between osteoblastogenesis  and osteoclastogenesis   <cit> . in the former, osteoblasts  control bone formation through the synthesis of bone matrix proteins. in osteoclastogenesis, large multinucleated osteoclasts  remove the mineralized matrix of bone tissue, resulting in bone resorption. ocs are derived from hematopoietic precursors of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, and their differentiation is regulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor   <cit> . mutations in the m-csf gene induce defects in the formation of macrophages and ocs, which suggests that immune cells and bone cells are derived from the same progenitors  <cit> .

the receptor activator of nuclear factor -κb ligand , a member of the tumor necrosis factor  family, regulates oc maturation and differentiation  <cit> . bone-forming obs express rankl as do activated t cells which indicates a role for the immune system in osteoclastic bone resorption  <cit> . in addition, many inflammatory cytokines are known to modulate rankl expression, including tnf-α  <cit> , and the rankl dependence of several inflammatory bone diseases has been reported  <cit> . bone dysfunction may also arise following the production of rankl by activated t cells, by directly triggering osteoclastogenesis  <cit> .

osteoclasts express the receptor activator of nf-κb , a type i membrane protein. thus, the rankl/rank signaling cascade regulates not only the maturation of oc progenitors, but also the activity of ocs in normal bone remodeling  <cit> . given the critical functions of ocs, an understanding of the process that control their differentiation is required for the successful treatment of many bone pathologies.

carbon monoxide  is an invisible and odorless gas with a binding affinity for heme that is  <dig> times higher than that of oxygen. concentrations of co in the air exceeding 3%  are usually lethal  <cit> . co is endogenously produced by mammals, by the degradation of heme, albeit in very low concentrations  <cit> . interestingly, however, in small amounts  co exhibits anti-apoptosis, anti-proliferation, anti-inflammatory, and many other biological activities  <cit> . for example, co-releasing molecule- <dig> dose-dependently inhibits rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis  <cit> .

mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage raw  <dig>  cells are derived from abelson-virus-treated mice ascites and recognized as pre-ocs  <cit> . following their stimulation with rankl, these cells produce ocs in a pathway involving mitogen-activated protein kinases , extracellular-regulated kinase , p <dig>  jun n-terminal kinase , and c-fos  <cit> . in this study, we used rankl-treated raw <dig>  cells as an vitro model to investigate the effect of co on the signaling pathway of rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. in addition, in an approach using interactomics to obtain a protein-protein interaction  network, we derived a genome-scale ppi map to deduce the potential signaling pathways and member proteins involved in the differentiation and activation of ocs, and the effects of co on these pathways  <cit> .

RESULTS
inhibition of rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis in raw  <dig>  cells by low-dose co without preventing growth or inducing apoptosis
raw  <dig>  cells incubated with  <dig>   <dig>  and 20 ng rankl/ml for 96 h gave rise to trap multinucleated cells in a dose-dependent manner. when these rankl-treated progenitor cells were exposed to 250 ppm co, the formation of trap multinucleated cells was inhibited by 73 + 5% , 70+ 5% , and 41+ 10%  , we also check the effects of co on osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow macrophages and the results are the same as raw cells . moreover, after incubation with 250 ppm co for  <dig> or 96 h, rankl-treated raw  <dig>  cells retained their ability to proliferate and the expression of activated caspase- <dig>  a marker of apoptosis, was not induced .

co-induced inhibition of f-actin ring formation by osteoclasts
formation of the f-actin ring by ocs is a necessary step in bone resorption. as shown in figure 2a and figure 2b, in raw  <dig>  cells treated with 20 ng rankl/ml and 250 ppm co for 96 h, f-actin ring formation was reduced . a similar inhibitory effect of osteoclast pit formation, an indicator of bone resorption, was observed on dentin discs in the co but not the air group.

co-induced suppression of rankl-induced jnk and c-jun phosphorylation, and c-fos but not iκb-α expression
the activation of nf-κb plays an important role in the differentiation of pre-ocs. as shown in figure 3a, in raw  <dig>  cells exposed to 20 ng rankl/ml and 250 ppm co there was no change in the expression of iκb-α, which is normally induced by nf-κb and serves as its inhibitor. furthermore, this same dose of co inhibited the phosphorylation of rankl-induced jnk and c-jun but not that of either erk or mitogen-activated protein kinase p <dig>  within 120 min . the same concentration of co down-regulated the expression of c-fos in similarly treated raw  <dig>  cells .

co-induced reduction of acp <dig>  ctsk, calcr, mmp <dig>  and nfatc <dig> expression
rank is expressed on the cell surfaces of pre-ocs and ocs. as shown in figure 4a, rank mrna expression in raw  <dig>  cells was not affected by 250 ppm co within 96 h. tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase , the calcitonin receptor , cathepsin k , and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  are unique markers of mature ocs. in raw  <dig>  cells treated with 20 ng rankl/ml for 96 h, 250-ppm co reduced the mrna expression levels of all four genes . moreover, the expression of the protein nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent  <dig> , which is the master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, was likewise significantly reduced .

critical roles of map3k <dig> and the jnk signaling pathway in rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis
the string database was used to construct a ppi map of rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. the map showed three protein clusters joined by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase  <dig>  as a potential hub protein . using ipa software , we identified the jnk protein family signaling pathway as a potential participant in the maturation of raw  <dig>  cells treated with 20 ng rank/ml and exposed to 250 ppm co .

discussion
the potential benefits of co have led to many studies of its possible therapeutic applications, which have been examined in different disease models. sato et al. showed that co prolonged the survival of mouse-to-rat cardiac grafts  <cit> . in mice with ischemic lung injury, the inhalation of co was reported to prevent their death  <cit> . the protective effects of co have also been demonstrated in animal models of autoimmune diseases  <cit> .

bone remodeling is a tightly regulated cycle involving the formation of bone by obs and its resorption by ocs. the latter are monocyte-macrophage lineage-derived cells whose differentiation and maturation is regulated by obs via rankl. excessive bone resorption, initiated by proinflammatory cytokines, also proceeds through rankl and leads to abnormal bone destruction. given the involvement of ocs in these processes, an understanding of their formation and function is crucial to prevent bone loss in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis.

in our study, small doses of exogenous co not only reduced the degree of inflammation and the expression of rankl. consistent with these results, co was shown to reduce joint destruction in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis  <cit> . however, the effect of co on rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis has not been investigated. in this study, the differentiation of pre-oc murine macrophage-like raw  <dig>  cells into multinucleated ocs was stimulated using recombinant rankl protein. this system was then used to examine the potential role of co in osteoclastogenesis. in these experiments, the expression of several oc markers was examined, including the glycosylated monomeric metalloenzyme trap, which is expressed at high levels by. differentiated ocs. in the presence of 250 ppm co, trap expression by rankl-stimulated raw  <dig>  cells that had differentiated into trap  multinucleated ocs was blocked . cytoskeletal reorganization in mature functioning ocs, including the formation of dot-like f-actin rings, was likewise inhibited in rankl-treated raw  <dig>  cells, whereas their growth was not, nor was apoptosis induced . thus, collectively, our data show that one of the effects of co is to inhibit the maturation of pre-ocs induced by rankl.

the regulatory mechanisms by which rankl and its intracellular signaling pathways enable pre-ocs to differentiate have been extensively studied  <cit> . rankl binds to rank expressed on the plasma membrane of oc precursors  <cit> , which then activates an intricate signaling cascade that includes nf-κb, c-fos, c-jun, mapks, and nfatc <dig>  <cit> . support for the role of this pathway in osteoclastogenesis comes from a previous study in which inhibition of c-fos expression in mice blocked oc differentiation and caused osteopetrosis  <cit> . iκb-α binds to nf-κb in the cytoplasm, thus maintaining the protein in an inactive form and tightly regulating its transcriptional activity. in our study, co had no effect on the nf-κb  pathway, as shown in a western blot analysis of iκb-α expression and measurements of rank mrna levels . however, co did inhibit the maturation of rankl-treated raw  <dig>  cells. so what is the nature of the signaling pathway involved in co-inhibited osteoclastogenesis? given the co-mediated reductions in c-jun and jnk phosphorylation and c-fos expression in rankl-treated raw  <dig>  cells , co could inhibit rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis by deactivating ap- <dig>  thus down-regulating c-fos, a component of this complex. the activity of ap- <dig>  is crucial for the auto-amplification of nfatc <dig>  <cit> , which is induced and activated by rankl signaling during the terminal differentiation of ocs  <cit> . among the oc-specific genes regulated by nfatc <dig> are acp <dig>  calcr, cstk, and mmp <dig> <cit> . in the presence of co, the mrna levels of all four genes was significantly reduced . in addition, co inhibited the translation of nfatc <dig> . together, these findings suggest that co acts on the mapk pathway to inhibit osteoclastogenesis by raw  <dig>  cells induced to differentiate by stimulation with rankl.

interactomics yields deep insights into the molecular mechanism of diseases and their intracellular signaling pathways  <cit>  but, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been used to profile osteoclastogenesis. in this study, a string database analysis of rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis established a ppi map with three clusters . cluster i is a highly symmetric, connected protein cluster with strong interactions. it contains fos, jun, retinoblastoma binding protein  <dig> , nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells inhibitor, beta , creb binding protein , peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma , nfatc <dig>  and mapks. rbbbp <dig>  also called rbap <dig>  is a histone h <dig> binding protein that binds to the c-fos transcriptional activation site to inhibit cell mitosis  <cit> . we found that the prevention of differentiation by rankl-treated raw <dig>  cells was accompanied by a decrease in c-fos expression, which suggests that co alters the action of rbbbp <dig> on c-fos during osteoclastogenesis. another cluster i protein, the nuclear receptor pparg, is pivotal for adipogenesis and interacts with histone deacetylase  <dig>   <cit> , contained in cluster ii along with hdac <dig>  hdacs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from an ϵ-n-acetyl lysine amino acid on histones, which are contained in cluster iii. in a previous report the use of shrna to inhibit hdac <dig> expression also inhibited oc formation whereas similar inhibition of hdac <dig> accelerated oc differentiation  <cit> . these findings suggest that the balance between hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> expression decides the fate of pre-ocs exposed to co. among the cluster iii histones are the histone h2a family  members x and z , and histone h <dig> family member 3a . histones are highly alkylated and comprise the major protein component of chromatin. the epigenetic regulation of histones by methylation and acetylation may provide regulatory control of oc differentiation. for example, the expression of nfatc <dig> induced by rankl is associated with the demethylation of trimethylated histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> and lysine  <dig>   <cit> .

proteins identified as controlling hubs are major, central proteins in ppi networks. as shown in figure 5a, c-jun strongly interacted with other proteins in cluster i, such as jnk <dig> and jnk <dig>  furthermore, this cluster interacts with map3k <dig> , a protein in the mapk pathway, through c-jun. abell et al.  <cit>  showed that mp3k <dig> regulates jnk <dig> and jnk <dig> to control the activity of histone acetyltransferase. it also controls cbp activity in trophoblast stem cells during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. in our interactomics analysis, map3k <dig> was designated as a hub protein that interacts with c-jun, thereby controlling the interaction between cbp and hdac <dig> during oc differentiation. ppi maps derived using the ipa software have been widely used to gain insight into molecular interactions, signaling pathways, and pathogenesis  <cit> . one of the advantages of this approach is data from a limited number of experiments can be analyzed. we therefore took advantage of this method to obtain a global understanding of the signaling pathways that are activated during osteoclastogenesis in the presence of co . our results showed that co significantly inhibited the expression of the transcriptional factors c-jun and c-fos, the protein partners of ap- <dig> , which suggests their involvement in the co-mediated blockade of oc differentiation. jnk <dig> and jnk <dig>  two proteins controlled by map2k <dig>  were shown to interact with jund and thereby alter the transcriptional activity of jun. the ipa ppi showed that in rankl-treated raw <dig>  cells exposed to co, map2k <dig>  a downstream regulator of map3k <dig>  <cit> , interacts with iκb-α and p <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a low concentration of co  was shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in rankl-treated raw <dig>  cells. an interactome identifying the ppi network involved in the observed effects allows the following conclusions. first, proteins that function as signal transducers, enzymes, and epigenetic regulators are significantly affected by co during rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis. second, co inhibits osteoclastogenesis through the mapk signaling pathway. third, string predicted that map3k <dig> is a major controlling hub protein. fourth, the interactomics software ipa not only predicted a critical role for map2k <dig> but also identified map3k <dig> as a hub protein. fifth, string and ipa provide overlapping, complementary information. while the data obtained with these tools are similar, the latter provided both a more complete ppi and an easier approach to understanding the behavior of each protein during co-regulated osteoclastogenesis. our research offers new data and thus new insights into co-regulated osteoclastogenesis. however, further detailed investigations into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are needed.
