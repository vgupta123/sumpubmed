BACKGROUND
language acquisition has often been studied by comparing native speakers with people who have learned a second language  later in life. central to many such studies is the hypothesis that sensitive or even critical periods exist in neural system development that provide windows of greater potential for learning. sensitive periods create particularly appropriate conditions for the acquisition of new skills and abilities. later in life, for many functional systems, this early plasticity is reduced or absent . in line with this hypothesis, many studies investigating the language abilities of l <dig> learners who learned a language late - for example after  <dig> years of age  <cit>  - have repeatedly documented poorer performances and different neural correlates of language processing compared to native speakers of the same language. further, behavioural studies have shown that syntax and phonology pose greater challenges for l <dig> learners than lexical-semantic aspects  <cit> .

as many l <dig> speakers have learned the language after an assumed sensitive/critical period, factors related to age of acquisition  have been found to explain the lower performance level to a large degree. indeed wartenburger et al.  <cit>  reported that the neural correlates of syntactic processing predominantly depend on aoa. by contrast the neural correlates of semantic processing were mainly defined by the proficiency level of the l <dig> learners. brain activations related to semantic processing as a function of proficiency were also found by lee et al.  <cit>  and perani et al.  <cit>  who postulated that the attained proficiency might better explain differences of the cortical representation among l <dig> learners than aoa.

another, less often investigated, factor that might influence l <dig> acquisition is the modality through which the l <dig> and the l <dig> have predominantly been acquired. congenitally deaf humans born to deaf parents learn both their l <dig> and l <dig> exclusively through the visual modality. thus, such individuals provide a unique opportunity to investigate the influence of the l <dig> modality on proficiency and neural correlates of the l <dig>  this approach allows for investigating modality invariant aspects of human language.

in the ongoing debate on language acquisition of deaf people, some authors have argued that sign languages and spoken languages compete for resources associated with language processing on a neuronal level  <cit> . therefore, the early acquisition of a signed l <dig> during the sensitive/critical period may occupy crucial brain systems necessary for learning a written language. advocates of this hypothesis have argued that language acquisition strongly depends on the modality through which the language has been mediated. in line with this perspective, it is possible to assume that the acquisition of a sign language prevents a successful subsequent acquisition of a spoken language later in life. therefore, advocates of the modality competition hypothesis would suggest that deaf children should not learn a sign language first, but rather acquire the language being spoken in their environment in the first place. however, the neural processing mechanisms of l <dig> speakers as a function of the modality of the l <dig> are yet almost unknown. the finding of different processing mechanisms for the l <dig> in deaf l2- and hearing l <dig> users would argue in favour of the competition hypothesis, while the finding of comparable processing mechanisms for language comprehension in these two groups would argue against the modality competition hypothesis. specifically, the competition hypothesis would predict the absence of typical language-related event related potentials  in native signers when they process written german.

deaf people are not able to learn a spoken l <dig> by hearing; they acquire german only through the visual modality. this leads to an acquisition of german without a representation of the typical sounds. we call the acquisition of german  by deaf l <dig> learners crossmodal acquisition, whereas the acquisition of german by hearing l <dig> learners is called intramodal. a comparable erp pattern for crossmodal and intramodal l <dig> acquisition would strongly argue for a development of language related processes independent of its modality.

in summary, the present study compared written german language processing of hearing and deaf l <dig> learners of german. the groups were matched for aoa of their l <dig>  erps of a group of hearing native speakers of german were used to assess general effects of l <dig> acquisition.

semantic and syntactic processing in native speakers
neural correlates of language processing are often investigated using a violation paradigm. in this paradigm, two otherwise identical sentences differ in only one word, which is correct or either semantically or syntactically incorrect. sentences of both types are presented via the visual or auditory modality while the electro-encephalogram  is simultaneously recorded. the difference in the average brain response to the incorrect and correct words is analyzed: semantic processes have commonly been associated with the n <dig> effect, a negativity which has most often been observed with a centroparietal maximum for written languages  <cit> . the amplitude of the n <dig> effect is inversely correlated with lexical expectancy and is considered to reflect lexical semantic integration processes  <cit> .

a series of recent studies have reported that semantic violations within the arguments of the verb sometimes evoke positive waves following the n <dig> in a sentence that is syntactically well formed  <cit> . it has been suggested that an enhanced complexity of such sentences causes enhanced processing demands that might be reflected in these late positivities  <cit> .

syntactic processes have been associated with early and later erp effects in written languages. the early effect, the left anterior negativity , has been found to start at around  <dig> ms following the presentation of different kinds of syntactic anomalies, such as morphological congruency violations  <cit> . it has been suggested that the lan either reflects genuine syntactic parsing processes  <cit>  and/or predominantly working memory functions related to complex processing operations  <cit> . it seems to indicate a rule-based mechanism related to a morphosyntactic anomaly detection  <cit>  and has been found to vary with the severity of a particular mismatch  <cit> .

following this negativity, a posteriorly distributed positivity, which has been called the syntactic positive shift   <cit>  or  p <dig>  <cit> , has been observed after anomalies in the phrase-structure of the sentence, garden-path sentences and after morphosyntactic violations. this erp has been considered to reflect the processing costs of the reanalysing process activated when an anomaly is detected  or genuine parsing processes.

of special interest for the present study are erp experiments manipulating subject-verb number agreement in written languages  <cit> . kaan  <cit>  investigated the erp correlates of violations of subject-verb number agreement in dutch. she found a lan-like effect for the time period between  <dig> and  <dig> ms after the critical word. this negativity, however, had a bilateral rather than left lateralized scalp distribution with a central maximum. hagoort et al.  <cit>  reported a p <dig> following subject-verb agreement violations, but did not analyse the time period between  <dig> and  <dig> ms after stimulus onset. by contrast, osterhout and mobley  <cit> , münte et al.  <cit> , and de vicenzi et al.  <cit>  reported both a lan and p <dig> for subject-verb number agreement violations in english, german and italian, respectively. kaan's  <cit>  finding of a bilaterally distributed lan-like negativity is no exception. numerous studies with native speakers reported a distribution of the lan effect, which was neither strictly left nor anterior: rodriguez-fornells, clahsen et al.  <cit> , in catalan, and osterhout and mobley  <cit> , in english, found a left temporal topography for syntactic violations; gross, say et al.  <cit>  observed a right anterior maximum for syntactic violations in italian; weyerts, penke et al.  <cit> , and münte et al.  <cit>  reported a bilateral frontocentral distribution for syntactic violations in german.

erp comparisons between l <dig> and l <dig> speakers
many studies have consistently shown a number of differences when comparing erps to an l <dig> and an l <dig>  these studies have demonstrated, in line with behavioural data, that semantic processing  seems to be less vulnerable to a delayed language acquisition than syntactic processing . thus, the erp patterns observed to an l <dig> differ more from those to a native language for syntactic processes than for semantic processes:

weber-fox and neville  <cit>  investigated chinese l <dig> learners of english with different aoa. a native-like functional organization of the brain for syntactic processes was found only in l <dig> learners with an aoa below four years. hahne and friederici  <cit>  investigated japanese l <dig> learners of german using phrase structure violations. in the native speakers, an incorrect compared to a correct sentence elicited an early lan  between 100- <dig> ms and a p <dig> between 500- <dig> ms, by contrast neither an elan nor a p <dig> were observed in the l <dig> group.

chen et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that chinese l <dig> learners of english, who were able to correctly detect subject-verb agreement violations, displayed an erp pattern different to that of native speakers of english. while they observed a lan followed by a p <dig> for native speakers, they found a central anterior negativity between  <dig> and  <dig> ms followed by a p <dig> for chinese l <dig> learners of english. the results suggest that l <dig> learners might use different processing strategies to achieve similar performance levels as native speakers. these differences between l <dig> and l <dig> learners associated with syntactic violations have been interpreted as the result of a reduced automaticity in l <dig> processing. this in turn may be due to an additional drain on working memory processing, since, in contrast to l <dig> learners, l <dig> learners must explicitly recapitulate the words and phrases in the l <dig>  <cit> . this hypothesis was supported by a functional magnetic resonance imaging  study that demonstrated a higher activity in a widespread cortical network shared by both languages during the processing of an l <dig> compared to an l <dig>  <cit> . late l <dig> learners have been hypothesized to rely more on the declarative memory system as opposed to l <dig> speakers who have been assumed to rely on procedural memory processes  <cit>  during language comprehension.

however, these interpretations have been questioned for a number of reasons as many studies have reported a variety of other influences that might contribute to differences between l <dig> and l <dig> speakers: in a study by osterhout et al.  <cit> , native speakers of french showed a p <dig> after subject-verb agreement violations in their native language, whereas for english l <dig> learners of french an n400-like effect was observed after the same violations. interestingly, after eight months of training, the l <dig> learners displayed a p <dig> to syntactic phenomena which are similar in french and english, but not to syntactic phenomena which are specific to french. such findings suggest that differences in l <dig> learning might depend on similarity between the l <dig> and l <dig> and proficiency level of the participants. indeed, tokowicz and macwhinney  <cit> , who investigated english  speaking learners of spanish , demonstrated that a subject-verb agreement violation elicited a p <dig> both for english and spanish. by contrast a determiner-noun agreement violation did not elicit a p <dig> effect in the l <dig> . however, clahsen and felser  <cit>  proposed that more subtle differences might emerge, regardless of the proficiency level if syntactic structures of higher complexity were used. indeed, even highly proficient l <dig> learners of english, with different l1s, did not process so called non-local grammatical phenomena in a native-like manner . further, a different involvement of executive processes  <cit> , higher between participant variability  <cit> , and different methods of training and allocation of attention  <cit>  might contribute to differences in the neural correlates and proficiency of l <dig> and l <dig> learners.

sign language processing
as in any natural language, different national languages and even different dialects exist in sign languages  <cit> . sign languages have evolved naturally in a similar way as spoken languages and continue to do so  <cit> . they exhibit the same linguistic structures as any natural language at all linguistic levels such as phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics  <cit> . even the time course of sign language development in children appears to be very similar to spoken languages  <cit> . numerous studies including fmri  <cit> , neuropsychological  <cit> , and erp studies  <cit>  have provided evidence for similar processing systems in oral and sign language comprehension  <cit> . for example, fmri studies have demonstrated similar activation patterns for both types of languages  <cit> .

deaf people as l <dig> learners
behavioural studies have shown that congenitally deaf people who had learned a signed language  as an l <dig> on schedule perform better in english  than congenitally deaf people who had learned asl as an l <dig> later in life   <cit> . most importantly, the first group did not differ in proficiency from hearing people who had learned english as an l <dig> after the acquisition of an oral l <dig> . these results provide strong evidence for the assumption that the acquisition of an l <dig> during the sensitive/critical period is, regardless of its modality, a necessary foundation for learning other languages later in life. similar as for hearing l <dig> learners, deaf l <dig>  learners were hardly distinguishable from native speakers in their erp correlates of semantic processing  <cit> .

predictions
the present study compared intramodal and crossmodal l <dig> acquisition. a group of hearing native speakers of german served as a control group  in order to compare them with hearing l <dig> learners of german  and congenitally deaf people who had started learning written german as an l <dig>  at a comparable age. in line with the recent literature  <cit> , we expected d-l <dig> to perform at a comparable level as h-l <dig>  both l <dig> groups were expected to perform worse than h-l <dig>  particularly in the syntactic condition.

for h-l <dig>  we expected to observe a centroparietally distributed n <dig> effect after semantically implausible words. following verb-agreement violations, we predicted a left anterior negativity  and a posteriorly distributed positivity .

since we expected syntactic processing to be more vulnerable to late acquisition than semantic processing, we anticipated a lack of or a different topography for the early syntactic negativity in h-l <dig>  since a p <dig> has often been found in hearing l <dig> learners as well  <cit> , we anticipated h-l <dig> to show a p <dig> effect in the syntactic conditions. for the semantic condition, a similar n <dig> effect was predicted for h-l <dig> as for h-l <dig> 

similar erp patterns for d-l <dig> and h-l <dig> would indicate similar brain mechanisms involved in intramodal and crossmodal l <dig> acquisition. by contrast, if a signed l <dig> modified the functional cerebral organization of language, we would expect the erp patterns for h-l <dig> and d-l <dig> to differ significantly.

the anova with the between participant factor group  and the within participant factors condition , hemisphere , and cluster  revealed no significant effects for the time epoch 300- <dig> ms neither for all three groups nor for any combination of two groups.

the comparison of all three groups for the time window of 600- <dig> ms yielded a significant interaction of gr, co, and he  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ).

the separate anovas for pairwise comparisons of two groups revealed an interaction of gr, co, and he  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) as well as an interaction of gr, co, he, and cl  =  <dig> ; ε =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) for the comparison of h-l <dig> and h-l <dig>  the violation effect was stronger for h-l <dig> than for h-l <dig> over the left hemisphere. all statistical results of the group comparisons for the semantic condition are shown in table  <dig>  the topographies are shown in figure  <dig>

syntactic condition
for time window 300- <dig> ms, the anovas with all three groups or any pairwise comparison did not reveal any significant gr and co effect.

further dividing this time epoch into three sub epochs showed that h-l <dig> differed from h-l <dig> for 300- <dig> ms  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> , gr, co, and cl: f =  <dig> ; ε =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) and from d-l <dig> for 366- <dig> ms  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). the significant differences between h-l <dig> and h-l <dig> for 300- <dig> ms and between h-l <dig> and d-l <dig> for 366- <dig> ms were expected since in both cases one of the groups showed a lan and the other did not show a significant lan effect within the interval. thus, they cannot be interpreted unequivocally.

as reported above, a negativity to syntactic violations was significant for sub epoch 366- <dig> ms in h-l <dig>  for sub epoch 366- <dig> ms in h-l <dig> and for sub epoch 300- <dig> ms in d-l <dig>  for a second topographic analysis we, therefore, compared these different time epochs between groups: the anova comparing the three groups revealed a stronger left lateralized negativity for h-l <dig> compared to d-l <dig>  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). no other comparisons reached significance level.

in the anova with three groups no significant effects were observed for the time epoch 600- <dig> ms. the anova with groups h-l <dig> and h-l <dig> revealed an interaction of gr and co  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) indicating a more pronounced p <dig> of h-l <dig> than h-l <dig>  the comparison of h-l <dig> and d-l <dig> did not show any significant effect.

the anova with groups h-l <dig> and d-l <dig> revealed an interaction of gr, co, and he  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) and gr, co, he, and cl  =  <dig> ; ε =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). the p <dig> was right lateralized for h-l <dig> but symmetrically distributed for d-l <dig>  a post-hoc analysis <dig> suggested that the topographical differences of h-l <dig> and both other groups are mainly due to a sustaining significant negativity at frontal clusters for h-l <dig> only. for an overview of all group comparison anovas in the syntactic condition see table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the topographies are shown in figure  <dig>

comparisons of group topographies
in order to verify the topographic group differences for semantic and syntactic violation effects, the difference waves of erps to correct words subtracted from erps to violations were both normalized  and z-score standardized.

summary group comparisons
semantic violations elicited a n <dig> followed by a positivity in all groups. the n <dig> topographies did not differ between groups. the positivity following semantic violations at 600- <dig> ms showed a more left lateralized distribution in group h-l <dig> compared to the symmetrical distribution in h-l <dig>  none of the other comparisons revealed significant differences.

the topography of the negativity following syntactic violations did not differ significantly between groups for the epoch 300- <dig> ms. by analyzing the sub epoch, i.e. the sub epoch with the most robust syntax effect in each group, we found a left lateralization in each group. however, in the h-l <dig> the effect extended more towards temporal areas. the following p <dig> effect was very similar across groups.

discussion
the present study compared the neural correlates of intra- and crossmodal l <dig> acquisition. behavioural and electrophysiological data were recorded from deaf  and hearing  l <dig> learners of written german, as well as from a group of hearing german native speakers . participants had to read and evaluate german sentences which were either correct or comprised a semantic or a syntactic violation. the erp results revealed an n <dig> effect followed by a positivity for semantic violations in all three groups of participants. syntactic violations elicited a left lateralized negativity and a subsequent p <dig>  thus, our data provide evidence that neural systems mediating intra- and crossmodal l <dig> acquisition do not principally differ but rather are astonishingly similar.

for the behavioural task, four, out of twelve, d-l <dig> were not able to reach the inclusion criterion of 60% correct responses for each condition, whereas all participants from the other two groups reached this criterion and were, thus, included in the eeg analyses. to account for this, we first discuss the eeg data of the high performing participants. a section which covers the behavioural data follows.

in the semantic condition, all groups showed a significant n <dig> effect. semantic processes, as reflected in the n <dig>  have been found to be generally less vulnerable than syntactic processes . our findings are in accord with the single existing previous study on deaf native signers processing a written l2: neville et al.  <cit>  found that an n <dig> after semantically implausible words in english was similar in deaf native signers of asl compared to hearing native speakers. additionally, we found a late positivity following the n <dig> for all three groups. a positivity after semantic violations has been reported in previous studies  <cit> . in a recent review, kuperberg  <cit>  suggested that positivities after semantic violations seem to be particularly likely when the sentence must be reanalysed immediately following the semantic violation. in the present study, the use of an acceptability judgement task might have favoured such a processing strategy. furthermore, the sentence medial position of the violation and the low complexity of the sentences possibly allowed for an immediate reanalysis, as well.

while processing syntactic aspects of german, h-l <dig> showed a left lateralized negative erp effect over the anterior and temporal cortex. both d-l <dig> and h-l <dig> displayed a significant negativity which was most pronounced over the left anterior electrode sites, as well. the negativity was followed by a posteriorly distributed p <dig> effect, which was present in all three groups of participants.

the comparison of the erps of deaf and hearing l <dig> learners allowed us to decide between the hypothesis that a competition between signed and spoken languages prevents a full acquisition of an oral language, on the one side, and the alternative hypothesis that the acquisition of any l <dig>  be it signed or spoken, can build a necessary foundation for learning a subsequent language, on the other side. in favour of the competition hypothesis, there have been a number of reports showing that the pre-implantation resting level and crossmodal activation level of auditory brain areas were negatively correlated with the degree of speech comprehension achieved with a cochlear implant  <cit> . interestingly, such negative correlations were observed for a change of scalp topography of visual evoked potentials elicited by visual motion stimuli, as well  <cit> . the present result, however, suggests that learning a signed instead of an oral language first, results in a comparable functional organization of the l <dig>  this finding is inconsistent with the competition hypothesis. thus, it might be speculated that crossmodal reorganizations of visual processing mechanisms might interfere with the functional recovery of auditory processing including speech. by contrast genuine language functions, such as semantics and syntax might use overlapping neural systems that are equally assessed by the languages irrespective of the modality through which they have been learned  <cit> .

the present study provides strong evidence for this assumption: the group of d-l <dig> exhibited semantic and syntactic erps in their l <dig> that were comparable to the erps of hearing l <dig> learners of german, even though german and dgs mediate genuine language functions in a structurally different manner. for example, grammatical information in dgs is predominantly spatially encoded. further, we expected to see considerably more developmental vulnerabilities for the syntactic aspects of language processing than for semantic aspects, as suggested by a number of previous studies  <cit> . the occurrence of a lan in deaf l <dig> learners is particularly meaningful since this erp effect is known to be highly vulnerable, even for l <dig> speakers  <cit> , for whom various different topographies have been reported  <cit> . despite the relatively small number of participants in the group of deaf signers compared to neurolinguistic studies on healthy individuals, we obtained a significant lan effect in d-l <dig>  underscoring that deaf native signers are capable of activating brain systems that are important for the processing of syntactic aspects of oral languages.

in this context, it has to be noted that, in contrast to many erp studies on l <dig> acquisition  <cit> , both of our l <dig> learner groups started to learn german quite early . we suppose that both groups of l <dig> learners were able to acquire the syntactic processes indicated by the lan because their aoa was, though delayed, still relatively early. thus both, the early aoa and the high level of competence reached , may be related to the elaboration of a processing module allowing an automatic parsing of written sentences of the l <dig>  although both factors may be partially mutually dependent. indeed, syntax related negativities and, thus, automatic parsing processes have been shown in other studies on verb-agreement violations in an l <dig> that was learned to a high proficiency  <cit> .

thus, our findings are in accord with the conclusions of neville et al.  <cit> , who supposed that grammar acquisition must have occurred before adolescence. in a sample of deaf native signers who had learned english after their early teens, neville et al.  <cit>  found that erps after closed class words, i.e. words that convey grammatical information, deviated qualitatively form the erps of hearing native speakers of english. particularly, the left anteriorly distributed n <dig> was absent in deaf native signers of asl. indeed, our participants started to learn their written l <dig> at a much earlier age  than neville et al.'s participants. interestingly, however, those deaf participants that had mastered the essentials of english grammar displayed an n <dig> which, moreover, was left lateralized. unfortunately, this study  does not yet allow for drawing conclusions why not all native signers achieve the same competence in their  l <dig> 

we expected h-l <dig> to make fewer judgement errors than both l <dig> groups and the performance of h-l <dig> and d-l <dig> to be comparable. indeed, h-l <dig> made fewer judgement errors in the correct condition than h-l <dig>  they moreover performed at a higher level than d-l <dig> in all three conditions. the d-l <dig> performed worse than h-l <dig> in the syntactic condition, as well. it has to be noted that four deaf participants had to be excluded from the data analyses due to not reaching an accuracy level of 60% correct responses. thus, our data are not in total agreement with the results of related studies  <cit> . among others, mayberry and lock reported that deaf native signers of asl performed equally well in an english language test as hearing l <dig> learners  <cit> . this inconsistency may be resolved by considering that having acquired a native language on time does not guarantee high levels of l <dig> proficiency. additionally, it requires engaging with and in the l <dig>  it is important to note considerable differences with regard to the development of literacy of the deaf in the usa and in germany: in germany the ideal of articulation practice and lip reading drills have dominated the classroom situation for a long time, especially in the generation of our participants  <cit> . in  <dig>  nett and wudtke  <cit>  and wudtke  <cit> , respectively, have reported that the percentage of deaf pupils that reached a reading level appropriate for their age was as low as 5%. this educational history of our participants might account for the overall lower performance of d-l <dig> compared to h-l <dig> and particularly for the relatively high performance-related drop-out rate in the group of deaf native signers. this observation is reinforced by chamberlain and mayberry  <cit> , who found that english reading proficiency of deaf signers of asl was predicted by competence in asl and, crucially, reading frequency. this indicates that an educational approach emphasizing articulation and lip reading at the expense of sign language may have discouraged many deaf pupils from engaging fully and frequently with reading materials. it provides a possible explanation for the huge inter-individual differences in reading proficiency among deaf native signers. in any case, our conclusions are restricted to relatively high proficient l <dig> learners. a generalization to the whole population of deaf native signers is not possible.

another major difference between deaf and hearing l <dig> learners of german has to be noted: the deaf participants learned german predominantly over the visual channel. they generally do not acquire expressive language to the same degree as hearing l <dig> learners. thus, the effects of the impoverished l <dig> learning opportunities might become more obvious for more complex sentences  <cit> , as felser  <cit>  proposed. it remains an open question for further research whether group differences between hearing and deaf groups and/or between native speakers and l <dig> learners would emerge with complex sentence constructions. nonetheless, our data provide clear evidence that language systems necessary to process semantic and syntactic aspects of language can, in principle, be set up and shaped by a sign language such that they can later be assessed by oral  languages.

CONCLUSIONS
from the present data we conclude that the neural correlates of l <dig> processing in individuals with a signed l <dig> highly resemble those of hearing l <dig> learners with a spoken l <dig>  in a group of deaf native signers who acquired written german as their l <dig>  we were able to observe all semantic and syntactic language-related erp effects well known from native speakers of oral languages. especially the early syntactic negativity, indicating syntactic language functions particularly vulnerable to experience, was observed even in deaf participants who acquired their l <dig> crossmodally. it follows that the access to language processing systems is not competitive between modalities. rather, the elaboration of these functions by input of one modality might facilitate the access by another modality, similarly to a monolingual context where good oral speech capacities   <cit>  are crucial for the development of high reading abilities  <cit> . overall, it seems justified to conclude that intra- and crossmodal l <dig> acquisition involve comparable neural systems.
