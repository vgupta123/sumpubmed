BACKGROUND
the unique viscoelastic properties conferred by gluten proteins in bread wheat are the basis of the flexible processing qualities in producing a wide range of food products for a large proportion of the world population. gluten proteins, also named prolamins, are classically divided into gliadins and glutenins, based on different solubilities in an alcohol/water mixture  <cit> . the gliadins are generally monomeric proteins, divided into three groups, α/β-, γ- and ω-gliadins, based on their electrophoretic mobilities at low ph  <cit> . glutenins form polymeric proteins stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. based on different molecular weights, glutenins can be classified into two groups, high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits   <cit> . lmw-gs are further divided into b-, c- and d-group subunits according to their mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis   <cit> .

in bread wheat, hmw-gs are encoded by genes at the orthologous glu- <dig> loci on the long arms of chromosomes 1a, 1b and 1d . each locus possesses two paralogous genes encoding one x- and one y-type subunit  <cit> . lmw-gs genes are located at the glu-a <dig>  glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci on the short arms of group  <dig> chromosomes. the lmw-gs genes at the glu- <dig> loci and the gliadin genes at the gli- <dig> loci are tightly linked and form gene clusters covering several centimorgans   <cit> . moreover, unlike the simple composition of hmw-gs, lmw-gs are encoded by a complex multigene family without the information of the exact number of genes  <cit> . a large number of genes and abundant allelic variations at glu- <dig> loci and their tight linkage with gliadin genes make it difficult to elucidate the composition and function of lmw-gs genes in bread wheat  <cit> .

sds-page is widely used to investigate the abundant seed storage proteins in bread wheat. based on the mobility of proteins in sds-page gels, whole seed proteins are divided into four groups, hmw-gs, d-group, b-group, and c-group. d-group proteins are mainly composed of ω-gliadin proteins, whereas b-group mostly consists of lmw-gs proteins, and c-group comprise α, β and γ-type gliadins and several lmw-gs proteins  <cit> . based on the different electrophoretic patterns, lmw-gs protein alleles encoded by glu- <dig> loci are designated alphabetically   <cit> . however, identification of the lmw-gs composition in breeding programs remains a significant challenge because determination of lmw-gs alleles with sds-page needs much experience. this is why the functions of lmw-gs alleles are not well characterized. gene-specific markers for glu-a <dig> and glu-b <dig> alleles were developed to identify different lmw-gs alleles. however, molecular markers for glu-d <dig> alleles are still not available due to the slight differences among alleles  <cit> . using bac library screening and proteomics methods, lmw-gs genes in norin  <dig> , glenlea  and xiaoyan  <dig>  were identified and characterized  <cit> . these studies greatly improved our understanding of the unique genes encoding different lmw-gs alleles in bread wheat. recently, based on the conserved and polymorphic structure of lmw-gs genes, we developed a lmw-gs gene marker system and a full-length gene cloning method  <cit> . they were successfully used to identify and characterize more than  <dig> lmw-gs genes in individual wheat varieties  <cit> . both methods are helpful in elucidating the composition of glu- <dig> alleles in lmw-gs genes of bread wheat.

the effects of glutenin alleles on dough properties and processing qualities were mostly studied in two types of populations: structured populations  and doubled haploid lines) derived from biparental crosses, and non-structured populations, general collections of varieties and breeding lines. due to the simple composition and easy identification of allelic variants of hmw-gs, the contributions of hmw-gs to dough properties and end-use quality were well investigated and widely used in breeding programs  <cit> . however, hmw-gs alone could not explain the variation in quality among wheat varieties, as lmw-gs also contributed to dough properties  <cit> . for example, lmw-gs alleles made a slightly larger contribution than hmw-gs to dough extensibility  <cit> . compared with hmw-gs, lmw-gs formed highly polymorphic protein complex and contain abundant allelic variation. using sds-page and allele-specific primers, lmw-gs alleles were identified in wheat collections or structured populations, and their effects on processing quality were analyzed and discussed. however, controversies were common in regard to different kinds of populations or collections. for example, cane et al.  <cit>  and eagles et al.  <cit>  reported that glu-a3e was correlated with inferior dough resistance and extensibility, whereas zheng et al.  <cit>  showed that glu-a3e was a favorable allele for dough-mixing properties. due to the complex composition of lmw-gs alleles and difficulties in distinguishing lmw-gs from gliadins in sds-page gels, the molecular genetic mechanisms behind the functional differences of lmw-gs alleles are not well investigated.

in the present study, a set of near-isogenic lines  containing five glu-a <dig> alleles, eight glu-b <dig> alleles and five glu-d <dig> alleles, was used to study the effects of lmw-gs on the composition of glutenin macro-polymers , dough properties, and pan bread making quality. these nils were investigated using sds-page, the lmw-gs gene marker system and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  for identifying the composition of lmw-gs genes and proteins in each lmw-gs allele, and analyzing their association with dough properties and bread-making quality.

RESULTS
separation of lmw-gs proteins in aroona nils using sds-page
the glutenin alleles in the flour of  <dig> aroona nils were separated by sds-page . aroona possessed five hmw-gs proteins, viz.,  <dig>  7 +  <dig> and 2 +  <dig>  encoded by genes at glu-a <dig>  glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci, respectively. all nils had the same hmw-gs as aroona, and their unique lmw-gs and gliadin bands were labeled in figure 1a. four glu-a <dig> nils possessed unique lmw-gs bands at the b-group region from aroona . aroona-glu-a3d and aroona-glu-a3e also contained specific gliadin bands . among eight glu-b <dig> nils, aroona , aroona-glu-b3a, b3f and b3g shared similar b-group proteins, whereas aroona-glu-b3c, b3d, b3h and b3i showed another group of electrophoretic patterns . among the latter four nils, aroona-glu-b3c possessed the lowest quantity of b-group lmw-gs proteins , especially the protein with the largest molecular weight. four glu-d <dig> nils and aroona shared the same b-group lmw-gs proteins . aroona-glu-d3b and d3d had the same protein bands and contained one unique lmw-gs from aroona. except for one gliadin protein, the electrophoretic pattern of aroona-glu-d3a was the same as those of aroona-glu-d3b and d3d. aroona-glu-d3f produced a quite different protein pattern in the c-group region compared with other glu-d <dig> nils. generally, the glu- <dig> loci were tightly linked with gli- <dig> loci  <cit> , and it was difficult to break this linkage through genetic recombination in conventional crosses. thus, each glu- <dig> nil not only possessed unique lmw-gs but also contained  <dig> or  <dig> specific gliadins.

dissecting genes encoding lmw-gs alleles in the aroona nils
to analyze the genes encoding lmw-gs alleles in aroona nils, we investigated the  <dig> aroona nils using a previously developed lmw-gs gene marker system, that was efficient in separating lmw-gs genes in bread wheat   <cit> . eighteen lmw-gs genes were identified in aroona, including four glu-a <dig> genes , four glu-b <dig> genes , and eight glu-d <dig> genes  . the other two novel genes corresponding to dna fragments  <dig> and  <dig> present in all  <dig> lines  were pseudogenes with premature termination codons in the cds regions. among  <dig> aroona nils, aroona-glu-d3f possessed  <dig> unique genes, with the least number of lmw-gs genes, whereas aroona-glu-a3d had the largest number of lmw-gs genes . comparison of the lmw-gs genes among nils indicated that each nil differed from aroona at only one glu- <dig> locus. with the help of the complete gene sequences available in aroona nils and some other wheat varieties  <cit> , the composition of lmw-gs genes in each aroona nil was well characterized.

a bold numbers indicate active lmw-gs genes.

for glu-a <dig> alleles, 4– <dig> genes were identified in aroona  and four glu-a <dig> nils . except for aroona-glu-a3d, these nils possessed lmw-gs genes a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> , which were m-type pseudogenes with premature termination codons. the other genes were i-type genes. the a3- <dig> gene contained four allelic variants with unique snps and indels, i.e., a3-502- <dig>  a3-502- <dig>  a3-502- <dig> and a3-502- <dig>  all a3- <dig> allelic variants and the a3- <dig> gene were pseudogenes, containing premature termination codons in the coding sequences. the i-type genes, a3- <dig>  a3- <dig>  a3- <dig> and a3- <dig>  were the only active genes in aroona-glu-a3b, a3c, a3e and a3f, respectively. sequence alignments showed that a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> shared high identity  differing only in one indel and one snp, whereas a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> were greatly different from each other and the other i-type genes . a3- <dig> was much shorter than the other i-type proteins due to deletion of three repetitive units and several glutamine residues in repetitive regions, and lacking gtflqph in the c-terminal domain . aroona-glu-a3d contained six unique lmw-gs genes . for two m-type genes, a3- <dig> was a pseudogene, whereas a3- <dig> contained an intact coding sequence that could be expressed in the developing grain  <cit> . the other four genes, a3- <dig>  a3- <dig>  a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> were i-type genes, and among them a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> were active. both genes contained unique snps in the c-terminal domain and different lengths of repetitive region compared to other i-type genes . thus, compared to only one lmw-gs gene expressed in the other glu-a <dig> alleles, glu-a3d contained three active genes, one m-type  and two i-type  lmw-gs genes. except for a3- <dig>  the active genes at the glu-a <dig> locus were i-type genes. these i-type genes encoded b-group lmw-gs, producing different electrophoretic patterns in the b-group region among glu-a <dig> nils .

for glu-b <dig> alleles, 3– <dig> lmw-gs genes were identified in aroona  and seven glu-b <dig> nils. gene b3- <dig> was present in all aroona nils and four allelic variants  were identified . sequence alignment showed that the deduced protein sequences of the three b3- <dig> allelic variants differed in only four amino acids, whereas b3- <dig> contained a deletion in the repetitive domain and differed by seven amino acids from the b3- <dig> proteins . b3- <dig>  b3- <dig>  b3- <dig> and b3- <dig> were allelic variants, sharing over 99% of identity and their deduced protein sequences differed only in the repetitive domain with the deletion of glutamine residues or one repetitive unit . b3-621- <dig>  b3-621- <dig> and b3- <dig> genes were highly conserved and their proteins differed only in one indel of a glutamine residue in the repetitive domain and one amino acid at the c terminal region . the b3- <dig> gene was quite distinct, differing from b3- <dig> and b3- <dig> in several snps and indels . moreover, b3- <dig> varied among aroona-glu-b3c, b3d, b3h and b3i, and the protein products differed in seven amino acids and two indels . among glu-b <dig> genes, b3- <dig>  b3- <dig> and b3- <dig> were pseudogenes with premature termination codons, whereas the other genes contained intact orfs . sequence analysis showed that b3- <dig>  b3- <dig>  b3- <dig> and b3- <dig> were m-type genes and the others were s-type genes. based on the differences in s-type genes, glu-b <dig> nils were classified into two groups. aroona-glu-b3a, b3b, b3f and b3g contained b3- <dig>  b3-544/593/601/ <dig>  and b3-621/ <dig>  and the others had longer sequences of genes, b3- <dig> and b3-691/813/null . this classification was consistent with the different electrophoretic patterns contrasting the two groups .

aroona-glu-b3a, b3b, b3f and b3g had similar lmw-gs compositions, but each of them possessed unique allelic variants . both aroona-glu-b3f and b3g contained b3-530- <dig>  but they differed in b3- <dig>  b3- <dig>  b3-621- <dig> and b3-621- <dig> genes .aroona-glu-b3f and aroona  shared the same b3-621- <dig>  but possessed different genes b3-601/b3-530- <dig> and b3-607/b3-530- <dig>  respectively . on the other hand, aroona-glu-b3c, b3d, b3h, and b3i also differed in active genes and their allelic variants. aroona-glu-b3c and b3d contained b3-530- <dig>  but their b3- <dig> proteins differed in five amino acids . aroona-glu-b3i was unique, containing four active lmw-gs genes b3- <dig>  b3- <dig>  b3-688- <dig> and b3- <dig> . b3- <dig> was only present in glu-b3i, encoding an m-type lmw-gs with the n-terminal domain metsqipglekps. although b3-688- <dig> and b3- <dig> were different genes, they shared about 99% identity and b3- <dig> is formally reported for the first time.

at the glu-d <dig> locus, eight genes were identified from individual nils except aroona-glu-d3f . d3- <dig> and d3-583/586/ <dig> had premature termination codons. all the other genes were widely reported and were expressed in developing grains  <cit> . d3- <dig>  d3- <dig> and d3- <dig> were highly conversed among the aroona nils. d3- <dig> and d3- <dig> were allelic variants with over 99% identity, and differed in only two snps and two indels. allelic variants d3- <dig> and d3- <dig> were identical, except for one indel. two allelic variants, d3-578- <dig> and d3-578- <dig> differed by eight snps . compared with the active glu-d <dig> genes in aroona , d3- <dig> and d3-578- <dig> were present in aroona-glu-d3b and d3d, which possessed the same active lmw-gs genes . besides d3- <dig> and d3-578- <dig>  aroona-glu-d3a contained unique gene d3- <dig> in contrast to aroona. in aroona-glu-d3f, only four lmw-gs genes were identified; the other four genes might be absent due to deletion, substitution or other mutations .

each aroona nil possessed unique lmw-gs alleles. the gene compositions of these lmw-gs alleles were dissected, all the lmw-gs gene sequences were characterized, and the proteins sequences were deduced . based on the size of the deduced lmw-gs and the lmw-gs 2d-page spots identified from xiaoyan  <dig>  jing  <dig> and norin  <dig>  <cit> , lmw-gs genes were assigned to protein bands in sds-page gels . the active i-type genes at the glu-a <dig> locus, all the active genes at glu-b <dig> and the genes d3-525/ <dig>  d3- <dig> and d3- <dig> at glu-d <dig> encoded b-group lmw-gs, whereas the protein products of the other active genes belonged to the c-group. moreover, b3-621/ <dig>  b3-593/601/ <dig>  d3- <dig> and d3- <dig> encoded proteins with similar molecular weights , and ran synchronously on sds-page, forming the thickest protein bands in aroona-glu-b3a, b3b and b3f. b3- <dig> genes encoding the longest protein conferred the unique protein pattern on aroona-glub3d, b3h and b3i. .

comparison of whole proteins among lmw-gs nils using 2d-page
the data from sds-page and the lmw-gs marker system showed that each glu- <dig> allele contained several unique lmw-gs and gliadin genes. to analyze the composition of lmw-gs and gliadin proteins in individual nils, we performed 2d-page analysis of the whole flour proteins . in the previous studies, using 2d-page coupled with ms or n-terminal sequencing technology, lmw-gs proteins in xiaoyan  <dig>  jing  <dig>  norin  <dig> and butte  <dig> were successfully identified  <cit> . these data greatly contributed to the identification of flour proteins in the aroona nils.

among five glu-a <dig> nils, aroona-glu-a3b and aroona  shared the same protein patterns, except for one gliadin spot, which was in agreement with the similar composition of lmw-gs genes and the high identity between a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> . compared with aroona, aroona-glu-a3d contained three unique lmw-gs, a3- <dig>  a3- <dig> and a3- <dig>  and two gliadin spots were absent . for aroona-glu-a3e, the protein product of the unique i-type gene a3- <dig> was too little to be detected, but three unique gliadin spots were present in 2d-page . aroona-glu-a3f also contained one unique i-type protein  and one gliadin spot different from aroona . thus, accompanying the unique lmw-gss in individual glu-a <dig> nils, generally 1– <dig> gliadin spots were different among them. the only exception was aroona-glu-a3e which possessed the highest number of gliadins and the lowest quantity  of i-type lmw-gs among the glu-a <dig> nils .

among eight glu-b <dig> nils, aroona-glu-b3c, b3d, b3h and b3i shared similar protein spot patterns on 2d-page, consistent with their similar electrophoretic patterns on sds-page . compared with the protein spot pattern of aroona , aroona-glu-b3c, b3d, b3h and b3i contain the unique b3- <dig> proteins . the b3- <dig> protein spot in aroona-glu-b3c was much weaker than those in the other three nils . except for lmw-gs proteins, only one or two small gliadin spot differences were identified among the four nils . the other three aroona nils  had similar protein spot patterns with aroona . among these four nils, a unique lmw-gs protein b3- <dig> was detected in aroona-glu-b3g, whereas the other three alleles shared the same lmw-gs protein spot patterns . thus, the 2d-page patterns of aroona and seven glu-b <dig> nils suggested that their different proteins mainly were unique lmw-gs proteins rather than gliadins.

for the glu-d <dig> nils, the protein spots encoded by the d3- <dig> gene in aroona-glu-d3a, d3b and d3d had larger molecular weights and pis than its allelic variant d3- <dig> in aroona . no other different lmw-gs spots were detected among these glu-d <dig> nils, and aroona-glu-d3a and d3d, each contained only one unique gliadin spot . the aroona-glu-d3f allele was unique, lacking two lmw-gs proteins  and at least three medium gliadin spots . the absence of four lmw-gs genes was also observed using the lmw-gs gene marker system . thus, except for aroona-glu-d3f, only one or two different protein spots were detected among glu-d <dig> nils, and the proteins encoded by genes at the glu-d <dig> locus were highly conserved.

quality properties of the lmw-gs nils
dough properties such as zeleny-sedimentation value , farinograph and extensograph parameters, gmp parameters, and pan bread quality parameters, were measured on the aroona nils . the  <dig> genotypes showed significant differences  in most quality parameters, suggesting that genotype had an important influence on variation in wheat quality properties . significant differences in some parameters  were also observed between the two locations . however, no significant interaction effects between genotypes and locations were detected for most quality parameters, except for external color of bread and farinograph development time . analysis of variance  and multiple comparisons of all quality parameters were performed among all nils within each glu- <dig> group .

* significant at p <  <dig> ; ** significant at p <  <dig> .

a lv: loaf volume , lvs: loaf volume score, ec: external color, sha: shape, ic: inner color, smo: smoothness, spr: springiness, str: structure, tf: taste flavor, pbts: pan bread total score, kp: kernel protein , zsv: zeleny sedimentation value , st: farinograph stability time , dt: farinograph development time , wab: farinograph water absorption , rmax: extensograph maximum resistance , ea: energy area , ext: extensograph extensibility , epp: extractable glutenin polymeric protein; upp: unextractable glutenin polymeric protein; gli/glu: ratio of gliadin to glutenin; %upp = upp/ ×  <dig> 

anova showed that the glu-a <dig> nils were significantly different in most quality parameters . this suggested that glu-a <dig> alleles affected the bread-making quality of bread wheat. subsequent multiple comparisons indicated that aroona-glu-a3e always produced the worst quality parameters, e.g., zsv, farinograph stability time , extensograph maximum resistance , extensograph extensibility , percentage of sds-unextractable fraction in total polymeric protein , and pan bread total score , whereas the other five glu-a <dig> nils had similar values for rmax, st, %upp and ext . although aroona-glu-a3d had the largest zsv, it showed only moderate pbts .

glu-b <dig> nils showed large differences in the most important quality parameters , indicating that glu-b <dig> alleles were also significantly associated with bread-making quality. among eight glu-b <dig> nils, aroona-glu-b3g produced the highest pbts, zsv, st, rmax, %upp and some other parameters . similarly, aroona  and aroona-glu-b3i had higher quality parameters than the other glu-b <dig> nils, excluding aroona-glu-b3g. in contrast, aroona-glu-b3c performed the lowest in zsv, st, rmax, %upp, pbts, and some other parameters , suggesting that glu-b3c was an undesirable allele for bread-making quality. the other glu-b <dig> nils  possessed similar moderate quality parameters, without significant differences.

five glu-d <dig> nils produced similar quality parameters, without significant differences, except for farinograph water absorption and the ratio of gliadin to glutenin . this was consistent with the similar composition of lmw-gs genes and proteins among glu-d <dig> nils.

discussion
in the present study, sds-page, 2d-page and lmw-gs gene molecular marker system were used for characterization of lmw-gs genes and proteins in  <dig> aroona nils. each nil contained a unique lmw-gs allele. the genetic and protein compositions of each lmw-gs allele were dissected. in addition, we analyzed the functional differences among the lmw-gs alleles in bread-making quality using these nils. the molecular mechanisms behind the functional differences were discussed based on the characterization of lmw-gs genes and proteins in the nils.

characterization of lmw-gs genes and proteins in the nils
sds-page is a useful method to accurately identify hmw-gs in bread wheat, but is inefficient for separating lmw-gs alleles, because of the presence of large numbers of lmw-gs proteins with similar mobilities with each other and with gliadins . in the present study, the lmw-gs gene marker system was successfully used to separate 14– <dig> lmw-gs from each nil, and also distinguished  <dig> glu- <dig> nils, except for aroona-glu-b3c and b3d without the length polymorphisms among b3-688- <dig> and b3-688- <dig> . these results indicated that the lmw-gs gene marker system was efficient and accurate not only in separating members of the lmw-gs gene family  <cit> , but also in distinguishing allelic variants of individual lmw-gs genes. recently, allele-specific markers were widely used in distinguishing glu-a <dig> and glu-b <dig> alleles  <cit> . however, the high conservation among glu-d <dig> allelic variants made it difficult to develop allele-specific markers for discriminating different allelic variants. because these allelic variants showed dna sequence polymorphisms in length, the lmw-gs gene marker system worked well in dissecting the complex genes and allelic variants at the glu-d <dig> locus . on the other hand, compared with only one gene in individual alleles identified with gene-specific primers  <cit> , almost all the genes in glu- <dig> alleles were displayed using the lmw-gs gene marker system . identification of all genes in each allele will greatly contribute to an understanding of the molecular mechanism determining functional differences among glu- <dig> alleles in bread wheat.

in the present study, aroona and its nils contained most of the glu- <dig> allelic variations identified from the worldwide wheat germplasm in a cooperative program  <cit> . each lmw-gs allele was encoded by several linked genes or haplotypes  <cit> . the dissection of lmw-gs genes in aroona nils would facilitate the haplotype analysis of lmw-gs genes in common wheat. at the glu-a <dig> locus, besides two m-type genes, 2– <dig> i-type genes were identified from individual glu-a <dig> alleles. unlike the conserved m-type genes, i-type genes were completely different among five alleles. these i-type genes might be tightly linked, forming unique haplotype in each glu-a <dig> allele, e.g. a3-484/a3-565/a3-568/a3- <dig> in glu-a3d   <cit> . at the glu-b <dig> locus, 1–2 m-type gene and 1–3 s-type gene were characterized in individual alleles. generally, these s-type genes could be divided into two groups, one containing b3-578/b3-544/593/601/607/b3-621/ <dig>  the other having b3-688/b3-691/813/n . these s-type genes in each group might cosegregate and form unique haplotypes in bread wheat  <cit> . among four allelic variants of m-type gene b3- <dig>  b3-530- <dig> was present in both aroona  and aroona-glu-b3h, containing difference s-type haplotypes b3-578/b3-607/b3-621- <dig> and b3-688/b3- <dig>  respectively. thus, at the glu-b <dig> locus, the m- and s-type genes appeared not to be tightly linked   <cit> . all the glu-d <dig> alleles except glu-d3f contained eight lmw-gs genes . only one or two allelic variants . lmw-gs proteins shared some similar characteristics, such as mostly located in the b-group region and larger pis than gliadins. although it is difficult to detect small variation in molecular weight and quantity of each protein spot in 2d-page, the composition and allelic variations of seed storage proteins for each glu- <dig> allele were successfully characterized. these results were in agreement with the 2d protein patterns of xiaoyan  <dig>  jing  <dig>  norin  <dig>  butte  <dig> and some other varieties identified with lc-ms or n-terminal sequencing  <cit> . for example, the glu-a3d and glu-b3d alleles showed similar electrophoretic patterns to xiaoyan  <dig> and norin  <dig> in i-type  and s-type  proteins, respectively  <cit> , and glu-b3g shared the same spot pattern of b3- <dig> with glenlea  <cit> . moreover, comparison of 2d-page patterns showed that, except for the different lmw-gs proteins, only 1– <dig> unique small gliadin spots were present in individual aroona nils . these results suggested that the differences among the aroona nils were mainly derived from allelic variation of lmw-gs genes.

lmw-gs alleles and bread-making quality
the nil population was used to study the effects of lmw-gs on dough properties, gmp parameters, and pan bread quality parameters. the results confirmed that the lmw-gs played important roles in determining variation in wheat quality properties. among the three glu- <dig> loci, alleles glu-a <dig> and glu-b <dig> were of major importance in determining differences in processing qualities among the nils .

glu-a <dig> alleles
among five glu-a <dig> alleles, glu-a3e  performed the poorest in almost all quality properties . this was consistent with previous reports in which glu-a3e was associated with lower extensibility and rmax than glu-a3d, a3b and a3c <cit> . the negative effect of glu-a3e on dough rheological properties was reported in several studies previously  <cit> . no unique i-type protein band was detected from the glu-a3e allele using sds-page   <cit> . the protein product of the a3- <dig> gene was also not identified in 2d-page although the i-type gene a3- <dig> in aroona-glu-a3e contained the intact orf . less i-type proteins and more gliadins in glu-a3e increased the ratio of gliadin to glutenin and greatly reduced %upp , resulting in the worst performance of the glu-a3e genotype in dough resistance and extensibility and pan bread total score  <cit> . the other glu-a <dig> nils produced similar quality parameters, including rmax, st, ext and %upp. these data indicated that glu-a3a, a3c, a3d and a3f all had equivalent positive effects on upp content and dough resistance and extensibility . among them, glu-a3d had a significant effect on high zsv, which was consistent with results from xiaoyan  <dig> and jing  <dig> rils  <cit> . some other studies also reported that the glu-a3d allele had a superior effect on dough strength  <cit> . compared with only one active gene at the glu-a <dig> locus in the other alleles, the glu-a3d allele possessed three active lmw-gs genes and produced the highest zsv, rmax, and %upp . the large number of active genes in glu-a3d might be the basis of the superior performance in wheat quality properties  <cit> .

glu-b <dig> alleles
our study confirmed the important contribution of the glu-b <dig> locus to quality variation of bread wheat varieties. among eight glu-b <dig> alleles, glu-b3c  produced the lowest quality parameters, including zsv, st, rmax, %upp, and pbts . the inferior effects of glu-b3c allele were also reported in previous studies  <cit> . glu-b3c and glu-b3d  shared an identical lmw-gs composition, except for five amino acid differences between b3-688- <dig> and b3-688- <dig> , but produced significantly different rmax and zsv . b3-688- <dig> appeared to produce better quality properties than b3-688- <dig>  on the other hand, glu-b3c and glu-b3h  also contained similar active lmw-gs genes and had only a few snps in the b3- <dig> and b3- <dig> allelic variants, but glu-b3h had significantly more positive effects on pbts and zsv than glu-b3c . the 2d-page showed that glu-b3c had a smaller quantity of b3-688- <dig> protein than glu-b3d and b3h . this suggested that the unique snps in b3-688- <dig> might result in lower expression or difficulty in translation and polymerization. the small amount of b3-688- <dig> might directly cause the higher ratio of gliadin to glutenin and the lower %upp for the glu-b3c allele, finally resulting in its inferior effects on wheat quality . compared to two active genes in the three glu-b <dig> alleles above, glu-b3i contained four active genes, m-type haplotype b3-510/b3- <dig> and s-type haplotype b3-688/b3- <dig>  both haplotypes provided the highest number of active genes and lead to the best quality performance among the four alleles  <cit> .

the glu-b3a, b3b, b3f and b3g alleles belonged to the same group of s-type haplotypes. they shared similar electrophoretic patterns and each possessed three active lmw-gs genes, but had significantly different effects on quality properties . glu-b3g  produced the best quality parameters, including zsv, rmax, st, %upp, lv and pbts , in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . glu-b3b  also had positive effects on most quality parameters , again consistent with the previous studies  <cit> . the se-hplc parameters indicated that the low content of gliadin and the high content of upp might be the main reasons for the superior performance of glu-b3b and b3g . and the high content of upp might be derived from the snps or indels in the nucleotide sequences of three active genes , which enhanced the ability of the protein products to form large glutenin macropolymers. more evidence was obtained by comparing glu-b3f and glu-b3g. both alleles contained the same m-type gene, b3-530- <dig>  but had different s-type haplotypes and significant differences in zsv, st, upp, and pbts. the s-type haplotype b3-578/b3-544/b3-621- <dig> formed more upp and produced better bread-making quality than b3-578/b3-601/b3-621- <dig> 

glu-d <dig> alleles
the five glu-d <dig> alleles produced similar values for almost all quality properties in the present study , which confirmed previous reports that glu-d <dig> alleles produced similar rmax and extensibilities among large collections of wheat varieties  <cit> , although some studies indicated different effects of glu-d <dig> alleles on dough strength or mixing properties  <cit> . glu-d3a, d3b, d3c and d3d contained similar 2d-page spot patterns, and all six active genes were highly conserved among the alleles . their similarity in lmw-gs genes and whole proteins was consistent with their equivalent effects on all quality properties. although glu-d3f allele lacks two lmw-gs proteins and three gliadin spots, it produced similar quality properties to the other glu-d <dig> alleles . these results suggested that d3- <dig>  d3- <dig> and the three missing gliadins were not related to quality improvement. however, the lack of active genes d3- <dig> and d3- <dig> at the glu-d <dig> locus in jing  <dig>  showed significant negative effects on zsv  <cit> . thus, except for glu-d3l, glu-d <dig> alleles appeared to play only minor roles in determining quality variation among bread wheat varieties, and they should be given the lowest priority among lmw-gs alleles in selecting for improved bread-making quality in wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we dissected the genetic and protein composition of  <dig> lmw-gs nils, measured the dough property and bread-making quality properties of individual nils, and performed functional analyses for each allele. among five glu-a <dig> alleles, glu-a3e  was inferior with negative effects on all quality properties. among eight glu-b <dig> alleles, glu-b3b , glu-b3g  and glu-b3i  were correlated with superior bread-making quality, whereas glu-b3c  produced inferior quality properties. among five glu-d <dig> alleles, there were no significant differences in all quality parameters measured in the present study. moreover, all alleles with superior dough properties and pan bread quality also possessed high contents of upp and %upp. thus, it is possible that lmw-gs alleles determine dough viscoelasticity by modifying the size distribution of glutenin polymers and aggregative properties of glutenins  <cit> . these results significantly enhance our understanding of the composition of lmw-gs, confirm the strong effects of lmw-gs on not only dough extensibility but dough strength, and provide useful information for quality improvement in bread wheat.
