BACKGROUND
together with technology developments on large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism  genotyping  <cit> , there have been a number of genome-wide association studies  to identify candidate susceptibility or resistance genetic factors for multifactorial diseases  <cit> . it is estimated that eleven million snps with a greater than 1% minor allele frequency  are located in the human genome  <cit> . over six million snps have been uploaded on public snp databases through the human genome project and international snp discovery projects. among these snps, over  <dig> k snps across the human genome are selected with an average maf of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the hapmap caucasians, asians and africans, respectively, and can be simultaneously genotyped using affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig>  platform  <cit> . several studies have evaluated the coverage of commercial platforms using hapmap population data and genotype data of non-reference caucasian populations  <cit> . results from these studies indicated that in a non-reference caucasian population, as well as the hapmap populations, commercial snp typing platforms offered similar levels of genome coverage. however, the number of genotyped japanese individuals in the hapmap project was only  <dig> samples, which may lead to inaccurate estimation of the number of snps with low maf in the japanese population.

the snp array  <dig>  platform offers the genotype calling algorithm "birdseed" to determine the genotypes of  <dig>  snps  <cit> . the birdseed algorithm performs a multiple-chip analysis to estimate signal intensity for each allele of each snp, fitting probe-specific effects to increase precision, and then makes genotype calls by fitting a gaussian mixture model in the two-dimensional a-signal vs. b-signal space, using snp-specific models to improve accuracy. there was a report that 45% of snps observed to be significantly associated with the disease did not agree with hardy-weinberg equilibrium  using the previous version of mapping  <dig> k array set  <cit> . some of the miss-called snps would be induced by genotype calling algorithms and are likely to be ranked as significantly associated with the disease . therefore, there are strong demands for accurate genotype calls using the birdseed algorithm.

the snp array  <dig>  platform has three check points prior to hybridization on genechip arrays in order to exclude experimental errors; pcr amplicon size check by electropherograms, dnase i digested fragment size check by electropherograms and quantity check of the purified pcr products. the platform also includes quality control  probes for  <dig>  snps to assess the overall quality for a sample based on the dynamic model  algorithm. there are assay criteria to exclude experimental errors and low-quality samples; however, we empirically know that some samples, which pass these criteria, have low-quality genotyping results.

in this study, we genotyped  <dig> non-hapmap japanese samples using the snp array  <dig>  platform in order to evaluate the number of snps available for gwas in the japanese population, to examine an appropriate approach for acquiring accurate genotype calls using the birdseed genotype calling algorithm, and to evaluate the assay criteria for preventing low-quality genotyping data.

RESULTS
genotyping  <dig> japanese samples using snp array  <dig>  platform
we collected  <dig> sets of  <dig> japanese samples for genotyping using the snp array  <dig>  platform. the average concentration of genomic dna for the 1st set of  <dig> samples was  <dig>  ng/μl and that for the 2nd set of  <dig> samples was  <dig>  ng/μl. one of the critical points for the snp array  <dig>  platform to acquire high quality genotyping data is to prepare a uniform quantity of  <dig> ng genomic dna for nsp i and sty i digestion steps. when an almost 10-fold excess amount of genomic dna was used, the average overall call rate drastically decreased to about 80% for both nsp i and sty i digestion steps with the mapping  <dig> k array .

the average concentration of purified pcr products for the two sets of  <dig> samples was  <dig>  ng/μl  and  <dig>  ng/μl , respectively . in total,  <dig> samples  showed low qc call rates below the default 86% qc criteria . the genotype calls of  <dig>   <dig> snps for each individual were determined using the birdseed genotype calling algorithm, embedded in the affymetrix genotyping console  <dig>  software . the  <dig> samples of the 1st set that were over 86% qc criteria were used to assign genotypes and had an average overall call rate of  <dig> %, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . for the 2nd set,  <dig> samples were over 86% qc criteria and the average overall call rate was  <dig> %, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . when genotype calls were determined for every  <dig> samples analyzed simultaneously in the same batch, the average overall call rate was improved to  <dig> %  for the 1st set, and  <dig> %  for the 2nd set .

assay criteria for experimental errors occurring on running batches
the snp array  <dig>  platform has three check points prior to hybridization on genechip arrays in order to remove samples with experimental errors. however, some samples that pass these check points still have relatively low-quality genotyping results with lower overall call rates than 97%;  <dig> sample for the 1st set of  <dig> samples and  <dig> samples for the 2nd set of  <dig> samples. when genotype calls were determined for every  <dig> samples simultaneously analyzed in the same batch, the average overall call rate of  <dig> samples for batch # <dig> from the 2nd set was  <dig> %, which was almost 2% lower than other batches . the concentration of purified pcr products from batch # <dig> drastically fluctuated among the  <dig> samples . the cv  of the purified pcr product concentration for batch # <dig> was much higher than that for any other batches from the two sets of  <dig> samples . the cv of the purified pcr product concentration is a new indicator to assess experimental quality for each of the running batches, and may remove the experimental errors occurring on the running batches prior to hybridization on the genechip arrays.

for the  <dig> samples from batch # <dig> of the 2nd set, the intact genomic dna could not be detected clearly when the samples were electrophoresed on  <dig> % agarose gels . therefore, these genomic dnas for batch # <dig> of the 2nd set may have degraded due to repetitive freezing and thawing, which led to low-quality genotyping results. preparation of the exact amount of intact genomic dna is considered to be one of the crucial points for the snp array  <dig>  platform.

in order to assess the performance of the snp array  <dig>  platform and the birdseed algorithm, we mainly used genotyping data obtained from the 1st set of  <dig> samples because the 2nd set contained samples in poor condition.

genotype calling accuracy with "birdseed" algorithm
the genotype calling accuracy of the birdseed algorithm was considered to be improved as the sample number for determining genotype calls increased. we determined  <dig>  genotype calls for  <dig> samples among  <dig> samples with over 86% qc criteria, and used these genotype calls as a reference. we also determined the genotype calls of the same  <dig> samples under  <dig> different sample sizes, using  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples and  <dig> samples. to investigate the genotype calling accuracy of the birdseed algorithm, we compared the genotype calls determined under  <dig> different sample sizes to the reference genotype calls for each of the  <dig> samples. we prepared  <dig> sets of  <dig> samples from a batch of  <dig> samples  and performed the genotype call comparison for each set of  <dig> samples. figure  <dig> shows the average overall call rate and the average concordance rate for each set of the  <dig> samples. the average overall call rate for  <dig> sets of the  <dig> samples, which were determined with  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples and  <dig> samples, were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the average concordance rate for the  <dig> sets of the  <dig> samples under  <dig> different sample sizes were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. here, "no calls" was excluded from the concordance calculation.

our results showed that the average overall call rate of the  <dig> samples was almost constant when the genotype calls were determined with fewer than  <dig> samples; however, it gradually decreased as the sample number increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  which showed a negative correlation with a p value of  <dig> . in contrast, the concordance rate gradually increased as the sample number increased, which showed a positive correlation with a p value of  <dig> .

removing low-quality samples by adjusting qc criteria
our results showed that the average overall call rate gradually decreased as the sample number increased, presumably due to low-quality samples included in the genotype calling with the birdseed algorithm. indeed, there was one sample which had an overall call rate lower than 97% among the  <dig> samples with over 86% qc call rate. therefore, we applied more stringent qc criteria to remove the low-quality samples, because a linear relationship was observed between qc call rate and overall call rate . when we applied 95% qc criteria,  <dig> samples passed the qc criteria and the average overall call rate improved from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. by comparing the overall call rate determined under the 95% qc criteria with that under the default criteria,  <dig> of  <dig> samples improved by an average of  <dig> % in overall call rate; however, the remaining two samples showed decreased overall call rate  . these two samples were considered as outliers on the genotype calling with the birdseed algorithm and had to be removed. we repeated the removal of samples until none had a lower overall call rate than that determined under the default criteria. a total of  <dig> samples had an overall call rate that improved over the one determined under the default criteria, with an average change of  <dig> %. the average overall call rate for the  <dig> samples was  <dig> %, which was  <dig> % higher than the default qc criteria .

number of snps available for gwas in the japanese population
the genotype calls of  <dig>  snps were determined with  <dig> samples after sample filtering with adjusted qc criteria. however, these genotype calls still included inaccurate snps, which could lead to inflation of false positives, presumably due to systematically miss-called snps. therefore, snp filtering was considered to be important for a reliable and accurate set of genotype calls that avoid false association signals and false negative signals, allowing rapid identification of disease susceptibility genetic factors. we reported that the poorly behaving snps were effectively eliminated with the snp filtering parameters; maf > 5% or 1%, hwe p-value >  <dig>  and snp call rate > 95%  <cit> . here, snp call rate was defined for each snp as the number of successfully genotyped samples divided by the number of total samples genotyped.

among a total of  <dig>  snps genotyped using  <dig> samples,  <dig>  snps passed the three snp filtering criteria with maf > 5%, hwe p-value >  <dig>  and snp call rate > 95%, while  <dig>  snps passed with maf > 1%, hwe p-value >  <dig> , and snp call rate > 95%. a total of  <dig>  snps were observed to be monomorphic in the japanese population.

discussion
the emerging snp typing technologies have enabled genome-wide association studies to be conducted with hundreds of thousands of genotyped snps. according to affymetrix, the snp array  <dig>  platform can genotype over  <dig> k snp markers across the human genome with an overall call rate of at least 97%, over  <dig> % concordant with the hapmap genotypes, and the mendelian inheritance consistency for  <dig> trios of greater than  <dig> % when performing analysis under the default 86% qc criteria. to evaluate the snp  <dig>  array platform and the birdseed genotype calling algorithm, we genotyped two sets of  <dig> non-hapmap japanese samples using the snp array  <dig>  platform.

when we applied the default 86% qc criteria,  <dig> samples out of the 1st set of  <dig> samples were excluded and the average overall call rate was  <dig> %. there was one sample with an overall call rate of lower than 97% among the  <dig> samples. here, we found a linear relationship between qc call rate and overall call rate. therefore, we applied stringent qc criteria of over 95% in order to remove the low-quality samples and found that the average overall call rate for  <dig> samples passing the stringent qc criteria improved to  <dig> %. among the  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples had higher overall call rates than those determined under the default qc criteria; however, the remaining two samples showed lower overall call rates . when we repeated the removal of samples until none had a lower overall call rate than the one determined under the default criteria, none of the remaining  <dig> samples with an overall call rate lower than 97%. the average overall call rate of  <dig> samples was thus improved to  <dig> %. the decay of average overall call rate may be caused by some samples that pass the qc criteria, but still have a low overall call rate. we can thus improve overall call rate by removing these samples and adjusting the qc criteria.

one of the crucial points for the snp array  <dig>  platform is to prepare the exact amount of intact genomic dna. a 10-fold excess amount of genomic dna decreased the overall call rate of each sample to by about 80% and another study revealed that samples with less than  <dig> ng/μl genomic dna show low overall call rates  <cit> . therefore, we checked the concentration and condition of genomic dna with the nanodrop quatitation and agarose gel electrophoresis. the snp array  <dig>  platform has three check points to assess experimental errors prior to hybridization on genechip arrays. here, we found that the cv of the purified pcr product concentration was another critical indicator prior to hybridization in assessing the performance of each running batches. we suggest that samples with a cv value over  <dig>  are excluded from the remainder of the assay.

the genotype calling accuracy of the birdseed algorithm was assessed by comparing the  <dig>  genotype calls of  <dig> samples from among <dig> samples with over 86% qc criteria, to those of  <dig> samples determined with six different sample sizes;  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples,  <dig> samples and  <dig> samples. the concordance rate gradually increased as the number of samples increased. the average concordance rate was almost constant over  <dig> %, when the genotype calls were determined with over  <dig> samples using the birdseed algorithm. however, the average overall call rate of the  <dig> samples gradually decreased as the sample number increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  we could explain the reasons why the overall call rate decreases, and why the concordance rate increases for these  <dig> samples in a grouping of samples greater than  <dig> by means of characteristic properties of the birdseed algorithm and minor allele frequency of each snp. when the sample number was smaller than  <dig>  all of three clusters designating aa, ab and bb genotypes were rarely observed for the snps with low maf. in such cases, the birdseed algorithm would determine the genotype as a single cluster, however, would ambiguously genotype as aa, bb and ab . therefore, high call rate and low concordance were observed with the sample number smaller than  <dig>  in contrast, when the sample number was greater than  <dig>  two or three clusters would be observed for many snps. for these snps, the birdseed algorithm could determine the outlying samples from each cluster as "no calls", leading to low call rate and high concordance.

we can accurately determine the genotype calls with high overall call rates by determining the genotype calls with more than  <dig> samples, after removing low-quality samples by adjusting the qc criteria. our results showed that the snp array  <dig>  platform reached the expected level reported by the manufacturer, with an average overall call rate of over  <dig> % and an average concordance rate of over  <dig> %. however, about 20% of a total of  <dig>  snps were found to be monomorphic in the japanese population, which is due to snp selection methods. the snps assayed on the snp array  <dig>  platform were mainly selected as observed with high maf in the caucasian population. among a total of  <dig>  snps genotyped using the snp array  <dig>  platform with  <dig> japanese samples,  <dig>  snps passed three snp filtering criteria; maf > 5%, hwe p-value >  <dig>  and snp call rate > 95%. although the exact number of snps within the human genome remains under discussion, it has been reported that the genome coverage of the jpt + chb population in the phase ii hapmap data was 66% using the mapping  <dig> k array set  <cit> . the genome coverage of the snp array  <dig>  platform was estimated using the same calculation and was revealed to be 75% with the  <dig>  snps in the japanese population.

CONCLUSIONS
the current affymetrix snp array  <dig>  platform enables the genotyping of over  <dig> k snps with high overall call rate  and high concordance rate . the number of snps available for gwas in the japanese population was revealed to be over  <dig> k snps, all of which passed the three snp filtering criteria; maf > 1%, hwe p-value >  <dig>  and snp call rate > 95%. gwas using the snp array  <dig>  platform has considerable potential in identifying candidate susceptibility or resistance genetic loci for multifactorial diseases in the japanese population, as well as in other populations.

finally, the genotyping data of  <dig> japanese samples using the snp array  <dig>  platform will be deposited in a public database to share with the research community  <cit> .
