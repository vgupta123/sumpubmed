BACKGROUND
over the last decade, many plant pathogen resistance  genes or quantitative trait loci  have been cloned. the largest class of known r genes encodes proteins with a central nucleotide binding  domain and a c-terminal leucine-rich repeat  domain  <cit> . based on the amino-terminal domain feature, the nb-lrr proteins can be divided into two classes: tnl  and cnl  in which the r proteins possess, respectively, either the toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain or a coiled-coil  domain  <cit> . the nb domain seems to have ntp-hydrolyzing activity for regulating signal transduction through conformational changes  <cit> . the lrr domain contains tandemly arrayed repeats that is involved in the specific recognition of pathogen effectors  <cit> . both tir and cc domains are assumed to be involved in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction  <cit> .

due to the availability of whole genome sequences, nb-encoding resistance gene homolog  sequences have been annotated and mapped in a number of plant species such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , poplar   <cit> , potato   <cit> , rice   <cit> , sorghum   <cit> , grapevine   <cit> , coffee tree   <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , and papaya   <cit> . while nb-lrr genes are widely distributed among plant genomes, their numbers vary greatly in different species. for example, the papaya and grapevine genome contains  <dig> and  <dig> nb-lrr rghs representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their total genes, respectively  <cit> . a lack of recent genome duplication was believed to be the reason of the overall low nb-lrr gene numbers in papaya  <cit> . nb-encoding genes are unevenly distributed in the plant genome and are mainly organized in multi-gene clusters. the clustered distribution of r-genes is assumed to provide a reservoir of genetic variations from which new pathogen specificity can evolve via gene duplication, unequal crossing-over, ectopic recombination or diversifying selection  <cit> . in addition, nucleotide polymorphism analyses demonstrated extremely high level of inter- and intra-specific variations of nb-lrr genes, which presumably evolve rapidly in response to changes in pathogen populations  <cit> . nevertheless, conservation of synteny for nb–lrr disease resistance genes among phylogenetically related species was also observed  <cit> . however, the extent of genome-wide conservation and synteny of nb-lrr rghs between different species is not well documented.

cucumber, cucumis sativus l.  is an economically important vegetable crop and a system of choice for studying several important biological processes  <cit> . in recent years, application of next generation sequencing technologies enabled release of draft genomes of three cucumber lines   <cit>  providing powerful tools for understanding the structure and organization of r genes in the cucumber genome. in the  <dig> draft genome,  <dig> nb-containing rghs were identified  <cit> , but no details were given for these rghs, and the rgh numbers seem to be underestimated as compared with an improved annotation of the  <dig> genome   <cit> . thus, one objective of the present study was to conduct genome wide identification and characterization of nb-lrr type rghs in the gy <dig> draft genome assembly   <cit> . since the ratio of genetic to physical distances varies along the chromosomes , the information of genetic map locations of rghs, especially on a high-density reference genetic map, is very useful for map-based cloning of r genes or association mapping through the candidate gene approach. the association of rghs with candidate disease resistance genes has been well established in a number of crops such as melon   <cit> , wheat   <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , sunflower   <cit> , and potato  <cit> . the information of genetic and physical locations of rghs also allows for quick map-based cloning of several r genes or qtl in rice  <cit> , poplar  <cit>  and common bean   <cit> .

cultivated cucumber has a very narrow genetic base  <cit>  making it difficult to develop high-density genetic maps. from whole genome sequences, tens of thousands of simple sequence repeat  markers have been developed  <cit> . among all ssr-based cucumber genetic maps constructed thus far  <cit> , the one by ren et al. <cit>  with  <dig> ssr loci has the highest marker density. however, this map was developed with a limited number of recombinant inbred lines  from an inter-subspecific cross between gy <dig> and the wild cucumber  accession pi  <dig> . strong recombination suppression was found in this mapping population, and more than one quarter of mapped loci were clustered across five chromosomes . as a result, the total genetic distance of this map is only  <dig>  cm, which is shorter than the expected ~750 cm map length for the cucumber genome  <cit> . the most recent intra-varietal linkage map of cultivated cucumber was developed with an f <dig> population of gy14 ×  <dig>  containing  <dig> marker loci with a total map length of  <dig>  cm, which allowed for integration of the genetic and physical maps to develop a chromosome-level draft genome assembly of gy <dig>   <cit> . while such maps are a significant improvement as compared with those aflp- or rapd-based maps developed early, marker density on this map is still far from being satisfactory for many molecular marker-based applications such as marker-assisted breeding, map-based gene cloning or assembly of a more complete cucumber genome.

for cultivated crops like cucumber with limited genetic diversity, development of a dense consensus map is a method of choice to increase marker density, which is usually achieved through map integration by synthesizing the information from multiple segregating populations of diverse genetic backgrounds. this allows for mapping a larger number of loci than in most single crosses to saturate the map, thus providing a genomic framework for qtl identification, map-based gene cloning, assessment of genetic diversity, association mapping, as well as marker-assisted selection in molecular breeding  <cit> . consensus maps have been constructed in a number of crop species such as lettuce   <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , cowpea   <cit> , red clover   <cit> , sorghum  <cit> , soybean   <cit> , melon  <cit> , and the oilseed rape, brassica napus <cit> . in cucumber, a consensus map with  <dig>  mapped loci was also developed by integrating the csh-ril map  and the s94 × s <dig> ril map  <cit> . a major drawback associated with this consensus map is that marker orders in the recombination suppressed regions were not well resolved, which greatly affect the accuracy of the order of loci and the quality of the resulting integrated cucumber map. thus, the second objective of the present study was to develop a high-density consensus map for cultivated cucumber by integrating several individual maps and to anchor all nb-lrr type rghs identified herein onto this integrated map.

we first scanned the gy <dig> draft genome and bioinformatically identified and characterized  <dig> nb-containing rgh sequences. in silico expression in cucumber transcriptome and conservation in sequence homology and colinearity between cucumber and melon genomes were investigated. through comparison between the gy <dig> and  <dig> draft genome sequences, we identified dna polymorphisms in the regions harbouring the rghs, and genetically mapped these rgh loci on the gy14 × 9930 f <dig> linkage map   <cit> . by integrating three component maps, we developed a cucumber consensus map that contained  <dig>  loci and anchored  <dig> rgh loci and  <dig> cucumber genes.

RESULTS
characterization of nb-containing r gene sequences in gy <dig> cucumber genome
seventy non-redundant nb-encoding rghs were identified in the cucumber gy <dig> draft genome. it seems all rghs presented in the cucumber genome as single copy because blast alignment against the gy <dig> draft genome assembly didn’t find any paralogs for each rgh sequence. the nucleotide and peptide sequences of all  <dig> rghs are provided in additional file  <dig>  based on the c- and n-terminal domain features, the  <dig> rghs could be classified into six subgroups  <cit> : n , cn , nl , tn , tnl , and cnl  with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> members in each category, respectively . the names, protein domain features, scaffold and gy <dig> draft genome positions, and chromosome locations of all  <dig> rghs are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the annotated nb-encoding rghs in the gy <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>  were largely consistent. as shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  only two rghs in the gy <dig> genome, cucsa. <dig> and cucsa. <dig>  were missing from the  <dig> genome; whereas each of the three rghs, csa5p <dig>  csa5p <dig>  and csa5p <dig> in the  <dig> genome was corresponding to two rghs in the gy <dig> suggesting different annotations of these sequences in the two genomes.

* numbers in parentheses were number of clusters.

we defined a rgh cluster as a genome dna region less than 1mbp that contained two or more rgh members. clustering of rghs in the cucumber genome was obvious. among the  <dig> rghs,  <dig>  were located in nine clusters, which were consistent with the gy <dig> scaffolds. characteristics of these clusters are summarized in table  <dig> and more details are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the two scaffolds, scaffold <dig> and scaffold <dig>  had the most rgh loci, which were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, whereas scaffold <dig> had the highest rgh density: ~  <dig> rghs per 100 kb genomic dna sequences . rgh members in some clusters seemed to be heterogeneous in the classes to which they belonged . that is, except for the cluster in scaffold <dig>  no other clusters contained rghs that were annotated in the same class. consistent with the clustering of rghs, their chromosomal distribution was clearly uneven. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> rghs in cucumber chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively .

b yes/no = there is  corresponding nb-lrr type rghs annotated in syntenic blocks of the melon genome. numbers in parentheses are number of rghs annotated in the corresponding cluster. melon annotation data were from garcia-mas et al.   <cit> . cucumber and melon chromosome synteny is based on li et al.   <cit> .

in silico analysis of rgh gene expression was conducted with blast against est contig assembly from  <dig> million illumina/ga reads from  <dig> tissues of cucumber inbred line  <dig>  <cit> , as well as  <dig>  million roche/ <dig> raw reads of the gy <dig> root and leaf tissues . the blast alignment result is summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig>  as compared with the gy <dig> leaf and root transcriptome, the  <dig> rna-seq dataset had more depth coverage of the cucumber transcriptome, and showed more blast hits with better query sequence coverage. thus, while  <dig> of the  <dig> nb-lrr sequences had hits in the gy <dig> leaf and root transcriptome, all of them seemed to have est representations in the  <dig> est data set. from the number of reads with blast hits of the gy <dig> leaf and root est collection , the expression level of different rghs varied significantly; tissue-specific expression of some rgh genes was also very clear.

the amino acid sequence of the nb domain  of each predicted nb resistance protein was extracted and used to perform a phylogenetic analysis. proteins with incomplete nb domains were excluded. the nb domain sequences of  <dig> nb rghs  were aligned and the resulting neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree is shown in figure  <dig>  two clades, cc-nb-lrr , and tir-nb-lrr  were evident, which contained  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. all cnl and cn class rghs were grouped into the cnl clade, and all tnl and tn rghs into the tnl clade. meanwhile, all n and nl type rghs were dispersed in the two groups .

homology and synteny of nb-lrr rgh sequences between the cucumber and melon genomes
the annotated melon draft genome has been released  <cit> . sequences of the  <dig> cucumber rghs identified herein were blast-aligned against the melon draft genome. information on chromosome locations and draft genome scaffold positions in cucumber and melon as well as alignment scores of these rghs is presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  of the  <dig> cucumber rgh sequences, two  had no blast hits in the melon draft genome, and four had low alignment scores . for the remaining  <dig> rgh sequences, each had a match sequence in the melon genome with a minimum 90% sequence identity and 90% sequence coverage of its whole length suggesting high degree of homology of these nb-lrr type rghs between the two genomes.

garcia-mas et al. <cit>  identified  <dig> nb-lrr type rghs in the melon draft genome,  <dig>  of which were in six clusters. the locations and classes of these rgh clusters in the cucumber and melon genomes were highly conserved. based on their scaffold positions and linkage map locations, five rgh clusters in the gy <dig> genome, scaffold00894 + scaffold <dig> , scaffold <dig> , scaffold <dig> , scaffold <dig> , and scaffold  <dig>   corresponded very well with the five rgh clusters in melon chromosomes v, iv, vii, ix, and i, respectively . the number and class of rghs in corresponding cucumber and melon clusters were largely consistent . meanwhile, the melon ortholog sequences of cucumber rghs in cucumber scaffold <dig> , scaffold <dig> , and part of scaffold <dig>  were not annotated as rghs in the melon genome . conversely, the only melon rgh cluster without its ortholog in cucumber was cluster # <dig>  located in cm <dig> _scaffold <dig> of melon chromosome ix  <cit> .

the syntenic relationships of cucumber and melon chromosomes have been largely established  <cit> . among the  <dig> rghs in cucumber with orthologs in the melon genome,  <dig> were located in syntenic blocks . we randomly selected six nb-lrr sequences from the melon genome  to verify their orthologous relationships in both cucumber and melon genomes by blast alignment, and all of them had single copy in the melon or the cucumber genome .

genetic mapping of rgh loci in cucumber
using 92 f <dig> plants of gy14 ×  <dig>  yang et al. <cit>  developed a high-density linkage map of cultivated cucumber with  <dig> marker loci . to anchor the  <dig> rghs identified herein onto this genetic map, markers for all rgh or rgh clusters were developed and used in linkage mapping of the rgh loci.

dna sequences of the  <dig> rghs between gy <dig> and  <dig>  were aligned to identify polymorphisms. eighteen rghs showed no polymorphisms . for these rghs, flanking markers were developed, with which  <dig> rghs were successfully anchored. three rghs, cucsa. <dig>  cucsa. <dig>  and cucsa. <dig>  failed to be anchored to the genetic map because the scaffolds in which they resided were relatively short and no polymorphic flanking markers were identified. for the remaining  <dig> rghs, single nucleotide, insertion/deletion  or ssr polymorphisms were identified. when possible, ssr markers were preferred to snps to tag these rghs. seventeen rghs had snp or indel polymorphisms within the target rgh sequence. snp-derived dcaps or indel-derived sts markers were developed as molecular tags for these  <dig> rghs without development of additional flanking markers . since a number of ssr markers on the gy14 × 9930 f <dig> high-density map  <cit>  were physically very close to many of these  <dig> rghs left, new markers were developed only for those rghs without close flanking markers. however, for a cluster with multiple rgh members, only markers flanking the cluster were developed. eventually  <dig> markers were employed to delimit and anchor  <dig> rghs, of which  <dig> were newly developed from the present study  and  <dig> were from yang et al.   <cit> . meanwhile, during the polymorphism screen stage of this study,  <dig> additional new markers  were developed but not used to delimit the rghs because these markers were less close to target rghs than other ones listed in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

for linkage analysis, genotypic data from the  <dig> new rgh markers for the 92 f <dig> plants of the css-f <dig> population were combined with the data of previously mapped  <dig> markers  <cit> . the resulting linkage map contained  <dig> loci in seven linkage groups. brief statistics of this map is presented in table  <dig> and graphically presented in figure  <dig>  in which  <dig> molecular marker loci delimiting  <dig> rghs were also highlighted. the genetic map and physical scaffold locations of all rghs were highly consistent  suggesting high reliability of the mapping data. the addition of  <dig> new markers slightly shortened the map length of this high-density genetic map by  <dig>  cm, and provided a road map for  <dig> nb-lrr rghs. details of all markers, their genetic and physical locations in the cucumber genome are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>

d the consensus map for chromosome  <dig> was integrated from two intra-varietal cucumber component genetic maps: the pi 249561 × pi 308915 f <dig> map   <cit>  and the gy14 × 9930 f <dig> map  .

e average genetic distance between adjacent markers  in centimorgan.

it is known that the ratios of genetic to physical distances varies significantly in different regions of the cucumber chromosomes . this was further evidenced in the rgh cluster regions in the present study. the genetic coverage  of each rgh cluster is presented in table  <dig>  which, when compared with respective physical span, clearly indicated very different recombination rate among these clusters. thus, this genetic mapping effort provided good approximation of genetic recombination in each cluster, which should be helpful in map-based cloning of r genes in cucumber.

consensus map construction
two steps were taken to integrate the intra-varietal css-f <dig>  , the css-ril   <cit>  maps, as well as the inter-subspecific csh-ril map   <cit> . first, common markers were identified and their orders were compared for each linkage group . the css-f <dig> map shared  <dig> and  <dig> markers with the css-ril and csh-ril maps, respectively . in selection of markers for bin mapping, chromosomal locations of three markers, ssr <dig>  ssr <dig> and ssr <dig> were inconsistent between the css-f <dig> and csh-ril maps. map locations of ssr <dig> did not agree between the css-f <dig> and the css-ril maps. the csh-ril and css-ril maps shared  <dig> markers with four  inconsistencies in chromosomal locations. based on the scaffolds with which these markers were associated and their map locations on different genetic maps, the chromosomal locations of ssr <dig>  ssr <dig>  ssr <dig>  and ssr <dig> on the css-f <dig> map, and ssr <dig>  ssr <dig>  as we all as cmct160a on the css-ril map were considered correct. details  of these and other markers  with discrepancies in chromosome locations among the component maps are summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

in total,  <dig> and  <dig> markers were selected from the csh-ril and css-f <dig> maps, respectively for bin mapping; all the  <dig> markers on the css-ril map were employed for map integration. to reduce the effects of marker clustering on map integration, markers in the four clusters in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of the csh-ril map were excluded from bin mapping.

the orders of shared markers among the three maps in respective linkage groups were quantitatively assessed with spearman’s rank correlation coefficients , and the result is shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the orders of common markers in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> between each pair of maps were strongly positively correlated . in contrast, marker orders in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed low correlations between the csh-ril and the other two maps, which was mainly due to the clustering of markers on the csh-ril map.

reliable map integration for chromosome  <dig> among the three component maps was difficult. on the csh-ril map,  <dig> loci were mapped in lg <dig>  but only covered  <dig>  cm due to recombination suppression and marker clustering  <cit> . only  <dig> markers were placed in lg <dig> on the css-ril map  <cit>  with a map length of  <dig>  cm. lg <dig> of the css-f <dig> map shared  <dig> and  <dig> markers with the above two maps, respectively. the consensus map of chromosome  <dig> integrated from the three individual maps shrank to  <dig>  cm and many markers were out of order when compared with their orders on individual maps and in the gy <dig> draft genome assembly . in addition, using the gy <dig> draft genome assembly   <cit>  as the reference, this map integration resulted in a large inversion in the distal region of chromosome  <dig> that could not be resolved. for these reasons, map integration for chromosome  <dig> was performed using the css-f <dig> map  and an intra-varietal f <dig> genetic map developed from pi 249561 × pi  <dig>   <cit> . all markers selected for bin mapping are indicated in additional file 2: table s <dig> .

the resulting consensus skeleton map contained  <dig> bins in seven linkage groups  . next, all the remaining markers including all molecular tags for  <dig> rghs on the component maps were assigned to the consensus bin map based on their original bin positions. for chromosome  <dig>  refilled markers included not only those residual markers from the css-f <dig> and css-pi-f <dig> maps, but also those from the csh-ril and css-ril maps. there were  <dig> markers with conflicting chromosome locations among the css-f <dig>  css-ril and csh-ril maps . based on the scaffolds with which these markers were associated, and the chromosome locations of other mapped markers from the same scaffold, the chromosome locations of these  <dig> markers on the css-f <dig> map constructed herein were considered correct and were assigned to the consensus map .

the final cucumber consensus map contained  <dig>  marker loci including markers delimiting  <dig> nb-lrr type rghs and ten gene loci, which is the densest genetic map of cucumber ever constructed. among the markers mapped,  <dig>  were developed from the cucumber genome, and  <dig> from melon. nearly all  of the mapped markers were co-dominant ssrs. the cucumber genes on this consensus map included bi for bitterfree, ccu for scab resistance, cp for compact plant growth habit, d for dull fruit skin, f for gynoecy, fr for fruit ribbing, h for heavy netting of mature fruit, m for bi-sexual flower, u for uniform immature fruit colour, and v- <dig> for virescent leaf  <cit> . details of this cucumber consensus genetic map are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  the total genetic length of this integrated map was 730 cm in seven linkage groups  with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. on average, there were  <dig> markers per chromosome, and chromosome  <dig> had the largest  number of markers. comparison of the marker orders between three component maps and the consensus map indicated high degree of accordance across all seven chromosomes as evidenced from the spearman’s rank correlation coefficient  of marker orders . the chromosome  <dig> consensus map was significantly improved in both marker numbers and map length as compared with the individual maps.

physically,  <dig> and  <dig> scaffolds of the gy <dig> and  <dig> draft genome assemblies were anchored onto the integrated map covering 95%  and 83%  of the two draft genome sequences, respectively . locations of all mapped loci on this consensus map in the gy <dig> draft genome assembly version  <dig>  are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  of the  <dig>  markers, only  <dig> did not have any in silico pcr product or blast hits in the gy <dig> and/or  <dig> draft genome scaffolds. the order of loci on the consensus linkage map was largely consistent with their physical locations in the gy <dig> draft genome assembly indicating that this integrated genetic map is highly reliable .

discussion
number and distribution of nb-lrr type rghs in the cucumber genome
we identified  <dig> nb-lrr type rghs in the gy <dig> draft genome . the number of nb-lrr type disease resistance genes in the cucumber genome was significantly lower than in species such as arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> , rice   <cit> , grapevine   <cit>  and potato   <cit> , but was simiar to that in papaya   <cit>  and melon   <cit> . the low number in papaya was believed to be due to lack of whole genome duplication  during evolution of its genome  <cit> . in the grapevine genome which didn’t undergo wgd either  <cit> , the recent expansion by tandem duplications was proposed to be the reason for the large numbers of nbs-encoding genes  <cit> . huang et al. <cit>  noticed that the lipoxygenase  gene family has been notably expanded in the cucumber genome and proposed that this might be a complementary mechanism to deal with biotic stresses. on the other hand, while the melon genome has small set of nb-lrr type rghs, the total number of resistance genes including the rlk , kin-gnk <dig> , rlp , pto-like or mlo-like rghs was not significantly fewer than arabidopsis or the grapevine  <cit> . therefore, the reason why cucurbit crops have fewer nb-lrr type resistance genes merits further investigation. nevertheless, these genetically mapped nb-lrr rghs from present study should be useful in map-based cloning or association mapping studies of disease resistance genes in the cucumber genome. for example, the single dominant scab  resistance gene, ccu, has been fine mapped  <cit>  which is co-localized with the large nb-lrr cluster  in the short arm of cucumber chromosome  <dig> .

expression studies of cloned r genes detected low levels of transcripts in unchallenged plants   <cit> . tan et al. <cit>  analyzed the expression patterns of ~ <dig> nb-lrr and related genes in arabidopsis, and found that most of these genes were expressed at low levels with a variety of tissue specificities. it is known that disease resistance is the predominant function for plant nb-lrr-encoding genes  <cit> , but their other biological roles should not be precluded. in this study, by examining the large collection of rna-seq data, we found est representations of all  <dig> rghs in the cucumber transcriptome; we also found that expression of a number of these genes was tissue-specific . these observations may suggest that all rghs identified herein might be expressed in the cucumber genome. however, further investigations are needed to understand the functions of these rghs and their tissue or organ specificities.

conservation of nb-lrr rghs in the cucumber and melon genomes
previous studies found that nb-lrr genes exhibited high level of inter- and intra-specific variation that presumably evolved rapidly in response to changes in pathogen populations  <cit> . sequence conservation and synteny was found in several nb-lrr genes among solanaceae species   <cit> . genome-wide comparison of nb-lrr-encoding genes between arabidopsis thaliana and a. lyrata found that both species have similar numbers of nb-lrr genes  <cit> . in the present study, of the  <dig> cucumber rghs,  <dig> had homologs and  <dig> were located in syntenic blocks of the melon genome . among the nine rgh clusters in cucumber, six were also annotated to encode nb-lrr type rghs in the melon genome, and all were located in syntenic blocks . however, in the syntenic regions of the six cucumber clusters with  <dig> rgh members, only  <dig> rghs were annotated in the melon genome . it seems that annotation of the melon genome need to be refined in these regions to resolve these discrepancies. nevertheless, it is clear that these rghs are highly conserved in the cucumber and melon genomes in both sequence homology and chromosome locations suggesting a similar evolution history of these rgh ortholog in the two species, which were diverged approximately ten million years ago  <cit> .

the high-density consensus map of cucumber
we presented herein an ssr-based integrated genetic map of cucumber that was constructed using the segregation data from three populations. the aim of this map was to fill the large gaps on each individual map with markers that have been mapped in other mapping experiments and resolve marker orders in the recombination suppression regions on the csh-ril map. the cucumber consensus map consisted of  <dig>  marker loci and the majority of these markers were anchored to the gy <dig> and/or  <dig> draft genome scaffolds . among linkage maps constructed so far in cucumber, this integrated map has the highest marker density. as compared with the css-f <dig> map , this consensus map significantly increased the number of marker loci , marker density , anchored gy <dig> draft genome sequences , as well as total map length  . similarly, this integrated map also showed several significant improvements over the cucumber consensus map by zhang et al. <cit>  in number of mapped loci , anchored genome sequences , and map length . the accuracy of marker orders on the present consensus map is also improved over the previous one  <cit> . this is especially true for markers in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which could be seen from comparisons of the marker order on the consensus map and in the gy <dig> draft genome assembly . considering the very narrow genetic base of cultivated cucumber, map integration has allowed us to place a larger number of markers than possible on any individual maps, thus obtaining a more complete coverage of the cucumber genome. this consensus map integrated with  <dig> nb-lrr rgh loci should have broad potential uses in molecular mapping, gene cloning, quantitative trait loci  analysis, marker-assisted selection, comparative genomics, as well as whole genome assembly studies.

CONCLUSIONS
cucumber contains relatively few nb-lrr type rghs that are clustered and unevenly distributed in the genome. as evidenced from their presence in the ests, all rghs seem to be transcribed. these nb-lrr type rghs shared significant homology in nucleotide sequences and high degree synteny in chromosomal location with the melon genome suggesting these rghs are highly conserved in genome organization and functions in the cucumis lineage. the high quality,  <dig> -locus consensus map is the densest genetic map of cucumber ever constructed. the rghs identified and characterized, and the high-density consensus genetic-physical map developed herein provide valuable genomics resources for many molecular marker-based studies such as mapping of quantitative trait loci, map-based gene cloning, assessment of genetic diversity, association mapping, as well as marker-assisted selection in molecular breeding in cucumber.
