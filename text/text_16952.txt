BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  strains are implicated in a large number of infections in humans and animals, such as urinary tract infection , meningitis, diverse intraabdominal infection, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and soft-tissue infection; besides, bacteremia can accompany infection at any of these sites. expec, which include avian pathogenic  e. coli, uropathogenic e. coli , septicemic e. coli, and newborn meningitis-causing e. coli , exhibit considerable genome diversity characterized by the possession of various combinations of adhesins , iron-acquisition systems , host defense-avoidance mechanisms , toxins , and others  which collectively are known as extraintestinal virulence factors  <cit> .

apec strains are responsible for avian colibacillosis in domesticated and wild birds, an illness which starts as a respiratory tract infection and evolves into a systemic infection of internal organs  <cit> . apec strains show similarities with human expec strains, but it is unclear whether the different expec strains are indistinctly associated with all such invasive diseases in human and animals or whether particular clones are associated with avian colibacillosis, urosepsis or meningitis. the diversity of known and putative expec-associated virulence genes, together with high levels of genetic overlap seen among both pathogenic and non-pathogenic extraintestinal e. coli isolates, makes it difficult to attribute a set of factors to a specific group of expec  <cit> . in fact, different authors have pointed out that there is no unique virulence profile for both upec and apec, emphasizing their potential to be zoonotic agents  <cit> .

among expec strains, the o <dig> serogroup is one of the most commonly detected in apec, upec, nmec and septicemic e. coli strains  <cit> . on the other hand, expec strains that cause neonatal meningitis  have been typically associated with the k <dig> capsular antigen  <cit>  and, in the same way, there has been shown a link between apec strains of serotypes o1:k <dig>  o2:k <dig>  o18:k <dig> with pathogenicity  <cit> . ewers et al.  <cit>  found in their study of  <dig> strains , a considerably high number of virulence genes associated with neuc -positive strains belonging to the three pathogroups.

in the present study, we performed comparative genotyping of apec, nmec and septicemic/upec isolates belonging exclusively to the proven pathogenic serotype o1:k1:h7/nm, obtained from four countries. the objective was to characterize their content of virulence genes, phylogenetic groups, mlst types and pfge macrorestriction profiles to better understand the similarities or differences of these expec pathotypes.

RESULTS
determination of the o:k:h antigens
all  <dig> isolates included in the present study belonged to the o1:h <dig> or hnm  serotype, with  <dig> nonmotile strains. curiously, 95%  strains belonging to phylogenetic group d showed to be nonmotile against 15%  b <dig> strains . when the isolates were tested by pcr  for the presence of the flagellar h <dig> gene, all but two strains  resulted positive. besides, all  <dig> isolates showed to possess the neuc gene that encodes the k <dig> capsular antigen.

phylogenetic typing
there are several studies suggesting that virulent clonal groups are derived primarily from phylogroup b <dig>  and to a lesser extent from phylogroup d, explaining the predominance of phylogenetic groups b <dig> and d among clinical isolates  <cit> . as expected, we found that the  <dig> expec strains o1:k1:h7/hnm included in this study belonged to the phylogenetic groups b <dig> and d , although significant differences on their association were detected: only one apec isolate of phylogroup d  against  <dig>  of human origin  .

phylogroup: b2
*apec plasmid-associated genes. two-way comparisons were performed for each gene and for the phylogroups, using fisher's exact test. apec isolates were compared to human expec, and septicemic/upec to nmec. **for each comparison, a p value of <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant , and a p value of >  <dig>  was not considered statistically significant .

in view of the present results, and due to the limited number of avian strains included in the study, we decided to analyze and extra group of  <dig> apec isolates o1:k1: . these new  <dig> apec isolates had been originated from different provinces throughout spain, from  <dig> to  <dig>  by phylogenetic typing, all of them showed to belong to the phylogroup b <dig>  confirming previous results.

virulence genotyping
it is difficult a detailed comparison of our results with others' as most studies published concerns more than one serogroup of expec and, consequently, data are not easily comparable. in a recent study, johnson et al.  <cit>  tested the hypothesis that some apec strains are a source of human upec. for this purpose and after assaying a big collection of more than  <dig>  apec and upec strains, the authors chose the apec o <dig>  from a mixed cluster with common characteristics  of both apec and upec strains. the authors did not found convincing genetic support for host- or syndrome-specific pathotypes within the broader expec group, based on the provided evidence that the genome sequence of the b <dig> apec o1:k1:h <dig> strain shares strong similarities with some human extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli genomes.

in our study, we have found, however, interesting differences. the content of virulence genes was determined by pcr  and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  and table  <dig> . apec isolates versus human expec showed statistically significant differences  in seven virulence markers , being fimavmt <dig> and sat associated with human isolates and, consequently, positively associated with phylogenetic group d; while papgii, tsh, iron, cvac and iss were associated with apec, resulting papgii, iron, cvac and iss positively associated with phylogroup b. so, among the six apec plasmid-associated genes  tested, four  were statistically associated with apec isolates. three genes  were exclusively detected in isolates of human origin, but only sat showed significant differences  with apec. the other virulence markers analyzed did not show statistical differences, either because they were not detected in any of the  <dig> isolates  or only in one strain , or because they were highly prevalent  .

genes showing statistical differences in relation to pathogenic groups were compared for the phylogenetic groups, using fisher's exact test. *for each comparison, a p value of <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant , and a p value of >  <dig>  was not considered statistically significant .

all the  <dig> isolates o1:k1:h7/nm showed to accumulate a high number of virulence markers. thus, 85% of the  <dig> expec b <dig> and 74% of the  <dig> expec d strains were positive for at least eight virulence genes. twenty-eight different profiles based on the combination of positive virulence genes were observed . the  <dig> isolates belonging to the phylogroup b <dig> exhibited  <dig> profiles  with  <dig> to five virulence genes, and the most prevalent virulence profile was 6– <dig> detected in  <dig> isolates of the three expec pathotypes  positive for fimh, papc, iron, fyua, iuta, cvac, iss, trat, malx, and usp. the  <dig> isolates belonging to the phylogroup d exhibited nine profiles  with  <dig> to five virulence genes, and the most prevalent profile was 21– <dig> detected in five isolates  positive for fimh, fimavmt <dig>  papc, sat, fyua, iuta, trat, malx, and usp.

papg alleles
the papc gene was detected in  <dig> of  <dig> isolates  . of those  <dig> papc positive isolates,  <dig> harboured papg allele ii and two papg allele i . the other four positive papc e. coli were negative for all three papg alleles . these four strains were tested again by pcr with primers designed by us to check if they possessed new papg varieties. the results showed that the four strains possessed a truncated pap operon .

characterization of expec isolates by mlst
multilocus sequence typing  is a dna sequence-based method that has become of reference to characterize e. coli clones. it has been used to study the population biology of pathogenic microorganisms including e. coli  <cit> , so that the genetic relatedness between isolates can be compared and closely related organisms can be grouped as clonal complexes.

st <dig> complex has been reported to contain the related bacteria of serogroups o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> that express the k <dig> polysaccharide  <cit> . lau et al.  <cit>  also detected st <dig> complex in one o <dig> isolated. in the present study, mlst analysis of the  <dig> expec strains o1:k1:h7/nm identified those two st complexes and five different sts with the same combination of alleles across the seven sequenced loci: st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and two novel combination of alleles that were assigned to the new st <dig>  and st <dig>  .

macrorestriction profiles by pfge
in a similar study, moulin-schouleur et al.  <cit>  comparing o18:k1:h <dig> isolates of human and avian origin did not detect pfge profiles with an identity higher than 80% between avian and human expec strains. by contrast, in the present study, pfge revealed  <dig> clusters of 85% similarity  grouping  <dig>  of  <dig> strains, with clusters iv, v, vi, vii, viii and xii including apec and human upec/septicemic strains .

in view of the results obtained in the present study by phylogenetic typing and mlst, two clonal groups  could be defined among pathogenic expec strains of the serotype o1:k1:h7/hnm. the st <dig> b <dig> isolates constitute a homogeneous clonal group on the basis of the considerable similarity of the pfge profiles that indicates recent divergence from a common ancestor. furthermore, if we consider strains sharing the same st, the same phylogenetic group, the same pfge cluster and the same virulence genotype to belong to the same subclone, four closely related subclones were defined among strains st <dig> : subclone a ; subclone b ; subclone c ; and subclone d . interestingly, subclone c grouped six strains  originated from two different countries. on the other hand, strains belonging to the clonal group d st <dig> , showed very specific characteristics, different from those of phylogenetic group b <dig>  thus, d o1:k1:h7/nm st <dig> strains were almost exclusively isolated from humans; all but one showed to be nonmotile , versus six of  <dig> b <dig> strains ; the virulence gene profile of these strains was also different, in fact the nine profiles exhibited by group d were exclusive of it; and genes fimavmt <dig>  sat were significantly linked to this phylogroup . by pfge, d o1:k1:h7/nm st <dig> strains showed to be very heterogeneous. thus,  <dig> of  <dig> st <dig> appeared grouped in two separated clusters of  <dig> and 81% similarity, respectively. only one subclone sharing the same st, phylogenetic group, pfge cluster and virulence genotype was identified: subclone e .

CONCLUSIONS
as shown in previous studies, some closely related clones can be involved in extraintestinal infections in humans and poultry  <cit> . most of these studies included strains of various serogroups, so it is difficult a detailed comparison to know whether apec and human strains are identical or not. in order to answer this question, we focused our work on a collection of avian and human expec strains belonging exclusively to the serotype o1:k1:h7/nm which is one of the predominant serotypes implicated in neonatal meningitis, uti, septicemia, as well as in avian collibacilosis.

some interesting remarks can be posed from our study. firstly, we have detected a high prevalence of genes known for their association with expec or apec virulence , confirming the pathogenic potential of o1:k1:h7/nm strains. besides, we have detected significant genetic differences translated into two clonal groups defined on the basis of phylogenetic typing and mlst: b <dig> st <dig> o1:k1:h7/nm and d st <dig> o1:k1:h7/nm. the clonal group b <dig> st <dig> detected in apec and human expec strains, recovered from different dates and geographic sources  provides evidence that some apec isolates may act as potential pathogens for humans and, consequently, poultry as a foodborne source, suggesting no host specificity for this type of isolates. finally, a novel and important finding in our study has been the detection of the clonal group d o1:k1:h7/nm st <dig> strains exclusively in humans , carrying pathogenic genes linked to the phylogenetic group d, which would suggest a host specific pathotype. due to the limited number of avian strains included in the study, and in view of the importance of this conclusion, we analyzed and extra group of  <dig> apec isolates o1:k1:  from different provinces throughout spain, obtained from  <dig> to  <dig>  by phylogenetic typing, all of them showed to belong to the phylogroup b <dig>  confirming previous results. further research is necessary to deeply analyze this clonal group apparently specific of human isolates.
