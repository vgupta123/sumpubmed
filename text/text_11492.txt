BACKGROUND
tight junctions  and the subjacent adherens junctions  constitute the apical junctional complex , which is responsible to maintain the epithelial phenotype  <cit> . tjs form a semi-permeable diffusion barrier in an ion- and size- selective manner through the paracellular pathway and have a fence function to maintain cell polarity as a boundary between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains  <cit> . ajs are the main adhesive junctions involved in the mechanical strength of tissues  <cit> . recent studies suggest that these complexes not only mediate cell-cell adhesion, but are also engaged in signal transduction  <cit> . e-cadherin, the main protein of ajs interacts with the cytoskeleton via association with cytoplasmic proteins, the α-, β – and p120-catenins. whereas β-catenin associated with e-cadherin at the plasma membrane regulates cell-cell adhesion, cytoplasmic β-catenin is involved in signal transduction and activation of genes, which play important roles in the development and progression of colorectal carcinoma  <cit> . the role of tj proteins is less understood in this context. a number of integral membrane proteins associated with tjs have been identified during recent years. these include occludin, junctional adhesion molecule  and the claudin family consisting of at least  <dig> members. pdz proteins of the maguk family are other integrant proteins of tjs, which are localized at the membrane-cytoskeleton interfaces of cell-cell contacts. they include the zonula occludens proteins zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and zo- <dig>  which are potentially involved in cell signaling  <cit> . the role of zo- <dig> protein is related to the interaction with the transcriptional factor zonab, known to regulate many events such as growth and proliferation  <cit> .

prostaglandins  are bioactive lipid molecules produced by the cyclooxygenase enzymes cox- <dig> and cox- <dig>  and exert diverse physiological actions in the gastrointestinal tract including maintenance of mucosal integrity, regulation of secretion and cell motility  <cit> . clinical and experimental data indicate that prostaglandin e <dig>  plays a predominant role in promoting cancer progression. it was reported that pge <dig> stimulates ep receptor signaling with subsequent enhancement of cellular proliferation, promotion of angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of invasion/motility of colon cancer cells, as well as tumorigenic potential in intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . it has been reported that both cox- <dig> and the epidermal growth factor receptor  are activated in most human cancers. the observation that forced expression of cox- <dig> in human colorectal cancer  cells stimulates proliferation through egfr activation, suggests the likelihood of a cross talk between these two pathways  <cit> . in a previous study we have demonstrated a link between the pkc, egfr and mapk pathways to modulate the loss of e-cadherin dependent cell-cell adhesion in caco- <dig> cell  <cit> .

pge <dig> has also been implicated in direct egfr activation through intracellular phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase or extracellular release of a membrane-bound egfr ligand, such as heparin-binding egf in human colorectal cancer cells  <cit> . however, the involvement of ep receptor subtypes in these studies has been not reported. furthermore, it was shown in ls174t, a human colorectal cancer cell line, that pge <dig> induces expression of amphiregulin, an egfr ligand, through a protein kinase a -dependent mechanism  <cit> . although it is known that pge <dig> is the ligand to four ep receptors subtypes called ep <dig>  ep <dig>  ep <dig> and ep <dig>  which are the products of separate genes  <cit> , the lack of information concerning the role that each ep receptor plays hinders the understanding of pge2-mediated gastrointestinal physiology alterations. moreover, the precise role of each ep in the malignant behavior remains to be defined. some studies have reported the participation of the ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptor in promoting tumorigenic behavior in colon carcinogenesis  <cit>  and downregulation of subtype ep <dig> during colon cancer development  <cit> . however, the identification of ep modulating epithelial barrier function through mediation of ajc disassembly events has not been reported.

the aim of the present study was to investigate the response of caco- <dig> cells to treatment with pge <dig>  we hypothesized that pge <dig> would impair the ajc assembly and function of caco- <dig> cells. we examined ajc protein distribution, paracellular permeability and identified the involvement of ep receptors as well as cell signaling pathways in response to prostanoid treatment. we report in this study that treatment with pge <dig> caused a transient ajc disassembly through a network involving ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptors and pkc signaling with claudin- <dig> as target related to tjs effects in the human colon cancer cells, caco- <dig> 

RESULTS
prostaglandin e <dig> treatment causes a differential redistribution of the ajc proteins
initially, we analyzed the distribution of the ajc proteins after treatment with pge <dig> by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against e-cadherin, β-catenin, claudin- <dig>  occludin and zo- <dig>  figure  <dig> shows a continuous and intense labeling at the cell-cell contact region for all proteins used in non-treated cells. after pge <dig> treatment, it was possible to observe alterations in the immunostaining pattern of ajc proteins with exception of zo- <dig> that remained at the membrane. after  <dig> min of treatment e-cadherin appears in a discontinuous and irregular string-of beads-shape at the cell-cell contacts. at  <dig> min internalization into the cytoplasm was observed but at  <dig> min there was a significant recovery of the labeling pattern. β-catenin at  <dig> min also showed a discontinuous and irregular labeling at the membrane with projections to the cytoplasm; at  <dig> min and  <dig> min of treatment it appears with minor translocation into the cytoplasm, however a considerable amount of the protein was still at the membrane. immunostaining of claudin- <dig> at  <dig> min showed a discontinuous membranous staining in same regions of cell-cell contact and at  <dig> min this effect was more evident with strong points of labeling and a weak or absent staining in the cell-cell contact area. at  <dig> min there was a labeling recovery at the cell-cell contacts. occludin appears with no alterations at  <dig> min, however after  <dig> and  <dig> min of treatment projections in the direction of the cytoplasm mainly at  <dig> min, were observed.

we further analyzed the subcellular distribution of ajc proteins by immunoblotting using soluble and insoluble tx- <dig> fractions after pge <dig> treatment . the distribution pattern and densitometry analysis of the aj proteins, β-catenin, and e-cadherin showed a significant translocation from the insoluble fraction to the soluble in cells that were treated for  <dig> min with pge <dig> . in a similar manner, this same effect was observed for the tj proteins, claudin- <dig> but not for occludin . together these results indicate that pge <dig> treatment caused a differential redistribution of the ajc proteins.

pge <dig> induce ultrastructural ajc alterations with concomitant loss of tj functionality
we examined morphological alterations of ajc caused by pge <dig> treatment using transmission electron microscopy . non-treated caco- <dig> cells form a well-organized monolayer with a typical junctional complex in the apical region and exhibit numerous microvilli . when cells were exposed to  <dig> μm of pge <dig>  wide spaces at the sub apical cell-cell contact region were visible after  <dig> and  <dig> min and at  <dig> min there was an apparent recovery of the ajc. although alterations well pronounced at the aj area was observed, the tj region apparently remained intact during the pge <dig> treatment .

in order to verify tj functionality after pge <dig> treatment, the epithelial barrier function was assessed in individual cell junctions, using the ruthenium red technique and electron microscopy and in the cell monolayers by monitoring the ter. as seen in figure  <dig>  ruthenium red added to the apical region did not permeate through the tjs of untreated cells, but it permeated through the paracellular space in cells treated with pge <dig>  both at  <dig> and  <dig> min. next, the permeability to ions of confluent caco- <dig> cells was assessed by ter measurements, which showed a value of about  <dig> Ω.cm <dig>  in untreated cells. however, pge <dig> treatment caused a significant drop of the ter  after  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively, but after  <dig> and  <dig> min there was a recovery. additionally, using  <dig>  16-dimethyl prostaglandin e <dig> , a synthetic analogue of pge <dig>  we confirmed similar effects to those observed when cells were treated with pge <dig> .

identification of prostaglandin e <dig> receptor subtypes ep involved in the ajc disassembly
pge <dig> is known to interact with four different types of cell surface prostaglandin e receptors , which in turn activate different signaling pathways  <cit> . in the present study we identified pge <dig> receptor subtypes ep involved in ajc disassembly using butaprost, an ep <dig> specific receptor agonist and sulprostone and 17-phenyl trinor, both ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonist receptors and by ter measurements . butaprost, sulprostone and 17-phenyl trinor were seen to cause a significant ter decrease after  <dig> and  <dig> min of treatment when compared to non-treated cells, however after  <dig> and  <dig> min there was a reverse effect on the ter measurements. it is important to emphasize that although sulprostone and 17-phenyl trinor pge <dig> are ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptor agonists, in the concentration here used , they have a higher affinity for the ep <dig> receptor  <cit> . this result was similar when the cells were treated with pge <dig> or with its analogue, , which indicates the involvement of ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptors in a transient ajc disassembly mediated by pge <dig> 

pge <dig> module ajc disassembly through pkc signaling
there are no data about the cell-cell adhesion mechanisms mediated by pge <dig>  nor information concerning the signaling pathways involved in this event thus, we decided to investigate downstream cell signaling mechanisms triggered by the ep receptors after pge <dig> treatment . when cells were pretreated with sb <dig>  an inhibitor of p <dig> mapk, it was possible to observe that the inhibitor did not prevent the drop of the pge2- induced ter. incubation of caco- <dig> cells with h- <dig>  a pka blocker, did not prevent the ter decrease after  <dig> and  <dig> min of pge <dig> treatment, but abolished the gradual ter re-stabilization promoted after  <dig> and  <dig> min. it is important to point out that, although the ic <dig> of h- <dig> for pka is  <dig> or  <dig> nm  <cit> , we used the concentration of  <dig> μm on the basis of previous studies showing that it is also able to inhibit pka activity in culture cells  <cit> . next, we verified if pkc is involved in this event and observed that pretreatment with calphostin c, a well-known inhibitor of novel and conventional pkc isoforms, prevented the ter drops at all assessed times . we further confirmed this later result by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis using claudin- <dig>  a tj protein known to be involved in the regulation of the paracellular permeability  <cit> . figures 6b and 6c show the reversible effect on the translocation to the tx-soluble fraction and redistribution of this protein through pretreatment with calphostin c prior to incubation for  <dig> min with pge <dig>  in parallel, we also verified the effect of calphostin c on the ultrastructural status of the ajc and tj functionality using the ruthenium red marker. in figure 6d it is possible to see that pretreatment with the pkc inhibitor completely blocked the permeation of the marker through the paracellular space caused after treatment for  <dig> and  <dig> min with pge <dig>  the ruthenium red in cells pretreated with calphostin c was restricted at the apical region in a similar manner as in untreated cells. taken together these results indicate that pkc is involved in the modulation of the ajc disassembly in pge2- stimulated caco- <dig> cells.

discussion
the loss of the ajc assembly by deleterious inflammatory mechanisms is an important problem in intestinal physiology due to the contribution of this structure to the maintenance of cell-cell adhesion. pge <dig> has been implicated in essential physiological processes in the colon such as electrolyte transport, cell motility and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases where increased levels of pge <dig> are observed in inflamed tissue  <cit> . also, pge <dig> has been reported as having a role in intestinal tumorigenesis  <cit> . thus, there is strong evidence indicating a link between ajc regulation, intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. however the mechanisms underlying the pge <dig> effects on ajc disassembly, a pivotal event at the beginning of the colorectal tumorigenesis, remain to be elucidated.

the results reported here show that pge <dig> treatment caused transient differential redistribution of the ajc proteins in caco- <dig> cells. we observed, by immunofluorescence, that aj proteins, β-catenin and e-cadherin undergo significant alteration in localization. similarly, tj proteins claudin- <dig> and occludin showed an apparent redistribution from cell-cell contacts to the cytoplasm; however zo- <dig> remained unaltered. by immunoblotting it was possible to observe a significant increase in the soluble tx- <dig> fraction of β-catenin, e-cadherin and claudin- <dig>  but not for occludin. furthermore, electron microscopy analysis of the subapical ajc region revealed wide spaces in this area in response to pge <dig>  but the tj regions apparently remained unaltered. concomitantly to these results, we showed a significant decrease of the ter, as well as increased permeation to ruthenium red marker in cells treated with pge <dig>  since tjs are largely responsible for regulating paracellular permeability  <cit>  it is probably that pge <dig> acts directly against the components of these structures. the distribution analysis of claudin- <dig> tends to support this conclusion, since the translocation of this protein from the tx- <dig> insoluble fraction  to the tx- <dig> soluble fraction  is associated with the drop of the ter and permeation to ruthenium red in response to pge <dig>  several groups have described the involvement of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnfα and interferon-γ, on ajc proteins and barrier function modulation  <cit> . in relation to pge <dig>  only one study carried out by martin-venegas et al.,  <cit>  reported increased paracellular permeability when differentiated caco- <dig> cells were stimulated with pge <dig>  nevertheless, in this study the ajc protein distribution was not carried out, different pge <dig> concentrations were used and paracellular permeability alteration was only evidenced after  <dig> h of treatment. in our work here we also reported altered cytoskeleton-linked claudin- <dig>  as evidenced by their translocation to tx- <dig> soluble fraction in pge2-treated cells, corroborating with the paracellular permeability alteration. this result is consistent with studies showing that alterations in distribution or expression of claudin- <dig> play an important role in epithelial barrier function  <cit> . adaptor zo proteins have been documented as being responsible for the connection between claudins and the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the fact that we did not find distribution differences of zo- <dig> in pge2- treated cells, suggests that other adaptor proteins, not investigated here, could be mediating this linkage.

prostanoids such as pge <dig> exert their biological action through binding to four specific membrane receptors – the subtypes ep <dig> to ep <dig> that are g protein-coupled receptors  <cit> . the expression and involvement of these receptors in colorectal cancer has been reported  <cit> ; however it is not known whether these receptors are involved in the regulation of the ajc disassembly and consequently contribute to carcinogenesis colorectal. here, we showed the involvement of pge <dig> receptor subtypes ep <dig> and ep <dig> in mediating ajc disassembly. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that 17-phenyl trinor pge <dig>  butaprost, and sulprostone caused a significant decrease in the ter at  <dig> and  <dig> min in a similar manner to pge <dig> and its analogue. it has been reported that both, sulprostone and 17-phenyl trinor pge <dig> are ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptor agonists, however in the concentration of  <dig> μm used in the present study, they have a higher affinity for the ep <dig> receptor  <cit> . since previous results show that caco- <dig> cells express only ep <dig> and ep <dig> subtypes of pge <dig> receptors  <cit> , we suggest that pge <dig> mediates ajc disassembly through ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptors in this cell line.

it is known that ep <dig> receptors are coupled to pka/adenyl cyclase and mediate the increase of intracellular camp  <cit>  whereas ligand binding of ep <dig> is associated with phospholipase c and pkc activation  <cit> . on the other hand, studies have demonstrated the involvement of various cell signaling pathways such as: pkc, pka, mapk, and pi3k/akt in the regulation of the tj barrier function  <cit> . in our pge <dig> stimulation model using caco- <dig> cells, we found that pge2-ep <dig> and -ep <dig> receptor signaling to decrease ter was predominantly linked to the pkc pathway, but not to pka or p38mapk. it is known that pkc has long been recognized to affect epithelial and endothelial barriers. this kinase consists of a family of ser/thr-specific kinases, which includes  <dig> known isozymes that can be classified into three subfamilies: conventional , novel  and atypical , which differ in their mechanism of action, subcellular distribution, substrate type and expression  <cit> . in addition, several studies using different agents that perturb the epithelial junctional complex have demonstrated the involvement of various kinases in the phosphorylation and regulation of claudin proteins, however the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unknown. in relation to pkc, a recent study using three complementary molecular approaches and caco- <dig> cells showed that the pkc-θ isoform plays various novel mechanisms in intestinal epithelium, namely: alterations of the claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> isotypes phosphorylation, membrane assembly, and distribution as well as permeability function in cell monolayer  <cit> . if this pkc isoform is responsible to mediate alteration in claudin- <dig> in caco- <dig> cells treated with pge <dig>  remain to be elucidated. it is an important addition to studies on cell signaling mechanisms involving ep receptors in colorectal cancer that are usually aimed at analysing proliferation or apoptosis events, but not epithelial cell barrier function. for instance, it was reported that in an ep <dig> receptor expression model with hek <dig> cells, camp signalling appears to play a minor role in proliferation  <cit> . by contrast, camp-dependent suppression of apoptosis by pge <dig> seems to occur by a mechanism dependent on erk and p38mapk signaling, but not pka  <cit> . also, pge2-dependent egfr activation in human colorectal cancer cells appears to be variable, with responsive  and unresponsive  cell lines described  <cit> . recently, using a model of ep <dig> receptor overexpression in ht- <dig> cells, it was shown that pge2-ep <dig> receptor signaling was linked predominantly to camp signaling and in low level to erk activation, but not pkb/akt signaling  <cit> . there is a clear significant heterogeneity of signaling pathways mediating pge <dig> activities in different colorectal cells and the interplay between ep receptor subtypes, which are variably present on different colorectal cancer cell lines, may explain this event. interestingly, we did not find pka involvement in ter decrease, however it is recognized that camp can also signal in a pka-independent manner via the camp-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor epac <dig>  which in turn activates ras-gtpase rap <dig>  <cit> . additional studies are needed to elucidate if epac  <dig> is involved in ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptor signaling pathways mediated by pge <dig>  moreover, the fact that h- <dig> did prevented ter recovery after  <dig> and  <dig> min of treatment with pge <dig>  suggests that pka activation is necessary for ajc restoration, which is consistent with data showing that pka is related to positive regulation of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion  <cit> .

in summary, we have shown that pge <dig> can affect ajc architecture and function and that at least part of this effect is mediated through pkc activation in an event that requires the participation of ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptors and claudin- <dig> as an important target of pkc for the tj-related effects.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we analyzed cell signaling mechanisms underlying pge <dig> treatment on the apical junctional complex assembly and function in a human colon cancer cell model. using a physiologically relevant prostanoid dose it was possible to observe that ajc proteins are differentially redistributed and this effect was concomitant to an impairment of the paracellular permeability in caco- <dig> cells. we demonstrated for the first time that pge2-ep <dig> and ep <dig> receptor signaling regulates ajc disassembly through a mechanism that involves pkc, but not pka or p38mapk and reveals a critical role of claudin- <dig> in this event. examination of these pathways can give a better understanding of the mechanisms concerning the loss of cell-cell adhesion and colon cancer progression and suggest new directions for potential therapy for this disease.
