BACKGROUND
we are studying the role of the highly conserved nuclear factor i  family of site-specific dna-binding proteins in metazoan development. nfi was first identified as a protein from human hela cells required for efficient adenovirus  dna synthesis in vitro  <cit> . a binding site for nfi proteins in the ad origin of replication is essential for viral replication both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . these and other studies suggested that nfi proteins may function in the replication of host cell dna  <cit> . however there is no direct evidence to support or refute a role for nfi proteins in host dna synthesis. in contrast, many studies have identified nfi binding sites in the promoter and distal control regions of cellular genes, and deletion analysis of sites shows that nfi proteins are important for gene expression in a variety of cell types  <cit> .

four conserved nfi genes are present in vertebrates   <cit> . single nfi genes have been identified in the simple metazoans amphioxus, c. elegans, and drosophila  <cit> , but no nfi genes are present in fungi, arabidopsis or any sequenced prokaryotic genome. thus the nfi gene family arose during early metazoan evolution and appears to be present only in multicellular animals. nfi proteins bind as either homo- or heterodimers  <cit>  to the symmetric consensus sequence ttggcgccaa in duplex dna  <cit> . nfi proteins also bind with lower affinity to sites containing a single ttggc motif  <cit> . nfi homo- and heterodimers bind to the same sites with similar affinities, making it difficult to determine which family members play essential roles at specific cellular promoters. in addition, the  <dig> nfi genes in vertebrates are alternatively spliced  <cit>  and are expressed in specific but widely overlapping patterns during embryogenesis and adult life  <cit>  making it difficult to assess the role of specific nfi genes in development. the role of the nfi genes in development is of particular interest because binding sites for nfi proteins have been identified in genes expressed in virtually every tissue and organ system of vertebrates including brain  <cit> , muscle  <cit>  and other tissues. nfi proteins have also been implicated in the control of gene expression by a number of hormones and physiological modulators including glucocorticoids  <cit> , insulin  <cit> , tgfβ  <cit>  and others.

to assess the roles of nfi genes in development we began a genetic analysis of the nfi genes in mice and c. elegans. disruption of nfia results in neurological defects including agenesis of the corpus callosum, loss of midline glial cells  <cit> , hydrocephalus and perinatal lethality  <cit> . disruption of nfic causes defects in tooth development  <cit>  while loss of nfib results in perinatal lethality due to defects in lung maturation  <cit> . in each knockout defects are seen in the presence of the other three vertebrate nfi genes, suggesting that the  <dig> mouse nfi genes each have essential roles in development. however the presence of  <dig> nfi genes in mice has made it impossible to test whether nfi activity per se is essential for survival.

since c. elegans has only one nfi gene , it provides an ideal system to assess the role of nfi in dna replication and simple animal development. we show here that c. elegans nfi- <dig> and its products share many properties with their vertebrate homologs including similar dna-binding activity, alternative splicing and expression during embryogenesis and in adult tissues. loss of nfi- <dig> results in viable worms with multiple defects in locomotion, pharyngeal pumping and egg-laying, and a shortened life-span. thus, nfi- <dig> is non-essential for survival but plays an important role in c. elegans physiology.

RESULTS
alternative splicing and promoter of the nfi- <dig> gene
the c. elegans nuclear factor i gene  was first identified by the c. elegans sequencing consortium by its homology to mammalian nfi genes  <cit> . only a single nfi gene is present in the c. elegans genome  while vertebrates possess  <dig> nfi genes. to confirm the structure of the nfi- <dig> gene, we obtained cdnas from the kohara and tigr libraries and made primers within predicted exons for production of cdnas from rna of adult worms and purified eggs. these cdnas confirmed the presence of  <dig> exons and showed alternative splicing of exons  <dig> and  <dig> . the differential splicing pattern of nfi- <dig> indicates that different isoforms may be expressed in different cell types. primary transcripts from most c. elegans genes are trans-spliced to sl <dig> leader sequences and detection of sl1-linked transcripts is frequently used to assess the initially transcribed exons of genes  <cit> . we confirmed the start site of the gene using pcr with an sl <dig> primer for sl1-containing transcripts and a primer in exon  <dig> 

dna binding by cenfi is indistinguishable from that of human nfi-c
the predicted dna-binding domain of nfi- <dig>  shares homology with the vertebrate nfi proteins, however  <dig> of  <dig> residues that are completely conserved among the  <dig> mouse nfi proteins are changed in cenfi . to assess the dna-binding activity and specificity of cenfi, the dna-binding domain  of cenfi was cloned in frame with a  <dig> histidine-tag, expressed in e. coli, partially purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and was used for in vitro dna binding assays. the dna-binding activity of cenfi-h <dig> was indistinguishable from that of the human hnfi-c220h <dig>  with both proteins binding the nfi-site oligo  <dig>   but not the c <dig> oligo containing a point mutation that prevents vertebrate nfi binding  <cit> . to ask if wild-type c.elegans contains a protein with similar dna binding properties as cenfi-h <dig>  extracts were prepared from a mixed population of worms and tested for binding to the  <dig>  and c <dig> sites. as expected, proteins were detected that bound to the  <dig>  but not the c <dig> site, confirming the binding specificity of cenfi . the specificity of the native and recombinant cenfi proteins was also measured by competition of binding of the  <dig>  oligo with various unlabeled oligonucleotides and was indistinguishable from the specificity of hnfi-c220-h <dig> . thus despite the differences between cenfi and vertebrate nfis in conserved residues of their dna-binding domains, their dna-binding activities are indistinguishable.

expression of nfi- <dig> in embryo and adults
in the mouse, the  <dig> nfi genes are expressed in a complex overlapping pattern during embryogenesis and in adult tissues  <cit> . to assess the expression pattern of nfi- <dig> transcripts in c. elegans, a digoxin-labeled antisense probe from the 3' end of the nfi- <dig> transcript was used for in-situ hybridization to fixed embryos and whole worms  <cit> . nfi- <dig> transcripts are present in the one-cell  and two-cell stages  prior to the onset of zygotic transcription  <cit> , indicating that the transcript is maternally inherited. expression continues in most cells of the embryo throughout early and mid-embryogenesis  but decreases after gastrulation and no expression is seen in l <dig> larvae . as expected for a maternally inherited transcript, expression of nfi- <dig> reappears in the adult gonad . expression of nfi- <dig> transcripts are also seen in the cytoplasm of gut cells . no signal is seen using control sense probes . this in situ expression pattern indicates that nfi- <dig> could function both early in embryogenesis and in adult worms.

isolation of a null allele of nfi-1
to assess the role of nfi- <dig> in worms, we isolated a nfi- <dig> mutant using a reverse genetic approach based on the insertion-excision of the transposon tc <dig>  <cit> . worms carrying an ~ <dig> kb deletion in nfi- <dig> were isolated by pcr screening and sib-selection . sequence analysis of the nfi- <dig> transposon excision allele ) showed loss of the genomic region corresponding to nucleotides 14754– <dig> of cosmid zk <dig>  this eliminates the first  <dig> exons of nfi- <dig> including sequences encoding the dna-binding domain. rt-pcr shows the absence of nfi- <dig> transcripts in mutant worms . a gel mobility shift assay, using nuclear extracts prepared from mix-stage populations of c. elegans wild type and nfi- <dig> mutant worms confirmed the loss of cenfi dna-binding activity in the mutant worms . thus, this mutation in the nfi- <dig> gene is a null allele. the survival of worms homozygous for the null allele shows that nfi- <dig> is not essential for worm survival. the nfi- <dig> mutant allele was backcrossed  <dig> times to the wild-type n <dig> strain to remove unwanted mutations prior to assessment of the phenotype.

phenotype of nfi- <dig> mutant worms
locomotion defect
loss of nfi- <dig> results in a body movement defect . nfi- <dig> mutant animals are fairly active and healthy, but are sluggish and flaccid at rest and slightly longer and thinner than n <dig> worms . while wild type worms usually move in straight long lines, nfi- <dig> mutant worms often change direction abruptly . the nfi-1mutant worms produce less regular tracks on the bacterial lawn with higher amplitude, and sometimes are slightly coiled when compared to wild-type worms . this phenotype is more severe in older adults.

egg-laying defect 
17–35% of older nfi- <dig> mutants have a "bag of worms" phenotype, where the mother is unable to lay fertilized eggs and fills with hatched progeny . appearance and severity of this egg-laying phenotype correlates with the progressive locomotion defect, as young adult nfi- <dig> mutant worms do not bag. in young adults, serotonin stimulated egg-laying in both the wild type and nfi- <dig> mutant animals to a similar extent , indicating that the postsynaptic response to serotonin is normal and the contractile apparatus for egg-laying is intact in nfi- <dig> mutant worms.

life-span reduction
the nfi- <dig> mutant worms have a median life span of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days for wild type worms  . mutant worms become progressively more sluggish and flaccid as they age. we are currently investigating whether this lifespan reduction is due to the apparent progressive muscle weakness and partial paralysis seen or to a direct effect on known ageing pathways  <cit> .

pharyngeal pumping rate defect
since the unc and egl phenotypes of nfi- <dig> mutant worms could reflect aberrant muscle function, we examined another process that can influenced by muscle defects, pharyngeal pumping rate. pharyngeal pumping rates are reduced in nfi- <dig> mutant worms , with more severe reductions in older vs. younger adult animals .

a pharyngeal pumping was counted for one minute starting on day one, when animals first reached adulthood, for four consecutive days.

b n <dig> and nfi- <dig> mutant worms were transformed with a transgene containing the nfi- <dig> gene and upstream promoter and rol- <dig> .

c this value is statistically significantly different from n <dig> 

d this value is statistically significantly different from n <dig> 

e this value is statistically significantly different from nfi- <dig> 

rescue of nfi- <dig> mutant with nfi- <dig> transgene
transgenic rescue was performed to test whether loss of the nfi- <dig> gene was responsible for the observed phenotypes. transgenic strain xa <dig> qaex <dig> was made by injecting a plasmid containing a  <dig> kb region of genomic dna including the nfi- <dig> coding region and ~ <dig> kb of upstream promoter region together with a rol- <dig> expressing plasmid into the gonads of n <dig> worms. we crossed the resulting transgenic array into nfi- <dig> mutant worms to produce strain xa <dig> nfi- <dig> qaex <dig>  egg-laying was completely rescued in nfi- <dig> qaex <dig> worms when compared to the nfi- <dig> mutant worms . in addition, the median life span in nfi- <dig> qaex <dig> worms of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days was significantly longer than the  <dig>  ±  <dig>  day life span of nfi- <dig> mutant worms , but slightly less than the  <dig>  ±  <dig>  day life span of n <dig> worms . the n <dig> qaex <dig> stain used as a control has a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  day median life span, identical to that in non-transgenic n <dig> worms. the pharyngeal pumping defect was also partially rescued by transgenic expression of nfi- <dig> . the nfi- <dig> transgene had little or no effect on pumping rates in n <dig> worms . these data provide a well-defined developmental system affected by loss of nfi- <dig> that can be examined for cell-autonomous or inductive roles of nfi- <dig>  the presence of the rol- <dig> marker gene prevented scoring of rescue of the locomotion phenotype in nfi- <dig> qaex <dig> worms.

our in situ hybridization data indicate that nfi- <dig> transcripts are provided maternally. to test whether maternal nfi- <dig> transcripts could rescue the nfi- <dig> egl phenotype, nfi- <dig> qa524/qa <dig>  nfi- <dig> qa524/+ and +/+ progeny of heterozygous nfi- <dig> qa524/+ parents were scored for the egg-laying defect . bagging was seen in 41% of the resulting nfi- <dig> qa524/ qa <dig> worms, in  <dig> % of nfi- <dig> qa524/+ worms but in <3% of +/+ animals. these data indicate the absence of maternal transcript rescue and possible haploinsufficiency at the nfi- <dig> locus. thus, transgenic replacement of nfi- <dig> yields either partial  or complete  rescue of the phenotypes seen in the nfi- <dig> mutant worms whereas maternal nfi- <dig> transcripts are insufficient to rescue the egg-laying defect.

ce titin expression is reduced in nfi- <dig> mutant worms
we used cdna microarrays to identify genes whose expression is affected by loss of nfi- <dig>  such genes could be either direct or indirect targets of nfi- <dig>  poly a+ rna was purified from wild type and nfi- <dig> mutant synchronized gravid adults, labeled, and used to probe dna microarrays containing ~ <dig>  c. elegans genes . we analyzed rna from gravid adults because the phenotype differences between nfi- <dig> mutant and wild type animals are clearer in adults than at earlier stages. the nfi- <dig> gene was scored as the most down-regulated gene in nfi- <dig> mutant worms in all experiments . several dozen genes showed small apparent reductions or increases in levels  in mutant adults  but only one gene, c. elegans titin  showed larger changes.

ce titin  was predicted to be  <dig> -fold lower in mutant worms by microarray analysis. quantitative pcr confirmed that ce titin is reduced 8– <dig> fold in adult nfi-1mutant worms . to date this is the gene that shows the largest decrease in expression in nfi- <dig> mutant worms. a search of the ce titin gene reveals no overabundance of nfi binding sites . also, a cetpro transgene expressing a translational fusion of gfp to the 5'-end of the ce titin gene  <cit>  appears to be expressed at similar levels in wt and nfi- <dig> mutant worms . it will be important in future studies to determine whether ce titin is a direct or indirect target of nfi- <dig> and the possible role of ce titin in the phenotypes observed.

expression of nfi-1::gfp reporter transgenes
one limitation of in situ hybridization in c. elegans is that in older embryos and postembryonic stages it is sometimes not sensitive enough to unambiguously identify individual cells. since we saw little or no nfi- <dig> expression in muscle by in situ hybridization, in an effort to develop a more sensitive assay for nfi- <dig> expression we constructed two gfp-reporter transgenes . in pro1cenfi::gfp,  <dig> kb of genomic dna sequence upstream of the nfi- <dig> open reading frame and the sequence encoding the first four residues of the cenfi protein was fused in frame to gfp. in pro2cenfi::gfp, the  <dig> kb promoter region and the sequence encoding the first  <dig> residues of cenfi has been fused to gfp. gfp expression for both transgenes was detected in embryos . faint gfp expression is first detected at the late gastrulation stage of embryogenesis  as a diffuse green glow throughout the embryo. by the comma stage expression is detected in many cells along the outer edge of the embryo and expression continues through embryogenesis and is detected in l1-l <dig> larvae in many of the same cells as in adults. adult transgenic animals show gfp expression in muscles, neurons and intestinal cells . among the muscles, fluorescence was strongest in the pharynx and head muscles, was observed with less frequency in other body wall muscles and was seen occasionally in vulva muscles. expression was also seen in two pairs of neurons located near the posterior bulb of the pharynx, and in several as yet unidentified tail neurons. expression patterns in multiple transgenic lines from each reporter were similar with the exception that pro2cenfi::gfp expression was detected more consistently in head neurons and pro1cenfi::gfp was seen with higher frequency in body-wall muscles. however expression of both transgenes was mosaic, showing expression in only subsets of cells and animals in each population. since mosaic expression of gfp was seen in transgenic strains from both arrays, transgenic array pro1cenfi::gfp was integrated by γ-irradiation. however similar mosaic expression was seen with the integrated array . these data may indicate that additional elements are needed for stable regulation of nfi- <dig> expression and that such elements may be located further downstream in the nfi- <dig> genomic sequence.

discussion
nfi- <dig> gene structure and dna binding properties
these data show that nfi- <dig> is not essential for embryogenesis and thus is not essential for dna replication. however the multiple defects seen in nfi-1-deficient worms, abnormal locomotion, pharyngeal pumping and egg-laying defects, and a reduced lifespan indicate that nfi- <dig> is essential for these developmental and behavioral processes. nfi- <dig> shares a number of properties with the vertebrate nfi genes, including alternative splicing  and the dna-binding properties of its protein product cenfi . the alternative splicing seen in nfi- <dig> is reminiscent of the complex splicing pattern seen in the vertebrate nfi genes  <cit> . while the relevance of this alternative splicing in c. elegans is unclear, the finding that alternatively spliced forms of vertebrate nfis have different transcriptional modulation properties  <cit>  suggests that the multiple c. elegans isoforms may also have distinct functions. it will be of particular interest to determine whether alternatively spliced isoforms of nfi- <dig> are differentially expressed in worm cells during development and in adults. in addition, when specific downstream targets of nfi- <dig> are identified it will be important to determine whether the isoforms differ in their ability to modulate gene expression in c. elegans.

the sequence conservation of the predicted dna-binding domain of nfi- <dig> with the vertebrate nfi proteins was the initial indication that nfi- <dig> encodes the single c. elegans nfi gene. however among the  <dig> mouse  nfi genes,  <dig> of  <dig> residues of their dna-binding domains are completely conserved, while  <dig> of these  <dig> residues are changed in cenfi . we show that cenfi binds to the same dna sequence as hnfi-c and that binding is abolished by a point mutation known to abolish binding by products of the  <dig> vertebrate nfi genes   <cit> . this raises the question of why there has been so little divergence of the  <dig> vertebrate nfi dna-binding domains during evolution. while we have shown similar dna binding specificities of cenfi and hnfi-c to a matched set of wt and mutant nfi binding sites, it is possible that subtle differences exist in their dna-binding specificity or affinity or that the conserved vertebrate residues are more important for binding within the more complex vertebrate genome. since the  <dig> vertebrate nfi genes are sometimes expressed in the same cells in vivo  <cit> , it is possible that there has been selection for conservation of residues involved in dna binding due to competition between the  <dig> nfi gene products, and that this has led to the observed high degree of sequence conservation. similar high levels of sequence conservation are seen in the dna-binding domains of all the homologous vertebrate nfi genes from xenopus  <cit>  to humans  <cit> .

it is possible that the additional conserved residues in the vertebrate nfi dbds compared to nfi- <dig> confer additional functions to the vertebrate nfi proteins, such as interacting with proteins required for transcriptional modulation specifically in vertebrates, or for the stimulation of ad dna replication. indeed,  <dig> sets of mutations in the nfi-c dbd that abolish ad replication without affecting dna-binding or dimerization are in residues not conserved between nfi-c and cenfi  <cit> . however, each of the  <dig> cysteine residues shown previously to be essential for dna-binding activity and redox-regulation of dna-binding activity of vertebrate nfis are conserved in cenfi   <cit> . the conservation of these cysteine residues is consistent with our observation that the dna-binding activity of cenfi is sensitive to reversible inactivation by chemical oxidizing agents such as diamide in vitro , as is the activity of the vertebrate nfis  <cit> . given the divergence of the cenfi and vertebrate nfi dbds it will be important to determine whether the nfi- <dig> dbd can substitute for the vertebrate nfi dbds in vivo, and whether the vertebrate nfi dbds possess equivalent activities in c. elegans in vivo.

defects in nfi- <dig> mutant worms
deletion of the nfi- <dig> gene results in a number of behavioral defects, each of which may be related to defects in muscle or neural function. the c. elegans hermaphrodite has four major muscles types, body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and enteric  <cit> . body-wall muscles and pharyngeal muscles, used in locomotion and pumping food, respectively, function in the processes affected in nfi- <dig> mutants. the structures most often affected in unc mutants are the body-wall muscles, the nervous system and the hypodermis  <cit> . polarized light microscopy showed no obvious deformities in the body wall-muscles of nfi- <dig> mutant animals, such as defects in muscle attachment and overall sarcomere structure. thus, the muscles appear normal at a gross level. likewise, we analyzed the expression pattern of the body wall muscle specific hlh-1::gfp  <cit>  and muscle specific cetpro transgenes  <cit>  in the nfi- <dig> deletion mutant background by confocal microscopy and saw no differences between mutant and wild type animals . thus any muscle defects are not due to gross structural changes within the muscle. many older nfi- <dig> deficient animals display egg-laying defects, suggesting that vulval or/and uterine muscles or their controlling neurons may be affected. the normal stimulation of egg-laying by serotonin suggests that there is no major loss of vulval or uterine muscle function in young adult nfi- <dig> deficient worms  <cit> . we have visually examined the functions of the enteric muscles involved in food movement through the gut and defecation and found no obvious defects in young adults. in older adults, contractions of the enteric muscles were less regular, but it is unclear whether this is an intrinsic defect or related to the defects in pharyngeal pumping seen in older adults.

the absence of obvious muscle defects in nfi- <dig> null worms raises the possibility that neural defects could underlie the phenotypes seen in these animals. for example, nfi- <dig> mutants show a reduced pharyngeal pumping rate, a process regulated primarily by the m <dig>  m <dig> and mc pharyngeal neurons  <cit> . some or all of defects seen in nfi- <dig> mutant worms, mild unc with flaccidity, pharyngeal pumping and egg-laying are also seen in worms containing single mutations in genes expressed in neurons. for example, some mutations in egl- <dig>  a heterotrimeric gqα subunit expressed in muscles and neurons, have weak unc, egg-laying and pharyngeal defects  <cit> . in addition, some loss of function mutations in the g protein signaling molecule egl- <dig> and the gβ <dig> ortholog eat- <dig> cause sluggish movement, egg-laying, and pharyngeal pumping defects  <cit> . since a number of eat genes are expressed specifically in neurons, these data indicate that neural dysfunction caused by loss of nfi- <dig> could generate this range of phenotypes. it will be important in future studies to determine whether nfi- <dig> expression is needed neurons, muscles, both cell types or other cell types to alleviate the phenotypes seen in nfi- <dig> mutant worms. while our preliminary qpcr data indicate no changes in the transcript levels of egl- <dig>  egl- <dig> or eat- <dig> , it is possible that the activity of the g protein signaling system is affected in nfi- <dig> mutant worms. thus, it would be useful in future studies to directly test whether nfi- <dig> is involved in g protein signaling in c. elegans.

the only gene whose expression has been shown to change in response to loss of nfi- <dig> is the muscle-specific gene ce titin. this reduction in a muscle-specific gene indicates that muscle defects could contribute to the observed locomotion and other phenotypes. ce titin is a massive protein, with isoforms in c. elegans of  <dig> mda,  <dig> mda and 301kda  <cit> . ce titin is found in the i-bands of larval and adult muscle in worms. mutations in mouse titin genes cause muscular dystrophy  <cit> , cardiac development defects and muscle weakness  <cit> . thus, down regulation of ce titin expression could contribute to the motility and egg-laying defects observed in nfi- <dig> mutants. however, the large size of the ce titin gene has made it difficult to generate transgenic lines that conditionally express ce titin. recent studies have reported that neither existing mutations in ce titin, nor rnai experiments, have provided clues as to the function of ce titin in worms  <cit> . thus it will be important in the future to test directly the role of ce titin in the defects seen in nfi- <dig> mutant worms.

finally, it is unknown whether the observed motility, egg-laying and pharyngeal pumping defects contribute to the shortened life-span of nfi- <dig> null worms. for example, as pharyngeal pumping becomes more defective the animals could starve, leading to progressive muscle wasting, paralysis and death. however, most severe eat mutants have extended lifespans rather than reduced lifespans, most likely due to caloric restriction  <cit> . these data indicate that the reduced lifespan seen in nfi- <dig> deficient worms could be independent from the pharyngeal pumping defect. in addition, while bagging could reduce apparent lifespan, we eliminated bagged animals from our lifespan analysis so as to exclude bagging as a direct cause of the shortened lifespan. lastly, the motility defect is seen in young adults a few days prior to bagging and is seen in all adults, even those that do not bag. thus it appears unlikely that bagging contributes directly to the movement defect. it will be important to use directed expression of nfi- <dig> in different cell types to test the dependence or independence of the observed phenotypes from each other. we are also currently testing whether nfi- <dig> is part of the genetic pathways known to be important in worm aging including the daf pathway  <cit> .

roles of nfi transcription factors in development
since nfi genes have been found in all metazoa sequenced to date and multiple nfi genes are present in complex animals  <cit> , it was our initial hypothesis that nfi- <dig> would be essential in worms and that deletion of the gene would be lethal. lethality would be predicted if nfi- <dig> has an essential role in dna replication. however, all of the defects observed are late physiological defects and are most severe in older adults. this set of late defects can be compared to the late gestational defects seen with deletion of single nfi genes in mice. disruption of the mouse nfia gene causes agenesis of the corpus callosum, the loss of specific midline glial populations and perinatal lethality  <cit> . loss of nfic produces specific defects in tooth development including aberrant incisor formation and failure of root formation in molar teeth  <cit> . targeted insertion into the nfib locus causes perinatal lethality due to a failure of late fetal lung maturation  <cit> . one common feature of the defects seen in nfi-deficient mice is that they occur either late in fetal development , or early in postnatal development . while some of the developmental systems affected by the loss of nfi genes in mice are not present in worms , it is possible that the underlying molecular mechanisms disrupted in nfi-deficient mice are also affected by loss of nfi- <dig> in worms. thus it will be important to test genes identified as important in the phenotypes of nfi-deficient mice for potential roles in the motility, egg-laying and pharyngeal-pumping defects seen in nfi-1mutant worms.

CONCLUSIONS
these data show that nfi- <dig> is not essential for worm survival but plays important roles in locomotion, egg-laying, pharyngeal pumping and maintenance of a normal life-span. these are the first data to show that while nfi proteins are essential for adenovirus dna replication, they are not essential for dna replication in simple animals.

we show that while many residues of the dna binding domain of worm nfi differ from those found in vertebrate nfis, the dna binding activity and specificity of the worm protein is indistinguishable from that of the vertebrate nfis. these data suggest that the very strong conservation of many residues in the dna-binding domains of vertebrate nfis is not needed for dna-binding specificity but may serve another function, perhaps for interactions with specific vertebrate proteins. in addition, like the vertebrate nfi genes nfi- <dig> is alternatively spliced, raising the possibility that different cenfi isoforms may have different biological functions.

the phenotypes of nfi- <dig> null worms are rescued by zygotic expression of nfi- <dig> from its natural promoter but not by maternal transcripts. we propose that nfi- <dig> regulates gene expression directly in cells in which it is expressed and affect the function of these cells. however, the precise cell types in which loss of nfi- <dig> causes these defects in motility, egg-laying, pharyngeal pumping and lifespan is unknown. directed expression of nfi- <dig> in different cells of the worm should allow us to determine in which cells nfi- <dig> is needed for normal lifespan, motility, egg-laying and pharyngeal pumping.

future studies will assess whether c. elegans can be used as an experimental system to assess the potentially distinct physiological functions of the vertebrate nfi gene products. for example, if the  <dig> vertebrate nfi genes have segregated the functions of the single worm nfi- <dig> gene into  <dig> distinct entities, then each vertebrate nfi gene might have distinct properties when expressed in nfi-1mutant worms. it will also be important to determine the specific nfi- <dig> target genes in c. elegans whose altered expression is responsible for the phenotypes observed, the specific cell types in which nfi- <dig> must be expressed to prevent each phenotype, and to use c. elegans genetics to identify genes essential for nfi-regulated transcription.
