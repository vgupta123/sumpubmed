BACKGROUND
the initiation of skeletal myogenesis involves a complex interplay of signalling molecules secreted from the tissues surrounding the somite, including wnt, sonic hedgehog, and bone morphogenetic proteins  <dig>   <cit> . somites respond to the various signals by activating the expression of transcription factors that specify cells to the skeletal muscle lineage, including pax <dig>  meox <dig> and gli <dig>  <cit> . commitment into skeletal myoblasts is dependent on the expression of the myogenic regulatory factors , including myod, myf- <dig>  myogenin and myf-6/mrf4/herculin, and is regulated by factors in the dermomyotome  <cit> .

p <dig> cells are pluripotent embryonal carcinoma  cells, derived from mouse embryonic stem  cells, that can differentiate into cardiac and skeletal muscle in a dimethylsulfoxide - and aggregation-dependent manner  <cit> . while cells grown in monolayer maintain their stem cell phenotype, the process of cellular aggregation initiates mesoderm induction, shown by the expression of brachyury t  <cit> . subsequent muscle development proceeds in the presence of dmso. the order of transcription factors and signalling pathways for myogenesis in p <dig> cells appear to be similar to those during early embryogenesis. thus p <dig> cells are a useful tool for examining in vitro myogenesis, potentially leading to novel mechanisms relevant to es stem cell therapy.

retinoic acid  is a derivative of vitamin a and plays a crucial role in a wide variety of embryonic developmental processes  <cit> . in the embryo, the ability of ra to bind its receptors  is precisely controlled by regulating the availability of ra through proteins that synthesize ra, such as retinaldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig> , and those that metabolize ra, such as cyp <dig>  and other proteins that transport or bind ra.

low levels of ra are known to enhance skeletal myogenesis in stem cells and myoblast cell lines  <cit> . ra can regulate mrf expression in myoblasts and chick limb  <cit> , whereas rars interact and synergize with mrfs  <cit> . however, the exact stage at which ra functions to enhance skeletal myogenesis in a stem cell context has not been clearly defined.

altered ra signalling in vertebrates affects body patterning, generating homeotic transformations and/or segmentation defects  <cit> . in xenopus embryos, ra signalling regulates segmental patterning by promoting anterior segmental polarity and by positioning segmental boundaries  <cit> . in mice, ra coordinates somitogenesis and left-right patterning  <cit> . how the effect of ra on the somite impacts on the development of the myotome is not well understood.

in the canonical pathway, wnt binds to cell surface receptors of the frizzled family, leading to the activation of dishevelled and stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin  <cit> . in a simplified view, β-catenin enters the nucleus, binds the t-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor  family of transcription factors, and activates gene expression. several studies have shown that exogenous wnt and/or activated β-catenin can replace the dorsal neural tube in the induction of myogenesis in somite explant cultures  <cit> . a combination of wnt and shh signals regulates the expression levels of both β-catenin and lef <dig> in the myotome prior to myod expression in the chick  <cit> . further, β-catenin regulates the expression of pax <dig>  <cit> . in p <dig> cells, a dominant negative β-catenin inhibits the expression of pax <dig>  gli <dig>  meox <dig>  myod, and abrogates myogenesis  <cit> . finally, wnt was shown to act directly on the myf <dig> epaxial enhancer via β-catenin  <cit> . therefore, there is strong evidence that wnt signalling regulates specification and commitment into the skeletal muscle lineage. how wnt signalling intersects with ra signalling during myogenesis is unknown.

bmp <dig> belongs to the tgf-β superfamily of peptide growth factors  <cit> . bmps inhibit myogenesis in myoblast cell lines, limb micromass cultures, and developing somites  <cit> . noggin signals are derived from the notochord and the somite. noggin signalling is believed to counteract the inhibitory effects of bmp <dig> on the epaxial somite  <cit> . further experiments using somite explants showed that relative levels of bmp <dig> and noggin regulated the activity of pax <dig> to control the temporal and spatial activation of the mrfs  <cit> . therefore, extensive studies have demonstrated the inhibition of embryonic skeletal myogenesis by bmp. how bmp signalling intersects with ra signalling is unknown.

the role of bmp in cardiomyogenesis has also been extensively studied. in drosophila, the bmp homologue decapentaplegic protein  is secreted from the dorsal ectoderm and maintains tinman expression in the mesoderm  <cit> . similarly, in chick bmp <dig> or - <dig> is expressed in tissues adjacent to the precardiac mesoderm and can induce nkx2- <dig> and gata- <dig> expression  <cit> . conversely, disruption of bmp signalling with noggin or dominant negative receptors can prevent cardiomyogenesis in chick, xenopus, es, p <dig> and p19cl <dig> cells  <cit> . therefore, bmp/dpp signalling is essential in controlling cardiomyogenesis.

studies with embryonic stem and embryonic carcinoma cells have shown that ra inhibits cardiomyogenesis when added at an early stage  <cit>  and enhances es cell cardiomyogenesis when added at a late stage of differentiation  <cit> . ra can block myocardial gene expression, including xnkx <dig> , in xenopus embryos  <cit>  and can alter cardiomyogenesis proliferation and patterning in other model systems  <cit> . mice lacking various combinations of rxrs and rars have shown that retinoids are required to prevent differentiation and support proliferation of ventricular cardiomyocytes  <cit> . ra deficiency in raldh <dig> -/- mice alters second heart field formation  <cit> . clearly, ra affects the timing and positioning of cardiomyogenesis at multiple levels and further studies are required to dissect out the role of ra at each step of development.

here we investigate signalling events leading to the control of stem cell entry into skeletal and cardiac muscle lineages by ra, wnt, and bmp <dig>  we show that low levels of ra stimulate skeletal myogenesis by accelerating and increasing the expression of wnt3a, pax <dig>  meox <dig>  and mrfs. this early and enhanced activation of skeletal muscle is refractory to inhibitory signals from bmp <dig> but not from a dominant negative β-catenin. furthermore, low levels of ra inhibit stem cell differentiation into the cardiac muscle lineage, as shown by the absence of gata- <dig> expression. the inhibitory activity of ra on cardiomyogenesis can be abrogated by the presence of bmp <dig>  therefore, bmp <dig> and ra function antagonistically to regulate each other's inhibition of entry into skeletal and cardiac muscle lineages, respectively. however, ra functions both upstream and downstream of wnt signalling through β-catenin.

RESULTS
ra inhibits cardiomyogenesis and enhances entry into the skeletal muscle lineage in p <dig> cells
previous studies have shown that ra can inhibit cardiomyogenesis and enhance skeletal myogenesis  <cit> , but the stage at which this occurs and the interaction with other signalling pathways have not been clearly defined. to investigate the mechanisms by which ra modulates myogenesis in p <dig> cells, various concentrations of ra, in the presence of dmso, were examined. in agreement with previous results  <cit> , it was found that skeletal myogenesis occurred in the presence of dmso but not in its absence . furthermore, 3- <dig> nm of ra with dmso was sufficient to block cardiac and enhance skeletal muscle development . a time course of p <dig> cell differentiation was carried out in the presence of dmso, with and without  <dig> nm of ra. cells were fixed on day  <dig> for immunofluorescence and stained with an anti-myosin heavy chain  antibody, mf <dig>  which identifies myhc in both cardiac and skeletal myocytes. cardiac and skeletal myocytes can be distinguished by their morphology and time of appearance, with rounded cardiac myocytes appearing by day  <dig> and elongated, bipolar skeletal myocytes by day  <dig>  <cit> . cells treated with ra did not differentiate into cardiac muscle, evidenced by the absence of rounded cardiac myocytes, expressing myhc, compared to cells not treated with ra . in contrast, significantly enhanced levels of bipolar skeletal myocytes were observed in the presence compared to the absence of ra . quantification of the number of cardiac and skeletal myocytes after treatment with ra showed that the fourfold increase in skeletal myocytes and eightfold loss of cardiac myocytes were statistically significant . therefore, in agreement with others  <cit> , ra inhibited cardiomyogenesis and enhanced skeletal myogenesis in p <dig> cells.

p <dig> cell lines indicated on the right were aggregated under the conditions described and the induction of muscle marker gene expression was monitored.



in order to examine the molecular basis of the effects of ra on myogenesis, total rna was harvested from a time course of cells differentiated with and without ra and subjected to northern blot analysis. endogenous raldh <dig> levels were enhanced on day  <dig> of the dmso-induced differentiation in the absence of exogenous ra , indicating that endogenous ra signalling could be involved at this stage of development  <cit> . ra-treated cells showed enhanced expression of raldh <dig> from days 3- <dig> . to determine at what stage cardiomyogenesis was inhibited by ra, expression of the cardiomyoblast gene gata- <dig>  was examined  <cit> . northern blot analysis revealed a lack of induction of gata- <dig> transcripts in cells treated with ra , consistent with the interpretation that under these conditions ra inhibits commitment into the cardiac muscle lineage.

in order to determine at which stage skeletal myogenesis was enhanced, the expression of genes expressed in the primitive streak , the dermomyotome , and skeletal myoblasts  was examined. mesoderm induction occurred in the presence of ra, shown by the expression of brachyury t . the levels of brachyury t appear to be slightly decreased with ra, consistent with the increasing differentiation of mesodermal progenitors. in contrast to the results with gata- <dig> expression, wnt3a , pax <dig> , meox <dig> , myod  and myogenin  transcripts were upregulated with ra treatment , which is consistent with an increase in skeletal myogenesis. quantitative polymerase chain reaction  was used to quantify the levels of pax <dig>  myod and wnt3a transcripts, showing a 9-95-fold upregulation of these factors with ra treatment . hence, ra enhances skeletal myogenesis by upregulating wnt3a, pax <dig> and meox <dig> .

since bmp <dig> is known to inhibit skeletal and enhance cardiac myogenesis  <cit> , and ra has been shown to inhibit bmp <dig> expression in the limb forebud  <cit> , we examined the expression of bmp <dig> transcripts in the presence and absence of ra . the endogenous levels of bmp <dig> were down-regulated in ra-treated cells relative to the controls from days 3- <dig>  finally, we examined the expression of the transducer of erbb <dig> , an intrinsic inhibitor of bmp signalling  <cit> . tob <dig> was upregulated by ra from days 2- <dig> . thus, ra may function to enhance skeletal myogenesis and inhibit cardiomyogenesis in part by inhibiting bmp <dig> expression and/or function.

to identify direct chromatin targets of rar binding, we used multiple sequence local alignment and visualization  to find ra response elements  sequences  located within +/-  <dig> kb of the start site for wnt3a, pax <dig> and meox <dig>  while all three genes contained rare sequences, only one of the two meox <dig> sites  and one of the two pax <dig> sites  were conserved between mouse and human, located in mus musculus at - <dig> bp and +  <dig>  respectively . chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on day  <dig> of differentiation, using an antibody that recognizes all rars. we detected a significant  <dig> -fold enrichment in chromatin fragments corresponding to the meox1- <dig> site, and a significant  <dig> -fold enrichment in chromatin fragments corresponding to the pax3- <dig> site compared to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit igg as a negative control . we also tested several of the non-conserved rares identified upstream of wnt3a. one of these rares  showed a significant  <dig> -fold enrichment. several non-conserved rare sequences in wnt3a, meox <dig>  or pax <dig> genes were not significantly associated with immunoprecipitated rars, whereas a known site in rarβ <dig> was associated, as expected  <cit> . thus, rars bind to conserved elements in the meox <dig> and pax <dig> genes as well as to one non-conserved element upstream of wnt3a in a population of differentiating p <dig> cells, indicating that ra functions both upstream and downstream of wnt3a signalling.

ra enhances skeletal myogenesis in mes cells
to determine if our results in p <dig> cells were applicable to mouse embryonic stem  cells, we differentiated mes cells in hanging drops for  <dig> days and in suspension culture for an additional  <dig> days, the latter with 0- <dig> nm ra. after re-plating in tissue culture dishes, cells were harvested on days  <dig> and  <dig> for rna and fixed on day  <dig> for immunofluorescence. examination of rna by rt-pcr indicated increasing transcript levels of meox <dig>  pax <dig>  and myod in the presence of retinoic acid, peaking at  <dig> nm . quantification of gene expression changes by q-pcr indicated statistically significant 20-fold increases in pax <dig> and meox <dig> expression on day  <dig> and a significant fivefold increase in myogenin on day  <dig> . finally, skeletal myocytes were not observed on day  <dig> in the absence of ra, as shown by the lack of bipolar cells reacting with mf <dig> . in the presence of  <dig> nm ra, myhc+ve bipolar skeletal myocytes were visible . thus, similar to the findings in p <dig> cells, ra treatment of mes cells results in the enhancement of skeletal muscle progenitor formation, shown by the increase in expression of pax <dig>  meox <dig>  myod, and myogenin .

ra cannot bypass the inhibition of skeletal myogenesis by a dominant negative β-catenin
since earlier studies have shown that wnt signalling, via β-catenin, activates pax <dig>  gli <dig> and meox <dig> expression, inducing skeletal myogenesis in p <dig> cells  <cit> , we were interested in determining how the wnt signalling pathway intersects with ra signalling. furthermore, a dominant negative β-catenin, with the transcriptional activation domain replaced by an engrailed repressor domain , inhibited skeletal myogenesis in p <dig> cells  <cit> . this dominant negative approach identifies genes bound by β-catenin and their downstream targets. in order to determine if ra can bypass this inhibition, p <dig> cells expressing β-cat/enr were differentiated in the presence of dmso, with and without ra and compared to control p <dig> cells. cultures were fixed on day  <dig> and examined by immunofluorescence with mf <dig>  in agreement with previous results  <cit> , the overexpression of β-cat/enr resulted in the loss of skeletal myogenesis, shown by the lack of bipolar skeletal myocytes, compared to control cells . the addition of ra resulted in an increase in the number of skeletal myocytes observed in control cells , but not in p <dig>  cells . therefore, ra was not sufficient to circumvent the inhibition of skeletal myogenesis by β-cat/enr.

to examine at which time point the ra enhancement of skeletal myogenesis was inhibited by β-cat/enr, rna was harvested on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from p <dig>  and p <dig>  cultures differentiated with increasing amounts of ra. northern blots showed the expression of exogenous β-cat/enr in the p <dig>  cells and not in p <dig>  cells . endogenous β-catenin expression was constitutive, as expected . in agreement with figure  <dig>  myod, meox <dig> and pax <dig> were upregulated with  <dig> and  <dig> nm ra in p <dig>  cells, compared to no ra treatment . gli <dig> was upregulated during myogenesis on days  <dig> and  <dig>  in agreement with previous results  <cit> , but was not further upregulated by ra . interestingly, while myod and meox <dig> were no longer upregulated by ra in the presence of β-cat/enr , pax <dig> transcript levels were increased by ra treatment . myogenin and myf- <dig> were also not upregulated in p <dig>  cells treated with ra . the enhancement of gli <dig> during myogenesis  was abrogated in the presence of β-cat/enr , as shown previously  <cit> . this loss of gli <dig> expression was reversed in the presence of ra . therefore, the ra enhancement of myod and meox <dig> was abrogated in the presence of β-cat/enr, but not the enhancement of pax <dig>  furthermore, the gli <dig> expression became responsive to ra in the presence of β-cat/enr .

changes in gene expression for pax <dig> and pax <dig> were quantified by q-pcr . ra treatment resulted in the increased expression of pax <dig> and pax <dig> in p <dig>  cells on days  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, both pax <dig> and pax <dig> were upregulated by ra in the presence of β-cat/enr.

to further assess the relationship between ra and wnt, the ability of ra to activate a β-catenin-responsive promoter - topflash - which contains  <dig> high mobility group  box sites, was examined using luciferase assays and compared to a mutated hmg box promoter, fopflash  <cit> . both  <dig> and  <dig> nm ra were sufficient to induce four- to fivefold increases in β-catenin activity in aggregated p <dig> cells . interestingly, the activation by ra required cellular aggregation, since ra did not significantly enhance β-catenin function in monolayer cultures. furthermore, no evidence was obtained of synergy or inhibition of rarβ on β-catenin activity using a β-catenin-responsive topflash reporter , in contrast to previous reports of inhibition  <cit> . thus ra can activate β-catenin function in dmso-treated p <dig> aggregates, likely by enhancing β-catenin translocation to the nucleus.

induction of pax <dig> by ra is not due to enhanced neurogenesis
since high levels of ra  can induce neurogenesis in p <dig> cells and both pax <dig> and shh signalling via gli <dig> can regulate neurogenesis in spinal cord and brain  <cit> , the increase in pax <dig> mrna may not reflect skeletal myogenesis but, rather, result from an increase in neurogenesis. to test this hypothesis, we quantified the percentage of cells that differentiated to a neuronal phenotype in p <dig>  and p <dig>  cells under cardiac and skeletal myogenic conditions , skeletal myogenic conditions , or neurogenic conditions  . differentiation to a post-mitotic neuronal phenotype was identified by labelling of neuron-specific β-iii tubulin using anti-tuj <dig> antibodies. as expected,  <dig> μm ra triggered a significant neuronal differentiation compared to dmso alone . however, neurogenesis with  <dig> nm ra was variable and was not significantly different compared to dmso alone . consistent with previous reports that the dominant-negative inhibition of β-catenin signalling reduces neurogenesis  <cit> , we found that significantly fewer cells differentiated to tuj1-positive neurons in p <dig>  cultures treated with  <dig> μm ra .

in order to determine whether pax3/ <dig> proteins were found in neurons, or in neural precursor cells, we used immunofluorescence to co-localize pax3/ <dig> proteins with neuronal markers . anti-tuj <dig> antibodies were used to detect immature neurons and anti-double cortin  antibodies were used to detect committed neuronal precursor cells. dcx protein is expressed as early as  <dig> day after the initiation of neurogenesis in p <dig> cells and is the earliest known marker of neurogenesis  <cit> . to confirm that p <dig> cells do not express pax3/ <dig> following neuronal commitment, we quantified the percentage of pax3/7-positive neuronal precursors and immature neurons in our day  <dig> cultures . under all conditions tested, the overwhelming majority of pax3/7-positive cells were non-neuronal . no pax3/7-positive neurons were detected in p <dig>  cultures under conditions promoting skeletal myogenesis  . taken together, these results provide strong evidence that enhancement of pax <dig> and gli <dig> expression by low concentrations of ra is indicative of increased skeletal myogenesis and not neurogenesis.

overexpression of bmp <dig> blocks skeletal myogenesis in p <dig> cells
since ra enhances skeletal myogenesis, while downregulating bmp <dig> expression, we were interested in examining the interplay between ra and bmp <dig> in p <dig> cell myogenesis. in order to examine the effect of bmp <dig> on skeletal myogenesis in a stem cell context, stable cell lines expressing bmp <dig> were isolated and termed p <dig>  cells. when aggregated in the absence of dmso and examined for immunofluorescence with mf <dig>  neither skeletal nor cardiac myogenesis occurred in p <dig>  cells . when cells were aggregated in the presence of dmso, p <dig>  cells differentiated into cardiac muscle  but not skeletal muscle . under these conditions, control cells differentiated efficiently into both cardiac  and skeletal muscle . furthermore, a similar inhibition of skeletal myogenesis was obtained when parental p <dig> cells were mixed with p <dig>  cells in various ratios and aggregated in the presence of dmso . this indicated that bmp <dig> can function extracellularly. by counting the number of mhc+ve cells, skeletal myogenesis was inhibited an average of approximately fivefold in the presence of bmp <dig> and cardiomyogenesis was enhanced about  <dig> -fold . thus, overexpression of bmp <dig> in p <dig> cells is sufficient to block skeletal muscle and to slightly enhance cardiac muscle development.

bmp <dig> inhibits skeletal muscle specification
in order to investigate at what point in the pathway bmp <dig> inhibited myogenesis, the expression patterns of skeletal muscle-specific markers in p <dig>  and p <dig>  cells during dmso-induced differentiation were compared. total rna was harvested on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for northern blot analysis. p <dig>  cell lines expressed high levels of bmp <dig> , but failed to express early markers of skeletal myogenesis such as meox <dig> and pax <dig>  and late markers such as myod  compared to p <dig>  cells. a 17-fold loss of myod transcript levels was detected by q-pcr in the presence of bmp <dig> . these findings suggest that bmp <dig> inhibited an early stage of skeletal muscle development by preventing proper muscle specification .

to determine if mesoderm induction, the stage prior to muscle specification, was affected by bmp <dig> expression, a time course of dmso-induced differentiation was performed. p <dig>  and p <dig>  cells were aggregated in the presence of dmso and total rna was harvested during the time course of differentiation for northern blot analysis. p <dig>  and p <dig>  cell lines both expressed the mesoderm markers brachyuryt and wnt5b . wnt5b expression levels appeared to be slightly increased. finally, in order to compare the abilities of ra and bmp <dig> to enhance β-catenin activity, p <dig> cells were aggregated with dmso in the presence and absence of bmp <dig> and the β-catenin-responsive topflash promoter was examined by luciferase assay. bmp <dig> was able to activate the β-catenin-responsive reporter in aggregated p <dig> cells treated with dmso . taken together, these results show that bmp <dig> interfered with skeletal myogenesis at a time point after mesoderm induction but before the specification of skeletal muscle.

reciprocal regulation of myogenesis by ra and bmp4
since bmp <dig> was found to inhibit, and ra to enhance skeletal muscle specification in p <dig> cells, we wanted to determine if bmp <dig> could override the enhancement of skeletal myogenesis by ra, and vice versa for cardiomyogenesis. to this end, p <dig> cells were mixed with p <dig>  or p <dig>  cells and aggregated in the presence of dmso with or without ra. as expected, p <dig> cells, mixed with p <dig>  cells and aggregated in the presence of dmso, differentiated readily into cardiac and skeletal muscle, as seen by positive myhc staining. as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  and quantified in figure  <dig>  ra inhibited cardiac myogenesis , but not skeletal myogenesis, and bmp <dig> inhibited skeletal myogenesis , but not cardiac myogenesis . however, p <dig> cells mixed with p <dig>  cells and treated with ra differentiated efficiently into both cardiac and skeletal muscle , indicating that ra and bmp <dig> could antagonize each other's inhibitory activities.

the results of immunofluorescence were confirmed by rna analysis. cultures of p <dig> cells mixed with p <dig>  cell lines contained high levels of bmp <dig> transcripts on days  <dig> and  <dig> . gata- <dig> transcripts were present in cultures containing both bmp <dig> and ra, indicating that bmp <dig> abrogated the inhibition of cardiomyogenesis by ra . myod and myosin light chain1/ <dig>  transcripts were absent in p <dig> , compared to p <dig>  cells . in contrast, p <dig> cells treated with bmp <dig> and ra robustly expressed myod and mlc1/ <dig> transcripts . quantification of myod transcript levels under the four conditions by q-pcr was consistent with the results from counting skeletal myocytes . therefore ra enhanced skeletal myogenesis and antagonized the inhibitory actions of bmp <dig> signalling.

based on the inability of bmp <dig> to inhibit skeletal muscle development in the presence of ra, we predicted that the accelerated expression of pax <dig> with ra treatment would still be observed in the presence of bmp <dig>  to test this, we examined a time course of p <dig> cell differentiation in the presence of p <dig>  cells and ra. total rna was harvested on days 1- <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for northern blot analysis. exogenous bmp <dig> transcripts were present in p <dig>  cultures . pax <dig> and myod transcripts were detected in cells treated with ra alone in a similar expression pattern compared to cultures containing both ra and bmp <dig> . these results are in contrast to the loss of pax <dig> and myod expression shown in the presence of bmp <dig> alone . therefore, the early enhancement of pax <dig> expression by ra treatment still occurs in the presence of bmp <dig> .

discussion
we have examined the mechanism of p <dig> stem cell differentiation into skeletal muscle in response to ra, wnt inhibition, and/or bmp <dig>  we show that bmp signalling inhibits skeletal muscle specification, via the loss of pax <dig> and meox <dig>  while ra enhances this step. furthermore, ra can enhance skeletal myogenesis in the presence of bmp <dig> but not dominant negative β-catenin. rars bound directly to rares in the upstream and downstream genomic regions of meox <dig>  pax <dig> and wnt3a. both ra and bmp <dig> can activate the function of β-catenin in a reporter assay in aggregated, dmso-treated, p <dig> cells. thus, ra functions both upstream and downstream of wnt3a signalling to enhance skeletal myogenesis. inhibition by bmp <dig> can be bypassed by ra, implying that ra may function downstream of bmp <dig> or that bmp <dig> inhibition occurs by affecting ra signalling/generation .

in terms of cardiomyogenesis, ra signalling inhibits gata- <dig> expression, resulting in the loss of cardiomyogenesis. ra blocks the expression of endogenous bmp <dig> and activates the expression of tob <dig>  which is an inhibitor of bmp function. the positioning of ra upstream of bmp <dig> expression and activity explains the ability of exogenous bmp <dig> to compensate for the low levels of bmp <dig> in the presence of ra, resulting in the enhancement of cardiomyogenesis .

we have shown previously that β-catenin is sufficient to induce skeletal myogenesis in p <dig> cells, by initiating skeletal muscle specification  <cit> . here we show that rars function as a positive regulator of wnt signalling by binding directly to wnt3a regulatory regions, upregulating wnt3a transcript levels and activating of β-catenin. in other systems, such as f9/mouse es cell differentiation or dorsal quail forebrain, ra can upregulate antagonists of the wnt pathway, restrict wnt expression, or inhibit β-catenin activity  <cit> . in contrast, ra upregulates the expression of wnts during adult murine neurogenesis, or vertebrate limb induction  <cit> . our observed activation of β-catenin by ra did not appear to involve synergistic interactions between rars and β-catenin on a β-catenin-responsive promoter . however, we have not ruled out that, once upregulated by ra signalling, β-catenin might synergize with rars to activate rare-responsive promoters, as described previously  <cit> . interestingly, bmp <dig> treatment also resulted in the activation of the β-catenin-responsive promoter, which is not surprising given that bmps and wnts cooperatively pattern mesoderm  <cit> . it is likely that both ra and bmp <dig> act via canonical wnt signalling to regulate both shared and distinct target genes, which change over time, dependent on combinatorial factors.

pax <dig> expression is sufficient to initiate skeletal myogenesis in aggregated p <dig> cells  <cit>  and it plays an important role in embryonic myogenesis  <cit> . ra accelerated pax <dig> expression in p <dig> cells, likely by activating rars bound directly to pax <dig> regulatory sequences. although pax <dig> expression was not abrogated by the presence of β-cat/enr, and thus likely not bound by β-cat/enr, its expression alone was not sufficient to initiate skeletal myogenesis under these conditions. in contrast, although meox <dig> is also a direct target of rars, it was not upregulated in the presence of β-cat/enr which implies that β-cat/enr may have bound directly to the meox <dig> regulatory sequences and inhibited its activation by rars. future studies will include a global analysis of rar and β-catenin binding sites. the finding that ra cannot bypass the β-cat/enr inhibition implies that β-catenin and rars bind to an overlapping, essential set of genes during myogenesis.

bmp <dig> inhibits skeletal myogenesis in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . in agreement with these studies, we show that bmp <dig> can inhibit the specification of p <dig> cells into the skeletal muscle lineage, shown by the loss of pax <dig> and meox <dig> expression. when combined, ra signalling was able to reverse the inhibition of pax <dig> expression by bmp <dig>  ra signalling enhances the expression of tob- <dig>  which is an inhibitor of bmp signalling. however, it is unlikely that ra functions solely by inhibiting bmp activity. for example, p <dig> cells expressing the bmp inhibitor noggin  <cit>  did not show an enhancement/acceleration of skeletal myogenesis . since ra can activate myogenic progenitor genes in the presence of bmp <dig>  it likely functions to activate transcription downstream of the bmp inhibitory signal.

low levels of ra inhibit cardiomyogenesis in p <dig> cells  <cit> , although the mechanism has not been fully characterized. here we show that ra inhibits the expression of gata- <dig>  preventing mesodermal cells from becoming committed to the cardiac muscle lineage. these results are similar to the finding that continued exposure to ra disrupts heart formation in xenopus and zebrafish, although early in mesodermal patterning ra may increase the proportion of cardiac progenitors  <cit> . low levels of ra may be redirecting pre-cardiac mesodermal cells into pre-skeletal mesoderm in p <dig> cells. furthermore, ra may inhibit cardiomyogenesis via downregulation of bmp <dig> expression and upregulation of the bmp inhibitor tob <dig>  bmp <dig> functions to enhance cardiomyogenesis and can activate nkx2- <dig> and gata- <dig> expression  <cit> . the finding that exogenous bmp <dig> can override the inhibition of cardiomyogenesis by ra suggests that bmp <dig> functions downstream of the ra inhibition, or that bmp <dig> reduces the ability of ra to signal in cardiac muscle precursors.

in p <dig> and p19cl <dig> cells, noggin inhibits cardiomyogenesis, indicating that bmp signalling is essential  <cit> . however, we found that bmp <dig> overexpression was not sufficient to induce cardiomyogenesis in aggregated p <dig> cells without dmso treatment, although a mild upregulation of cardiomyogenesis was observed with dmso. indeed, bmp <dig> during the aggregation stage may be inhibitory to cardiomyogenesis  <cit> . these results contrast with the role of sonic hedgehog , which is sufficient to induce cardiomyogenesis in aggregated p <dig> cells without dmso  <cit> . shh may provide an earlier signal than bmp <dig> in the cascade of events leading to cardiomyogenesis.

in other systems bmp and ra have also been shown to function antagonistically. for example, noggin enhanced ra function in chick chondrocyte maturation  <cit> . in contrast, ra induced the expression of bmp-signalling molecules and enhances bmp effects in chondrocytes  <cit> . ra can induce or inhibit bmp expression, depending on the context  <cit> . finally, bmp2/ <dig> can inhibit ra-induced neurogenesis in p <dig> monolayer cultures  <cit> . given the high degree of complexity of these signalling pathways, further studies are required to delineate the cross-talk mechanisms involved.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have examined the roles of ra, bmp <dig> and canonical wnt signalling in directing entry into the cardiac and skeletal muscle lineages. ra enhanced skeletal myogenesis by inhibiting bmp <dig> expression and function, while activating the expression of pre-skeletal mesoderm genes, and activating wnt/β-catenin signalling. ra inhibited cardiomyogenesis, likely by inhibition of bmp <dig> function. ra and bmp <dig> can each reverse the other's inhibition of myogenesis. therefore, the precise balance of these signalling molecules is necessary to regulate specification into skeletal or cardiac muscle.
