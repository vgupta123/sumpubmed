BACKGROUND
the advent of large-scale transcription profiling technologies, such as dna microarrays  <cit>  and rnaseq technology  <cit> , has allowed the analysis of gene expression patterns at the genome level. dna microarrays have been used for genetic mapping studies based on polymorphisms between parental genotypes  <cit> . when used to analyze genetically segregating populations, dna microarrays have facilitated the discovery of gene expression markers  <cit> . gene expression markers can be defined as transcripts encoded by genes whose relative messenger rna expression level is inherited and segregates as a phenotypic trait  <cit> .

apple tree breeding is a slow and difficult process for reasons that include long juvenility periods, large size of mature plants, inbreeding depression, reproductive self-incompatibility, and complex phenotypes related to grafted trees  <cit> . the use of molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding and selection has the potential to expedite this process by increasing the percentage of desired genotypes and associated phenotypes early on in the breeding pipeline and assisting breeders in combining desirable traits from different parents into breeding progenies  <cit> . in the present study, our objective was to identify genes whose steady-state expression level in healthy, uninfected apple shoot tips correlated with the inheritance of agriculturally important traits in an apple rootstock breeding population. these transcripts would have the potential to be used as molecular markers by themselves, or could be used to develop dna polymorphism markers for marker-assisted selection and gene mapping in the population.

genetics in apple is typically done in the f <dig> generation due to the self-incompatibility of apple  <cit> . the apple rootstock population used for this study was an f <dig> population from a cross of two highly heterozygous rootstock parents, ‘ottawa 3’  and ‘robusta 5’ . this is a phenotypically diverse and well-characterized population that is segregating for numerous traits of interest to apple growers. the segregating traits include resistance to biotic stresses such as fire blight  and powdery mildew  diseases and resistance to the woolly apple aphid  pest.

we applied dna microarray transcription profiling to  <dig> individual f <dig> trees from the o3 × r <dig> cross and identified transcripts with expression levels associated with pm disease and waa pest resistance phenotypes. when the genes encoding these transcripts were mapped to the apple genome, they were found to be physically clustered. this is similar to the phenomenon described for single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression markers in brassica napus <cit> . the utility of using physically clustered, differentially expressed genes for dna marker development will be discussed.

RESULTS
microarrays
rna was isolated from healthy, uninfected, uninfested shoot tips collected from  <dig> individual f <dig> trees from the o3 × r <dig> cross population growing in a rootstock production stool bed in geneva, ny. the rna was used to probe  <dig> microarrays in multi-plex format, using two different color probes per array, so that all  <dig> rna samples could be assayed on the  <dig> microarrays. the microarrays were clustered based on their expression profiles using the hierarchical clustering function in r . the array clustering groups did not consistently correspond with either pm resistance or waa resistance, with closely clustered arrays often including f <dig> individuals with contrasting phenotypes for pm and waa resistance .

physical clustering of differentially expressed genes
a group of f <dig> individuals resistant to pm and a group of f <dig> individuals susceptible to pm were selected . using standard differential expression analysis  <cit> , thirty transcripts whose expression levels were differentially expressed between the pm-resistant and pm-susceptible phenotype groups were identified . the physical locations of the genes encoding these transcripts on the ~ <dig> megabase , 17-chromosome apple genome  <cit>  were determined using the blast  <cit>  server on the genome database for rosaceae  <cit> . twenty-four of the genes were located on chromosome  <dig> , with nineteen being clustered within a 10 mb region centered on the major, previously-identified pm quantitative trait locus  segregating in the in the o3 × r <dig> f <dig> breeding population .

*r-s = resistant - susceptible.

similarly, a group of f <dig> individuals resistant to waa and a group of f <dig> individuals susceptible to waa  <cit>  were selected . using standard differential expression analysis, seven transcripts that were differentially expressed between the waa-resistant and waa-susceptible groups were identified . the genes encoding five of these transcripts lay on chromosome  <dig> , all within the top 9 mb of chromosome  <dig> , and three of these were within about 1 mb of a major, previously-identified waa resistance qtl .

additionally, we performed similar analyses using gene expression markers  <cit>  with clear segregation patterns in the apple f <dig> population as molecular traits . trees were separated into phenotypic groups based on the expression level of the gene expression marker, with one group containing plants with high expression levels of the gene expression marker, and the other group containing plants with low expression levels of the gene expression maker. then, genes that were differentially expressed between the two phenotypic groups were identified by standard differential expression analysis. in all cases examined, genes that were differentially expressed between phenotype groups based on gene expression markers were disproportionately located on single chromosomes , often clustering in the physical vicinity of the gene expression marker gene used to define the phenotypic groups , or occasionally clustering at a separate location .

the expression levels of the physically clustered, differentially expressed genes had a mixture of positive and negative associations with their associated trait . for example, some of the physically clustered genes with expression levels associated with pm resistance had higher expression levels in the resistant trees , while others had lower expression levels in the resistant trees , and the expression levels of intervening genes had no phenotype association . in some instances, differentially expressed genes with positive and negative phenotype associations were in juxtaposition  with as little as 90 kb distance between them . gene expression marker genes with expression patterns not associated with the pm resistance phenotype were visible within the pm qtl region .

it is notable that the genes with trait-associated expression levels did not necessarily have the same expression pattern in all individuals in a phenotype group. for example, pm resistance-associated genes apple0f <dig>  apple0fr <dig>  and apple0f <dig> are visibly quite consistent in their expression within a phenotypic group, while apple0f <dig> and apple0f <dig> are less consistent within each phenotypic group .

validation of gene expression level heritability and consistency
the heritability of expression level of selected genes with trait-associated expression levels was validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis using the o <dig> and r <dig> parents and a group of f <dig> individuals in the o3 × r <dig> f <dig> population growing in a location different from the trees used for dna microarray analysis and sampled during a different year. qpcr analysis showed that pm resistance-associated gene apple0fr <dig> had higher expression in parent r <dig> compared to parent o <dig> , just as predicted by the microarray experiment. furthermore, expression of apple0fr <dig> among the o3 × r <dig> f <dig> population used for qpcr analysis segregated at a 1: <dig> ratio , just as predicted by the dna microarray data. in addition, a gene expression marker that had a distinctly bimodal expression in the dna microarray analysis  also had bimodal expression in the o3 × r <dig> f <dig> population used for qpcr validation; this bimodal expression segregation was visible among pcr amplicons . finally, the relative gene expression level relationships between apple0fr <dig> and several genes with associated expression patterns and which exhibited continuous expression level distribution in the array data  were maintained in the qpcr relative expression data .

development of dna markers based on genes with trait-associated expression level
as a proof of concept, dna markers were developed for waa resistance-associated gene apple0fr <dig>  the sequence of apple0fr <dig> was used to identify malus × domestica contig mdc <dig>  , which contained the best matching dna sequence according to blast analysis. several polymorphisms were identified within this region when comparing the o <dig> haplo-contigs with the r <dig> haplo-contigs. of particular interest for easy marker development were two microsatellite regions between bases  <dig>  -  <dig>  of contig mdc <dig> , for which pcr primer pairs were designed  and tested with parent dna with annealing temperature gradient pcr . both markers were polymorphic between the parents, but only the waa68101-236ssr was heterozygous in the r <dig> parent, showing bands at approximately 360 bp, 460 bp and 520 bp . segregation analysis in the o3 × r <dig> population showed very strong association of the waa68101-236ssr 360 bp band with resistance . the waa68101-236ssr ssr marker was more predictive of waa resistance in the o3 × r <dig> population than the published interval containing the r5-derived er <dig> gene delineated between ssr markers gd <dig>  and gd <dig>   <cit> .

discussion
the results of array clustering for the  <dig> microarrays indicated that overall gene expression patterns of individual plants were not robust indicators of pm or waa resistance phenotype. in contrast, the differential gene expression analysis based on phenotypic groups of f <dig> individuals yielded relatively small numbers of genes that were differentially expressed between the phenotypic groups, and these differentially expressed genes displayed a remarkable degree of physical clustering on the apple genome. the clustered genes were typically in the physical vicinity of the major locus controlling the trait, in the case of pm and waa resistance, or in the vicinity of the gene expression marker used as the molecular trait. clusters at locations unlinked to their corresponding trait of interest  might represent the locations of other qtls related to the phenotype. all of the phenotypes examined in this study were controlled by single, major, dominant qtl, which allowed detection of linkage using only 48 f <dig> individuals. analysis of larger numbers of individuals would certainly be required in order to analyze multi-locus traits effectively.

the clustered differentially expressed genes are not necessarily involved in controlling their associated phenotype. for example, the differentially expressed genes associated with pm resistance did not show any obvious functional patterns or similarities . it is also important to note here that differentially expressed genes we examined here were not selected based on their induced expression during pathogen or insect interaction. rather, the differentially expressed genes represented transcripts whose steady-state expression levels in healthy tissue were associated with pm or waa resistance phenotype status. it is possible that examining differential gene expression using infected or infested samples might mask the clustering due to the large numbers of genes being up- and down-regulated in response to the stress.

the clustering pattern of differentially expressed genes is consistent with the relative expression levels of these genes being inherited from a parent. this is different from genome neighborhood effects, where groups of linked genes are typically up- or down-regulated together  <cit> . just as dna polymorphism markers can be linked to a trait locus, expression patterns of some of the nearby genes are also linked. by grouping trees according to an inherited trait of interest, one might expect that the differentially expressed genes would be identified simply due to their decreased expression variation within a particular pool compared to non-correlating genes at loci unlinked to the trait of interest. however, it is remarkable that the differential expression patterns between the phenotypic groups included so few genes, and that so many of these were physically clustered. this suggests that heritable differences in gene relative expression were predominantly detected by the analysis, rather than genes whose expression levels might contribute to or be necessary for the development of the phenotype. such genes would be expected to be scattered randomly across the genome. our results are similar to those seen in brassica napus using single nucleotide polymorphisms  and gene expression markers  <cit> . however, the present study used a segregating apple tree f <dig> population, while the other study used a collection of accessions.

validation of the expression patterns using qpcr indicated that most of the genes indeed had patterns of expression consistent with the array data. the congruence of dna microarray and qpcr data for selected differentially expressed genes and gene expression markers provided strong validation for the dna microarray data. qpcr validation was successful using a different set of individuals from the same cross in a different environment and year from those used for the microarray, indicating that the differentially expressed genes had relative expression levels consistent across different growing conditions and years and between different groups of individuals from the o3 × r <dig> f <dig> population. the development of pcr based molecular markers associated with several of the differentially expressed sequences was in many cases successful because sequence mutations such as large indels and microsatellite variation was discovered within or nearby the target genes. while several methods are available to detect polymorphisms in marker assisted breeding, markers based on the polymerase chain reaction are still the most accessible and least expensive for small scale breeding programs. the combination of expression analysis for target identification and sequence based marker development proved a good strategy as the pcr markers developed in this study have been routinely proven useful in apple rootstock breeding program in geneva, ny. as rnaseq methods become more refined, it may be possible to find differentially expressed genes associated with traits of interest and at the same time leverage polymorphisms contained in the expressed sequences for haplotype specific breeding marker development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown in a segregating population from the cross of a highly heterozygous plant that gene expression analysis can result in identification of differentially expressed genes that are physically linked to one another. gene expression heritability as a method to detect genes physically linked to trait loci of interest could be useful in crops for which few genetic and genomic information resources are available. even in the absence of a genetic map, molecular markers linked to traits of interest could be developed using transcriptome profiles of segregating populations, since a substantial proportion of the differentially expressed genes would be expected to cluster in the vicinity of the trait of interest. while there may be no causal link between the differentially expressed genes and their associated traits, they do provide an excellent starting point for development of dna markers linked to segregating traits of interest.
