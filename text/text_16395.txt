BACKGROUND
ladybird/lbx proteins are part of a clustered set of nk transcription factors, which encompass the nk <dig> protein tinman/nkx <dig>  the nk <dig> protein bagpipe/nkx <dig>  ladybird/lbx, c15/tlx, and the nk <dig> protein slouch/nkx <dig>  <cit> . in protostome genomes, nk genes are organised into a cluster, which, along with the molecular phylogeny of nk homeodomains, indicates that they originated via tandem duplications  <cit> . indeed, the nk gene cluster is believed to be ancient, with aspects predating the divergence of sponges, cnidarians and bilaterians  <cit> . in deuterostomes, however, tight clustering has been lost with only nkx4/nkx <dig> and lbx/tlx linkages remaining in the cephalochordate amphioxus and in vertebrates  <cit> .

lbx genes have essential roles in development, including crucial functions in neural and mesodermal cell specification. in mammals and amphibians, lbx <dig> controls the emigration of specialised, motile muscle precursors that give rise to limb and hypoglossal/tongue muscles, respectively  <cit> . in mouse embryos, lbx <dig> is also required for the specification of several populations of dorsal spinal cord interneurons, which receive and process somatosensory information from the body  <cit> . moreover, lbx genes with a similar spinal cord expression pattern to mouse have been described in chick, zebrafish and the spotted dogfish and, in the case of zebrafish and chick, these genes are also expressed in muscle  <cit> . interestingly, in drosophila melanogaster, a protostome whose ancestors split from the deuterostome lineage over  <dig> million years ago, two tandem-duplicated ladybird/lbx family members exist  that are also expressed in developing muscle and neural tissue and are required for the specification of subpopulations of myoblasts and neural cells  <cit> . thus, lbx genes may have evolutionarily ancient functions in muscle and neural development.

despite the intriguing similarities of some ladybird/lbx genes, significant differences become apparent when considering all of the members of the lbx family in different vertebrates. for example, mammals, including humans, have two lbx genes  <cit>  as does the chicken  <cit> , whereas danio rerio has three lbx genes , and the genome sequencing project for xenopus tropicalis has so far only revealed one lbx gene . in addition, the expression pattern of mammalian lbx <dig> is distinct from that of lbx <dig>   <cit> , whereas the two chicken lbx genes and all zebrafish genes are co-expressed in migratory muscle precursors . yet the second chicken lbx gene is not expressed in neural tissues  <cit>  while all three of the zebrafish genes are, albeit in distinct regions . consequently, the evolutionary and functional relationship of ladybird/lbx genes is not clear.

it is generally believed that at the base of the vertebrate lineage, the entire genome was duplicated twice . this was followed by a further genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage at the base of the teleost radiation  <cit> . in all chordate relatives of vertebrates investigated so far, such as the urochordates oikopleura dioica and ciona intestinalis and the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae , only a single lbx gene has been found  <cit> . it is, therefore, safe to assume that prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication, only a single lbx gene existed.

one prediction of the 2r hypothesis is that a 4: <dig> ratio of genes should have been present in an ancestral vertebrate when compared to their invertebrate relatives. however, with gene duplicates carrying redundant functions, many of these four copies  were lost. yet, despite considerable interest in lbx gene function in extant vertebrates, orthologies between lbx genes have not been established. therefore, it is not known whether different vertebrate lineages have lost the same, or different, lbx ohnologs. this raises two alternative hypotheses for the differences that have been observed between vertebrate lbx genes.

 <dig>  different vertebrate lineages have retained different lbx ohnologs with distinct expression patterns and/or functions

 <dig>  the same lbx ohnologs have been maintained in all vertebrates with differences in expression or function being due to more recent neo- and/or sub- functionalisation.

to distinguish between these possibilities, we have used a number of bioinformatics approaches to characterise the organisation of lbx loci in extant osteichthyan vertebrates and to determine the relationship of lbx genes and genes associated with lbx loci. our studies identified non-nk genes that were acquired by lbx/tlx region prior to, or during, the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication and that hence, serve as signature genes for these loci. with the help of these signature genes, the remnants of all four lbx/tlx paralogons  were identified. phylogenetic analyses of lbx, tlx and the co-localising non-nk genes revealed that the first round of whole genome duplication in vertebrates created the ancestor of the lbx1/tlx <dig> and lbx4/tlx <dig> clusters plus the ancestor of the lbx2/tlx <dig> and lbx3/tlx <dig> clusters. after the second genome duplication, lbx and tlx genes were lost, such that before the split of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fish lineages only lbx1/tlx <dig>  lbx2/tlx <dig> and tlx <dig> genes were maintained. gene loss also occurred after the additional genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage, leaving teleosts  with two lbx <dig> and tlx <dig> genes but only one lbx <dig>  tlx <dig> and tlx <dig> gene. since the amniote lbx <dig> genes diverge much more in their coding sequences than the lbx <dig> genes and the expression pattern of mouse lbx <dig> is distinct from non-mammalian lbx <dig> genes, we propose that amniote  lbx <dig> genes have evolved at a faster rate and were subject to neofunctionalisation. lbx <dig> genes on the other hand may have retained more features of the original chordate lbx gene.

RESULTS
identification of lbx genes in extant osteichthyes
to reconstruct the phylogeny of vertebrate lbx genes we first attempted to identify the complete set of these genes in representatives of extant osteichthyes. for this, blast-searches of sequence databases were carried out, using the known human and mouse lbx <dig> and lbx <dig>  chicken lbx <dig> and lbx <dig>  xenopus laevis lbx <dig> and zebrafish lbx <dig> sequences as query sequences  <cit> . to obtain outgroups for these phylogenetic analyses, we also searched the databases for lbx/ladybird sequences in invertebrate deuterostomes, including the cephalochordate branchiostoma floridae , the urorchordates oikopleura dioica and ciona intestinalis, and the echinoderm strongylocentrotus purpuratus ; moreover we included sequences from various protostomes. our search confirmed the presence of two distinct lbx genes in placental mammals and marsupials , one lbx gene in the still incompletely sequenced platypus and anole lizard genomes, and two lbx genes in the chicken. only one lbx gene was found for the frog xenopus tropicalis. on the other hand, besides the gene so far known as zebrafish lbx <dig>  <cit> , two novel lbx genes were identified in this organism. three lbx genes were also identified in the teleosts takifugu rubripes , tetraodon nigroviridis, gasterosteus aculeatus , and two genes in oryzias latipes , while only one lbx/ladybird gene was retrieved for the invertebrate deuterostomes.

phylogenetic analysis of osteichthyan lbx protein sequences
to determine the evolutionary relationship between osteichthyan lbx genes, we first determined the phylogenetic relationship of lbx proteins . for this purpose, amino acid sequences were aligned and analysed, using maximum likelihood methods. we found that the vertebrate lbx sequences were assigned to two distinct groups. the first group encompassed the known human, mouse, chicken and frog lbx <dig> proteins. in addition, this group contained the two novel zebrafish lbx proteins, encoded by the genes located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the fugu lbx proteins whose genes are on scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  the tetraodon protein encoded by the lbx gene on chromosome  <dig>  the stickleback proteins with genes on groups vi and ix and the medaka protein encoded by the gene on chromosome  <dig> 

the second group contained all of the mammalian lbx <dig> proteins, the chicken protein currently known as lbx <dig>  the zebrafish protein so far named lbx <dig> and encoded by the gene on chromosome  <dig>  together with the lbx sequences encoded by genes on fugu scaffold  <dig>  tetraodon chromosome  <dig>  stickleback group iv and medaka scaffold  <dig>  the division into two distinct groups of lbx proteins was supported by high bootstrap values. our phylogenetic analysis shows significantly longer branch lengths for the amniote lbx <dig> proteins, indicating that these lbx <dig> genes have probably evolved at a quicker rate than the lbx <dig> genes. no evidence was found for distinct lbx3/ <dig> proteins.

comparison of genomic lbx loci in osteichthyes
it is generally held that in the lineage leading to jawed vertebrates, two rounds of whole genome duplication occurred, followed by a further genome duplication in the lineage leading to teleosts  <cit> . thus, theoretically, if no gene loss has occurred, four lbx genes should be detectable in extant tetrapods and eight in teleost fish. however, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that only two lbx genes were retained after the second vertebrate genome duplication and before the genome duplication in ray-finned fish. to confirm these results and to further analyse the orthology of the various vertebrate lbx genes, we compared the organisation of genes associated with the vertebrate lbx loci, reasoning that orthologous lbx genes would share a similar chromosomal environment, while paralogous genes would exhibit a distinct arrangement of the locus .

since the human genome information is the most accurate and complete, we began by recording the genes that according to the ncbi map viewer database are located in the environment of human lbx <dig> and  <dig> genes . subsequently, we looked for remnants of the lbx <dig> and  <dig> loci, initially by searching the human genome for paralogues of the genes co-localising with lbx <dig> and  <dig>  we then identified and determined the arrangement of genes characteristic for each of these four paralogons in the genomes of other mammals, the chicken, the frog xenopus tropicalis and the five teleosts .

lbx loci in humans
human lbx <dig> has previously been mapped to chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  mb distant from nkx <dig>   <cit> . lbx <dig> is tightly linked to the related nk-type homeobox gene tlx <dig> . this is followed by the kazal-type serine peptidase inhibitor domain  <dig> gene kazald <dig>  the loxl <dig> gene encoding a lysyl oxidase like protein and the slit <dig> gene encoding an axon guidance molecule. moving in the opposite direction, lbx <dig> is linked to a beta-transducin repeat containing gene , the dna polymerase lambda gene , the deleted in a mouse model of primary ciliary dyskinesia gene , the f-box and wd repeat domain containing  <dig> gene , the fibroblast growth factor  <dig> gene , the nucleophosmin  <dig> gene , the meningioma expressed antigen  <dig> gene , the gene encoding a kv channel interacting protein  <dig> , and further away, the gene encoding the lim domain binding protein ldb <dig> and the nkx <dig>  gene .

human lbx <dig> has been mapped to chromosome  <dig>  and is linked to tlx <dig> . neither of these genes are associated with other nk genes, suggesting that they have translocated from their original cluster  <cit> . lbx <dig> and tlx <dig> are separated by the pcgf <dig> gene, which encodes a polycomb group ring finger. facing away from pcgf <dig> and tlx <dig>  lbx <dig> is linked to genes that encode dynactin subunit  <dig>  and the tetratricopeptide repeat protein  <dig> . tlx <dig> on the other side is flanked by the deaq box  <dig>  gene which encodes for an atp-dependent rna helicase, the gene encoding ancient ubiquitous protein  <dig> , the htra <dig> gene which encodes for a high temperature requiring serine protease, the loxl <dig> gene, dok <dig> which encodes for the docking downstream of tyrosine kinase  <dig> protein, and a gene encoding the uncharacterised protein np <dig> . thus, the human lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> loci are quite distinct . however, they both harbour tlx genes, in line with the idea that lbx and tlx genes were linked in the original bilaterian cluster of nk-type homebox genes  <cit> . moreover, both lbx loci include loxl genes.

in humans, a further tlx gene exists  <dig>  mb distant from nkx <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  thought to be a remnant of the third cluster of nk genes, which, after the second vertebrate genome duplication, lost its cognate lbx gene . investigating the organisation of this former lbx3/tlx <dig> locus, we found that tlx <dig> is on one side linked to the gene that encodes for ran-binding protein  <dig> , the gene encoding for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor , a further kcnip gene, kcnip <dig>  the lymphocyte cytosolic protein gene lcp <dig>  the forkhead transcription factor gene foxi <dig>  the dedicator of cytokinesis gene dock <dig>  the coil-coil domain encoding ccdc <dig> gene, followed by slit <dig>  on the other side, tlx <dig> is linked to nmp <dig>  fgf <dig>  fbxw11/btrc <dig>  and further away from the tlx <dig> gene, nkx <dig> , msx <dig> and dok <dig>  the order of nmp <dig>  fgf <dig> and fbxw11/btrc <dig> is reversed compared to the paralogous genes at the lbx1/tlx <dig> locus. however, it is remarkable that for both the lbx1/tlx <dig> and lbx3/tlx <dig> paralogons, the npm and fgf genes are closely linked, separated by sequences of only  <dig> and  <dig> kb, respectively. taken together, our data suggests that kcnip, fbxw11/btrc <dig>  slit, loxl, dok and the closely associated fgf-npm genes are hallmarks of lbx/tlx loci.

to identify remnants of the fourth lbx locus, we searched the human genome for additional, linked kcnip, btrc/fbxw <dig>  slit, loxl, dok and fgf-npm sequences. no further homologues of btrc/fbxw <dig> genes were identified. however, we found:

- fgf <dig> and npm <dig> closely linked to dok <dig> and about  <dig>  mb distant from loxl <dig>  nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  which also carries nkx <dig> 

- linked kcnip4-slit <dig> genes  <dig>  mb distant from nkx <dig>  on chromosome 4

- kcnip <dig> on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  however  <dig>  mb distant from and hence probably not a genuine part of the lbx2-tlx <dig> region.

a previous report suggested that lbx2/tlx <dig> may once have belonged to the nkx <dig> -nkx <dig>  region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . however, the presence of loxl and dok genes at both the lbx <dig> locus and the nkx <dig> -nkx <dig> locus is not consistent with this idea. kcnip4-slit <dig> were found linked to the prominin gene prom <dig>  so far not associated with lbx/tlx loci. however, as kcnip <dig> is also linked to prom <dig>  this suggests that prom genes may once have belonged to lbx/tlx containing regions. taken together, these observations suggest that the lbx2/tlx <dig> region may have originated from the nkx <dig>  containing cluster on chromosome  <dig>  while fgf17-npm <dig> linked to loxl <dig> and dok <dig> represent the remnants of the fourth lbx/tlx region associated with nkx <dig>  and  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> 

lbx loci in other mammals
investigating the arrangement of genes at lbx loci in additional placental mammals , a marsupial  and a monotreme , we found that the loci are arranged in the same fashion as in humans . the exception is the platypus lbx2/tlx <dig> locus, whose existence could not be confirmed as genes linked to this paralogon in other mammals were found on short, unlinked and poorly characterised dna fragments. moreover, in mouse and monodelphis, prom2-kcnip <dig> are not on the same chromosome as the lbx <dig> locus, supporting the idea that these genes secondarily intercalated into the lbx <dig> carrying chromosome in the lineage leading to humans.

lbx loci in the chicken
as the information on the chicken genome is still fragmentary, the localisation of chicken lbx genes could not be determined with certainty. however, chicken chromosome  <dig> contains a region that is syntenic with the lbx <dig> region on human chromosome  <dig>  encompassing kazald <dig>  tlx <dig>  btrc, poll, dpcd, fbxw <dig>  fgf <dig>  nmp <dig>  mgea <dig> and kcnip <dig> in the same order as the human genes . loxl <dig>  slit <dig> and further genes located in the wider environment of the mammalian lbx <dig> locus were also identified, with gene groups displaying a similar arrangement in the chicken and in mammals . furthermore, we identified sequences  <dig> bp upstream and  <dig>  kb downstream of the two lbx <dig> exons, which are conserved between the mammalian lbx <dig> loci and the putative chicken lbx <dig> site; in the chicken these regions flank a region that has not been fully sequenced yet . thus, it is likely that this area on chromosome  <dig> indeed harbours the lbx <dig> gene. as will become relevant below, in the chicken the btrc <dig> gene is separated from the poll gene by the slc2a <dig> gene  encoding a solute carrier .

the lbx2-type gene so far named lbx <dig>  <cit>  is situated on a short contig not assigned to a chromosome . however, aup <dig>  htra <dig>  loxl <dig>  the gene encoding np <dig> , together with a further mgea gene, were found on the so far poorly-characterised contig  <dig> assigned to chromosome 4; all genes are arranged in the same order as the corresponding genes at the lbx2/tlx <dig> containing region of mammalian chromosomes . moreover, separated by sequence gaps, these genes are linked to the dctn <dig> gene, which is downstream of lbx <dig> in mammals. significantly, this chromosome also carries genes associated with the nkx <dig>  locus in humans, adding weight to the hypothesis that lbx <dig> genes were once associated with this particular nk cluster.

tlx <dig> was found on chicken chromosome  <dig> in a region syntenic with the tlx <dig> containing region of human chromosome  <dig> and grouped with fbxw11/btrc <dig>  fgf <dig>  npm <dig>  ranbp <dig>  gabrp, kcnip <dig>  foxi <dig>  lcp <dig>  dock <dig>  ccdc <dig> and slit <dig> in the same fashion as mammalian tlx <dig>  in agreement with this being the third lbx/tlx paralogon, other members of the nk cluster associated with this paralogon are also found on chick chromosome  <dig> .

finally, a representative of fgf <dig> could not be identified, but npm <dig>  dok <dig> and loxl <dig> were found on chromosome  <dig>  in a region syntenic to the fgf17-npm <dig> region on human chromosome  <dig> and linked to nkx <dig>  and  <dig>  . notably, this region is also linked to prom <dig>  a gene in mammals associated with kcnip <dig> . this finding supports the idea that kcnip3-prom <dig> are not an original component of the lbx2/tlx <dig> paralagon but instead probably belong to the fourth lbx/tlx paralagon.

lbx loci in xenopus tropicalis
in the frog, both lbx <dig> and the kazald <dig>  tlx <dig>  btrc, poll, dpcd, fbxw <dig>  fgf <dig>  nmp <dig>  mgea <dig> and kcnip <dig> genes typical for the amniote lbx <dig> locus were found on scaffold  <dig> . as in the chicken, the slc2a <dig> gene was located between btrc and poll, suggesting that the solute carrier gene was present in the original lbx <dig> locus and was lost from this location in the lineage leading to mammals.

a tlx <dig> gene was found on the scaffold  <dig>  but this scaffold does not contain any further genes associated with lbx/tlx paralagons . similarly, an isolated pcgf <dig> gene was found on scaffold  <dig>  searches for loxl <dig> and aup genes were unsuccessful. thus, the existence of a lbx2/tlx <dig> locus could not be determined. however, linked tlx <dig>  gabrp, kcnip <dig>  foxi, dock <dig> and ccdc <dig> genes were found on scaffold  <dig>  suggesting that a lbx3/tlx <dig> locus exists in frogs .

as in chicken, we did not find a xenopus tropicalis ortholog of fgf <dig>  but we detected npm <dig> and dok <dig> on scaffold  <dig>  linked to each other and arranged in the same order as the corresponding genes surrounding human and chicken npm <dig>  notably, as in amniotes, these genes are also linked to nkx <dig>  . moreover, scaffold  <dig> contains linked loxl <dig>  nkx <dig> , nkx <dig> , prom <dig> and kcnip <dig> genes, which in amniotes, with the exception of prom2-kcnip <dig> that have translocated to a different chromosome in placental mammals, are linked to fgf <dig>  npm <dig>  dok <dig> and nkx <dig>  . taken together, this suggests that all of these genes belong to the same nkx <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  containing cluster.

lbx loci in teleost fish
for teleosts, we expected to find chromosomal arrangements corresponding to that of tetrapods, if, in line with our analysis of lbx proteins, only two lbx bearing loci were present prior to the genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage. alternatively, if in teleosts lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> genes were maintained, they should be embedded in distinct loci, with lbx <dig> next to tlx <dig>  kcnip <dig>  npm <dig>  fgf <dig> and btrc <dig> and/or lbx <dig> near to fgf <dig> and npm <dig> 

we found for the two novel lbx1-type teleost genes that the organisation of their gene loci fell into two classes. the genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  tetraodon scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig> and stickleback group vi are surrounded by tlx <dig> , slc2a <dig>  fbxw <dig> and fgf <dig>  thus bearing the hallmarks of the tetrapod lbx1/tlx <dig> locus . the same arrangement of genes was found on medaka chromosome  <dig>  with a sequence gap at the place where the lbx gene is expected to be. significantly, in all of these teleosts the order of genes is identical to that of the equivalent tetrapod genes, with the exception of an inversion between the tlx <dig> and fgf <dig> region . the lbx genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  tetraodon chromosome  <dig> , fugu scaffold  <dig>  stickleback group ix and medaka chromosome  <dig> are linked to a second slc2a <dig> gene, and to poll, dpcd and a second fgf8-type gene , thus also bearing hallmarks of the tetrapod lbx1/tlx <dig> locus . both stickleback and medaka loci are accompanied by kcnip <dig> and mgea <dig> genes; for stickleback group vi and medaka chromosome  <dig>  these genes are also associated with npm <dig> and slit <dig>  while linked npm3-mgea <dig> genes were found on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  moreover, all of the teleost lbx1-type loci are associated with gene groups found in the wider environment of lbx <dig> loci in amniotes . taken together, these findings support the idea that all of these fish have two lbx1/tlx <dig> paralogons, although in many cases there has been reciprocal gene loss following the teleost-specific whole genome duplication

for the third of the teleost lbx genes, namely the gene currently known as zebrafish lbx <dig> on chromosome  <dig> and the lbx genes on tetraodon chromosome  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig>  stickleback group iv and medaka scaffold  <dig>  we found an environment reminiscent of the mammalian lbx <dig> locus, with the lbx genes being separated from a tlx gene by pcgf <dig> . the exception is the medaka scaffold  <dig>  which is a short fragment that only contains the lbx and pcgf genes. different from that of mammals, an fgf24-npm <dig> gene set was found between the lbx and tlx genes. in the wider environment of the lbx-pcgf1-fgf24-npm4-tlx gene set, we found two types of arrangement . on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  the genes are associated with aup <dig> and loxl <dig>  reminiscent of the mammalian lbx2/tlx <dig> paralagon. the genes on fugu scaffold  <dig>  tetraodon chromosome  <dig> and stickleback group iv, are associated with nanos <dig>  limch <dig>  phox2b, tmem <dig>  bbs <dig>  anxa <dig>  fgfbp, prom <dig>  tapt <dig>  ldb <dig>  and adad <dig>  spata <dig>  ankrd <dig>  leprot <dig>  srp <dig>  arl <dig>  hop, sec24b ; the ultracontigs  <dig> and  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> of medaka harbour the same genes in the same order. notably, the genes surrounding the lbx-pcgf-fgf-npm-tlx group in fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka are also found on zebrafish chromsome  <dig>  while aup <dig> is found on stickleback group iv and medaka chromosome  <dig> , i.e. all of these genes were located in the wider environment of the lbx-pcgf-fgf-npm-tlx locus. taken together, our data suggest that, despite substantial gene rearrangements, these chromosomal regions in teleosts are lbx2/tlx <dig> paralogons. interestingly, the genes closely associated with fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka lbx <dig>  including the fgfbp-prom1-tapt1-ldb2-anxa <dig> genes, are linked with the nkx <dig>  locus on human chromosome  <dig> and chicken chromosome  <dig>  consistent with our proposal that the mammalian lbx <dig> genes were originally part of the nkx <dig>  cluster .

searching for remnants of the second teleost lbx <dig> paralagon, we found loxl <dig>  a further nanos <dig> gene and ttc <dig> on tetraodon chromosome  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig>  stickleback group xv and medaka chromosome  <dig>  dok1-np <dig> -sema4f genes were found on tetraodon scaffold  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig>  stickleback group vii and medaka chromosome 18; in stickleback and medaka these genes were also linked to kcnip4-gba3-gpr <dig>  which in tetrapods co-localise with nkx <dig>  . finally, at a distance from the second lbx <dig> locus on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  tetraodon chromosome  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig>  stickleback group ix and medaka chromosome  <dig>  we found slit <dig> and a second group of fgfbp-prom1-tapt1-anxa <dig> genes linked to fbxw <dig>  which in humans are all associated with the lbx <dig> locus. thus, it seems that the second teleost lbx <dig> paralagon has dispersed, with parts having translocated to one of the lbx <dig> carrying chromosomes.

for tlx <dig> genes, two types of arrangements were identified . on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig>  tetraodon chromosome  <dig>  stickleback group iv and medaka chromosome  <dig>  i.e. inserted into the lbx <dig> containing chromosome, tlx <dig> is on one side linked to kcnip <dig>  and on the other linked to the hrh <dig> gene encoding a histamine receptor, dock <dig> and, slightly more distant, fgf <dig> and fbxw <dig>  on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  fugu scaffold  <dig>  tetraodon chromosome  <dig>  stickleback group vii and medaka chromosome  <dig>  hrh <dig> is linked with kncip <dig>  npm <dig> and in the case of zebrafish, tlx3b, fgf <dig> and fbxw <dig>  suggesting that remnants of the two tlx <dig> loci created by the teleost-specific genome duplication still exist.

finally, searching for additional btrc, prom, loxl, slit, dok, kcnip, and fgf-npm genes as indicators of other possible lbx/tlx paralogons, we identified linked npm2-dok2-fgf <dig> genes on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  linked fgf17-loxl2-kcnip <dig> genes on stickleback group xiii, and linked kcnip3-loxl2-dok <dig> genes on tetraodon chromosome  <dig> and medaka chromosome  <dig>  a second set of linked kcnip3-loxl2-dok <dig> genes was identified on zebrafish chromosome  <dig> and a second set of loxl <dig> and kcnip <dig> genes in a conserved environment but split between two chromosomes were also identified for the other four fish species. notably, additional genes were also identified that co-localise with loxl <dig>  dok <dig>  kcnip <dig>  fgf <dig> and npm <dig> genes both in teleosts and tetrapods, including orthologs of nkx <dig>  , supporting the idea that all these genes once belonged to the same locus, which in tetrapods still encompasses nkx  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> .

phylogenetic relationship of signature genes for lbx/tlx paralogons
characterising lbx/tlx loci in tetrapods, we found evidence for three distinct paralogons, with the possibility of fgf17-npm <dig> representing the remnant of the fourth. in teleosts, the arrangement of lbx1/tlx <dig> and tlx <dig> genes closely follows the pattern observed in tetrapods. however, the putative teleost lbx2/tlx <dig> paralogon  includes additional fgf-npm genes. moreover, all of the teleosts except zebrafish show a somewhat divergent organisation of genes in the chromosomal regions surrounding the lbx2/tlx <dig> loci. furthermore, the duplicate lbx <dig> paralogon and the two fgf17-npm <dig> paralogons are poorly preserved in teleosts. therefore, to further confirm the evolutionary relationship of the lbx loci and our assignment of genes to specific paralogons, we carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences encoded by the genes in the various lbx/tlx regions. for this, we blast-searched sequence databases for related sequences and built phylogenetic trees which included various invertebrate outgroups .

phylogenetic relationship of genes co-localising with several lbx paralogons
btrc/fbxw <dig>  mgea, kazald, ldb and prom genes occurred at two, tlx, loxl, slit and dok genes at three and kcnip, and the linked fgf-npm genes at four putative lbx loci in tetrapods. if our assignment of lbx/tlx paralogons is correct, then the genes that we have assigned to particular paralogons should group together. in addition, if the fundamental lay-out of lbx/tlx paralogons was established in vertebrates before the divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish and the additional genome duplication in the ray-finned fish lineage, then the teleost protein sequences should group with the tetrapod proteins. if, however, distinct lbx/tlx loci were maintained in the lineage leading to lobe-finned fish/tetrapods and ray-finned fish/teleosts, then our phylogenetic analysis should reveal additional groups of genes.

with the exception of dok <dig> sequences, which seem to have become highly diverged, all of our analyses supported our assignment of the different lbx/tlx paralogons . notably, our analyses of ldb and prom <dig> genes also support our model that the tetrapod lbx <dig> loci was originally located in the nkx <dig>  containing cluster: the ldb <dig> sequences, which are associated with lbx <dig> in teleosts and with the now lbx-less locus carrying nkx <dig>  in tetrapods group together, as do the prom <dig> genes which are linked to ldb2-tapt-anxa <dig> genes and hence, to the current plus the dispersed lbx <dig> and nkx <dig>  loci . in addition, our analyses of prom <dig>  tlx, kcnip, fgf and npn genes shows that orthologues associated with the lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> paralogons are more closely related to each other than to orthologues associated with the lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> paralogons and vice versa. this is most informative for the genes where four paralogues are still linked to potential lbx loci in extant vertebrates . in these cases, we found that kcnip <dig> and kcnip <dig> genes are more closely related to each other than to kcnip <dig> and  <dig>  similarly, fgf <dig> sequences are closely related to fgf <dig> sequences, and fgf <dig> sequences are closely related to fgf <dig>  finally, the npm3-npm <dig> and npm4-npm <dig> sequences are more closely related to each other, respectively . taken together, this suggests that the lbx1/ <dig> paralogons and the lbx2/ <dig> paralagons arose from different ancestral lbx loci generated during the first vertebrate genome duplication.

discussion
ladybird/lbx genes are crucial regulators of metazoan neural and muscle cell specification  <cit> . yet before this study, it was difficult to evaluate the basic role of lbx genes in vertebrate development and evolution, as it was unclear exactly how many lbx genes exist in different vertebrates and how these genes are phylogenetically related to each other. the 2r hypothesis predicts that early in the vertebrate lineage, four ohnologs were generated for each gene in the genome; for teleosts, descendants of ray-finned fish, a further genome duplication should have produced eight gene copies  <cit> . however four ohnologs are seldom found in vertebrate genomes, suggesting that gene loss has played an important part in genome evolution. in recent years, two lbx genes were identified in amniotes, one in frogs and one in the teleost danio rerio  <cit> . one of the amniote lbx genes and the lbx genes identified in frog and zebrafish had been reported to be lbx <dig> genes, while the second of the amniote lbx genes had been suggested to represent distinct lbx <dig>  and lbx <dig> genes  with rather divergent expression and function  <cit> . this suggested that lbx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were retained in amniotes up to the split of mammalian and avian lineages, while despite their additional genome duplication ray-finned fish seemed to have experienced a near-complete extinction of lbx genes. however, previous lbx gene assignments were sometimes based on limited sequence comparisons, and neither a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis nor a comparative genomic analysis of vertebrate lbx genes had been carried out. therefore, it remained unclear whether more lbx genes had yet to be found and whether these genes were survivors of lbx <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> genes.

in this study, we searched vertebrate sequence databases for lbx genes and determined their phylogenetic relationships. moreover, we investigated the organisation of lbx gene loci, identified signature genes linked to these loci and established the phylogenetic relationships of these genes. our study confirms the existence of two lbx genes in amniotes, while only one lbx gene was found, thus far, in xenopus tropicalis. however, we were able to detect novel lbx genes in teleosts. yet, we found no species with the predicted set of four  or eight  lbx genes. thus, in all bony vertebrates, some lbx genes have been lost. nevertheless, tracing the signature genes linked to different lbx loci, we were able to identify remnants of all four lbx paralogons in tetrapods and all eight lbx paralogons in teleosts. however, only lbx <dig> and lbx2-type loci retained lbx genes; no evidence for surviving lbx <dig> or lbx <dig> genes was found. with cognate tetrapod and fish paralogons displaying a high degree of similarity, this suggests that lbx <dig> and  <dig> genes were lost before the split of the lobe-finned and ray-finned fish lineages. finally, our phylogenetic and synteny analyses revealed that lbx-associated genes in lbx1-lbx <dig> paralogons and in lbx2-lbx <dig> paralogons, respectively, are more closely related. this suggests that lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> paralogons originated from one, and lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> paralogons from the other, parental paralogon generated during the first round of vertebrate genome duplication.

two novel lbx genes were identified in teleosts
our searches of genomic databases identified two novel lbx genes in zebrafish, and three lbx genes in takifugu rubripes , tetraodon nigroviridis and gasterosteus aculeatus . oryzias latipes  carries two lbx genes, with a sequence gap at the expected position of the third. taken together, this suggests that teleosts share the same set of  <dig> lbx genes.

phylogenetic analyses grouped the two novel zebrafish lbx proteins, two of the three fugu, tetraodon and stickleback proteins and one of the medaka proteins with the tetrapod lbx <dig> sequences. conversely, the zebrafish protein currently known as lbx <dig>  the remaining fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka sequences and the chicken protein so far called lbx <dig> all grouped with the mammalian lbx <dig> sequences. the bipartite separation of lbx sequences was supported by high bootstrap values, suggesting that in all extant osteichthyes, only lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> type genes were maintained, with teleosts harbouring duplicates of lbx <dig> 

traces of four lbx loci were identified in tetrapods
prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication, the nk clusters broke up and non-nk genes were acquired by these loci . our analysis shows that tetrapod lbx <dig> is invariantly linked to tlx <dig>  kazald <dig>  btrc, slc2a <dig>  poll, dpcd, fbxw <dig>  fgf <dig>  npm <dig>  mgea <dig>  kcnip <dig>  ldb, loxl <dig> and slit <dig> with slc2a <dig> being lost in mammals. the assignment of lbx2-type genes was more problematic, due to incomplete sequence information for chicken and frog. for mammals however, lbx <dig> was found linked to tlx <dig>  pcgf <dig>  aup <dig>  loxl <dig> and dok <dig>  and linked loxl and aup genes were also identified for chicken .

* in human, cattle, dog, prom2-kcnip <dig> are on the same chromosome but at a distance to lbx <dig> 

note, genes occurring at single lbx/tlx loci form monophyletic trees, i.e. the loci in fish and tetrapods are related . genes at more than one locus: gene phylogeny matches genomic localisation and environment . genes at the putative lbx4-tlx <dig> locus, characterised amongst others by fgf17-npm <dig>  match between fish and tetrapods. genes found associated with lbx <dig> loci in fish match genes in amniotes distributed between the lbx <dig> locus and the lbx-free nkx <dig>  locus, suggesting that the amniote lbx <dig> locus once belonged to the nkx <dig>  containing nk cluster. genes in bold: genes that supported by high bootstrap values are more related to each other than to other paralogues, suggesting that the lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> loci evolved from one and the lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> from the other of the paralogons generated during the first round of vertebrate genome duplication.

the linking of lbx with tlx genes was not unexpected, given its maintenance in the otherwise fragmented amphioxus nk cluster  <cit> . yet tetrapods harbour a third tlx gene, suggesting that a third, previously lbx3-containing paralogon still exists  <cit> . indeed, tetrapod tlx <dig> sequences form a phylogenetic group distinct from tlx <dig> and tlx <dig> sequences, supporting the idea that this gene did not arise from a single gene duplication event. moreover, tlx <dig> loci share the same organisation amongst tetrapods and encompass btrc <dig>  fgf <dig>  npm <dig>  kcnip <dig>  and slit <dig>  which according to our phylogenetic analysis are paralogues of the genes found at the lbx <dig> site. thus, while lbx <dig> itself was lost from the tlx <dig> locus, a number of genes that must have been acquired by the nk cluster prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication are still present.

using the previously identified signature genes linked to the lbx/tlx loci as query sequences, we also identified remnants of the fourth lbx paralogon. interestingly, both the lbx1/tlx <dig> and the tlx <dig> locus contain closely linked fgf-npm genes, and an additional pair of tightly linked fgf-npm genes, namely fgf <dig> and npm <dig>  was found in mammals, linked to dok <dig>  loxl <dig>  nkx <dig>  and  <dig> . linked loxl2-dok2-npm <dig> sequences were also found in the chicken genome, and in the frog, linked dok2-npm <dig> genes and loxl2-nkx <dig> -nkx <dig>  genes were found on two, possibly neighbouring scaffolds. in some tetrapods the loxl2-nkx <dig> -nkx <dig>  genes were also linked to prom <dig> and kcnip <dig>  this suggests that prom2-kcnip <dig> initially belonged to the fourth lbx paralogon that contains fgf17-npm <dig> as well as dok2-loxl2-nkx <dig> -nkx <dig>  genes, while the placement of prom2-kcnip <dig> on the same chromosome but at a distance to lbx <dig> in humans, cattle and dog  is probably a result of a more recent transposition event. in summary, presence of a number of signature genes for lbx loci linked to nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig>  suggests that this region is the ancestral home of the lost lbx4-tlx <dig> genes.

duplicates of the four tetrapod-type lbx loci were identified in teleosts, with two lbx <dig> genes and one lbx <dig> gene still present
in teleosts, the two novel, putative lbx <dig> genes were found in two types of genomic settings, both of which contained signature genes for the tetrapod lbx <dig> locus. genes that occurred at only one of the novel teleost lbx sites formed monophyletic groups with their tetrapod counterparts. importantly, slc2a <dig> and fgf <dig> genes, which were found at both of the teleost loci as well as the tetrapod lbx <dig> sites, also formed single groups, indicating that the two novel lbx loci in teleosts arose from a common lbx1-containing ancestor. consequently, tetrapod lbx <dig> genes and the two novel teleost lbx genes are orthologs.

similar to the lbx <dig> paralogons, the relationship of the now lbx-less tlx <dig> loci could readily be established. teleosts harbour one locus containing slit <dig>  kcnip <dig>  tlx <dig>  fgf <dig> and btrc <dig> genes in the same order as found at the tetrapod tlx <dig> site, with the exception of tetraodon whose slit <dig> gene intercalated between kcnip <dig> and fgf <dig>  notably, this tlx <dig> locus is found on the same chromosome, but with different integration sites, as the gene we propose to rename lbx <dig>  suggesting extensive transposition between lbx/tlx loci in teleosts. the second tlx <dig> locus contains kcnip1-npm <dig> and in zebrafish also tlx3b, plus a second copy of fgf <dig> and btrc <dig>  further shared genes were found in the environment of the tetrapod and teleost tlx <dig> loci; genes at these sites, including the tlx genes themselves, grouped together in our phylogenetic analyses. this suggests that teleost tlx <dig> and tlx3b are orthologs of the tetrapod tlx <dig> genes. the high degree of locus conservation also suggests that the basic lay out of this tlx <dig> paralogon, including the elimination of lbx <dig>  was established prior to the teleost-specific genome duplication.

in the zebrafish, the gene currently known as lbx <dig> but placed with mammalian lbx <dig> in our phylogenetic analyses was found in a genomic environment bearing the hallmarks of the mammalian lbx <dig> locus, being linked with pcgf <dig>  a tlx gene currently named tlx3a, aup <dig> and loxl <dig>  these genes formed monophyletic groups with the cognate genes at the mammalian lbx <dig> locus, with teleost tlx3a grouping with mammalian tlx <dig>  this suggests that this locus is indeed a lbx <dig> paralogon. in fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka, the third lbx gene was also linked to pcgf <dig> and a tlx2-type gene, although aup was located at a distance or in case of tetraodon, on a different chromosome. the latter seems to be a result of a secondary rearrangement of the locus, as aup is linked to lbx in amphioxus and hence, was part of lbx loci before the split of cephalochordate-vertebrate lineages . nevertheless, all of the teleost lbx <dig> loci encompassed a fgf24-npm <dig> set between pcgf <dig> and tlx <dig>  moreover, genes associated with prom <dig> and directly linked to fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka lbx <dig> were found in the same order in the wider environment of the zebrafish lbx-pcgf1-tlx set. phylogenetic analyses indicated that these genes are orthologs, suggesting that the teleost lbx <dig> loci are variations on the same theme.

in fugu, tetraodon, stickleback and medaka, the lbx <dig> gene was directly adjacent to nanos <dig>  which is not linked to the mammalian lbx <dig> gene. in mammals on the other side, the lbx2-pcgf1-tlx <dig> set was flanked by ttc <dig> and loxl3-dok1-np <dig> -sema4f. yet in these four teleosts, a second nanos <dig> gene was identified, linked to loxl <dig>  dok <dig>  np <dig> , sema4f and ttc <dig>  moreover, a duplicate of the prom1-linked gene set was found at the same site. a similar arrangement of genes was also detected in the zebrafish, distributed however between two chromosomes and with individual genes missing from the set. phylogenetic analyses grouped the genes with the cognate genes at the mammalian and teleost lbx2-bearing sites, suggesting that this location is the second, now lbx2/tlx2-less lbx <dig> paralogon in teleosts. as will become relevant below, this locus encompassed slit <dig>  kcnip <dig> and fbxw <dig>  associated with the lbx-free nkx <dig>  locus in tetrapods.

establishing whether teleosts carry duplicates of the possible fourth lbx paralogon was more problematic as unfortunately, some of the genes suggestive of this paralogon  reside on rather small scaffolds and hence, linkage could not always be established. however, all five teleosts harboured two sets of loxl2-kcnip <dig> genes. one of the sets was associated with dok <dig> and in stickleback, also with fgf <dig>  moreover, npm2-dok2-fgf <dig> were found together on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  phylogenetic analyses grouped fgf <dig>  npm <dig>  loxl <dig>  kcnip <dig> genes with their namesakes from tetrapod genomes. this suggests that, although less well preserved, two copies of the putative fourth lbx paralogon still exist in extant teleosts.

the mammalian lbx <dig> locus has translocated from the nk cluster containing nkx <dig> 
previous studies of human nk genes showed that remnants of two nk clusters have been preserved, with chromosome  <dig> carrying lbx <dig> and tlx <dig> linked to nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig> , and chromosome  <dig> carrying tlx <dig> linked to nkx <dig>   <cit> . more partial remnants of two further nk clusters have also been identified, one on chromosome  <dig> with nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig>  and one on chromosome  <dig> with nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig> . however, no lbx or tlx genes are linked to these regions.

a previous study, based primarily on the human genome, proposed that the nkx <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  paralogon  might be the ancestral location of lbx <dig> and tlx <dig>   <cit> . by a process of elimination, this would further suggest that lbx <dig> and tlx <dig> were lost from the nkx <dig>  paralogon . consistent with this hypothesis, paralogs of a few genes  are represented at both the lbx <dig> and the nk <dig>  loci in mammals, suggesting that these two loci have derived from separate lbx/tlx paralogons. however, phylogenetic analysis of these gene families shows that the mammalian genes linked to the lbx <dig> loci group with frog, chicken and/or teleost genes associated with fgf <dig> and npm <dig> loci . this suggests that these genes may have translocated to the mammalian lbx <dig> loci from the putative 4th lbx/tlx paralogon .

consistent with this second interpretation our data suggests that the ancestral location of the lbx2/tlx <dig> paralogon now located on human chromosome  <dig> was the nkx <dig>  paralogon on human chromosome  <dig> . the evidence for this is several fold. firstly, we have identified four distinct fgf and npm genes, with fgf8-npm <dig> demarcating lbx1/tlx <dig> loci, fgf18-npm <dig> the tlx <dig> loci, fgf24-npm <dig> the preserved teleost lbx2/tlx <dig> locus and fgf17-npm <dig> genes associated with tetrapod and teleost nkx <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  genes. secondly, paralogous loxl and dok genes are present at both the lbx <dig> locus and the nkx <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  locus, suggesting that these two loci have evolved from different paralogons. thirdly, amniote orthologs of genes associated with the two teleost lbx <dig> loci such as fbxw <dig>  ldb <dig>  prom <dig>  slit <dig> and kcnip <dig> co-localise with nkx <dig> , and these amniote and teleost genes fall into the same phylogenetic groups. fourthly, the lbx <dig> locus is still associated with nkx <dig>  genes in teleosts, and possibly, also in the chicken . all together, this strongly suggests that the mammalian lbx2-tlx <dig> locus was once located in the nk cluster containing nkx <dig>  and that lbx <dig> and tlx <dig> were lost from the nkx <dig> - <dig> - <dig>  paralogon that contains fgf <dig> and npm <dig> 

lbx4-tlx <dig> were lost prior to the third genome duplication in ray-finned fish
if the assignment of lbx2-tlx <dig> to the nkx <dig>  carrying nk cluster is correct then, as discussed above, the nk cluster containing nkx <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   is the former location of the lbx4-tlx <dig> paralogon. this idea is supported by the presence of a number of signature genes for lbx loci at this site. moreover, genes at this locus do not group with paralogues accompanying other lbx loci; most notably, the fgf-npm and kcnip genes located here constitute distinct phylogenetic groups. taken together, this suggests that different to lbx2-tlx <dig> genes, lbx4-tlx <dig> genes did not translocate to another chromosome. rather, they were lost from this fourth nk cluster. significantly, both teleosts and tetrapods retained a similar set of genes from this locus. this indicates that the basic lay-out of the paralogon, including the elimination of its lbx and tlx genes, was probably established in an ancestor of the osteichthyes .

lbx loci in extant vertebrates arose from lbx1/ <dig> and lbx2/ <dig> precursors
our study shows that of the genes associated with lbx-tlx loci, fgf, npm and kcnip genes still exist in four copies, inferring that indeed, the original chordate locus was duplicated twice in the lineage leading to vertebrates. phylogenetic analyses indicated that fgf <dig> genes found in the lbx1/tlx <dig> paralogon and fgf <dig>  found in the lbx4/tlx <dig> paralogon, are more closely related than fgf <dig> found in the intact teleost lbx2/tlx <dig> paralogon and fgf <dig> found in the lbx3/tlx <dig> paralogon. similarly, npm <dig>  and npm <dig>  are closely related to each other, distinguished from npm <dig>  and npm <dig> , a similar grouping was found for kcnip genes, with kcnip <dig>  and kcnip <dig>  being the most closely related. this pair-wise grouping is supported by high bootstrap values and suggests that during the second vertebrate genome duplication, lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> paralogons arose from one of the lbx-tlx loci generated by the initial duplication event and lbx <dig> and lbx <dig> paralogons arose from the other duplicated locus. consistent with this model, tlx <dig> and tlx <dig> genes are rather similar and are easily distinguished from the tlx <dig> genes associated with lbx <dig> 

basic roles of lbx <dig> genes and neofunctionalisation of mammalian lbx <dig> genes
our analysis shows that the organisation of orthologous lbx/tlx paralogons is very similar in extant bony vertebrates, suggesting that the main compositions of the paralogons were established before the divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish. this infers that osteichthyes had only two types of lbx genes. expression analyses and functional studies on lbx <dig> type genes suggest that they all play a role in dorsal spinal cord and muscle development  <cit> . interestingly, the zebrafish and chicken lbx <dig> genes are still expressed in muscle precursors, and zebrafish lbx <dig> is also expressed in the spinal cord  <cit> . in contrast, mouse lbx <dig> is not expressed in these regions, rather labelling the urogenital system, eye and brain  <cit> . amniote lbx <dig> proteins also show the most divergent sequences. this suggests that amniote  lbx <dig> genes have evolved at a faster rate than their anamniote  orthologs, and undergone neofunctionalisation. other lbx <dig> genes, however, may have retained aspects of ancestral lbx expression and function, which seems to be tied to the formation of specific neural and muscle cell types.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified remnants of all four lbx/tlx paralogons in extant bony vertebrates. phylogenetic analyses of lbx, tlx and non-nk genes at these loci revealed that the first round of whole genome duplication in vertebrates created the ancestor of the lbx1/tlx <dig> and lbx4/tlx <dig> paralogons and the ancestor of the lbx2/tlx <dig> and lbx3/tlx <dig> paralogons . after the second genome duplication, lbx and tlx genes were lost, such that before the split of the ray-finned fish/teleost and lobe-finned fish/tetrapod lineages only lbx1/tlx <dig>  lbx2/tlx <dig> and tlx <dig> genes were maintained. in the ray-finned fish lineage, genome duplication and subsequent gene loss left teleosts with two lbx <dig>  one lbx <dig> and two tlx <dig> loci. since the amniote lbx <dig> genes show divergent amino acid sequences and expression patterns, we propose that these lbx <dig> genes have been evolving at a faster rate and were subject to neofunctionalisation. lbx <dig> genes on the other hand may have retained more features of the original chordate lbx gene.
