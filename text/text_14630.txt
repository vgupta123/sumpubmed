BACKGROUND
an adaptive immune response protects an organism from the infection by identifying and killing pathogens  <cit> . it is antigen-specific and allows for a stronger immune response after the recognition of specific "non-self" antigens by the t-cell receptor   <cit> . as an increasing number of high-throughput experiments providing available and reliable binding epitopes related to various tcrs  <cit> , a systematic and fast method to search similar complexes  is an important task for understanding potential immune interactions and developing pathogen vaccines.

since rapidly increasing three-dimensional structure complexes in protein data bank , many structure-based works have been proposed to utilize physical interacting interfaces of these complexes to study protein-protein interactions  <cit> , mhc-peptide interactions  <cit> , and structural systems biology  <cit> . most of these works  <cit>  used a scoring-based matrix to evaluate the protein-protein and mhc-peptide interface preferences. in addition, sequence-based matrix methods  have been proposed for predicting peptide-mhc interactions.

recently, we have proposed a template-based strategy, called pacomplex  <cit> , which is the first method investigating both peptide-mhc and peptide-tcr interfaces to infer peptide antigens and homologous peptide antigens of a query. this study utilized four scoring matrices and one scoring matrix to calculate the binding scores of peptide-mhc ) and tcr-peptide   <cit> ) interfaces, respectively. our previous works showed that four scoring matrices yielded significantly higher accuracies than one scoring matrix for inferring structure-based ppis  <cit> . the four scoring matrices include sidechain-sidechain and sidechain-backbone van der waals energies; and sidechain-sidechain and sidechain-backbone hydrogen-bond energies. in addition, two main factors that deteriorate the performance of pacomplex using one-matrix scores are  the hydrogen-bond energies and van der waals interactions were considered as the same and  the sidechain-sidechain and sidechain-backbone interactions were not discriminated. for example, we observed that the average experimental energies of the residues forming hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, based on  <dig> mutated residues on ag-ab interfaces.

to address these issues, we proposed four-matrices scoring function to enhance one-matrix scoring function to infer the peptide antigens using tcr-pmhc complex structures. the major enhancements are as follows: 1) four scoring matrices  can predict template-based binding energies of tcr to pmhc interfaces by separating the van der waals  forces from special bonding forces; 2) imatrix discriminates sidechain-sidechain and sidechain-backbone interactions into two matrices; 3) a fast and genomic-scale searching method for identifying peptide antigens of a template tcr-pmhc structure; 4) imatrix highlights the critical hydrogen bonds for key interacting residues between tcr-pmhc compexes.

to validate the reliability and enlarge the number of potential antigens, we evaluate our methods on experimental free energy data and  <dig> complete pathogen genomes. experimental results indicated that imatrix can achieve a high correlation of the binding interface energies. in addition, the homologous peptide antigens derived from imatrix have a high precision value and keep the hydrogen bonds based on template then they should be the reliable peptide antigens. the imatrix also reveals detailed interacting models for tcr-pmhc complexes distinctively and display the mechanisms of crucial binding regions. furthermore, the imatrix scoring function can provide important insights into heightened immunogenicity derived from the potential peptide antigens or epitopes and can infer valuable vaccine design for clinical trials.

methods
overview for genome-wide structural modelling of tcr-pmhc interactions
according to our previous study, the homologous peptide antigen  of the peptide  in template complex as follows:  p and p' can be bound by the same mhc forming pmhc and p'mhc, respectively, with the significant interface similarity ;  pmhc and p'mhc can be recognized by the same tcr with significant peptide-tcr interface similarity ; and  tcr-pmhc and tcr-p'mhc share significant complex similarity . the joint z-value  is defined as

  jz=zmhc×ztcr 

here, jz ≥  <dig>  is considered a significant similarity according to the statistical analysis of  <dig> tcr-pmhc structure complexes ;  <dig>  experimental peptide antigens; and ≥  <dig> peptide candidates derived from  <dig>  protein sequences in  <dig> pathogens.

scoring function and imatrix
we have recently proposed a template-based scoring function to determine the protein-protein interactions  derived from a 3d-dimer structure  <cit> . for the peptide-mhc and peptide-tcr interaction, the scoring function is defined as

  etotal=evdw+esf+esim 

where evdw is the van der waal's energy; esf is the special energy ; and esim refers to the peptide similarity score between query and template. in pacomplex, the evdw and esf of peptide-tcr interfaces are calculated by the one-matrix . however, the evdw and esf of peptide-mhc and peptide-tcr interfaces are calculated by the four matrices of ppi and imatrix, respectively, in this study. the evdw and esf are given as

  evdw= ∑i,jcp 

  esf= ∑i,jcp 

where cp denotes the number of the aligned-contact residues of query peptide and the hit template peptide. vssij and vsbij  are the sidechain to sidechain and sidechain to backbone vdw energies between residues i  and j , respectively. sfssij and sfsbij  are the sidechain to sidechain and sidechain to backbone special interacting energies between residue i  and j , respectively, if the contact-pair residues i and j form the special bonds  in the template structure. the vdw energies  and special interacting energies  of peptide-mhc and peptide-tcr can be obtained from ppi matrices  and imatrix , including sidechain-sidechain  and sidechain-backbone van der waals scoring matrices ; and sidechain-sidechain  and sidechain-backbone special-bond scoring matrices . the sidechain-sidechain scoring matrices are symmetric and sidechain-backbone scoring matrices are non-symmetric.

following calculation of the interaction scores , these scores are transformed into z-values  of peptide-mhc and peptide-tcr interfaces using the mean and standard deviation derived from  <dig>  random interfaces by mutating each peptide position. for a tcr-pmhc template collected from the protein data bank   <cit> , these  <dig>  random interfaces are generated by substituting with another amino acid according to the amino acid composition derived from uniprot  <cit> . finally, we computed jz  of the tcr-pmhc complex.

data set of constructing imatrix
because of the different properties between protein-protein and tcr-pmhc interfaces, the scoring matrices for describing ppis  <cit>  are unsuitable for modelling tcr-pmhc. for modelling tcr-pmhc interactions, we collected a great quantity of co-crystal structures of tcr-pmhc complexes which were only  <dig> mhc class i and  <dig> mhc class ii in pdb . in addition, these sequences and structures are often very similar. conversely, the number and sequences of co-crystal antigen-antibody  structures are significantly large and diverse, respectively. according to the comparison between ag-ab and tcr-pmhc interfaces , the tcrs and fab fragments of antibodies often share similar structures on the binding sites )  <cit> .

therefore, we built a dataset, consists of  <dig> ag-ab interactions, to generate the imatrix for modelling tcr-pmhc interfaces . we first manually collected  <dig> crystal structures of ag-ab complexes from the pdb  at a resolution less than or equal to 3Å. the binding interfaces consist of one protein antigen and one antibody whose fragments outside of variable regions are excluded from the analysis. all protein chains were pairwise aligned to make non-redundant sequence set using blastclust  <cit> . finally, the  <dig> ag-ab complexes  with  <dig> ag-ab interfaces  were collected in this set.

experimental free energy dataset
to further investigate the relationship between the predicted energy and experimental free energy, we collected  <dig> mutated residues, which are contact residues in ag-ab interfaces in  <dig> structural complexes from the asedb . the alanine scanning energetics database is a repository for energetics of sidechain interactions determined by alanine-scanning mutagenesis  <cit> . asedb gives the corresponding ΔΔg value representing the change in free energy of binding upon mutation to alanine for each experimentally mutated residue.

the experimental peptide antigens derived from iedb
to further evaluate the reliability of homologous peptide antigen derived from the imatrix, we collected the  <dig>  experimental peptides from the iedb  for  <dig> pathogens; and  <dig> tcr-pmhc complexes  from the pdb. then, we filtered  <dig>  positive nonamers and  <dig>  negative nonamers of tcr-peptide-hla-a <dig>  here, the definition of positive records is at least one positive measurement in t cell response or mhc binding assays; negative records are data with only negative measurements. we also prepared the h-2-kb  and h-2-ld  alleles for validation of imatrix.

in addition, in these  <dig> pathogens, the vaccinia virus has the largest amount  of experimental records in the iedb, including  <dig>  positive nonamers and  <dig> negative nonamers. here, the complete genomes of vaccinia virus are  <dig> proteins recorded in uniprot  <cit> , and we processed them into  <dig>  nonamers . this vaccinia virus subset was used in case studies.

RESULTS
imatrix
the high scores in four scoring matrices of imatrix are often superior frequency of interacting residue pairs. the sidechain-sidechain scoring matrices are symmetric. in sidechain-backbone matrices , y-axis denotes side chain and x-axis denotes backbone. the interacting score is set to zero if the frequency of an entry  is  <dig> 

for vdw scoring matrices of imatrix , the scores are high when aromatic residues  interact to aromatic and large-sidechain residues . the result is consistent to the previous results that residues tyr and trp play key roles in epitopes and paratopes  <cit> . conversely, the result is different from the vdw matrices of protein-protein interactions  <cit> , which the aromatic residues only prefer interacting aromatic residues . additionally, the scores are low while aliphatic residues  interact to the other residues  for immune complexes. the results are significantly different from the vdw matrices of protein-protein interfaces .

for special-bond scoring matrices , the scores  are significantly high when the residues with polar groups  or basic residues  interact to acidic residues . these results are consistent to the results of protein-protein interfaces .

tcr-pmhc interfaces
based on our previous researches, the template-based scoring function achieves good agreement for the binding affinity in ppis  <cit> . the novel knowledge-based matrices were derived using a general mathematical structure  <cit>  from a non-redundant set of  <dig> 3d-dimer complexes proposed by glaser et al.  <cit> . this dataset is composed of  <dig> heterodimers and  <dig> homodimers and the sequence identity is less than 30% to each other. however, the matrices may not be applied to model tcr-peptide binding because previous studies have indicated that the tcr-pmhc interface resembles ag-ab interactions  <cit> . we compared the tcr-pmhc, ag-ab, and protein-protein interfaces and presented our observations in global and local views. the tcr-pmhc and ag-ab co-crystal complexes were collected from the pdb , including  <dig> and  <dig> non-redundant interfaces, respectively. ppis set derived from  <dig> non-redundant interfaces  <cit> .

amino acid preferences
to display an overall measure of the interaction frequencies of each amino acid with all the residues of the complementary interface, we calculated the preferences of amino acids in three kinds of interfaces, including tcr-pmhc, ag-ab, and protein-protein interfaces. the preference  of the amino acid type i in the molecular interfaces can be calculated by equation :

  pi=ii∑120ii 

where ii represnts the numbers of the amino acid type i in the interfaces. next, we derived the interfaces similarity by pairwise comparison using the pearson's correlation coefficient . the pcc of  <dig> amino acid types between any two sets of tcr-pmhc, ag-ab, and protein-protein interfaces are shown in figure 3a. since the strong positive pcc  between tcr-pmhc and ag-ab interfaces, their amino acid preferences are significantly similar. however, neither tcr-pmhc nor ag-ab interfaces are similar to protein-protein interfaces. this result indicates that the composition of tcr-pmhc and ag-ab interfaces seems to resemble each other closely.

propensities of interface sizes and hydrogen bonds
we then gathered the sizes and proportions of hydrogen bonds  among tcr-pmhc, ag-ab, and protein-protein interfaces to analyse their properties. the average numbers of interacting residue pairs of tcr-pmhc  and ag-ab  interfaces are significantly less than the one of the protein-protein interfaces  . this informs that such immune-related binding regions are small than average. interestingly, the h-bonds proportions of tcr-pmhc interfaces  and ag-ab interfaces  are slight higher than protein-protein interfaces . h-bonds are extremely important in biological systems and play a key role in the structure of polymers, both synthetic and natural. these results suggest that although the tcr-pmhc and ag-ab interfaces are short and discontinuous, h-bonds might contribute a crucial part.

local structural alignment of binding domains
tcr and antibody are composed of six variable loops  and have the same domain annotation ) based on scop  <cit>  database. for local analysis the binding regions, we performed a structural alignment of the functional domains in tcr and antibody using multiprot  <cit> , an efficient and accurate method for local structural pairwise and multiple alignment. figure 3c shows that the v set domains of tcrs and antibodies share highly structural similarity . currently, it is postulated that the cdr <dig> loops of tcr α and β chains specifically recognize the diversity of bound peptides of pmhc  <cit>  thus play a key role of tcr-pmhc binding. we observed the details of structural alignment and found that cdr <dig> and contact regions of tcr  and antibody  were well aligned together.

evaluation of binding affinity
to determine the contribution of a residue to the binding affinity, the alanine-scanning mutagenesis is frequently used as an experimental probe. we selected  <dig> mutated residues collected from the asedb  <cit>  with  <dig> ag-ab complexes whose 3d structures were known. those mutated residues should position at protein-protein interfaces and be the contact residues. based on the interacting characteristics, these  <dig> mutated residues can be divided into two types, including the residues forming hydrogen bonds and the other residues. among  <dig> mutated residues forming h-bonds, the ΔΔg values  are significantly higher than  <dig> mutated residues with vdw interactions  and the p -value <  <dig> . a residue mutation with the ΔΔg >  <dig>  is often considered as a hot spot and this residue often contribute extraordinarily high energy  <cit> . if the side chain of a residue forming h-bonds in the interface, the residue mutated to alanine often breaks this hydrogen bond. for these  <dig> mutated residues, 48%  residues forming h-bonds and 9%  residues with vdw interactions are hot spots due to their ΔΔg >  <dig> . among  <dig> mutated residues with vdw forces,  <dig> residues  and their complementary contact residues  form the stack force interactions. this high binding energy is consistent with the high binding scores in vdw scoring matrix . this result implied that the formation of h-bonds in ag-ab interfaces indeed dominates the binding energy changes. at the same time, the residues forming more sidechain contacts could from more energy and be more influenced during the residue mutation to alanine which only has a short sidechain. figure 4b illustrates the relationship between the ΔΔg and the number of sidechain contact. the significant correlation  implied that the sidechain contact in ag-ab interfaces also indeed dominates the binding energy changes.

in addition, imatrix were evaluated on these  <dig> mutated residues to observe the correlation between experimental ΔΔg values and predicted energies. the pcc between two scoring systems  and one matrix used in pacomplex ) and free energies are shown in figure 4c. the pcc values of imatrix and one matrix are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. our results show that the imatrix which separate vdw forces, hydrogen bonds, sidechain contact, and backbone contact could have higher correlation of the binding interface energies. this result is also consistence with the ΔΔg contribution of h-bond and sidechain contact . these results imply that imatrix considering h-bond energies and highlight sidechain contact can yield the benefits to model the binding energy to gather statistics of the ag-ab interfaces.

large-scale peptide antigen identification on  <dig> pathogens
to further investigate the reliability of imatrix, we identified the homologous peptide antigens from  <dig> pathogens. then, we collected  <dig> tcr-pmhc structure complexes  from pdb and  <dig>  experimental peptide antigens  from the iedb  <cit>  as the template, positive, and negative set, respectively. among these pathogens, over  <dig> peptide candidates with jz ≥  <dig>  were selected for analyzing the relationships between jz values with both the numbers of positive homologous peptide antigens  and precision . when jz is higher than  <dig> , the precision >  <dig>  and the number of positive antigens exceeds  <dig> according to the positive and negative datasets . if the jz threshold is set to  <dig> , the total number of inferring possible peptide antigens surpasses  <dig>  statistically derived from  <dig> tcr-pmhc complexes. for  <dig> pathogens, we summarized the precision, the number of predicted homologous peptide antigens, and the positive and negative hits recorded in the iedb for each pathogen . among these  <dig> pathogens, two vaccinia viruses have the most positive hits recorded in the iedb and the precision of our method is higher than  <dig> . moreover, table  <dig> shows the number of peptides  in the peptide antigen families derived from the imatrix and one-matrix. although the precisions of homologous peptide antigen prediction have no difference under three different threshold , the numbers of hits derived from imatrix are significantly higher than derived from the one-matrix, especially while the threshold is set to  <dig> . we also validated the peptide-immune recognitions in mhc alleles of h-2-kb  and h-2-ld  from the iedb. the performance of imatrix is consistently slightly superior to one matrix in three sets, hla-a <dig>  h-2-kb, and h-2-ld . these results implied that the homologous peptide antigen derived from imatrix could achieve a better predicting accuracy.

joint
to further investigate the reliability of peptide compositions derived from difference matrices, we evaluated the hydrogen-bond  ratio of each homologous peptide. the h-bond ratio is calculated as:

 h-bondratio=no.ofh-bondwithinthehomologouspeptideno.ofh-bondwithinthetemplatepeptide 

where the h-bond ratio is equal to  <dig> while the number of h-bond within homologous peptide is equal to the template peptide . figure 5b illustrates the ratio of peptide which h-bond ratio equal to  <dig> within the peptide antigen family during different joint z-value. the ratios of peptide with identical h-bond derived from the imatrix have significant increasing while the threshold of joint z-value is increasing. more importantly, the homologous peptides with joint z-value >  <dig> derived from imatrix have a significantly highest value of h-bond ratio . according our analysis described above, the h-bonds play an important role on the free energy of interface. therefore, these peptide antigens with joint z-value >  <dig> derived from imatrix have a high precision value  and keep the h-bond based on template  should be the more reliable peptide antigen than derived from one matrix.

homologous peptide antigens of tax-1
protein tax- <dig> is a transcriptional activator of human t-cell leukemia virus  <dig>  <cit> . the htlv tax protein is crucial for viral replication and for initiating malignant transformation leading to the development of adult t-cell leukemia  <cit> . tax- <dig> has been shown to be oncogenic and also up-regulate interleukin  <dig> , which is known to be linked to leukemogenesis  <cit> . the imatrix scoring function can infer the experimental positive epitope of tax- <dig>  and provides the detailed binding model based on its best hit template . after tax peptide  presented by extracellular domains of hla-a <dig>  it is recognized by tcr  of homo sapiens. the co-crystal tcr-pmhc structure assigned by imatrix scoring function provides important contact residues and binding forces. tyr <dig> of tax peptide extends its aromatic sidechain deep into the pocket of tcr surface and forms one h-bond to asp <dig> of tcr1α .

furthermore, we would like to know whether the homologous peptide antigens of tax peptide derived from imatrix and one-matrix are different. the amino acid composition of the homologous peptide antigens was generated by by weblogo, which is a graphical representation of an amino acid multiple sequence alignment  <cit> . the homologous peptide antigens originated in imatrix are more than a double of the number originated in one-matrix . the amino acid composition of the homologous peptide antigens imatrix  and one-matrix scoring function  generating by weblogo, which is a graphical representation of an amino acid multiple sequence alignment  <cit> . two homologous peptide antigen sets maintained the important position  <dig> in peptide and conserved to tyr . this result conformed to the template-based atomic binding model . interestingly, position  <dig> in figure 6b preferred all polar residues , whereas position  <dig> appeared phe in figure 6c . however, phe in position  <dig> of peptide is unreasonable and causes the loss of the critical h-bond. the imatrix corrected such inaccuracy by considering special bond energies located in sidechain or backbone. figure 2c provides the sidechain to sidechain special bond energies . according to the scores, tyr to asp is  <dig>   and phe to asp is  <dig>  , respectively. these related results show the imatrix reveals the interacting environment by individually evaluating binding force and locations.

the  <dig> positive hits which are recorded in the iedb derived from imatrix scoring function shows a high consensus in position  <dig> ; moreover, position  <dig> of  <dig> novel homologous peptides  in the red frame are exact to tyr.

homologous peptide antigens of ny-eso-1
ny-eso- <dig> is one of the most promising tumor-specific antigens, which was identified by the application of serological analysis of recombinant cdna libraries from human tumors  <cit> . the imatrix infers ny-eso-1157- <dig> sllmwitqc  on tcr recognition according to the structural template . the amino acid composition of homologous peptide antigens were generated by imatrix  and one-matrix , respectively. according to imatrix sensitive to atomic interactions between tcr and peptide, positions  <dig> and  <dig> of peptide  had particularly come into our notice that imatrix excluded "phe" from homologous peptide antigens in these two positions . the crystal structure demonstrated the rationality of imatrix . trp <dig> of ny-eso- <dig> peptide bound to pro <dig> by forming one crucial h-bond and a stacking interaction with aromatic tyr <dig> of tcrα; thr <dig> has another important h-bond occurred in sidechain. we used pymol mutagenesis  <cit>  to simulate the w5y mutation in peptide and it might reserve the h-bond and stacking interaction . these results corresponded with the position  <dig> of peptide where conserved to trp and tyr ; however, w5f mutation abolished hydrogen binding to tcr . as a result, the amino acid pattern suggested by imatrix indeed revealed binding mechanism and maintained essential binding energy.

complementarity of interactions within a vdw network
imatrix also evaluates binding environments abound with vdw forces well. peptide p <dig> appears to be stabilized in establishing a vdw network  through phe <dig> interacts with residues phe <dig>  ala <dig>  and ser <dig> in the tcr cdr3α loop and trp <dig>  val <dig>  ser <dig> in the tcr cdr3β loop . imatrix infers homologous peptide antigens drawn amino acid composition in figure 8b and one-matrix's in figure 8c. the position  <dig> in peptide has a preference for aromatic residues  proposed by imatrix ; that is suitable for vdw environments in pocket. val appeared in position  <dig> derived from one-matrix  is too small to stabilize the interface. in addition, atygvwppv identified by using one-matrix is a negative epitope of vaccinia virus recorded in the iedb and could be filtered by imatrix. the result implies that imatrix performs van der waals interactions with the sidechain contact modeling well than one-matrix.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed the imatrix, ppi-scoring matrices and a template-based approach for modelling of tcr-pmhc interactions in a genome-wide scale. our scoring matrices, including four knowledge-based scoring matrixes, are able to identify the significant hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions in the both tcr-peptide and mhc-peptide interfaces. experimental results demonstrate that these matrices can yield high precisions of binding affinity and infer homologous peptide antigens of a template tcr-pmhc structure on  <dig> pathogen genomes. in addition, our structural tcr-pmhc models can provide detailed interacting models and crucial binding regions. we believe that our scoring matrixes and template-based method are able to provide biological insights and binding mechanisms of tcr-pmhc and to reveal the immune reactions for peptide vaccine designs.
