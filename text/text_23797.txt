BACKGROUND
the ability of agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer dna into a plant cell via horizontal gene transfer has been instrumental in progressing the field of plant molecular biology, enabling methods such as t-dna tagging  <cit> , agrobacterium-mediated transformation  for delivery of gene expression and silencing vectors  <cit> , and the introduction of genes of interest into plant genomes  <cit> . in effect, these abilities have underpinned the integration of crop biotechnology into mainstream agriculture, driving the development of genetically modified crop varieties equipped with novel traits, which in  <dig> were planted across  <dig> million hectares  <cit> . indeed, based on the use of amt, commodity crop improvement through genetic engineering has become the fastest adopted crop technology in the world with global value of the biotech/gm seed market estimated to be in excess of $ <dig> billion  <cit> . however, the complexity of the agrobacterium patent landscape remains a challenge for non-patent holders  <cit> , as the execution of existing patents on crop biotechnology can restrict the widespread application of amt technology by non-patent holders  <cit> .

the possibility of modifying non-agrobacterium strains to facilitate horizontal gene transfer was first described by hooykaas et al. , with work by van veen et al.  <cit>  showing that while phyllobacterium myrsinacearum  plasmid) could cause tumorigenesis on plants, rhizobium meliloti could not. it was not until  <dig> though that the potential of non-agrobacterium species’ to horizontally transfer genes into plant genomes was re-visited through cambia’s transbacter™ project. using the rhizobial species sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig>  rhizobium sp. ngr <dig>  and mesorhizobium loti maff <dig>  it was demonstrated that non-agrobacterium rhizobia could indeed transfer t-dna into plant cells  <cit> . however, the transformation frequency of these species was inadequate to provide a viable alternative to a. tumefaciens <cit> , which prompted the search for alternatives from a collection of diverse soil bacteria  <cit> . this initiative unearthed a lesser known rhizobial species, ensifer adhaerens <cit> , as a rhizosphere inhabiting bacterium with the ability to successfully transform potato, tobacco and arabidopsis. designated ensifer adhaerens ov <dig> , this strain can deliver sufficient transformation frequencies to present ensifer-mediated transformation  as a viable alternative to existing transformation technology platforms  <cit> .

the genetic and molecular mechanisms supporting the stable integration of a. tumefaciens t-dna  into plant genomes have been the focus of intense research efforts since the first reports of amt in the 1980s. a bacterial pathogen that causes ‘crown gall’ disease across a broad range of dicotyledonous and  monocotyledonous species  <cit> , a. tumefaciens genetically transforms its host by transferring a single stranded dna fragment  from its ti plasmid into the host cell genome  <cit> . the t-dna is exported from the bacterial cell into the plant cell together with several virulence effector proteins via a type iv secretion system. by coating the t-dna on its journey into the plant cell nucleus, this t-dna structure appears more as a protein complex than a single strand of dna  <cit> . for the purposes of genetic transformation, existing bacterial sequences within the left and right border of the t-dna can be replaced with genes of interest , which can then be delivered into the targeted host genome using amt. the reader is directed to a number of excellent reviews for an in-depth explanation and discussion of this process  <cit> .

the genome sequences of a. tumefaciens c <dig>  and s. meliloti  <dig>  were completed in  <dig>  <cit> . although these two gram-negative alphaproteobacteria are members of the same phylogenetic family  and inhabit the rhizosphere, they operate very different lifestyles . the primary circular chromosomes of c <dig> and  <dig> have been shown to share large-scale synteny, while only limited stretches of synteny can be found among additional replicons  <cit> . it is upon these more unique replicons that genes encoding functions leading to the different lifestyles of these organisms are found. for example, the above-mentioned t-dna transfer mechanism of a. tumefaciens is located on the large ti plasmid and genes key to the symbiotic interaction of  <dig> with legumes are found on two megaplasmids namely psyma and psymb  <cit> .

the application of functional genomic studies to dissect the processes of amt have identified a number of genes located on the a. tumefaciens circular and linear chromosomes that are implicated in virulence through the processes of attachment, vir gene regulation, and resisting plant defence responses. initial reversible attachment to plant cells involving beta- <dig> -glucan and secondary irreversible attachment involving cellulose fibrils are early requirements for a. tumefaciens virulence while beta- <dig> -glucan in s. meliloti plays an important role in symbiosis  <cit> . while the patc <dig> plasmid is non-essential for virulence of a. tumefaciens, it contains several att genes involved in attachment and patc58’s presence has been shown to have a positive effect on vir gene expression  <cit> . mutations to a group of chv genes plus ros, aopb and miaa have all been shown to restrict, and in some cases halt virulence  <cit> . the ability of the bacterial cell to protect itself against plant derived reactive oxygen species  is also required for virulence by both plant pathogens and symbionts  <cit> . for example, a catalase  conferring gene has been shown to be upregulated in response to h2o <dig> via the peroxide sensor oxyr in both c <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the rhizosphere is typically an acidic environment  enriched by plant exudates including but not limited to sugars, ions, free oxygen and water  <cit> . transcriptomic profiling of c <dig> and  <dig> in response to a shift to acidic ph, has revealed a shared regulational change in genes involved in membrane composition and motility  <cit> . separately, a chromosomally located two component sensor gene key to virulence in c <dig> and to symbiosis in  <dig> termed chvg/chvi has been cited as a global ph regulator  <cit> . a recently published study of  <dig> sinorhizobium strains concluded that subtle differences in the presence of symbiosis associated genes involved in nod-factor and polysaccharide biosynthesis, denitrification and type iii, iv, and vi secretion systems leads to varying compatibility among strains in legume-sinorhizobium interactions  <cit> . an independent study looking at  <dig> rhizobia strains, including  <dig>  noted differences in gene content in key groups of genes, including those involved in nodulation, nitrogen fixation, production of exopolysaccharides and type i to type vi secretion systems with the authors concluding no simple ‘core symbiome’ exists among rhziobia  <cit> . in contrast to the number of comparative studies focused on symbiotic interactions that have been carried out to date, no study has yet focused on the ability of plant transformation within the rhizobia.

while a draft genome of e. adhaerens csba has recently been reported, to the best of our knowledge only dna sequences for cobalamin biosynthetic  genes are publicly available  <cit> . in this study the genome of ov <dig> was sequenced and functionally annotated by comparing to the already sequenced genomes of c <dig> and  <dig> using the eggnog database  <cit> . subsequently, the literature was screened for all genes reported to have a positive effect on a. tumefaciens virulence and then homologs to these genes were sought for in ov <dig>  and also in  <dig> for additional comparison. the level of homology between genes was compared and, where relevant, gene copy number was considered. in addition, a phylogenetic analysis was completed on a core group of housekeeping genes and rhizobiales chromosomal-located virulence related genes to clarify the position of ov <dig> within the large, diverse rhizobiaceae family.

RESULTS
general features of the e. adhaerens ov <dig> genome versus that of a. tumefaciens c <dig> and s. meliloti 1021
the ov <dig> genome is the largest of the three species at  <dig>  mb;  <dig>  mb bigger than the c <dig> genome and  <dig>  mb larger than the  <dig> genome . composed of four replicons of sizes  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb and 125 kb, the ov <dig> genome is similar to that of  <dig>  which is also made up of three large circular replicons minus the small accessory plasmid. in contrast the c <dig> genome differs dramatically with the circular chromosome being approximately 25% less than the size of ov14’s and 1021’s counterpart and the presence of a linear chromosome being a feature unique to c <dig>  that said, ov <dig>  and c <dig> share a similar sized 120–180 kb mobile plasmid not found in  <dig>  the gc content of c58’s genome is notably lower  compared to that of ov <dig>  and  <dig>  genomes , with a total genome comparison highlighting a greater level of synteny between ov <dig> and  <dig> .

for each entry information is as follows; replicon id, replicon size, average gene length, replicons gc content as percentage, no. rrna, and no. trna.

structurally, chromosome  <dig> of ov <dig> shares 54% nucleotide homology with the chromosome of  <dig>  while the circular and linear chromosomes of c <dig> share 20% and 5% homology, respectively with chromosome  <dig> of ov <dig>  chromosome  <dig> of ov <dig> shows reduced homology of 20% to psymb, 2% to psyma, and 3% to the  <dig> chromosome. in regards to c <dig>  3% and 7% homology to chromosome  <dig> of ov <dig> is noted for the circular and linear chromosome, respectively. the third replicon of ov <dig> shows 7% homology to both the psyma and psymb of  <dig>  and 4% homology to the linear chromosome of c <dig>  finally the small accessory plasmid pov14c shows between 1–2% homology to each of the replicons. homology of pov <dig> to c <dig> replicons are found in pti and pat at 22% and 3%, respectively.

the three genomes of ov <dig>   <dig> and c <dig> were compared by using evolutionary genealogy of genes: non-supervised orthologous groups  assignments. the eggnog database is formatted to functionally categorise genes within twenty-five groups. twenty-one of the  <dig> eggnog functional categories have representatives in the three genomes in this study . those categories that are not represented are rna processing and modification , nuclear structure , cytoskeleton  and extracellular structures . in total  <dig> nogs were identified in this study with  <dig>  being shared among the three species . ov <dig> has the most species-specific nogs at  <dig> , marginally ahead of c <dig> with  <dig>  whilst  <dig> has less at  <dig> . of the nogs that are shared between two species and not present within the third species; ov <dig> and  <dig> share  <dig>  almost 3-fold more than that shared by ov <dig> and c <dig> at  <dig> , and  <dig> -fold more than that shared between c <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig>  .

five of the functional categories grouped under the heading of cellular processing and signalling were of most interest to this study . in category , ‘defence mechanisms’, a total of  <dig> nogs were recorded with  <dig>  shared across all three species. within this category ov <dig> recorded the most individual nogs at  <dig>  followed by  <dig> and c <dig> with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for the signal transduction mechanisms  category a total of  <dig> nogs were found of which  <dig>  were shared by all species, while within this category c <dig> contained  <dig> individual nogs,  <dig> more than both ov <dig> and  <dig>  also to be noted were the minimal number of nogs shared by c <dig> and  <dig>  compared to ov <dig> and c <dig>  and ov <dig> and  <dig> . within the category cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis   <dig>  of a total of  <dig> were shared by all three species; ov <dig> and  <dig> sharing  <dig> , which was more than the  <dig>  shared across ov <dig> and c <dig> and the  <dig>  for c <dig> and  <dig>  although c <dig> shares a lower number of nogs with the other two species in category  it does possess the highest number of species specific nogs at  <dig> . cell motility is category  representing  <dig> nogs for which  <dig>  were shared by all three species, with no nogs shared by c <dig> and  <dig>  in category   there were a total of  <dig> nogs of which  <dig>  were shared by all three species. category  showed the most even distribution of any category. the final category of specific interest is post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones  with a total of  <dig> nogs for which  <dig>  were shared by all three species; ov <dig> and  <dig> with  <dig> , ov <dig> and c <dig> and c <dig> and  <dig> with  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. individually, ov <dig> possessed  <dig> ,  <dig> possessed  <dig>  and c <dig> possessed  <dig> .

attachment
the chromosomal virulence gene a  is a member of a group of orthologous genes found in the eggnog database under the code apronog <dig> . encoding a cyclic beta- <dig> -glucan abc transporter, its function is linked to chvb a member of apronog <dig>  which encodes a cyclic beta 1- <dig> glucan synthase. together chva and chvb function to synthesise and transport beta- <dig>  glucan across the inner membrane, which is required for attachment of the bacterial cell to the plant cell surface. genes with parallel function named ndva and ndvb are found in  <dig>  all three species were found to possess one gene in the apronog <dig> representative of chva/ndva . located on chromosome one of ov <dig> is a gene showing 89% protein sequence identity to ndva of  <dig> and 77% identity to chva of c <dig>  two genes downstream of ov14’s chva/ndva homolog was a chvb/ndvb homolog  showing 86% and 68% protein sequence identity to respective sequences in  <dig> and c <dig>  respectively. ov <dig> also has a second chvb/ndvb gene sharing 47% and 50% protein sequence identity to 1021’s and c58’s chvb/ndvb respectively. a third gene involved in the synthesis of beta 1- <dig> glucan is psca/exoc  encoding a phosphoglucomutase, which recorded 90% and 81% to the respective target in  <dig> and c <dig>  respectively.

the ov <dig> genome was also screened for the presence/absence of genes linked to the c <dig> pat att locus, which contains up to  <dig> genes for which some have been implicated in the early stages of attachment and virulence. the attr gene is part of apronog <dig> and encodes an acetyltransferase but no copies were found across the ov <dig> genome, compared to a single copy in  <dig> and two attr copies in c <dig>  the genes attb and attd are implicated in bacteria-plant signalling during root colonisation and at the wound site during pathogenesis, with attb part of apronog <dig> annotated as part of a binding-protein-dependent transport system, which is predicted to transport mannopine in c <dig>  <cit> . while  <dig> and c <dig> both possess a single copy, a member of the apronog <dig> was not found in ov <dig>  the attd gene of c <dig> appears to be unique, unassigned to any apronog and having no similar sequence in ov <dig> or  <dig>  mutations to genes attc and attg can render agrobacterium avirulent on tomato and carrot by preventing attachment to the host cell  <cit> . both genes are annotated as abc transporters for which no orthologs exist in ov14: an attc ortholog in apronog <dig> is present in  <dig> and c <dig> . the attklm  operon within this locus has been linked to quorum sensing and found to be up regulated in response to salicylic acid  in c <dig>  <cit> . all three species contain multiple gene entries  in apronog <dig>  which houses the c <dig> blca . no genes homologous to c <dig> blcb  or blcc  were found in ov <dig>  while the role of the remaining genes of the att locus in virulence remains unclear, the genes atte, attf, attg, atth, atto, attt, attv, atty and attz were not found within the ov <dig> genome, or that of  <dig> either . however, they are represented by apronogs highlighting their presence among other alphaproteobacteria. genes found in the c <dig> att locus not represented by apronogs include attd, attp, atts, attu, attw, and attx.

the cel locus is comprised of six genes celabcdeg and encodes a synthase for cellulose fibrils implicated in the second stage of attachment referred to as tight binding, which is irreversible  <cit>  and critical for the virulence of agrobacterium cells  <cit> . the genome of ov <dig> had genes orthologous to celabceg, but not celd, which are thought to be cytoplasmic lipid carriers . the apronogs representing celabcg genes were found in 23– <dig> separate alphaproteobacteria while apronogs including celde were located in only  <dig> alphaproteobacteria. of interest,  <dig> did not contain any orthologs to the cel genes of c <dig> .

the presence of phosphatidylcholine in prokaryotic membranes is generally confined to species that intimately interact with eukaryotic cells  <cit> . two pathways present in c <dig> can lead to phosphatidylcholine production; the methylation pathway that requires pmta  and the pcs pathway that requires pcs   <cit> . in c <dig> phosphatidylcholine is found in the inner and outer membrane constituting around 23% of total membrane lipids. the pcs gene of ov <dig> shares 92% and 85% protein sequence identity with  <dig> and c <dig> respectively, while the pmta gene of ov <dig> shares 83% and 67% protein sequence identity with 1021’s and c58’s respecitvely. the pcs pathway is dependent on the uptake of choline from the environment  <cit> . screening ov <dig> for the choline abc transporter genes choxwv , revealed that the chox solute binding protein component  was represented by two orthologs in all three species . the abc atpase chow  has one member in each species and the choline permease  was noted to have three members in c <dig>  two in ov <dig> and one in  <dig> 

host cell wall degradation
the c <dig> genome contains two copies of the pica gene , which encodes a polygalacturonase to degrade the pectin network in targeted cell walls and aid the secretion of bacterial proteins into the plant cell  <cit> . the genome of ov <dig> was equipped with one copy showing 78% identity to pica of c <dig>  while  <dig> has no recorded pica homolog . a complementary gene involved in pectin degradation is kdgf , with all three species possessing a kdgf homolog; ov <dig> sharing 72% and 47% protein sequence identity with c <dig> and  <dig> respectively. finally all three species possessed a member of the apronog <dig>  a beta-etherase linked to a lignin degradation protein annotated as lige in  <dig> and c <dig>  with ov14’s lige homolog sharing 77% and 65% protein sequence identity to  <dig> and c <dig>  respectively.

chromosomal regulation of ti based virulence genes
key to the regulation of vir genes in agrobacterium is the chvg/chvi two-component sensor, with a mutation to either chvg or chvi halting virulence  <cit> . responsive to acidic ph, the chvg/chvi sensor regulates aopb and kata, two genes involved indirectly in virulence by promoting homeostasis in acidic conditions. a homologous system in  <dig> is also responsive to acidic ph. this two component sensor encoded by exos/chvi regulates the production of succinoglycan and is vital for symbiosis with alfalfa  <cit> . the ov <dig> genome has genes homologous to both chvg   and chvi  situated in an operon as expected for two-component sensors . the ov <dig> exos  homolog shared 91% and 79% protein sequence identity to 1021’s exos and c58’s chvg, whereas the ov <dig> chvi homolog shared 94% and 91% protein sequence identity to  <dig> and c <dig> chvi homologs, respectively. the chvd from c <dig> interacts with virb <dig> and has a positive effect on virulence, with both virulence and vir gene expression greatly reduced when the function of chvd is disrupted in c <dig>  <cit> . a member of apronog <dig>  all three species contained a homolog with the ov <dig> homolog recording 89% and 87% protein sequence identity, corresponding to that of  <dig> and c <dig> 

chromosomal virulence gene e  codes for a multiple sugar binding periplasmic sensor, which interacts with the periplasmic domain of vira aiding in the regulation of the vir operon through the vira/g two-component sensor. ov <dig> possesses chve as a member of the apronog <dig>  sharing 93% and 77% protein sequence identity to its  <dig> and c <dig> counterparts. the chve homologs of  <dig> and ov <dig> are ~100 bp shorter than the version located in c <dig>  with the difference found towards the n terminus of the gene where a putative ligand binding site is positioned. on the c <dig> circular chromosome, chve is located adjacent to gguabc components of an abc sugar transporter. the same operon arrangement is found in all three species chve-gguabc with all species’ gguabc genes present in the same apronogs . in regards to the c <dig> gene chvh , virulence of a. tumefaciens is decreased in the chvh mutant, which has been linked to reduced levels of vire <dig>  <cit> . the ov <dig> chvh homolog was found to share 95% and 84% protein sequence identity to 1021’s and c58’s respective copy.

the a. tumefaciens ros regulator  has been shown to repress the virc and vird operons by binding to a ros box within promoter regions of both genes, but the binding activity of virg is able to overcome this repression although the exact mechanism is unclear. the  <dig> ros homolog named mucr  is involved in the regulation of both motility and exopolysaccharide production  <cit> . the ov <dig> genome has one gene homologous to the ros gene sharing 92% and 79% to  <dig>  and c <dig> counterparts, correspondingly . a homolog of the c <dig> miaa gene was found in ov <dig>  with mutations of the miaa gene in a. tumefaciens reported to marginally decrease virb, vird and vire gene expression  <cit> . the miaa gene  encodes a trna delta -isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase which is involved in protein translation; a homolog was also identified in  <dig> 

chromosomal based acvb
c58’s acvb  contains multiple annotations, the most common being an acid induced virulence protein and the virj-like protein. the acvb protein has been reported to bind to the t-strand in the periplasm increasing transport efficiency to the plant cell compared to an acvb
-
strain  <cit> . in this regard, ov <dig> contained one entry in apronog <dig> as did c <dig>  while  <dig> possessed two. the ov <dig> acvb homolog shares 53% protein identity to c <dig> acvb and the two  <dig> acvb orthologs smc <dig> and smc <dig> were found to share disrupted homology to the c <dig> and ov <dig> acvb genes .

protecting against plant defences
the c <dig> gene kata  encodes a catalase-peroxidase implicated in virulence through detoxification of hydrogen peroxide encountered during bacteria-plant interactions  <cit> . three catalase genes have been previously identified in 1021; kata, katb and katc <cit> , with the  <dig> katb being a member homologous to and a member of the same apronog as the c <dig> kata. ov <dig> had two gene members in apronog00015; one sharing 89% protein sequence identity with c58’s kata and 61% identity to katb of  <dig> and a second more putative gene with 64% similarity to the c <dig> katb gene. the oxyr peroxide sensor regulates transcription of kata in c <dig> with hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions indirectly/directly oxidizing oxyr leading to kata activation  <cit> . although the oxyr gene of c <dig> and  <dig> are found separately in apronog <dig> and apronog <dig> respectively, ov <dig> was found to only contain a homolog of the c <dig> oxyr. while ov <dig> does possess a dps family protein ; not found in c <dig> or  <dig>  no homologs to the c <dig> dps , which functions to protect dna from hydroxyl radicals produced during oxidation of fe  by hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  were detected in ov <dig>  or  <dig> .

c <dig> and  <dig> both have a single catalase gene in apronog <dig> that functions in protecting cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide, annotated as cate in c <dig> and catc in  <dig>  no homolog was detected in ov <dig>  superoxide dismutases help to protect the cell via dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and three copies of the sodb gene  were found in c <dig>  two copies in ov <dig> and one copy in  <dig> . knockout of all three sodb genes in a. tumefaciens results in avirulence, while only the sodbi mutant shows reduced virulence when targeted individually  <cit> .

ti based virulence
the vir operon found on the c <dig> ti plasmid encodes the core machinery for the production and transport of t-dna from the bacterial cell with the two-component regulator vira/g switching on expression of ancillary vir genes upon detection of plant phenolics. no homologs of this system were found to exist in ov <dig>  or  <dig>  a combination of virb genes and vird <dig> form the type iv secretion system of c <dig>  part of apronog <dig> , the vird <dig> apronog is shared by seventy-two species. the apronog <dig> has two entries in c <dig> , named vird4-like and vird <dig>  respectively. four vird4-like genes were identified in ov <dig>  upon inspection only one was found to share a protein sequence identity exceeding 50% with any known alphaproteobacteria gene, sharing 71% protein sequence identity to vird <dig>  of a. rhizogenes k <dig> 
ensifer adhaerens 
ov <dig>  
agrobacterium tumefaciens 
c <dig>  and 
sinorhizobium meliloti

the virb operon encodes for eleven proteins , which form the t-dna transporting type iv secretion system. c <dig> has three similar type iv secretion systems, a ti-plasmid based virb, a ti plasmid trb operon and a linear chromosome based avh. virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig>  and virb <dig> form part of the same apronogs as their avh counterparts, with virb <dig>  virb <dig>  and virb <dig> found in different apronogs from counterpart’s avhb <dig>  avhb <dig>  avhb <dig>  while avhb <dig>  avhb <dig>  avhb <dig>  and avhb <dig> are all found in apronogs, virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig>  and virb <dig> are not associated with any apronog. in this analysis, ov <dig> shares apronog <dig> , apronog <dig>  and apronog <dig>  only. the genes present from ov <dig> identified as part of apronog <dig> showed less than 50% protein sequence identity to the closest matches from phenylobacterium zucineum hlk <dig> and erythrobacter litoralis htcc <dig>  with ov <dig> containing  <dig> genes for apronog <dig> 

some proteins encoded by the vir regulon are non-essential for transformation but are known to increase transformation efficiency. the respective proteins of virc <dig> and virc <dig> may enhance nicking at the right border of t-dna and vire <dig> is exported to the plant cell along with the t-strand potentially protecting the ss-dna from degradation or detection. the vire <dig> protein binds to vire <dig> within the bacterial cell blocking interaction with the t-strand until within the plant cell. no homologs for either were found in ov <dig> or  <dig>  the genes of the vire operon and virc <dig> were not found in any apronog but the virc <dig> gene was a member of apronog <dig> that was identified to be present in  <dig> alphaproteobacteria species. the virulence genes virf, virh <dig> and virh <dig> have been implicated in the expansion of the host range during agrobacterium-mediated transformation  <cit> , with virf involved in the stripping of vire <dig> proteins off the t-dna and virh <dig> and virh <dig> involved in the detoxification of anti-bacterial phenolics. with gene virf not part of an apronog and virh <dig> and virh <dig> of c <dig> sharing apronogs with only  <dig> other species, agrobacterium rhizogenes k <dig> and chelativorans sp. bnc <dig>  no homologs were found in ov <dig> or  <dig> 

type iv secretion systems
compared to the three t4ss found in c <dig> , only one t4ss was identified in ov <dig> ; equivalent to a single system also present in  <dig> . the virb t4ss, which is known to export t-dna from the bacterial cell into the plant cell is only found on the ti-plasmid of a. tumefaciens. c58’s trb is known to be responsible for conjugation of the ti-plasmid between bacterial cells. a homologous trb was found on pov14c , with the trb operon sharing the same gene arrangement and located immediately upstream of repabc in both the ov <dig> and c <dig> genome. the protein sequence identities of the  <dig> genes comprising the trb operon ranged from 71% to 90%.

ph responsive gene networks
key to vir gene regulation is chvi, which functions with chvg  and is up regulated in both c <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . nine exo genes  involved in the synthesis and metabolism of succinoglycan are shared and up regulated in both organisms and all nine genes were found to be present in ov <dig>  two additional exo genes  were also noted to be in all three species. the acid inducible membrane protein aopb , which is involved in c <dig> virulence was also present as a single copy in ov <dig> and  <dig>  . all three species are represented in this nog with the ov <dig> homolog sharing 55% and 82% protein sequence homology with the c <dig> aopb and  <dig> ropb <dig>  respectively. finally a recently identified imp type vi  secretion system which is up regulated in c <dig> in response to low ph   <cit>  was not found in ov <dig> nor  <dig>  the function of this t6ss in c <dig> has yet to be determined.

by concatenating the full length sequence of  <dig> housekeeping  and  <dig> rhizobial virulence genes , chvb, chvd, chvg, miaa, and pcs) ov <dig> grouped with the sinorhizobium of the ensifer/sinorhizobium group forming a clade which is a sister group to the rhizobium/agrobacterium clade. within the ensifer/sinorhizobium group, e. adhaerens formed a sister group to the sinorhizobium species . blastn searches of each replicon of ov <dig> revealed the highest synteny to s. fredii for the chromosomes and to a. vitis s <dig> ptis <dig> and a. tumefaciens ptic <dig> for the e. adhaerens pov <dig> . if considering the main chromosome, for which large scale synteny was observed, a gradient of sequence identity can be observed in ov14’s chromosome one; s. fredii strains shows 58% query coverage, s. meliloti strains shows 54% query coverage, s. medicae 49%, rhizobium species including a. rhizogenes from 34–23%, and a. tumefaciens and mesorhizobium species show 20% query coverage. upon a blastn of the a. tumefaciens circular chromosome  the query coverage to the closet matched rhizobia species was 34% dropping to 27%. interestingly s. fredii species show higher coverage of the c <dig> circular chromosome at 26% than a. vitis does at 23%. finally s. meliloti and e. adhaerens share 22% and 20% coverage with the a. tumefaciens c <dig> circular chromosome, respectively. further support for this is available from the comparative nog analysis, which reported ov <dig> as sharing more genes with  <dig> than with c <dig>  whilst also showing that ov <dig> shares more genes with c <dig> than  <dig> and c <dig> share with each other .

discussion
while the ability of ov <dig> to genetically transform plant genomes has previously been demonstrated  <cit> , ov <dig> has not acquired a known suite of symbiosis or pathogenesis genes but instead appears to effectively utilise supplementary vir or sym genes for virulence and symbiosis. for example; e. adhaerens strain atcc  <dig> was found to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on phaseolus vulgaris  and leucaena leucocephala when equipped with the two symbiotic plasmids from rhizobium tropici cfn <dig>  <cit> , strain ov <dig> used in this study has shown the ability to deliver dna into plants when equipped with the unitary pcambia <dig> vector and strain 5d <dig> has been found to inhabit alfalfa nodules during a screen for diversity among the s. meliloti population  <cit> . of interest, r. etli ce <dig> has been shown to possess vir gene homologs on a self-transmissible vector indicating a potential source of novel vir genes in soil bacteria  <cit> .

for this study, the genome of ov <dig> was compared against the genomes of c <dig> and  <dig> using eggnog assignments to gain an understanding of their relatedness, with a focus being on an in/ability to transform plant cells. the potential of ov <dig> and  <dig> to transfer t-dna has only been achieved when equipped with a ti-plasmid  <cit> . in this study we confirmed that there are no agrobacterium vir gene homologs present in the ov <dig> genome. in the cases where homologs appeared in nogs alongside virb and vird <dig> it was likely due to parallel functions within type iv secretion systems. for the virb type iv secretion system virb <dig>  virb <dig>  virb <dig> and virb <dig> were not found as part of any nog suggesting no similar genes in fully sequenced alphaproteobacteria to date. however, sugawara et al.  <cit>  detected five clades of type iv secretion systems within  <dig> sequenced sinorhizobium species. phylogenetic analysis found a. tumefaciens virb genes to be present in clade i with  <dig> virb genes found in clade ii along with a. tumefaciens avh genes. interestingly, seven sinorhizobium strains were found to possess type iv secretion systems in clade i  <cit> .

homologs to all chromosomal-based genes cited to be essential for t-dna transfer in c <dig> were found to be present in ov <dig> and  <dig>  as indeed they are also present in several other alphaproteobacteria. additionally all genes shown to be beneficial for agrobacterium virulence were found in ov <dig>  however not all of these genes were identified in  <dig>  at first it may appear that these genes are advantageous to life in the rhizosphere, however their presence in bacteria such as the animal pathogen brucella broadens this hypothesis. transgression into the rhizosphere or an animal host represents a dramatic change in environmental conditions. while nutrient availability may increase, changes in ph and eukaryotic cells defending themselves against invasion becomes a new challenge for the cell to overcome. transcriptomic profiles in response to acidic ph  in both c <dig> and  <dig> have shown the expression of genes involved in succionoglycan biogenesis and the regulation of acid inducible genes  <cit> . down regulation of genes involved in motility via flagellum is also a shared response. separately, electron microscopy analysis of ov <dig> completed by this research group has already confirmed the presence of functional flagella . the production of flagellum requires a large amount of energy and down regulation may free up energy for rearrangement of the cell envelope. consequently, down regulation of flagellum may make the bacterial cell difficult to detect for the plant cell.

while many exo genes have been shown to be upregulated in c <dig> in response to acidic ph, the chvg/chvi sensor in c <dig> has not been shown to control their expression. exerting control over cell envelope composition is most likely critical to the type of interaction that occurs with the plant cell directly via cell-to-cell contact or indirectly via the ability of the membrane to incorporate influential proteins and protein complexes. indeed, differences in polysaccharide biosynthesis among sinorhizobium species has been predicted as a host determination factor allowing for varying strategies for legume-sinorhizobium interactions  <cit> . the c <dig> aopb has been shown to have a positive effect on virulence and was upregulated by acidic ph while the  <dig> aopb homolog ropb <dig> was not  <cit> . of interest, a ropb <dig> r. leguminosarum bv. viciae vf39sm mutant was shown to have increased sensitivity to detergents, hydrophobic antibiotics, and weak organic acids, with a suggestion that ropb <dig> plays a role in membrane stability  <cit> . for ov <dig>  it would be of interest to complete a transcriptomic analysis to monitor the expression of these key genes under varying induction conditions.

another cell wall component present in ov <dig>  c <dig> and  <dig> is phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid and major component of eukaryotic membranes. phosphatidylcholine has been shown to be essential for virulence in c <dig> and for symbiosis and normal growth in  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly an a. tumefaciens mutant deficient in phosphatidylcholine production was unable to support a type iv secretion system in the bacterial cell wall and subsequently lost its virulence potential  <cit> . the role of the virb type iv secretion system is known to be critical for t-dna transfer to plants and is potentially the only system capable of this feat. differences in phosphatidylcholine content in the cell wall of ov <dig>  c <dig> and  <dig> could affect the cells ability to support the complete virb type iv secretion system and greatly affect the transfer of t-dna. the phosphatidylcholine synthase  pathway is choline-dependent and requires the uptake of choline into the cell. an agrobacterium pcs/pmta double mutant has been shown to be attenuated in expression of the virb operon  <cit>  while a high-affinity choline abc transport choxwv has been identified in c <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> ; ov <dig> was found to contain homologs to this system. the chov gene encodes the atpase component of the abc transporter. the fact that c <dig> has an additional copy of chov compared to ov <dig> and two additional copies of chov compared to  <dig> suggests c <dig> may have an increased ability to actively acquire choline for phosphatidylcholine synthesis and ultimately complete t-dna transfer into targeted host cells.

one of the most notable differences across the studied genomes was that ov <dig> and c <dig> possess cel homologs that are absent in  <dig>  the cel locus has been implicated in the attachment of agrobacterium to the plant cell but is not required for tumour formation  <cit> . the presence of cel homologs in ov <dig> may suggest a role in attachment to plant surfaces or potentially other bacteria, which may explain its discovery within nodules alongside s. meliloti and the recorded ability of e. adhaerens to phagocytose other bacteria. another observed difference was the lack of a type vi  secretion system in ov <dig> and  <dig> compared to c <dig>  the lack of a type vi secretion system in  <dig> was also noted by sugawara et al.  <cit> . type vi secretion systems are a relatively new discovery and their application is not well understood. however studies in vibrio cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown the t6ss system to be involved in aggressive bacteria-to-bacteria cell interactions  <cit> .

the chromosomal-based acvb gene has been cited as essential for agrobacterium to achieve t-dna transfer in the absence of virj and has been found to localise to the periplasmic space and associate with the t-stand in agrobacterium <cit> . homologs to the acvb gene were found in all three species in this study and another  <dig> alphaproteobacteria upon inspection of apronog <dig>  the homology of the two  <dig> copies to the c <dig> acvb and ov <dig> homologs was found to be low, with it appearing that the  <dig> acvb has split into two genes, which may be why acvb was not initially detected in  <dig>  <cit> . the c <dig> and ov <dig> acvb shares 50% homology with virj a gene found on octopine-type ti plasmids which can complement a acvb mutant  <cit> . while acvb appears to play a role in export maybe as a chaperone to the t-strand  <cit> , the ov <dig> acvb homolog shares 50% identity to its c <dig> counterpart and could be a key target for future studies focussed on the improvement of emt.

the ability to defend against oxidative stress leads to increased virulence as the bacterial cell survives plant cell defences and acidic ph allowing expression of virulence genes and delivery of t-dna to plant cell. all three species in this study were found to possess genes involved in protection against reactive oxygen species. one such gene that was absent in ov <dig> and  <dig> was dps, , which in a. tumefaciens protects the cell by acting as an hydroxyl radical scavenger and could well function with a catalase such as kata to increase the cell’s tolerance to the toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide  <cit> .

in  <dig>  e. adhaerens was first described as a gram-negative predatory bacteria  <cit>  but more recently, a request to rename e. adhaerens to s. adhaerens initiated a debate as to the appropriate nomenclature  <cit> . following on from this the international committee on systematics of prokaryotes ruled all sinorhizobium species were to be transferred to ensifer based on ensifer being an early synonym of sinorhizobium <cit> . the current standing appears to be that ensifer is the correct name for the amended genus, but the judicial commission also acknowledges the later synonym sinorhizobium <cit> . the work detailed here describes the genome sequencing of ov <dig> and based on a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> housekeeping genes shows ov <dig> to form a branch separated from the sinorhizobia. while the primary chromosome of ov <dig> shows a high level of synteny with the sinorhizobia  the remaining replicons share minimal synteny to any known species and are a potential resource of novel alpha-proteobacterial genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has confirmed the presence of genes in ov <dig> that are confirmed homologs of chromosomal-based c <dig> virulence genes. as to how much their sequence diversity affects their function during t-dna transfer remains unknown. whereas the reported transformation efficiency of ov <dig> was achieved with environmental conditions optimal for a. tumefaciens, it is possible that ti virulence induction conditions for non-agrobacterium species may be different to a. tumefaciens and this is therefore an area that requires further attention. re-engineering these non-agrobacterium species with improved virulence functions offers the opportunity to increase the range of bacterial species that can be used for the genetic transformation of plant cells. considering the limitations to the host range of a. tumefaciens have already been described  <cit> , the use of non-pathogenic bacterial species may increase the range of plant species amenable to agronomic enhancement via genetic transformation.
