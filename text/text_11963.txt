BACKGROUND
dna methylation is an indispensable epigenetic modification of plant genomes. it occurs predominantly in the cg context in both plants and animals  <cit> . the state of cpg methylation regulates and stabilizes chromatin structure, and possibly regulates the accessibility of these dna regions to the transcriptional machinery  <cit> . studies have shown that dna methylation plays an important role in many plant processes, including transposon silencing, virus defence, and gene imprinting  <cit> .

in plant, dna methylation is mainly distributed in heterochromatic regions that are composed of tandem or inverted repeats, i.e., transposons. transposable elements  are usually highly methylated along their entire length, but dna methylation within genes is distributed away from the 5′ and 3′ ends. it has been proposed that dna methylation is primarily used to inhibit the transcription and movement of tes to protect genomes against uncontrolled insertions. some studies have reported that transposons or retrotransposons are activated in response to environmental stress and may generate true genetic or epigenetic changes for adapting to stresses  <cit> . in rice, epigenetic regulation has been reported to affect the transposition activity of tos <dig> and modulates the activity of the neighboring genes  <cit> . highly methylated transposons may affect transcription of neighboring genes. for example, the patterns of dna methylation in long terminal repeat  transposable elements differed between rice leaves and roots and affected the transcription of the neighboring genes  <cit> .

recently, three dna treatment techniques have been typically employed for dna methylation detection:  methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism ,  methylated dna enrichment ,  bisulfite-sequencing. with the advent of new technologies, the elucidation of the genome-wide methylation profiles is possible. in this regard, the immunoprecipitation of methylated dna by monoclonal antibodies specific to 5-methylcytidine  combined with high-throughput sequencing  has been used as a valuable tool to map methylated dna at the genomic scale  <cit> . the medip-seq approach employs an antibody against 5-methylcytosine or methyl-binding domain proteins to capture methylated dna, which are subsequently subjected to next generation sequencing  <cit> . after methylated dna enrichment, the unmethylated dna fragments are removed from the genome samples for reducing the redundancy. thus, a relatively lower sequencing throughput is required, compared with bisulfite-sequencing. in addition, medip is more unbiased and less limited than msap. due to these advantages, medip-seq is considered to have great potential for the development of cost-effective and unbiased strategies for whole genome dna methylation profiling.

rice  is one of the most important grain crops worldwide and provides a staple food for almost half of the world’s population  <cit> . recently, hybrid rice has made a tremendous contribution to food security both in china and many other countries which are losing arable land. hybrid rice technologies are mainly based on two well-known male sterility systems, namely cms  and egms . compared with the three-line system , the two-line system, is based on the discovery and application of egms lines, which serve as both the male sterile lines and maintainer lines under different environmental conditions  <cit> . ptgms  is the major type of egms germplasm resources and has been widely used for breeding two-line hybrid rice. the ptgms system is advantageous for broad restoration ability, easy maintenance, and multiplication  <cit> . thus, the utilization of ptgms lines is an important approach for the better exploitation of heterosis in rice.

peiai 64s  is one of the most important indica rice genic male sterile lines in two-line system. its paternal line is peiai <dig>  and its maternal line is nongken <dig>  which is the first photoperiod- sensitive genic male sterile line discovered by mingsong shi in hubei, china in  <dig>  <cit> . using pa64s as the maternal line, more than  <dig> two-line hybrid rice varieties have been developed since  <dig> in china. among these new varieties, liangyoupei <dig>  is an elite super hybrid rice and increases grain yield by approximately 20% per hectare compared with other hybrid rice lines in the past years  <cit> . the fertility transition of pa64s was controlled by the photoperiod and temperature: the sterility trait exhibited at temperatures higher than  <dig> °c during the anther development and long-day   conditions can suppress the fertility transition. therefore, under lower temperatures  and short-day   conditions during anther development, pa64s can transform from male sterility to fertility  <cit> .

to date, some studies have reported that a substitution of c-to-g in the male-fertility-associated noncoding rna p/tms12- <dig> in pa64s produced a mutant small rna, namely osa-smr5864m. this mutated noncoding small rna gene may lead to ptgms in pa64s  <cit> . furthermore, the transcriptome of the pgms rice nongken 58s was significantly suppressed under ld condition and the circadian rhythm pathway had been shown to be involved in the male sterility transition  <cit> . another noncoding rna called ldmar was also found in nongken 58s and was required for the fertility transition. a sirna  was detected to associate with the dna methylation pattern of the ldmar promoter in nongken 58s. and increasing methylation in the promoter of ldmar of nongken 58s also reduced the expression of ldmar, leading to male sterility  <cit> . these results suggested that dna methylation or rna-dependent dna methylation  might be involved in the regulation of ptgms.

brassinosteroids , a class of steroid hormones, have been reported to control male fertility by regulating the expression of several key genes involved in anther and pollen development, such as spl/nzz, tdf <dig>  ams, atmyb <dig> and ms <dig>  <cit> . the basic helix-loop-helix  protein bim <dig>  is a brassinosteroid signaling component involved in regulating br-induced genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . bri1- emssupressor <dig>  is shown to interact with bim <dig> and together bind to the e-box of a br-induced gene  <cit> .

in this study, we investigated the global dna methylation alterations in young panicles of the ptgms line pa64s under two different environmental conditions using the medip-seq method. the aim of this work was to explore the dna methylation patterns and their influences on gene expression during the transition from sterile to fertile in pa64s. the results will provide some information for a better understanding of the role of dna methylation in ptgms rice.

RESULTS

genome-wide dna methylation profiles of pa64s  and pa64s 
to decipher the genome-wide dna methylome of pa64s under two different environmental conditions, we immunoprecipitated sheared genomic dna with an antibody which specifically recognizes 5-methylcytosine and sequenced the enriched methylated dna. only the uniquely mapped reads were used in the scanning of the methylation peak. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated for the two samples, and more than 92% of the reads were mapped, and about 58% of the reads in each sample were uniquely mapped to the rice genome in each sample .table  <dig>

according the principle of medip method, analysis of the methylation enrichment in different components of the genome showed that  <dig> kb region upstream and  <dig> kb region downstream of the cpg island and intragenic had enriched more methylation reads, especially, when departing from the cpg island or intragenic regions . furthermore, the upstream 2k and 5’utr or downstream 2k and 3’utr were enriched more reads .figure  <dig>

the cpg observed/expected  ratio of pa64s  and pa64s  was mainly in a range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . there was no significant difference in the cpg  ratio between pa64s and pa64s . however, pa64s had more peaks distributed at cpg  ratios of  <dig> ~  <dig> , while the peaks of pa64s  were inclined to cpg  ratios of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  . the cpg o/e ratio is a widely used parameter to predict the dna methylation level based on c → t transition mechanisms resulting from deamination of mcs over the course of evolution  <cit> . in our study, more peaks of pa64s  were distributed in  <dig> ~  <dig>  , and the methylation level of pa64s  was significant higher than that of pa64s  . these results were consistent with previous studies, showing that genes with higher methylation levels tend to have lower cpg o/e ratios  <cit> .figure  <dig>

to get insight into the dna methylation status of pa64s  and pa64s , rpkms  were calculated for each sample and different elements . the results showed that pa64s had higher methylation level than that of pa64s . and the dna methylation levels between pa64s and pa64s  were observed to be significantly different on the upstream 2k, 5’utr, intron, 3’utr, and downstream 2k regions of the gene body . however, there were not significant differences on cds  of the differential methylated regions .

dna methylation patterns in genes and te regions
comparison of the gene methylation status showed that there were  <dig> genes hypermethylated and  <dig> genes hypomethylated in pa64s . most of these dmrs were observed on the upstream 2k and downstream 2k of genes and many of them were hypermethylated in pa64s  . the number of hypermethylated genes showed significant difference between pa64s  and pa64s  in the upstream2k, 5’utr, 3’utr, and downstream 2k regions comparing with the hypomethylated genes . interestingly, the differentially methylated genes of the cds regions between pa64s  and pa64s  exhibited almost no differences .table  <dig>

validation of medip data by bisulfite sequencing
in this study, the dna methylation patterns of  <dig> dmr-associated genes were selected to carry out bisulfite sequencing for the validation of medip data, including loc_os10g <dig> , loc_os12g <dig> , loc_os03g <dig> , loc_os08g <dig>  and so on . we found that many of the dmr-associated genes showed hyper-methylation in pa64s , and the results were almost in accordance with the medip-seq data . for example, loc_os10g <dig> , loc_os03g <dig> , loc_os06g <dig>  and loc_os04g <dig> exhibited a higher methylation level in pa64s compared with pa64s  . however, the dmr-associated genes loc_os03g <dig>  and loc_os03g <dig>  were observed to be hypomethylation in pa64s .figure  <dig>

association of dna methylation and gene expression
analysis of the relationship between dna methylation and gene expression revealed that hypermethylation in some regions were related to the expression of neighboring genes. dna methylation level of pa64s on the upstream 2k, 5’utr, intron, 3’utr, and downstream 2k regions were hypermethylated compared with pa64s   . correspondingly, many dmr-associated genes may be down-regulated in pa64s .

the dna methylation patterns and gene expression of four dmr-associated genes, namely loc_os03g <dig> , loc_os08g <dig> , loc_os06g <dig>  and loc_os03g <dig> , were further examined in this study . three of these had lower dna methylation levels, but higher expression in pa64s . furthermore, the dmr-associated gene loc_os08g <dig> showed a higher dna methylation level and a lower expression in pa64s  .

expression of the genes involved in brassinosteroid signaling pathway
one of the hypermethylated gene osbim <dig> , which is homolog with bim gene family in arabidopsis, was thought to be involved in br signaling pathway. comparison with the structure of bim <dig> suggested that osbim <dig> had higher similarity to bim <dig> of arabidopsis, with an extended n-terminal domain that was lacking in bim <dig> and bim <dig>  <cit> . comparing the respective genomic loci also supported the idea that osbim <dig> and arabidopsis bim <dig> probably share a more ancestral intron-exon structure . and bim <dig> was reported to be cooperated with bes <dig> to regulate br-induced genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, we postulated that br may participate in regulating male fertility in pa64s. to test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of some genes related to br signaling pathway and the genes that regulated by br. expression analysis of these genes showed that some of them had lower expression in pa64s  , including osbak <dig>  osbzr <dig>  osspl <dig> . the expression of osms <dig>  one of the regulating genes for br signaling in the tapetum and microspore development, was also dramatically reduced in pa64s   .figure  <dig>

gene ontology  and kegg pathway enrichment analysis
in this study, genes that overlapped with the methylation peaks in the upstream 2k, downstream 2k or gene body regions were termed as methylated genes. a total of  <dig>  methylated genes were found in the two samples:  <dig>  in pa64s  and  <dig>  in pa64s . of them,  <dig> methylated genes were identified to be differentially expressed genes between pa64s  and pa64s , and these included  <dig> genes that were hypermethylated and  <dig> genes that were hypomethylated in pa64s  .

we further used wego  to functionally categorize the methylated genes and observed significant differences . many genes enriched hypermethylation in pa64s, such as translation regulator, development process, multi-organism process and so on . the results showed that some genes were significantly down-regulated genes in pa64s , including  <dig> genes for “cellular component” ,  <dig> genes for “molecular function”  and  <dig> genes for “biological process”  . methylated genes tend to be enriched in transferase activity, including transcription regulator as well as electron transporter. with respect to biological processes, the genes are enriched in functions associated with photorespiration, cellular metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial atp synthesis. interestingly, the methylated genes of “response to stimulus” were increased in pa64s  . in contrast, for cellular component, the significantly differentially down-regulated genes in pa64s  were enriched in mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial inner membrane .figure  <dig>

to generate further insight view of pathway perturbation in pa64s  under long day length and high temperature conditions, we performed kegg pathway analysis of the differentially methylated genes. as a result,  <dig> predicted pathways were enriched, including metabolism, circadian rhythm, photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation . through the go term enrichment and kegg pathway analysis of the differentially regulated genes, we observed that certain genes were hypermethylated in pa64s  and that they were involved in photorespiration and mitochondrial atp synthesis pathways. these pathways were closely connected to photosynthesis and energy synthesis. for instance, cytochrome c1- <dig>  was involved in mitochondrial electron transport.

discussion
although global dna methylation surveys have been performed in some plants  <cit> , little studies have been reported about the methylation profiles of ptgms rice  during the fertility transition. in this study, the objective was to perform a genome-wide identification of the methylated genes that affect the sterility-fertility transition in ptgms rice pa64s. to confirm the results from medip-seq, the methylation patterns of twenty regions in each sample were analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. and the methylation levels obtained by the two methods were generally in accord with each other. the read distribution analysis performed in this study found that uniquely mapped reads were enriched in the upstream 2k, 5’utr, 3’utr and downstream 2k regions. in addition, the rice sterile line pa64s had higher methylation level than that of pa64s , and many dmr-associated genes were down-regulated in pa64s .

transposable elements  are abundant features in plant genomes that are frequently marked by cytosine methylation. in this study, we examined many categories of transposable elements from the repbase transposable element annotation database. ltr retroelements are the predominant type of transposable element sequences in plant genomes  <cit> . our results showed that the ltr categories had higher 5mc content in pa64s  than in pa64s . and the line and sine retroelement categories had an increased in 5mc content in pa64s  compared with pas <dig> , although this difference was not significant. previous studies using methylation-deficient mutants have demonstrated that hypomethylation can result in transposable element mobilization  <cit> . the increased 5mc content of tes found in the present study suggested that the operation of adaptive genomic mechanisms might help protect genomes against transposable element spread. it would be of interest to measure the relationship of dna methylation and te elements during the fertility transition of pa64s.

in this study, the dna methylation patterns of twenty dmr-associated genes were validated through bisulfite sequencing and we found that hypermethylation in some regions affected the expression of neighboring genes . although hypermethylated dmr-associated genes did not show significant enrichment of down-regulated genes, there were still some down-regulated genes with higher methylation levels . some flower/anther development related genes were hypermethylated in pa64s , for example, loc_os06g <dig>  and loc_os10g <dig>  . previous studies of a male sterile mutant  in brassica oleracea have demonstrated that ipmi was specifically expressed in anther and filament and was not expressed in cms nils  <cit> . the increased 5mc content in ipmi of pa64s found in the present study might lead to a lower expression of ipmt and most likely disturbed the anther cell wall metabolism. furthermore, photosystem and mitochondrial atp synthesis associated genes, including loc_os12g <dig> , loc_os07g <dig>  and loc_os03g <dig>  were also hypermethyalted in pa64s  . high temperature  and ld  conditions increased the methylation levels of these genes and down-regulated their expression during anther development in pa64s, which might in turn lead to pa64s sterility.

in contrast, some heat shock proteins, such as loc_os08g <dig> , loc_os06g <dig>  were found to be hypomethylated in pa64s  in our study, and the expression level of loc_os06g <dig> was also higher in pa64s  . because heat shock proteins are always expressed in response to stress, their higher expression in pa64s  suggested that the adverse environment might affect anther development. these findings suggested that different environments might regulate the gene expression through dna methylation in the gene body or flanking sequence of fertility associated genes.

in arabidopsis and rice, the br signaling pathway is similar. generally, brs bind the extracellular domain of bri <dig>  and then bri <dig> heteromerizes with the bri1-associated kinase  <dig> . the receptor complex then activates the br-signaling kinases  and inactivates the glycogen synthase kinase-3-like kinase bin <dig>  resulting in nuclear accumulation of unphosphorylated forms of two transcription factors bzr <dig> and bes <dig>  which activate the expression of br-responsive genes  <cit> . in this study, some of the components in br signaling pathway, such as osbri, osbak <dig>  osbzr and osbim <dig> were dramatically reduced in male sterile line pa64s  . our results indicated that br signaling involved in regulating the sterility-fertility transition of pa64s under different environments.

on the other hand, osbim <dig>  showed a higher dna methylation level in pa64s and its expression dramatically reduced . in arabidopsis, bim <dig> and spl <dig> act cooperatively in a common complex or via synergistic pathways to promote male fertility  <cit> . in our study, both osbim <dig> and osspl <dig> were downregulated in pa64s . since osbim <dig> is homolog with bim <dig>  the lower expression level will affect br signaling pathway and then regulated the downstream genes which involved in anther and pollen development. therefore, dna methylation of br signaling related genes may affect the expression of key genes  for anther development, leading to male sterility under long-day and high temperature conditions. however, whether the hypermethylated osbim <dig> directly suppress key genes need to be further investigated.

the go term significant enrichment analysis showed that many genes, including the transposons and retrotransposons, were hypermethylated in pa64s  . for example, loc_os09g <dig>  and loc_os06g <dig>  were observed higher methylation levels in pa64s  than pa64s  . these two genes participate in mitochondrial respiratory chain and facilitate mitochondrial atp synthesis  <cit> . thus, their hypermethylated would affect the energy synthesis during pollen development. another hypermethylated gene loc_os02g <dig>  was an early intermediate in ga biosynthesis  <cit> . other significantly differentially expressed dmr-associated genes included loc_os12g <dig> , loc_os04g <dig>  and loc_os05g <dig> . some studies have reported that the adenine phosphoribosyl transferase activity deficient mutants of arabidopsis thaliana were male sterile due to abortion of pollen development after the meiotic divisions of pollen mother cells  <cit> . the mate  efflux protein family has also been reported to be differentially expressed in sterile and fertile nils of brassica oleracea  <cit> . chalcone synthase catalyzes the initial step of the branch of phenylpropanoid pathway which leads to flavonoids. the absence of chalcone synthase activity was found to have a pleiotropic effect in maize and petunia mutants, and pollen fertility/pollen germination and flavonoid synthesis was disrupted  <cit> . therefore, these differentially expressed genes might be involved in fertility transition.

to uncover the regulatory mechanisms of the fertility transition, the regulatory network of differentially methylated genes was examined in this study. several important pathways were found, including flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, circadian rhythm, photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation . previous studies have reported that flavone and flavonol biosyntheses are associated with pollen development. flavonoids are required for pollen viability in many species  <cit> . in addition, flavonols can promote pollen germination frequency and pollen tube growth in tobacco  <cit> . many higher plants use the day length as an environmental cue to switch from vegetative to reproductive growth and plants with defects in their circadian regulation cannot properly regulate the timing of the floral transition  <cit> . in pgms rice, the circadian rhythm genes osprr <dig> in inflorescences have been reported to directly affect the male sterility transition in nongken 58s  <cit> . in this study, some dmr-associated genes, such as loc_os05g <dig>  and loc_os08g <dig> , were found to be involved in the circadian rhythm. the other three pathways, namely photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation were related to carbon or energy metabolism  <cit> . the down-regulated genes of these pathways in pa64s  may lead to insufficient energy and materials for pollen development. therefore, these five pathways were regarded as potentially related to the fertility transition of pa64s in the present study.

CONCLUSIONS
we systematically investigated the complete dna methylome of photoperiod- and thermo-sensitive male sterile rice peiai 64s under two different environments . from the whole-genome dna metylation map, hypermethylation was observed in pa64s  and many pathways such as circadian rhythm, photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were participated in the fertility transition of pa64s. furthermore, the hypermethylated osbim <dig> may be involved in brassinosteroid signaling pathway and affected the male fertility in pa64s.
