BACKGROUND
fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative, anaerobic opportunistic pathogen from bacteroidaceae family that causes infection by adhering and invading into epithelial cells of mouth and gut, co-aggregating with other pathogenic bacteria and eukaryotic cells followed by modulating host immune responses  <cit> . f. nucleatum is known for its role in periodontitis, appendicitis, gingivitis and invasive infections of head, neck, lung, liver, heart and brain . it is reported as an aetiological agent of osteomyelitis, particularly in head and neck region of the patients, who were already affected by chronic periodontitis or odontogenic abscess  <cit> . f. nucleatum can even pass through umbilical cord and causes pregnancy complications such as preterm birth, stillbirth and neonatal sepsis  <cit> . colonization by highly invasive f. nucleatum in intestine may be considered as useful biomarker for inflammatory bowel disease  diagnosis  <cit> .

whole genome and shotgun sequencing to characterize microbiota composition of colorectal cancer  tumor showed enriched dna sequence of f. nucleatum atcc  <dig>  suspecting its association with crc  <cit> . subsequent studies on cell line and mouse tumor xenograft model showed that adhesion of f. nucleatum via fada to e-cadherin on host cells increases crc tumor growth by altering e-cadherin/β-catenin signaling and activating its downstream proinflammatory responses  <cit> . accelerated colonic tumorigenesis due to f. nucleatum was also evidenced in adenomatous polyposis coli+/−  mice by the generation of nf-kb-driven proinflammatory gene signature shared by human crc  <cit> . studies by tahara et al., suggested its pathogenic role since fusobacterium enrichment is associated with specific molecular subsets of crc such as microsatellite instability , tp <dig> mutation, positivity of cpg island methylator phenotype , hmlh <dig> methylation, chd7/ <dig> mutation  <cit> . in mice, f. nucleatum colonization alters intestinal microbial community by reducing symbiotic flora and increasing opportunistic bacteria and it also induces tumor related host immune cytokines. both, the intestinal microbial structure and host immune defence plays essential role in crc progression . berberine treatment was shown to reverse f. nucleatum mediated imbalance in luminal microbiota and thereby crc growth in vivo studies  <cit> . although no direct evidences available to characterize f. nucleatum as causative agent of crc, these findings suggest the contribution of f. nucleatum enrichment to aggressiveness of crc and its successive selection for designing therapeutic strategies. thus, we focused on an in silico strategy to select target proteins in f. nucleatum which might be suitable for attenuating fusobacterium pathogenicity with potent inhibitors.

computational approaches in particular comparative and subtractive genomics have been extensively used to identify novel drug targets in infectious pathogens. these approaches are powerful, speedy and cost-effective in drug discovery and development processes compared to conventional methods. taking this as an advantage, we implemented subtractive genomics approach  <cit>  to predict drug targets in f. nucleatum which has fetched  <dig> druggable proteins altogether. patients with long term ibd have an increased risk of crc development  <cit> . given the association between f. nucleatum infections and enhanced multiple gene expression in ibd and crc, host-pathogen protein-protein interactions  were predicted to suggest putative targets and to hypothesize the plausible mechanisms in crc progression provoked by f. nucleatum infection.

RESULTS
subtractive genomics approach
the refseq proteome of f. nucleatum atcc  <dig>  encompassing  <dig> protein sequences was retrieved from ncbi bacterial genomes database. the schematic representation of workflow with number of permitted genes at each screening step is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> schematic representation of workflow and the outcome of each step involved in computational subtractive genomics-based target identification in f. nucleatum and prediction of hp-ppis between ibd, crc dataset of host and f. nucleatum




essentiality analysis
database of essential genes  consists of minimal gene set that is indispensable for cellular and organism viability  <cit> . a search for deg homologous sequences in the proteome of f. nucleatum yielded  <dig> hits  with cut-off e-value >1e- <dig> and bit score > <dig>  representing their essentiality for bacterial survival. manual cross-checking of each query protein’s biological function with its attained hit showed that they are similar in function. obtained hits were found to be involved in structural organization, nutritional uptake, pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance and other essential processes for the survival of f. nucleatum.

analysis of virulence factors 
genome sequence studies had reported putative vfs in f. nucleatum  <cit> . however, explored significance of this bacterium in various diseases necessitates the search for novel vfs. thus, we attempted to predict vfs from whole proteome of f. nucleatum by searching against virulence factor database   <cit>  as well as from literature reports of orthologous subspecies . about  <dig> proteins of the whole proteome were found to have hits against vfdb with bit score > <dig> of which,  <dig> proteins alone were recognized as non-redundant to the essential proteins list obtained from deg . among them, the importance of few vfs in bacterial infection is discussed here  hemolysin activation protein – lyses erythrocytes and creates anaerobic environment at the site of infection, attacks immune system of the host  <cit>   fibronectin-binding protein-like protein a – mediate adhesion of pathogen to host cells especially to fibronectin and elastin and helps in invasion  <cit>   choline kinase and choline transport protein – catalyze phosphorylcholine attachment to carbohydrate, releasing cmp in lipopolysaccharide metabolism  <cit>   polysaccharide biosynthesis protein – could protect pathogen by producing resistance to complement-mediated killing by the host  <cit>   γ-polyglutamic acid synthetase – anchors to bacterial surface and helps in its survival in adverse conditions  <cit> .

in addition,  <dig> vfs in f. nucleatum were identified from their homology to the respective proteins in orthologous subspecies such as polymorphum and vincentii  <cit> . among them, only  <dig> vfs were found to be non-redundant to the essential proteins list . these vfs include outer membrane proteins , trat complement resistance protein, transporter, secretion pathway proteins, serine proteases, periplasmic component of efflux system and other. omps of f. nucleatum not only mediate adherence with other pathogenic bacteria and host cells, but also suppress host immune system and induce cell death in lymphocytes thus, protecting tumor cells from immune cell attack  <cit> . trat complement resistance protein and serine proteases also fight against host immune system and thus, enhances resistance of bacterium  <cit> .

resistance protein analysis
resistance causing and drug efflux proteins could act as potential therapeutic targets  <cit> . here, we obtained  <dig> antibiotic resistant genes in f. nucleatum with cut-off e-value of 1e- <dig> by employing antibiotic resistance gene-annotation  tool and from literature search of ortholog subsp. of f. nucleatum. the number of proteins was further narrowed down to  <dig>  as  <dig> were observed either as essential or virulent . some of the noteworthy proteins include acriflavin resistance proteins b, d, e, β-lactamase, multi-drug resistant protein, metal dependent hydrolase, macrolide-efflux protein and zinc metallohydrolase. acriflavin resistance proteins b and e efflux multiple drugs directly to external surface and make the bacteria resistant. however, these proteins cannot efflux basic, hydrophilic aminoglycoside due to their hydrophobic cavity which is accomplished by homolog protein, acrd. f. nucleatum also acquired resistance to β-lactam group of antibiotics like penicillin-g due to its ability to produce β-lactamases  <cit> . genome annotation of five different strains of fusobacterium also revealed the presence of multidrug resistance proteins and β-lactamases, which was consistent with our results obtained from arg-annot.

non-human homologous proteins
the search in f. nucleatum proteome mined  <dig> non-redundant essential, virulence and resistance datasets. however, it is necessary to evaluate homology of these proteins in order to find out non-human homologous proteins and to design pathogen-specific inhibitors  <cit> . blastp search against proteome of homo sapiens retrieved  <dig> non-homolog proteins out of which, only  <dig> were observed to be involved in  <dig> metabolic pathways of f. nucleatum according to kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  mapper . the remaining  <dig> pathway-independent proteins were directly considered for druggability analysis to understand their therapeutic potential.

differential pathway analysis
manual comparison between the enlisted  <dig> metabolic pathways of f. nucleatum and all  <dig> metabolic pathways of human  resulted in only  <dig> pathways that are specific to f. nucleatum. these pathways were found to possess only  <dig> non-redundant proteins .

druggability analysis
a protein is considered as ‘druggable target’ only when binding of small molecule either drug/vaccine modulates its function with beneficiary effects to the host  <cit> .

druggability of pathway-independent proteins
the  <dig> proteins that do not belong to any metabolic pathway of f. nucleatum were found to play a key role in pathway-independent processes such as prokaryotic cytokinesis, drug efflux, dna replication, repair, transcription, translation and colonization in host. hence, we considered them for druggability screening which resulted in only eight proteins with therapeutic characteristics. they are acetoacetate metabolism regulatory protein atoc, acriflavin resistance protein b, cell division protein ftsz, flavodoxin, pseudouridine synthase, putative ribosome biogenesis gtpase rsga, putative trna -2’-o)-methyltransferase and rna polymerase sigma factor siga. functional significance of each of these proteins is mentioned in table  <dig> table  <dig> metabolic pathway-independent druggable proteins



druggability of pathway dependent proteins
from  <dig> pathogen-specific metabolic pathway proteins, only  <dig> proteins involved in  <dig> pathways were observed to be druggable in nature. segregation of these  <dig> proteins into their metabolic pathways revealed that  <dig> of them belong to peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway among which, six were also shared by vancomycin resistance and beta-lactam resistance pathways . further, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway and microbial metabolism in diverse environments had five druggable proteins in each . rest of the pathways possessed only one druggable target protein in each . thus, this study suggested the crucial pathways for survival of f. nucleatum, which can be targeted for drug discovery in pathway centric approach.table  <dig> druggable proteins and their metabolic pathways along with accession number



peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway
from the current study, mura to murg proteins, d-alanine--d-alanine ligase , penicillin-binding protein , cell division protein ftsi of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway were predicted as target proteins in f. nucleatum. mura catalyzes the first committed step of this pathway where it converts udp-n-acetylglucosamine  to udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvate. targeting this protein could be lethal to bacterium as f. nucleatum contains only one copy of mura  <cit> . murb is also an attractive target as it catalyzes the reduction of unag-enolpyruvate  <cit> . murc, d, e and f ligases sequentially attach l-alanine, d-glutamate,  <dig>  6-diaminopimelate and d-alanyl-d-alanine to form udp-murnac-peptide  <cit> . bacteria acquire vancomycin resistance if murf joins d-ala-d-lac or d-ala-d-ser to udp-murnac-tripeptide instead of d-ala-d-ala  <cit> . murg catalyzes glycosyl transfer from udp-glcnac to murnac present in lipid i to produce lipid ii  <cit> . penicillin binding proteins  translocate this lipid ii from cytoplasm to exterior surface of the cell and incorporate into peptidoglycan layer  <cit> . thus, pbp is also an important target protein for inhibitor development  <cit> . these proteins are not only essential for bacterial survival, but also involve in the pathogenesis by interacting with host cytoskeleton  <cit> . hence, targeting this pathway could lead to bacterial lysis by weakening the rigidity and strength of cell wall. moreover, lack of homologous counterpart proteins in human make them an excellent drug targets.

lipopolysaccharide  biosynthesis pathway
in lps biosynthesis pathway, lpxa, lpxc, kdsa, kdsb and gmha were considered as valid targets for drug development. enzymes lpxa and lpxc  contribute to the formation of lipid a which is a conserved core oligosaccharide region of lps molecules. lipid a is responsible for toxic effects of gram-negative bacterial infection. the target protein kdsb  is unique in its direct coupling of kdo  to cytosine monophosphate  in kdo biosynthesis which is a part of lps inner core. another druggable protein obtained in this pathway is gmha  that catalyzes the first step in biosynthesis of adp-l-glycero-d-manno heptose  <cit> . inhibiting gmha would create heptose less core lps leading to enhanced sensitivity of f. nucleatum to even low concentration of novobiocin, detergents and bile salts  <cit> .

subcellular localization
prediction of subcellular localization of druggable targets using various online servers delineated that  <dig> out of  <dig> target proteins were located in cytoplasm while the rest were in membrane . cytoplasmic proteins can be considered for small molecule drug development while membrane or secreted proteins for vaccine development.

host-pathogen protein-protein interactions
as f. nucleatum infects the host through its adherence and invasiveness, insights into hp-ppis could help us to understand the mechanism of infection, disease establishment and to identify putative drug targets. the experimentally verified hp-ppis information is currently limited for f. nucleatum. in our attempt to predict the homology based hp-ppis between f. nucleatum proteome and ibd, crc related protein dataset of human using hpidb yielded  <dig> interactions, participated by  <dig> host and  <dig> pathogenic proteins . predicted interactions were based on homologous hpis detected by experimental methods such as two-hybrid pooling approach, surface plasmon resonance, affinity chromatography, far western blotting, anti-tag co-immunoprecipitation and nuclear magnetic resonance in bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis schu s <dig>  saccharomyces cerevisiae s288c, escherichia coli k- <dig> and e. coli o157:h <dig> organisms collected from intact, mint, biogrid, dip databases. the biological network of predicted hp-ppis is presented in fig.  <dig>  from these hp-ppis, the f. nucleatum interacting partners were reported as putative targets while host interacting partners were validated by enrichment analysis to predict their biological processes.fig.  <dig> biological network of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions are shown using cytoscape. f. nucleatum and host interacting proteins are represented in pink and blue color respectively



enrichment analysis of host proteins
if a set of proteins are significantly enriched in certain biological processes or pathways, they are likely to play similar role in vivo  <cit> . hence, pathway, functional, disease enrichment analysis and functional annotation clustering were carried out to assess predicted hp-ppis using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit> . this analysis resulted in significantly enriched  <dig> pathways,  <dig> gene ontology  terms and  <dig> diseases with minimum count of three gene set and p-value lower than  <dig>  in addition to  <dig> annotation clusters with cut-off enrichment score of >  <dig> and minimum of three terms.

pathway enrichment analysis
this analysis was performed based on the assessment that host proteins involved in hpis possess functional correlation to the pathways that are relevant to pathogen’s infection. among the obtained pathways from david functional annotation chart analysis, wnt signaling pathway, ecm-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, toll-like receptor  signaling and crc probably suggest the role of f. nucleatum in adhesion, invasion into epithelial cells and triggering of signal transduction pathways that promote crc  <cit> . other attained pathways such as t-cell, b-cell receptor signaling, t-cell, b-cell activation, antigen processing and presentation, lck and fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of tcr activation, viral myocarditis indicate the relevance of f. nucleatum infection to host immune responses . f. nucleatum infection inhibits t-cell activation by preventing cells to exit g0/g <dig> phase of cell cycle which may result in local and/or systemic immunosuppression  <cit> . chronic inflammation in periodontal diseases due to f. nucleatum has been reported as potential risk factor for alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . most of the obtained pathways were in accordance to literature reports while the rest of them could be either false positive or may have an indirect effect which seeks further experimental support. this include renal cell, basal cell, small cell lung, non-small cell lung, endometrial, thyroid, pancreatic, acute myeloid leukemia, glioma, leukocyte transendothelial migration and melanoma.

functional and disease enrichment
similar to pathway enrichment analysis, go term analysis of host interacting partners also showed the involvement of f. nucleatum in wnt signaling pathway through β-catenin, t & b cell activation, immune system development, cell differentiation, cytoskeleton and apoptosis. go term analysis also added other processes including cell proliferation, cell motion, membrane invagination, cell cycle control, organ development, tissue cell and organ morphogenesis, receptor & lipid binding, blood vessel development, homeostasis process, embryogenesis, neurogenesis and others which were also supported by literature  .

disease enrichment analysis of host interacting partners showed the association of f. nucleatum with crc, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure, arterial hypertension, alzheimer’s and osteoporosis  . systemic inflammation and immune cross-reactivity due to f. nucleatum infection play a major role in atherogenesis  <cit>  and may increase the risk to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure  <cit> . f. nucleatum may play a role in osteoporosis as it is a strong inducer of osteoclast activity and stimulates bone resorption  <cit> . other diseases such as endometrial, ovarian cancer, melanoma could be either false positive or may share common signaling pathways with other diseases of f. nucleatum.

in order to further validate the results, we performed functional annotation clustering analysis which yielded  <dig> functional clusters . most over-represented terms in this functional cluster analysis were related to focal adhesion, immune responses, cell cycle, cell differentiation & death, wnt, p <dig> pathways and positive regulation of transcription.

based on this enrichment analysis, we hypothesized the possible mechanisms involved in crc progression due to f. nucleatum infection . host epithelial cells detect f. nucleatum infection via tlrs  <cit> . infection by this bacterium damages the gut tissue by inducing nf-kb driven overexpression of inflammatory genes such as collagenase- <dig>  il- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  tgf-α, tgf-β  and tnf-α  <cit> . responding to this damage, epithelial cells stimulate repair and defensive  mechanism by producing antimicrobial peptide, β-defensins  <cit> . however, the bacterium escapes from antimicrobial effects of host and persists inside epithelial cells possibly by interfering with phagosome-endosome system  <cit> . thus, the cycle of tissue damage and repair mechanism continues which might promote tumor induction. besides, overexpression of proinflammatory genes could also facilitate tumor invasion and extravasation by regulating the production and activity of extra cellular matrix degrading proteases. proinflammatory genes may enhance the expression of anti-apoptotic , proliferative genes  and pro-angiogenesis factor  via stat <dig> up-regulation. localized inflammatory microenvironment created by up-regulated inflammatory genes and oxidative damage by ros possibly induces dna mutations and epigenetic changes in host cells. however, host dna repair mechanism unable to restore this damage as f. nucleatum induces the production of kinases involved in dna damage , death-associated protein kinase  <dig>  protein kinase ck- <dig> and cox- <dig>  this results in accumulation of oncogenic or inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as p <dig> and apc. during f. nucleatum adhesion, downregulated expression of e-cadherin by fada binding could lead to epithelial-mesenchymal transition  due to enhanced expression of β-catenin-regulated transcription factors such as lymphoid enhancer factor /t-cell factor , nf-kb, myc and cyclin d. thus, chronic infection of f. nucleatum may alter local cytokine profile, dna repair system, apoptotic, proliferative and immune responses in infected cells and modulates the microenvironment of gut towards crc.fig.  <dig> the plausible mechanisms in crc progression due to f. nucleatum infection may involve increased expression of proinflammatory genes, ros, oncogenes, dna damaging genes and β-catenin signaling which may contribute to accumulation of mutations that promote tumor induction, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition



CONCLUSIONS
a set of proteins that were proposed through this computational approach might act as suitable targets for therapeutic intervention of f. nucleatum. in future, potent inhibitors can be designed to these predicted targets followed by an experimental verification. this might help in treatment of periodontal or other diseases caused by f. nucleatum and to reverse f. nucleatum-induced intestinal microbial imbalance in crc progression. hp-ppis predicted from this study might help in further mechanistic and functional exploration of f. nucleatum infection. pathway, functional and disease enrichment analysis corroborated that predicted hp-ppis were closely correspond to f. nucleatum infection. and the enrichment analysis of host interacting partners suggested that this bacterium might enhance crc progression by affecting multiple signal transduction pathways, immune responses and tumor suppressive genes. thus this study revealed the possible target proteins in f. nucleatum, predicted host-pathogen interacting partners and hypothesized the mechanisms involved in crc progression due to infection of f. nucleatum which altogether may be applied for preventive or complementary therapy against f. nucleatum.
