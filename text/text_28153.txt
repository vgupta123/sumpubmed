BACKGROUND
scorpion venoms are very complex mixtures with hundreds of different components produced by the highly specialized venom glands. the most prominent components of scorpion venoms are the peptides responsible for the neurotoxic effects associated with their sting, for which more than  <dig> different have been described . most of these toxins are structurally related disulphide-rich short proteins , which affect cellular communication by modulating na+ or k+ ion-channels permeability  <cit> . due to their importance in scorpion envenomation and their usefulness as molecular and pharmacological probes for studying ion-channels, most of the work performed to date are focused at these neurotoxins, with relative few other components ever described; among which are heterodimeric phospholipases a <dig> , non-disulphide short peptides with cytolytic activity and a few other functions  <cit> . recent proteomic analyses  <cit>  have documented the overall composition for nine scorpion species, all of them from the family buthidae and most of them belonging to the tityus genus. these analyses confirmed the gross estimation of an average of one hundred different proteins in each one of the venoms  <cit> . approximately half of them comprehend components with molecular masses in the range of commonly found scorpion toxins . these numbers contrast heavily with the known universe of protein components  described to exist in scorpion venoms, from which only about 12% are not classified within the known scorpion toxin families.

further insights into scorpion venom compositions have been achieved by gene cloning by pcr-based methods conducted with cdna libraries. for example, almost one hundred toxin precursors have been sequenced from venom gland libraries of the buthid scorpion mesobuthus martensii . unfortunately the spectrum of sequences obtained through pcr-based approach is limited by the specificity of the pcr primers used. it is worth noticing that although pcr-based methods along with the abundant isolation and characterization of scorpion toxins and, more recently, proteomic profiling of whole venoms, have provided us with a large number of sequences, all these components are secreted from the venom glands. little is known about the biological processes that are taking place inside the venom gland cells. therefore, we elected to use a transcriptome approach to improve the understanding of the composition of hadrurus gertschi venom gland.

the scorpion h. gertschi soleglad  belongs to the family caraboctonidae  <cit>  and is considered no dangerous to humans. h. gertschi is endemic to mexico, occurring exclusively in the state of guerrero, and lives underground in tunnels excavated in the soil. from the venom of this scorpion few components have been isolated and studied: hadrurin, an antimicrobial and cytolytic peptide  <cit> ; hgetx <dig>  a k+ channel blocker  <cit> ; hadrucalcine, a peptide capable of activating skeletal ryanodine receptors , and; the precursors hgescplp and hgeβktx, which encode for long-chain peptides similar to scorpine and βktx's, respectively  <cit> . although hadrurin was reported as component of h. aztecus venom  <cit> , the specimens used in that work were not taxonomically identified and latter it was realized that scorpions from that geographical region should be named h. gertschi; this species assignment was confirmed by identification of relevant taxonomic keys in the specimens.

in the present work we randomly generated and analyzed  <dig> expressed sequence tags  from a cdna library of the venom gland of h. gertschi. these  <dig> ests corresponded to  <dig> % of the whole non-amplified cdna library and were generated from a non-normalized cdna library. after clustering the resulting dataset, we identified transcripts possibly associated with different cellular functions. the possible roles of some of the transcripts are discussed, although many have unknown functions. furthermore, we present  <dig> full length sequences of new toxins.

single-pass gene sequencing from cdna libraries is an affordable strategy to mine the transcript profile of a given tissue  <cit> . this strategy has been used to analyze the transcripts profiles for few other venomous organisms, such as cnidarians  <cit> , cone snails  <cit> , fishes  <cit> , snakes  and spiders  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an ests strategy conducted with any scorpion venom gland. moreover, this is the first comprehensive molecular study of a non-buthid scorpion, which could serve for comparative purposes when studying the details of the process by which buthid scorpions have been assembling their neurotoxic arsenal.

RESULTS
cdna library and est analysis
the h. gertschi venom gland library constructed was not amplified ; therefore the cluster size might reflect the relative abundance of the corresponding mrna population . after sequencing,  <dig> electropherograms were submitted to bioinformatics analysis to remove vector and poor quality sequences, resulting in  <dig> high-quality ests which were used to analyze gene expression profile in the h. gertschi venom glands. the mean read length of ests was  <dig> nucleotides . after clusterization  <dig> clusters showing more than one est and  <dig> singlets were grouped . among the  <dig> ests, in 29%  we were unable to identify any open reading frame . the remaining sequences encode for protein precursors with an average of  <dig> residues . the complete dbest submission with  <dig> nucleotide sequences and annotations is included in additional file  <dig> as raw text.

similarity searches and sequence annotation
all sequences were submitted for blastn and blastx searches against nr database; an e-value < 10- <dig> was used as cut-off for confidential homologue detection. in addition to the ests for which no clear orf have been identified, nearly 19% of the new sequences  do not match with any entry in the database. altogether, unassigned ests account for close to 48% of the total dataset, a value similar to other transcriptome studies which show values varying from 13% to 56% of non matched sequences  <cit> . noteworthy, these putative gene products signify a source of new information about scorpion venom gland specific genes. in addition to ests with no database match,  <dig> reads presented identity with sequences that have been already described but with no functional assessment, hereby named unknown proteins. one of these, hge032| <dig>  is the clone which codes for a protein similar to the cg9896-like proteins identified in the scorpions mesobuthus gibbosus and m. cyprius. the other one, hge033| <dig>  encodes for a scorpion homologue of short proteins conserved in eukaryotic organisms , but whose function is not known yet.

the identified putative proteins  were assorted into two main groups : 1) precursors similar to gene products implicated in common cellular processes account for 18% of transcripts  and; 2) putative toxins or other venom components, representing 31% of total ests . for most of these sequences, the putative identity deposited into the dbest correspond to the eukaryotic orthologous group  each would belong , with relevant gene ontology  terms assigned with the aid of amigo and goblet  <cit>  web servers.

it is worth noticing that in the group of identified proteins, toxins account for  <dig> % of the transcripts . the distribution of all ests is depicted in figure  <dig>  it can be observed that ests coding for toxins are well represented in the h. gertschi venom gland transcriptome. further, considering the non-matched ests as a possible source for new toxins, it can be assumed that these molecules are preferentially expressed over proteins related with the other cellular functions.

go-sorted annotated sequences
all non-toxin nr-matched gene products were annotated in each of the three ontologies of go: cellular component , molecular function  and biological processes . within each of these ontologies the categories with highest prevalence are: "intracellular" , "ribosome" , "mitochondrion"  and "extracellular part"  within cc; "catalytic activity" , "hydrolase activity" , "protein binding"  and "ion binding"  within mf, and; "primary metabolic process" , "biosynthetic process" , "transport"  and "translation"  within bp .

discussion
transcriptome analysis suggest cellular processes relevant for scorpion venom glands function
although our sampling of the venom glands library is still incomplete, the diversity and nature of the annotated transcripts provide the first glimpse about molecular processes taking part in the scorpion venom gland cells. since we constructed a non-amplified library, it could be expected that clone number reflects the actual prevalence of a given transcript. moreover, by extension, different transcripts belonging to the same – confidentially assigned – go category might suggest this category as important within the biological processes of scorpion venom glands.

for example, intuitively, the venom glands should support high protein synthesis and secretion in order to produce the large amounts of, secreted and renewable, venom proteins. in concordance,  <dig> % of the total transcripts and  <dig> % of the unique sequences match with either ribosomal components  or proteins involved in cellular trafficking . both processes are energetically costly and, consistently,  <dig> % of whole ests and  <dig> % of identified protein precursors match with components of the energy-producer organelle mitochondrion, whereas  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, are putative homologues of proteins directly involved in the energy-producer oxidative phosphorilation or tricarboxilyc acid cycle. indeed, scorpions whose venoms were artificially depleted shows increased oxygen consumption  <cit> .

the importance of correct protein processing in the context of scorpion venom gland is emphasized by the presence of transcripts encoding for proteins involved in correct folding , posttranslational processing  or proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins . one of these , match with aminopeptidases of the m <dig> family , which are exopeptidases involved in the processing and regular turnover of intracellular proteins, although their precise role in cellular metabolism is unclear. in particular aminopeptidases of the m <dig> family cleave leucine residues from the n-terminal of polypeptide chains, but substantial rates are evident for all amino acids  <cit> . we predicted, by signalp  <dig> , its signal peptide-processing sequence  suggesting that this transcript is secreted as a venom component, and indeed it could be important for posttranslational modifications of venomous gland components. moreover, hge018| <dig> match with the glycosylating enzymes β- <dig> -mannosyltransferases ; which is consistent with the presence of glycosylated proteins in scorpion venoms .

an interesting finding in our database was a transcript encoding the ribonuclease h domain of a non-ltr retrotransposon  of clade r <dig> . this nltrrt clade is usually found inserted into telomeres and has been identified in several arthropods  and some fungi  <cit> . it is worth noticing that mobile elements and their remnants account for large proportions of most eukaryotic genomes, in which they have had central roles in genome evolution and hypervariation. the expression of transposases indicates that mobile elements might contribute to the diversification of venom toxins. recently, glushkov et al.,  <cit>  reported the search for nltrrt in  <dig> scorpion species, in which degenerate oligonucleotides based on consensus sequences of seven clades of nltrrt were used to a pcr-based fishing approach. unfortunately, even though these authors reported that pcr products of the expected size where obtained with r1-based degenerate primers, they only presented data for cr <dig>  i and jockey nltrrt clades.

toxins and other venom components
our h. gertschi scorpion venom gland library is clearly enriched on toxin-like sequences, with more than 17%  of the sequenced ests being similar to known families of scorpion toxins. another 14% of the total ests  encodes for precursors which are homologues of previously characterized non-toxin scorpion venom components . considering that all these sequences contain putative signal peptides – identified by signalp  <dig>   <cit>  – and their relative abundance, we suggest that these ests may encode secreted venom components. in fact,  <dig> of these clusters encode peptides already found in the venom of h. gertschi, which are currently being studied by our group .

α-ktxs
two clusters encoding potential α-ktx peptides  <cit>  were found and their translated sequences are shown in figure  <dig> . one of those  is composed by  <dig> reads, and the other one  by  <dig> reads. although the blastx search against public databases showed that hge024|contig <dig> sequence presents poor e-values  with haemocyte defensins of insects and with some ocktx's – predicted k+ channel toxins from the scorpion opistophthalmus carinatus  <cit> , psi-blast  <cit>  with the translated sequence retrieved most of the members of the α-ktx  <dig> subfamily  within the first three iterations with good expectance values. therefore, we propose that hge024|contig <dig> constitutes the precursor of a novel member of this subfamily of k+ channel blockers. similarly, the search of hge025|contig <dig> sequence against database revealed low similarity with anuroctoxin  from the scorpion anuroctonus phaiodactylus, a high-affinity blocker of kv <dig>  channels of human t lymphocytes  <cit> . again, the expectancy values were rather poor, but in this case, we were already able to purify the mature peptide from the venom of h. gertschi, and it is now under study. the prediction of its signal peptide and the n-terminal amino acid sequence determined by automatic edman degradation  reveal that this toxin is in fact produced as a propeptide. this encode for a  <dig> amino acid-long peptide, containing three segments: an n-terminal signal peptide of  <dig> amino acid residues, a putative propeptide of 6-amino acids and a mature peptide containing  <dig> residues . the mature peptide encoded by hge025|contig <dig> shows several conserved features of α-ktx peptides, nonetheless its sequence is quite unique. we suspect that it might be the first member of a new αktx subfamily, but this remains to be clarified by ongoing analyses.

β-ktx and scorpine-like peptides
one cluster  coding the hgeβktx and another  coding the hge scorpine like were identified in the transcriptome of h. gertschi and their sequence have already been reported  <cit> . here we present a distinct est, homologous to the scorpine-like group of long-chain three disulphide-bridged scorpion venom peptides, named hge scorpine like  <dig> .

cytolytic peptides
two clusters encoding isct-like precursors were found in h. gertschi transcriptome. isct and isct <dig> are antimicrobial linear peptides isolated from the scorpion opisthacanthus madagascariensis  <cit> . they possess broad activity spectra against gram positive and negative bacteria as well as fungi and relatively weak haemolytic activity against sheep red blood cells. additionally to the signal peptide, their precursors contain an uncommon acidic propeptide at the c-terminal . figure 5a shows both isct-like translated sequences, the more abundant comprising  <dig> reads and the other one represented by  <dig> reads, classified as non-disulfide-bridged peptides  ndbp- <dig>  and ndbp- <dig> , respectively .

bradykinin-potentiating peptide like
one cluster  encodes a homologue of the bradykinin-potentiating peptide precursor  from the scorpion mesobuthus martensii, classified as ndbp- <dig>   <cit> . the angiotensin-bradykinin system is a central hormonal system for the regulation of blood pressure. the angiotensin-converting enzyme  converts angiotensin i to angiotensin ii and degrades bradykinin. bradykinin potentiating peptides have been isolated from tityus serrulatus  and buthus occitanus . peptide t, a 13-amino acid linear peptide, potentiates the contractile activity of bradykinin on isolated smooth muscle, inhibits the hydrolysis of bradykinin by ace, and enhances the depressor effect of bradykinin on arterial blood pressure in the anesthetized rats  <cit> . peptide k <dig> displays similar bradykinin potentiating activities  <cit> . bmkbpp was identified from b. martensii karsch by cdna cloning based on the peptide k <dig> amino acid sequence  <cit> . the last  <dig> residues of c-terminal region of bmkbpp showed 57% similarity with peptide k <dig>  based on the fact that bmkbpp also exhibits high similarity with parabutoporin and others antimicrobial peptides from scorpions, it was suggested that bmkbpp may be a molecule with a dual-function, and that the bmkbpp precursor may be processed in two alternative ways to produces two different mature molecules: bmkbpp and a peptide with only the c-terminal  <dig> residues of bmkbpp  <cit> . figure 5b shows the bradykinin-potentiating peptide like from h. gertschi, here named ndbp- <dig> .

phospholipases
a cluster  of a new homologue of scorpion venom phospholipases a <dig>  was identified in the h. gertschi library . the mature form of scppla <dig> are composed by two subunits, the large ones consisting of approximately  <dig> amino acid residues, whereas the small subunits have between  <dig> and  <dig> residues; their heterodimeric form is stabilized by one interchain disulphide bridge  <cit> . the scppla <dig> are expressed from a single message, from which the n-terminal propeptide, a penta or hexapeptide internal segment and a short c-terminal region are excised to give the heterodimeric mature form of the enzyme. in figure  <dig>  these regions are identified on the sequence of the predicted h. gertschi pla2; the assignment was based on multiple sequence alignment of known scppla <dig>  pla2s are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn- <dig> acyl bonds of sn- <dig> phospholipids, and are normal cellular mediators involved in different responses, such as inflammation, blood hemostasis and others. many animal venoms posses pla2s that mediate several toxic responses, like cytotoxicity, neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, edema and blood coagulation disturbs. based on their primary structure, these toxins can be classified in tree distinct classes: class i is found in elapidae snakes venom; class ii is found in the viperidae family of snakes; and class iii that was identified for the first time in the bee venom. latter they were found in other invertebrates such as jellyfish, marine snails, and scorpion venoms, but they are also present in vertebrates, like the venomous lizard heloderma  <cit> .

kunitz-type carboxypeptidase inhibitor
one est , is homologous to kog <dig>  which contains serine proteinase inhibitors of the kunitz type . proteins with ku have been identified in several venomous organisms, like snakes  <cit> , sea anemones  <cit> , cone snails  <cit>  and spiders  <cit> . however, this is the first report of a ku-type precursor in scorpions. figure  <dig> shows the multiple sequence alignment of hge030|hg <dig> with other ku-type venom components. although the precise role of hge030|hg <dig> in the context of scorpion venom remains to be determined – whether it display neurotoxic or proteinase inhibitor activity –, the ubiquitous presence of proteinase inhibitors suggest a common trend in venomous organisms, deserving further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
gene cloning of animal toxins has been extensively performed by pcr method, using primers deduced from direct protein sequencing, usually by edman degradation or mass spectrometry analysis. these studies are aimed at the isolation of specific active components. however, this approach is not entirely suitable for search of unforeseen components that could be present in the venomous gland under study. the strategy is biased by the fact that only those genes that are sharing sequence similarities are usually discovered by this technique. for this reason, we adopted the molecular approach of generating and analyzing ests from the h. gertschi venom gland as the strategy to produce a general overview of the venom gland transcriptome. this strategy confirms the highly specialized nature of scorpion venom glands as toxin-producer, allowing the description, for the first time, of putative proteins that certainly are involved in cellular processes relevant for the venom glands' function. additionally, the unguided mining also reveals novel predicted venom components, highlighting the usefulness of the transcriptome approach to improve venom profiling.
