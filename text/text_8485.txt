BACKGROUND
among emerging evolutionary and ecological model organisms, the passion-vine butterfly genus heliconius  offers particularly exciting possibilities for integrative research into the genetic and developmental basis of adaptive variation  <cit> . the genus, composed of around  <dig> species with hundreds of geographic variants, couples color pattern divergence with multiple cases of mimicry-related convergent evolution  <cit> . the wing color patterns of heliconius are adaptations that warn potential predators of the butterflies' unpalatability  <cit>  and also play an important role in speciation  <cit> . nearly all heliconius species participate in local müllerian mimicry associations and, in any one area, the wing color patterns of different aposematic butterfly species converge into a handful  of clearly differentiated mimetic assemblages  <cit> . the color patterns characterizing many of these mimicry rings often change dramatically every few hundred kilometers. this pattern of convergent and divergent evolution in heliconius is best exemplified by the mimetic relationship between h. erato and h. melpomene. the two species are distantly related within the genus and never hybridize  <cit> , yet, where they co-occur, local races possess nearly identical wing patterns and have undergone parallel and congruent radiations into over  <dig> geographic races  <cit> .

the multiple radiations of mimetic color patterns, particularly the parallel radiations of h. erato and h. melpomene, provide "natural experiments" for comparative studies into the genetic and developmental basis of adaptive change. in this paper, we describe a simple strategy that integrates growing genomic resources in heliconius to identify regions of the genome near the loci that modulate wing pattern variation in h. erato. our strategy relies on the fact that large phenotypic differences within species are caused by a handful of major effect loci  <cit>  and that crosses can be designed that allow researchers to unambiguously follow the segregation of alleles at these loci  <cit> . by scanning through thousands of aflp polymorphisms in these crosses we can identify markers tightly associated with particular color pattern genes. these markers are then used to probe newly available bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries and allow us to obtain large sections of genomic sequence around color pattern genes. these targeted genomic sequences provide the first insights into the architecture of the h. erato genome including details on gene density, repeat structure and, with sequence information from homologous regions of the h. melpomene genome, the preservation of fine-scale gene order between the two co-mimics. these data facilitate comparative mapping work on the genetic basis of color pattern variation and convergence in heliconius, including efforts to positionally clone the color pattern genes themselves. these data also provide some of the first information on patterns of microsynteny in lepidopteran genomes, complementing recent work showing marked patterns of synteny conservation at a macro scale between h. melpomene and the silk moth bombyx mori  <cit> .

we are focusing our research efforts on two major color pattern loci, d and cr, which underlie much of the observed pattern variation in h. erato. both genes are unlinked and alleles at the different loci interact to cause phenotypic shifts across large areas of the wing surface, changing the position, size and shape of red/orange/yellow and melanic patches on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the forewings and hindwings. alleles at the d locus primarily act by switching scale color between black  and red/orange   <cit> . in contrast, alleles at cr control the positioning of melanin across both the forewing and hindwing, thereby either exposing or covering underlying white and yellow pattern elements . the two loci strongly interact to control the size, shape, and position of both the forewing band and hindwing bar of many races of h. erato  <cit> .

crossing experiments among the various races of h. erato and h. melpomene have shown that the genetic basis of the color pattern radiations is similar in these species  <cit> . in both, a small number of major effect loci, or complex of tightly linked loci, modulate much of the intraspecific pattern variation. furthermore, the phenotypic effects of many of the major patterning genes are often quite similar between the two species  <cit> . for example, cr in h. erato and the n/yb/sb complex in h. melpomene control most of the variation in yellow and white pattern elements in different mimic races of the two species  <cit> . similarly, variation in the major red pattern elements on the forewing and hindwing of h. erato and h. melpomene can be explained by variation at an unlinked gene, d, in h. erato and the similarly named d/b complex, in h. melpomene. in contrast, in h. melpomene these switch genes represent clusters of tightly linked elements separated by one cm or less  <cit> . comparative mapping experiments have shown that the yb complex in h. melpomene and the cr locus in h. erato, which have analogous phenotypic effects, map to the homologous regions of their respective genomes  <cit> .

there were three primary goals for the study presented here. first, we sought to identify molecular markers linked to the h. erato color pattern genes d and cr. second, we used some of these molecular markers to identify and sequence bac clones containing genomic sequences linked to these color pattern genes. lastly, we analyzed selected bac sequences in order to better understand fine-scale characteristics of the h. erato genome and to make comparisons with homologous genomic sequences in h. melpomene and b. mori. ultimately we found that synteny is highly conserved between heliconius species, and even between heliconius and b. mori. we also observed relatively low gene density coupled with a high frequency of novel repeat elements in the heliconius genomic sequences. together, our data show that comparative genomic analysis between lepidopterans is highly tractable, and that positional cloning of genes underlying color pattern variation in heliconius should be possible using standard methods.

RESULTS
identification of markers tightly linked to color pattern genes
we examined  <dig> aflp h. erato polymorphisms using  <dig> primer combinations . the number of aflp bands per gel ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> with a mean of  <dig> bands per primer combination. of these, approximately 84% were polymorphic in our outbred f <dig> cross. the experiment-wide error rate for our screen was approximately  <dig> %, as inferred from discrepancies among female informative  markers. in total, we scored  <dig> male informative  and  <dig> backcross informative  loci. assuming an estimated h. erato genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> , and assuming that aflp markers are distributed randomly, suggests that we surveyed polymorphisms at approximately  <dig> kb intervals across the genome. this would suggest a resolution of  <dig>  cm assuming that the relationship between physical and recombination distance is  <dig> kb/cm  <cit> .

our genome scan identified several aflp markers 1– <dig> cm away from d. for the other gene, cr, previous work using an identical strategy on crosses of h. melpomene provided markers within one cm of this gene in h. erato  <cit> . in total, we identified five aflp loci within a  <dig> cm target window around the d locus. across our h. himera × h. erato notabilis mapping family for d, three loci  were perfectly linked and two loci  showed only one recombinant. we cloned and sequenced several of these aflp loci and developed pcr primers to amplify them from genomic dna. interestingly, two aflp bands tightly linked to the d gene, mi_ecocc-msecac- <dig> bp, mi_ecocc-msecac- <dig>  were allelic variants of the same locus.

identification of bac clones containing color pattern-linked aflps
we screened the h. erato bac library with d-linked  and cr-linked  probes. in our screens with these and other probes , we consistently observed between  <dig> and  <dig> pcr-confirmed positives per probe, suggesting the h. erato bac libraries have approximately 10× genome coverage. the largest clones identified from the d-linked and cr-linked probing experiments were sequenced at 8× coverage. the d-linked clone  was composed of two large sequences that could easily be orientated to produce an approximately  <dig> kb genomic fragment . similarly, sequence of the cr-linked clone  was composed of two large sequences that together spanned approximately  <dig> kb . the probe sequences were clearly identifiable in the d-linked and cr-linked bacs and linkage to color pattern genes was confirmed by mapping .

chromosome walk in the cr region
from the sequence of the first cr-linked bac, identified with the βggt-ii gene, we designed additional probes to use for a second round of bac library screening. specifically we generated two more probes, corresponding to the genes trehalase <dig> and b <dig>  to expand our walk on both directions. with this strategy we identified new bacs on the 3' end that were positive for b <dig> and negative for trehalase <dig> and others on the 5' end positive for βggt-ii and negative for trehalase <dig>  after fingerprinting we selected one bac to sequence from each end. ultimately, bbam-27d <dig> extended the overall contig by  <dig> kb on the 3' end, while bbam-12k <dig> extended the contig on the 5' for  <dig> kb .

high frequency of novel repetitive elements in the heliconius genome
the d- and cr-linked bac sequences were at-rich  and contained many repeats . although all three major classes of transposable elements  were present in the genomic sequences , the vast majority of repetitive sequences showed no significant blast similarity  to any of the insect genomes currently available ncbi databases nor to any arthropod transposable elements listed in repbase  <cit> . heliconius-specific repetitive sequences corresponded to the nine core motifs identified with repeatfinder ). of the nine motifs, six are present in both h. erato and h. melpomene, two are unique to h. erato, and one is unique to h. melpomene ).

summary of identification and repeat masking of repetitive elements in bac sequences from h. erato  and h. melpomene . a) repetitive elements identified via similarity to previously described sequences. b) novel repetitive elements unique to heliconius identified de novo using the repeatmasker software ). each core motif is a summary sequence representing a different and unique set of related repeat sequences. motifs four and five were not observed in h. melpomene; motif nine was not oberseved in h. erato. core motifs  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> were identified by repeatfinder only in h. erato but masked by repeatmasker in h. melpomene. .

gene density in heliconius bac sequences
gene density appeared to be relatively low across both the cr- and the d-linked genomic regions. although there were a moderate number of predicted open reading frames  over  <dig> amino acids long , few showed any similarity to known proteins or lepidopteran ests, including our own collection of nearly  <dig>  heliconius ests . for example, across the d-linked bac we identified  <dig> hypothetical proteins using the kaikogaas annotation tool and our own blast analysis. over 90%, however, were less than  <dig> amino acids in length, only one of which showed similarity to any known or predicted protein. across the entire ~ <dig> kb region near the d locus in h. erato there were only two hypothetical proteins that showed significant homology to a known protein or contained a known structural element. one was similar to a sequence in our est collection , while the other showed strong homology to a lepidopteran methionine-rich larval storage protein . although there was a smaller absolute number of predicted proteins across the cr-linked bac, there were more than twice as many predicted proteins of amino-acid length greater than  <dig> across, all but one of which showed strong homology to known proteins or to heliconius ests . overall, the gene density we observed in h. erato is similar to what has been observed in the repeat-rich heterochromatin domains of drosophila melanogaster, which averages  <dig>  genes per  <dig> kb   <cit> .

annotation summary for four h. erato bacs . predicted gene function and blastp data  are reported, as are accession numbers of the h. erato, h. melpomene, and b. mori genomic sequences containing the predicted genes. 

fine-scale microsynteny between h. erato and h. melpomene genomic sequences
vista analysis  <cit>   showed a 35% conservation between the  <dig> kb h. erato cr-linked bac clone  and the homologous sequence from h. melpomene . all of the predicted genes showed strong similarity  between the two species and perfect overall synteny . furthermore, a significant portion of  <dig> kb of presumed non-coding sequence  was highly conserved between the two species . despite the overall conservation between h. erato and h. melpomene sequences, two ests did show a difference between the species. firstly, hec <dig> was found only in h. erato, and corresponded to a large indel sequence. also, hec <dig> was found in the h. melpomene bac sequence but not the h. erato sequence, although it shared some similarity with an exon of the forkhead gene in the h. erato bac sequence. for hec <dig>  it is likely that the h. erato bac sequence did not extend far enough to cover the homologus genomic region containing the gene in h. melpomene.

conservation of gene order between h. erato and b. mori
we found evidence for fine-scale synteny between h. erato and b. mori in the  <dig> kb genomic region linked to the cr color pattern gene . no evidence for microsynteny was observed between d-linked h. erato genomic regions and b. mori, due to the lack of conserved genes in the d-linked clone. b. mori scaffold sequence , downloaded from silkdb  <cit> , contained all of the major genes annotated on the cr-linked bac clones . all genes were unambiguously identified: βggt-ii ; glucose dehydrogenase ; forkhead box ; trehalase <dig> ; trehalase <dig> ; b <dig> ; unkempt ; beta fructosidase frua . with the exception of the dna helicase , which appears to have been translocated, all of the gene orders and distances in heliconius and b. mori are highly conserved. for example, glucose dehydrogenase and forkhead box were separated by  <dig> bp in h. erato and  <dig> bp in b. mori, while trehalase <dig> and trehalase <dig> were separated by  <dig> bp in h. erato and  <dig> bp in b. mori. all seven genes showed 70–85% nucleotide acid sequence similarity between species . in addition to the major genes, there were many other genomic regions between heliconius and b. mori with a nucleotide acid sequence similarity higher than 85% that did not show blast similarities to any known proteins.

discussion
high levels of fine-scale genomic conservation between heliconius species
we have previously demonstrated that the cr locus in h. erato and the yb gene of h. melpomene map to homologous areas of the genome  <cit> . bac genome sequence data for a region tightly linked to the yb gene was obtained from h. melpomene using methodology similar to that described here. a single gene marker developed from the h. melpomene sequence mapped close to the cr locus in h. erato. here we provide the first genomic sequence evidence that, across a broad region around this gene, gene order and gene content is conserved. across a  <dig> kb overlapping region all putative proteins showing high similarity to known proteins were in the same order in the two co-mimics . this further supports the hypothesis that a homologous gene, or set of genes, is responsible for color pattern variation in the two species. indeed, with the exception of two large orfs with strong sequence similarity to a reverse transcriptase , gene order in the cr-linked h. erato region and the n/yb/sb-linked h. melpomene region was nearly perfectly preserved. furthermore, many of the smaller orfs, as well as some non-coding sequence, were highly conserved both in the relative order and sequence. generally, the h. erato and h. melpomene genomes appear to be structurally very similar. because of this, linkage analyses and positional cloning efforts in each individual species should be highly informative for the co-mimetic species, and probably for the genus as a whole.

the difference in h. erato and h. melpomene genome sizes
one of the most obvious differences between the h. erato and h. melpomene genomic sequences was the larger physical distance between homologous anchor points in h. erato relative to h. melpomene. this observation was probably related to the fact that the genome of h. erato is about 30% larger than that of h. melpomene  <cit> . in this respect, it was notable that the difference in genome sizes between the two species was roughly proportional to the size of a number of sequence blocks that are absent in h. melpomene relative to h. erato in our genomic sequences . many of these blocks were comprised of heliconius-specific repetitive sequences, or showed strong similarity to known mobile genetic elements. these indel blocks appeared to be primarily noncoding sequences because none of them contained protein-coding sequences, with the exception of one est  and a reverse transcriptase.

differences in the genome size between closely related species is common and is usually associated with differences in abundance of different classes of noncoding dna  <cit> . it has been suggested that the insertion and replication of repetitive elements, as well as indel biases, can lead to profound differences in genome size  <cit> . our observations suggest that both of these effects might be relevant in heliconius, however, the differences in amount of repetitive dna sequences in indels, at least over the small region that we examined, were not large enough to completely account for the differences in the genome size of the two species.

novel repetitive elements in heliconius
using repeatfinder  <cit>  and repeatmasker  <cit> , we identified  <dig> different repeated elements in the heliconius genomic sequences . in total, repetitive sequences accounted for about 20% of the h. melpomene and about 26% of the h. erato genomic sequence. seven of these repeated elements corresponded to previously described sequences . because we were unable to detect any of the remaining nine repeats  in public sequence databases we assume these nine repeats represent novel repetitive elements unique to the heliconius genus ). the seven previously described elements were larger  relative to the nine novel elements  and occurred much less frequently. most instances of these novel repeats observed in the bac sequences were intact, full-length, highly similar versions of the core motifs. however, a wide range of fragmentation and divergence relative to the core motifs was also observed among repetitive regions. motif # <dig> in h. erato best exemplifies this pattern, as it was the most abundant repeat observed, with  <dig> bac regions showing significant similarity to the  <dig> bp core motif. these regions ranged continuously in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and in divergence from 2% to 32%. all other motifs showed a qualitatively similar pattern where bac regions corresponding to a novel element ranged from being highly similar to the core motif sequence to being fragmented and divergent. this pattern is consistent with a process of motif replication and insertion followed by mutational degradation, suggesting these novel repeat motifs likely represent some sort of transposable element such as short interspersed nuclear elements  or miniature inverted-repeat terminal elements   <cit> . both sines and mites have been reported from lepidoptera  <cit> . more work is required to confidently determine the origin of these novel repetitive sequences in heliconius. we are hopeful that future genomic sequences from other butterfly species will allow a better understanding the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary origins of some of the observed repeats.

preliminary evidence for fine-scale synteny between heliconius and bombyx
the observed fine scale synteny within heliconius complements a recent study showing that patterns of macrosynteny are strongly conserved across the macrolepidoptera  <cit> . this previous study demonstrated that a total of  <dig> markers mapped in h. melpomene and b. mori showed large-scale patterns of synteny across the genome . our data further suggests that synteny has been preserved between heliconius and b. mori on a much finer scale. specifically, we show here that seven predicted genes in the cr region have a similar order in the homologous b. mori genomic sequence . although this is a very small sampling of the genome as a whole, it is still notable that gene order, as well as intergenic distances, has been preserved over such a long time scale.

chromosome walking towards heliconius color pattern genes
the goal of this study was to identify and characterize regions of the genome linked to wing pattern polymorphism in heliconius butterflies. we did not necessarily expect these initial bac sequences to contain the color pattern genes themselves, however, these sequences provide important genomic "anchors" for ongoing positional cloning work. fine-scale mapping experiments imply that we are very near the d and cr color pattern loci. a microsatellite marker at the 5' end of the d-linked bac showed  <dig> recombinants across  <dig> individuals, suggesting that this end is about  <dig>  cm from the gene. there were two fewer recombinants for a marker developed from exon sequence of the methionine rich storage protein  gene at the 3' end of the bac. this marker is about  <dig> kb from our 5' microsatellite marker, suggesting that d is a further  <dig> cm in the 3' direction. we appear to have come down even closer to the cr gene. in this case, a marker developed from the βggt-ii gene near the 5' of the bbam-38a <dig> bac clone showed no recombinants across  <dig> individuals. a similar result was obtained with a marker developed from the putative dna helicase rec-q in the middle of the bbam-27d <dig> bac clone, suggesting that the zero recombinant interval might be somewhat large. for this reason, given an expected relationship of physical to recombination distance of  <dig> kb/cm  <cit> , an expectation consistent with our initial mapping results, we are optimistic to identify the genomic recombinant interval containing both genes with the next one  to three  bac steps.

in terms of identifying color pattern genes, there are obvious practical benefits of a fine-scale preservation of gene order between species. foremost, conservation should greatly facilitate the identification of functional genes and the discovery of some regulatory elements associated with these genes  <cit> . indeed, there were numerous conserved regions that were not simply protein coding regions . even though this analysis covers only a small portion of the heliconius genome, it confirms, for the first time, at a fine scale level what has been seen in comparative mapping projects concerning gene order conservation between different species in the genus  <cit> .

a comparative approach will be particularly important for pinpointing the regions responsible for pattern variation in heliconius. pattern formation in heliconius probably involves discrete changes in conserved protein coding or regulatory regions  <cit> . there is little precedent for what to expect, however, variation in pattern formation could be controlled by a number of cis-regulatory elements of a single gene, clusters of duplicated genes with divergent function, or clusters of non-paralogous but functionally-related genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the mimetic wing patterns of heliconius stand out as one of the best examples of an adaptive radiation. we are using a strategy that couples growing genomic resources with high-resolution linkage analysis in order to gain a fuller appreciation of the genetic basis of this radiation. we have identified regions of the heliconius genome tightly linked to genes that modulate pattern variation and, for one of these regions, we have demonstrated the fine-scale preservation of gene order between distantly-related heliconius species and across lepidoptera . this conservation is significant because it will greatly facilitate efforts for gene identification through parallel and complementary efforts in different species. it is our hope that further fine-scale mapping, complemented by targeted genomic sequencing, will allow us to identify the genes that underlie wing pattern variation and diversity in the genus heliconius.
