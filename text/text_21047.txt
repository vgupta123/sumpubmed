BACKGROUND
as reported by the world health organization, seasonal influenza is responsible for approximately  <dig> million cases of infection and between  <dig>  to  <dig>  deaths each year  <cit> . currently, vaccination remains the most proficient strategy to prevent infection and to battle the persistent threat of influenza epidemics. egg-based production has remained the standard method to produce seasonal influenza vaccines since the 1950s; however, the serious threat of an outbreak of pandemic avian flu and the influenza h1n <dig> pandemic of  <dig> have highlighted the limitations associated with this manufacturing method  <cit> . these drawbacks include the dependence on the availability of eggs for production and their associated limitations with regards to scalability , the relatively long 6-month period from strain isolation to final dose formulation and validation  <cit> , and the difficulties with growing isolated avian strains. cell culture based production has been proposed to overcome such limitations; these processes are easier to scale-up and, through the standardization of production methods, allow for increased vaccine production. moreover, cell culture processes have the potential to reduce manufacturing time by several weeks with a faster start-up time  <cit> .

seasonal influenza vaccines derived from cell culture are gaining increased attention. in november  <dig>  the first seasonal vaccine produced in cell culture  was approved by the fda. in january  <dig>  the first trivalent influenza vaccine, flublok  made in insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus expression system, was also approved. these recent advances reflect an important trend of adopting modern cell culture manufacturing in the influenza vaccine industry. it is highly supported by public health and regulatory agencies that promote strategies to improve responses to emerging infectious diseases.

one of the most promising approaches is the use of recombinant-based virus-like particle  vaccines  <cit> . influenza vlps are non-infectious and non-replicating empty viral particles lacking viral genetic material, which display intact and biochemically active antigens on their surface. they can be composed of one, or different combinations, of the viral antigens and structural influenza proteins: ha, na, m <dig> and m <dig>  <cit> .

immunizations with influenza vlps to protect against either seasonal or pandemic influenza strains have shown promising results  <cit> . vlps have a stronger safety profile than native infectious viruses produced either in egg-based or cell-based systems. no infectious virus potentially harmful to humans is used as a seed inoculant or produced, thus production processes do not require the use of high level containment facilities. with more clinical trials underway for vlp vaccines  <cit> , there is a critical need for the scientific and engineering communities to tackle the specific challenges associated with the bioprocessing aspects of vlp production.

thus far, different production processes have been studied for influenza vlps. they vary according to the viral strain produced, the type of gene delivery system used and the host-cell expression system. influenza vlps have been produced in mammalian, insect and plant cell platforms using a variety of vectors and gene delivery techniques  <cit> . the majority of vlp productions have been done in insect cells with the baculovirus expression vector system   <cit> . however, this system suffers from contamination with baculovirus  particles  <cit>  in final vaccine preparations. this contamination has been known for a long time and can represent up to 5% of the total proteins in final purified vlp preparations  <cit>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bevs per vaccine dose  <cit> . baculovirus are non-replicative in mammalian cells, but they have been reported to trigger an innate immune response. although there is some evidence that baculovirus is safe for immunization  <cit> , in terms of process development and evaluation of the immunization efficiency from vlps alone, such high level of contaminant presents a problem. alternative methods of vlp production in mammalian cells, using either plasmid transfection or baculovirus gene transfer in mammalian cells  have thus been developed. the second problem posed by the insect cell platforms is product glycosylation, as insect cells do not allow proper sialylation of the proteins  <cit> . different groups are now working on the introduction of such glycosylation pathways in insect cell systems.

most studies thus far have focused on the proof of concept of vlp production and the evaluation of influenza vlps immunogenicity to support their candidacy as potential vaccines  <cit>  and as a model to gain insight into the requirements for influenza virus budding  <cit> . nevertheless, to date, limited attention has been paid to the specific challenges posed by the manufacturing of vlps. however, studies of this nature are starting to surface  <cit> .

in line with the theme of studying the bioprocessing of influenza vlps, this study assessed two platforms for vlp production, the insect  and mammalian  suspension and serum-free production platforms with influenza gene transfer by baculovirus infection and transduction, respectively. vlp production and contaminant levels , as well as the challenges associated to each production systems are discussed.

methods
cells and medium
the hek <dig> cell line used for vlp production was previously adapted to suspension and serum-free culture  <cit> . working cell banks were made from a vial of the master cell bank, which was developed under good manufacturing practices . hek <dig> cells used for vlp production were grown in shake flasks at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  in animal component and serum free sfm4transfx 293™  medium . insect spodoptera frugiperda  cells were maintained in serum free sf <dig> ii medium , in shake flasks at 27°c with an agitation rate set at 110 rpm. cell density was monitored using the cedex cell counter .

construct design of the gene transfer system
baculovirus bacmam for mammalian cell production system 
the recombinant baculovirus used for hek <dig> cell transduction  was previously described in tang et al.  <cit>  and kindly donated by dr. ted ross . one recombinant baculovirus was used to drive the expression of ha, na and m <dig> genes from h1n <dig> a/puerto rico/8/ <dig> influenza strain under the control of individual cmv promoter. bacmam pr <dig> also contained a green fluorescent protein  reporter gene under the cmv promoter and a vsv-g protein under polyhedron promoter control in order to improve cell transduction. a working stock of bacmam pr <dig> baculovirus was produced by generation of p <dig> bacmam pr <dig> stock in sf <dig> cells with bacmid transfection and two subsequent bacmam pr <dig> amplifications in sf <dig> cells .

baculovirus construction for insect cells production system 
for production in insect cells, co-infection with three baculoviruses each carrying influenza proteins, ha, na or m <dig> was chosen. the influenza proteins were under polyhedron promoter  control for expression in insect cells. the construction of vectors for further generation of p <dig> baculovirus stocks through sf <dig> cells transfection was performed as follows: the dna sequence of h1n <dig> a/puerto rico/8/ <dig> ha , na  and m <dig>  were obtained from ncbi’s influenza database. influenza gene sequences were inserted between xbai and bglii enzyme restrictions sites and further in a puc plasmid by biobasic . each influenza gene, flanked by xbai and bglii sites, was further inserted in the pvl <dig> plasmid, belonging to the commercial baculogold™ system  used for the construction of baculovirus allowing expression of recombinant proteins in sf <dig> cells. each of the three plasmids, respectively named pvl1393-ha, pvl1393-na and pvl1393-m <dig>  were co-transfected with baculovirus dna to produce recombinant baculoviruses referred to as bac-ha, bac-na, and bac-m <dig>  similarly, to produce the bacmam pr <dig> virus stock, each bac-ha, bac-na and bac-m were passaged twice in sf <dig> cells to produce a p <dig> working viral stock used for vlp production .

vlp production
for both cellular platforms, during the production optimization phases, cultures were sampled once to twice a day and cell density, viability and average cell diameter were measured using the cedex cell counter .

mammalian hek <dig> cell platform
for vlp production in hek <dig> cells, transduction with bacmam pr <dig> was performed at a cell density of  <dig> - <dig> × <dig> cells/ml. an moi of  <dig> was used . production runs were carried out in shake flasks with working volumes of 60–400 ml. in production runs, butyric acid was added at a final concentration of 5 mm at the time of infection. after 48 hours post-infection, culture broth samples were clarified by slow centrifugation at  <dig> × g for 5– <dig> minutes. culture supernatant samples were concentrated via sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and analysed by western blot, ha assay, negative stain transmission electron microscopy  and single radial immuno-diffusion assay .

insect sf <dig> cell platform
vlp productions in sf <dig> cells were performed in shake flasks with working volumes of 60–400 ml. cells were infected with p <dig> working stocks at a density of  <dig> - <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml with a total moi of  <dig> - <dig>  at 27°c . cells were harvested after 48 hours post-infection, when the viability started to decline below 70-50%. upon harvest, the supernatant samples were collected with slow centrifugation at  <dig> × g for 5– <dig> minutes, then concentrated via sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and analysed by western blot, ha assay, nstem and srid.

vlps extraction from cell pellet
the cell pellets obtained after slow centrifugation were re-suspended in a solution of pbs and 10 μg/ml of tpck-trypsin and slowly agitated at 37°c for 30 minutes to produce cell pellet wash. cells were pelleted via slow centrifugation and the supernatant was collected for analysis by western blot, ha assay and nstem. a cell lysis extraction was also performed after this first treatment by one freeze-thaw cycle. the cell lysis supernatant was collected by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for 5 min and then analysed using western blot, ha assay and nstem.

influenza virus production
influenza h1n <dig> a/pr/8/ <dig> virus was produced in house as described in petiot et al.  <cit>  and used as standard for the western blot, ha assay and nstem images.

vlp concentration and purification
sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation
the vlp supernatants were sublayered with 10 ml of a 25% sucrose solution prepared in 20 mm tris–hcl . the maximal vlp volume loaded was of 200 ml of culture supernatants, centrifuged at 4°c and  <dig>  <dig> × g for 3 hours . the ultracentrifugation supernatants were discarded and the vlps were collected as pellets, re-suspended in 20 mm tris–hcl, 1% sucrose and 2 mm mgcl <dig>  ultracentrifugation purified samples were stored overnight at 4°c, then aliquoted and stored either at −80°c or 4°c. this purification step allowed to concentrate vlp production samples up to 20-75×.

iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation
gradient iodixanol purification was done from two working stock solutions of iodixanol, one with 40% w/v and one with  <dig> % w/v. these solutions were prepared from optiprep iodixanol solution  with 60 mm tris–hcl . vlp concentrated solutions from the sucrose cushion purification step were combined to the  <dig> % iodixanol working stock and subjected to slow mixing to give a final iodixanol concentration of 20% and a vlp dilution of  <dig> ×. the vlp-iodixanol solution was then loaded into 13 ml ultracentrifuge tubes, sealed and centrifuged at  <dig>  <dig> × g for 6 hours at 4°c . after ultracentrifugation, 1 ml fractions were taken from the bottom of the tubes and weighed to determine the density and iodixanol concentration. each fraction was then analysed by western blot, ha assay and ntsem.

vlp quantification and detection
western blot
samples were loaded on a bio-rad mini-protean tris-glycine 4-15% gel with 1× running buffer . the gel was run for 40 minutes at 200 v and then washed with towbin transfer buffer . semi-dry protein transfer to nitrocellulose membrane was performed using a bio-rad trans-blot 3d semi-dry transfer cell  for 1 hour at 10 v. membranes were then blocked for 1 hour in 5% milk solution . the membrane was washed with  <dig> % tween tbs at ph  <dig>  and then incubated overnight at 4°c with its respective antibody . the secondary antibody incubation  lasted 1 hour at 4°c. primary antibodies used for ha, na, m <dig> and gp <dig> were as follows: anti-ha and anti-na, polyclonal sheep serum ; anti-ha monoclonal mouse ; anti-m <dig> monoclonal mouse antibody ; anti-gp <dig> monoclonal mouse antibody . the secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-sheep and donkey anti-mouse  igg hrp from jackson immunoresearch . images were acquired with a ds image station 440cf .

hemagglutination assay
the ha assay was completed in  <dig> well v-bottom plates. wells were filled with  <dig> μl of 1× pbs solution in rows a-h, columns 2– <dig>  next,  <dig>  μl of 1× pbs was loaded into wells b <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  each sample took up two rows  and was serially diluted with vlp samples from the supernatant, sucrose cushion and iodixanol purifications.  <dig> μl of vlp sample was loaded into wells  <dig> and  <dig> of rows a, c, e, and g, then  <dig>  μl into wells  <dig> and  <dig> of rows b, d, f and h. the vlp sample was then serially diluted and  <dig> ul of 5-day old chicken red blood cells at a concentration 2× <dig> cell/ml were added to each well in the plate. the plates were left in a covered plastic container for 3 hours to overnight at room temperature and scored. the amount of ha in units ha/ml was calculated with the following correlation: loghaunits100ul=logdilutionfactoratlastwellagglutinated 

single radial immunodiffusion assay
a 1% agarose gel solution was prepared and equilibrated at 50°c in a water bath. agarose gel solution was added with anti-ha sheep serum  with a final concentration of 1/ <dig>  the agarose-antibody mixture was casted and left to cool in a bio-rad gel-casting module for at least 15 minutes. in the gel, 4 mm wells were punched before addition of 20 μl of sample in each well. for all the srid experiments, a calibration curve was determined with standard samples of purified recombinant ha of a/h1n1/puerto rico/8/ <dig> strain from protein sciences corporation  at concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 30 μg/ml. all the samples were subjected to detergent treatment for 15 minutes on a rocker platform . sample diffusion in the gel took place for 18– <dig> hours at room temperature. the gel was dried using whatman # <dig> filter paper , rinsed with deionized water, and stained with coomassie blue r- <dig> for 15 minutes and de-stained using a  <dig> % acetic acid and 10% ethanol solution. result analyses were performed on gel photograph where the diameter of the reference standards and samples were measured using image-j software  allowing further calculation of sample concentration through linear correlation.

negative stain transmission electron microscopy 
nstem analysis were conducted at institut armand frappier  adapting a method previously described  <cit> . for each samples,  <dig> micrographs were counted with samples pre-diluted to have at least  <dig> vlps on the grid. the range of vlps counted was between  <dig> and  <dig> particles. the particle count was quantified using the following equation: vlp/ml =  × .

RESULTS
it is important to note that, for all the analysis performed , the samples were concentrated by a sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation step. this concentration step was necessary as the available quantification methods are not sensitive or specific enough to directly quantify total vlps and protein composition of non-purified culture supernatants. this allowed us to i) reach detectable levels and ii) and reduce the contamination by free influenza and host cell proteins in the sample. consequently, most of the assays were performed with at least a 40× concentrated sucrose cushion purified samples and all the values presented in the paper correspond to their relative normalized production levels .

vlp morphology and particle quantification
influenza virus and vlp morphology were analysed by visual inspection on nstem micrographs, and the concentration of vlp particles were assessed for the comparison of vlp production efficiency in both cellular platforms. previous studies of influenza virus production in hek <dig> cell culture described the virus as pleomorphic particles containing spikes with an average size of  <dig> +/− 20 nm  <cit> . influenza virus consisted mainly of spherical and elongated particles  <cit> . an example of h1n <dig> a/puerto rico/8/ <dig> influenza viruses produced in-house on the same hek <dig> cell platform  <cit>  is shown in figure  <dig>  on this basis, vlps were defined as particles with a fringe of spikes on their membrane, assumed to be influenza glycoproteins ha and na, with a size range of  <dig> +/− 50 nm. nstem images of vlps produced with both hek <dig> sf and sf <dig> cells are shown in figure  <dig>  pictures presented are all from purified samples, either sucrose cushion  or sucrose cushion and iodixanol purified .figure  <dig> nstem images at  <dig> × magnification of h1n <dig> a/puerto rico/8/ <dig> , h1n <dig> influenza-vlps from hek 293sf cell production  or sf <dig> cell production . vlps or influenza virus are pointed by black arrows, baculovirus and cell vesicles are pointed by white arrows. a & b - supernatant of h1n <dig> a/puerto rico/8/ <dig> influenza virus produced in hek 293sf suspension cells as in petiot et al.  <cit> . cell vesicles carrying influenza glycoproteins could be identified. c, d & e - sucrose cushion purified samples of hek 293sf cell production; large view  and zoom-in  images of nstem grid. f & g - iodixanol purified samples of hek 293sf cell production. typical shapes of vlps and vesicles identified in high density  and low density  iodixanol fractions. h & i - sucrose cushion purified samples of sf <dig> cell production. j - iodixanol purified samples fraction  <dig>  which present the highest number of vlp particles. baculovirus were co-purified with vlps in all the iodixanol fractions, even if they were more concentrated in the high density fractions.



figure 1d, e & f present zoomed-in images of vlps produced with hek <dig> cells. the vlps were similar to influenza virus particles, although their average size ranged from  <dig> to 500 nm and they displayed the typical morphology of host cell vesicles. vlps were counted to be at a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> vlps/ml.

figure 1i & j present zoomed-in images of vlps produced in sf <dig> cells. their morphology seems to be uniform and close to influenza virus, consisting of spherical particles with an average size close to 100 nm. for these samples, a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> vlps/ml was quantified for sf <dig> vlp production.

vlp composition
vlps were expected to contain ha, na and m <dig> influenza proteins. ha and na are the antigen proteins located on the particle surface and m <dig> is the matrix protein that is the structural backbone of the viral particle. m <dig> is assumed to be located on the internal surface of the membrane envelope. for both production systems, vlp samples recovered in the culture supernatant and pre-purified by sucrose cushion were examined by western blot. the presence of ha and na in sucrose cushion was confirmed for vlps produced in both the hek <dig> and sf <dig> cell platforms . surprisingly, m <dig> was present in the sf <dig> vlps but not found in hek <dig> vlp samples .figure  <dig> western blot of sucrose cushion vlp samples from hek 293sf and sf <dig> cells. a - anti-ha western blot with two different antibodies, a monoclonal abs against ha <dig>  and a polyclonal antibody against ha <dig> . b - anti-na western blot using anti-na nibsc sheep . c - anti-m <dig> western blot using monoclonal mouse antibody .



in order to confirm expression of m <dig> in hek <dig> cells, anti-m <dig> western blots of cell pellet were performed on both sf <dig> and hek <dig> cells . m <dig> protein was present in both cell pellets, albeit in higher quantities in the sf <dig> pellet than in hek <dig>  this indicated that m <dig> produced in hek <dig> cells was not correctly incorporated into the vlps. integration of m <dig> into the sf <dig> vlps could explain for the more spherical and uniform particle shape observed with this system. m <dig> has been known for a long time to play an important role in determining the shape of influenza particles, especially for the formation of filamentous or spherical types of viral particles  <cit> . the m <dig> protein affects influenza virus morphology in a number of ways; firstly though a number of its amino acid residues  <cit>  that interact with both ha and na to drive the budding process  <cit> ; and secondly, with interactions with the np protein and the vrnp complex  <cit> .

studies of bud formation and viral particle morphology from the last decade proved that m <dig> is not the sole protein playing a role in viral particle formation and their morphology. the m <dig> protein, which is an ion channel protein, contains a highly conserved tail among different viral strains that was not necessarily responsible for their specific activity, but was later related to budding efficiency and particle morphology  <cit> . besides influenza itself, host-cell heat-shock protein  <dig>  has also been described to play an important role in bud formation  <cit> . actin was also reported in different studies as potentially impacting the virus produced shape  <cit> , and a number of other cellular proteins of vero cells have been recently detected in a/wsn/ <dig> h1n <dig> influenza virions produced in this system  <cit> . it has also been shown for different insect cell production platforms tested , that the cell type has a great impact on homogeneity of the vlps produced  <cit> . consequently, the cellular platforms used for either influenza virus or vlp production, and their membrane compositions, are expected to have a great impact on the quality of vlps produced.

a careful review of previous influenza vlp studies indicated many contradictory results. most of the influenza-vlp production studies consider that m <dig> is an important factor for correct vlp budding and is integrated into most of the constructions  <cit> . chen et al. have shown that co-expression of m <dig> and ha proteins increases vlp production, rather than ha expressed alone  <cit> . but other studies have demonstrated that vlps without m <dig> can be successfully produced, such as vlps produced in hek293t cells that only contain na from both h5n <dig> and h1n <dig> strains  <cit> . finally, m <dig> was also shown to form vlps on its own in cos- <dig> and sf <dig> cells  <cit> . this observation confirms the importance of the cellular platform on the level of incorporation of m <dig> in the vlps and on particle formation, which appears to be cell line and expression system dependent.

vlp ha activity
the particles produced as vlps by both systems were also evaluated for their activity. the ha assay was performed to demonstrate the agglutination activity of sucrose cushion purified vlps and the ha protein content  was evaluated by the standard quantification method used for influenza vaccine dose release, that is the srid assay. results are presented in the comparative table  <dig>  for the hek <dig> cell production system, vlps reached ha titers of  <dig> hau/ml whereas for sf <dig> cell produced vlps, the ha activity was at  <dig> hau/ml, which is more than  <dig> times higher. as for ha protein content, results obtained for hek <dig> cells were again lower than the sf <dig> cell system, with a production level of  <dig>  μg ha/ml for hek <dig> vlp samples and  <dig>  μg ha/ml for sf <dig> vlp samples . it is interesting to note from a product qualification point of view that the ratio of total vlps counted from both systems is not correlated to the results obtained from the srid and ha assay. this is due, as discussed in a previous review of influenza-vlp quantification methods  <cit> , to the particularity of each quantification method and their intrinsic bias. it should be emphasized that the hemagglutination or srid assays, routinely used to quantify vlps in past studies, do not have the ability to make a distinction between real virus-like particles and impurities  <cit> . vesicles or baculovirus carrying ha proteins will be quantified the same way by such methods. presently, only visual direct identification will allow for a reliable assessment of the influenza-vlp particle produced from each cellular platform. that is why this work also presents elements to qualitatively assess the purity by direct visual inspection of the samples by nstem in the following section.table  <dig>

iodixanol fractions presented for both systems are the ones containing more vlp particles, i.e. fraction  <dig> for sf <dig> cells  and fraction  <dig>  for hek293sf cells. it should be noticed that for sf <dig> and hek293sf cells, sucrose cushions were concentrated respectively of  <dig> times and  <dig> times, and for iodixanol fractions of  <dig> times and  <dig> times. the values presented in this table represent the production levels .



vlp purity and recovery
zoomed-out images of sucrose cushion purified vlps for both sf <dig> cells and hek <dig> cells are presented in figure 1c & h.

vlp purity
for sf <dig> cell productions, influenza-vlps are identified by black arrows in figure 1h. however, co-produced baculoviruses are also clearly identifiable in the picture . baculoviruses counted in this nstem micrograph sample were at a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bv/ml, which corresponds to  <dig> times more than influenza-vlps.

in order to further purify influenza-vlps from baculoviruses, iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation was applied and a picture of the third fraction collected  is shown on figure 1j. baculovirus contamination is still visible and present at a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bv/ml. as a confirmation, in both sucrose cushion and further iodixanol purified samples, the presence of envelope protein gp <dig> from baculovirus was observed on western blot analysis .

several previous studies have reported the presence of baculovirus contamination in vlp samples produced either in sf <dig> or high five cell production platforms. the level of baculovirus contamination ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> pfu/ml  <cit>  as measured by plaque assays, which is significantly lower than the one found here. in the present work, a visual assessment of baculovirus present in the sample was preferred in order to show the total contamination present and to have a better correlation with visual vlp quantification. baculovirus contamination in the influenza-vlp product poses a significant problem, as these viruses share structural and biophysical similarities with influenza-vlps, thereby complicating the development of efficient and appropriate purification processes  <cit> .

as previously mentioned by tang et al., the main motivation behind producing vlps in hek <dig> cells was to avoid or reduce the baculovirus contamination  <cit> . in our case, and as expected, baculoviruses were present in much smaller amounts in hek <dig> production samples. however, another kind of contamination was visible on hek <dig> vlps images. cell or particle debris  as well as large vesicles size  carrying the characteristic influenza fringe can be seen. the presence of cell vesicles may also complicate purification steps in downstream processing, resulting in a similar contamination problem that exists with vlp production in the baculovirus-insect cell system . when purified by iodixanol gradient, cell vesicles are also co-purified with lower size influenza-vlps. nevertheless, as indicated by the picture 1-g, high-density fractions were concentrating large cell vesicles .

downstream processing and purification have now been repeatedly pointed out as a critical step and a bottleneck in the development of such new antigen design for a number of different vlps production types  <cit> . but our observations and those of others raise additional concerns: i) the correct cut-off size for particles to be qualified as vlps and ii) the immune response generated from co-produced vesicles as it is the case of contaminating baculoviruses.

vlp recovery
as we applied a concentration step by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation prior to nstem analyses, in order to detect and count enough material, it was quite difficult to evaluate the proportion of vlps recovered from each production. although ultracentrifugation is a method broadly used to purify vlps, it has the potential to be damaging for fragile particles. to our knowledge, vlp stability during this process has not yet been evaluated.

nonetheless, the most likely explanation for such a high level of debris in hek <dig> cell sucrose cushion samples , considering that cell viability was comparable in both production systems, is that some vlps or vesicles were disrupted by the ultracentrifugation step. the images of vlps produced in hek <dig> cells showed more debris than those of vlps produced in sf <dig> cells. this might be due to the fact that vlps produced by hek <dig> cells were more fragile than those produced in sf <dig> cells. this might also be related to the observations previously made on the incorporation/lack of m <dig> in vlps produced in sf <dig> and hek <dig> cells, suggesting the importance of m1’s presence for vlp stability. although m <dig> may not be essential for vlp formation, the present study suggests its importance from a bioprocessing standpoint and the associated need for stable particles able to withstand downstream processing steps.

in order to achieve higher recovery yields, especially in the case of hek <dig> cells, cell pellets from production runs were also examined. indeed, influenza-vlps could have been entrapped on cells due to the adhesion of ha proteins to sialic acid cellular receptors. additionally, hek <dig> cells were subjected to cell clumping, which could eventually inhibit influenza-vlps release from the cell membrane.

first, pellets of hek <dig> cells were washed with a solution containing trypsin to counteract cell clumping. second, cells were lysed. the cell pellet wash and lysate were analysed by an ha assay and by nstem to reveal the presence of vlps. a treatment of the cell pellet with exogenous neuraminidase was also tested, but no noticeable effect was observed on vlp release from a pre-screening with western blot . a wide range of particles with a fringe were present in the sample from the cell pellet wash with trypsin on nstem images, including very large particles up to 500 nm . a cluster of round particles approximately 100 nm in diameter could clearly be identified as influenza-vlps. vlp concentration was counted to be  <dig>  ×  <dig> vlps/ml. particles with a fringe were also present in the cell lysate at a concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> vlps/ml, and looked very similar to those presented in figure 3a. ha assay confirmed that active ha protein was released from the cell pellet wash and in the cell lysate .figure  <dig> nstem image at  <dig> × magnification of cell pellet wash upper panel and ha activity for vlp samples produced in hek293sf cells with culture supernatant, cell pellet wash and lysate lower panel.



similar analyses of sf <dig> cell pellet wash and cell lysate did not demonstrate comparable ha activity to the supernatant. this result was expected, as cell clumping did not occur during production. these results indicate that, for some cell production platforms, an extraction step prior to harvest should allow to increase the final vlp yields.

influenza particles are known to bud from the cell membrane  <cit>  and are expected to be found in the supernatant. however, other viruses, such as hiv, were reported to occasionally bud from internal multi-vesicular bodies  <cit> , even though they usually bud from the plasma membrane. this explanation may hold some merit in our case considering that i) more than one influenza protein has the potential to induce budding  <cit> , and ii) vesicles carrying ha and/or na identified as vlps may also have come from internal membranes and were released upon cell death.

comparison of cell platforms for vlps production
from a basic point of view, this comparative study suggests that the sf <dig> system is a better production platform. indeed, it is more productive than the hek <dig> system with  <dig> times more vlp particles quantified on nstem micrographs. the particle counts allow for comparison of cell specific productivity, as both mammalian and insect cell runs were performed at  <dig> - <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml over a course of 48 hours. therefore, the sf <dig> system also presents a significant advantage in terms of vlps/cell productivity. moreover, vlps produced in insect cells were more homogeneous and resembled influenza particles produced in cell culture, whereas the vlps produced in mammalian cells were heterogeneous in shape and size. these observations were also confirmed by ha protein quantification assays, which showed that the sf <dig> cell samples had approximately  <dig> times more ha activity and presented higher amounts of ha concentration  than the hek <dig> cell production system.

however, this conclusion should be nuanced by the m <dig> protein results and purity evaluation. if the hek <dig> cell system could incorporate m <dig> into the influenza-vlps, or if other matrix proteins  would have been explored, as already done previously  <cit> , the outcomes may have been different. in haynes et al.  <cit> , approximately 2× <dig> vlp/ml were produced compared to 2× <dig> pfu/ml of baculovirus. the increased amount of vlps from this system compared to the present study  could provide a better starting point when considering downstream purification of contaminates and vlp recovery for an industrial manufacturing process.

in addition to production yields and product quantification, potential safety concerns must also be considered for both production systems. regarding cell vesicles released, it is known that they perform a variety of functions in the cell’s secretory pathway  <cit> . vesicles may contain cell waste, including proteins and nucleic acids. in vaccine products, host-cell products are strongly controlled and have to be quantified and/or inactivated as indicated in regulatory agency guidelines. to our knowledge, the content of purified influenza vlps and/or their accompanying vesicles have never been thoroughly studied. baculovirus have also been proved to strongly initiate an immune response in mice and present adjuvanting effects when injected even at low levels with vlps  <cit> . these effects could either benefit and boost the vaccine efficacy or create negative synergistic effects on the target vlps immunologic response  <cit> . study of baculovirus effect on mammal’s immune system is still on-going  <cit> , and it is not presently possible to determine the safety of such contaminant in vlp products. therefore, a lot of attention should be dedicated to the separation of vlps from baculovirus contaminants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have characterized vlps using a number of established influenza assays aiming to better compare the production capabilities of two expression platforms. such work is critical to understand and identify the bioprocessing challenges that still need to be addressed to further optimize vlp production. moreover, the present study provides a baseline for vlp production values  using hek  <dig> and sf <dig> expression systems, an information critically missing in the prevailing literature. both systems were able to produce what is referred to as vlps in the literature. however, this work has raised questions on what may be needed to produce structurally sound influenza vlps, contamination issues that both systems face, and what should be defined as a virus-like particle. influenza vlp should be a particle closely resembling influenza virus particles i.e. with the same size and morphology with the exclusion of vesicles from the cellular production system. from comparing the two production systems, it was found that the sf <dig> system produced vlps at a level  <dig> times more than the hek <dig> system, however there remains the challenge of baculovirus contamination. additionally, two important points should be underlined: firstly, the incorporation of m <dig> in the vlp may have a significant influence on the integrity and size of vlps produced, although further work is needed to elucidate how m <dig> impacts vlp stability. secondly, the hek <dig> system also presents contaminating cell vesicles, visible in a wide variety of sizes in the cell supernatant.
