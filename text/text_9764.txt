BACKGROUND
spinal muscular atrophy  is an autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of  <dig> in  <dig> live births and a carrier incidence of  <dig> in 40- <dig>  <cit> . the hallmark of sma is death of spinal motor neurons and progressive muscle atrophy  <cit> . based on age of onset and clinical severity, childhood sma has been classified into types i, ii, and iii  <cit> . type i sma is the most severe, resulting in the death of the child before the age of two, while type ii and iii individuals can live on into adulthood; however, they suffer from varying degrees of muscle paralysis and atrophy.

genetic analyses of familial sma indicate that the vast majority of sma is caused by deletion or mutation of the telomeric copy of the survival motor neuron  <dig>  gene  <cit> . complete loss of this gene in all species is lethal. in humans, a highly homologous centromeric copy of the smn gene, smn <dig>  enables patient survival, but it cannot completely compensate for the loss of smn <dig>  <cit> . the encoded smn protein has been shown to play an essential role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein  complexes  <cit> . smn appears to function in snrnp biogenesis by interacting with gemins 2- <dig>  and unrip  <cit> . a correlation between snrnp assembly activity in the spinal cord of sma mice and severity of the disease has been demonstrated  <cit> . widespread pre-mrna splicing defects have also been seen in many cells and tissues in an sma mouse model, indicating that sma may be a general splicing disorder  <cit> .

reduced levels of smn in sma patients and animal models result in selective death of motor neurons, indicating that smn plays a more critical role in motor neurons. consistent with this indication, smn has been shown to localize to granules that are actively transported into neurites and growth cones  <cit> . axonal smn appears to associate with heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein r  and to be involved in the transport of β-actin mrna  <cit> . indeed, distal axons and growth cones of motor neurons from sma mice have defects in neurite outgrowth and reduced levels of β-actin mrna and protein  <cit> . zebra fish motor neurons with smn deficiency also exhibit shorter and/or abnormally branched axons  <cit> . recent studies in sma mouse models further identified pre-synaptic defects including poor arborization, intermediate filament aggregation, impaired synaptic vesicle release, and trunk denervation  <cit> . collectively, these data support a specific function for smn in motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions.

several sma mouse models have been developed in the past decade  <cit> . one severe sma mouse model  most closely mimics human type i sma in that it lacks the mouse smn gene but carries two copies of the human smn <dig> gene  <cit> . the sma pups with this genotype appear normal at birth, but at post-natal day  <dig> , they develop sma-like symptoms including reduced suckling, decreased movement, and labored breathing. the pups die by p6- <dig>  the short lifespan in this sma mouse prohibits wide use of this model for mechanistic studies or drug development for sma. thus, development of an in vitro cell-culture system from this transgenic mouse, that recapitulates motor neuron differentiation and the unique features of mature motor neurons such as extension of axons and formation of neuromuscular junctions, will enable us to study motor neuron-specific functions of smn.

embryonic stem  cells are unique cells derived from the inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocyst. these cells are pluripotent, immortal, and can be differentiated into mature cell types in response to specific cues  <cit> . generation of spinal neurons can be achieved by exposure of embryoid bodies  to retinoic acid  and sonic hedgehog  or a hedgehog agonist  <cit> . motor neurons differentiated via this protocol were found to extend axons and form synapses with target muscle when implanted in the spinal cord  <cit> , thus confirming the power of this approach in generating mature neuronal subpopulations.

in this study, we report on the effects of the differentiation of es cells derived from the severe sma mouse model into motor neurons. we developed a new protocol to improve differentiation efficiency from ~25% to ~50%. the differentiated motor neurons were characterized by immunofluorescence and western blotting of neuronal and motor neuron markers. using proteomic techniques, we determined that multiple signaling pathways are dysregulated in sma cells.

RESULTS
in vitro motor neuron differentiation is enhanced by increasing neural patterning with noggin and fibroblast growth factors
to establish a cell-culture model of sma, we initially used the control es line  to optimize in vitro conditions for differentiation of es cells into motor neurons. since hbg <dig> es cells were derived from a transgenic mouse expressing egfp under the control of motor neuron specific promoter hb <dig>  <cit> , the efficiency of differentiation can be monitored by measuring the population of gfp+ cells. initially, es cells were propagated on mouse embryonic fibroblasts and differentiated by the addition of ra and a shh agonist  using a previous published protocol  <cit> . retinoic acid caudalizes neural progenitors, while shh has a ventralizing effect, leading to differentiation into motor neurons  <cit> . we optimized concentrations of ra  and sag  and found that a combination of  <dig> μm ra and  <dig> μm sag gave the best degree of differentiation . purmorphamine, a compound that activates the hedgehog signaling pathway and directs motor neuron differentiation  <cit> , was also tested at 1- <dig>  μm concentrations in combination with  <dig> μm ra, but the differentiation rate was always less than 20%. in order to enhance the neuralization process, we primed the es cells with the bone morphogenetic protein antagonist, noggin, and with bfgf and fgf- <dig>  prior to the 5-day induction period with ra and sag . noggin is implicated in neural induction according to the default model of neurogenesis and results in the formation of anterior neural patterning, while fgf acts synergistically with noggin in inducing neural tissue formation by promoting a posterior neural identity  <cit> . priming es cells with these two signaling molecules before differentiation induction significantly increased gfp+ population from  <dig> % ±  <dig>  to 51% ±  <dig> % . the differentiated es cells extend long processes when plated on poly-ornithine/laminin/matrigel-coated dishes .

the differentiated cells were characterized by the expression of neuronal and motor neuron marker proteins. western blotting shows that a pan-neuronal marker  and two motor neuron specific markers  are expressed in differentiated es cells but not in the undifferentiated es cells . immunofluorescence staining shows that differentiated motor neurons are neurofilament, chat, and islet- <dig> positive .

proteomic analyses reveal altered protein expression in smn-deficient es cells
the sma es cells were derived from a severe sma transgenic mouse that lacks the murine smn gene but carries two copies of the human smn <dig> gene  <cit> . western blotting shows that sma es cells have a marked reduction in smn protein . the smn-interacting protein gemin <dig> was also significantly decreased . however, morphologically, sma es cells did not differ from the control es cells . under the optimized differentiation conditions, smn-deficient es cells were differentiated into motor neurons in vitro as evidenced by neurofilament, chat, and hb <dig> expression . despite a drastic difference in smn levels , control and sma es cells showed similar levels of neuronal and motor neuron marker expression after differentiation . this is consistent with immunostaining results showing that 45-50% of differentiated cells were hb9+ in both control and sma es cells.

to identify proteins that are up- or down-regulated in smn-deficient es cells, comparative two-dimensional sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analyses of control and sma es cells were performed. the differences between control and smn-depleted protein pools were analyzed using four separate control and sma es cell extracts and quantified using decyder software . a total of  <dig> spots were identified. spots that differed with a p-value less than  <dig>   and that showed an average ratio of expression greater than or less than  <dig>  were marked as points of interest . for the undifferentiated es cell samples, the  <dig> most abundant of the total  <dig> pois were picked, and for the differentiated es cell samples, the  <dig> most abundant of the total  <dig> pois were picked. the protein identities of the picked pois were determined by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. the majority of detected proteins were expressed at similar levels in control and sma es cells , but in our proteomic analyses, we were able to identify  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins in the undifferentiated samples and  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins in the differentiated samples that were significantly altered in sma es cells . most of the proteins identified as differentially expressed in sma es cells are involved in stress-responses , cell metabolism , protein turnover and ubiquitin modification , and cytoskeleton stability . consistent with our finding, ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase l <dig> is up-regulated in type i sma fibroblasts  <cit> , and tropomyosin  <dig> is up-regulated while peroxiredoxin is down-regulated in the hippocampus of smn-/-; smn2+/+ mice  <cit> . we obtained antibodies to six of the differentially expressed proteins to validate the proteomic results. western blot analysis confirmed that expression of peroxiredoxin  <dig> is increased in undifferentiated sma cells and that lactate dehydrogenase and tropomyosin  <dig> are increased in differentiated sma es cells . however, no significant changes in levels of heat shock proteins 70/ <dig> or tubulin were detected by western blotting . western blotting showed that expression of lactate dehydrogenase was increased in both undifferentiated and differentiated sma es cells, indicating increased metabolic activity in smn-deficient cells.

western blot analysis reveals specific cell stress-response pathways activated in smn-deficient es cells
our proteomic study indicates that reduced levels of smn increase expression of stress-response proteins . specific stress-response pathways dysregulated in smn-deficient es cells were analyzed by western blotting. we first analyzed levels of the stress-activated protein kinase/jun-amino-terminal kinase sapk/jnk and p <dig> map kinase in smn-deficient es cells. jnk and p <dig> map kinase are the two major stress-response pathways that are activated by a variety of cellular stresses including uv light and growth factors  <cit> . levels of phosphorylated p <dig> were elevated in sma es cells . levels of phosphorylated jnk were also increased in both undifferentiated  and differentiated  sma es cells when compared to control es cells. up-regulation of phosphorylated jnk was previously seen in primary muscle cultures derived from sma patients, although total levels of this protein were reduced in these cells  <cit> . another cell stress-response protein that is often found in stress granules where smn is seen to localize  <cit> , tia- <dig>  was also up-regulated in sma es cells . activated in response to fas ligand stimulation, tia- <dig> appears to function as a mediator of apoptotic cell death  <cit> . protein disulfide isomerase was down-regulated in sma es cells, but the vast majority of chaperones and er stress-related proteins were not changed . levels of p <dig>  bax, bad, and puma were also not affected in sma es cells .

cellular stress-response protein p <dig> is up-regulated in both smn-deficient es cells and in spinal cords of sma transgenic mice
the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> waf1/cip <dig> acts as an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression. it has been shown that p <dig> is induced in response to a variety of stress signals, including genotoxins, oxidants, and metabolic perturbation  <cit> . western blot analyses show that levels of p <dig> are increased in both undifferentiated and differentiated sma es cells . in differentiated control cells, p <dig> is expressed at very low levels but is increased by as much as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold  in differentiated sma cells. by contrast, the expression of another member of the cip/kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p <dig>  was unaffected . p <dig> is also up-regulated in spinal tissue obtained from sma transgenic mice compared to spinal tissue from control mice .

discussion
in this study, we have developed an improved protocol for in vitro motor neuron differentiation using gfp expression as a readout in the control es line   <cit> . this protocol employs a multi-step process that involves priming es cells with noggin and fgfs prior to addition of signaling molecules ra and sag . using this modified procedure, we were able to generate a motor neuron population in vitro with high efficiency . the differentiated es cells acquired immunohistochemical features of motor neurons as evidenced by expression of neuronal and motor neuron markers . we also derived es cells from a severe transgenic sma mouse for differentiation to provide a cell-culture model for type i sma. applying this method to sma es cells, we were able to perform proteomic analyses to identify pathways affected in both undifferentiated and differentiated sma es cells.

differentiation efficiency of control and sma es cells were similar, but our study shows that several pathways involved in cell stress-response, energy metabolism, protein turnover, and cytoskeleton stability are affected by low expression of smn . interestingly, similar disturbances in these pathways have been reported in other proteomic studies using different proteomic approaches that were conducted in smn-deficient cells and tissues other than motor neurons  <cit> .

although motor neurons are the primary cells affected in sma, most studies use alternative tissues or cell cultures because of difficulties in obtaining motor neurons from affected animals. antibodies detect proteins with higher specificity and sensitivity, but such studies are restricted by availability of suitable antibodies for blotting or antibody arrays. by comparison, comparative two-dimensional sds-page difference gel electrophoresis and itraq analyses can be used to provide unbiased analysis of protein changes. for itraq expression, differences are determined from alterations in quantities of the tags used to label discrete populations of peptides derived from proteins isolated from control and affected cells or tissues. this requires all peptides to be identified by lc/ms/ms. for gel systems, differences in quantities of dye-tagged proteins are determined, and only differentially expressed proteins need to be processed for identification by ms/ms. we detected  <dig> spots using two-dimensional sds-page compared to an itraq study with sma fibroblasts that detected  <dig> proteins  <cit> . in both techniques, quantification of less-abundant proteins is less accurate. among dysregulated proteins that are involved in cellular metabolism, we confirmed up-regulation of lactate dehydrogenase in sma es cells by western blotting . lactate dehydrogenase is an oxidoreductase of the glycolysis pathway that catalyses the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of nadh and nad+  <cit> . aberrant expression of lactate dehydrogenase and other energy metabolism enzymes  in sma cells could disturb energy production and consumption, and contribute to the pathology of sma. consistent with our findings, mrnas encoding several enzymes of glycolysis are aberrantly expressed in muscles derived from sma patients  <cit> .

in our proteomic analyses, we also found up-regulation of tropomyosin in differentiated sma es cells . a similar finding was reported in the hippocampus of smn-/-; smn2+/+ mice  <cit> . tropomyosin is a dimeric coiled-coil protein that binds along the length of actin filaments. in non-muscle cells, tropomyosin stabilizes cytoskeleton actin filaments  <cit> . thus, dysregulation of tropomyosin could compromise actin dynamics and cytoskeleton stability. levels of other actin binding proteins have been proposed to play a role in sma. profilin ii, the small actin-binding protein that associates with smn  <cit> , is up-regulated in both smn-depleted pc <dig> cells and cells from an sma mouse model  <cit> . the actin bundling protein plastin  <dig> has recently been identified as a protective, gender-specific modifier of sma and is associated with smn and actin in a large protein complex  <cit> . together, these findings implicate a role for disruption of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in sma pathogenesis.

up-regulation of peroxiredoxin  <dig> in sma es cells , and increased expression of peroxiredoxin protein in sma mouse tissue  <cit> , implicates cell stress-responses in sma. peroxiredoxin  <dig> is an antioxidant enzyme that reduces levels of h2o <dig> to protect cells from oxidative injury  <cit> . up-regulation of peroxiredoxin  <dig> could be a compensatory response to potentially increased oxidative stress in smn-deficient cells. reduced levels of smn have been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit> , which can initiate oxidative stress. expression of peroxiredoxin  <dig> is also increased in a mutant sod <dig> mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> . interestingly, over-expression of smn protects cells against cell death induced by mutant sod <dig> under oxidative stress  <cit> . to investigate the notion that smn deficiency might lead cells in stress in more detail, we used western blotting to show that activation of the p <dig> map kinase and jnk pathways were increased in both undifferentiated and differentiated sma es cells . both of these pathways have been implicated in neuronal cell death by activating apoptotic pathways in response to heat and osmotic shock, genotoxic damage, x-ray and uv radiation, and proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . we also showed that the stress-response protein tia- <dig> is increased in sma es cells . tia- <dig> is often localized in stress granules where smn is seen to locate  <cit> . notably, expression of the stress-response protein p <dig> is increased significantly in both sma es cells and spinal cord tissues of a mouse model of sma . we could not determine whether disease progression affects p <dig> expression because we were unable to recover sufficient spinal cord samples from different aged sma mice. although p <dig> expression is higher in undifferentiated sma cells than in undifferentiated control cells, the differences are much more striking in the differentiated cells. up-regulation of p <dig> is a cellular response to stress that leads to cell growth arrest and favors cell survival  <cit> , but prolonged stress in sma cells will eventually lead to cell death. transcription factors such as p <dig>  sp <dig>  p <dig>  cebpβ, and stats induce expression of the p <dig> gene  <cit> . however, as p <dig> levels are not altered in smn-deficient cells , it is unlikely that up-regulation of p <dig> is mediated by this transcription factor in smn-deficient cells. thus, the mechanism by which smn deficiency leads to up-regulation of p <dig> is not yet clear.

our analyses show a number of pathways that are dysregulated in sma es cells but the most important may be induction of cell stress. this cell stress might explain why we see significantly reduced numbers of sma es cells compared to control es cells  <dig> days after differentiation  and why motor neurons are particularly sensitive to smn deficiency in sma patients. stress-induced cell death is more pronounced in fibroblasts derived from sma patients compared to age-matched controls  <cit> , and regulation of smn expression directly influences cell survival  <cit> . modulation of levels of down-stream effectors of cell death such as pro-apoptotic bax and the antiapoptotic factor bcl-xl in sma mice directly impacts the disease phenotype and lifespan of sma mice  <cit> . all these studies support the hypothesis that smn plays an active role in cell survival. the recent groundbreaking discovery that human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into an es cell-like state has significantly advanced the field of stem cell and neurodegenerative disease research. therefore, it will be of great interest to determine if the similar pathways are aberrantly regulated in the induced pluripotent stem cells derived from sma fibroblasts.

CONCLUSIONS
we have derived smn-deficient es cells from a severe transgenic sma mouse which represent a cell-culture model of sma. our work indicates that lower expression of smn activates cellular stress pathways and causes a dysregulation of energy metabolism, protein degradation, and cytoskeleton stability.
