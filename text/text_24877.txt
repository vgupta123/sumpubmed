BACKGROUND
light is the ultimate source of energy for plant growth. during the light reaction of photosynthesis, light energy is used to drive the electron flow from water to napd+, and during this process, a proton gradient is established across the thylakoid membrane for atp formation. photosynthesis thus provides energy  and reducing power to plants, which exert great impacts on plant physiology. information on the effects of light on the leaf transcriptome of arabidopsis has been reported in previous studies. however these studies either employed homemade microarray with less than  <dig>  probes  <cit>  or affymetrix ath <dig>  <cit>  or aligent oligo microarrays  <cit> . the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray only contains  <dig>  genes and the probe does not represent all the genes in the arabidopsis nuclear genome  and no transcripts from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes were detected in the aligent microarray  <cit> . in plants, many biological processes are correlated with photosynthesis. since chloroplasts and mitochondria are the two key power houses of plant cells and many components of the energy generating systems  are encoded by both nuclear and organelle genomes, transcription data of organelle genomes are required to depict a clear picture on plant energy biology. in this report, whole genome transcriptomic data, including transcripts transcribed from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, was obtained by rna sequencing. given that changes in transcript abundances are not always coherence with changes in protein levels  <cit> , the changes in leaf proteomes were also examined  <cit> . in addition, the changes in key leaf metabolites of arabidopsis thaliana, including atp, adp, nadp+, nadph, after the onset of illumination were also investigated. metabolomics is now becoming an essential component of such post-genomic studies. as the measurements of changes in mrna and protein levels cannot always directly reflect the changes in plant physiology, metabolomics provide a clear picture on plant’s energy and nutritional status  <cit> . the integration of these omics data is expected to give us a better understanding on the impacts of light on the physiology of plant leaves  <cit> .

RESULTS
rna-seq and differential analyses
for each sample, nearly 65 m reads of  <dig> bases and  <dig> gbp length sequences were obtained from deep sequencing. total sequenced reads were mapped to both arabidopsis tair  <dig>  genes and genome respectively . reads were sorted into two subgroups: single designated reads that mapped only once to the gene/genome location; and multiple reads mapped many times to more than one location in the gene/the genome. approximately 75 % reads could be mapped to arabidopsis genes. around 60 % of reads were aligned to only one position whilst 15 % of reads were mapped to two or more positions . however, when the reads were mapped to the arabidopsis genome, approximately 85 % were aligned in each library. 80 % were mapped to only one position and 4 % were mapped to more than one position in the genome . in total  <dig>  expressed transcripts were detected in the rna-sequencing data, which included  <dig>  transcripts encoded by the nuclear genome,  <dig> transcripts encoded by the mitochondrial genome and  <dig> transcripts encoded by the chloroplast genome . the genes encoded by sequenced rnas were classified by their functional classes and compared with those annotated in tair  <dig>   . table  <dig> shows that in total transcripts of  <dig>  nuclear genes were detected, of which  <dig>  genes were sorted to protein coding class. the numbers are fewer than the number of transcripts detected  because some genes expressed more than one splice variants. only  <dig> pre-trnas were found in our samples most likely because most trnas are shorter than 90 bp.table  <dig> total number of sequencing reads mapped to genes in tair  <dig> 


a numbers in denominator are the total gene number of each type of rnas annotated in tair  <dig>  database 



in order to distinguish the homologous transcripts derived from the nucleus and from the organelles, clean reads were mapped to the arabidopsis col- <dig> mitochondrion-encoded gene set and the chloroplast-encoded gene set, respectively. the results showed that  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts encoded by chloroplasts and mitochondria were detected, respectively . the average rpkm for mapped nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial genes are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. it is important to note that each leaf cell contains only one nuclear genome but contains approximately  <dig> chloroplasts, hundreds of mitochondria and each chloroplast and mitochondrion contain a few genomes. this explains the high rpkm of transcripts encoded by both organellar genomes.

more transcripts were significantly changed at t <dig> than at t <dig> . the differentially expressed genes  at t <dig> and t <dig> represented those genes that are immediately responded to illumination, whereas the degs between t <dig> and t <dig> represented the genes that were indirectly affected by illumination, possibly due to metabolic changes . most of the differentially expressed genes  were nuclear-encoded or encoded by the mitochondrial genome but none was encoded by the chloroplast genome .fig.  <dig> 
a differentially expressed genes were shown in different groups. fdr ≤  <dig> , p <  <dig>  and  <dig> fc. b differentially expressed proteins in different groups. fdr <  <dig> , p <  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  fc were presented



alternative splicing  is another area where rna-sequencing data can provide new information. generally, there are seven frequent types of as namely exon skipping , intron retention , alternative 5’ splicing site , alternative 3’ splicing site , alternative first exon , alternative last exon  and mutually exclusive exon   <cit> . to date,  <dig>  protein-coding genes in the tair  <dig> database have been documented to exhibit alternative splicing . this phenomena has been documented to be affected by time of day  <cit> , environmental conditions  <cit> , and stresses  <cit> . our data showed that the most abundant alternative splicing sites were distributed in the type of intron retention and alternative 3’ splicing . novel transcripts were also discovered from our samples . more novel transcripts were detected at time point t <dig> than were detected at the other time points, however, whether these putative novel transcripts are genuine transcripts remains to be validated in future studies.

some photosystem transcripts, including pql <dig>  pql <dig>  ferredoxin <dig>  cyt c6a, fdc <dig>  lhca <dig>  lhcb <dig>  and lhcb <dig>  were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr  using the same total rna from deep sequencing. the mrna abundance of selected genes at t <dig> was adjusted to  <dig>  the ratios of transcript abundance of t1: t <dig> and t8: t <dig> were statistically analyzed. the results revealed that all the selected transcripts were consistent between rna-sequencing and qrt-pcr .

proteomics studies
after strong cation-exchange  run, fractions were collected at every minute and finally  <dig> fractions were combined into  <dig> fractions for lc/ms/ms analysis. the profiles of scx separation fractions are presented in additional file  <dig>  spectra, peptide and protein identification were performed using proteinpilot software. results of identified proteins, peptides and spectra with different false discovery rate  thresholds are presented in additional file 9a. in total,  <dig>  proteins,  <dig>  peptides and  <dig>  spectra were identified with 95 % confidence in local fdr.  <dig>  proteins,  <dig>  peptides and  <dig>  spectra were identified with 99 % global fdr.  <dig>  % confidence happened at local fdr and  <dig>  % confidence in global fdr from fit with threshold of 1 % at protein level .  <dig>  total proteins with  <dig> or more peptides were identified . the number of differentially expressed proteins in different groups were statistically analyzed  and shown in fig. 1b. western blotting were carried out to validate the results of proteomics .

effects of light on the transcription and translation of chloroplast genome
out of  <dig> chloroplast protein coding genes ,  <dig> cds were detected in our rna-seq data . since arabidopsis chromosome genome contains two inverted repeats , the reads mapped to these regions were counted twice. by contrast, proteinpilot only assigned unused peptides to proteins and each peptide is only assigned to one protein. for the repeat, we have to manually copy the proteomics data obtained for one repeat to the other. the transcription levels of most genes were not significantly affected by light  cut off, p <  <dig> ). nonetheless, significant changes could be observed in the respective protein profiles. out of the  <dig> chloroplast proteins detected in isobartic tags for relative and absolute quantitation  experiment, the abundances of only one protein  and three proteins  were up- or down-regulated at t1: t <dig>  respectively, whereas the abundances of eight and seven proteins were up-regulated and down-regulated at t8: t <dig>  respectively. all eight up-regulated proteins are ribosomal proteins . by contrast, five of the seven down-regulated proteins  at t <dig> are core proteins of photosystem i  and photosystem ii . no correlation between transcriptome and proteome could be observed.

effects of light on the transcription and translation of mitochondrial genome
among the  <dig> mitochondria cds in the arabidopsis database ,  <dig> mitochondria cds transcripts and  <dig> proteins were detected in the rna-sequencing and itraq data, respectively. in contrast to the plastid transcripts, the abundance of many mitochondrial transcripts showed significant increase or decrease upon illumination, of which almost all of them encode proteins of uncharacterized functions. by contrast, the abundances of very few proteins were affected by illumination .

counterpart homologs of  <dig> mitochondria-encoded genes are also found in a single syntenic block in nuclear chromosome  <dig>  with several minor inversions. strikingly, the orthologous gene pairs between the intercompartmental collinear blocks are extremely similar with most of them being exactly the same with 100 % amino acid identity. for these homologous genes, caution must be taken when gene expression  and protein abundance levels are interpreted.

effects of illumination on the transcription and translation of photosystems
comparing to the transcript levels in dark, most genes involved in photosynthesis were significantly up-regulated upon illumination . while mrna transcriptions of photosystems i and ii components encoded by the chloroplast genome were not significantly changed, the transcription of psi and psii components encoded by the nuclear genome were significantly up-regulated. this was also true for lhc  and lhcii  genes, which are encoded by the nuclear genome. by contrast, the transcriptions of ndh complexes and cyt b6f complexes as well as lhca <dig> and lhca <dig> were not significantly altered. the transcription of some soluble electron carriers, including pete <dig>  fd <dig>  cyt c6a and fnr <dig> also changed significantly. for some genes, the increase in transcript abundance happened within an hour , but for most genes longer time  was required . regarding protein abundance, while the levels of rubisco large subunit  and atp synthase subunit  remained constant , the abundances of some electron transport proteins , components of oxygen-evolving complex   and atp synthase subunits c <dig> and e were down-regulated at t1: t <dig>  furthermore following prolonged illumination , the protein abundance of some components of photosystem i , photosystem ii , oec  were down-regulated .fig.  <dig> heatmap of transcription and translation profiles of chloroplast photosystems at different time points. each value was calculated by log <dig> ratio and colors were scaled per row with up-regulated in red and down-regulated in green. missing data were represented by grey boxes. heatmap was generated from http://bbc.botany.utoronto.ca/ntools/cgi-bin/ntools_heatmapper_plus.cgi. ratios of  are compared between each two time points



in summary, while many transcripts were significantly up-regulated upon illumination, protein abundances did not increase in most cases, suggesting that other factors, such as translational control and protein turnover may also affect protein abundance.

effects of illumination on transcription and translation of redox proteins and enzymes of the central carbon metabolism
upon illumination of c <dig> plants, atp and nadph are generated from the photosystem. utilizing the atp and nadph, co <dig> is fixed to three-carbon compounds through the calvin–benson–bassham  cycle. these c <dig> compounds are used to synthesize starch in the plastid or exported to the cytosol for sucrose synthesis or atp generation through glycolysis, tca cycle and respiration in mitochondria. the changes in transcript and protein abundances of the above pathways upon illumination are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  surplus electrons from lef can be passed to fd-dependent enzymes for nitrogen and sulfur assimilation, or to thioredoxin  and nadph . a few proteins of the cbb cycle were found to be significantly reduced at t <dig> and t <dig> . metabolite profiling verified that the amount of sucrose was significantly increased at t <dig> but not at t <dig> . the amount of sps protein , the rate-limiting enzyme of sucrose synthesis, increased at t <dig> and t <dig>  without substantial changes in mrna transcription . for enzymes in glycolysis  and tca cycle , the protein abundance of most enzymes did not show significantly changes. regarding the enzymes in respiratory chains, their mrna transcripts were mostly unaffected by illumination. the changes in transcript and protein abundances of redox proteins upon illumination are shown in additional file  <dig>  for protein abundance, only a few components of complex iii  increased significantly at t <dig>  whereas only one component of complex i  and one component of complex ii  decreased significantly at t <dig> .table  <dig> metabolomic data of 20-d-old wt arabidopsis leaves at t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> after illumination

data are normalized to the mean response calculated for the time point  of each measured batch. values are presented as the mean ± se of  <dig> biological determinations. asterisks at t <dig> and t <dig> indicate values significantly different from t <dig>  as calculated by t test  with p-value <  <dig> 



metabolomic and pathway activity analyses
the levels of atp, adp, nadp+ and nadph in leaves of 20-d-old arabidopsis plants harvested at different time points of illumination were measured. compared to the level measured at t <dig>  the atp content in leaf was significantly higher at t <dig> but its level dropped slightly after 8 h illumination . the same trend occurred in adp levels during dark to light transition. as the levels of both atp and adp change in similar extends, the ratio of atp/adp was invariant at all three time points. for nadph, the levels were more than two folds during illumination  compared with that at the end of night . since a large amount of nadph is produced by linear electron flow  under light condition, it is reasonable that the levels of the metabolites were higher under illumination. as nadph displayed greater than two fold increase while atp only had slight increase upon illumination, the atp/nadph ratio dropped significantly under illumination. by contrast, the nadph/nadp+ ratios were indifferent between the three time points.fig.  <dig> metabolites were measured from 20-d-old arabidopsis leaves of wt at t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  a atp, b adp, c atp/adp, d nadph, e nadp+, f nadph/nadp+, g atp/nadph, h adp + atp and i nadp++nadph were presented respectively. data were expressed as means with ± sd of three biological replicates. statistical differences  in the same column for each line were based on one-way anova analysis followed by tukey’s honestly significant differences  test using statistical program ibm spss  <dig>  within each column, the values marked by different letters  are significantly different . the data were reproducible in at least  <dig> independent experiments. fw: fresh weight



metabolites measured using a gc-ms platform, including amino acids, organic acids sugars and others are shown in table  <dig>  while the levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose significantly increased at t <dig>  the levels of glucose and fructose significantly decreased at t <dig>  regarding tca metabolites, the levels of malate and fumarate increased significantly but the level of succinate decreased significantly at t <dig> 

pathway activities were calculated based on the metabolome data , using the pathway activity profiling  algorithm. in total for  <dig> pathways significantly different activity levels were discovered in pairwise comparisons  between any two of the three time points . at t <dig>  the activities of starch and sucrose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, valine, leucine and isoleucine synthesis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were significantly higher than t <dig>  but that of purine, pyrimidine alanine, aspartate, glutamate and lysine metabolisms were significantly lower . notably, the pathway activities of major carbon metabolism, including starch and sucrose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, galactose, fructose, mannose metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were significantly lower after prolonged illumination . interestingly, the pathway activity of the glycerolipid metabolism was significantly increased by time in all three comparisons . a similar trend was observed for the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis .fig.  <dig> calculation of pathway activity based on metabolomic data analysis. a the table shows pathways that significantly differentially activity levels were discovered in pairwise comparisons  between any two of the three time points . b heatmap for significantly different pathway activities. red represents higher pathway activity while green stands for a less active. pathway names were marked with three columns of signs, illustrating the significant level of the three pathway-based pairwise comparisons. from left to right, three signs represent the t1:t <dig>  t8:t <dig> and t8:t <dig> comparisons, respectively. ‘+’ stands for significantly more active , ‘-’ stands for significantly less active , and ‘=’ is for statistically insignificant comparisons. the significance cut-off was set to p-value <  <dig> 



integration of transcriptome and proteome analyses with metabolome-based pathway activity data
differentially expressed genes were mapped to > <dig> pathways in kegg database for arabidopsis thaliana. we calculated the numbers of all up- or down-regulated genes for all pathways in the three pairwise comparisons between any two of the three time points . the average ratio of significance denoted as the number of significant genes divided by the total number of genes in the pathway was ~16 %. photosynthesis - antenna proteins, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis and brassinosteroid biosynthesis were the metabolic pathways with the highest number of genes found to significantly alter their expression levels . we hypothesized that the pathway activity should in general be higher when there are more up- than down-regulated genes, and this information, theoretically, should to some degree be correlated with the metabolome-based pathway activities. as shown in fig.  <dig>  there are several pathways in which this correlation could be observed. in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis the metabolome-based pathway activity was significantly increased in all pairwise comparisons. all the genes that were found significantly differentially expressed were up-regulated . a similar trend was observed in the beta-alanine  and pyrimidine metabolism . there were also cases that a correlation between metabolome and rna data could still be observed even though both up- and down-regulated genes were retrieved from the pairwise comparisons. for the pathways valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation , pyrimidine metabolism  and glycerolipid metabolism , a higher ratio of up- or down-regulated genes in the pathway resulted to an increased or decreased, respectively, metabolome-based pathway activity . what was also interesting is that for all the aforementioned pathways the central dogma of biology was observed: the ratio of proteins with increased or decreased abundance was correlated to the ratio of up- or down-regulated genes, respectively, and of course further correlated with the metabolome-based pathway activities .fig.  <dig> the cases where similar trends in the correlations between metabolome-based pathway activity and rna or protein level were observed. three pairwise comparisons based on the time points t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> were included, for rna and protein levels respectively. the radius represents the volume  of the target pathway. inner circle represents the metabolome-based pathway activity; gray: no significant difference in pathway activities; red: significantly more active; green: significantly less active. the intermediate ring stands for ratio of up- or down-regulated genes or proteins from the transcriptome or proteome comparison; gray: genes or proteins not significantly differentially expressed; red: up-regulated genes or proteins; green: down-regulated genes or proteins. the outer thin ring stands for the relationship between metabolome-based pathway activity and predicted rna or protein level pathway activity; red: positive correlation, green: negative correlation



in contrast, there were also pathways showing a negative correlation between metabolome-based activities and ratios of up- and down-regulated genes/proteins ; the c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism , fructose and mannose metabolism , glycerolipid metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis  and pentose phosphate pathway  are such pathways where the changes in the gene expression are depicted in the protein abundance but are reversed in the metabolic activities of these pathways. other notable pathways where the hypothesis of a correlation between the direction  of the majority of the significantly altered genes in a pathway and the metabolome-based pathway activity did not stand true were the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and lysine degradation . all the genes that were found significantly differentially expressed in the t1:t <dig> comparison of alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and lysine degradation were up-regulated; nevertheless the metabolome-based pathway activity was decreased. however, in both pathways a correlation between protein abundance and metabolome-based pathway activity was observed; the level of the proteins found differentially expressed in the two pathways were lower in the t <dig> compared to t <dig>  the t8:t <dig> comparison of the carbon fixation pathway was another case were the metabolome-based activity  was positive correlated with the proteome  but not the transcriptome data .

discussion
chloroplasts and mitochondria orchestrate to generate energy for various biochemical reactions  <cit> . chloroplasts produce reducing power, atp and triose phosphates and mitochondria consume reducing power and carbohydrates produced by chloroplasts to generate atp  <cit> . the mitochondrial respiratory chain also plays an important role in maintaining the redox balance in plant cells  <cit> . while photosynthetic oxygen evolution, which generally reflects the combined activities of chloroplasts and mitochondria, responds to illumination within a minute  <cit> , the transcriptional and translational responses induced by illumination usually take longer time. the energy-generating electron-transfer chains in chloroplasts  and mitochondria  are both encoded by the nuclear genome and the organellar genomes  <cit> . hence, transcription activities of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes are also critical for investigating plant energy metabolic changes during dark to illumination conversion. rna-seq by sequencing total rna without ribosomal rnas allowed us to obtain information on transcripts encoded by the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. our method thus depicts a more complete picture of the changes in abundances of rna transcripts encoding the photosystem  and respiratory complexes . this study also identified  <dig>  proteins  encoded by both nuclear and organellar genomes and examine the changes in their abundance upon illumination.

photosynthesis is the ultimate source of energy for plants. in this study, we followed the changes in metabolites, mrna levels and protein abundance of the leaves of arabidopsis after illumination. comparing t <dig> to t <dig>  rna-seq data  revealed that the transcription of the genes of all lhci , lhcii , oec complexes , were up-regulated . this is also true for the psi and psii components encoded by the nuclear genome. when comparing t <dig> to t <dig>  only the transcription of some genes of lhci , lhcii , psad1/d <dig>  psaf were up-regulated . by contrast, the transcription of genes encoding cytochrome b6f and atp synthase , were not significantly changed. the above rna-sequencing data suggest that the transcriptions of genes encoding different functional complexes in the photosystem are differentially regulated but members of the same complex are co-regulated with each other. while the transcription of the genes described above were significantly up-regulated at t <dig> and t <dig>  their protein abundances did not alter significantly. by contrast, the protein abundance of psae1/e <dig>  psbo, psbp, cyt f, pete <dig> and fnr <dig> were down-regulated at t <dig>  whereas psaa/b and psae1/e <dig> of psi, psba, psbc, psbd of psii, psbo and psbp of oec and pete <dig> were down-regulated at t <dig>  two proteins had abundance decreased at t <dig>  but increased at t <dig>  namely cytochrome f and psal, the docking site of lhcii on psi. it should be noted that both psaa and psab  <cit> , and psbc and psbd  <cit>  are transcribed as di-cistronic transcripts. while their rna levels were steady across the three time points, their co-downregulation in protein abundance implies that the translational efficiency of the dicistronic transcripts might be compromised upon prolonged illumination.

proteomics studies of dark-grown etiolated rice seedlings revealed that the protein abundances of major photosystem proteins increased significantly upon 2-3 h illumination  <cit> . this is physiologically relevant during the greening process of plastids. by contrast, our proteomics data showed that protein abundance of some photosystem proteins in mature arabidopsis leaves decreased following 8-h of illumination. why the protein abundances of the core proteins of psi , psii  and oec  decreased at t8? the purpose might be to reduce the harvest of light energy and the overproduction of electrons after prolonged illumination, which may cause damage to the photosystem. arabidopsis chloroplasts contain at least six deg proteases  <cit> , of which deg <dig> was reported to degrade photosystem core proteins d1/d <dig>   <cit> . these data indicate that the protein abundances of photosystem components are likely to be subject to complex and versatile regulation.

the psi and psii protein components are encoded by both nuclear and plastid genomes. our rna-sequencing data showed that while the transcription of the nuclear genes was up-regulated at t <dig>  the transcription of the genes encoded by the plastid genome did not change significantly . the transcription of chloroplast genome is carried out by pep  and nep . pep is involved in the transcription of trnas and a number of photosynthesis genes  under the control of six nuclear-encoded sigma factors  <cit> . nep is involved in the transcription of a number of housekeeping genes  under the control of different nep promoters  <cit> . nonetheless, the transcription of some chloroplast genes  are controlled by both pep and nep  <cit> . in the transcription data of chloroplast genome , the transcript abundance did not change much after 1 h of illumination. only the transcription of a trna  was increased by  <dig> x. after 8 h of illumination, the transcript abundances of trns. <dig>  two psb genes  and a few ribosomal proteins  were significantly increased, and that of rrn <dig> and rrn <dig> were significantly decreased. the transcription of the two psb genes and trns. <dig> were controlled by sig <dig> and sig <dig>  respectively, and the transcription of ribosomal rna  operon are transcribed by both pep and nep  <cit> . hence, illumination affects the transcription of these chloroplast genes through both pep and nep and the regulation is complex. mitochondrial transcription is carried out by nuclear-encoded rna polymerase of the t3/ <dig> phage  and there are  <dig> rpot targeted to mitochondria  in eudicots  <cit> . rpotm was proposed to be the basic rpot for the transcription of most mitochondrial genes and rpotmp plays a specific role in the transcription of cox <dig>  ccmc, matr, nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> and rps <dig>  <cit> . upon illumination, the transcript abundance of  <dig> and  <dig> mitochondrial transcripts were enhanced  at t =  <dig> and t =  <dig>  respectively. most of them  encode for uncharacterized proteins, except for matr  and rpl <dig>  rpl <dig> and ccb <dig>  transcripts. hence, illumination also affect the transcription of these mitochondrial genes through rpot and rpotmp and the regulation is complex.

while the transcription of most chloroplast genes is steady upon illumination, the protein abundance of eight and seven proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome were significantly up- or down-regulated  . this implies that the abundance of these proteins could be regulated by differential translational regulation or protein degradation  <cit> . this was also reported for proteins translated by the mitoribosomes  <cit> .

photosynthesis is the ultimate source of reducing power and energy to plants. during photosynthesis, electrons are extracted from water molecules and passed to ferredoxin  via lef. reduced fd could then pass the electrons to nadph by  or thioredoxin  and to reduce sulfite and nitrite by ferredoxin-nitrite-reductase and sulfite reductase, respectively. all these reducing power-consuming processes are driven by light. this explains why under illumination the levels of nadph significantly increased at both t <dig> and t <dig> . while photosynthesis also generates atp, the level of atp only slightly increased at t <dig> but insignificant at t <dig> . three atp molecules and two nadph molecules are required to fix one co <dig> molecule in the cbb cycle. the lef generates atp and nadph at a ratio of  <dig> , and the shortfall in atp has to be fulfilled by other mechanisms such as cyclic electron flow  <cit>  or from mitochondria  <cit> . alternatively, excess reducing power generated from the lef has to be exported to cytosol and consumed by mitochondria to produce atp. the more significant increase in nadph content but to a much lesser extent in atp content in leaves upon illumination  reflects that the demand of atp for anabolic processes  is very high during photosynthesis and that the reducing power generated from the photosystems is more than adequate. excess reducing power from photosynthesis can be exported from the chloroplasts by the malate valve, and eventually converted into nadh for atp production at the mitochondria  <cit> . malate content in leaves increased 2-fold under prolonged illumination , perhaps reflecting its role as a substrate of the mitochondrial respiratory chain for atp production  <cit> . flux-balanced analysis predicted that mitochondrial and chloroplast atp synthases contribute  <dig> and 82 % of atp synthesis when the light intensity was between  <dig> to 280 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig> in c <dig> plants  <cit> . whether the atp produced by chloroplast atp synthase is adequate for carbon fixation is an interesting question. oligomycin treatment of barley protoplasts significantly reduced the atp levels in mitochondria and cytosol, but not the atp level in chloroplasts, indicating the importance of mitochondria in supplying atp to cytosol  <cit> .

the carbon fixed by photosynthesis is exported to the cytosol as dihydroxyacetone phosphate . dhap can serve two major purposes, anabolism  or the generation of atp through the glycolysis , the tca cycle  and mitochondria respiration . the tca cycle operates in cyclic mode in dark  when tca is the major source of atp and in non-cyclic mode  under illumination  <cit> . short-term  13co <dig> labeling of arabidopsis rosette leaves showed that fixed carbon is rapidly incorporated into cbb intermediates and adp-glu , followed by metabolites for sucrose synthesis and photorespiration, but very slowly or even negligibly into tca intermediates  <cit> . while cyclic tca is reduced in light, it is interesting to note that not many enzymes in glycolysis  and tca cycle  changed in protein abundance as many of these enzymes are regulated allosterically by the atp/adp ratio  <cit> .

traditionally, it was believed that protein expression levels are determined by transcript expression levels. however, our data showed that this is not always true . this discrepancy could be due to the following reasons: a fraction of transcribed mrnas is not translated or is translated at a lower rate  <cit> . there are two pools of mrnas in plant cells: free mrnas and polysomes-associated mrnas. light can promote the association of some mrna to ribosomes and drive their translations. in this case, protein abundance can increase without transcription  <cit> . our rna-seq data only measured the expression levels of steady-state mrna, which is the sum of free and polysomes-associated mrnas. hence, there will be discrepancies between the steady-state mrnas and protein abundance;  some transcribed mrna may have a short half-life  <cit>  for example those that are subject to degradation by srna-mediated processes  <cit> . rna-seq may also sequence partially degraded mrna, which is not translatable. the half-lives of arabidopsis mrna vary from minutes to >24 h. mrnas with shorter half-lives may translate less protein molecules per mrna molecule. our itraq data compared the relative abundance of proteins, which might have been accumulated for hours;  protein abundance is determined by both translation and degradation. protein abundance may drop despite of a constant level of mrna. the above reasons can explain the discrepancies between mrna and protein abundances resulting to the negative correlation that was observed in our study. one of the most interesting examples is the negative correlation between mrna and protein abundance of the photosystem components . such lack of correlation is not only observed for nuclear genes, but also for the genes encoded by the chloroplast genome.

in summary, this study provides integrated datasets on the impacts of light on the transcription and translation of genes encoded by all three genomes of plant cells. the changes of transcriptome and proteome of central metabolisms have been analyzed in details in this report. the datasets will also be useful for researchers interested in secondary metabolisms.

CONCLUSIONS
since proteins are the agents to carry out biochemical conversions and biological processes and in general, there is a lack of positive correlation between mrna transcription and protein levels, the understanding of plant physiology in previous reports, which solely employed microarray or mrna expression data for interpretation, should be carefully interpreted. this study provides leaf omics data on the changes of transcriptome, proteome and metabolite profiles of 20-day-old arabidopsis leaves upon illumination. the data will provide a database to plant researchers to look up their gene of interests and examine their changes in mrna and protein abundance in leaf upon  <dig> and 8 h illumination. this study also provides information on the changes in transcriptome and proteome profiles of chloroplasts and mitochondria upon illumination.
