BACKGROUND
stable isotope tracing is a powerful technique for delineating metabolic pathways and fluxes in response to external perturbations in a wide variety of systems  <cit> . we have been developing stable isotope-resolved metabolomic analysis  for polar and non-polar metabolites in cell and tissue systems to obtain a comprehensive view of the flow of carbon or nitrogen through different metabolic pathways  <cit> .

this approach involves the combined use of nmr and mass spectrometry , both at very high resolution, which respectively provide direct information on positional isotopomers and isotopologues  of labeled metabolites in an unfractionated mixture, thereby minimizing errors from sample processing  <cit> . nmr and ms are complementary structural techniques; both types of analytical information are crucial for accurate reconstruction of metabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of labeled metabolites  <cit> . for complex metabolites that are composed of several metabolic subunits such as udp-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine , the observed isotopologues are mixtures of several positional isotopomers even at the level of the individual metabolic subunits. this degeneracy makes pathway reconstruction and metabolic flux modeling extremely complex. to solve this problem we have developed a technique for deconvoluting 13c isotopologues into all possible labeled subunits with 13c distribution in the subunits mapped based on knowledge of their biosynthetic pathways. this approach is illustrated here with the metabolite udp-glcnac, which is composed of four metabolic modules, namely uracil , ribose , glucose  and acetyl  . the technique can be applied to any complex metabolite where a sufficient number of mass isotopologues can be identified and accurately quantified.

udp-glcnac is an activated precursor for both n-linked and o-linked glycosylation of proteins, which are important in regulating numerous cellular processes, such as protein targeting to organelles  <cit>  and nutrient sensing  <cit> . these two major glycosylation pathways in eukaryotic cells differ in the protein targets and cellular localization  <cit> . with o-linked glycosylation, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins are modified by the transfer of a single β-n-acetylglucosamine  unit from udp-glcnac to the oxygen of ser or thr side chains of proteins. this reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme uridine diphospho-n-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . o-linked glcnacylation has been shown to participate in a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear regulatory processes in response to stress in a fashion both similar and complementary to phosphorylation  <cit> . o-glcnac modified proteins including the polycomb group, p <dig>  c-myc, insulin receptor have been linked to the regulation of embryonic development  <cit> , cancer  <cit>  and diabetes  <cit> . in addition, the synthesis and turnover of these modified proteins are tightly regulated, which implies that the supply of the precursor udp-glcnac must also be tightly regulated.

using ultra-high-resolution and accurate mass fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-ms  and high-resolution nmr, we have identified four major sugar nucleotides including udp-glc and udp-glcnac directly in crude extracts of mammalian cells. the biosynthesis of udp-glcnac is complex as it involves the interplay of both sequential and parallel metabolic pathways . thus, one must simultaneously consider glycolysis, the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway , the krebs cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway when investigating udp-glcnac metabolism. fortunately, isotopomer distributions in several key metabolites  of these pathways, including lactate, glucose, udp-glcnac, and uridine, can be readily identified and quantified by nmr  <cit> . for abundant or sufficiently enriched metabolites, nmr is also excellently suited for following the time evolution of positional isotopomers in cell culture and in vivo . for less abundant metabolites and where isotopic steady state is difficult to achieve, such as in mammalian cell cultures, the more sensitive ft-icr-ms technique is advantageous. however, mass spectrometry measures isotopologues, which must be deconvoluted into individual isotopomer species for dynamic flux analysis.

for flux analysis, detailed times courses are also needed for systems that are not in isotopic steady state. numerous modeling techniques, including metabolic balance analysis  <cit> , metabolic control analysis  <cit>  have been developed which use a series of differential equations to model the flux of metabolites. these techniques typically require steady-state conditions that apply standard numerical methods to solve a system of differential equations in the form of an eigensystem, though there are a few techniques that can be applied to non-steady-state conditions  <cit> . while steady-state conditions are often assumed, in reality they are difficult to establish, maintain, and verify for all relevant metabolites in experiments involving mammalian cells. most of these modeling techniques rely on total metabolite concentrations or isotopic enrichment ratios of a limited number of metabolites, which creates an underdetermined system of equations where there are more variables than independent data. thus, unique meaningful solutions to these numerical systems are not always practical  <cit> .

here, we have used both nmr and ft-icr-ms to probe the biosynthesis of udp-glcnac in prostate cancer cells, coupled with the development of algorithms to deconvolute the resulting ms data. lncap-ln <dig> prostate cancer cells were grown in -glucose to trace the time-dependent fate of individual 13c atoms in different metabolic subunits of udp-glcnac. the 13c isotopologue distribution in udp-glcnac was measured by direct infusion nanoelectrospray ft-icr-ms. as we have previously shown, the resolution in the ms is sufficient to resolve all  <dig> 13c isotopologues of udp-glcnac  from other metabolites and other elemental isotopologues  of udp-glcnac plus providing intensity measurements with an accuracy and precision of better than 1%  <cit> . the ms data was then deconvoluted and modeled using the newly developed algorithm. this combined analytical and computational approach generated much more independent isotopomer data to help minimize the problem under determination. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed kinetic analysis of the udp-glcnac pathways by stable isotope analysis.

RESULTS
metabolism of ln <dig> cells
as with many other cancer cells in culture, 13c glucose is a major source of carbon for nucleotide riboses , amino acids such as ala, glu and asp via glycolysis and the krebs cycle, and pyrimidine rings in lncap-ln <dig> cells. these metabolites are in turn precursors of glutathione, proteins, pyrimidine nucleotides and sugar nucleotides. the unlabeled and labeled metabolite profiles of the ln <dig> cells and media grown in the presence of -glucose were determined by nmr and mass spectrometry as described in the methods section. we have determined the relative rates of consumption of glucose, glutamine and essential amino acid, and lactate production in the medium by nmr . as the number of cells approximately doubled during the measurement period, the determination of the rates of consumption per unit of cells is complicated, and leads to inconstant rates over time, as we have previously discussed  <cit> . the initial rates per mg dry weight are given in additional file  <dig>  under the conditions used , the rate of glutamine consumption was sevenfold slower than the glucose uptake rate. from the rate of 13c lactate excretion, we calculated that about 38% of the consumed glucose was converted to lactate and excreted, which is comparable to other cancer cells in culture  <cit> . furthermore, around 30% of the glucose was consumed by  <dig> h . many other intracellular metabolites and their 13c isotopomers that report on central metabolic pathways were identified and quantified. these included the intracellular lactate and ala, glu, asp and uracil , and the ribose components of the free nucleotide pools that reflect the pentose phosphate pathway . we also identified four sugar nucleotides , which are associated with these carbon flows .

atom percentage 13c enrichments in metabolites after  <dig> h incubation in -glucose were determined from two-dimensional 1h tocsy experiments as described in the methods section. uracil in uxp refers to the uracil ring in the free nucleotide pool comprising utp, udp and ump. axp and uxp ribose refer to the ribose moiety in the free nucleotide pools. udp-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine  refers to the c1-c <dig> of the glucose moiety of the free udp-glcnac pool.

identification of sugar nucleotides
isotopomer distributions of metabolites determined by nmr
udp-glcnac is composed of four metabolic units or modules, each of which is synthesized in different pathways . the glucose unit derives directly from the supplied glucose without metabolic scrambling, as these cells are not known to be gluconeogenic. similarly, the ribose can also be derived from the supplied glucose, or from the turnover of existing ribonucleotides. the uracil unit may be derived from rna turnover, or de novo synthesis, which requires carbon input from aspartate and co <dig>  aspartate can be produced by protein turnover or transamination of oxalacetate  . oaa can incorporate carbon from acetyl coa, which is derived from glucose, or from glutamine carbon entering the krebs cycle via glutaminolysis  <cit> . the acetyl moiety is derived either from glycolysis or fatty acid oxidation. the glucose pathways were readily discriminated from the non-glucose pathways by tracing the 13c label from -glucose into the various biosynthetic intermediates, as well as in udp-glcnac itself .

after introduction of -glucose enriched medium, the free intracellular glucose was rapidly replaced by -glucose, and the metabolically proximal metabolites, such as the ribose rings of the free nucleotides also became highly labeled. the glycolysis markers, ala and lactate were preferentially labeled from the glucose source, and the glucose unit within udp-glcnac became > 90% enriched in 13c by  <dig> h. based on the nmr data, these markers were either the all 13c, or the all 12c form, after correcting for natural abundance 13c at approximately  <dig> %) . in contrast, the downstream metabolites that report on both glycolysis and krebs cycle activity  were considerably less 13c labeled, and also showed scrambling due to reactions with unlabeled intermediates in the krebs cycle  . a significant source of unlabeled krebs cycle intermediates is glutamine . as asp is a direct precursor of uracil biosynthesis, we expected the final product would also show scrambled labeling patterns; the labeling pattern in asp was essentially identical to that of u in uxp, as expected for a direct precursor-product relationship .

isotopologues of udp-glcnac determined by ft-icr-ms
the  <dig> possible 13c isotopologues of udp-glcnac in ln <dig> cell extracts were analyzed using direct infusion nanoelectrospray ft-icr-ms, which is especially well suited for mass isotopologue analysis. ft-icr-ms requires no derivatization, the relative intensities are significantly more accurate than conventional ms, routine mass accuracy is better than  <dig>  ppm, and the analysis is relatively high-throughput. most importantly, the extremely high mass resolution makes interference from other metabolites and non-13c isotopologues highly unlikely  <cit> . moreover, the high sensitivity and small sample requirements  make the technique well suited for timecourse measurements. the spectral assignments of the udp-glcnac isotopologues in ln <dig> extracts are shown in figure 6a, along with timecourse changes at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post labeling. the isotopologue peaks of udp-glcnac are tagged as m <dig> to m0+ <dig>  which represent the monoisotopic  to 13c <dig> species. the detailed timecourses of various isotopologue intensities are shown in figure 6b, which display a typical precursor product relationship. some isotopologues  were not sufficiently enriched to determine the timecourse, and thus were not plotted. the m <dig> peak disappeared rapidly with a half life of  <dig>  h , reflecting replacement of the initial pool of unlabeled udp-glcnac by newly synthesized 13c isotopologues. at zero time the fraction of the m <dig> peak was about 85%, close to the expected 83% from natural abundance. in contrast, the intensity of other isotopologues increased with time, and some took more than  <dig> d to become significantly labeled.

isotopologue analysis
starting with 13c glucose, the complete synthesis of udp-glcnac leads to a total of  <dig> isotopologues , many of which comprise several isotopomers. however, as each isotopologue was independently quantified and the intensity profile contained more measurements than the number of independent isotopomer species, the observed profile can be deconvoluted into the individual isotopomer components in terms of biochemical units. the intensity at a given mass is the sum of the intensities of the individual isotopic species at that mass, and the net intensity due to 13c enrichment was corrected for natural abundance 13c contribution using the previously described stripping algorithm  <cit> .

algorithm
udp-glcnac comprises four biochemical units: glucose , ribose , acetyl  and  uracil ; g <dig>  r <dig>  a <dig> and u <dig> represent the probability of finding unlabeled glucose, ribose, acetyl and uracil, respectively. the nmr data  showed that the glucose and ribose units existed significantly only as fully 13c-labeled g <dig> and r <dig>  or completely unlabeled  forms, after  <dig> and  <dig> h of labeling. furthermore, the mass isotopologue timecourse  showed absence of m <dig> to m <dig> intensity, which is consistent with these subunits being enriched with all 13c or none. however, it was unclear from the nmr data whether the possibility of isotopic mixing existed for the acetyl unit, which was specifically considered in the modeling .

if g <dig> represents the mole fraction of 12c <dig> glucose, g <dig>  it follows that:   

and similarly for the ribose and acetyl units,   

the biosynthesis of uracil mixes carbon from glucose and other sources such as glutamine through the krebs cycle. this leads to several isotopologues, namely u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> where the indices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> refer to the number of 13c atoms in the ring, which can be measured by nmr . moreover, these probabilities sum to unity:   

hence, there are  <dig> undetermined parameters to be calculated, and up to  <dig> possible isotopomers. however, at each timepoint there are  <dig> intensity measurements. if in denotes the intensity of the nth isotopologue, then using eq.  <dig> and 2:   

to solve these simultaneous equations , we have developed a general simulated annealing/genetic algorithm for parameter optimization called genetic algorithm for isotopologues in metabolic systems   <cit> , . this algorithm robustly finds the optimal solution for all intensities via fitting of these six independent parameters . the target function, t, which is minimized, is defined in eq.  as:   

where, in,obs and in,calc are the observed and calculated intensities, respectively, at a given timepoint. this optimization method used a linear annealing regime along with a 5% crossover rate and a population size of  <dig>  furthermore, three variables were mutated per step to handle any issues of dependency between variables. each optimization used  <dig> steps and was repeated  <dig> times to verify robustness  and to provide statistics. in addition, gaims was applied to over  <dig> variant models that include the possibility of other isotopomers in the various subunits  and a robust model selection method using the akaike information criterion   <cit> , which was applied to average optimized parameter values.

testing and implementation
the mole fractions of individual isotopomers were calculated from the isotopologue intensity distributions in figure 6b using the six-parameter optimizations from the gaims algorithm as described in the methods section. in addition, we used the akaike information criteria -based model selection method described in the methods section to select among  <dig> variant models . the best model according to these criteria, which also made the most biological sense, was our original six-parameter model. specifically, allowing for all isotopomers of the acetyl unit produced significantly worse aic values  <cit> , justifying our original approximation on all or none 13c labeling in the acetyl unit post hoc.

the reconstruction of the isotopologue distribution from gaims modeling was compared with the observed values, as shown in figure 7b for the  <dig> h timepoint. the agreement was as good as the variance in the data, and further modeling that included more species  gave no improvement of the fitting, according to a variety of criteria . thus, based on the model calculation, the fraction of the uniformly 13c-labeled glucose, ribose, acetyl units in udp-glcnac were respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , while the fraction of singly, doubly, and triply 13c-labeled uracil units was respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  at  <dig> h. these compare favorably with the independent isotopomer analysis by nmr at  <dig> h of incubation .

discussion
we have unequivocally identified four udp-hexoses in ln <dig> cells using a combination of nmr and ft-icr-ms data. in these cells, the most abundant sugar nucleotide was udp-glcnac , whereas in other cancer or normal cells , udp-glc is the major sugar nucleotide . the abundance of udp-glcnac in ln <dig> cells could mean a high synthesis rate, which could in turn drive a high ogt activity  <cit> .

as figure  <dig> shows, the biosynthesis of udp-glcnac is complex, involving the coordination of glycolysis, krebs cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, pyrimidine biosynthesis, and hexosamine biosynthesis. the total concentration of udp-glcnac  was maintained constant in ln <dig> cells over the timecourse, that is, at a steady state in which utilization was balanced by de novo synthesis. however, the 13c incorporation into the individual intermediates did not approach isotopic steady state for at least  <dig> h . thus, non-steady-state approaches  <cit>  are required for the flux analysis.

the approach that we introduced here enabled a quantitative analysis of fractional contribution of relevant pathways to the synthesis of udp-glcnac, regardless of whether the steady-state conditions are met. the udp-glcnac molecule was dissected into four biochemical modules, each of which can utilize glucose as the carbon source. the exception is uracil, where one of the carbons comes from bicarbonate. in addition to glucose, alternative sources of carbon were also considered. the hexose unit in ln <dig> cells should derive exclusively from the supplied -glucose in the medium since there was no evidence for active gluconeogenesis in these cells. the ribose unit of the utp pool was also derived mainly from -glucose. acetyl coa could be made from pyruvate via glycolysis, by fatty acid oxidation, or from glutaminolysis  <cit>  by way of malic enzyme. for uracil, the c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> carbons were derived from aspartate, which could be obtained from protein degradation or by the transamination of oaa. oaa could in turn come from -glucose via the krebs cycle or amino acid oxidation, especially glutamine, which is a more direct carbon source than glucose. our 6-parameter model based on the above rationalization of 13c incorporation from -glucose was corroborated by its comparison and preferred selection from over  <dig> variant models, representing many alternate pathways discussed above.

the resulting modeled timecourses for the various labeled intermediates  are as expected for a largely sequential series of reactions. the isotopologue m0+ <dig> represents the first labeled intermediate generated in the complex pathways . all other significantly populated intermediates show clear lag phases as expected for sequential reactions that are effectively irreversible. it is notable that the length of the lag period increased as the number of 13c atoms increased , which reflects the increasing number of reactions needed to achieve the labeling.

the decay of the fraction of the m <dig> species  was quasi exponential  and can be regarded as the rate of udp-glcnac utilization . since the total concentration of udp-glcnac was constant, a decrease in the fraction of m <dig> was compensated by the synthesis of udp-glcnac . the initial rate of formation of the m0+ <dig> species was essentially equal to the rate of loss of m <dig> , which corresponds to two possible isotopomer species . during the initial periods, the most likely species would be 13c5-ribose , as the acetyl coa and uracil units take longer to become labeled and did not reach such a high degree of labeling . thereafter, the rapid rise and disappearance of the m0+ <dig> isotopologue in figure 6b indicates that initially the glucose, uracil and acetyl units of udp-glcnac arose from pre-existing unlabeled sources, and that these sources are depleted relatively rapidly. only then will de novo synthesis of udp-glcnac have an increasing contribution from labeled glucose, uracil and acetyl coa, leading to the fractional decrease of the m0+ <dig> isotopologue.

the present timecourse was acquired by discrete sampling at separate timepoints, which could be done more elegantly by continuous in vivo nmr measurement  <cit> . however, udp-glcnac is a relatively low abundance metabolite, which was difficult to detect by nmr. more importantly, the in vivo nmr analysis would lack the necessary resolving power to quantify as many isotopomer species of udp-glcnac as required for the modeling effort. the superior sensitivity and resolution of the ft-icr-ms techniques outweigh the in vivo nmr advantage and enabled modeling of the flux through the complex pathway, with much less ambiguity and under non-isotopic steady-state conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have unequivocally identified four udp-hexoses in ln <dig> cells of which the most abundant was udp-glcnac using a combination of nmr and ft-icr-ms data. the 13c incorporation into the individual intermediates did not approach isotopic steady state for at least  <dig> h, thus requiring non-steady-state approaches for flux analysis.

our non-steady-state approach enabled a quantitative analysis of fractional contribution of relevant pathways to the synthesis of udp-glcnac, by partitioning the udp-glcnac molecule into four biochemical modules , each of which can utilize glucose as the carbon source. our analysis indicated a rapid incorporation of labeled ribose via the pentose phosphate pathway and direct glucose incorporation. slower incorporation occurred for labeled acetyl units and uracil via glycolysis and the krebs cycle.

such quantitative deconvolution of udp-glcnac isotopologues into fractional contribution of individual pathways  sets the stage for a detailed flux analysis of udp-glcnac biosynthesis and utilization, which is work in progress. since the ft-icr-ms and nmr data also provided labeling patterns of numerous other metabolites in the nucleotide sugar pathways, the flux analysis can be readily extended to the network of other nucleotide sugars. because modular biosynthetic processes occur commonly in cellular metabolism , the approach described should be of general applicability.
