BACKGROUND
the heat-shock response is a universal reaction in nature to defend cells against the temperature-induced damage. cells of bacteria or almost any organism respond to sudden increase in temperature by synthesizing a set of proteins called the heat-shock proteins . in e. coli, heat-shock regulon includes genes for about  <dig> proteins and is induced after a temperature up-shift from  <dig> to 45°c. the hsps counter the effects of heat by serving as 1) molecular chaperones  that assist in the refolding of the partially denatured proteins and 2) proteases  that degrade and remove the permanently denatured proteins  <cit> . not only important during heat stress, many hsps are present at the basal level in cells to assist protein folding  <cit> . transcription of the heat shock genes is known to be initiated by rna polymerase, which contains the alternative sigma factor sigma- <dig>  <cit> . at normal growth condition, cellular concentration of sigma- <dig> is very low  and increases up to 12– <dig> folds with the temperature up-shift  <cit> .

instead of heat, cytoplasmic accumulation of the membrane or periplasmic proteins elevates the syntheses of hsps in e. coli. any membrane or periplasmic protein of e. coli is known to be synthesized initially in cell cytoplasm as precursor form, which contains an n-terminal signal-sequence  <cit> . the signal sequence targets the precursor towards the plasma membrane translocase that transports the precursor across the membrane  <cit> . the signal peptide is then cleaved by a signal peptidase, an integral membrane protein with active site facing the periplasm  <cit> . the matured protein is then positioned at its membrane or periplasmic location with functionally correct orientation. the pmf across e. coli plasma membrane acts as an energy source for protein translocation  <cit> . the inhibition of translocation and consequent storage of membrane proteins in cell cytosol is found to induce hsps in export deficient mutants   <cit> , in signal sequence mutants   <cit> , and in wild type cells treated with protonophores like cccp or dnp  <cit> . however, it is still obscure how the inhibition of protein translocation phenomenon is related to the induction of cellular heat-shock response at the molecular level. therefore, in the present study, we target to investigate 1) how the cellular level of the heat-shock regulator protein sigma- <dig> is modulated under the condition of inhibition of protein translocation by the protonophores like cccp/dnp, 2) what is the final fate of the non-translocated proteins, stored in cell cytoplasm and 3) how the induced hsps do interact with the non-translocated proteins.

pulse-label/pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments
cells of e. coli mph <dig> were initially grown to the log phase  at 30°c in mops medium  and were subsequently transferred to the methionine-free mops medium.

for pulse-label and immunoprecipitation experiment, log phase grown cells in methionine-free mops medium were allowed to grow further at 30°c. at different instants of growth,  <dig> ml cell aliquot was withdrawn to label with 35s-methionine  for  <dig> min. the labeled cells were treated with 5% trichloroacitic acid. the protein precipitate was washed with 80% cold acetone. the air dried precipitate was suspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris buffer  containing 1% sds and  <dig> mm edta. it was then heated at 100°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> μl of this sample was diluted with  <dig> ml of triton x- <dig> buffer  and centrifuged to remove nonspecific precipitates. from the supernatant, for immunoprecipitation of any protein, requisite amount of the antibody to that protein was added and subsequently incubated overnight at 0°c. to this incubated sample,  <dig> μl of proteina-cl agarose was added and incubated further at 0°c for  <dig> min. the immunocomplex was washed and finally suspended in  <dig> μl of 2× sample buffer  <cit> , heated at 100°c for  <dig> min prior to loading on 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis; finally phosphorimaging of the gel was performed in typhoon  <dig> .

for determination of the location of ap, the periplasmic, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of cells were isolated from  <dig>  ml of ap induced cell culture, as described in  <cit> . after electrophoresis of the fractions in 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel, 'western blot' experiment with anti-ap antibody was performed.

RESULTS
in this study, investigations were carried out to establish the correlation in molecular detail between the phenomena of inhibition of protein translocation and induction of hsps in e. coli, grown in the presence of protonophores like cccp and dnp. therefore, growth of e. coli cells in the presence of different concentrations of the protonophores was studied first and the results indicated that the increasing concentrations of cccp  or dnp  in the growth medium had gradually slowed down the cell growth, causing bacteriostatic condition at  <dig> μm cccp or  <dig>  mm dnp . when checked using 2-d gel electrophoresis technique, cell growth in the presence of cccp  or dnp was found to induce the hsps like clpb, dnak, groel, grpe, clpp, and groes in e. coli cell ; protonophores-mediated induction of hsps were reported earlier . as, in all the following experiments, the results for cccp  and dnp  separately were qualitatively similar, the results for the cccp only have been presented here. at different intervals of growth in the presence of cccp, when the rate of groel synthesis was investigated by the pulse-label and immunoprecipitation experiment using anti-groel antibody, the result showed that the rate had increased with time up to  <dig> min , beyond which it had declined. this implied that the maximum induction of hsps had taken place after  <dig> minutes of cell growth in the presence of  <dig> μm cccp. after  <dig> min of cell growth, when the western blot experiment of cell extract was performed using anti-sigma- <dig> antibody, the result  showed that the cellular level of the heat-shock regulator protein sigma- <dig> had also been increased  by the cccp treatment. fig. 1b also showed that the level of sigma- <dig> in normal cells was so low in amount that it had no trace  in the western blot. similar enhancement of cellular sigma- <dig> level was found to take place in cells grown at 50°c .

under heat stress, the increase in sigma- <dig> was known to be caused by two means – by the increase in sigma- <dig> translation and by the stabilization of normally unstable sigma- <dig>  control of sigma- <dig> translation was mainly mediated by two cis-acting elements on sigma- <dig> mrna; extensive base pairing between the elements formed secondary structure in sigma- <dig> mrna, which had prevented its entry into the ribosome and consequently the translation initiation. the thermal induction of translation resulted from melting of the mrna secondary structure at increased temperature  <cit> . again, control of sigma- <dig> stabilization is mediated by the hsps like dnak/j and ftsh; normally at 30°c, the dnak/j chaperone system binds with sigma- <dig>  limiting its binding to core rna polymerase  <cit>  and the ftsh, an atp-dependent metalloprotease, degrades sigma- <dig>   <cit> . upon heat stress, the chaperone system dnak/j becomes engaged with the increased cellular level of unfolded proteins and thus makes the sigma- <dig> free and stable  <cit> .

at different intervals of growth in the presence of cccp, when the rate of sigma- <dig> synthesis was measured by the pulse-label and immunoprecipitation experiment, no change in the rate with the time of cell growth was observed ; whereas in cells grown at 50°c, the rate had increased up to  <dig> min , after which it declined. therefore, the rise in cellular sigma- <dig> level and thereby induction of hsps in e. coli by cccp treatment did not occur by the enhanced synthesis of sigma- <dig>  this result also indicated that the cccp could not denature the secondary structure present in sigma- <dig> mrna and thus entry of the mrna into the ribosome and consequent increase of translation had been prevented. on the other hand, when the sigma- <dig> stabilization was investigated with the help of pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiment, no change in sigma- <dig> band intensity had been observed in the cccp-treated cells up to  <dig> minutes of chasing ; whereas in case of control cells, sigma- <dig> intensity had been almost halved in  <dig> minutes of chasing , signifying stabilization of sigma- <dig> in cells by cccp treatment. when checked, sigma- <dig> was also found to be stabilized in cells grown at 50°c . the above results, therefore, implied clearly that for induction of hsps in the cccp-treated cells, cellular level of sigma- <dig> had been increased, not by its increased rate of synthesis, but by its increased stabilization.

besides induction of hsps, protonophores were known to inhibit translocation of the membrane and periplasmic proteins, resulting in their accumulation in cell cytosol as non-functional precursor form  <cit> . in order to find out the detailed molecular correlation between protonophores-mediated induction of heat-shock-like response and inhibition of protein translocation, the inducible periplasmic protein ap of e. coli was selected here as the representative target protein for the translocation experiments. ap was a nonspecific phosphomonoesterase, used to generate inorganic phosphate from a variety of phosphorylated derivatives. the ap gene was known to be inducible as its expression was negatively regulated by the inorganic phosphate – the end product of ap digestion. thus, the addition of phosphate to the growth medium repressed the induction of ap or in other words, phosphate-less growth medium induced ap in e. coli  <cit> . when ap was induced in presence of the protonophores, the level of cellular active ap, at any instant of growth, had decreased gradually by the presence of increasing concentrations of cccp   or dnp   in the growth medium. at  <dig> μm cccp concentration, the amount of enzymatically active ap was almost absent. however, the western blot study of the periplasmic, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of cells using anti-ap antibody  showed that the lane g, where the cytoplasmic fraction of the cccp-treated cells was loaded, had contained the induced ap. no considerable ap band was observed in the lanes , where the periplasmic and membrane fractions of the cccp-treated cells were loaded respectively. on the other hand, in the case of cccp-untreated control cells, approximately equal amount of ap was found to be present in both periplasmic  and cytoplasmic  fractions; no trace of ap was found in the membrane fraction . the ap in the cytoplasmic fraction of the control cells , perhaps, represented the amount of ap that had yet to be translocated to the periplasm. the result of this study revealed that by the presence of cccp  in the growth medium, the induced ap could not be transported out from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. the less intensity of the ap band in lane g compared to the sum of the intensities in lanes b and c implied less induction of ap in cells grown in the presence of cccp with respect to the control cells; this was consistent with the fact of low growth rate of the cccp-treated cells . the result of this study, therefore, indicated that the presence of cccp-like protonophore in the growth medium had partially reduced the induction of ap; however, the induced ap could not be transported out from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. ap was known to be synthesized initially in the cytoplasm and then translocated out through the inner membrane to be finally localized as dimeric, active form at the periplasm  <cit> . as the dimerization of ap, through the disulfide bond, could not take place in the reducing milieu of the cytoplasmic environment, the cytosolic pool of the nontranslocated ap in the cccp-treated cells had shown no activity  <cit> .

to investigate whether the non-translocated ap in cell cytosol could have been transported out to the periplasm on withdrawal of cccp from the growth medium, pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. cells, grown in phosphate-free  and methionine-free mops medium in the presence of  <dig> μm cccp, were radio-labeled with 35s-methionine for  <dig> min; the cccp was then removed by centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in the phosphate-less mops medium. finally the chasing with cold methionine was allowed for  <dig> hr. the periplasmic fractions of the chased cells were isolated, immunoprecipitated with anti-ap antibody, the immunoprecipitates were run in 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel, western blotting with anti-ap antibody was done and the blotted membrane was finally autoradiographed  <cit> . the autoradiograph  showed that the periplasmic fraction of the cccp-treated cells had contained no trace of ap , whereas that of the control cells contained it . this signified that the ap, synthesized during the presence of cccp , could not be translocated out to the periplasm, even after  <dig> min of chasing in the absence of cccp. the western blot result  showed that the periplasmic fraction of both the cccp-treated  and untreated  cells had contained ap. this implied that after the removal of cccp, the newly synthesized ap  had been exported out to the periplasm. this result can, therefore, be summarized as – the ap, once induced in the presence of cccp and accumulated in the cell cytoplasm, had never crossed the cytoplasmic membrane ; on contrary the ap, newly induced in the same cells after withdrawal of cccp, had crossed the cytoplasmic membrane to be located in the periplasm .

in order to investigate that whether any aggregation occurred in the non-functional, permanently stored ap pool in cell cytosol, the total soluble and insoluble fractions of cells were isolated at different intervals of growth in the presence of  <dig> μm cccp, and the western blot study of the fractions was performed using anti-ap antibody. both the fractions were found to contain ap , indicating that the stored ap was partly in the aggregated and partly in the dispersed form. moreover, fig. 6a showed that the amount of ap in each fraction had increased gradually with the time of ap induction in the presence of cccp. it should be mentioned here that in the control cells, the amount of insoluble fraction was negligible and the ap was found to be present only in the soluble fraction .

the presence of aggregated proteins in cells was reported to elicit induction of hsps for cell survival  <cit> . therefore, in the following experiments, focus was made on the ultimate fate of the ap-aggregates in cytoplasm of the protonophores-treated cells, with a view to observe the role of induced hsps on the aggregates. the result of the following 'pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation' experiment on the e. coli strain sg <dig> showed degradation of the ap-aggregate with time. for this study, log phase grown cells, in phosphate- and methionine-free mops medium, were allowed to label with 35s-methionine  at 30°c in the presence of  <dig> μm cccp. after  <dig> min of labeling, cells were transferred to fresh phosphate-free mops medium containing  <dig> mm bsa and  <dig> μg/ml spectinomycin and allowed to incubate further for  <dig> hr without cccp. at  <dig> and  <dig> hr of chasing, equal volume of cell aliquot was withdrawn on ice, centrifuged and subjected to isolation of aggregated proteins. the isolated aggregates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ap antibody. the immunocomplex was run on 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel, the gel was dried and subsequently set to autoradiography. the autoradiograph  of the electrophoresed immunoprecipitates indicated that the amount of ap-aggregate, after  <dig> hr of chasing , was about 66% less than its initial amount at  <dig> hr of chasing . this signified that the ap-aggregate had been degraded finally with time. it seemed that the degradation of ap-aggregate had been possibly caused by some induced heat-shock protease. when the degradation of the cccp-mediated ap-aggregate was checked, by the same 'pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation' experiment in two different e. coli mutants for the heat-shock proteases lon  and clpp , it was observed that in the clpp mutant, no degradation of the ap-aggregate took place ; whereas in the lon mutant, degradation occurred . this result clearly implied that not the major heat-shock protease lon, rather a minor protease clpp was responsible for the degradation phenomenon. such degradation removed the translocation-incompetent, non-functional ap and thus was essential for cell survival; this was supplemented from the fact that the clpp mutant  was more sensitive to cccp than wild type strain sg <dig>  in the presence of  <dig> μm cccp, where the wild type cells had some growth, the mutant cells became bacteriostatic, and by the treatment of  <dig> μm cccp for  <dig> min, where there was no killing of e. coli sg <dig> cells, about 90% cell-killing occurred in case of e. coli sg <dig> strain .

when the cell extract of ap-induced culture was subjected to two-step immunoprecipitation study using anti-dnak and anti-ap antibodies serially, the final immunoprecipitate of the cccp-treated cells, in contrast to that of the control cells, had contained ap in addition to the dnak protein . this clearly signified that the first immunoprecipitate with anti-dnak antibody had certainly contained ap i.e., the non-translocated ap in the cccp-treated cells was present in cell cytosol as a binary complex form with dnak. this result justified the fact of sigma- <dig> stabilization in the protonophores-treated cells as – the non-translocated proteins had signaled dnak/j to bind with them, finally freeing and so stabilizing sigma- <dig>  this was further confirmed by our observation that in the cells containing over-expressed dnak, the cccp could not trigger the induction of hsps ; this was because the sigma- <dig> could not be freed from the dnak to bind with the rna polymarease, due to the excess cellular pool of dnak protein. for this study, cells of e. coli mph <dig> were transformed with plasmid pet vector containing dnak gene and the dnak protein was over-expressed by using  <dig> mm iptg in the mops growth medium. when such excess dnak-containing cells were subsequently grown in the presence of  <dig> μm cccp and the cell extract was immunoprecipitated using anti-groel antibody, no induction of groel had been observed in the cccp-treated transformed cells ; whereas the induction had occurred in the cccp-treated untransformed cells . this result implied that no induction of hsps had taken place in the cccp-treated cells having excess amount of dnak chaperone.

CONCLUSIONS
the whole study can, therefore, be concluded as: the protonophores like cccp and dnp, by blocking the translocation of membrane and periplasmic proteins in e. coli, caused cytoplasmic accumulation of those proteins – partly in the insoluble aggregated form and partly in the soluble dispersed form; such stored proteins, which could never be translocated out even after removal of the protonophores, had induced cellular heat-shock response enhancing the syntheses of a few heat-shock chaperones and proteases – perhaps, the heat-shock protease clpp ultimately degraded the non-translocated protein-aggregates to remove them from the cell. moreover, the induction of hsps had taken place mainly due to stabilization of the normally unstable heat-shock regulator protein sigma-32; the stabilization had occurred due to titration of the chaperone system dnak/j by the non-translocated, inactive periplasmic and membrane proteins stored in the cytoplasm of the cccp-treated cells, because the titration consequently made the sigma- <dig> free of dnak/j and so prevented its cleavage by the ftsh protease.
