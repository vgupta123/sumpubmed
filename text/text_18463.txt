BACKGROUND
current tropospheric o <dig> concentrations  are estimated to cost $ <dig> to $ <dig> billion in annual global crop economic losses  <cit>  and severely impact human health, accounting for an estimated  <dig>  million deaths per year  <cit> . ozone in the troposphere is formed through the photochemical oxidation of volatile organic compounds , carbon monoxide and methane in the presence of nitrogen oxides   <cit> . ozone is a dynamic pollutant and concentrations vary temporally and spatially, with higher concentrations in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere, and typically higher  in the summer compared to the winter  <cit> . background tropospheric  have more than doubled since the industrial revolution and are projected to increase by an additional ~20% by the year  <dig> if current high emission rates continue  <cit> . in the crop growing regions of the northern hemisphere, summer concentrations of o <dig> often exceed 40 ppb, which exceeds the critical threshold for damage to sensitive crops, including soybean   <cit> .

when taken up by plants, o <dig> is converted into other reactive oxygen species , and can induce signaling pathways that lead to programmed cell death, especially with exposure to very high   <cit> . at lower concentrations, chronic exposure to elevated  decreases photosynthetic carbon assimilation and stomatal conductance, and accelerates the process of senescence  <cit> . in addition to leaf-level effects, o <dig> negatively impacts plant fitness and reproductive development, which can be mediated through reduced carbon allocation from source tissues and/or through direct effects on reproductive tissues  <cit> . a meta-analysis of published studies from  <dig> to  <dig> of o <dig> effects on plant reproductive processes reported that exposure to elevated  decreased seed number and seed size, as well as fruit number and fruit size when compared to plants grown in charcoal-filtered, o3-free air  <cit> . however, the meta-analysis also showed that elevated  did not significantly alter inflorescence number, flower weight or flower number  <cit> . this suggests that plants can compensate to some extent from o <dig> damage  <cit> , and also that the effects of o <dig> can be tissue-specific.

soybeans have naturally high levels of floral and pod loss, and subsequent seed and yield loss is greatest when stress occurs during flower and early pod development  <cit> . flower and pod abscission can range from  <dig> to 82% in soybean  <cit> , but this varies considerably with location on the plant  <cit> , location in the canopy  <cit> , source-sink relations  <cit> , hormone levels  <cit> , shade  <cit>  and water status  <cit> . ethylene promotes flower and pod abscission in soybean  <cit> , and elevated  can increase ethylene emission in plants  <cit> . therefore, elevated  has the potential to increase flower and pod abscission. in field-grown soybean exposed to elevated  for an entire growing season  <cit> , pod production was decreased by elevated , but flower number was not affected . based on this evidence from the field, it is hypothesized that the transcriptional responses of soybean flowers and pods to elevated  would be distinct.figure  <dig>

previous studies have examined changes in transcript abundance in plants in response to elevated   <cit> ; however, most of these studies have focused on leaves. in soybean, both flower and pod tissues also have stomata through which o <dig> could enter and elicit a signaling response  <cit> . next-generation sequencing technology allows examination of changes to the entire transcriptome, which could facilitate interpretation of the complex phenotypes that underpin o <dig> response in plants. by investigating how elevated  affects the transcriptome of reproductive tissues, we can begin to understand the distinct responses in different tissues and identify potential targets for improving tolerance. therefore, in this study, the transcriptome of flower and pod tissue from chamber-grown soybean plants at ambient  and elevated   was investigated. both flower and pod tissues showed significant transcriptomic responses to elevated . while  <dig> transcripts were responsive to elevated  in both tissues, most of those transcripts did not change in the same direction or at the same magnitude in flowers and pods, indicating that the transcriptional response to o <dig> in different reproductive tissues was distinct.

RESULTS
overlapping effects of elevated  on the transcriptome of flower and pod tissue in soybean
flower and pod development in soybean are sensitive to environmental stress  <cit> , and elevated  significantly impacted pod production, but not flower production . in order to identify the genetic mechanisms underpinning o <dig> response in soybean pods and flowers, the transcriptome of flower and pod tissues was compared using rna-sequencing . the global transcriptional analysis showed the magnitude of potential responses to elevated  in flowers and pods was similar, with genes showing approximately the same range of both mean expression values in flowers and pods, and similar potential log fold change responses to elevated  in the two tissues . however, more than three times as many genes were differentially expressed in flower tissue  than in pod tissue  in response to elevated , and only  <dig> of those genes were differentially expressed in both flowers and pods .figure  <dig>

differentially expressed genes in pods and flowers were grouped into functional categories . nine of  <dig> total functional categories showed pod and flower genes changing in the same direction in response to elevated  . transcripts involved in signaling, development, transport, stress, protein and rna were expressed at greater levels on average in both pods and flowers exposed to elevated  compared to control . while average changes in expression based on functional categories suggests that there was overlap in the transcriptional response of flowers and pods to elevated , investigation of individual genes showed that there was not good correspondence of the direction or magnitude of the response . less than half of the  <dig> genes that were significantly affected by elevated  in both flowers and pods responded in a similar direction, with  <dig> of the  <dig> genes increasing in both tissues in response to elevated  and  <dig> decreasing in both tissues in response to elevated  . many of the transcripts that fell on the 1: <dig> line in figure  <dig> were involved in signaling and rna processing, including  <dig> leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases  and  <dig> cysteine-rich domain of unknown function  <dig>  rlks . plant rlks are transmembrane proteins involved in signal perception and form a large multi-gene family with regulatory roles in development, abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants  <cit> . recent analysis of the response of arabidopsis duf <dig> rlks showed that many of the  <dig> rlks were specifically up-regulated in response to o <dig> stress in leaves  <cit> , including duf <dig>  <dig> , duf <dig>  <dig>  and duf <dig>  <dig> , which also had a significant increase in expression in soybean pods and flowers exposed to elevated . wraczek et al.  <cit>  found that the general pattern of duf <dig> expression responses to o <dig> was most similar to the transcriptional response to pathogen infection, which like o <dig> elicits an ros burst in the apolost. the transcriptional response to o <dig> however, was very different from expression responses to high light treatments or chemical treatments that increased ros production in chloroplasts or mitochondria  <cit> . thus, it was further suggested that the duf <dig> domain, which has a conserved cysteine motif c-8x-c-2x-c, could act as an apolastic ros sensor  <cit> .figure  <dig>

a number of wrky domain transcription factors also showed significantly greater expression under elevated  in both soybean flowers and pods . the wrky transcription factor family is one of the largest families of transcription factors in plants, with  <dig> members in the soybean genome  <cit> . wrkys function in many plant processes including response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and senescence  <cit> . up-regulation of wrky transcription factors in response to o <dig> stress has been previous reported, primarily in the leaves of trees  <cit> . two of the wrky transcription factors with increased expression in both flower and pod tissues in response to elevated   were likely formed through a segmental duplication event that is estimated to have occurred  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

distinct effects of elevated  on the transcriptome of flower and pod tissue in soybean
although there was some overlap in transcriptional responses to elevated  in flowers and pods, the vast majority of genes changing in either tissue were distinct , and even among the genes that were expressed in both flower and pod tissues, the fold changes in expression were of different magnitudes or in the opposite direction . in flower tissue, the genes with the greatest increase in abundance in response to elevated  included matrix metalloproteinase  genes and genes related to hormone metabolism and signaling . genes annotated as mmps also had high mean expression levels . while little is known about their role in soybean flowers, in other tissues mmps function in degradation of the extracellular matrix  in response to senescence, stress and programmed cell death  <cit> . domain analysis indicated that  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes annotated as mmps had both a cysteine switch domain and a zinc-binding domain, both of which are required for characterization as a mmp   <cit> . those genes with both required domains were termed putative soybean flower mmp genes.table  <dig>

the putative mmp gene glyma02g <dig> had two identical cysteine switch domains and zinc-binding domains, which was unique compared to the other putative flower mmp genes. all putative flower mmp genes had a signal peptide and transmembrane domain, with the exception of glyma02g <dig> . several of the putative flower mmp genes contained a gpi-anchor modification site, which was similar to  <dig> arabidopsis mmp genes, at2-mmp, at4-mmp, at5-mmp  <cit> , and the known soybean mmp gene gmmmp <dig>   <cit>  . none of the putative flower mmp genes or known soybean genes   <cit>  contained a furin cleavage site, which was present in several arabidopsis mmp genes. when amino acid sequence similarity identity was compared between all putative flower mmp genes and gm2-mmp using clustal w , little homology between the flower mmp and leaf mmp genes was found, with the exception of glyma01g <dig> which showed 99% sequence similarity to gm2-mmp . all putative flower mmp genes, with the exception of glyma01g <dig>  had an e  to q  residue substitution in the zinc-binding motif of the catalytic domain, which has been identified in other legume species  <cit> . the glutamate residue is required for functional protease activity  <cit> , thus the amino acid switch in soybean flower mmps may render these inactive. still, they may be important for o <dig> stress response because experiments with medicago truncatula have also demonstrated a functional role for proteolytically-inactive mmps in biotic stress response  <cit> .

the responsiveness of putative soybean flower mmps to elevated  is consistent with the ecm being the primary point of o <dig> contact within plant cells and the location where antioxidant metabolism begins to protect cells from ros damage  <cit> . stress-responsive signaling pathways, including jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene-dependent redox signaling are all triggered by the redox sensing that occurs in the ecm  <cit> . the soybean mmp gene gm2-mmp was up-regulated consistently with the release of ros during pathogenic infection  <cit> , possibly linking ros signaling and mmp gene expression in soybean stress response. previous analysis of arabidopsis mmp gene expression revealed that at3-mmp was expressed at greater abundance in response to o <dig> treatment, with a slight increase in at2-mmp in response to o <dig> as well  <cit> . while the putative mmp genes are present in high abundance in flower tissues exposed to elevated , analysis of the expression profiles of the putative mmp genes in soybean using rna-seq atlas  found that these genes were not present, or present in low abundance in other soybean tissues. therefore, it is hypothesized that the increase in abundance of the putative mmp genes identified in this study may represent a distinct flower response to o <dig> stress in soybean.

in pod tissue, cell wall modification and calcium signaling genes showed the greatest increase in abundance in response to elevated  . gene ontology  enrichment analysis of biological processes was performed for genes differentially expressed only in pod tissue. apoptosis, signal transduction, atp biosynthetic processes, cellular glucan metabolic processes, protein amino acid phosphorylation and innate immune responses were enriched in pod tissue . these activities are known to increase in plants in response to both abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> , and the possibility that o <dig> stress co-opts pathways involved in biotic stress response has been previously proposed  <cit> . the genes with the greatest increase in abundance in response to elevated  were xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase family proteins  . genes annotated as xths also had high mean expression, along with the greatest increase in abundance in response to o <dig> in pod tissue . these genes belong to the go biological process of cellular glucan metabolic processes, which is highly enriched in pod tissues . analysis of the putative xth genes in soybean using rna-seq atlas  showed that these genes were not present or in low abundance in other tissues, indicating that these genes may represent a distinct pod response to elevated .table  <dig>

xth is a well-known cell wall-modifying enzyme that plays a role in growth and differentiation in plants  <cit> . genes in the xth family are involved in cell elongation in vascular cells  <cit> , epidermal cells  <cit> , inflorescence apices  <cit> , primary roots  <cit>  and during somatic embryogenesis  <cit> . xth also plays a role in floral organ abscission  <cit> . due to the similarity of flower abscission and pod dehiscence zone  <cit>  and the known response of xth genes to oxidative  <cit> , water  <cit>  and biotic stress  <cit> , it is hypothesized that xth genes may play a role in pod dehiscence in soybean exposed to elevated .

CONCLUSIONS
soybean is an o3-sensitive crop, with current tropospheric  costing billions of dollars in lost production annually. in this study, it was established that gene expression in reproductive tissues in soybean is altered by elevated . there were  <dig>  transcripts responsive to elevated  in both flower and pod tissues, yet those genes did not respond consistently in the two tissues. this indicates that reproductive tissues have more distinct than similar transcriptomic responses to elevated . flower tissues responded to elevated  through increased expression of mmp genes. it was notable that these flower mmp genes may not be proteolytically active based on amino acid composition, but they clearly respond to o <dig> stress. pod tissues responded to elevated  through increased expression of cell expansion genes. the increased transcript abundance of xth genes supports a role of these genes in pod dehiscence in soybean exposed to elevated .
