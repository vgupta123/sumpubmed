BACKGROUND
human embryonic stem cells  are pluripotent cells isolated from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst  <cit> . they can be maintained for prolonged periods in culture and differentiate to representatives of the three germ layers as well as trophoblasts and germ cells. this differentiation potential may be used to model certain aspects of human embryogenesis, including the development and differentiation of pluripotent and other stem cell types during the processes of gastrulation, neurogenesis and organogenesis. thus, hescs provide a unique and powerful system to study otherwise intractable aspects of human development. furthermore, these approaches have the potential to provide differentiated cell types for cell replacement therapies of degenerative disorders such as parkinson's disease and type i diabetes  <cit> . before these cell therapy applications are developed, an understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive self-renewal and differentiation is required. fundamental to this understanding is the elucidation of the transcriptome and proteome of hescs, using approaches that lay a framework for functional analyses of the unique properties of these cells.

large-scale gene expression analyses such as microarray, massive parallel signature sequencing , expressed sequenced tag  enumeration, and serial analysis of gene expression  have been used to compare multiple hesc lines  <cit> ; hescs to germ cell tumors  <cit> ; or to differentiated derivatives in embryoid bodies  <cit>  or neural populations  <cit> . these approaches have highlighted an expanded set of transcripts that mark the pluripotent state  <cit> , cross-species commonalities in the molecular profile of escs  <cit> , prominent receptors expressed by hescs  <cit>  and pathways that may play a role in the regulation of pluripotency  <cit> . nevertheless, cataloguing the cellular transcriptome is only predictive of protein expression and typically does not shed light on post-transcriptional regulation. for example, while tens of thousands of transcripts can be followed simultaneously with sage, microarrays and mpss, these methods do not routinely detect differences in transcript splice variants, or polyadenylation status. these differences may have profound effects on translation, as well as the isoform and function of the protein produced. finally, numerous post-translational modifications are known to regulate protein function, including enzymatic cleavage, covalent coupling to other molecules, glycosylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. these issues all highlight potential shortfalls in our understanding of the hesc proteome.

several practical approaches for proteomic analyses are currently available, the most established of which is the 2-dimensional  separation of proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . hplc-tandem mass spectrometry  based technology is rapidly evolving and has recently been used to detect protein expression in multiple cell types. an alternate approach is the recent large-scale adaptation of standard western blotting  <cit> . in this procedure, a large well is used to separate the sample by page and lanes are created on the membrane containing immobilized protein with the use of a manifold. compatible combinations of primary antibodies are predetermined, with the criterion of being able to identify proteins that do not co-migrate. different combinations of primary antibodies are added to each well, with appropriate dilutions of each primary antibody so that expressed proteins are detected in a single condition. the scalability of the system depends on defining suitable combinations of primary antibodies, with up to  <dig> antibodies in  <dig> lanes being used in the largest screens thus far. detection software is used to identify proteins based on their expected and observed gel mobility. unlike 2d page and hplc-ms/ms, large-scale western blotting only identifies proteins for which antibodies are already available. while this is not an appropriate screen for identifying uncharacterized proteins, it greatly simplifies the verification and functional analyses of proteins that are detected. in addition, this approach is highly flexible, and if desired can be focused to particular sets of proteins or protein function, such as cell signaling molecules. importantly, the foundation of this approach is the large amount of data on individual antibodies, which are already available and characterized in the literature.

more recently, two research groups have conducted proteomic analyses of hescs using ms  <cit> . in the present study, we used two large-scale western blot systems to examine the expression of >  <dig> proteins in hescs and detected >  <dig> proteins that were grouped into  <dig> functional classes. in addition, we identified  <dig> examples of multiple bands for a single protein, likely to be protein isoforms and/or post-translational modifications, and  <dig> phosphorylation events in cell signaling molecules. we correlated the expression of members of key active pathways in our transcriptional and proteomic databases and confirmed the validity of this approach. using these approaches we identified new markers for undifferentiated hescs and highlighted unrecognized epithelial characteristics of hescs. our data confirm the importance of proteomic analyses in complementing transcriptional profiling and provide a framework for continued analyses of the molecular and cellular biology of pluirpotent hescs.

RESULTS
powerblot analysis of hescs
we first employed a large-scale western blot screen, the powerblot system, to profile protein expression in undifferentiated hescs. this system used  <dig> antibodies toward proteins representing  <dig> diverse classes of function, such as transcription factors, the map kinase  pathway, and apoptosis, among others. to expand a large-scale culture of bg <dig> cells for this assay, a collagenase- and trypsin- based passaging method was used  <cit> . while these conditions have been associated with the accumulation of trisomies of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and x  <cit> , the ease of use of these cultures and similarity in gene expression and differentiation potential to karyotypically normal bg <dig> hescs  <cit>  make them suitable for such large scale applications. for the powerblot screen, whole cell lysate from bg <dig> hescs was separated on five 4–15% gradient gels. each blot contained size markers and  <dig> lanes. each lane was screened with 1– <dig> antibodies in combinations that had been predetermined to enable accurate identification of well-separated proteins . the gels and blots were performed in duplicate and expressed proteins were identified by their predicted size and verified by visual inspection.

a total of  <dig> antibodies detected bands of appropriate size, which could be compressed to  <dig> proteins with unique swissprot identification numbers . an enlargement of a representative lane  alongside protein markers is shown in fig. 1f. thirteen proteins including akt, caveolin <dig> and erk <dig> were detected in multiple lanes using the same or different antibodies. information on the antibody catalogue number and dilution, band intensity for each repeat and the averaged value, description of protein function, and entrez gene and swissprot database identification numbers is shown in additional file  <dig>  three hundred and eighty three antibodies did not detect bands in this screen, indicating lack of expression, or possibly technical issues with detection under standard conditions .

the size of the detected proteins ranged from  <dig> kd  to  <dig> kd . the average intensity of the detected proteins ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> normalized intensity units , with an average of  <dig> i.u. the proteins with the highest band intensity were the b <dig> bradykinin receptor , karyopherin α , and bip , whilst the proteins with the lowest intensity that could be verified by visual inspection were inhibitor  <dig> , caspase  <dig> , and oxa1hs . finally, the consistency of this assay was demonstrated by plotting the normalized average intensity values for each protein, which revealed a linear relationship between the duplicate samples .

kinexus analysis of hescs
a more focused screen was used to profile expression of protein kinases, phosphatases and phosphorylated sites in cell signaling molecules in hescs. the kinexus assays contained  <dig> antibodies to these related classes of proteins and phospho-sites. karyotypically normal bg <dig> hescs grown on a fibronectin matrix in mef-cm  <cit>  were used for this analysis, and whole cell lysate was separated on four  <dig> % gels for western blotting. eighty five immunoreactive bands were identified, representing  <dig> protein kinases and  <dig> phosphatases, their isoforms, and  <dig> phosphorylated sites in signaling molecules . sixty-four antibodies did not detect their corresponding antigen .

functional classification of proteins expressed in hescs
the powerblot and kinexus assays identified a diverse range of proteins expressed in hescs. to further annotate these data, the detected proteins were ordered into  <dig> subgroups based on protein function . for example,  <dig> factors with known or implied roles in the regulation of self-renewal or pluripotency of mescs or hescs, such as oct <dig>  <cit> , stat <dig>  <cit> , members of the fgf  <cit> , pi <dig> kinase  <cit> , src  <cit>  or mapk pathways  <cit> , and phosphorylated isoforms of gsk <dig>  stat <dig> and p <dig> mapk, were grouped under "pluripotency" . another functional group  consisted of  <dig> transmembrane or cell surface proteins . this included several receptors for peptides and growth factors, such as neurotensin receptor  <dig>  the b <dig> bradykinin, endothelin  <dig>  and thrombin receptors, and the glial derived neurotrophic factor receptor α . these molecules may be useful as targets for cell sorting experiments, and expression of these receptors could identify bioactive peptides or growth factors that may influence hesc self-renewal or differentiation.

other functional classification of the proteins detected by the powerblot screen included: transcription factors , nucleus and nuclear transport , cytoskeleton , cell adhesion , map kinase pathway , protein kinase a , protein kinase c , tyrosine kinases , adaptors and tyrosine kinase substrates , protein phosphatases , gtpases and regulators , calcium signaling , cell cycle , apoptosis , membrane research , and other functions  . some proteins were included in multiple functional categories due to overlapping properties, such as aim- <dig>  which was included in the cell cycle as well as in the nucleus/nuclear transport categories. the kinexus expression data was organized separately into cell signaling-related functional groups . in addition,  <dig> proteins were detected by both the powerblot and kinexus systems .

detection of protein isoforms or post-translational variants
unlike many cdna-based gene expression assays, western blotting has the capacity to detect multiple protein isoforms due to translation of different mrna splice variants, as well as post-translational modifications such as enzymatic cleavage, glycosylation, or phosphorylation. examination of the blots described here identified  <dig> examples of multiple banding for a single target antigen . these candidates exhibited closely migrating multiple bands, which were close to their predicted size but were sufficiently separated from other proteins. for example, four closely migrating bands were observed for fgf <dig> , which may represent known glycosylation variants of this growth factor  <cit> . other known examples of post-translational modifications included those of hsp <dig>  ikkgamma and erk <dig> 

verification of protein expression by immunocytochemistry
the powerblot and kinexus assays identified proteins based on their expected and observed molecular weight, using combinations of antibodies that had been predetermined to detect proteins of sufficiently different sizes. proteins known to be expressed by hescs and also identified by these assays, included oct <dig>  e-cad, connexin  <dig> and hsp <dig>  to verify expression using a complementary approach, we performed immunoflurorescent staining for  <dig> proteins not previously reported to be expressed in hescs by immunocytochemistry, using karyotypically normal bg <dig> cultures . these included abp- <dig>  a homodimeric actin-binding protein often associated with membrane glycoproteins; ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig>  two c terminal binding proteins that are a class of transcription corepressors; gs- <dig>  a golgi protein; hdj- <dig>  a member of the dnaj-related hsp <dig>  subfamily; l-caldesmon, a cytoplasmic actin-binding protein; rabaptin, a gtp-binding protein; phosphorylated-p <dig> cas, a docking protein with an amino-terminal sh <dig> domain that may function as a molecular switch that regulates cas  tyrosine phosphorylation; ras-gap and phosphorylated ras-gap , a protein that down-regulates the signal transducer p21ras; and shcc, a protein with an n-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain. these proteins were all expressed by hescs, with the expected subcellular localization . oct <dig> was used as a positive control . these results suggested that most of the bands in the powerblot and kinexus assays were likely to be correctly identified.

preliminary analyses also indicated that expression of some of these proteins was downregulated in differentiated cells, including p <dig> cas and the traf2- and nck-interacting kinase . tnik is known to be involved in the inhibition of cell spreading via disruption of f-actin  <cit> . immunofluorescence was used to examine the expression of tnik and p <dig> cas during early differentiation of hescs. bg <dig> cultures were partially differentiated by growth in serum containing media for  <dig> days. this condition generated heterogeneous populations containing oct4+ cells with characteristic hesc morphology and less tightly packed, and morphologically differentiated areas, lacking expression of oct <dig> . tnik was expressed highly in undifferentiated hescs, and in the undifferentiated areas at day  <dig>  but was downregulated in areas undergoing morphological differentiation . this may indicate that tnik is active in hescs and degraded rapidly upon differentiation. p <dig> cas was detected in a membrane/peripheral-cytoplasmic pattern in hescs . the distribution of p130cas was substantially altered in differentiating cells with a flattened morphology, exhibiting a general cytoplasmic, or perinuclear profile . this could indicate an alteration in the function of p <dig> cas as pluripotent cells differentiate. these analyses suggested that the change in expression or distribution of these proteins could be used as markers for undifferentiated hescs.

comparison of proteomic and transcriptional profiles of hescs
we have previously employed the illumina bead array system for the large-scale profiling of gene expression in hescs using  <dig>  transcript probes  <cit> . to compare proteomic and transcriptional analyses of hescs, the levels of >  <dig> proteins detected using large scale blotting were correlated with the levels of transcripts detected with the illumina platform . in general, a close match between the expression level of transcript and protein was observed: transcripts for nearly all the detected proteins were also identified in the illumina analysis, and most proteins expressed at high levels also exhibited high mrna levels.

we reasoned that a focused comparison of specific signaling pathways using a combination of proteomic and transcriptional data was likely to be much more informative than a global interrogation of hescs. several major signal pathways that have been suggested to be involved in self-renewal were examined to test this approach. these included the fgf, tgfβ, gsk3β/wnt/β-catenin and jak/stat pathways  <cit> , as well as the more recently suggested mapk/erk and gap junction pathways  <cit> . correlating transcriptional and proteomic data provided direct confirmation that these pathways were present and likely functional in hescs . for example, fgf <dig> protein was expressed highly in hescs and expression of key members of the tgfβ, wnt, jak/stat and gap junction pathways, namely stat <dig>  smads, gsk3β, β-catenin and connexin  <dig>  were detected in both transcriptional and proteomic databases.

protein expression level: >  <dig> : ++++;  <dig> – <dig> : +++;  <dig> – <dig> :++; 100– <dig> : + mrna gene expression level: >  <dig> :++++;  <dig> – <dig> : +++; 100– <dig> : ++; 30–100: +

this independent confirmation of known networks led us to examine other pathways that showed a similar correlation but have not been identified as key regulators of either self-renewal or differentiation, or suggest unappreciated characteristics of hescs. four signaling pathways  and the tight junction complex were highlighted by this analysis , and expression of key proteins in these pathways was confirmed. a detailed study demonstrating the importance of the igf and erbb <dig> pathways in hesc self-renewal has been performed and enabled the development of a defined medium for hesc maintenance . tight junctions are apical cell-cell junctions found in epithelia that establish a barrier to the extracellular environment and a border for apical-basolateral polarity. while hescs grow in colonies that are highly reminiscent of epithelia, and have been shown to be coupled by gap junctions  <cit> , the formation of tight junction complexes has not been described. hescs expressed the zo <dig> and occludin tight junction proteins along cell borders as expected in polarized epithelia. the distribution of zo <dig> expression changed dramatically as hescs proliferated in culture. when tight junction complexes were disrupted by disaggreagation to single cells, only a subset of cells showed zo <dig> staining  <dig> days after plating . continued proliferation to a confluent monolayer on day  <dig> was accompanied by widespread expression of zo <dig>  suggesting the formation of a general tight junction barrier. these cultures were undifferentiated and retained uniform expression of oct <dig> protein . erbb <dig> and  <dig> are members of the epidermal growth factor -receptor family, which regulate epithelial proliferation via egf-family ligands. erbb <dig> and  <dig> transcripts are expressed by hescs  <cit> , are known to function as a heterodimer  <cit> , and transmit a strong proliferative signal for hescs by heregulin 1β  . immunofluorescence revealed general cell surface expression of erbb <dig> on hescs. conversely, erbb <dig> was highly localized to a concentrated area, and observed in cells that also expressed zo <dig>  epithelial cells are known to localize erbb receptors to the basolateral side of tight junctions, which serves to functionally separate receptors from ligands  <cit> . this is a basic epithelial wound healing mechanism, whereby disruption of the tight junction barrier by injury immediately exposes receptors to extracelluar ligands  <cit> . these staining patterns are also suggestive of basolateral sorting of erbb <dig> in hescs. the pathways and complexes identified by these analyses lay a framework for future functional analyses of signaling networks in hescs.

discussion
attempts to harness the potential of hescs for models of human embryogenesis and cell therapy applications will be greatly enhanced by a detailed understanding of their molecular characteristics. this includes definition of the transcripts, splice variants, and protein isoforms expressed by these cells. post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, and the receptors and signaling pathways active in the pluripotent state, or during early differentiation, also need to be determined. this should also be complemented by an understanding of epigenetic characteristics of pluripotency, including methylation, imprinting and chromatin conformation. such a comprehensive definition of the molecular state of hescs will enable more accurate prediction and testing of the conditions used for growth and differentiation of hescs, by precise genetic modification or application of specific growth factor cocktails and reagents. for example, a scalable, fully defined and gmp-certified culture system will need to be developed for the eventual development of hesc-based cellular therapies. progress has been made in defining growth factor conditions that support self-renewal  <cit> , and hesc lines have been isolated in the absence of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in animal protein free culture conditions  <cit> . a more refined understanding of the biology of hescs has contributed the development of a defined medium utilizing ligands for igf1r and erbb2/ <dig> receptors to promote in self-renewal .

we and others have performed transcriptional analyses of hescs, using cdna and oligonucleotide microarrays, sage, mpss and est enumeration. these techniques have enabled the collation and comparison of transcriptional profiles from multiple hesc lines and their differentiated derivatives and have highlighted an expanded set of hesc specific markers and signaling pathways that may regulate self-renewal or differentiation. using pathway analysis we were also able to identify key pathways that are active in escs . while these efforts have been highly valuable in defining the transcriptional profile of undifferentiated hescs, they are only predictive of translation and do not shed light on post-translational events in this unique cell type. these processes may also be highly regulated, which could contribute significantly to the overall conversion of genetic information to actual protein function.

we report here a proteomic analysis of pluripotent hescs by using two large-scale western blotting systems and highlight post-translational events in undifferentiated hescs. the expression of  <dig> bands was detected, potentially representing  <dig> proteins, or their migratory isoforms. in addition, one hundred and forty phospho-specific antibodies were used to identify  <dig> different phosphorylated sites, on  <dig> proteins in these cells. the detected proteins were annotated into functional classes representing diverse cellular processes. for example, multiple proteins were detected that have been suggested to regulate the pluirpotent state in mouse escs or hescs. defining the interplay of these multiple signaling pathways will be critical in understanding the self-renewal versus differentiation decisions of hescs. therefore, our data provide a powerful framework for the functional analysis of specific proteins, protein classes, or molecular pathways. in particular, the availability of antibodies for candidate proteins is a major benefit of this approach compared to 2d-gel or hplc-ms/ms based proteomics.

although these western blotting approaches are currently more limited in scope than most large-scale cdna based assays, detecting up to  <dig> proteins compared to tens of thousands of transcripts, they have the potential to highlight translational events and post-translational modifications. by comparison, sage and mpss are limited to detecting short sequence "tags" adjacent to the poly-a tail of transcripts, and may not distinguish splice variants with the same 3' exon. we detected  <dig> proteins with multiple closely migrating bands , suggestive of closely related isoforms or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. these focused proteomic approaches are therefore likely to be highly complimentary to transcriptional analyses in investigating the functional expression of the genome in hescs and during cellular differentiation.

one potential issue with this approach is that multiple antibodies are included in each lane, which could possibly lead to misidentification of bands. to demonstrate that identified proteins were expressed in hescs, the same antibodies used in the powerblot assay were used to confirm expression of  <dig> representative proteins by immunofluorescence . furthermore,  <dig> proteins were detected with multiple different antibodies, and  <dig> proteins  were detected in both the powerblot and kinexus assays. this provided internal, or independent, confirmation of expression of these proteins. other studies have also demonstrated the expression of several of the proteins we detected in hescs. these include oct <dig>  a key marker of the pluripotent state, connexin  <dig> and gsk3β, confirming the reliability of large-scale western blotting. finally, several proteins detected by our assays were also detected in hescs by ms approaches including karyopherin α  <cit> .

additionally, the powerblot assay was performed in duplicate, and was shown to be highly reproducible. this suggested that this approach should be informative when comparing hescs to their differentiated derivatives. two candidate proteins, tnik and p <dig> cas, were downregulated, or exhibited altered localization upon spontaneous differentiation of hescs, respectively. this indicated that they were novel markers of undifferentiated cells and molecules that could be functionally involved with self-renewal.

it is impossible in an initial manuscript to analyze and rigorously test all the predictions that could be made from comparing transcriptional and proteomic data sets. however, we did examine key features to illustrate the power of this methodology. potential new markers for hescs were identified, the expression and activation of proteins in key self-renewal pathways were confirmed, and a diverse range of proteins were detected and expression correlated with transcriptional analyses. in addition, we highlighted several candidate signaling pathways that may be relevant to self-renewal. examination of tight junction protein expression indicated that undifferentiated hescs could form polarized epithelia, which has also been recently suggested by ultrastructural analyses  <cit> . discrete localization of erbb <dig> may also suggest basolateral separation of this receptor from soluble ligand. these analyses highlight that predictions from a combination of transcriptional and proteomic approaches will serve to focus the investigation of hescs in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we generated a focused proteome of hescs using large-scale western blotting and sorted the detected proteins according to function and signaling pathways. this characterization provides important basic information on expressed proteins, their isoforms and post-translational modifications, and tools for the continued investigation of the underlying molecular characteristics of hescs. importantly, we provide a list of tools, in the form of commercially available antibodies, which can be used to interrogate the function of these molecules in self-renewal or differentiation.
