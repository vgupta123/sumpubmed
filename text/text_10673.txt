BACKGROUND
the recurrence of poultry outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the h5n <dig> subtype  in some parts of the world, and the occasional spillover of infection to humans, is a significant global health concern. poultry rearing is an important enterprise in countries across the greater mekong region. in vietnam, poultry rearing is closely linked with people's livelihoods and traditional culture  <cit> .

five epidemic waves of hpai h5n <dig> occurred in vietnam between late  <dig> and mid- <dig>  causing the second highest human case incidence and case-fatality rates in the world. the proximity of poultry flocks to water courses and paddy fields, and keeping of other poultry species all have an important role in sustaining and perpetuating infection  <cit> . poultry outbreaks are primarily reported in the red and mekong river deltas, and the majority of outbreaks are recorded in the predominant small-holder chicken and duck flocks. agro-ecological factors related to poultry husbandry, trade and social-cultural customs are suggested to be associated with the maintenance of the hpai h5n <dig> infection cycle in vietnam  <cit> . the daily outbreak incidence during the first two epidemic waves  peaked around the annual "tet" holiday festivities in february, when poultry movement is increased  <cit> . however, the temporal distribution of h5n <dig> outbreaks has changed since the introduction of vaccination in  <dig>  and since mid- <dig> reported outbreaks have not shown a regular pattern  <cit> .

in both human and animal populations, the structure of contact between individuals contributes to the incursion and spread of contagious diseases  <cit> . in the case of avian influenza, the movement of live birds is a risk factor for the dissemination of the virus to poultry flocks  <cit> . in particular, live bird markets have long been considered to be an important link in the pathways that lead to the emergence and reintroduction of infection. these markets facilitate the congregation of large populations of animals- that have originated from a diversity of sources in a fairly large geographical area -- in relatively small spaces  <cit> . this becomes particularly noteworthy as avian influenza surveillance studies in the united states and in southeast  asia have provided evidence of presence of virus lineages in live bird markets  <cit> . similarly, a virological survey in ten live bird markets in ha noi has shown that the hpai h5n <dig> virus was already circulating in healthy geese as early as  <dig>  <cit> . also, evidence suggests that live bird markets can be suitable environments for potential virus re-assortment and transmission  <cit> . the viruses found in  <dig> in ha noi's live bird markets have been reported to be genetically related to virus isolated in hong kong in  <dig>  but are genetically distinct from those isolated in northern vietnam in early  <dig>  <cit> . this supports the hypothesis that separate virus introductions via trade of live poultry might be responsible for different outbreak periods. this is further supported by a recent molecular study of hpai h5n <dig> viruses that suggested that outbreaks in the north of vietnam are likely to be attributable to multiple introductions of virus primarily through transboundary trade with southern china  <cit> .

factors such as  culturally-driven seasonal patterns of poultry demand and  the close inter-linkage of poultry production with other seasonal agricultural activities  and disease control interventions are expected to influence the production levels of different species and therefore their marketing patterns  <cit> . in relation to disease control, policies applied during the outbreak waves included movement restrictions, restrictions to breeding of certain poultry, and market bans that were fundamentally similar to the ones applied in hong kong lbm's after  <dig>  <cit> . the intended effect of restrictions to live poultry trade was to reduce the exposure of humans at markets, market contamination and opportunities for virus recombination  <cit> .

to date, the relationship between small-holder poultry production and trade, and in particular, between small-scale poultry holders, poultry traders and live bird markets has been insufficiently studied and documented in hpai h5n1-affected se asian countries. this information is difficult to obtain but is essential for understanding outbreak recurrence associated with poultry trade. the available information for vietnam does not provide substantive evidence on the association between production and trade in smallholder poultry and its role on outbreak occurrence. the objective of the present study is to better understand the flow of live poultry, as investigated in a poultry trade network of northern vietnam, and explore its potential role in the risk for hpai h5n <dig> introduction and spread and the resulting implications for disease control policies.

RESULTS
relationship between trade attributes of lpt's
the characteristics of lpt's are presented in table  <dig>  the lpt's that sell and buy poultry on the same day often leave the lbm and distribute poultry to several destinations other than slaughter; this trade type is performed by individuals more experienced in poultry trade. the number of communes visited by lpt's was not large  nor was the number of contact flocks in them . the communes included in the current study have significantly larger numbers of flocks and smaller commune areas when compared to other areas in the country . the distances from commune to lbm were generally quite short , except for ha vi and bac tan long markets. our results also suggest that more experienced lpt's tend to trade in retail markets  and that lpt's operating at wholesale markets tend to contact larger flocks  and trade more poultry than those operating at retail markets . the frequencies of the number of poultry traded do not differ by species of poultry  but the chicken flocks contacted by lpt's tend to have large numbers of poultry than duck and muscovy duck flocks .

trade behaviour of lpt's and occurrence of hpai outbreaks
a total of 43%  communes with complete trade information  had recorded hpai outbreaks in poultry from  <dig> through to  <dig>  there were only two positive communes in 2005- <dig> out of the  <dig> with disease data.

the results of the univariable and multivariable analysis of lpt attributes associated with hpai outbreaks during  <dig> to  <dig> are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. none of the tested biologically plausible first-order interactions resulted in improvement of model fit. the goodness-of-fit test showed a suboptimal fitness of the model . the potential impact of clustering of data due to multiple measurements from each lpt resulted in an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of  <dig>  .

networks of poultry trade and occurrence of hpai outbreaks trader-commune network 
the geographical distribution of the communes included in the analysis of associations with commune infection status is shown in figure  <dig>  the 2-mode trader-commune network contains  <dig> nodes of which  <dig> are in the commune class and  <dig> in the lpt class, located in the following lbm's: bac thang long, cho ni, cho phu lo, cho to, da ton, ha vi, sui, and yen thuong. there were  <dig> flocks identified by lpt's in the set of communes; the average number of traded flocks is  <dig>  per commune  and  <dig>  per lpt . there are  <dig> links between nodes and the density of the network is  <dig> %. on average  <dig>  traders operate per commune . lpt's trade on average in  <dig>  communes . the network is very fragmented with  <dig> components, but there is a highly connected core of communes, consisting of a giant weak component and a sparse periphery . the giant component includes  <dig> nodes  linking  <dig> communes and  <dig> traders, the second component includes  <dig> nodes ,  <dig> communes and  <dig> traders and the other  <dig> components have  <dig> or less nodes with  <dig> components of five or less nodes.

commune-commune networks 
this network is as equally fragmented as network  <dig>  consisting of  <dig> components; the locations of the communes in the two main components are shown in figure  <dig> 

the symmetric binary 1-mode commune network includes  <dig> nodes, has  <dig> % density and  <dig> links. the average degree is  <dig>   so that an average commune is connected to more than three other communes via common lpt's. the giant weak component includes  <dig> nodes , and a second component has  <dig> nodes . the remaining  <dig> components have  <dig> or less nodes with  <dig> components of five or less nodes. network  <dig> contains  <dig> cliques:  <dig> 3-cliques,  <dig> 4-cliques,  <dig> 5-cliques,  <dig> 6-clique and  <dig> 8-clique.

the clique overlap network  contains the same number of communes,  <dig>  with a density of  <dig> % and  <dig> links. the average number of communes that share a clique with any other is  <dig>  .

applying significance tests to the subset of communes with attribute data, there was no significant difference in the mean degree of the nodes of network  <dig> and  <dig> between the ones infected during at least one of the epidemic waves or in any single one . the test of autocorrelation for network  <dig> and  <dig> showed that the proportion of links between infected and non-infected communes  is significantly lower than expected for the variable "infected 2003-2006" . the number of type  <dig> and  <dig> links was not significantly different for the same variable . being a member of the giant component in network  <dig> is significantly associated with not having been infected in any wave .

lbm-commune network 
the geographical location of the catchment areas of each lbm is presented in figure  <dig>  there are five communes linked to more than one lbm: two linked to ha vi and bac thang long, one linked to ha vi and cho ni and two linked to bac than long and yen thuong and cho to, respectively. these five communes experienced ai outbreaks: three in 2003- <dig>  one in 2004- <dig> and one in 2003- <dig> and 2004- <dig>  this network consists of  <dig> nodes, representing links between  <dig> communes and  <dig> lbm's where the  <dig> lpt's of network  <dig> were located.

in terms of trade volume, the two distinctive types of lbm, wholesale and retail, in network  <dig> determine the network structure with one component linking the two wholesale lbm's and two retail lbm's as well as four isolated components corresponding to the catchment areas of the other four retail lbm's. in ha vi market, poultry from  <dig> flocks in  <dig> communes were traded mainly in the south of ha noi and scattered communes north of the capital, whereas in bac thang long market poultry from  <dig> flocks in  <dig> communes were traded in a small area north of ha noi . the other six retail markets are local with small catchment areas in terms of number of flocks  and communes .

discussion
to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first investigation of the association between poultry trade and hpai outbreaks in northern vietnam. the results of this study highlight the advantage of combining a descriptive study with a network analysis of the characteristics of the poultry trade pattern of lpt's, and demonstrate that this methodology can improve our understanding of the epidemiology of hpai h5n <dig> in affected countries. although trade is usually difficult to quantify, the network analysis provided insight into the relational nature of the live poultry trade and its potential relationship with the spread and maintenance of ai in northern vietnam.

this study supports previous research findings indicating that lbm's may constitute an important source of infection for poultry  <cit> . in particular, our analyses indicate that new lpt's  and those operating in authorised retail lbm's have increased odds of sourcing poultry from flocks located in communes with past history of h5n <dig> outbreaks during  <dig> to  <dig>  when compared to older lpt's  and to those operating in wholesale markets. this suggests that individuals who are relatively new to the poultry trading business are more likely to operate in areas with previous infection history, perhaps due to their inexperience. it is also possible that experienced traders consciously avoid high disease risk areas, thereby providing new traders with an opportunity to set up their business in these areas. although this finding does not allow inferences in relation to the source of the outbreaks amongst infected communes, it provides evidence for advocating modifiable practices directed towards new traders at retail markets. these could include the dissemination of historical and up-to-date information on the geographical distribution of outbreaks and the development of more biosecure poultry trading practices such as crate cleaning and disinfection.

further, while it is a legal requirement that traders visiting an lbm for the purpose of selling poultry report to the market inspectors  at the lbm's veterinary check point, those that leave the lbm with poultry are currently not required to report. as identified in our study, poultry are in some occasions introduced back to other flocks which present a risk for further virus transmission. we recommend that at the market-level, this type of poultry trade should be discouraged, or at least monitored by mis. the implementation of a poultry traceability scheme would provide a mechanism for monitoring and regulating the traffic of live poultry in and out of the lbm's.

the links between specific communes in northern vietnam were described using social network analysis. the lpt-commune network and the commune-commune networks showed low density of links and a typical core-periphery structure. while the presence of low density of links is beneficial from a disease control point of view, the presence of a highly connected core may pose considerable challenges for the geographical containment of disease when infected birds flow through these trade channels. furthermore, we found that increasing numbers of lpt's operating in communes does not increase the risk of ai outbreaks during the period 2003- <dig> nor does being linked to many other communes via the same lpt's. although centrality measures at node level  have been suggested to be of practical use in the development of effective targeted disease control strategies  <cit> , the investigation of the links within and between subgroups of nodes has provided better insight into the relationship between the disease status and network structure. the randomly permuted networks indicate that the observed number of links between communes of similar disease status is higher than the random distribution of links between communes, whereas the observed number of links between infected and non-infected communes is lower than expected. these results suggest that there is a separation in terms of the lpt's trading between infected and non-infected communes. since in our network analysis the links between communes are defined by trading events of lpt's, these results indicate that the observed outbreak pattern in 2003- <dig> appeared to be associated to subgroups of lpt's, with communes linked by them having the same disease status. this finding was also supported by the analysis of the clique-overlap membership matrix.

the lbm-commune network showed that only a few communes  traded poultry in both retail and wholesale markets. nevertheless, all of these communes experienced ai outbreaks during  <dig> to  <dig>  in contrast to  <dig> % infection level amongst the other communes . in addition, the travel distances from communes linked to retail markets are quite short compared to those linked to wholesale markets. this is consistent with the local emphasis of trade, where most of the lpt's in retail markets transport poultry in motorcycles fitted with baskets. evidence from other livestock diseases suggests that fast long-range dissemination of infectious diseases can occur through live animal trade at large livestock markets  <cit> . our descriptive analysis has shown that lpt's operating in wholesale markets tend to contact larger flocks and trade more poultry than those operating in retail markets. lpt's in wholesale markets generally travel by motorcycles with fitted crates, vans or lorries that enable larger distances and transport more animals than those operating in retail markets. consequently, large wholesale markets can source and disseminate large quantities of poultry throughout a large area of northern vietnam on the same day, further complicating disease control operations if infection were to flow through these channels. the dispersion of infection over a relatively large geographical space could be assisted by the trade with flocks in the few communes in the giant weak component that are geographically distant from its core.

our results should be interpreted taking account the study's assumptions and limitations. firstly, potential biases may have been introduced during the selection of lbm's and the lpt's. for example, by the time we carried out our surveys, only lbm's in the five outer districts of the capital city were allowed to trade poultry. nevertheless, market selection was based on a history of recurrent hpai h5n <dig> outbreaks, and on regional importance with respect to the magnitude of poultry production and trade within the red river delta. in relation to the lpt's, the "buy only" was underrepresented because individuals leaving the lbm with live poultry do not have to report at the market veterinary check point. secondly, while we conducted our survey during a period when poultry trade and therefore potential outbreak risk were both expected to be at their peak, the trade pattern may vary across seasons and years. also, hpai h5n <dig> disease control measures may change the trade pattern of live birds in and around the affected areas  <cit> . however, it is very difficult to deal with the uncertainty of the contact structure and its stability over time and through ai outbreaks. even if the observed contact structure was different than prior to the ai outbreaks, it would be very difficult to ascertain whether this change was due to the impact of the disease, the control measure or pure changes in the trading behaviour caused by other reasons unaccounted for in this study . only by simulating stochastically alternative network structures the impact of a wider range of outputs on the disease status could have been analyzed. however, there is not a network model that could represent a "standard" contact structure of live poultry trade in this area to which to compare the observed one. thus, the poultry trade networks presented by this study are representative of the time period of peak poultry trade in north vietnam and of the year when the study was conducted. thirdly, our analyses are based on the assumption that the ai risk profile of a given lpt-flock link is associated with the historical infection status of the commune where the flock was located. this relationship is convenient because it enables the use of publicly available disease surveillance data aggregated at commune level. however, assuming that all flocks are a single population at risk could introduce systematic error to the interpretation of results. factors such as commune area size and number of flocks in the communes may have an impact on the validity of this assumption by influencing the geographic dissemination of the virus within a commune. currently in vietnam, disease control policies based on flock depopulation consider village level depopulation as the main control measure for containing local virus dissemination, and thereby make the assumption that flocks in a village are a single population at risk. this decision represents a compromise between the logistic constraints of disease control and the known heterogeneity of poultry flocks among the approximately  <dig>  communes of vietnam. moreover, analysis of population and area data of the communes included in this study, together with the known infectious properties of ai viruses, suggests that poultry flocks within communes may indeed be homogenous with respect to hpaiv h5n <dig> risk. finally, the validity of a social network analysis based on our ego-centric data collection methods may have been influenced by sampling errors and lack of representativeness  <cit> . the statistical analysis could not include all nodes of the networks due to the lack of response of some lpt's and inability to correctly identify some communes named by them. the estimation of the standard errors and significance levels were affected by the fact that there were very few infected communes during the later ai epidemic wave .

taking these limitations into account, the results of this study indicate that the association of some lpt's to specific communes within the catchment area of authorised lbm's may support transmission of ai infection. this is particularly important where inadequate protection conferred by vaccination allows residual infection to remain in communes linked by lpt's of the trade network. these findings may support the need to promote policies encouraging more biosecure practices of lpt's operating through authorised lbm's. these could include a) the dissemination of information with respect to the geographic locations of high outbreak risk communes and b) the implementation of a formal data recording scheme for all incoming and outgoing lpt's. the former could be implemented by providing maps describing areas with previous history of outbreaks, and making them available, for example, at market veterinary checkpoints. data recording systems should include regular data capture by the mis concerning contextual characteristics of contact flocks  and demographic characteristics of the trade . these interventions should be combined with enhanced flock-level biosecurity and disease monitoring and evaluation strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the modification of the lpts' trade patterns. these interventions would have important implications for disease control efforts. at the local level, making disease outbreak information available to lpt's  would enhance their decision-making capacity when selecting geographical areas for trade. in addition, providing mis with a data collection tool would formalise market access and contribute to their empowerment. these benefits would extend to the national-level by promoting enhanced knowledge of disease control operational managers regarding the live poultry trade structure in authorized lbm's.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence which is potentially important for informing policies intended to encourage more biosecure practices of lpt operating at authorised lbm's. our study, which combined descriptive and network analyses, showed that:

• less experienced traders  and those trading in retail markets are more likely to trade with areas with a history of hpai h5n <dig> infection.

• some lpt's introduce poultry to other flocks as part of their normal trade practice.

• larger quantities of poultry are transported from a wider geographical area to wholesale markets when compared to retail markets.

• the association of some lpt's with a limited set of communes within the catchment area of authorised lbm's may support hpai h5n <dig> transmission and may contribute to perpetuating hpai h5n <dig> virus circulation among certain groups of communes.

given the above, current disease prevention and control interventions would benefit from dissemination of information about outbreak risk and the implementation of a formal data recording scheme at lbm's for all incoming and outgoing lpt's.
