BACKGROUND
the myeloid translocation gene  protein family includes three human members: mtg <dig>   <cit> , mtgr <dig>   <cit>  and mtg <dig>   <cit> . the mtg proteins share four conserved domains that can be traced to the drosophila protein nervy, and therefore called nervy homology regions   <cit> . these domains carry information for distinct, but integrated, functional properties. the nhr <dig> domain can positively or negatively modulate transcription through interaction with either co-repressors or transcriptional activators  <cit> . the nhr <dig> domain is required for interaction with other mtg proteins and with the transcriptional co-repressor sin3a  <cit> . the nhr <dig> domain, even if it contains two zinc finger  domains, does not mediate dna-binding  <cit> ; instead, it binds both co-repressor proteins, including n-cor/smrt, and histone deacetylases   <cit> . we and others showed that the mtg proteins can act as chromatin repressors due to their ability to recruit hdac activity, either directly  <cit>  or via the co-repressors n-cor/smrt and sin3a  <cit> . further, it has been demonstrated that both mtg <dig> and mtg <dig> can induce transcriptional repression of reporter genes  <cit> . since the mtg proteins do not bind to dna directly, their transcriptional repressive action is dependent on the binding to transcription factors able to recognize specific target-genes .

as a consequence of the leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations t and t, mtg <dig> and mtg <dig> are fused to aml <dig> , a transcription factor crucial for hematopoiesis. the resulting fusion proteins aml1-mtg <dig>  and aml1-mtg <dig> retain the dna-binding domain of aml <dig>  and all the four functional nhr domains of the mtg proteins . both aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig> can bind to aml1-target genes, recruit hdac activity, and induce a repressed chromatin state  <cit> . in vitro studies suggest that epigenetic downregulation/silencing of these target genes may be a key step in leukemogenesis  <cit> .

more and more evidence has been accumulating that rna, in particular non-coding rna , can play an important role in the epigenetic control of chromatin  <cit> . the mtg proteins are transcriptional regulators equipped with non-dna-binding zf domains, which have been described to mediate protein-rna interactions in other proteins  <cit> . based on this observation, we previously hypothesized that transcriptional regulation by the mtg proteins might involve an rna component  <cit> . to start to address this hypothesis, we set out to investigate whether the mtg proteins have rna-binding properties. by using a well established rna-binding assay based on synthetic rna homopolymers  <cit> , here we show that indeed this is the case. two regions mediate the rna binding: the zinc-finger domains in the nhr <dig> region and a novel rna-binding short basic region  proximal to the nhr <dig> region. we further show that the two oncogenic fusion proteins aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig>  retaining these two regions, maintain also rna-binding properties.

RESULTS
the mtg proteins have rna-binding properties
we investigated the rna-binding properties of mtg <dig>  mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> by analyzing their ability to interact with four synthetic rna homopolymers, poly, poly, poly and poly, coupled to sepharose beads. this method has been previously proven to be suitable for studying rna-binding properties of rna-binding proteins, including the fragile × mental retardation protein fmrp, which we used in this study as a positive control  <cit> . the three mtgs, exogenously expressed in cos cells, display binding to both poly and poly, but no binding to poly and poly, thus showing the same properties of the control rna-binding protein fmrp . all mtgs did not bind uncoupled sepharose beads, indicating specific affinity for rna . for the remainder of this study we chose to use only poly rna. digestion with micrococcal nuclease of the sepharose-conjugated poly homopolymer apparently abolishes mtgs precipitation , demonstrating that the binding occurs via poly rna . in addition, we showed that known non-rna-binding proteins, such as bsa and gfp, were not able to bind poly rna under the experimental conditions used . these indicate that the rna-binding properties of the mtg proteins are specific.

next, we determined the strength of mtgs binding to poly beads in the presence of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl. all mtgs bound the poly homopolymer at the physiological salt concentration of  <dig> mm . the binding was stable up to  <dig> mm nacl, while it weakened at higher salt concentrations , which is not uncommon for other rna-binding proteins  <cit> . the rna-binding strength of the mtg proteins is similar to the one reported for rna-binding proteins that, like the mtgs  <cit> , have multiple functions  <cit> .

finally, we investigated the influence of posttranslational modifications of the mtg proteins on the rna binding. mtg proteins produced in an in vitro transcription/translation system, in which posttranslational modifications do not occur, retained the ability to interact with poly rna . this indicates that posttranslational modifications are not directly necessary for the observed rna binding.

deletion of the zinc-finger domains is not sufficient to abolish rna-binding properties
the nhr <dig>  a region conserved across all the mtgs, contains two zinc finger  domains  <cit> . zf domains are known to have dna-binding properties, but they have been described to mediate also interaction with rna  <cit> . in silico analysis of the mtg <dig> nhr <dig> structure indeed suggests that this region is a putative rna-binding domain. first, we analyzed the primary structure of the nhr <dig> region by using the bindn program  <cit> . this analysis predicted several rna-binding residues between aminoacid  <dig> and  <dig> . further, we analyzed the mtg <dig> nhr <dig> solution structure, previously solved by nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy  <cit>  and deposited in the protein data bank , by using patch finder plus  <cit> . the patch finder plus algorithm extracts from the three-dimensional  protein structure positively charged electrostatic patches, which are known to mediate protein-nucleic-acid interactions. the algorithm predicted on the surface of the nhr <dig> domain a large positive patch , whose amino acid residues partially overlap with the rna-binding residues predicted by the analysis of the nhr <dig> primary structure . because the mtg proteins do not have dna-binding properties  <cit> , it is conceivable to hypothesize that this positive patch mediates protein-rna binding. for this reason, we further tested the predicted rna-binding in vitro, by developing two mtg <dig> deletion mutants either lacking the zf-containing c-terminus  or the n-terminus  . the mtg <dig> epitope recognized by our ab- <dig> antibody  <cit>   allowed the detection of these deletion mutants without using protein tags, which might interfere with the rna-binding. deletion of the mtg <dig> c-terminus  did not affect the binding to poly , thus indicating that rna-binding domains other than the zf might be present. this supposition is further supported by the observation that both mtg <dig> and mtg8Δ <dig> bind to poly even in the absence of zncl <dig> , which would be necessary for a zf-mediated interaction. since deletion of mtg <dig> n-terminus  did not abolish zinc-independent binding to poly , we hypothesized the presence of an additional rna-binding domain common to the two deletion mutants, in the region encompassing a.a. 305– <dig> 

identification of a zinc-independent rna-binding domain proximal to the nhr <dig> region
to search for potential rna-binding domains other than the nhr <dig> in the mtg <dig> protein, we used, in addition to bindn, a second software, rnabindr. rnabindr is a computational tool able to predict rna-binding amino acids from a protein primary sequence, based on interactions from structures of known protein-rna complexes  <cit> . both programs predicted an mtg <dig> region rich in rna-binding residues between a.a.  <dig> and a.a.  <dig> . analysis of the mtg <dig> sequence from other species and other human mtg proteins identified a conserved short basic region  within a.a.  <dig> and a.a.  <dig> . this region has a high content in basic amino acids, which are often involved in nucleic acid binding  <cit> . specifically, the arginines at position  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and other basic residues at position  <dig> and  <dig> are conserved from xenopus to human . since the three-dimensional structure of the sbr is not known, we could not test for the presence of positively charged protein patches. however, we established the rna-binding properties of the sbr in vitro. by deleting the sbr from mtg8Δ <dig>  we obtained the deletion mutant mtg8Δ <dig>  which lacks a.a. 1– <dig>  but retains the zf domains in the c-terminus . mtg8Δ <dig> was able to bind poly only in the presence of zncl <dig> , indicating that the sbr is responsible for the zinc-independent binding to rna. another deletion mutant, mtg8Δ <dig>  missing both the zinc-finger domain and the n-terminal part, including the sbr, did not bind to poly either in the presence or in the absence of zncl <dig> , indicating that the zf domains mediate the zinc-dependent rna-binding. in conclusion, two regions mediate mtg <dig> rna-binding: the canonical zf domains in the nhr <dig> region and a novel zinc-independent rna-binding domain corresponding to the sbr region.

the fusion proteins aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig> retain the rna-binding properties of wild type mtgs
as a consequence of the leukemia-associated chromosome translocations t and t, almost the entire mtg <dig> and mtg <dig> protein moieties are fused to the rhd domain of aml <dig>  leading to the chimeric aml1-mtg <dig> and aml1-mtg <dig> proteins, respectively  <cit> . these chimeric proteins retain the aml <dig> dna-binding domain and all the mtgs functional domains, including the zf and the sbr rna-binding domains . here we show that both fusion proteins bind to poly both in the presence and the absence of zncl <dig> , thus indicating that the rna-binding properties of the wild type mtg proteins are maintained in their chimeric counterparts.

discussion
the mtg proteins are transcriptional regulators capable of networking with their own family protein members and a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins. apparently, the major mtgs' action relies on the ability of these adaptor proteins to establish multiple interactions, on one hand with canonical dna-binding transcription factors and, on the other hand, with chromatin regulatory proteins, including repressor proteins and histone modifying enzymes . the mtgs carry out distinct, but integrated, functional interactions through conserved domains, the nhr1- <dig>  homologous to the drosophila protein nervy. despite the presence of two zinc finger  motifs in one of the domains , the mtg proteins do not exert their transcriptional regulatory function by direct dna binding  <cit> .

based on the observation that zf motifs can mediate not only dna-protein interactions, but also rna-protein interactions  <cit> , we previously hypothesized that the zf-containing nhr <dig> domain could confer rna-binding properties to both wild type and chimeric mtg proteins  <cit> . in this study, by using an in vitro assay based on rna homopolymers binding  <cit> , we show that the mtg proteins specifically bind to rna. we unequivocally demonstrate the binding specificity by performing a series of experiments. first, we showed that non-rna-binding proteins cannot be precipitated by rna hompolymers under the same conditions used for the mtgs. second, digestion of the poly rna homopolymer completely abolished the mtgs binding. finally, the mtg-rna interaction was abrogated by deletion of specific mtg domains. by combining in silico protein analyses and development of mtg deletion mutants, we found that the rna binding is not only mediated by the zf domains in the nhr <dig> region, but entails also a novel, zinc-independent, rna-binding region proximal to nhr <dig>  the sbr region. the sbr domain seems to be highly conserved across the three human mtgs and the mtgs of different species, and it is rich in basic amino acid residues, a feature frequently observed in rna binding domains  <cit> . to our knowledge, this region is a bona fide novel rna binding domain, whose primary and secondary structures do not resemble canonical rna-binding domains  <cit> .

the aberrant aml1-mtg fusion proteins retain the ability of interplaying with both repressor proteins and/or histone modifying enzymes, and can induce an altered epigenetic status at the chromatin of both coding and non-coding aml1-target genes  <cit> . apparently, the fusion of two mtgs, mtg <dig> and mtg <dig>  to the rhd region of aml <dig> does not affect the in vitro rna-binding properties.

whether the wild type and chimeric mtg proteins bind rna in vivo remains to be established. the mtg proteins, like the well-known rna-binding protein fmrp  <cit> , bind preferentially to poly and poly. this might suggest a potential affinity for rnas rich in u and/or g, such as mrnas containing short tandem repeats  made of gu dinucleotides  <cit>  or long poly stretches  in their 3'untranslated region . further, based on the strength of rna binding, the mtg proteins might mediate transient protein-rna interactions. it is noteworthy that transient rna-protein interactions often characterize multifunctional proteins, such as chaperone proteins, with rna-binding strengths similar to the ones displayed by the mtgs  <cit> .

interestingly, the two domains that we found to be involved in rna binding in either a zinc-dependent or a zinc-independent fashion are also capable of interacting with specific chromatin regulatory proteins. specifically, the zf-containing nhr <dig> domain is known to interact with both the n-cor/smrt proteins and hdacs  <cit> , while the sbr domain is overlapping with a region  involved in hdac <dig> binding  <cit> . whether an rna component initiates, or contributes, to the assembly of mtgs-containing repressor complexes at specific target sites in the genome remains to be established. a growing number of rnas, including non-coding rnas, appears to be implicated in chromatin architecture and chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation  <cit> . due to the already known networking ability of the mtg proteins  <cit> , it is possible that these family of proteins are even more versatile than originally expected, being capable of networking regulatory rna in addition to chromatin regulatory/remodelling complexes at specific sites of the genome.

CONCLUSIONS
evidence has been accumulating that rna plays a role in transcriptional control. both wild type mtgs and leukemia-associated aml1-mtg fusion proteins display novel in vitro rna-binding properties. these findings lend support to the hypothesis of the involvement of an rna component in mtg-mediated chromatin regulation.
