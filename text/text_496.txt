BACKGROUND
lentil  is the world’s fifth largest pulse crop  <cit>  with annual production of 3- <dig> mt. it is produced in over  <dig> countries and is consumed in more than  <dig> countries. the crop was domesticated in southwest asia and has been produced for several millennia  <cit> . lentil is considered an orphan crop from a genomic perspective  <cit>  primarily because of the relatively small production base imposed by climatic limitations to adaptation, the limited research investment in sequencing imposed by technology costs and the relatively large size  of the genome. lentils are, however, a good source of protein, carbohydrates, micronutrients and vitamins for human nutrition, and their small size and flat shape make them relatively quick cooking and easily decorticated compared to most other grain legumes. this may account for increasing global per capita consumption over the past 50 years  <cit> . lentil provides economic and biological benefits in cereal-based cropping systems through nitrogen fixation and crop rotation. in northern temperate, mediterranean and sub-tropical savannah agricultural ecosystems, the lentil crop plays an important role in food and nutritional security on a global scale.

until recently, molecular markers for use in lentil genetic mapping have been limited to anonymous markers such as rapds, issrs and aflps  <cit>  and limited numbers of simple sequence repeat markers . phan et al.  <cit>  added several intron-targeted amplified polymorphic  gene-based markers to the collection of mapped loci. in the past five years, as the cost of genomic technologies declined, and as bioinformatic bridges were developed to access genomic information of fully sequenced model legumes like medicago truncatula, concerted efforts were initiated to develop genetic marker technology platforms for lentil. these technologies will be of great benefit to future genetic improvement efforts and to future understanding of the relationships between the cultivated lentil and its wild relatives. these benefits have already been demonstrated to a limited extent by alo et al.  <cit>  who used medicago est sequences to develop primers that amplified conserved sequences in lens spp. for diversity analysis. application of second-generation sequencing technologies to lentil has also been reported by kaur et al.  <cit> , using  <dig> shotgun sequencing of cdna samples from six different lentil genotypes to assemble unigenes and identify gene-based ssrs.

recent advances in the development of genetic marker technologies have mainly been based on the availability of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms  between different genotypes of targeted organisms. the drive to implement single nucleotide variations as markers has come from the arena of human genetics where large numbers of snps have been identified in recent years  <cit> . the implementation of snp markers in plant species in particular has been more limited, primarily because of the lack of available sequenced reference genomes. the identification of large numbers of snps for crops would allow the generation of dense linkage maps enabling applications such as high resolution qtl analysis, fine-mapping and map-based gene cloning  <cit> . the prospect of identifying markers very tightly linked to genes controlling traits of interest would also facilitate routine cost effective marker-assisted selection  <cit> .

snp marker technology is characterized by a large portfolio of genotyping methodologies that range from single-plex assays for interrogating individual loci to highly parallel multiplex assays, which can be used in various applications. for example, single-plex assays can be used for routine marker-assisted selection of thousands of individual plants for a targeted trait  <cit>  while parallel assays can be used for the generation of high density genetic maps or association mapping studies  <cit> . single-plex snp assays that have been used in legume species include cleaved amplified target loci cleaved with restriction enzymes , single strand confirmation polymorphism , allele specific pcr amplification . multiplexed snp assays include formats that accommodate either moderate levels of multiplexing such as that offered by mass spectrometry on the sequenom massarray platform  <cit>   to the highly parallel allele specific pcr amplified assays of the goldengate and infinium snp arrays developed by illumina  that are well established for a number of different crops including barley  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> .

in this paper we describe the development of a collection of 3′-cdna  <dig> reads derived from multiple lens species and genotypes, the identification and characterization of snps from this data, the selection of a subset of snps for the development of a  <dig>  snp illumina goldengate array and the use of the array to generate a comprehensive linkage map for a l. culinaris genetic mapping population.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing and snp discovery
in order to identify a breadth of nucleotide diversity across the genic regions of the lentil genome a selection of nine l. culinaris genotypes and two l. ervoides wild accessions were selected for targeted 3′-cdna transcript profiling using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology . one genotype  was pre-selected as the reference genotype in order to generate approximately triple the amount of  <dig> sequence data  compared to the other genotypes and thus enable the development of a reference de novo assembly. this process produced a base assembly consisting of  <dig>  contigs which were then filtered based on duplication, overlap and size to produce a reference assembly of  <dig>  contigs. the relatively large number of identified contigs can be explained by the targeted 3′ nature of the  <dig> transcript sequence data that enables a high read depth representation of the 3′ ends of genes. this avoids the issue of limited read depth across the entire gene space that is commonly observed with shotgun cdna  <dig> sequence data, and that consequently limits the ability to identify robust sequence variation across multiple genotypes. the high average read depth for all the different genotypes demonstrates the success of this strategy .

all lines are l. culinaris except the last two, which are l. ervoides.

 <dig>  origin indicates where line was originally collected or developed through hybridization and selection.

 <dig>  nt – northern temperate; med – mediterranean; sts – sub-tropical savannah.

 <dig>  single plant selection from ig  <dig> 

 <dig>  total non-redundant set of contigs and snps detected across all genotypes, respectively.

in contrast, an assembly of such shotgun  <dig> data from six different lentil genotypes in a previous study used approximately the same amount of  <dig> data , but identified only  <dig>  contigs  <cit> . thus, the main advantage of developing large numbers of high quality reference 3′ contigs for snp discovery is that in theory it will enable a more robust identification of common transcripts and nucleotide variants when 3′-cdna data from other genotypes is assembled against them. the larger representation of untranslated regions  of genes in the data also offers the prospect of identifying higher levels of sequence variability when compared to data containing a higher proportion of protein coding sequences, as well as a offering a better resolution of reads derived from multiple members of closely related gene families.

the development of reference assemblies of the 3′-cdna  <dig> data from the nine other l. culinaris genotypes and two l. ervoides genotypes using a custom bioinformatics pipeline , confirmed our assumption by identifying large numbers of polymorphic contigs and snps for each genotype when compared against the cdc redberry reference. a set of  <dig>  non-redundant polymorphic contigs  were identified from this analysis, containing a total of  <dig>  non redundant snps . these snps comprised  <dig>  transitions  and  <dig>  transversions  closely reflecting the nucleotide conversions seen in other plants  <cit> . the average allele frequency of the identified snps was  <dig>  for all lines and  <dig>  for the l. culinaris genotypes alone. this difference reflects that the wild accessions are derived from a secondary or perhaps tertiary genepool  <cit>  and thus a much higher degree of sequence diversity between the two species is expected. the level of nucleotide diversity within the l. culinaris genotypes  appears to follow the adapted origin of the genotypes where overall lower levels are observed between genotypes adapted to a northern temperate climate and higher levels are observed between these genotypes and others adapted to either a mediterranean  or a sub-tropical savannah environment . ill  <dig> has twice as many unique snps relative to cdc redberry compared to the next most diverse line, ill  <dig>  developed in bangladesh and released as barimasur- <dig>  <cit> , ill  <dig> is derived from a cross between ill  <dig>  and ill  <dig> selected for tolerance to rust and stemphylium blight. it is well adapted to the local growing regions of bangladesh but does not perform well in northern temperate climates due to photoperiod sensitivity . this makes it more difficult to use in northern temperate breeding programs as a source of diversity. the two genotypes that are adapted to a mediterranean climate had twice as many unique snps relative to cdc redberry compared to the northern temperate genotypes.

sequence characterization
an in silico analysis of non-redundant contigs for the presence of microsatellite repeats revealed  <dig> contigs  that contained such a repeat and represent a resource for potential genetic marker development. this will complement identified repeats from other initiatives using similar sequencing strategies in this crop  <cit> .

comparative analysis of all  <dig>  reference contigs to the sequenced annotated model legume genomes of m. truncatula and soybean  <cit>  revealed  <dig>   contigs that possessed closely related orthologous genes in the model legume genomes . the  <dig>  contigs with orthologous counterparts in m. truncatula represents  <dig> % of the total annotated genes  in this species and represents the limitation of transcript profiling in only a small set of plant tissues. it also reflects the 3′ nature of the contigs that just represent the 3′-utr of genes in a significant proportion of cases, limiting the effectiveness of identifying orthologous genes. the same analysis was carried out for just the  <dig>   polymorphic, non-redundant contigs and identified  <dig>   contigs with orthologous copies in the related model legume genomes, and accounted for  <dig>   of the total set of non-redundant snps. the classification of the gene models identified for contigs from the total set and contigs from just the polymorphic contigs was also generated according to the available and well established arabidopsis gene ontology  categories for cellular, molecular function and biological processes . this revealed a broad range of classes of genes for each set and established that 3′ genic polymorphism is represented well across all classes of genes. the range of genes is also similar to the goslim classes identified and already described by the shotgun approach adopted by kaur et al.  <cit>  and is unsurprising considering the range of plant tissues utilized in the two studies is similar. a comparison of the go slim between the total set of contigs, all polymorphic contigs, only those polymorphic between cultivated genotypes and only those polymorphic between wild genotypes  revealed a very similar profile of gene classes in each case with no evidence of any selective pressure. an overall trend in a higher proportion of the different classes being represented in the polymorphic contigs is likely explained by an overall longer length of these contigs compared to the total set of contigs .

that there were  <dig>   total and  <dig>   polymorphic lentil contigs with no orthologous loci in either model is not surprising considering the 3′ nature of the contigs; however, it is also possible that a lack of an orthologous gene is due to a high degree of divergence between orthlogous genes in the different species, the presence of lentil specific genes, or an incomplete representation of genes in the current model genome assemblies. the higher percentage of total contigs with no orthologous counterparts compared to polymorphic contigs can also be explained by a lower average contig length of the total set  compared to the polymorphic set , thus reducing the amount sequence available for comparative analysis of this nature.

annotation of the gene models in m. truncatula and soybean for polymorphic contigs also enabled snps to be classified as putative protein coding  or non-coding  in nature. this revealed  <dig>  snps as potentially exonic in nature and  <dig>  potentially in 3′-utrs. the classification of snps as exonic allows the potential for the impact of the observed variation on the codon reading frame and an estimate of time of divergence between l. culinaris and l. ervoides based upon the observed synonymous substitution rate . synonymous changes that were only observed between l. culinaris and l. ervoides  enabled an estimate of the time of divergence at  <dig>  years ago. synonymous changes observed between l. culinaris and m. truncatula led to an estimate of divergence between these two species at  <dig> million years ago  which is similar to existing estimates between lens and medicago <cit> . in total  <dig>  polymorphic contigs contained  <dig>  snps in exons where reading frame and codon could be determined across all l. culinaris and l. ervoides genotypes. of these,  <dig>  snps encoded a synonymous codon change and  <dig>  snps a non-synonymous codon change. for the latter class  <dig>  snps encoded a different amino acid property ,  <dig>  snps resulted in a non-synonymous codon change with the same properties and  <dig> snps that would result in a truncated protein due to the presence of a stop codon. interestingly, only a few less synonymous  and non-synonymous  changes were observed when only comparing amongst the l. culinaris genotypes, revealing, at least in the coding regions of this subset of genes, very little difference in observed polymorphism between l. culinaris and l. ervoides. the large number of the same changes in both species relative to medicago further reflects the significant time of divergence from a common ancestor as well as the very recent divergence of l. culinaris from l. ervoides. since the number of genotypes from each species in this study is relatively small we cannot comment on the occurrence of discrete artificial selection sweeps during the domestication and adaptation of l. culinaris as observed in other domesticated species  <cit> , or the potential for multiple origins of domestication for this species  <cit> ; however, the prospect of the availability of a whole genome sequence for l. culinaris in the relatively near future, as well as the availability of increasing amounts of sequence data from multiple l. culinaris genotypes and other lens species, will help to further elucidate the nature of the domestication process for this crop.

development of a snp genotyping platform
based on in silico mapping of m. truncatula homologues, the  <dig>  polymorphic contigs, including the  <dig>  selected for snp array development, are evenly distributed across the genome  suggesting we have sampled the gene space across the lentil genome using the targeted transcriptome profiling strategy.

kasp assays were initially designed around  <dig> snps within unique contigs for in-house validation in the  <dig> genotypes . four of the assays failed: one  was designed to bridge an exon/intron splice site based on m. truncatula and therefore was not expected to be reliable. the other three failures were possibly due to technical issues and/or erroneous m. truncatula annotation. one contig  had no predicted exon/intron boundaries and it worked in some, but not all, genotypes. of the remaining, all worked in most of the  <dig> genotypes and none gave erroneous results across all genotypes. there were several instances where there was a mismatch but this could be due to the inherent heterogeneous nature of lentil cultivars.

to further test the snps, an additional  <dig> were screened on the snp discovery lines using the kbioscience service facility in the uk. when screened on the parental lines, none failed and only  <dig> % did not match the  <dig> snp allele call . between the lr- <dig> parents,  <dig> were polymorphic and segregated in the mapping population so were used for mapping.

selection of the  <dig>  snps for the goldengate array was based on them being reported as polymorphic between at least two of the eight cultivated lentil genotypes and the reference line cdc redberry. eight of the  <dig> genotypes on the initial  <dig> sequencing panel were genotyped using this goldengate array. validation of these results was carried out by comparing them with the  <dig> base calls. of the  <dig> data points examined, 97% matched the expected genotype  demonstrating the robustness of the snp discovery strategy employed in this study. these genotypes represent parents of existing mapping populations so the data can be queried to determine if there are sufficient numbers of polymorphic loci to warrant genotyping the segregating lines with the lc <dig> goldengate opa or, if there are too few polymorphic snps, whether it would be more economical to design single-snp assays for genotyping. the array could also be used to genotype diverse germplasm to assess genetic diversity and plan future genetic studies.

linkage mapping and comparative analysis
the lr- <dig> population was genotyped with the lc <dig> goldengate opa. almost one third  of the loci were polymorphic and could be used for mapping purposes. this was in line with what was expected based on the  <dig> snp allele calls. of the remaining  <dig>  assays,  <dig>  were monomorphic in this population,  <dig>  failed completely,  <dig>  had a pattern where one of the alleles failed to amplify but the other did  and  <dig>  had patterns that appeared to represent gene duplications and could not be readily scored . further investigation of this last class of assays revealed irregularities with  <dig> contigs that were indicative of the presence of sequence duplication. the presence of segregation patterns that suggest duplicate genes is not surprising since all legumes share an ancient and defining duplication event and 20% of genes are tandemly duplicated in m. truncatula <cit> . the bioinformatics screening we employed tried to eliminate duplicates being used for the snp assay design but the nature of the 3′ data and inherent complications of de novo assembly approach for the reference likely limited its effectiveness. most of the dominant markers segregated in a fashion that allowed them to be scored by classifying the null allele according to the parent that had the same genotype. these markers were included in the mapping data and all mapped to one or other of the linkage groups.

of the polymorphic snps assayed using kasp assays,  <dig> were also represented on the lc <dig> array resulting in some contigs having multiple snp genotypes. this was invaluable in confirming the data from both types of genotyping were the same and also allowed missing data to be filled in from other snps in the contig. for mapping purposes, a haplotype based on the consensus genotype was generated for each individual contig.

there were six ssrs and  <dig> contigs that could be mapped in lr- <dig> . the map has seven linkage groups that likely represent the seven chromosomes in lentil. the linkage groups range from 58 cm to 226 cm and together they cover  <dig>  cm. there are a few large gaps but this is likely the result of mapping with gene-based markers in a genome that consists largely of repetitive elements and regions of low polymorphism in an intraspecific population derived from an adapted by adapted cross. as there is considerable collinearity between lentil and m. truncatula across these regions , we are comfortable with these gaps in this initial map. mapping in additional populations will enable us to add more markers to these regions, since many of the gaps are due to a lack of polymorphism between the parents of lr- <dig>  and build a consensus map that fills in these gaps. this mapping population was chosen for the first map due to the diverse genetic backgrounds of the parents: one is a small red lentil and the other a large green lentil and the population segregates for multiple traits for which this map will be used in the future to elucidate genetic control of these traits. this map will also form the basis for future efforts in the genetic anchoring and assembly of scaffolds and contigs derived from on-going genome sequencing initiatives .

this is the first intraspecific gene-based map of the lentil genome that can be resolved down to the same number of linkage groups as there are chromosomes. as such, it will form the basis for future mapping efforts for the lentil genome leading to the identification of markers for traits of importance in lentil breeding. the availability of this map along with easy-to-use snp markers linked to traits of interest will allow lentil breeders to finally incorporate marker-assisted selection into their breeding programs. the availability of such markers and a high through-put genotyping system will lead to improved selection efficiency and increased genetic gain in lentil breeding programs.

the lentil linkage groups have been numbered to match the corresponding m. truncatula chromosomes as best as possible . in general there are only a few translocations and a number of inversions that distinguish lentil synteny from that of m. truncatula. most notably, mt chromosome  <dig> seems to be collinear with the middle of lentil linkage group  <dig>  which is otherwise collinear with mt chromosome  <dig>  a similar break in synteny occurs when m. truncatula is compared to lotus  <cit> , m. sativa and pisum sativum <cit> . there is also a translocation involving the ends of lentil linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> that are translocated with respect to m. truncatula. finally, there are major inversions relative to m. truncatula in lentil linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> together with smaller ones within most other linkage groups. the density of markers used for comparative analysis in this study is approximately six times higher than that used in previous analyses  <cit>  and the extensive blocks of collinearity we observe between lentil and m. truncatula provides an inherent confidence in this genetic map for lentil.

all data presented in this study are available on our publically searchable database knowpulse: pulse crop breeding and genetics . specifically, the assembled  <dig> sequence contigs are available for search by name or through the blast tool provided by knowpulse. this allows researchers to find contigs with high sequence similarity to their gene of interest and thus narrow the set of polymorphic loci to those most likely to be linked to their trait of interest. the identified sequence loci known to be polymorphic between at least two of the lines are listed on each contig with their location and any known allele calls. these loci can be inspected by contig or as an independent set in the genotype listing tool where potential markers are shown as rows in a table with the known allele calls in user selected germplasm comprising the columns. this genotype listing can be narrowed to only those potential markers expected to be polymorphic  between any two user-selected genotypes allowing researchers to inspect the total known differences between the two. the loci included on the lc <dig> goldengate opa and full assay details, including primers for any kasp assays designed, are presented via this portal informing researchers of already developed markers and providing all the information necessary for the integration of these markers directly into a research project or breeding program.

having a set of gene-based markers with demonstrable collinearity with a model legume will be of use in future efforts to identify candidate genes for traits of interest. the database can be searched for orthologues of candidate genes from other species and snps within any of the lentil contigs identified, including those not represented on the array. as the database of snp allele calls expands, lines and populations likely to be segregating for these snps can be identified and used in phenotyping experiments to help confirm their association with traits of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
the targeted transcriptome profiling methodology and generated  <dig> sequence data described here represents a significant addition to existing genomics resources for lens species. it has enabled a large number of snps across a diverse range of genes to be identified in a diverse range of domesticated l. culinaris genotypes and also wild l. ervoides accessions. the collection provides a wealth of nucleotide variation that will be used by researchers and breeders for genetic analysis and breeding programs for years to come. it enabled the generation of an illumina goldengate snp array and the production of the first comprehensive snp-based genetic linkage map for l. culinaris. the map, together with the use of the array in other genetic mapping or association mapping populations, will provide the basis from which trait-based mapping can be carried out in the future. the developed genetic map also enabled a detailed comparative analysis with the model m. truncatula genome and the observed conserved synteny with this and other model legume species will ultimately facilitate the identification of candidate genes that regulate key traits in this important food crop.
