BACKGROUND
the hessian fly  is an important pest of wheat  and a member of one of the largest and most economically important families of insects, the gall midges . its genetic tractability and short generation time  make it especially attractive as an experimental model for investigating insect-plant interactions  <cit> . this capacity was first demonstrated when it was the first insect shown to have a gene-for-gene interaction with its host plant  <cit> . previously, it was used to study chromosome elimination and the function of the germ-line-limited "e" chromosomes that characterize all gall midge species  <cit> . later investigations demonstrated that it has other biological attributes that are compatible with genomic analyses, including polytene chromosomes in the larval salivary glands  <cit>  and a small genome   <cit> . the development of a physically anchored genetic map  <cit> , a syntenic analysis of a bac-based contig  <cit> , and transcriptomic analyses of the first instar salivary glands  <cit>  also demonstrated the potential of this insect for comparative genomics with other dipteran species.

improved genomic maps are essential to further develop this insect as an experimental organism. however, certain biological characteristics make fine-scale genetic mapping in the hessian fly problematic. the first problem is the relatively low number of offspring produced by single females, typically ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  which limits the resolution of a genetic map. the second problem is the small size  of the insect. this severely limits the yield of the genomic dna extracted from individuals, and the number of molecular markers that can be genetically mapped. a third problem, the insect's unusual chromosome cycle and mechanism of sex determination, makes the construction of inbred strains difficult. because this phenomenon is both central to the genetics of the insect and worthy of genomic investigation, it is briefly described below.

the germ line of the hessian fly contains both maternally and paternally derived copies of each of two autosomes  and two x chromosomes   <cit> . it also contains a variable number  of maternally inherited germ-line-limited "e" chromosomes . the e chromosomes are eliminated from all future somatic cells during the fifth cleavage division of embryogenesis  <cit> . this post-zygotic division also determines sex. embryos that eliminate the paternally inherited x chromosomes, together with the e chromosomes, possess a male determining somatic karyotype  and develop as males. those that retain both sets of x chromosomes possess a female determining somatic karyotype  and develop as females. maternal genotype determines whether the paternally derived x chromosomes are eliminated or retained in the soma  <cit> . as a consequence, an unusual mating structure is established that is resistant to inbreeding; females produce either all-female or all-male families. chromosome elimination also occurs during spermatogenesis. the result is that all sperm carry only the maternally derived autosomes and x chromosomes . genetic recombination between the homologous autosomes and x chromosomes occurs only during meiosis of oogenesis. all ova carry a single copy of each autosome and each x chromosome and a full complement  of e chromosomes . there is no heterogametic sex since all sperm and all ova are genetically equivalent and sex is determined after fertilization.

in contrast to the problems that complicate genetic analyses, the hessian fly polytene chromosomes make physical mapping relatively simple. although they lack the banding resolution of drosophila polytene chromosomes, they still provide a relatively high mapping resolution when bacterial artificial chromosomes  are used as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit> . this facility suggested that the development of a dense physical map of the hessian fly's polytene chromosomes should precede high-resolution genetic mapping. we therefore applied the high-information content fingerprinting  method developed by luo et al.  <cit>  to construct a bac contig map using three hessian fly bac libraries . the result was a first generation fpc-based physical map of the hessian fly genome that is anchored to the polytene chromosomes. it is based on restriction fingerprints of  <dig>  bac clones. the largest  <dig> contigs were positioned on the chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization . these contigs contain  <dig>  bac clones, and cover ~60% of the genome. the bac end sequences  of the clones used in this analysis were determined to provide the capacity to develop sequenced tagged site  markers evenly distributed over the genome. bac-end sequence data were also analyzed to improve our understanding of hessian fly genome organization.

RESULTS
bac fingerprinting
we subjected  <dig>  bacs to high-information content fingerprinting . the dna fingerprint profile of each bac clone was then converted into an fpc compatible format using the fp miner  <dig>  software . the standard deviation associated with the size of two vector bands present in the fingerprints of each bac  indicated that fragment size reproducibility was high  <cit> . the fp miner software was used to remove background signals and vector bands, and to assign a quality score to each bac dna fingerprint. we examined all of the fingerprints and removed  <dig> that failed to meet each of the following quality standards: 1)  <dig> to  <dig> fragments, 2) =  <dig> fragments of each of the four colors, 3) a size standard match quality score that was > <dig> , and 4) a fingerprint editing quality score that was > <dig>  the fingerprints of  <dig>  bacs  remained available for fpc assembly. the percentage of successfully fingerprinted clones compared favorably with the hicf maps developed for maize   <cit> , nile tilapia   <cit> , channel catfish   <cit> , and brassica rapa   <cit> . dna fragment sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp were imported into the fpc v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to build contigs. among the successfully fingerprinted clones,  <dig>  were derived from the hf library,  <dig>  were derived from the cl library, and  <dig> were derived from the mde library. bac clones from the hf library had an average insert size of  <dig> kb and the cl library had an average insert size of  <dig> kb. the average number of scored bands per clone in the hf library  and the cl library  was slightly less than the average observed during the construction of the maize map   <cit> , but slightly greater than the averages of the two bac libraries used to construct the nile tilapia map   <cit> . combined, the bacs in the hf and cl libraries provided an estimated  <dig> -fold coverage of the hessian fly genome . this was greater coverage than that used to construct either the nile tilapia   <cit>  or the catfish   <cit>  maps, but considerably less than the coverage used to construct the maps of b. rapa   <cit>  and maize   <cit> .

contig assembly
contigs were assembled from the fingerprint data using the computer program fpc version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . fpc parameters were adjusted for the hicf technique as described by lou et al.  <cit>  and nelson  <cit> . in each assembly, we used a tolerance  that restricted two bands with lengths greater than  <dig>  bp from being considered the same band. in the initial assembly, we used a cutoff  of 1e- <dig>  using these settings, fpc built  <dig> contigs containing from  <dig> to  <dig> bac clones per contig. the dqer function was then used to identify contigs with â‰¥ 10% questionable clones . these contigs were then gradually split using three more stringent cutoffs . this produced  <dig> contigs containing from  <dig> to  <dig> bac clones per contig. the assembly was then end merged at a cutoff of 1e- <dig>  this produced the first generation hicf hessian fly map, which consisted of  <dig> contigs, containing  <dig>  bacs, and  <dig>   singletons. the map had an average of  <dig>  bacs per contig and the largest contig contained  <dig> bacs . fpc analysis estimated that the clones used to produce the map had  <dig> , <dig> unique bands, averaging  <dig>  bands per clone. we used the known lengths of  <dig> bac clones and the total number of labeled fragments for each of these clones to estimate average band size . using this value, the assembled contigs had an estimated length of  <dig>  kb, providing approximately  <dig> -fold coverage of total genome length. the average contig length was  <dig> kb and the longest contig covered  <dig> kb of the genome. fpc identified a total of  <dig> questionable clones  in the assembly. there were  <dig> contigs with >10% qs. however, the average number of qs per contig was only  <dig> . furthermore,  <dig> contigs  had no qs, no contig had more than  <dig> qs, and the majority of the qs were in a few large contigs.

compared to the contigs of other hicf maps, the hessian fly contigs were relatively small. for example, the b. rapa, catfish, and nile tilapia maps each had greater average numbers of bacs per contig , greater average contig lengths  and lower percentages of singletons   <cit> . since both bac coverage and fragment size reproducibility were good, other factors were probably responsible for the shorter and shallower contigs in the hessian fly map. the organization of the much smaller hessian fly genome might have been one factor. however, we suspect that a greater frequency of restriction fragment length polymorphisms  in the hessian fly bac libraries was the major problem. this had been anticipated because the hessian fly bac libraries were each constructed with dna derived from thousands of individuals in heterogeneous strains that are poorly characterized. thus, indels, single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene duplications, and other rearrangements may all increase the number of mismatched bands. regardless of the cause and in spite of the relatively low number of bacs per contig, the coverage of total genome length  appeared to exceed that of the maps of b. rapa , catfish , and nile tilapia . in addition, the percentage of qs in the hessian fly assembly  was lower than that observed in maize   <cit> , b. rapa , catfish , and nile tilapia . thus, it appeared that the hessian fly contigs provided reasonable coverage with few questionable clones. this suggested that an abundance of rflps is not an absolute barrier to the construction of a hicf-based physical map.

because the bac clones were largely derived from two different libraries , we performed an fpc assembly of each library separately using the same parameters that were used to assemble both libraries combined. the bacs in the cl library assembled into a greater number of contigs  with a greater average number of bacs per contig  than the bacs in the hf library. in addition, the percentage of singletons in the cl assembly  was fewer than the singletons in the hf assembly , but the number of contigs with >10% qs was nearly the same . thus, it appeared that if rflps were interfering with contig assembly, they were more abundant in the hf library. interestingly, the sum of the total number of contigs assembled using the cl  and hf bacs  separately was only 22% greater than the total number of bacs in the combined assembly , and the sum of the coverage provided by the cl  and hf bacs  was only 9% greater than that of the combined assembly . thus, it appeared as if the contigs of one library only occasionally overlapped with the contigs of the other library and this lowered contig size more than total coverage when the libraries were combined. this possibility was also evident in the contigs of the fpc map where cl bacs tended to stack with other cl bacs and hf bacs tended to stack with other hf bacs  <cit> . it is also consistent with the suggestion that using libraries prepared with different restriction enzymes reduces the number of gaps in the assembly  <cit> .

contig validation
two different approaches were used to validate contigs in the first generation hessian fly hicf map. the first examined the fpc assembly of two contigs that had been constructed by chromosome walking . this was the only region of the hessian fly genome in which chromosome walking had been previously performed. the construction and composition of one walk  was described previously  <cit> . it consisted of  <dig> bac clones covering a  <dig> -cm genetic distance that was marked with four sts markers and a physical distance of nearly  <dig> mb. the other chromosome walk began from sts marker  <dig>  and was composed of  <dig> bac clones. together, the contigs constructed by walk- <dig> and walk- <dig> contained  <dig> mde bac clones that were analyzed by fpc. the 134-walk was deeper and contained a greater proportion of hf clones. neither chromosome walk contained clones from the cl library because that library had not yet been prepared when the walking experiments were performed. only  <dig> clones in the 124-walk were discovered in the contigs of the fpc assembly . those clones were present in  <dig> small contigs  containing a combined total of  <dig> clones. fpc assembly of the 134-walk was more successful. fpc assembled  <dig>  of the clones in the 134-walk into six contigs . the majority of those clones were assembled into two contigs: one  containing  <dig> 134-walk clones and the other  containing  <dig> 134-walk clones. an additional  <dig> cl clones were identified in these contigs. reducing the stringency of fpc assembly  merged all six contigs associated with walk- <dig> into a single contig. however, the assembly of the 124-walk was not improved. this analysis suggested that, as expected, regions of the genome with relatively deep coverage  were well represented in the map whereas regions with less depth  were poorly represented.

the second approach of assessing contig validity was to test the continuity of the  <dig> longest fpc assembled contigs using fish. in these experiments, a bac clone at one extreme of each fpc assembled contig was labeled with biotin and a bac clone at the opposite extreme was labeled with digoxigenin. separate fish experiments were performed for each contig, in which both bac clones were hybridized to the same polytene chromosome preparations . the fpc assembly was judged "valid" when both probes from the same contig co-localized on the hessian fly polytene chromosomes . the contigs examined contained from  <dig> to  <dig> bac clones per contig and ranged in length from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. using the banding patterns of the four polytene hessian fly chromosomes, we divided the hessian fly genome into  <dig> chromosomal segments , and determined which segments contained each valid contig . among the  <dig> contigs tested,  <dig> contigs  were scored as valid . in  <dig> of these valid contigs  it was possible to discern which of the two bac clones was the most proximal . it was, therefore, possible to suggest the orientation of those  <dig> contigs on the chromosomes. there were  <dig> contigs  that were determined to be "invalid." these had a greater number of qs than the valid contigs . moreover, they were easily separated into two groups: a "repetitive" group of  <dig> contigs, and a "non-repetitive" group of  <dig> contigs. the contigs in the repetitive group had at least one probe that hybridized to multiple locations . seven of these had a probe that hybridized to pericentromeric heterochromatin. the non-repetitive group had probes that hybridized to different, but unique, genomic locations. this group of contigs had a greater number of qs per contig than both the valid group of contigs and the invalid-repetitive group of contigs . we reexamined all invalid contigs by performing fish with additional bac clones selected from the same contigs. in each experiment, these clones hybridized in the same position as one of the previous bac clones . these data were then used to assign the unreliable contigs to a chromosomal segment .

total cb units
mean cb units/contig
contigs in which the probes co-localized were assessed as valid. contigs in which the probes failed to co-localize were assessed as invalid. invalid contigs were further divided into contigs that either had one or more repetitive bac probes  or no repetitive bac probes . *means significantly different from the valid mean . **means significantly different from the valid mean . â€ means significantly different from the invalid-r mean . â€ â€ means significantly different from the invalid-r mean .

*chromosome segments known to contain at least one contig with a clone that hybridized to a different segment.

using cytogenetic data to validate a physical map has been performed previously in drosophila species  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, this is the first time it has been used to anchor the physical map of an insect of agricultural importance. our method was analogous to performing linkage analysis with the two most terminal bacs in the contigs. using that approach,  <dig> of the  <dig> longest contigs  in the catfish hicf map were validated  <cit> . therefore, although the two approaches are not entirely comparable, our results suggest that the hessian fly map may have a few more errors. nevertheless, our results also clearly indicate that the hessian fly assembly was largely valid and that most errors are associated with the contigs containing the greatest number of qs. moreover, they demonstrated that the hessian fly map can be easily improved using fish as a manual contig-editing tool.

genome coverage
to further evaluate the coverage of the assembled contigs, fish was used to position  <dig> additional contigs. in these experiments, only one bac was used as probe, but we avoided invalid contigs by selecting those that had an average of only  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  qs per contig. these experiments brought the total number of bacs used as probes to  <dig> and the total number of contigs that had been fish-mapped to  <dig> . of these contigs,  <dig> were assigned to single chromosome segments. nine contigs hybridized to the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all four chromosomes, and could not be assigned to a single chromosome segment. the relative length of each chromosome segment was used as a measure of genome content so that the amount of coverage provided to each segment could be compared . except for the nucleolar organizing region , segment e, every chromosome segment contained at least one contig. the subtelomeric segments a, p, and q, as well as segments b, f, and h, had a slightly greater proportion of contigs than their relative lengths. in the remaining segments, the proportion of contigs and bacs approximated relative length. thus, the contigs appeared to be evenly distributed. disregarding the fpc assembly errors previously discovered, and ignoring the centromeric contigs,  <dig>  kb of genome length was covered by the fish mapped contigs. we observed no evidence suggesting that any contig was exclusively associated with the e chromosomes. this coverage therefore represents approximately 60% of the total content of the hessian fly autosomes and x chromosomes. moreover, the heterochromatin of these chromosomes is restricted to the centromeres  <cit> . these contigs therefore clearly appeared to be distributed in the gene rich regions of these chromosomes.

the fpc assembly was developed into a publically available webfpc archive that shows the bac clones that were used as probes to physically anchor each contig  <cit> . ordering the contigs that are currently grouped into chromosome segments will be one of the most immediate improvements we make to the map. the segments on the autosomes and the long arm of chromosome x <dig> are expected to provide sufficient resolution to order the contigs using fish. however, morphologies of the short arm of chromosome x <dig> and all of chromosome x <dig> are problematic. we therefore expect that genetic mapping will be necessary to order the contigs in the corresponding segments.

bac-end sequence
in order to fully utilize the physical map as a resource in genetic investigations, comparative analyses, and whole genome sequence assembly, we end sequenced the  <dig>  fingerprinted bac clones that were used to generate the physical map. this resulted in  <dig>  sequenced bac ends,  <dig>  paired reads, and  <dig> , <dig> bp of high quality bases of hessian fly genomic dna . if there were no overlap among the bac ends, this sequence would represent  <dig> % of the hessian fly genome. the average number of bases sequenced per successfully sequenced bac end was  <dig> Â±  <dig>  g/c content of all sequenced bacs was relatively low, averaging  <dig>  Â±  <dig> %.

a combination of a custom repeat library and repbase database  <cit>  was used to identify repetitive dna sequence. because the bacs were derived from heterogeneous strains, this analysis required parameters that limit the possibility of confusing alleles with gene families. therefore, only repetitive sequences that were > <dig> bp and present in =  <dig> copies were selected. these criteria made identification of gene families more likely, given the low coverage of bes. using these settings, we found that  <dig> % of the bes contained repetitive elements . there was, however, a  <dig> % overestimate of repetitive content due to the difficulty of assigning boundaries to different repeat classes. transposable elements  composed only  <dig> % of the repetitive dna and  <dig> % of total bes . combined, helicases, ribosomal dna , simple sequence repeats , and sequence of low complexity composed  <dig> % of the repetitive fraction. the largest fraction of repetitive dna  consisted of multigene families and unclassified tes. this observation was consistent with previous investigations of the hessian fly salivary gland transcriptome  <cit>  that discovered over  <dig> gene families of small putatively secreted proteins with no sequence similarities to other genes in genbank. in the bes, the most prominent multigene families identified appeared to be tandem copies of the calponin homology domain , thrombospondin type <dig> repeats , u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein c proteins , and smc-hinge family genes .

within the class i tes, ltr retrotransposons were more prominent than the non-ltr retrotransposons . the most prominent class ii te was the mos <dig> mariner-like dna transposable element, which accounted for  <dig> % of the repetitive fraction. the remaining class ii tes composed  <dig> % of the repetitive sequence, which had sequence similarities to the tigger <dig>  blackjack, looper, mer45r, and zaphod tes. previous investigation found an abundance of mariner-like elements in hessian fly pericentromeric heterochromatin  <cit> . therefore, it was interesting to note that the combined proportions of tes and low-complexity sequence in the bes  was virtually the same as the proportion of the bacs that hybridized to pericentromeric heterochromatin in the fish experiments that anchored the physical map to the chromosomes . these observations were consistent with a low abundance of tes in the euchromatin of the small hessian fly genome, and they suggested that the bacs that hybridized to heterochromatin contained one or more tes. this in turn suggests that seven of the eleven contigs that were initially classified as "invalid-repetitive"  would have been classified as "valid" if not for the presence of one or more tes in the bacs used as probe.

ssrs, which have a wide range of applications  <cit> , formed  <dig> % of the total bes and  <dig> % of the total repetitive fraction. the di- and tri-nucleotide repeats were  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ssrs, respectively, and were the most frequent types of ssrs found in this analysis. the most abundant di- and tri-nucleotide motifs were n and n, which composed  <dig> % of the total di-nucleotides and  <dig> % of the total tri-nucleotides, respectively. the value of 'n' ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in the n motif and from  <dig> to  <dig> in the n motif.

to identify putative genic sequences in the bes, both the repeatmasked and unmasked bess were searched against the ncbi non-redundant database using blastx  <cit> . of the  <dig>  total unmasked bes analyzed,  <dig>  had blast hits, of which  <dig>  were mapped to gene ontology  terms and  <dig>  were annotated. for the repeatmasked bes dataset,  <dig>  had blast hits,  <dig>  were assigned to go categories and  <dig>  were returned with annotations. among completely sequenced genomes, mosquitoes, which belong to the same suborder  as the hessian fly, had the highest percentages of the top scoring blastx hits . of the total number of reads that had a blast hit,  <dig>  hit a conserved protein sequence in an insect genome. in both the repeatmasked and unmasked datasets the largest go categories comprised genes involved in transcription and cellular communication. for example, genes involved in protein binding, nucleic acid and nucleotide binding, hydrolase activity, transferase and signal transduction activities comprised the largest go categories  based on the association with gene ontology terms in the molecular function category . interestingly, fewer annotated sequences were observed in the repeatmasked set for almost all categories. this observation indicated that a proportion of the predicted gene products were derived from the repetitive sequences, which when masked, resulted in lower numbers of annotations. this was also consistent with the earlier observation that multigene families composed a relatively large proportion of the repetitive bes. to examine this further, we unmasked the ssrs so that they were excluded from the repeatmasked set . again, we observed fewer annotations with that data set than with unmasked bes. therefore, multigene families and transcripts from transposable elements probably accounted for the observed differences between the two data sets.

CONCLUSIONS
hessian fly's small genome and the polytene chromosomes provided an excellent opportunity to determine if bac libraries constructed from heterogeneous strains would unduly limit the mapping abilities of the hicf and fpc technologies. although less heterogeneity would have been preferred, the results have clearly improved the hessian fly as an experimental model. a first generation map now exists that includes  <dig> fpc contigs containing  <dig>  bac clones and their associated bes positioned to  <dig> segments of the hessian fly genome. the bes provided new knowledge regarding hessian fly genome organization, and the mapped bes constitutes an abundant resource for the development of physically mapped dna markers. we expect that these improvements will be made as genetic investigations focus on the discovery of avirulence genes, the genes that are involved in plant-gall formation, and the mechanisms of chromosome elimination. in the near future, we also expect the map to facilitate the assembly of whole-genome shotgun sequences and the assignment of sequenced scaffolds to chromosome segments.
