BACKGROUND
schistosome infections occur in over  <dig> tropical and subtropical countries, with  <dig> million individuals infected, resulting in  <dig>  human deaths annually  <cit> . the pathology of chronic infections with s. japonicum includes granuloma formation in the liver, periportal fibrosis, portal hypertension and the formation of vascular shunts  <cit> . serious schistosomiasis reduces the ability of humans to work and impedes the development of agriculture and livestock. it is crucial to control schistosomiasis transmission, improve the level of public health knowledge and increase income in agriculture and livestock. at present, praziquantel  is the only safe, cheap and effective drug against human schistosome species. however, massive administration of pzq in endemic areas has raised serious concerns regarding the development of parasite resistance to pzq  <cit> . isolates of s. mansoni from patients in kisumu, kenya, were shown to have lower susceptibility to pzq  <cit> . clarifying the immune mechanisms of s. japonicum infection is an important foundation to screen effective vaccine candidates and novelty drugs against schistosomiasis.

the reed vole  has been identified as a non-permissive host of s. japonicum that has a natural resistance mechanism against schistosomes . several studies of the resistance of m. fortis to s. japonicum have been conducted. eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and serum antibodies are thought to be involved in resistance  <cit>  and nitric oxide, albumin, e <dig>  kpna <dig>  hsp <dig> were found to be resistance-associated proteins . it has been suggested that apoptosis might be employed by m. fortis for eliminating schistosomes  <cit> . this study aimed to provide new suggestions to control the spread of schistosomiasis and to further elucidate the resistance mechanisms against schistosomes in m. fortis.

because m. fortis is a new experimental animal model, biological information about it is very limited. to date, only  <dig> nucleotides,  <dig> ests and  <dig> genes of m. fortis are accessible from all ncbi databases, and no monoclonal antibodies specific for these markers are commercially available. it is therefore extremely difficult to study resistance mechanisms using immunological techniques, such as flow cytometry, western blot or microarrays. due to the high cost of genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing is a useful tool to obtain biological information and to discover and identify new genes of m. fortis. the next-generation sequencing  based rna-seq technique has been widely used for de novo transcriptome sequencing assembly, discovery of novel genes and the investigation of gene expression in many non-model organisms  <cit> . it is therefore suitable for the identification of potential resistance-related genes in m. fortis.

in this study, we sequenced the m. fortis transcriptome using illumina technology and demonstrated the suitability of short-read sequencing for the de novo assembly and annotation of genes expressed in a eukaryote without prior genome information. in addition, we compared the gene expression profiles of m. fortis up to four weeks after infection with schistosomes by using an rna-seq quantification expression system. the assembled and annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles showed that natural and adaptive immune responses, such as toll-like receptors , natural killer  cell activation and igg and ige, play important roles against s. japonicum infections. these data provide a valuable resource for the analysis of resistance genes of m. fortis against s. japonicum.

RESULTS
pathological changes in the liver
after infection with s. japonicum for 2– <dig> weeks, several white nodules were observed in the liver of m. fortis, which disappeared 3– <dig> weeks after infection. the liver was then restored to its original color, structure and texture. this phenomenon was also observed by shao  <cit>  and it is speculated that these white nodules are induced by a schistosomulum  <cit> . some reports described many worm-granulomas detected in the liver of m. fortis, schistosomula were impaired by inflammatory cells surrouding  <cit> . conversely, no changes occurred in the livers of balb/c mice  after the first four weeks of infection. high numbers of liver granulomas were observed after the deposition of eggs in the liver of mice .figure  <dig>

illumina sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly
to obtain an overview of an m. fortis gene expression profile, cdna from the liver of m. fortis was generated and sequenced using the illumina sequencing platform. after removing adaptors and low quality reads,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from sequencing. the gc content and q <dig> were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. these reads were assembled with the trinity software. after clustering using the tgicl program, we obtained  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  unigenes  with an n <dig> of  <dig>  nt . simultaneously, an abundance of unannotated unigenes was generated in our study, which might represent a specific gene pool of interest for further m. fortis studies.

function annotation and classification of assembled transcripts
to annotate these unigenes, we searched the reference sequences using blastx against the ncbi non-redundant  and swiss-prot protein databases with a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   were obtained as significant hits using the respective databases . however, there were still many sequences  without blastx hits. these sequences might be new genes or non-coding rna sequences. among these,  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated with the nr, nt, swiss-prot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes , cog and gene ontology  by blast databases, and functional bioinformatics analyses. the annotation results show that the species cricetulus griseus , mus musculus , and rattus norvegicus  were highly homologous with m. fortis .figure  <dig> 
homology analysis of

transcriptome. all distinct gene sequences that had blast annotations within the nr database with a cut-off e-value ≤ 10– <dig> were analyzed for: a: e-value distribution; b: similarity distribution; c: species distribution.



to evaluate our transcriptome library, we searched the annotated sequences for the genes involved in cog classifications  <cit> . unigenes were aligned to the cog database to predict and classify possible functions. a total of  <dig>  sequences were functionally classified into  <dig> cog categories. the largest number of unigenes focused on “the general function of prediction” class, the second-largest groups were in the “replication, recombination and repair” and “transcription” classes, followed by “cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning”, “chromosome partitioning”, “posttranslational modification” and “protein turnover” . to further evaluate the completeness of the de novo assembly transcriptome and predict possible functions, a go functional annotation was used to classify the functions of the predicted m. fortis genes. in total,  <dig>  sequences could be categorized into  <dig> functional groups in the three main categories of “cellular component”, “molecular function” and “biological process”. in these categories the number of unigenes categorized as “biological process” accounted for nearly 40%. this dominant processes were involved in developmental biology, biosynthesis, metabolism, stimulus–response and signal transduction. a few genes were associated with terms such as “cell killing”, “nucleoid”, “chemoattractant activity”, “chemorepellent activity”, “receptor regulator activity” and “translation regulator activity” .figure  <dig>

the kegg is a bioinformatics resource for linking genomes to life and the environment and for understanding high-level gene functions in terms of networks of the biological system . in our research,  <dig>  unigenes were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways . among them, “metabolic pathways” , “pathways in cancer”  and “regulation of actin cytoskeleton”  were dominant. in  <dig> kegg pathways, there were  <dig> pathways involved in immune and inflammatory responses , such as endocytosis , mapk signaling pathway , chemokine signaling pathway , wnt signaling pathway  and fc gamma r-mediated phagocytosis . the gene catalog provided a comprehensive understanding of the gene transcription profiles of m. fortis, and it provided a valuable foundation for screening differential expression genes after infection with s. japonicum.table  <dig>

degs involved in the response to infection with s. japonicum
to investigate the changes in gene expression and understand the critical genes in m. fortis responses to s. japonicum, we used rna-seq technology to study transcriptional changes. clean reads of m. fortis that were infected with s. japonicum from 1– <dig> weeks were respectively mapped to the de novo assembly transcriptome reference sequences of m. fortis using soap aligner/soap <dig>  <cit> . the clean reads mapped to the genes were approximately  <dig> % to  <dig> % in the four respective libraries, in which approximately  <dig> % to  <dig> % reads were perfectly matched . the expression levels of the unigenes were calculated using the rpkm algorithm. the rpkm values can be directly used for comparing the differences in gene expression among samples. we used “fdr ≤  <dig>  and the absolute value of log <dig> ratio ≥ 2” as threshold to judge the significance of gene expression difference. from these results, the amounts of degs were detected at different time points pre- and post-infection . based on rna-seq  analysis, it was shown that the number of up-regulated genes at the second week after infection was  <dig> , which was much higher than that at other weeks. compared to the second week after infection, the numbers of down-regulated genes at the third and fourth weeks after infection were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. a high number of degs in the liver of m. fortis overlapped at different points after infection .table  <dig>

go and pathway functional enrichment analysis of degs
to understand the functions of the degs, we performed go functional enrichment and kegg pathway analyses using a hypergeometric distribution model. when comparing m. fortis samples before infection and four weeks after infection, the terms “cell periphery”, “extracellular space”, “plasma membrane”, “external side of plasma membrane”, “extracellular region”, “cell surface” and “cytoplasm” showed the most significant differences .

by analyzing the statistically enriched go function related to the degs, it was revealed that the most significant and most frequently enriched terms for up-regulated transcripts after infection were inflammatory- and immunity-correlated genes. the first class included pattern recognition receptors , such as mannose-binding lectin , c-reactive protein , scavenger receptor , complement receptor  and tlrs . the second class consisted of cytokines and complement-related unigenes, such as interferon-gamma -related unigenes , tumor necrosis factor -related unigenes  and complement-related unigenes . the third class was comprised of lymphocyte activation-related molecules, such as t- and b lymphocyte-related unigenes  and macrophage-related unigenes .

pathways related to the degs related to inflammatory and immunity responses were “antigen-processing and presentation”, “intestinal immune network for iga production”, “natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity”, “b cell receptor signaling pathway”, “mapk signaling”, “nf-kappa b”, “jak-stat signaling”, “toll-like receptor signaling”, “tgf-beta signaling pathway”, “wnt signaling pathway” and “complement and coagulation cascades” .table  <dig>

validation of illumina expression patterns by qrt-pcr analysis
to confirm the reliability of the sequencing analysis and to verify the relationship of unigenes to resistance against s. japonicum, eight candidate degs were selected and detected by qrt-pcr. agarose gel electrophoresis results showed that eight primer pairs obtained a band of the expected size. the profile of their expression was consistent with the results from the rna-seq  and the results suggested that the unigene data were highly reliable. in m. fortis, unigenes were up-regulated for the first three weeks after infection, and gradually decreased at the fourth week after infection. in mice, the unigenes were up-regulated after the third or the fourth week after infection. the time point of up-regulation for genes in balb/c mice was delayed by 3– <dig> weeks compared to m. fortis. the expression time points and expression levels of unigenes in different hosts were thus significantly different .figure  <dig>

potential resistance-associated molecular analysis in m. fortis
we further analyzed degs to select up-regulated or down-regulated unigenes in the first three weeks after infection. in this period, the reaction to removing schistosomula from m. fortis was the most dramatic. unigenes showing changes during this period might be potential resistance genes. these up-regulated unigenes were grouped into the following categories:  metabolism-related unigenes, such as glutathione s-transferase kappa  <dig>  gtpase family m protein  <dig>   <dig> beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, calcium-dependent phospholipase a <dig>  mitochondrial precursor, apolipoprotein l, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein  <dig>  serpin b9-like, cytochrome p <dig> 4a10;

 immunity-related unigenes, such as immunoglobulin igg heavy chain, h- <dig> class i histocompatibility antigen, cd <dig> antigen, mhc class ii antigen, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1-like, interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  lymphocyte antigen 86-like, t cell surface glycoprotein cd <dig> alpha chain-like, b cell linker protein, monocyte differentiation antigen cd14-like;

 inflammation-related unigenes, such as fibronectin precursor, c-x-c motif chemokine 10-like, c-c motif chemokine  <dig>  janus kinase 3;

 apoptosis-related genes, such as caspase- <dig> and bcl- <dig> homologous antagonist.



the results showed that unigenes down-regulated after infection were, among others, salivary gland secretion protein  <dig>  cholesterol 7-alpha-monooxygenase, udp-glucuronosyltransferase 2b1-like isoform  <dig>  udp-glucuronosyltransferase 1-9-like, hematopoietically expressed homeobox, zinc finger and btb domain-containing protein  <dig>  these results showed that after infection of m. fortis with s. japonicum, metabolism, immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis-related gene expression levels increased, whereas synthesis was reduced.

discussion
m. fortis and balb/c mice are non-permissive and permissive hosts of s. japonicum, respectively. after infection, the profiles of gene expression, immune response and pathological changes of the two hosts were significantly different. a previous study revealed that the lungs and liver of m. fortis, rats and mice display different characteristics when infected with s. japonicum for 10 days. m. fortis and rats, both of which are resistant to s. japonicum, developed a stronger immune response and more severe pathological lesions in response to schistosomes than mice during the early phase of the infection  <cit> . after infection with s. japonicum, levels of cytokines, complements and antibodies were significantly higher in m. fortis than in mice  <cit> . in our study, the changes in cytokine expression were detected by using protein microarrays in the sera of m. fortis voles and c57bl/ <dig> mice. levels of th <dig>  th <dig>  and th <dig> cytokines in m. fortis voles increased significantly during the first 3 weeks post-infection, while there was no significant changes in mice . it has been found that after infection with s. japonicum for 1 week, serine protease inhibitor gene expression was up-regulated and immune-associated gene expression did not change in the lung tissue of mice. conversely, some important immune-associated genes  were up-regulated, and serine protease inhibitor gene expression did not change in m. fortis  <cit> . pathological changes in the liver of m. fortis were significant during the first 3 weeks post-infection, while there was no significant changes in the liver of mice . these results help to clarify molecular mechanisms of infection immunity in different hosts of s. japonicum, which might provide new ways to prevent and control schistosomiasis.

to investigate the changes in gene expression and understand the critical genes in the response of m. fortis to s. japonicum infection, rna-seq  analysis was performed and various differently-expressed genes were obtained. the number of up-regulated genes at the second week after infection was  <dig> , which was higher than at other time points. compared to the second week after infection, the number of down-regulated genes at the third and the fourth week after infection was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which was higher than at other weeks. it was thus concluded that the in vivo response of m. fortis was the most intense at the second week after infection. three weeks after infection, the response to schistosomes in m. fortis gradually leveled off. this result was consistent with pathological changes in the liver after infection. go and pathway functional enrichment analysis of the degs showed that “cell periphery”, “extracellular space”, “plasma membrane”, “external side of plasma membrane”, “extracellular region”, “cell surface” and “cytoplasm” were the most significantly changed categories. these structures include metabolic enzymes, cell surface receptors, signaling molecules, and platelet-derived growth factor-binding structures. the most significantly and most frequently enriched terms that were up-regulated transcripts after infection were inflammatory, immunity-correlated genes, and metabolism-related enzymes .

nk cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocytes critical to the innate immune system. they control immune responses by secreting cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α  and interferon-γ , and eliminate target cells by polarized exocytosis of cytotoxic granules containing perforin, granzymes and fas ligand  <cit> . binding of ifn-γ  to its receptors activates the jak-stat pathway and has an immune-modulatory function  <cit> . ifn-γ  can stimulate macrophages and induce direct antimicrobial and antitumor mechanisms. it can also up-regulate antigen-processing and antigen-presenting pathways  <cit> . ifn-γ orchestrates leukocyte attraction, thus enhancing nk cell activity and regulating b cell functions, such as immunoglobulin  production and class switching  <cit> . our results show that unigenes involved in ifn-γ, such as interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig>  interferon regulatory factor  <dig> and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1-like, were significantly up-regulated. simultaneously, by using genome oligonucleotide microarrays, some studies also reported that after infection with s. japonicum for 10 days, a gene similar to ifn-γ receptor  <dig> was up-regulated in the lungs of m. fortis  <cit> . members of the tnf/tnf-receptor  superfamily coordinate the immune response at multiple levels, such as by lymphoid neogenesis, augmenting immune responses and apoptosis dependent on caspase  <dig>  among these, acute tnf-r engagement can induce the rapid and robust activation of nf-κb and mapk pathways  <cit> . in our study, the tnf-related genes and pathways were significantly up-regulated. these included tnf-receptor binding  superfamily, tnf-mediated signaling pathway, tnf-activated receptor activity member 1b precursor, tnf binding, caspase  <dig> , apoptosis, nf-κb and mapk pathways. this indicates that ifn-γ and tnf might play important roles in the response against s. japonicum infections.

tlrs are among the best-characterized prrs and are key regulators of anti-pathogen immune responses. schistosomal-derived lysophosphatidylcholine participates in the production of cytokines, such as tnf-α and il- <dig>  and in eosinophil activation through a tlr2-dependent pathway in s. mansoni and s. haematobium infection  <cit> . antigen-presenting cells  recognize lysophosphatidylserine and schistosomal glycolipids of schistosomes through tlrs, leading to nf-κb and mapk signaling pathway activation and inducing inflammatory cytokine production  <cit> .

the cd <dig> antigen is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored receptor known to serve as a co-receptor for several tlrs that were significantly up-regulated in m. fortis after infection with s. japonicum. earlier studies showed a role for cd <dig> as a co-receptor working with tlr <dig> and facilitating cellular responses to low doses of lipopolysaccharide . upon lps stimulation, cd <dig> enables the activation of the tlr4-tram-trif pathway and leads to the activation of nfat transcription factor family members  <cit> . this suggests that cd <dig> and tlrs play an important role in initiating inflammation by responding to lps stimulation in m. fortis.

adaptive immunity is an important part of the anti-schistosomiasis mechanism in m. fortis. three weeks after infection, many unigenes were involved in adaptive immunity, including immunoglobulin igg heavy chain, fc receptor of ige and cd8a antigen protein complex, cd <dig>  antibodies are major components of the immune system. igg is the main antibody isotype found in blood and extracellular fluid, allowing it to control the infection of body tissues. igg can mediate a variety of biological functions, such as the classical pathway of complement activation, adcc, hypersensitivity, and can block pathogens. the fc receptors of ige are proteins called fc-epsilon receptors  found on the surface of certain cells - including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils and langerhans cells - that contribute to the protective functions of the immune system  <cit> . the cd <dig> antigen is a cell surface glycoprotein found on most cytotoxic t lymphocytes that mediates efficient cell-cell interactions within the immune system. cd <dig>  known as the major histocompatibility complex  class ii invariant chain, regulates the trafficking of mhc-ii in apcs and acts as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor . after the binding of the mif, nf-κb and erk1/ <dig> activation occurs, along with the induction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion  <cit> . it has been reported that the serum of m. fortis was passively transferred in mice, which not only reduced worm burden but also led to worm shortening  <cit> . another report showed that purified igg <dig> antibodies from laboratory-bred m. fortis and wild m. fortis effectively killed schistosomula, and that igg <dig> antibodies of wild m. fortis induced a higher worm-reduction rate. the death rates of schistosomula due to igg <dig> antibody purified from the sera of laboratory-bred m. fortis and wild m. fortis were  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than in km mice, respectively  <cit> . it has been shown that the sera and/or spleen cells of m. fortis had an important effect on killing schistosomula in vitro. this study could also show a synergism between sera of m. fortis and spleen cells  <cit> . in our study, after infection with s. japonicum for three weeks, cytokines  in the sera of m. fortis were significantly increased, whereas cytokine levels of the balb/c mice were much lower . these findings suggest that these parasite-killing effects were performed in part by cd8+ t and b lymphocytes.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we first characterized the m. fortis de novo transcriptome and performed rna-seq quantification analysis after infection with s. japonicum. a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean reads,  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  unigenes were obtained. based on the assembled de novo transcriptome, the amount of degs that play significant roles in the response to schistosome infection were identified. the numbers of degs at weeks 1– <dig> were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. we concluded that the in vivo response of m. fortis was the most intense at the second week after infection. go and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that after infection the up-regulated degs were predominately involved in metabolism, inflammation response and immunity response. the natural and adaptive immune responses, particularly nk cell activation producing ifn-γ and tgf-β, tlr activation of macrophages, and igg and ige antibodies produced by b lymphocytes, play an important role in m. fortis resistance against s. japonicum. multiple candidate genes involved in innate immune responses were identified further with qrt-pcr, and expression patterns in m. fortis and balb/c mice were compared. the results reflected significant differences of innate immune responses and different sensitivities in the hosts of schistosomes. this study provides a valuable molecular basis for the analysis of m. fortis resistance mechanisms against s. japonicum.
