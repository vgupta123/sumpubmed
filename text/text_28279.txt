BACKGROUND
cell-extracellular matrix  interactions play crucial roles in the regulation of the various known cellular processes  <cit> . the biological functions attributed to cell-ecm interactions are mediated primarily by heterodimeric  transmembrane receptors of the integrin family  <cit> . so far,  <dig> α subunits and  <dig> β subunits have been identified in humans, with α subunits non-covalently associating with β subunits, consequently forming  <dig> distinct heterodimeric  receptors with differing ligand specificities  <cit> . some α and β subunits can undergo post-transcriptional alternative mrna splicing, or post-translational proteolytic processing  <cit> . this largely results in variants with alterations in their cytoplasmic tails, thus adding further versatility to their roles and functions  <cit> . it is those integrins that have the β <dig> subunit in common which constitute the majority of receptors for ecm components  <cit> . also of this group is the α6β <dig> integrin, which is expressed exclusively in epithelial cells  <cit> .

the binding of an integrin to its ecm ligand generates a vast range of transduction signals which affect cell behavior, cell shape, and gene expression  <cit> . to this effect, signaling by β <dig> integrins owes largely to the recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase fak. in turn, fak typically recruits and activates the tyrosine kinase src  <cit> . conversely, the α6β <dig> integrin engages src, but not fak  <cit> . regardless, integrin-mediated signal transduction involves the downstream engagement of a plethora of pathways, largely due to the formation of diverse signaling cassettes through the recruitment by fak, and/or src, of an increasing array of macromolecules  <cit> . in this respect, it is established that a given repertoire of expressed integrins not only engenders distinct signals for a specific cell type, but also exerts a differential modulation of cell processes within the same tissue  <cit> .

caspase-dependent apoptosis constitutes a finely regulated process which performs crucial functions in tissue development and homeostasis  <cit> . it is now well understood that normal cells are intrinsically wired by default to undergo apoptosis and, consequently, require the input of signals in order to maintain the process in a suppressed mode when not warranted  <cit> . one of the critical biological roles performed by cell-ecm interactions is the maintenance of cell survival  <cit> . to this effect, normal cells undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis through a process termed anoikis  whenever a disruption, or loss, of integrin-mediated anchorage occurs  <cit> . indeed, integrin signaling, largely via the activation of fak and/or src, leads to the engagement of numerous pathways that promote cell survival and the suppression of anoikis  <cit> .

the main distinction between apoptosis and anoikis lies with the activation of casp- <dig> as initiator caspase in the latter  <cit> , although such activation ultimately leads to the activation of the common apoptotic initiator casp- <dig>  in order to render the process irreversible  <cit> . like apoptosis, anoikis performs important functions during organogenesis, as well as in tissue maintenance and renewal  <cit> , <cit> . in this respect, it is now recognized that normal cells are endowed with a default anchorage-dependent surveillance system, which is responsible for upholding the correct position of cells within their respective tissues, and thereby sentencing to death-by-anoikis any cell that would stray from its assigned position – by either interacting with an inappropriately composed ecm, or by losing anchorage altogether  <cit> .

the intestinal epithelium is a useful physiological system for understanding the functional connections between integrin-mediated cell-ecm interactions and the cell state  <cit> . the continuous renewal of this simple columnar epithelium occurs along a well-defined unit, the crypt-villus axis. this unit consists generally in two cell populations: the proliferative, immature cells of the crypt, and the differentiated cells of the villus  <cit> . as part of the dynamic process of intestinal epithelial cell  renewal, obsolete iecs typically enter anoikis upon reaching the apex of the villi, as a means of exfoliation  <cit> . for their part, crypt cells occasionally undergo apoptosis in order to remove daughter cells that are damaged or defective  <cit> . such apparent contrast of destiny between undifferentiated and differentiated iecs has been shown to implicate differentiation state-related distinctions in the regulation of cell survival, apoptosis, and anoikis  <cit> . incidentally, crypt and villus iecs express differential profiles of integrins as they interact with specific ecm components, which are likewise deposited differentially, along the crypt-villus axis  <cit> . hence, the question remains open as to whether such differentiation state-specific repertoires of integrins contribute distinctively in the regulation of iec anoikis.

in this study, we investigated the roles of the α2β <dig>  α3β <dig>  α5β <dig> and α6β <dig> integrins in the suppression of anoikis in undifferentiated  and differentiated  human iecs, including with regards to their contributions in the activation of fak and/or src. herein, we show that differentiated iecs exhibit a greater sensitivity to anoikis than undifferentiated ones, when kept in suspension. to this effect, we find that β <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunit-containing integrins, as well as fak, perform significantly greater contributions in the suppression of anoikis in differentiated cells. additionally, we show that the α2β <dig> and α5β <dig> integrins suppress anoikis in undifferentiated cells only, whereas α3β <dig> does so exclusively in differentiated ones. furthermore, α6β <dig> performs significantly greater contributions in the suppression of anoikis, in differentiated cells. we also provide evidence that α6β <dig> contributes to the suppression of anoikis in a primarily α <dig> subunit-dependent manner in undifferentiated cells, whereas in differentiated cells, this same integrin does so through a dependence on both of its subunits. taken together, our results indicate that the suppression of human iec anoikis implicates differentiation state-selective repertoires of integrins, which in turn results into distinctions in anoikis regulation, and sensitivity, between undifferentiated and differentiated iecs. lastly, these findings further the functional understanding of the concept that cell survival, and the suppression of anoikis, are subjected to cell differentiation state-selective mechanisms.

RESULTS
human iecs display a distinct sensitivity to anoikis according to their state of differentiation
we first established a time-course appearance of caspase-activated dnase -mediated dna laddering, in both undifferentiated  and differentiated  iecs, maintained 0-24 h in suspension. in undifferentiated cells, dna laddering was weakly discernible around 8 h, in order to increase in intensity to a maximum after 24 h , as we reported previously  <cit> . while similar kinetics of dna laddering were observed in differentiated cells, we found that internucleosomal dna fragmentation became weakly discernible round the 4 h time-point, instead of the 8 h one noted for their undifferentiated counterparts , as we previously reported  <cit> .

we then established the concomitant time-course kinetics of the specific activities of the initiator caspases casp- <dig> and - <dig>  as well as that of the executioner caspase casp- <dig> . in undifferentiated iecs, casp- <dig> activity was weakly detectable around 2 h, thereafter peaking around 8 h . casp- <dig> activity was weakly detectable around 4 h and peaked around 12 h , indicating that its activation/activity followed that of casp- <dig>  as expected  <cit> . in turn, casp- <dig> activity was likewise weakly detectable around 4 h, increasing thereafter to a maximum around the 24 h time-point . overall, the kinetics of casp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> activities paralleled that of the appearance of internucleosomal dna fragmentation . of particular interest is the 8 h time-point, where all three caspases began exhibiting strong-to-high activities, thus coinciding with the emergence of discernible dna laddering . although similar kinetics of casp- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> activities were observed in differentiated iecs, which likewise paralleled that of the appearance of dna laddering in these cells , we found that it was instead at the 4 h time-point where all three caspases began exhibiting strong-to-high activities . again, this coincided with the emergence of discernible internucleosomal dna fragmentation .

we have previously shown that the integrin-mediated suppression of anoikis in human iecs engages fak and src  <cit> . hence, we analyzed the impacts of the pharmacological inhibition of fak and src in both undifferentiated and differentiated iecs, in relation to the maintenance of these cells in suspension. controls consisted of adhering, non-treated cell cultures. as shown in figure 2a, the inhibition of fak, src, or the maintenance in suspension, induced significant anoikis in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells. interestingly, the inhibition of fak, as well as the maintenance in suspension, induced anoikis at significantly greater levels in differentiated iecs. however, the inhibition of src induced apoptosis/anoikis without significant differences between undifferentiated iecs and their differentiated counterparts .

the relative activation levels of fak and src were then analyzed, in both control and treated cultures, in order to validate the efficiency of our treatments. additionally, functional fak-src interactions were assessed by analyzing the relative phosphorylation levels of the y576/ <dig> residues of fak, enacted by src  <cit> . as expected  <cit> , the inhibition of fak in both undifferentiated and differentiated iecs caused a significant down-activation of fak itself and of src, along with a significant decrease in fak-src interactions, as when cells were kept in suspension . in the same vein, the inhibition of src in both undifferentiated and differentiated iecs resulted in its own down-activation and a significant decrease in fak-src interactions, again as when cells were kept in suspension . surprisingly, while the inhibition of src had no effect on the activation of fak in undifferentiated cells, it did result in a significant down-activation of fak in differentiated ones .

therefore, these data altogether establish firmly that differentiated human iecs exhibit a sensitivity to anoikis that is distinct from their undifferentiated counterparts. additionally, these results not only show that such differentiation state-distinctions are associated with specific contributions from fak and src in suppressing anoikis, but furthermore suggest a differentiation state-selective crosstalk between fak and src, with regards to their respective activation.

differentiation state-distinct contributions of β <dig> and β <dig> integrins in the suppression of anoikis in human iecs
to further understand mechanistically the differentiation state-related distinctions in the regulation of anoikis in human iecs, cells were exposed to specific mouse monoclonal antibodies directed to the extracellular domain of the β <dig>  or β <dig>  integrin subunits, in order to inhibit their binding activity. controls constituted of cell cultures exposed to mouse igg’s , or to no antibodies/igg’s . it must be noted here that human iecs express the integrin subunits β <dig> and β <dig>  regardless of the state of differentiation  <cit> . however, undifferentiated/crypt human iecs, but not differentiated/villus ones, express a co-translational proteolysis-processed β <dig> variant that lacks a small cooh-terminal fragment in its cytoplasmic domain   <cit> .

as expected from our previous reports  <cit> , the exposure to igg’s did not affect the survival of either undifferentiated or differentiated iecs, as assessed by dna laddering . the inhibition of the β <dig> integrin subunit induced anoikis regardless of the state of differentiation, although dna laddering appeared more abundant in differentiated iecs . by contrast, the inhibition of β <dig> did not affect the survival of undifferentiated cells, whereas it induced anoikis in differentiated ones .

to further confirm these results, anoikis was instead measured by isel, and the data from treated  cultures were then compared to those of basal  controls. again, igg’s did not affect the survival of undifferentiated or differentiated iecs . however, the inhibition of β <dig> induced cell death regardless of the state of differentiation . additionally, such negative impact on cell survival was significantly greater in differentiated cells , in keeping with the observed greater intensity of dna laddering . lastly, the inhibition of β <dig> once again failed to affect the survival of undifferentiated iecs, while producing significant cell death in differentiated ones .

we then analyzed the relative activation levels of fak and src, as well as functional fak-src interactions, in the same treated and untreated cell cultures. as expected  <cit> , the exposure to igg’s did not affect the activation of either fak or src, and did not influence fak-src interactions . however, the inhibition of β <dig> resulted in a significant down-activation of both fak and src, as well as in a significant decrease in fak-src interactions, regardless of the state of differentiation . these effects were similar as those observed when cells were maintained in suspension . by contrast, the inhibition of β <dig> did not affect the activation of fak in undifferentiated or differentiated cells , as expected  <cit> . interestingly, the inhibition of this subunit did result in a significant down-activation of src in differentiated iecs only , while at the same time failing to affect functional fak-src interactions regardless of the state of differentiation .

hence, these data altogether, along with those of the previous section, indicate that β <dig> and β <dig> integrins perform distinct contributions in the suppression of iec anoikis not only according to the state of differentiation, but also via their properties in engaging fak and/or src.

differentiation state-distinct contributions of α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> integrin subunits in the suppression of anoikis in human iecs
to further understand the differentiation state-distinct contributions of the β <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits in the suppression of anoikis, iecs were exposed to specific mabs directed to the extracellular domains of the α <dig> , α <dig> , α <dig> , or α <dig>  integrin subunits, allowing for the inhibition of their binding activities. again, controls constituted of cultures exposed to mouse igg’s, or to no antibodies/igg’s. it must be specified here that human crypt iecs express predominantly the α <dig> and α <dig> integrin subunits, with little or no α <dig>  whereas villus cells express predominantly the α <dig> integrin subunit, with little or no α <dig> and α <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, hiec, undifferentiated caco-2/ <dig> cells, and differentiated caco-2/ <dig> cells, display in vitro expression profiles of these integrin subunits that are similar to their in vivo crypt and villus counterparts, respectively . in any case, it is known that the α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> integrin subunits partner with β <dig>  in human iecs  <cit> . conversely, the α <dig> integrin subunit is expressed in human iecs regardless of the state of differentiation   <cit> . however, it partners exclusively with the β <dig> subunit and, consequently, constitutes the α6β4ctd- and α6β <dig> receptors in undifferentiated/crypt and differentiated/villus cells, respectively  <cit> .

as assessed by isel, the inhibition of the α <dig> integrin subunit induced significant cell death in undifferentiated cells, but not in differentiated ones . likewise, the inhibition of α <dig> produced significant anoikis in undifferentiated iecs only . by contrast, the inhibition of α <dig> induced significant cell death in differentiated iecs, but not in undifferentiated ones . finally, the inhibition of α <dig> produced abundant anoikis regardless of the state of differentiation, although its impact to this effect was significantly greater in differentiated cells .

taken altogether with our previous results regarding the β <dig> and β <dig> integrin subunits, these data indicate that the α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  and α <dig> subunits perform differentiation state-selective contributions in the suppression of human iec anoikis not only according to their differentiation state-associated expression, but also depending on which β subunit  they are known to partner with.

differentiation state-distinct contributions of α <dig>  α <dig>  and α <dig>  in the engagement of fak and src by the β <dig> integrin subunit, in the suppression of human iec anoikis
since the α <dig>  α <dig>  and α <dig> integrin subunits partner with β <dig> in human iecs  <cit> , we analyzed the relative activation levels of fak and src, as well as fak-src interactions, following the mab-mediated inhibition of the binding activity of each of these three α subunits. in undifferentiated cells, the inhibition of α <dig> and α <dig>  but not α <dig>  resulted in a significant down-activation of both fak and src, as well as in a significant decrease in fak-src interactions . by contrast, in differentiated cells, the inhibition of α <dig>  but not α <dig> or α <dig>  resulted in a significant down-activation of fak and src, as well as in a significant decrease in fak-src interactions . overall, these results further confirm the differentiation state-distinct contributions of α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> in the suppression of anoikis , in addition to corroborating the results obtained following the inhibition of fak, of src, and of the β <dig> subunit .

altogether, these data indicate that the α2β <dig>  α3β <dig>  and α5β <dig> integrins perform differentiation state-selective functions in the fak/src signaling-mediated suppression of human iec anoikis.

differentiation state-distinct contributions of α <dig> in the engagement of src by the β <dig> integrin subunit, in the suppression of human iec anoikis
as already noted, the α6β4ctd- and α6β <dig> integrins are expressed in undifferentiated/crypt and differentiated/villus cells, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, the α6β4ctd- receptor is non-functional for anchorage, as ascertained by the inhibition of α <dig>  β <dig>  or both, in human iec adhesion assays  <cit> . thus, our findings in these cells that the inhibition of β <dig> binding activity failed to induce anoikis , or impact significantly on src activation , corroborated such a lack of binding functionality for α6β4actd-. however, our additional findings that, in these same undifferentiated iecs, the inhibition of α <dig> binding activity nevertheless induced cell death , constituted a contradiction to this effect.

we therefore analyzed the relative activation levels of fak and src in undifferentiated and differentiated iecs, following the inhibition of α <dig> binding activity. as always, controls constituted of cultures exposed to mouse igg’s, or to no antibodies/igg’s. in undifferentiated cells, the inhibition of α <dig> caused a significant down-regulation of src , which was in line with its induction of cell death , but again in contradiction with the failure of the inhibition of β <dig> to impact on either parameters . however, the inhibition of α <dig> did not impact significantly on functional fak-src interactions , or the activation of fak itself , as similarly observed when β <dig> binding activity was inhibited .

in differentiated cells, α <dig> inhibition likewise caused a significant down-activation of src, while failing to affect fak-src interactions, or fak activation . however, these results in differentiated iecs were consistent with those already obtained via the inhibition of β <dig> . also, these agreed with regards to the induction of anoikis in these same differentiated iecs, when either α <dig> or β <dig> were inhibited .

in an attempt to resolve the apparently enduring inconsistencies in our results pertaining to each subunit of α6β4ctd- in undifferentiated iecs, we opted for the shrna-mediated knockdown of α <dig> in these cells, using a lentiviral approach of delivery. as shown in figure 9a, the shα <dig> we used caused a reduction in the expression of the α <dig> subunit by at least 80%, as compared to when cells were infected with a shcns, or with gfp. we then verified the impact of such α <dig> knockdown on the survival of undifferentiated iecs. as expected from our α <dig> inhibition studies , the shα <dig> induced significant anoikis in undifferentiated human iecs .

we also analyzed the relative activation levels of fak and src, as well as fak-src interactions, following such knockdown of α <dig>  as expected from our α <dig> inhibition studies , the shα <dig> caused a significant reduction of src activation without impacting significantly on the activation of fak, or fak-src interactions .

therefore, these data altogether indicate that both α6β4ctd- and α6β <dig> contribute in the suppression of anoikis via the engagement of a functional pool of src that does not interact with fak and, therefore, which is distinct from the one engaged by β <dig> integrins. however, these results also suggest that the contributions of α6β4ctd- in the suppression of anoikis in undifferentiated iecs appear to be primarily dependent on its α <dig> subunit, whereas α6β <dig> enacts significantly greater contributions than it’s anchorage non-functional counterpart in the suppression of anoikis in differentiated iecs, in addition to doing so through a dependence on both its α <dig> and β <dig> subunits.

discussion
in the present study, we investigated the differentiation state-specific roles of the α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig>  and β <dig> integrin subunits in the suppression of iec anoikis, including with regards to their contributions in the activation of fak and/or src. human undifferentiated/crypt and differentiated/villus iecs express distinct repertoires of integrins   <cit> . particularly, undifferentiated iecs predominantly express α2β <dig>  α5β <dig> and α6β4ctd-, whereas differentiated ones predominantly express α3β <dig> and α6β <dig>  <cit> . herein, we report that differentiated iecs exhibit a greater sensitivity to anoikis than undifferentiated ones. this implicates an earlier onset of anoikis when kept in suspension, as well as significantly greater contributions from β <dig> and β <dig> integrins in the suppression of anoikis in differentiated cells, and functional distinctions between β <dig> and β <dig> integrins in engaging both fak and src, or src only, respectively. accordingly, fak performs significantly greater contributions in the suppression of anoikis in differentiated cells. we also show that α2β <dig> and α5β <dig> suppress anoikis in undifferentiated cells, whereas α3β <dig> does so in differentiated ones . furthermore, we provide evidence that α6β4ctd-, which is expressed in undifferentiated iecs and is non-functional for anchorage  <cit> , contributes nevertheless to the suppression of anoikis in a primarily α <dig> subunit-dependent manner. additionally, we show that α6β <dig>  which is expressed in differentiated cells and is anchorage-functional  <cit> , not only performs significantly greater contributions than its anchorage non-functional counterpart in the suppression of anoikis, but does so through a dependence on both of its subunits . hence, the suppression of human iec anoikis implicates differentiation state-selective repertoires of integrins, which in turn results into distinctions in anoikis regulation, and sensitivity, between undifferentiated and differentiated iecs.

our present study, coupled with our previous observations regarding human iec survival and anoikis  <cit> , now firmly establish that differentiated/villus cells are more sensitive to anoikis than their undifferentiated/crypt counterparts. such differentiation state-associated distinctions likely constitute a major physiological underpinning for the process of exfoliation-by-anoikis of obsolete iecs, upon them reaching the apex of villi  <cit> . this could also account for the observations that mechanical/shearing forces in the intestine occasionally cause incidental anoikis in villus cells only  <cit> . to this effect, our findings herein that β <dig> and α6β <dig> integrins selectively contribute to the suppression of iec anoikis according to the state of differentiation, in correlation with the differential expression profiles of these same integrins  exhibited by crypt and villus cells  <cit> , identify integrins as the main functional determinants for such differentiation state-associated sensitivity to anoikis. this is further supported by the observations that differentiated iecs are more sensitive to the inhibition  of β <dig>  α <dig>  and β <dig> . additionally, integrin-mediated cell polarization and actin organization confer greater sensitivity to anoikis  <cit> , and differentiated/villus iecs are highly polarized in sharp contrast to their poorly polarized undifferentiated/crypt counterparts  <cit> . in a similar vein, α6β4-mediated hemidesmosome formation and intermediate filament organization likewise confer greater anoikis sensitivity  <cit> , <cit> , whereby the anchorage functional α6β4-expressing villus cells bear type ii hemidesmosomes, and the anchorage non-functional α6β4ctd--expressing crypt cells lack hemidesmosomes altogether  <cit> . however, it is noteworthy that some integrins may not suppress anoikis, as one would expect  <cit> , but rather sensitize cells to the process  <cit> . for instance, it was shown recently that α8β <dig> is expressed in undifferentiated/crypt iecs , and that the knockdown of the α <dig> subunit not only fails to impact negatively on the survival of these cells, but actually confers a measure of anoikis resistance to them  <cit> . thus, much remains to be understood of the regulatory determinants that confer differentiation state-associated distinctions in anoikis suppression and sensitivity, including individual integrins themselves.

it is recognized that cell survival and death implicate regulatory determinants that are distinct according not only to the species and tissue, but also to the state of cell differentiation  <cit> . so far, this concept has been largely verified in the human intestinal epithelium  <cit> . for instance, iecs exhibit differentiation state-distinct expression profiles of anti- and pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> homologs, said profiles being established during the differentiation process  <cit> . additionally, the expression of individual bcl- <dig> homologs is subjected to regulatory mechanisms that are specific according to the differentiation status of iecs  <cit> . such concept of differentiation state-distinct modulations of cell survival and apoptosis inherently suggests that the regulation of anoikis likewise implicates differentiation state-specific determinants  <cit> . in the particular case of human iecs, several lines of evidence now support this. as already highlighted above, human iecs display differentiation state-related distinctions in anoikis sensitivity, and this is associated with a differentiation state-selective implication of integrins in the regulation of anoikis. to that effect, the expression profiles of individual bcl- <dig> homologs are affected distinctively according to the state of differentiation, following induction of anoikis by maintaining iecs in suspension  <cit> . additionally, differentiated cells exhibit lower relative levels of activated fak than undifferentiated ones and, consequently, are more sensitive to its inhibition . in this respect, fak impacts in a differentiation state-distinct manner on the expression of individual bcl- <dig> homologs  <cit> . although the relative levels of activated src are similar between undifferentiated and differentiated cells, and consequently show similar sensitivities to its inhibition , src nonetheless impacts distinctively on the individual expression of bcl- <dig> homologs according to the state of differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, we have previously reported that although the integrin/fak/src engagement of the mek/erk pathway is primarily src-dependent regardless of the state of human iec differentiation, this same pathway plays a marginal role  in the suppression of anoikis in undifferentiated cells, as opposed to its substantial roles to that effect in differentiated ones  <cit> . similarly, isoforms of the pi3-k/akt pathway perform differentiation state-distinct roles in the integrin/fak/src-mediated regulation of anoikis, in relation to their selective engagement by fak, or src, and again according to the differentiation status of human iecs  <cit> . lastly, we have previously demonstrated that the integrin/fak/src-mediated suppression of anoikis in human iecs includes the inhibition of the pro-apoptotic activation of p38βsapk and p38δsapk in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, respectively  <cit> . hence, taking into account that similar lines of evidence have been mounting from studies in other cell types  <cit> , it is now clear that the integrin-mediated control of anoikis is not only tissue type- and species context-dependent, but also differentiation state-selective.

in this respect, our observations that the inhibition of src does not impact on the activation of fak in undifferentiated cells while resulting in fak’s down-activation in differentiated ones , coupled to those that show a dependence on fak for src’s activation regardless of the state of differentiation , are strongly suggestive of a differentiation state-distinct crosstalk between fak and src with regards to their respective activation . signaling by β <dig> integrins is typically initiated by the recruitment and activation of fak at the cytoplasmic tail of the β subunit. in turn, fak recruits and activates src  <cit> , <cit> . conversely, src may be first to be engaged, and then recruit/activate fak  <cit> . although recent studies point to the identity of individual integrins specifically involved, as well to the intervention of integrin-associated cytoplasmic molecules such as paxillin, talin or filamin, much remains to be understood of the determinants that dictate the order of engagement of fak and src, as well as in defining their mutual dependence  for their activation  <cit> .

on a related note, it is intriguing that the inhibition of β <dig> integrins leads to the down-activation of fak and src, along with a consequent drop in functional fak-src interactions, whereas the inhibition of α <dig> and/or β <dig> down-activates src without affecting fak, or fak-src interactions, regardless of the state of iec differentiation . while these observations fall in line with the current understanding that α6β4-mediated signaling engages src, whereas that of β <dig> integrins engages both fak and src  <cit> , <cit> , these nonetheless suggest the existence of separate, functional pools of src in human iecs – namely one engaged by β <dig> integrins/fak, and the other engaged by α6β4ctd-/α6β <dig> . the existence of spatially and functionally compartmentalized intracellular pools of signaling molecules is now well recognized  <cit> . incidentally, two other separate pools of src, likewise involved in the regulation of cell survival and/or anoikis, have been previously identified in iecs: one associated with e-cadherin junctional complexes  <cit> , and one associated with rtk signaling  <cit> . in the case of the former, it remains to be fully understood how e-cadherin-mediated src signaling may crosstalk with that of integrins   <cit> . in the case of the latter, it is already established that extensive crosstalk occurs between integrins and rtks in the regulation of virtually all known cell processes, often through src  <cit> . therefore, further studies are warranted in order to better understand the underpinnings of the crosstalk between fak and distinct functional pools of src, particularly with regards to the roles of such crosstalk in the regulation of anoikis.

another finding in the present study is that the α6β <dig> integrin expressed in undifferentiated iecs, which is non-functional for anchorage and/or hemidesmosome formation  <cit> , contributes nevertheless to the suppression of anoikis and does so primarily in an α6-dependent manner . by contrast, the α6β <dig> integrin expressed in differentiated iecs not only enacts significantly greater contributions than its anchorage non-functional counterpart in the suppression of anoikis, but does so through a dependence on its two subunits . considering that this integrin is functional for both anchorage and hemidesmosome formation  <cit> , it is therefore not surprising that differentiated iecs are more sensitive to its inhibition , or that its allosteric activation corresponds to the classical requirement of both α and β subunits for integrin functionality and signaling  <cit> . incidentally, human iecs express the mrna-splicing cytoplasmic domain-variants α6a and α6b, whereby undifferentiated/crypt cells express α6aβ4ctd- and differentiated/villus cells express α6bβ <dig>  <cit> . to that effect, α6aβ4ctd- has been shown to promote proliferation in undifferentiated/crypt iecs  <cit> . hence, our observations that α6β4ctd- engages src, and thus contributes to anoikis suppression in undifferentiated iecs, constitutes an additional instance of cell process-implication capacity for this integrin variant. interestingly, the forced over-expression of α6b in undifferentiated iecs leads to their growth arrest  <cit> . considering our observations regarding the α6-dependence for α6β4ctd- in engaging src and suppressing anoikis in undifferentiated cells, as well as the emerging evidence of signaling abilities by the α <dig> integrin subunit  <cit> , these data altogether raise further the question of the variant-specific roles for α6a and α6b in iec processes – including in the suppression of anoikis.

lastly, although our use of binding activity-blocking antibodies allowed for the discrimination of the impacts of the inhibition of a given integrin subunit between undifferentiated and differentiated iecs, these same biological tools did not allow for a similar discrimination between the individual integrin subunits analyzed. this is simply due to the inherent variability of efficiency between the specific antibodies used. as examples, while we were able to conclude with confidence that the inhibition of α2β <dig> contributes to anoikis suppression in undifferentiated cells only, it remains inconclusive whether β <dig> integrins perform the greater roles in anoikis suppression than β <dig> ones, or that α5β <dig> is more important than α2β <dig> in the suppression of anoikis in undifferentiated cells.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has provided evidence that distinctions in anoikis susceptibility, between undifferentiated/crypt and differentiated/villus iecs, implicate differentiation state-selective repertoires of β <dig> and α6β <dig> integrins , which result into differentiation state-distinctions in the overall regulation of human iec anoikis . in this respect, the present findings altogether provide further functional understanding of the concept that cell survival and suppression of anoikis are subjected to differentiation state-selective mechanisms. additionally, we specifically identify the α2β <dig>  α5β <dig>  and α6β4ctd- integrins as determinants of anoikis regulation in undifferentiated iecs, as well as α3β <dig> and α6β <dig> as comparable determinants in differentiated ones. however, these findings in no way exclude similar implications for other integrins  that are expressed by human iecs  <cit> . further studies, along with the present findings, should provide a greater understanding of the inherent complexities of the integrin-mediated modulation of anoikis not only within the context of normal tissue homeostasis, but also within the physiopathological context of tissue dysfunction.
