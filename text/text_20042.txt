BACKGROUND
kentucky bluegrass  is a prominent cool-season perennial grass used as a turf amenity grass and as forage for livestock. it is a member of the poa genus, including a range of high polyploid and facultative apomictic plants and populations  <cit> . as a turfgrass with a strong rhizomatous growth habit, kentucky bluegrass is used in sports fields, golf course roughs and fairways, residential lawns, roadsides, and public parks. many of these locations are accompanied by high salinity in soils or water, which imposes stress on the turf. high seasonal water tables that evaporate over the growing season in semi-arid environments increase the salinity levels in soils  <cit> . salt water intrusions occur in coastal regions, roadsides receive substantial amounts of salt during winter de-icing, and increasing water restrictions in dry climates cause municipalities to use effluent water in landscape irrigation with higher concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts  <cit> . among cool-season  turfgrasses, kentucky bluegrass is relatively intolerant of salinity stress  <cit> . however, previous evaluations of kentucky bluegrass germplasm detected significant variation within the species for salinity tolerance .

within the turfgrasses, salt stress causes a cessation of growth, leaf tip firing, negative leaf water potentials, a decrease in turf quality and functionality, and potentially plant death . the mechanisms of plant salt tolerance include the exclusion of root salt uptake, osmotic adjustment, and compartmentalization or exclusion of na+ from above ground tissues  <cit> . within kentucky bluegrass, turf quality under salt stress was correlated with higher shoot and root growth, high relative water contents, and photochemical efficiency  <cit> . additionally, although the actual physiological mechanisms are unknown, salt tolerance has been associated with foliar aba application, antioxidant enzyme activities, reduced electrolyte leakage, and the presence of non-structural carbohydrates  <cit> .

although previous studies have increased the understanding of kentucky bluegrass responses to salinity stress, and identified salt-stress indicator measurements, very little information is available about the genetic mechanisms involved in kentucky bluegrass responses to salinity stress. with no draft genome and minimal est sequences available  <cit> , and with no close relationships to other grass species that have reference genome libraries, kentucky bluegrass functional genomics studies remain at the gene discovery phase. the advent of rna-seq studies has provided powerful methods to identify gene transcripts that vary upon salinity stress  <cit> . through the identification of transcripts that vary significantly between control and salt treatment as well as between salt treated susceptible and tolerant germplasm sources, inferences can be made about which genes and genetic pathways in kentucky bluegrass play a role in salinity stress response and tolerance.

in the present study, we utilized transcriptome sequencing to identify genes induced or repressed in a kentucky bluegrass salt tolerant accession relative to a susceptible accession upon salt treatment. replications of both shoot and root tissues are examined under control and salt-stressed treatments, in both a tolerant and susceptible accession. we use a de novo assembly as a reference sequence library to map sequences and determine differential gene expression. this is the first report of kentucky bluegrass differential gene expression analysis on a transcriptome scale, and provides insight into genes and networks that contribute to salinity response, and tolerance, in this turf species.

RESULTS
biological triplicates of a previously reported salt tolerant  and a susceptible  kentucky bluegrass accession, under control and salt treatments, with shoot and root tissues separated, were sampled for transcriptome analysis. these samplings occurred 21 days after salt treatments were initiated, and one hour after the most recent salt treatment. as gene expression responses to salt stress can vary over time from the application of salt treatments  <cit> , this sampling was selected to focus on transcripts with different abundances after several weeks of salt treatment.

between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million ion torrent proton reads, with an average of  <dig> million, were obtained per sample . the read length ranged from  <dig> to 139 bp, with an average of 107 bp. a multidimensional scaling  plot of distances between average log expression values among trimmed sample replications indicated consistency among genotypes, tissues, and replications within treatments . the first dimension separated shoot from root tissue samples, while the second separated control from salt treated samples. the separation of control and salt treated groups for the  <dig> samples was more pronounced than  <dig> sample groups. the lesser separation among  <dig> replicate groups relative to  <dig> replicate groups may have occurred if fewer  <dig> genes were differentially expressed compared to  <dig>  or if the  <dig> samples were more genetically variable than the  <dig> samples. as both of these accessions are highly apomictic , and  <dig> had higher  standard deviations upon salt stress than  <dig> in a previous study  <cit> , the lesser separation within  <dig> replicate groups more likely resulted from fewer genes responding to salt stress rather than lower inherent variation.table  <dig>

trimmed sequencing reads from both accessions and all samples were used to make a de novo reference assembly, resulting in  <dig>  transcripts. the high number of transcripts in the assembly resulted from the combination of two genotypes that were included in the assembly, the high mixed auto- and allo-polyploidy of poa pratensis, and the apomictic breeding system of poa pratensis with its high and fixed heterozygosity  <cit> . the n <dig> of this assembly was 358 bp, the average length 360 bp, and the maximum transcript assembly length was 8849 bp.

a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were detected; with  <dig>  from shoot tissues and  <dig>  from root tissues. these differentially expressed transcripts were identified from four pairwise comparisons:  <dig> salt treated vs. control,  <dig> salt treated vs. control,  <dig> control vs.  <dig> control, and  <dig> salt treated vs.  <dig> salt treated samples . consistent with the mds plot, fewer differentially expressed transcripts were detected in the tolerant  <dig> salt treated vs. control samples  when compared to the susceptible  <dig> salt treated vs. control samples . additionally, the  <dig> salt treated vs.  <dig> salt treated comparison had almost double the number of differentially expressed transcripts compared to the  <dig> control vs.  <dig> control comparison; highlighting a widening difference in gene expression responses between these two genotypes upon salt stress imposition.fig.  <dig> venn diagram of the numbers of differentially expressed transcripts among four pairwise comparisons from shoot  and root  tissue comparisons. pi  <dig>  is a salt susceptible and pi  <dig>  a salt tolerant kentucky bluegrass genotype. st = salt treatment of  <dig> ds/m saline solution while c = control treatment of  <dig> ds/m solution. sample groups in dark gray and light gray represent transcripts unlikely to contribute to tolerance; and groups in white include transcripts with possible roles in the salt tolerance of 742



for both shoot and root tissues, several groups of transcripts shown in the venn diagrams were unlikely to contribute to salt tolerance in the  <dig> accession. transcripts specific to each individual comparisons  reflected an absence of responses among any other comparison, and were thus removed from further analysis. venn groups shown in light gray  were transcripts with profiles that varied between  <dig> and  <dig> backgrounds but were not induced or repressed by salt stress, which would require further genotypes to infer a role in salt tolerance. also shown in light gray were transcripts that exhibited similar responses in both  <dig> and  <dig> upon salt treatment. these groups of transcripts were also removed from further analysis. the remaining venn groups , which included  <dig> transcripts from shoots and  <dig> from roots, possessed expression profiles with the potential to be associated with salt tolerance in the  <dig> accession. of those shoot differentially expressed transcripts, 77 % had blastx hits and 69 % had go terms associated with previously reported sequences. for root transcripts, 74 % had blastx hits and 64 % had associated go terms. although no close relative with substantial sequence information available exists for poa pratensis, hordeum vulgare and other triticeae species, along with brachypodium distachyon, had the highest proportion of top hits to poa pratensis transcripts. the transcript identifiers and normalized expression values of these differentially expressed transcripts of potential interest are listed in additional files  <dig> and 2: tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

previous reports proposed that salt sensitive and salt tolerant species share the same genes involved in their response to salt stress, but that tolerant species either contain more effective alleles of the genes or implement the genes in a more effective manner to reduce salt stress  <cit> . consistent with this hypothesis, the percentages of transcripts in the different go functional groups in our study were similar  and not inconsistent with ion or osmotic stressed studies  <cit> . furthermore, we conducted enrichment tests of go terms between the  <dig> salt treated vs. control and the  <dig> salt treated vs. control comparisons, and found few go terms enriched between  <dig> and  <dig> in either root or shoot datasets . in shoot tissues, sequences involved in n-terminal protein lipidation processes were enriched in  <dig> samples relative to  <dig> samples, suggesting an increased need to transport modified proteins to membranes to adjust for osmotic stress  <cit> . in root tissues, sequences with endonuclease and alpha-glucosidase activity were enriched in  <dig> samples while sequences in the cytoplasmic and intracellular components were enriched in  <dig> samples. interestingly, several go terms were present in roots but not shoots, and vice versa . shoot tissues included sequences in the symplast cellular component while roots did not, suggesting that roots exhibited tighter control of water and solute movement in both accessions. in the molecular function go category, shoots also included sequences with structural molecule activity while roots included sequences with electron carrier activity . in particular the electron carrier activity detected in roots through go terms may point to its role in generating transmembrane electrochemical gradients in response to elevated levels of salt.fig.  <dig> percentage of transcripts ascribed with go level <dig> terms for cellular component, biological process, and molecular function for shoot  and root  tissues in pi  <dig>  and pi  <dig>  kentucky bluegrass accessions. c = control while st = salt- treated

from the prioritized venn groups , transcripts were further extracted with expression values that were  consistently induced in  <dig> salt treated vs. control,  <dig> salt treated vs. control, and  <dig> salt treated vs.  <dig> salt treated;  consistently repressed in the same three comparisons; or  contrasting in  <dig> responses upon salt treatment compared to  <dig>  these comparisons yielded  <dig> transcripts from shoot tissues and  <dig> from root tissues. only  <dig> of those differentially expressed transcripts were shared between both tissues, highlighting tissue specific genetic mechanisms for salt response. the transcript abundances, p-values, annotations, and go terms for these transcripts in both tissues are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> .

root tissue
few genes such as transcription factors, oxidative stress response genes, or ion transporters have been reported as induced upon salt stress in roots of salt-sensitive species, relative to above-ground plant tissues  <cit> . of these genes however, transcription factors can activate downstream stress-response effectors  <cit> . in this study, bzip, myb, ap <dig>  wrky, and nac and homeobox transcription factors were extracted out of the venn groups of interest  using an hmm search as well as go biological process terms of ‘regulation of transcription.’ ten transcripts were detected . a senescence associated transcription factor, wrky <dig>  hox <dig>  and a bzip transcription factor were down-regulated in  <dig> while two myb, three homeobox, and a zinc finger transcription factor were up-regulated in  <dig>  the myb-like gene mybas <dig>  up-regulated in both  <dig> and  <dig> but expressed at a higher level in  <dig>  is homologous to a splice variant of atmyb <dig>  <cit>  that represses root cell growth and elongation  <cit> . the knotted- <dig> homeobox transcription factor can also function as a negative repressor of meristematic growth  <cit> . this apparent down-regulation of root growth suggests a possible method by which  <dig> may be tolerating salt; by slowing its root elongation into saline soil areas to avoid uptake of excess sodium. alternatively, tolerance may also be improved through a kinase signalling cascade, possibly mediated by the a20/an <dig> zinc finger factor  <cit>  or other myb transcripts  <cit> .fig.  <dig> log expression values of root and shoot transcripts related to regulation of transcription processes. c = control treatment, st = salt treatment. pi  <dig>  is the susceptible accession while pi  <dig>  is the salt-tolerant accession. red colours indicate high relative expression while green indicates low relative expression



terrestrial plants generally share the same small complement of ion transporters  <cit> . several transporters have been implicated in movement of salt from the soil into the root zone, in movement of sodium out of the xylem or phloem to prevent shoot accumulation, in movement of sodium from the cytosol into the extracellular matrix, or movement from the cytosol to vacuoles  <cit> . in this study’s root samples, transcripts with biological process terms of ‘transmembrane transport’, ‘ion transport’, and ‘water transport’ were extracted from the venn groups of interest  and exhibited variable expression profiles in  <dig> salt treated samples . of eleven extracted transcripts, an aquaporin, cation antiporter, and calcium-transporting atpase were down-regulated, suggesting a reduction in water and ion transport into the roots in response to osmotic stress to reduce sodium influx. two carbohydrate related transporters, a manganese transporter, and a v-type proton atpase subunit were up-regulated in  <dig> fig.  <dig> log expression values of root and shoot transcripts related to ion and transmembrane transport activity biological processes. c = control treatment, st = salt treatment. pi  <dig>  is the susceptible accession while pi  <dig>  is the salt-tolerant accession. red colours indicate high relative expression while green indicates low relative expression



reactive oxygen species are naturally produced during photosynthesis and respiration  <cit> , but are induced upon salt stress in plants  <cit> . transcripts involved in the ‘oxidation-reduction process’ and ‘response to oxidative stress’ biological process terms were extracted from the venn groups of interest . seventeen transcripts were down-regulated in  <dig> salt treated samples relative to other samples , including all the peroxidases and a cytochrome p <dig>  although peroxidases are common enzymes for detoxifying reactive oxygen species in plants, their reduced transcript abundances indicate that they were not functioning in that role in kentucky bluegrass. four transcripts were up-regulated in  <dig>  including a glutathione-s-transferase, a glutamate synthase, and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase . each of these up-regulated genes can be induced upon abiotic stress, and are likely to be involved in detoxification of the deleterious oxidative stress compounds .fig.  <dig> log expression values of root and shoot transcripts related to oxidation-reduction biological processes. c = control treatment, st = salt treatment. pi  <dig>  is the susceptible accession while pi  <dig>  is the salt-tolerant accession. red colours indicate high relative expression while green indicates low relative expression



other transcripts within the venn groups of interest , which were up- or down-regulated in both  <dig> and  <dig> upon salt treatment but induced to a greater degree in  <dig>  or contrastingly regulated between  <dig> and  <dig> , were detected. these included transcripts with homology to genes with kinase activity, fructan biosynthesis, endonuclease activity, and genes without homology based annotations. interestingly, most of these were down-regulated in  <dig> .

shoot tissue
similar to root tissue studies, bzip, myb, ap <dig>  wrky, nac, homeobox, and other transcription factors were extracted out of the shoot-expressing venn groups of interest . of  <dig> transcripts detected, seven were down-regulated; including auxin responsive iaa <dig> and arf <dig> genes and an ethylene response factor . these two auxin responsive genes may form heterodimers to exert signalling effects  <cit> . erf transcription factors play roles in abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> , but the up-regulation in the susceptible  <dig> and the down-regulation in the tolerant  <dig> suggests that this transcription factor may rather be signalling genes that respond to salt stress and not tolerate the stress. eight transcripts were up-regulated, including a col <dig> homolog that can function to delay flowering by repressing the expression of co  <cit> , and an ap2-erebp transcription factor homolog that may be involved in multiple abiotic stress responses  <cit> . interestingly, another auxin response factor  was up-regulated in  <dig>  highlighting specific and varied roles of auxin mediated responses to salt stress in these samples.

shoot transcripts with biological process terms of ‘transmembrane transport’, ‘ion transport’, and ‘water transport’ were extracted from the venn groups of interest . eighteen transport-related transcripts were extracted, and unlike the root tissue transport transcripts there were more up-regulated transcripts in the shoot tissues in  <dig> than there were down-regulated transcripts. three aquaporins were differentially expressed in the shoot tissues; one down-regulated and two up-regulated in  <dig>  the aquaporin nip2- <dig> was down-regulated in both shoots and roots, which may contribute to a tolerant plant’s reduction in hydraulic conductivity following salt imposition, or play a role in stomatal conductance  <cit> . the v-type atpase subunit, induced in shoot tissue of  <dig> but also induced in root tissues, provides a capability for cells to maintain ph and power vacuolar sequestration of sodium ions  <cit> . along with the vacuolar cation proton exchanger  <cit> , tip genes, the v-type atpase induced transcripts could provide for more efficient sequestration of sodium ions into the vacuoles in tolerant  <dig> plants upon salt stress.

shoot transcripts involved in the ‘oxidation-reduction process’ and ‘response to oxidative stress’ biological process terms were extracted from shoot-expressing venn groups of interest. forty-one transcripts involved in these oxidoreductase processes were extracted, with approximately half up- and half down-regulated in the  <dig> salt treated samples . similar to root tissues, several common antioxidant enzyme families such as peroxidases and laccases were down-regulated in the tolerant  <dig>  these would not be candidates for gene introgression to improve salt tolerance in more susceptible kentucky bluegrass varieties. other common antioxidant enzyme families included both up- and down-regulated gene members; such as cytochrome p450s, ferritins, and genes involved in polyphenol biosynthesis and metabolism. transcripts induced in  <dig> included well characterized antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase  <cit> , thioredoxin, g3pdh, and a protochlorophyllide gene. some of these induced transcripts, such as superoxide dismutase and thioredoxin, were also detected in a barley study after 21 days of salt treatment  <cit> .

other transcripts within the venn groups of interest  were also up- or down-regulated in  <dig> salt treated samples . several transcripts homologous to kinases, endonucleases, and heat shock proteins were detected, as well as many transcripts with no homology-based annotations.

CONCLUSIONS
these data represent the first rna-seq analysis of the glycophytic kentucky bluegrass, and provide gene candidates for tolerance to salt stress in this turfgrass species. between shoot and root tissues, over  <dig> transcripts with expression profiles consistent with conferring tolerance in the  <dig> accession were detected. by categorizing expression profiles into groups of transcripts that may contribute to salt tolerance in the  <dig> accessions, genes involved as transcription factors, water and ion transport processes, and oxidation-reduction processes, promising genes for further functional testing were identified and genetic mechanisms specific to kentucky bluegrass under this treatment were inferred. as this experiment was treated for 21 days prior to sampling, most evanescent gene expression changes, including those that accommodate the initial osmotic and ionic shocks  <cit> , would have returned to homeostasis and not be detected in this study. gene families in those evanescent categories may include the peroxidases, ferretin, and cyp <dig>  as they were either down-regulated or contained multiple gene family members with varying expression profiles. additionally, in root tissues, ion and water transporting transcripts were predominantly down-regulated possibly to adjust for osmotic differences from the saline water in the soils  <cit> .

several transcriptions factors induced both in shoot and root tissues showed expression patterns consistent with roles in salt stress response, and their differential expression in pi  <dig> suggests a role in conferring salt tolerance. additionally, shoot vacuolar transporting transcripts were up-regulated to facilitate sequestration of sodium ions, and several oxidation-reduction process genes were detected in shoots that may help attenuate oxidative stress. although further functional testing in a broader array of poa pratensis germplasm is necessary to confirm a wider scope of inference in their roles in salt tolerance, these genes provide a deeper understanding of which mechanisms in poa pratensis roots and shoots respond to, and tolerate, salinity stress.
