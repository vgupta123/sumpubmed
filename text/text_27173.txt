BACKGROUND
complex cellular structures such as molecular construction of a cell can be studied by fluorescence microscopy images of cells with appropriate stains. robotic systems nowadays can automatically acquire thousands of images from cell assays, which are often referred as being "high-content" for the large amount of information. these images reflect the biological properties of the cell with many features, including size, shape, amount of fluorescent label, dna content, cell cycle, and cell morphology. with interdisciplinary efforts from computer science and biology, scientists are now able to carry out large-scale screening of cellular phenotypes, at whole-cell or sub-cellular levels, which are important in many applications, e.g., delineating cellular pathways, drug target validation and even cancer diagnosis  <cit> .

from the high-throughput screening, biologists can also greatly benefit in further understanding the complex cellular processes and genetic functions  <cit> . for example, a gene's normal operations in the cell can be assessed by observing the downstream effect of perturbing gene expression  <cit> . by introduction of double-stranded rna  into a diverse range of organisms and cell types, the complementary mrna can be degraded, a phenomenon known as rna interference   <cit> . the discovery of rnai and the availability of whole genome sequences allow the systematic knockdown of every gene or specific gene sets in a genome  <cit> . image-based screening of the entire genome for specific cellular functions thus becomes feasible by the development of drosophila rnai technology to systematically disrupt gene expression  <cit> . genome-wide screens, however, produce huge volumes of image data which is beyond human's capability of manual analysis, and automating the analysis of the large number of images generated in such screening is the bottleneck in realizing the full potential of cellular and molecular imaging studies.

to advance the development of high content screening  for genome analysis, computer vision and pattern analysis techniques have to be resorted to characterize morphological phenotypes quantitatively and to identify genes and their dynamic relationships on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . such a bio-image informatics framework would consist of several components: cellular segmentation, cellular morphology and image feature extraction, cellular phenotype classification, and clustering analysis  <cit> . in this article, our effort is made toward further investigating the challenging multi-class phenotype classification problem from microscopy images by using benchmarking fluorescence microscopy images  <cit> .

with appropriate cellular segmentation results, phenotype recognition can be studied in a multi-class classification framework, which involves two interweaved components: feature representation and classification. efficient and discriminative image representation is a fundamental issue in any bioimage recognition tasks. most of the proposed approaches for image-based high-content screening employed feature set which consist of different combinations of morphological, edge, texture, geometric, moment and wavelet features  <cit> . in recent years, computer science has seen much progresses in the development of various efficient image feature description methods, many of which have become "off-the-shelf" standard techniques applicable to bioimages analysis. in this paper, we will show that the curvelet transform  <cit>  outperform many other known feature descriptions for the cellular images. based on the latest research achievements on multiresolution analysis for image, curvelet transform can accurately capture edge information by taking the form of basis elements which exhibit very high directional sensitivity and are highly anisotropic. it has been shown that curvelet is well suited for representing images which are rich of edge information and the efficiency has been demonstrated in many tasks  <cit> .

to our knowledge, there is no previous work discussing the use of curvelet transform in fluorescence microscope images except  <cit>  which applied curvelet for denoising. the research presented in this paper is to investigate the application of curvelet on microscope images based phenotype recognition, and compare it with the application of wavelets. the simple statistics of mean and standard deviation from multiscale curvelet transform coefficients are extracted and evaluated as the basic curvelet features. on the other hand, due to the proven effectiveness of the traditional haralick features  <cit>  for extracting texture information, and in microscope images of biological cells in particular  <cit> , we proposed to form a combined image description from the curvelet transform and haralick features. haralick feature is based on gray-level spatial dependencies using a gray level co-occurrence matrix  that measures the frequency that a particular gray level is found adjacent to another gray level. by complementarily combining the advantages of each feature description method, the classification performance can be considerably enhanced.

machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks and support vector machine  have been utilized for the classification of subcellular protein location patterns with fluorescence microscope images  <cit> . multi-class phenotype images, however, are often featured with large intra-class variations and inter-class similarities, which poses serious problems for simultaneous multi-class separation using the standard classifiers. and other rate-limiting factors challenging classifier design is that the dimension of the feature space is often larger than the number of training examples per class. in recent years, many sophisticated learning paradigms have been proposed to design accurate and robust classification systems. among them, ensemble learning has attracted much attention due to the promising results for many applications. an ensemble of classifiers integrates multiple base classifiers such as multiple layer perceptrons  using a same learning algorithm  <cit> . among the representatives of ensemble learning, random subspace method   <cit>  is an efficient way to create ensemble of classifiers. rsm divides the entire space of features into subspaces and each subspace is formed by randomly picking features from the entire space, allowing for features to be repeated across subspaces. in this paper, we propose to construct and evaluate a random subspace classifier ensemble with multiple layer perceptron as the base classifier, using the combined features from curvelet transform and haralick features.

RESULTS
three image sets hela, cho and rnai from the iicbu benchmarking data  <cit>  were evaluated. all of the images are processed as wholes without any detection or segmentation. in our experiments, a simple holdout methodology was applied. for each of the three image sets, we randomly split it into training and test sets, each time with 20% of each class's images reserved for testing while the rest for training. the classification results are the average from  <dig> runs, such that each run used a random split of the data to training and test sets.

our first set of experiments aims at selecting appropriate features from the curvelet transform. the simple statistics of mean and standard deviation from each band of curvelet transform have been used as efficient signatures in several applications  <cit> . rather than theoretical analysis of the distribution properties of curvelet transform coefficients for the cell images, we conducted empirical analysis for the usefulness to include other statistics into the feature vectors, for example, energy, entropy, skewness and kurtosis. to determine the discriminating power from different combinations of these statistics as the image features, we compared the classification performance from the following candidate curvelet feature vectors. in addition to the basic signature of mean and standard deviation , other sets of statistics were calculated and added to the basic signature in turn, including norm, energy, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. the results were reported in figure  <dig>  while the addition of variance or energy slightly increase the classification accuracy for the hela images, the inclusion of entropy clearly outperform other kind of combinations for both of the cho and rnai images.

the discriminating strengths of the feature vectors from glcm  <cit> , daubechies wavelet  <cit> , gabor wavelet  <cit>  and curvelet transform  <cit>  were compared using three-layer perceptron  neural network, which has the number of inputs same as the number of features, one hidden layer with  <dig> units and linear units representing the class labels . the networks are trained using the conjugate gradient learning algorithm for  <dig> epochs. figure  <dig> illustrates the comparison of accuracies for each of the three image sets from glcm, daubechies wavelet, gabor wavelet, and curvelet feature descriptors. for all of the three image sets, the curvelet descriptors clearly outperforms all other descriptors. specifically, for hela, cho and rnai images, the classification accuracies from curvelet features are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, which compares favorably over the results from glcm features  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and 86%. among the four different features compared, the curvelet features also consistently demonstrates the superiority over gabor wavelet and daubechies wavelet, which were in fact expected since the curvelet transform is able to capture the multi-dimensional features in wedges as opposed to points in wavelet transforms. the multidirectional features in curvelets prove to be very effective in the classification of microscopy cell images which often demonstrate piece-wise smooth with rich edge information. the best classification accuracies for all of the three image sets were from the aggregated features by simply concatenating curvelet and glcm, namely, hela  <dig> %, cho  <dig> % and rnai  <dig> % respectively. the benefit of applying them in an integrative way is due to the fact that glcm and curvelet transform features emphasize texture and edge or piece-wise smooth characteristics of image differently. as expected, the combination of both features from glcm and curvelet transform produces a higher accuracy than the methods being used singly, as shown in figure  <dig> 

we proceeded to evaluate several different but commonly used supervised learning methods to the multi-class phenotype classification problem, including k-nearest neighbors , multi-layer perceptron neural networks, svm and random forest, using the above three image sets. the feature vector for each image is calculated from the sub-bands of curvelet transform . we simply chose k =  <dig> for knn in the comparisons. mlp is the same as used in the above experiment. designing svm classifiers  <cit>  includes selecting the proper kernel function and choosing the appropriate kernel parameters and c value. the popular library for svm, libsvm http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm, was used in the experiment. we used the radial basis function kernel for the svm classifier. the parameter γ that defines the spread of the radial function was set to be  <dig>  and parameter c that defines the trade-off between the classifier accuracy and the margin  to be  <dig> . a random forest  classifier  <cit>  consists of many decision trees and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes output by individual trees. in the comparison experiments, the number of trees for random forest classifier was chosen as  <dig> and the number of variables to be randomly selected from the available set of variables was selected as  <dig> 

the comparison results from applying the above four classifiers were provided in figure  <dig>  which confirmed that for each image dataset, the best result was obtained by using mlp. for rnai, the result from mlp is  <dig> %, which is better than the published result 82%  <cit> . the accuracies from other three classifiers are  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % . for 2d-hela and cho, the correct classification rates from mlps are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which are also very competitive. the results for these two datasets obtained by shamir et al. are 84% for 2d-hela and 93% for cho  <cit> . the results obtained by mlp contrast to the generally accepted perception that svm classifier is better than neural network in classification. the most reasonable explanation for the better performance of mlp from our experiment is that mlp as a memory-based classifier is more resistant to insufficient data amount comparing the margin or distance-based svm.

our next experimental study aims to demonstrate the superiority of random subspace mlp classifier ensemble over the single mlp used in the previous experiments. the holdout experiment setting is similar. to ensure the diversity among the mlps in an ensemble, the numbers of hidden units in the component networks are varied by randomly choosing them from a range of  <dig> ~ <dig>  using an ensemble of size  <dig> and 80% of original dimensionality for feature subsets, the classification results obtained for hela, cho and rnai were summarized in table  <dig>  from which one can see that for all the three image sets, the random subspace mlp ensemble does bring the improvement on the classification accuracy.

in the random subspace method, there are two important parameters that have to be considered. the first is the ensemble size l, which is the number of base classifiers in the ensemble. the second is the dimensionality of feature subsets m. recently, the selection of these two parameters has been addressed in the classification of brain images of fmri  <cit>  and text categorization  <cit> , which shows that relatively medium m and small l yield an ensemble that could improve the performance. our next experiment assessed the effect of ensemble size for the phenotype image classifications. we first varied the sizes of the ensembles from  <dig> components mlps to  <dig>  with fixed feature subspace dimensionality  <dig>  which account for 80% of combined features' dimension. the same experiment procedure described above was repeated. the results of the averaged classification accuracies in table  <dig> shows that there are no real benefits of forming very large ensembles. in the case of rnai, the maximum accuracy  <dig> % is reached with size  <dig>  beyond which there is no improvement in performance. in the cases of hela and cho, size  <dig> seems to be sufficient for the much increased classification accuracies comparing to the results in  <cit> . beyond size  <dig>  larger ensemble size may bring quite marginal improvement for the cho images at the cost of heavy computational burden in the training phase.

to answer the question how the dimensionality of feature subsets m influence the classification performance of rsm, we compared the rsm classification performances for the three image sets by varying subspace dimensionalities. for original  <dig> dimensional combined features, selection of 55% features means  <dig> dimensionality and so on. with  <dig> component mlps in the ensemble, the comparison results are given in table  <dig>  which indicates that satisfactory results are obtained with medium ms. for the rnai data, maximum  <dig> % classification rate is reached with selection of 80% of original features . for the hela and cho image sets, the largest accuracies  <dig> % and  <dig> % are from selecting 75% and 85% of original features , respectively.

the confusion matrices that summarize the details of the above random subspace ensemble for the three image sets are given in the following tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the confusion matrix representation, the rows and columns indicate true and predicted class, respectively. the diagonal entries represent correct classification while the off-diagonal entries represent incorrect ones. confusion matrix is often used in the study of multi-class classification problems and to measure the similarity between classes of phenotypes  <cit> . for the hela images, the rs ensemble can well distinguish two golgi proteins, gpp <dig> and giantin, which have been shown to be very difficult to discriminate by visual inspection  <cit> . for the rnai image sets, it is apparent that among the  <dig> classes, cg <dig> type is the easiest to be correctly classified while the cg <dig> is the most difficult one. on the other hand, the resulting confused genes do not directly share the related biological mechanisms. each of these genes is associated with a different mechanism, but some pathways can be more similar to each others than others. for example, the gene cg <dig> , which leads to binucleate phenotype, is sometimes confused with gene cg <dig> , which is associated with g <dig> arrest. these two genes are more related to each other than other pairs and the confusion is often expected. however, the results from random subspace ensemble indicate that these two genes can be well distinguished without any confusion.

discussion
accurately and robustly classification of cellular phenotypes is still a challenging task in image based high-content screening. to find the best description for the microscopy images, many features extraction methods have been attempted in previous studies, but all encounter with various aspects of difficulty in dealing with various irregularities in the cellular morphology.

our motivation for overcoming this challenge is two-fold. firstly, we have attempted to demonstrate that the classification can be improved by using highly discriminative image features. this can be achieved by the utilization of the curvelet transform to extract such a feature. being similar to various wavelet transforms, the curvelet transform can capture the structural information of the images in this study at multiple scales, locations, and orientations. the major advantage is that the curvelet transform can identify the structural detail along the radial 'wedges' in the frequency domain, which is inherent in images of rich edge information. secondly, the notion of combination of multiple complementary features can further improve the classification performance. the combination of features for pattern classification has recently been embraced by the research community of image processing and pattern recognition  <cit> . however, most proposed methods for feature combination are based on optimization techniques or machine learning algorithms, which are often very complicated for practical implementation. our proposed method offers a much simpler solution by transforming multiple features into a single representation based on which the random subspace classifier ensemble can efficiently integrate different aspects of information from various random subspaces. by using this strategy, the high dimensionality problem arising from using the conventional combination of multiple features is therefore implicitly avoided.

in general, the method we have proposed in this paper can be applied to classifying and understanding complex patterns of many biological systems. the gaining of such knowledge can quickly provide life-science researchers with new insights into the changing biological behaviors in various treatment conditions, and to facilitate rapid screening and testing of new therapeutic interventions for major public health problems.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper further investigated the challenging multi-class phenotype classification problem from microscopy images. two contributions are presented. firstly, we proposed to combine two different feaures from gray level co-occurrence matrix  and curvelet transform to efficiently describe microscopy images. secondly, we examined random subspace classifier ensemble with multi-layer perceptron as the base classifier, which seem to be well-suited to the characteristics of microscopy images, as the high dimensionality of the data could be implicitly solved by randomly selecting subsets of features. experiments on three benchmarking microscopy image datasets showed that the random subspace mlp ensemble method achieved significantly higher classification accuracies , compared to the published results , which used wavelet as part of the features and a general-purpose classification scheme wnd-charm. this supports the claim that random subspace ensemble can be used as a simple yet efficient classifier design methodolody and curvelet features effectively measure the informativeness in the microscopy images.
