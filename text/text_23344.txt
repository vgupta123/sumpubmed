BACKGROUND
the number of publicly available bacterial whole genome sequences is rising exponentially  <cit> , creating a wealth of information about bacterial genetic diversity. less is known about the extent to which individual genes and gene networks contribute to bacterial fitness in a given environment—information that is valuable for understanding pathogenesis and assessing potential drug targets. next-generation sequencing  of transposon-genome junctions from a saturated transposon mutant library  allows unbiased, genome-wide measurement of the contribution to fitness of individual genes across a wide range of bacterial growth conditions, making it possible to identify essential and conditionally essential genes  <cit> .

streptococcus agalactiae  is a gram-positive bacterial species that causes serious neonatal infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis  <cit> . vertical transmission of gbs to the fetus/newborn can occur in utero in the setting of chorioamnionitis , during parturition, or postpartum  <cit> . asymptomatic colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and/or vagina occurs in 15-30 % of healthy adults . invasive disease in immunocompetent, non-pregnant, non-elderly adults has been historically rare  <cit> , although several recent reports describe a concerning rise in incidence  <cit> .

the current strategy to prevent neonatal gbs infection is to screen pregnant women for rectovaginal colonization during the third trimester and to administer intrapartum antibiotics to those women with positive screening results  <cit> . this universal screening approach has dramatically reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal gbs infection , but has had negligible impact on late-onset gbs infection  <cit> . furthermore, the current prevention approach does not aid premature babies born with established gbs infection stemming from vertical transmission in utero. these infants are often acutely ill, with multiple organ system dysfunction and poor outcomes  <cit> . improved understanding of gbs pathogenesis may allow development of refined prevention/treatment strategies.

while numerous gbs virulence factors and regulatory mechanisms have been identified , the relative contribution of specific gbs genes and interactions between genes during bacterial colonization and invasion remains incompletely defined. here we report the essential genome of gbs strain a <dig>  as determined by tn-seq. we developed and validated a vector-based transposon delivery system that we used to generate multiple unbiased mutant libraries. after statistical analysis of genome insertion sites and determination of the essential genome, genes required for growth in rich media were mapped onto biochemical and signal transduction pathways. this work represents an important step in understanding fundamental molecular interactions required for gbs survival, and provides a baseline dataset against which conditionally essential genes required for pathogenesis can be determined.

RESULTS
the modified pcam <dig> himar <dig> mini-transposon inserts at random ta sites throughout the gbs genome
our gbs mutant libraries were constructed using a himar <dig> mini-transposon previously used to generate transposon mutant libraries in gbs and related streptococcal species  <cit> . past studies that used himar1-based gbs transposon mutant libraries reported southern blot analysis demonstrating random transposon integration  <cit> . we developed pcam <dig>  a temperature-sensitive shuttle vector with an erythromycin  resistance marker within the mini-transposon that had been modified to contain the mmei sites required for tn-seq . additionally, pcam <dig> was modified from its plasmid progenitor, pcam <dig>  to correct a single base-pair deletion in the temperature-sensitive origin of replication that prevented proper function  <cit> . before subjecting a pcam48-derived gbs a <dig> mutant library to ngs analysis in a tn-seq experiment, we performed multiple quality-control steps in order to ensure that transposition had occurred as expected, that the library had been sufficiently cured of pcam <dig>  and there was widespread and random integration of our modified mini-transposon throughout the gbs genome.fig.  <dig> pcam <dig> map. pcam <dig> is a temperature-sensitive shuttle vector for delivery of a himar <dig> mini-transposon, flanked by inverted repeat  sequences modified to contain mmei restriction enzyme sites. an erythromycin resistance marker  is included within the transposon, as is the r6kγ origin of replication , which can be used for plasmid rescue . outside of the mini-transposon, the vector contains a cole <dig> origin of replication, the gram-positive temperature-sensitive replicase repa ts, in which the single-bp deletion present in pcam <dig> has been repaired, and a kanamycin resistance marker . the c <dig> himar <dig> transposase gene is under the control of the s. pyogenes m <dig> gyra promoter. restriction enzyme sites used in development and analysis of pcam <dig> are labeled



the first quality control steps involved identification of and selection for clones with the expected antibiotic resistance phenotypes suggesting a) successful transformation with pcam <dig> at 28 °c; b) selection for low-frequency transposition events at 37 °c; and c) successful curing of the plasmid after passage at 37 °c. after initial transformation of gbs a <dig> with pcam <dig> and colony growth at the permissive plasmid replication temperature , 18– <dig> individual colonies were patched onto plates with either erm or kanamycin  selection, at both the permissive  and non-permissive  temperatures. serial dilutions of candidate stocks with the correct antibiotic resistance phenotype  were plated on tryptic soy  erm media at 37 °c and ts erm + km at 28 °c in order to determine the frequency of transposition, which was between 10− <dig> and 10− <dig> in all tested libraries.

in a second quality control step, intended to insure that the eventual library stock used for tn-seq had widespread, random transposon insertion mutations with a low rate of identical insertions,  <dig> individual colonies from each of three candidate libraries were used to seed ts erm liquid cultures at 37 °c, from which genomic dna was isolated and subjected to arbitrary priming pcr . in each candidate library, appcr demonstrated uniform transposon dispersion throughout the a <dig> genome and no siblings. one mutant was revealed by appcr to have a transposon insertion in the cyle gene, whose function is required for production of the hemolytic pigment β-hemolysin/cytolysin  <cit> . this cyle knockout strain was used to confirm the appcr results using standard pcr with primers specific to the transposon and adjacent genomic dna. this strain also had the expected non-pigmented phenotype when grown in pigment-enhancing new granada media   <cit> .

tn-seq performed on biological triplicate and technical replicate libraries show reliable and reproducible genome-wide transposon insertions
we performed tn-seq with three mutant libraries that had passed the quality control steps outlined above, which were labeled a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  previous tn-seq studies using similar vector-based transposon delivery systems have reported undesirable persistence of the vector within mutant libraries, which can then be amplified during pcr of transposon-genome junctions, leading to high rates of uninformative sequencing reads that map onto the delivery vector  <cit> . in order to minimize this outcome, we subjected our libraries to an additional round of plasmid curing by plating our library stocks on 75– <dig> 150 mm × 15 mm ts erm plates, growing approximately 1x <dig> colonies for 48 h at 37 °c, then scraping those colonies from the plate to generate final glycerol library stocks. we ultimately observed low rates of vector sequence persistence , which is at or below rates observed in other tn-seq studies  <cit> .

in order to establish the feasibility of performing tn-seq with our newly developed system, we first performed a pilot experiment with the a <dig> library. we collected genomic dna at four time points  before and after a <dig> library growth in ts erm broth at 37 °c. after performing pcr amplification of transposon-genomic junctions, we undertook a limited sequencing run, generating between  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads per condition. trimming and aligning these reads to the a <dig> genome revealed, as expected, 17-nucleotide gbs-specific sequences that aligned exclusively to a <dig> genomic ta sites. however, our measured library saturation  was between  <dig> and 7 % for t0-t <dig>  furthermore, at the t <dig> time point, there was an approximately 50 % drop in saturation, similar to a finding reported by le breton et al. in their work with streptococcus pyogenes  <cit> .

following our pilot experiment, we proceeded with growth and tn-seq analysis of our three libraries, employing more sequencing reads in order to approach full detection of our libraries’ transposon saturation. as in the pilot experiment, genomic dna samples were collected prior to seeding ts erm broth at 37 °c , and at sequential 24-h time points thereafter. we decided to eliminate the t <dig> time point, however, and excluded the t <dig> pilot data from all future analyses.

our experimental design generated, in effect, a pair of technical replicates  and three pairs of biological triplicates . the essentials software package compares experimental transposon insertions to the expected number of insertions  for each gene, and reports the relationship as a logarithmic function of the experimental vs. expected insertion fold-change   <cit> . there was significant correlation between the log <dig> fc values of our technical and biological replicates , and the distribution of log <dig> fc values was, as expected, bimodal for all conditions, reflecting the lack of transposon insertions within essential genes.fig.  <dig> transposon mutant library metrics. sequential pooling of data from four t <dig> sequencing runs  demonstrates increasing unique insertion counts per gene . library transposon saturation rates  are shown for pilot and pooled datasets . essentials plots of a kernel density function of log transformed measured vs. expected transposon insertion ratios show the expected bimodal distribution separating essential from nonessential genes using pooled libraries. local minima values were used as determinants of gene essentiality at each time point . correlation of library a <dig> log <dig> fc values for each gene from the pilot and technical replicate experiments for each time point, and between the three pairs of biological triplicate libraries for t <dig>  pearson r values and two-tailed p values are listed 



tn-seq on pooled sequencing reads demonstrates a gbs a <dig> essential genome consistent with those of close relatives
satisfied that data from our three mutant libraries were comparable, we pooled the sequencing reads for each time point from our pilot and second experiments. we did this in order to maximize the measured saturation of our “master” mutant library, thereby minimizing the number of “false-positive” essential genes in our analysis. our master library had saturation values between  <dig> and 46 %, with uniform transposon distribution throughout the genome . at t <dig>  we detected  <dig>  unique transposon insertions in our master library. by t <dig>  this number had dropped to  <dig>  .

pooled reads that had been trimmed of transposon sequence were aligned to the a <dig> genome, and the subsequent bam files were used as input for essentials  <cit> . for each time point, genes with log <dig> fc below the local minimum on the corresponding density vs. log <dig> fc plot  were considered essential. final gene fitness assignments were made as follows: genes that were essential at all three time points are considered essential; genes that were essential at t <dig> and t <dig> but nonessential at t <dig> are considered critical; genes for which essentiality at any time point could not be determined or which otherwise do not meet one of the above criteria are considered undefined. using these definitions,  <dig>  % of the a <dig> genes are essential,  <dig>  % are critical, and  <dig>  % are undefined . the remaining  <dig>  % of genes are nonessential.

we sought to validate our results with independent tn-seq fitness data from a closely related but distinct species by comparing our essential and critical genes with those reported for s. pyogenes m1t <dig>  <dig> by le breton et al.  <cit> . we identified orthologous gene pairs between gbs a <dig> and s. pyogenes strain mgas <dig>  which le breton et al. used as the reference genome for m1t <dig>  <dig> fitness assignments. fitness comparisons between the two tn-seq datasets demonstrated close agreement . given that le breton’s group used a different transposon delivery system, analysis software package  <cit> , and species, and that their data set was similarly validated against tn-seq data from streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus pneumoniae, we conclude that the concordance between our fitness determinations attests to the validity of both.fig.  <dig> concordance between gbs and gas essential genes. fitness was compared between  <dig> orthologous genes of s. pyogenes m1t <dig>  <dig> and gbs a <dig>  orthologs were classified as either essential/critical  concordant, nonessential  concordant, or ec in one species and ne in the other



a <dig> essential and critical genes map to fundamental kegg pathways and signaling pathways that control essential and critical genes
we used the gene set enrichment analysis function on the genome2d webserver  <cit>  to identify a <dig> kegg pathways that were enriched for essential and critical genes. the pathways identified serve fundamental cellular housekeeping roles, such as aminoacyl-trna synthesis, glycolysis, and nucleotide metabolism . we mapped our fitness data onto regulons predicted by regprecise to be active in a <dig> based on the presence of sequences that encode known transcription factors, transcription factor binding sites, or rna-based signal transduction mechanisms  <cit> . we also assessed the fitness of two-component system genes predicted by p2cs  <cit>  .table  <dig> top kegg pathways enriched with essential/critical genes

discussion
we have developed and validated a system for performing tn-seq in gbs. functional analysis of a specific bacterial gene often depends on the ability to generate a knockout . however, a significant percentage of bacterial genes are essential for the cell’s survival  <cit> , hence unapproachable using traditional knockout techniques. until now, resources to make an a priori determination of a gbs gene’s fitness have been limited. jones et al. used signature-tagged mutagenesis in a rat sepsis model to identify gbs genes essential for virulence  <cit> . while informative, this approach—which employed inocula consisting of  <dig> pooled transposon mutants—does not permit high-resolution, genome-wide fitness scores. by harnessing the power of ngs to analyze transposon insertion frequency from a saturated and unbiased mutant library, tn-seq overcomes this limitation. our baseline fitness data should prove valuable to gbs researchers attempting to generate new knockout strains. these data also offer insights into basic gbs cell biology, delineating key pathways whose presence is necessary for in vitro survival and growth.

tn-seq data can be superimposed onto novel or existing models of cellular processes, identifying essential or critical nodes in bacterial molecular networks. we have provided examples of such modeling, overlaying a <dig> gene fitness data onto predicted gbs signaling pathways. we were interested to learn from this analysis that ccpa is predicted to control multiple essential genes, and that the ccpa gene is itself essential . this finding aligns with our experience of unsuccessfully attempting to generate a ccpa knockout in multiple gbs strains . however, other broadly active transcription factors, such as cody, are nonessential. the fatty acid biosynthesis regulator fabt is notable for its control over the completely essential fab operon, also referenced in previous tn-seq studies  <cit> . in our strain, the fitness of the fabt gene itself  is undefined, due to its short length  and its position in a region of low transposon insertion density.

our three mutant libraries showed reproducible insertion distributions . overall, there was widespread and uniform dispersion of mini-transposon insertions throughout the genome. regions of low insertion density  were consistent across our biological replicates, generating the clustered points near the origins of the inter-library correlation plots in fig. 2d. as expected, we noted consistently low insertion density in regions of the chromosome rich in ribosomal protein coding sequences . key housekeeping genes, such as dnaa and dnae were consistently uninterrupted, as expected.

even with pooled sequencing reads, we did not achieve levels of transposon saturation as high as reported in some previous studies; however, saturation levels range widely between different tn-seq studies, and the saturation of our pooled reads  is well above that of mutant libraries used for tn-seq in other species  <cit> . the key measure for making fitness determinations through tn-seq is not the absolute saturation of the library, but whether nonessential genes are consistently and uniformly interrupted by transposon insertions. in our master t <dig> library,  <dig>  % of genes aligned to at least one mapped read, and  <dig>  % of nonessential genes were interrupted at between three and  <dig> unique ta sites. in the case of essential and critical genes, any reads that aligned tended to be very low frequency and clustered at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the gene .

one potential application of this system is toward identification of drug and/or vaccine targets that impair gbs growth. multiple candidate gbs vaccines against capsular polysaccharides and cell-wall associated proteins have been developed, and some are still undergoing testing , but efforts in this area have been hindered by serotype specificity and incomplete immunity. tn-seq fitness data presented in this work might aid in this work by identifying potential antibody targets whose inactivation by binding would impair essential pathways. similarly, small molecule inhibitors of bacterial intracellular signaling and/or metabolic pathways have been proposed as novel antibiotics or adjuvants . the search for novel drug targets may benefit from access to fitness data such as ours.

a major advantage of tn-seq over traditional mutant library screening is the flexibility it offers in experimental design. in vitro work such as we report here can be complemented and enhanced by performing tn-seq on libraries grown under biologically challenging conditions, such as in human fluids or in vivo  <cit> , establishing conditionally essential genes for a given growth environment  <cit> . our system should be easily transferable to other, more physiologically relevant experimental conditions. work toward extending our findings to other gbs strains and growth conditions is underway.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed and tested a reliable system for performing tn-seq in gbs, and have determined the essential genome of strain a <dig>  this tn-seq system is flexible and should permit assessment of conditionally essential genes from biological challenge experiments .
