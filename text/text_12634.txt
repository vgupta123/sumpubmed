BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli  including uropathogenic e. coli , neonatal meningitis e. coli , and avian pathogenic e. coli , cause infection in humans and/or animals  <cit> . one of the most common diseases caused by expec in animals is systemic colibacillosis due to apec that often starts as a respiratory tract infection and progresses to septicemia, which is characterized by fibrinous lesions of the internal organs  <cit> . a variety of factors have been associated with expec virulence including pilus adhesins, the temperature-sensitive hemagglutinin , serum resistance traits , iron acquisition systems , and vacuolating autotransporter toxin   <cit> . chromosomally located virulence genes occur widely among all expec subpathotypes  <cit> , but plasmid-linked virulence genes are more common in apec and nmec subpathotypes than they are in upec  <cit> . it is also well known that expec strains often contain multiple pathogenicity islands , which are horizontally acquired genomic regions of  <dig> to  <dig> kb. pais are present in pathogenic bacteria but absent from e. coli k <dig>  and carry genes encoding one or more virulence factors.

since they are horizontally acquired, they differ from the rest of the genome in g+c content and codon usage  <cit> . the first pai identified on the apec chromosome was the vat-pai, which contains the vacuolating autotransporter gene, vat, a contributor to apec virulence. vat has been reported to be present in about half of the apec, upec, and nmec strains  <cit> . a selc-associated genomic island of apec strain ben <dig> was subsequently described. this island is prevalent in expec strains and is involved in carbohydrate uptake and virulence  <cit> . two pais were characterized in apec o <dig>  one is the pai localized in the large plasmid papec-o1-colbm  <cit> , and the other is pai iapec-o <dig>  harboring irea, the pap operon and the invasion locus tia  <cit> . the pai iapec-o1-related genes occurred not only in strains belonging to the apec subpathotype  but also in upec  and nmec .

in a previous study we used signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis  to identify  <dig> virulence-associated genes in apec  <cit> . one of the genes identified, tkt <dig>  encodes a transketolase-like protein whose amino acid sequence shares 68% identity to tkta of a vibrio cholerae strain  <cit> . however, it does not show any similarity with the tkta gene of e. coli mg <dig> at the nucleotide level. recent completion of the first apec genomic sequence  showed that tkt <dig> is localized on an 'as-yet' uncharacterized genomic island  <cit> . here, we sought to better understand the prevalence and function of tkt <dig> and its associated genomic island in apec pathogenicity.

methods
bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions
all bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  apec o <dig>  an e. coli o1:k1:h <dig> strain that shares strong similarities with sequenced human expec genomes  <cit> , was used to construct the mutants and as a positive control in virulence and other functional assays. a tkta mutant, bj <dig> of an e. coli k <dig> strain, was used as the control strain in the functional analysis of apec o <dig> mutants  <cit> , and e. coli dh5α was employed as a negative control in the virulence assays. a well-characterized collection of apec, fecal e. coli isolated from the feces of healthy birds , human upec, and human nmec were used for gene prevalence studies. strains were grouped phylogenetically using multiplex pcr  <cit> . cells were routinely grown at 37°c in luria bertani broth  supplemented with an appropriate antibiotic: kanamycin , chloramphenicol , or ampicillin , unless otherwise specified.

pcr and multiplex pcr
dna templates were prepared by the rapid boiling-lysis method. primer pairs used were tkt1- f 5'- cttacggcggtactttcctg-3'and tkt 1-r 5'-gtacgccgcatcctgattat-3'; genomic island left junction primer pair pial-f 5'-cgacatcatggattcgattg-3'and pial-r 5'-ggatggtgctggatcgtact-3'; and genomic island right junction primer pair piar-f 5'-gcgccactcttcttctgttc-3' and piar-r 5'-tcagctaattgctcggcttt-3' pcr was accomplished under the following reaction conditions:  <dig> mm magnesium chloride,  <dig>  mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates  <dig>  um each primer, and  <dig> unit taq dna polymerase. reactions were performed in a mastercycler ep machine  using the following cycling parameters: 94°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of 94°c for  <dig> sec, 55°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> min; and a final cycle of 72°c for  <dig> min.

construction of plasmids, mutants and complemented strains
enzymes used for generation of constructs were purchased from new england biolabs. the pbad expression system  was used for cloning and arabinose-inducible expression of tkt <dig> and tkta. the coding sequence of tkt <dig> was amplified by pcr using genomic dna of apec o <dig> as the template. the advantage™  <dig> pcr kit  was used in these experiments according to the manufacturer's directions. the primers used for tkt <dig> gene were the tkt1e-f primer 5'-agctccatggattcacaattactggctaacg-3', which introduces an ncol site  and the tkt1e-r primer 5'- gcattctagagtcatcctttcaccccttgtgcag-3' which introduces an xbai site . the primers used for tkta were tktae-f 5'-agctccatggcctcacgtaaagagcttgcc-3'and tktae-r 5' gcattctagattgcggcccttctcacaaagcat-3' the complete tkt <dig> gene and tkta were cloned into the expression vector pbad <dig> using the created ncoi and xbai sites  <cit>  to obtain pbad tkt <dig> and pbad tkta, respectively . the apec o <dig> mutant strain apec o <dig> mtkt <dig> with plasmid pbad tkt <dig> was designated as apec o1-p <dig>  and the e. coli k <dig> mutant strains bj <dig> harboring the empty pbad <dig>  pbad tkt <dig> and pbad tkta plasmids were designated as bj <dig> p <dig>  bj <dig> p <dig> and bj <dig> p <dig>  respectively.

deletion of tkt <dig> was achieved using the method of datsenko and wanner  <cit> . the cm resistance cassette in pkd <dig>  flanked by 5' and 3' sequences of tkt <dig>  was amplified from genomic dna of strain apec o <dig> using primers tkt1m-f  and tkt1m-r  and was introduced into apec o <dig> by homologous recombination using λ red recombinase. successful Δtkt1::cm mutation was confirmed by pcr, using primers flanking the tkt <dig> region. the Δtkt1::cm derivative of apec o <dig> was designated apec o <dig> mtkt <dig>  the mutant strain apec o <dig> mtkta , a Δtkta::cm derivative of apec o <dig>  was generated using primer pair tktam-f 5'-aagggccgcatttgcggcccttctcacaaagcatcttaccgagtgtaggctggagctgcttcga-3' and tktam-r 5'-cgttaagggcgtgcccttcatcatccgatctggagtcaaacatatgaatatcctccttag-3'. the Δtkt <dig> mutant strain apec o <dig> mtkt <dig>  was complemented by single-copy integration of the plasmid pgptkt <dig>  the tkt <dig> operon, including the 300-bp upstream dna sequence, was amplified by pcr using primers tkt1c-f 5'-tgacagatctgggctatgcagcgatttactac-3' and tkt1c-r 5'-cagttctagatgtgcaggtttagctgttcagt-3'. plasmid pgptkt <dig> was constructed by cloning this bglii-xbai  fragment into the same sites of suicide vector pgp <dig>  <cit> . pgptkt <dig> was conjugated from strain s17- pgptkt <dig> to strain apec o <dig> mtkt <dig>  a strain that was resistant to amp and found to contain a full-length copy of the tkt <dig> gene, as confirmed by pcr, was designated apec o <dig> ctkt <dig> .

phenotype microarray
the phenotype microarray  assay was performed essentially according to published methods using biolog pm plates . apec o <dig> and apec o1Δtkt <dig> were grown overnight at 37°c in bug_b agar . cells were washed with if- <dig> gn base inoculating fluid , and then resuspended in if- <dig> gn base inoculating fluid  at a density corresponding to 85% transmittance . the suspensions were then inoculated into microplate pm1- <dig> for the metabolism test  at a volume of  <dig> μl per well. cell growth was monitored by measuring the respiration-dependent color change of tetrazolium violet in each well. the pm assay was performed twice.

RESULTS
tkt <dig> is strongly associated with apec and expec of the b <dig> phylogenetic group
tkt <dig> was initially identified as an apec-specific gene by genomic subtraction  <cit> . here, we examined its prevalence in a collection of ape and avian fecal e. coli. a pair of primers designated tkt1f and tkt1r  were used to test  <dig> apec and  <dig> avian fecal e. coli strains by pcr. thirty-eight strains from the apec group  were positive for tkt1; while only three strains from avian fecal e. coli group were positive . thus, tkt <dig> is significantly more likely to be present in pathogenic strains . interestingly,  <dig> out of  <dig>  apec strains from phylogenetic group b <dig> were tkt <dig> positive; while the prevalence of tkt <dig> in apec strains from any other phylogenetic group was much lower . since only  <dig> strains of phylogenetic group b <dig> were used, a number inadequate for statistical analysis, an additional  <dig> apec strains of phylogenetic b <dig> group were selected from our collection and examined. a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> apec  from phylogenetic group b <dig> was found to be positive for tkt <dig> , demonstrating that tkt <dig> is significantly  associated with apec strains belonging to phylogenetic group b <dig> 

several recent studies have shown that most human expec strains belong to the b <dig> phylogenetic group  <cit> , and analysis of the genomic sequences of upec strains cft <dig> and  <dig> revealed that they contained tkt <dig>  such results suggest that tkt <dig> might also be prevalent among human expec. to verify this hypothesis,  <dig> upec strains and  <dig> nmec strains were examined by pcr for the presence of tkt <dig>  as expected, 67% of upec and  <dig> % of nmec strains were positive for tkt <dig> gene. as was the case with apec, the majority of upec  and nmec  belonging to phylogenetic group b <dig> were positive for tkt <dig>  therefore, tkt <dig> gene has been significantly associated with expec strains from human and avian hosts, especially with strains of phylogenetic group b <dig> 

tkt <dig> is located on a novel genomic island prevalent in expec of the b <dig> phylogenetic group
study of the genomic sequences of several expec showed that tkt <dig> is located in a 16-kbp genomic island inserted between mete and ysga  <cit> . the overall g+c content of this island is  <dig> %, whereas the average g+c content of the e. coli k- <dig> genome is  <dig> %. this discrepancy in g+c content suggests that this particular stretch of dna does not belong to the e. coli backbone and is foreign. the entire genomic island contains  <dig> orfs, including tkt <dig>  with the function of most of them 'as yet' unknown. products encoded by certain orfs have been assigned hypothetical functions, including a putative permease, putative glucose-specific iibc component of a pts system, carbonate kinase-like protein, and putative transcriptional regulators. besides this genomic island, there is another small genomic islet of about  <dig> kb located between the udp and rmuc genes. this small islet contains  <dig> orfs with unknown functions .

a multiplex pcr panel was developed to determine the presence of the tkt1-containing genomic island in expec of the b <dig> phylogenetic group. three pairs of primers were designed to amplify the left and right junctions, as well as the tkt <dig> gene in  <dig> apec,  <dig> upec and  <dig> nmec belonging to phylogenetic group b <dig>  the results suggest that  <dig> % of apec,  <dig> % of upec and  <dig> % of nmec strains from b <dig> phylogenetic group carry a complete copy of this genomic island . thus, these data demonstrate that this genomic island is significantly associated with expec strains belonging to the b <dig> phylogenetic group.

tkt <dig> could not complement tkta in e. coli k12
recently, genome sequencing of apec o <dig> revealed that tkt <dig> gene encodes a transketolase-like protein whose amino acid sequence shares 68% identity to tkta of a v. cholerae strain  <cit> , although tkt <dig> does not show any similarity to tkta of e. coli mg <dig> at the nucleotide level. to explore the function of tkt <dig>  mutants with single deletions of tkt <dig> and tkta were constructed in the apec o <dig> strain using the method of datsenko and wanner  <cit> , and their growth was compared to each other and the wild type in m <dig> plates with l-arabinose as the sole carbon source. the results showed that both mutants of apec o <dig> were able to grow in m <dig> with the tkta mutant growing slightly slower than the tkt <dig> mutant. however, the control strain e. coli k <dig> bj <dig>  which has a mutation in the tkta, failed to grow in m <dig> plates with l-arabinose   <cit> . these results suggested that, apec o <dig> has another gene that is capable of complementing the tkta mutation. to ascertain if it were tkt <dig>  a tkt <dig> over-expression plasmid pbad tkt <dig> and a tkta over-expression plasmid pbad tkta, in which the tkt <dig> or the tkta gene is under the control of the pbad promoter, were constructed. induction of tkta expression could recover growth of bj502-p <dig> on m <dig> plates with l-arabinose as the sole carbon source, while tkt <dig> expression could not recover growth of bj502-p <dig> . these results suggested that tkt <dig> has very little transketolase activity, if any.

tkt <dig> is involved in peptide nitrogen metabolism
transketolase tkta is involved in carbon metabolism, and tkt <dig> shows a high similarity  to transketolase tkta. to determine if this transketolase-like protein is involved in metabolism, we performed the pm assay under a total of  <dig> culture conditions . growth of wild-type apec o <dig> and its tkt <dig> isogenic mutant was measured using the pm assay system. the time course of cell growth was monitored by measuring the cell density-dependent increase in respiration. no difference between the tkt <dig> mutant and its wild type in the utilization of carbon sources was detected nor were differences in the use of nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur sources or nutrient supplements observed. interestingly, the tkt <dig> mutant showed defects in the use of pro-ala or phe-ala as a peptide nitrogen source. these defective phenotypes were reproducible, and induction of tkt <dig> expression in apec o1-p <dig> resulted in the use of both peptides as nitrogen sources reverting the lost phenotype. complementation assay was also done by using biolog plates and  <dig> % arabinose was added to induce expression of tkt <dig> 

discussion
human and avian expec are both important pathogens that cause widely prevalent and/or highly significant extraintestinal diseases. the gene tkt <dig>  encoding a transketolase-like protein and sharing 68% amino acid identity with tkta of a v. cholerae strain  <cit> , was firstly identified as a virulence-associated gene from apec strains by genomic subtractive hybridization  <cit> . this gene was also thought to be involved in apec virulence from the results of a previous stm study  <cit> . unlike tkta or tktb, which are unequivocally present in both avian fecal e. coli and apec, tkt <dig> was predominantly present among apec  but absent from most of the intestinal e. coli  examined  <cit> , suggesting that this gene may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of avian colibacillosis. apec and human expec have recently been shown to possess remarkable similarities in their disease-causing abilities, serogroups associated with disease, and virulence genotypes and traits, such as the presence of adhesins, iron acquisition systems, toxins, protectins and invasins that enable them to grow and cause disease in the extraintestinal host environments  <cit> . the inference of a close genetic relationship between apec and human expec strains was further substantiated by the distribution of tkt <dig>  about 67% of upec and  <dig> % of nmec strains examined in this study harbor tkt <dig>  like many other virulence genes of expec, tkt <dig> is also phylogenetically distributed. of the expec belonging to b <dig> phylogenetic group,  <dig> % apec,  <dig> % of upec and  <dig> % of nmec were positive for tkt <dig>  e. coli from phylogenetic group b <dig> have already been experimentally and epidemiologically associated with extraintestinal infections  <cit> . these results also suggest that tkt <dig> may play a role in the pathogenesis of human expec as well as apec.

genomic sequencing of apec o <dig> revealed more than  <dig> genomic islands; several of them are theoretically involved in virulence  <cit> . common features of most, if not all pais, include that they encode one or more virulence factors; range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb; and are likely introduced into the genome via horizontal transfer, resulting in g-c ratios and codon usage that may deviate from the organism's typical pattern. often pais are flanked by small direct repeats and are associated with the 3' end of trna genes. pais may be phage-derived, but some are thought to originate from plasmids. they may contain mobility elements, such as integrons, transposons, and insertion sequences, and if they move, are likely carried on plasmids, conjugative transposons, or phages, whose loss may spontaneously convert a virulent into an avirulent organism  <cit> . similarly, the genomic island encoding tkt <dig> is  <dig> kb in size and present in the apec o <dig> genome but absent from the sequenced genome of the e. coli k <dig> strain mg <dig>  moreover, the overall g+c content of this island is  <dig> %, whereas the average g+c content of the e. coli k- <dig> genome is  <dig> %. this discrepancy in g+c content further suggests that this particular stretch of dna does not belong to the e. coli k <dig> backbone and is foreign-derived. also, the genomic island encoding tkt <dig> is localized in close proximity to trna genes. unlike classical pais, no flanking direct repeats or mobility elements such as integrases or transposases were found in this genomic island.

however, such mobility elements may have been lost during the evolutionary process. horizontal transfer of genes by genomic islands or pais is a common phenomenon in extracellular bacterial pathogens. the acquisition of genes in this way allows bacteria to adapt to a new or changing environment thus contributing to the fitness and/or virulence of the recipient organism.

pais have been described in several well-known expec strains, including e. coli strains  <dig>  cft <dig>  j <dig>  uti <dig>  rs <dig> and apec o <dig>  indeed, comparative analysis of the apec o <dig> genome and other expec genomes revealed that apec and human expec share more than  <dig> pathogenicity  islands  <cit> . among them, the genomic island encoding tkt <dig> was notable in that it was found among all sequenced expec genomes. the multiplex pcr results of this study further demonstrated that a complete copy of this genomic island is significantly associated with both avian and human expec strains of phylogenetic group b <dig>  these observations suggest that the tkt <dig> genomic island may contribute to the virulence/fitness of both avian and human expec.

though tkt <dig> shares 68% amino acid identity with tkta of a v. cholerae strain  <cit> , it does not show any homology at the nucleotide level with tkta of e. coli mg <dig>  in e. coli k <dig>  tkta encodes the transketolase a, which is responsible for the major enzymatic activity of transketolase in e. coli. transketolase is a link between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway and is involved in the catabolism of pentose sugars, formation of d-ribose 5-phosphate, and provision of d-erythrose 4-phosphate which is a precursor of aromatic amino acids, aromatic vitamins and pyridoxine  <cit> . a previous study showed that the e. coli k <dig> mutant bj <dig> that carries a mutation in tkta was unable to use l-arabinose or d-xylose as the sole carbon source and required aromatic acids for growth on a minimal medium. the functional analysis in this study demonstrated that over-expression of tkt <dig> in e. coli k <dig> mutant strain bj <dig> could not recover its growth in m <dig> medium with l-arabinose as the sole carbon source; while over-expression of tkta could. these results suggest that tkt <dig> could not complement the tkta mutation in e. coli k <dig> and tkt <dig> confers very little transketolase activity, if any.

most studies of bacterial pathogenesis have focused on classical virulence factors such as toxins, adhesins, iron uptake systems and factors that confer resistance to innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. however, the role of metabolism in virulence and fitness of bacterial pathogens is becoming better appreciated. recently, a selc-associated genomic island of apec strain ben <dig> was found to be involved in carbohydrate uptake and virulence  <cit> . also in the same apec strain, a carbohydrate metabolic operon  that is highly associated with expec promotes fitness under stressful conditions and invasion of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . our stm results showed that one tkt <dig> stm-mutant was out-competed by the wild type from two to a thousand fold in lung, heart, liver, kidney and spleen of 5-week-old chickens. the functional analysis using phenotype microarray revealed that a tkt <dig> mutant has defects in use of pro-ala or phe-ala as a nitrogen source. these results strongly suggest that tkt <dig> is involved in bipeptide metabolism and contributes to fitness and virulence of apec. interestingly, dipeptide transport proteins, dppa and oppa, were identified to be up-regulated when upec strain cft <dig> was cultured in human urine compared to cft <dig> cultured in lb depleted with iron  <cit> . the greatest challenges confronted by bacterial pathogens are environmental changes, including the rapid changes they encounter in nutrient availability  <cit> . in the course of evolution, pathogenic organisms have developed several mechanisms to sense and utilize available nutrient sources associated with particular niches or to favor the most efficiently metabolizable nutrient sources when exposed to a range of choices  <cit> . thus, genes involved in metabolism, which are required for bacterial growth in specific infection sites, contribute to fitness and virulence. on the other hand, the efficiency of metabolism of a nutrient source or the presence of a specific nutrient source might serve as a signal to switch 'on' or 'off' specific virulence genes in particular infection niches  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a previously identified virulence-associated gene tkt <dig> was further characterized in this study. the results demonstrated that this gene is strongly associated with expec strains of phylogenetic group b <dig> from human and avian origin and is localized in a genomic island. function analyses showed that tkt <dig> has very little transketolase activity and seems to be involved in peptide nitrogen metabolism.
