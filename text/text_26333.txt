BACKGROUND
current rapid technological advances in whole genome dna sequencing, based on novel or previously existing principles, are gradually replacing established sanger method variants. many of these advanced next generation sequencing  technologies are in widespread use. examples include  <dig> pyrosequencing, based on the use of single primer-coated beads, combined with dna amplification in which luciferase-generated light is emitted upon addition of individual nucleotides to the nascent dna
 <cit> , and rolling circle replication, in which genomic dna sections are formed into dna nanoparticles 
 <cit> . another ngs technology, sequencing-by-synthesis , involves multiple rounds of reversible fluorescent dye-terminator addition to immobilized template by engineered polymerase, imaging, and dye and 3′ blocker removal
 <cit> . sequencing by ligation / solid technology  uses mismatch-sensitive dna ligase to join oligonucleotides on complementary template section
 <cit> , while ion semiconductor sequencing  employs detection of hydrogen ions produced by dna polymerization
 <cit> . single molecule real-time sequencing  is based on fluorescent dye removal upon nucleotide addition
 <cit> . a final example, polony sequencing combines in vitro paired-tag library amplification with emulsion pcr, ligation chemistry and automated microscopy
 <cit> .

an initial step common to all of these techniques is fragmentation of high molecular weight  dna starting material
 <cit> . ngs methods use various hmw materials, including genomic libraries, long-range pcr products, cdna, and genomic and metagenomic dna
 <cit> . from this starting material, sequencing libraries and/or pcr matrices are prepared, for use in either ngs or conventional sanger sequencing. one challenging aspect of high-throughput ngss is associated with computerized assembly of sequence data when the “bottom-up”, shotgun approach is used for more complex genomes; with sequence repeats that frequently cause gaps in contig assembly are a particular problem. sequence data fill-in methods, such as long-range pcr and genomic libraries, are thus very useful at this final stage
 <cit> . libraries are used for physical genome map construction, gene cloning and as a source of direct sequencing templates, which include short genomic fragments up to several thousand bp and p <dig> phage artificial chromosomes , bacterial artificial chromosomes  and yeast artificial chromosomes  containing large inserts . such bac and yac clones were recently used to assemble de novo an entire synthetic prokaryotic genome and to convert one bacteria species into another
 <cit> . physical and enzymatic methods, such as low-pressure hydrodynamic shearing
 <cit> , sonication
 <cit> , atomization
 <cit> , nebulization
 <cit> , point-sink shearing
 <cit> , limited dnase i digestion
 <cit>  and limited restriction endonuclease  cleavage
 <cit> , are required to ensure the most unbiased and random possible dna fragmentation. the first five of these methods are prone to dna damage, are irreproducible, need frequent calibration and specialized equipment, and are often difficult to automate. enzymatic methods, including rease digestion, would thus seem to be the methods of choice
 <cit> ; however, of more than  <dig> known naturally-occurring reases that cleave 4-8-bp sequences, all except three cviji/cviji*
 <cit> , seti
 <cit>  and faii
 <cit>  do so too infrequently  to easily generate complete coverage with randomly overlapping fragments, even under partial digestion conditions. an alternative approach, quasi-random fragmentation, involves the application of the enzyme mixture nebnext dsdna fragmentase. in this method dsdna breaks are produced by the concerted action of two enzymes, with one enzyme randomly nicking dsdna, and the other recognizing the nicked site and cutting the dna strand opposite the nick
 <cit> . another drawback of rease-based approaches is that the distribution of rease recognition sites is variable within different genes, dnas of different gc content, dna regions and genomes
 <cit> , requiring the construction of multiple libraries with different enzymes. creation of a set of effective enzymatic molecular tools would consequently help overcome these problems, thereby speeding up the implementation of genomic research projects.

we have previously reported that tspgwi, a member of our newly-designated thermus sp. family of bifunctional reases-mtases
 <cit> , exhibits a novel type of substrate specificity change causing much more frequent cleavage. this feature could be useful for improving genomic technologies
 <cit> . the observed specificity change
 <cit>  is induced by the replacement of the enzyme cofactor sam with its analogue, sin, which causes a change in rease cleavage frequency that is statistically equivalent to a 5-bp to 3-bp recognition site shift. the new taqii/sin/dmso “molecular scissors” presented in this paper are potentially very useful for generating quasi-random genomic libraries, as there are only five other high-specificity enzyme that possess similarly frequent dna cleavage properties: cviji/cviji*, faii, seti, tspgwi/sin and nebnext dsdna fragmentase. in addition to its use for library construction and sequencing, new ultra-frequent dna fragmentation technology based on the unique “affinity star activity”  of some of the thermus sp. family enzymes may be useful for other cloning applications.

in this paper, we describe a second case  of this unusual type of rease specificity relaxation, in which a 6-bp recognition site was replaced by the statistical equivalent of a  <dig> -bp recognition site. in addition to its basic research aspect, this discovery has important practical applications for the fields of genomics, metagenomics and biotechnology. to demonstrate its usefulness, we applied this technology to the construction of equus caballus  genomic and cdna libraries. we also used this tool to generate butyrylcholinesterase coding segment deletion derivatives, which in a subsequent study  was used to aid cloning and expression of a biologically active enzyme.

RESULTS
optimization of the synergistic effect of sin, reaction ph, salt and dmso concentrations on the maximum “affinity star”  of taqii specificity
our previously published preliminary results suggested that taqii rease exhibits pronounced star activity, which can be further stimulated by sin. in those earlier studies, however, taqii affinity star specificity was not determined, nor were reaction conditions of this phenomenon evaluated in great detail
 <cit> . to investigate basic research aspects of this specificity and to adapt taqii rease and its affinity star variant for practical use in recombinant dna technology, we studied reaction parameters to determine those required to achieve:  the lowest minimum affinity star activity maintaining reasonable cleavage activity with 5′-gaccga-3′ cognate specificity
 <cit>  and  maximum stimulation of taqii specificity transition towards ultra-frequent cleavage.

in previous study
 <cit> , we had observed that both tspgwi and taqii were affected by sam and sin; however, the sin stimulatory/relaxation effect of taqii, although evident, manifested itself much more slowly and to a lesser extent. to enhance the rate of the specific sin effect on taqii, in this study we therefore explored other reaction conditions, such as ph, salt concentration and the presence of dmso. because preliminary experiments showed that dmso was highly stimulatory compared with other organic solvents , we investigated it further. in addition, our experiments revealed a somewhat unexpected phenomenon: ph, salt and dmso concentrations effects were not simply additive with respect to the sin stimulatory/relaxation effect, but were instead more intricately intertwined. more elaborate experiments were therefore needed to pinpoint minimum and maximum affinity star digestion conditions.

as a starting point, we used our previously published taqii star inhibitory/ stimulatory buffer compositions
 <cit> :  40 mm tris–hcl , 10 mm 2so <dig>  10 mm mgcl <dig>  1 mm dtt and bsa  and  40 mm tris–hcl , 10 mm mgcl <dig>  1 mm dttand bsa . both reaction buffer variants were supplemented with a 100 μm saturating concentration of sin  and optimized for dmso. to precisely determine tested reaction factors, confirm they induced the same specificity and simplify interpretation of electrophoresis results, a custom 390-bp pcr fragment with a single  5′-gaccga-3′ site was used as a dna substrate for cleavage reaction analysis. this substrate, with the taqii recognition sequence, was obtained using pcr with a forward mutagenic primer, . we tested the effect of different dmso concentrations, ranging from  <dig> to 50%, under the two radically different reaction buffer conditions described above. cleavage reactions were performed for 16 h under enzyme saturating conditions , designed to ensure taqii enzyme was not a limiting factor in the initial experiment . our results were interesting and unexpected: maximum star activity was observed with 20-30% dmso at ph  <dig> , which in the absence of dmso inhibited taqii star activity . we previously found that ph  <dig>  was highly stimulatory for natural and sin-induced taqii specificity  changes
 <cit> ; however, at ph  <dig> , the addition of dmso radically changed the taqii response to sin. although the banding pattern observed at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the presence of sin and dmso pointed to the same affinity star recognition site specificity, a ph of  <dig>  stimulated the enzyme and relaxed its specificity much more so than did ph  <dig>  . to determine the set of conditions leading to a fully relaxed taqii recognition sequence and to practically apply this phenomenon to quasi-random genomic library construction, in addition to other reasons further experiments were performed at ph  <dig> . although we did not investigate the chemical nature of the ph- and dmso-dependent sin effect, we suggest that the results may be due to alternations in the protonation state of the pentose-attached sin, side chain which contains two amino groups and a carboxyl group in close proximity to one another. these charge fluctuations may affect the interaction of sin bound to the taqii allosteric protein motif and cause subtle differences in active protein conformation, which are enhanced by the presence of dmso.

bearing in mind the significant influence of ionic strength on cognate taqii and taqii star activity , we performed a series of taqii cleavage reactions with variable concentrations of ammonium sulfate in the ph-optimized reaction buffer to ascertain maximum affinity star stimulatory conditions. we chose ammonium sulfate as the salt component because preliminary experiments indicated it had a generally slightly higher cognate cleavage stimulatory effect than the commonly used nacl at equivalent ionic strength. ammonium sulfate also appears to stabilize taqii to a greater extent .

the maximum affinity star activity in the tested 0–40 mm ammonium sulfate concentration range was obtained at 10 mm, which was much higher than that observed between  <dig> and 5 mm . again, this is atypical, as most reases become more prone to star activity, when the ionic strength is decreased
 <cit> . the presence of small amounts of salts such as ammonium sulfate contributing both ammonium and highly charged sulfate ions, may stabilize interaction between taqii and sin; these latter molecules apparently form a complex with different properties than those of the natural taqii-sam complex.

in summary, maximum taqii affinity star activity, as established under carefully controlled substrate and reaction conditions, took place in 40 mm tris–hcl , 10 mm 2so <dig>  10 mm mgcl <dig>  1 mm dtt, bsa , 100 μm sin and 30% dmso. because 30% dmso significantly hindered agarose gel electrophoresis and gel isolation of the resulting longer restriction fragments, it was less practically suitable than 20% dmso. reaction mixtures obtained using 30% dmso required proteinase k treatment, phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to electrophoresis. these procedures were necessary to prevent diffuse gel bands and eliminate macromolecular complexes, formed when larger dnas are digested following cleavage by taqii/sin/dmso, and which barely move on the electrophoretic gel. because it was more suitable for the cleavage of high molecular mass dna substrate the 20% dmso concentration was consequently chosen for further experiments.

independence of sin/dmso-induced affinity star taqii dna cleavage from cognate taqii recognition sequence presence
although tspgwi and taqii are closely related with respect to amino acid sequence properties and belong to the same thermus sp. enzyme subfamily, they exhibit marked differences in cognate site arrangement preferences
 <cit> . in contrast to tspgwi, which prefers the presence of two cognate sites in a dna substrate
 <cit> , taqii rease can cleave a single canonical 5′-gaccga-3′ site regardless of whether sam or sin is present in the reaction buffer 
 <cit> . the taqii cleavage pattern observed is strongly dependent on the reaction buffer used. when we used the taqii star inhibitory condition 2so <dig>  no sin) determined from our earlier study
 <cit> , taqii rease cleavage of a single site substrate   was efficient and yielded the expected 48-bp dna fragment . the addition of sin to the reaction buffer only marginally stimulates taqii star activity at ph  <dig>  and then only when the canonical taqii site was present in the dna substrate .

the analogous dna fragment lacking a cognate taqii recognition sequence  was not cleaved at ph  <dig> , either in the presence or absence of sin . under star stimulatory conditions , however, taqii rease relaxation was clearly noticeable in the specificity of dna recognition, even in the absence of sin . the addition of the cofactor analogue strongly stimulated taqii affinity star activity, as demonstrated by the appearance of multiple additional bands .

at ph  <dig>  the influence of dmso on taqii rease was similar for cognate site  and  dna substrates. this organic solvent strongly stimulated taqii star activity, regardless of whether the taqii canonical site was present or absent . the strongest effect was observed with 20-30% dmso in combination with sin. at ph  <dig> , however, the addition of dmso exerted opposite inhibitory effect, decreasing both cognate taqii and sin-induced taqii affinity star activities . the above results, demonstrated using model dna fragments, were confirmed through practical biotechnological applications: horse genomic dna and butyrylcholinesterase cdna library construction. the pcr product of a 1841 bp long cdna fragment, corresponding to the butyrylcholinesterase intronless gene and its short  flanking sequences was fragmented in the predicted fashion, analogous to the pcr model described above.

determination of taqii affinity star recognition sequences and cleavage site
to determine the recognition site specificity and cleavage positions of taqii affinity star activity induced by sin/dmso, we performed shotgun cloning of the digestion products of bacteriophage lambda  dna . taqii cleavage reactions were carried out using a recombinant enzyme in the presence of affinity star stimulating factors: either a combination of 100 μm sin/20% dmso , or 100 μm sin alone. the generated restriction fragment ends were repaired with t <dig> dna polymerase/dntps, and cloned into the smai site of a puc <dig> vector
 <cit> . to identify vector-insert junctions, we sequenced  <dig> randomly chosen clones.

analysis of the resulting sequence data revealed that in the presence of sin/dmso with taqii in molar excess over recognition sites , the rease recognized and cleaved at least  <dig> variants containing altered bases of the canonical 5′-gaccga-3′ sequence . changes in the restriction site involved one or two bp in the canonical 6-bp dna sequence . interestingly, no fixed “core”-invariable recognition sequence was identified, and variants with up to two base departures from the canonical sequence, regardless of the location, were recognized . no variants exhibited changes in both first and second positions, nor in both second and fifth positions. the fact that adenine, which is methylated by taqii methyltransferase activity could be replaced by any of the other bases is particularly fascinating. this implies that the enzyme was no longer flipping the base into the methyltransferase binding pocket
 <cit> , a process that contributes a significant amount of the binding energy for normal type iig recognition. in the presence of sin without dmso, however, preferred kinetic specificity changes favored single-bp departure canonical site variants, although 2-bp departures from the canonical taqii site were also present . it can thus be concluded that dmso acts as an enhancer of the sin-specific relaxation effect.

under standard  conditions, taqii canonical 5′-gaccga-3′ sequences would be expected to be cleaved on average every 4096 bp
 <cit> . sin/dmso-induced taqii affinity star activity resulted in extremely frequent cleavage approaching that of the most frequent cutters, i.e., cviji/cviji* , seti  and faii 
 <cit> . counting, tspgwi/sin 3-bp specificity, taqii/sin/dmso would thus be only the fifth frequent cutter available out of all known rease prototype specificities. based on  <dig> variants of the 6-bp canonical site being detected , complete dna digestion by the affinity star taqii should theoretically lead to cleavage approximately every  <dig>  bp , equivalent to a  <dig>  bp long recognition site. as in the case with tspgwi/sin/dmso and the 2/3-bp cutter cviji/cviji*
 <cit> , however, complete digestion does not take place. one explanation for this behavior, common to all these enzymes, might be steric limitations imposed by cleavage of the very short dna substrates dominating the reaction during the course of digestion
 <cit> . even under partial digestion conditions, however, very frequent cutters are still useful for genomic library preparation, yielding a quasi-random accumulation of dna sequences  they are also of value in other cloning technologies, including ultrasensitive dna; labeling/amplification
 <cit> , highest resolution restriction mapping
 <cit> , rflp, single-copy gene amplification, detection/identification of non-cultured pathogenic microorganisms
 <cit>  and for increasing the limited pool of commercially available type ii reases specificities.

taqii/sin/dmso cleavage of complex bacterial genomes
to determine desirable reaction conditions and test the utility of taqii/sin/dmso for hmw dna digestion, two bacterial genomes with different gc contents were selected: escherichia coli  and thermus thermophilus hb <dig> 
 <cit> . cleavage reactions were performed using the optimized reaction buffer discussed above ph  <dig>  with 2so <dig>  sin and 20% dmso . when digested under enzyme saturating conditions taqii/sin/dmso activity was able to easily fragment hmw dna into fragments less than approximately 500-bp long, rather than clear superimposed bands due to highly biased site preference, a “smear” was observed on the electrophoretic gel. taqii/sin/dmso may therefore be a useful tool for quasi-random fragmentation of complex genomic dna for genomic library preparation. the average restriction fragment size obtained in an analogous experiment comparing digestion of e. coli and t. thermophilus genomes was slightly different, with larger sizes observed in the case of t. thermophilus . this may have been due to the less intense distribution of taqii affinity star sites in the high gc-content dna or impaired binding of taqii to such substrate dna under affinity star conditions.

taqii/sin/dmso cleavage and library construction of eukaryotic  genomic dna and butyrylcholinesterase cdna
finally, we practically characterized taqii affinity star activity and applied it to the construction of representative horse genomic dna libraries to be used in cloning and construction of intact and truncated butyrylcholinesterase gene variants and domains . this was accomplished by preparation of a bac library from horse liver genomic dna, which was created with taqii/sin/dmso-derived inserts in the f factor-based bac vector pbelobac <dig>  interestingly, bands superimposed over the dna smear were observed during horse liver genomic dna digestion . because the horse genome is approximately  <dig> times larger than the two model bacterial genomes we digested under the same conditions , it is technically unlikely that these bands corresponded to enzyme recognition site bias on the eukaryotic dna; this would be below the detection limit of the ethidium-bromide stained agarose gels. the superimposed bands instead represent repetitive dna sequences or structural genomic dna variations detected using taqii/sin/dmso digestion . although evaluation of this interesting aspect is beyond the scope of this paper, it may prove useful for analysis and detection of such sequences repeats and structural variations.

variations in reaction duration and enzyme quantity had no effect on the partial digestion pattern detected. for convenience short reaction times with high enzyme concentrations would therefore be preferable for library preparation . the resulting bac library contained over  <dig>  clones; insert sizes in  <dig> randomly chosen clones ranged from  <dig> to 150 kb, with inserts missing from fewer than 5% . vector-insert junction sequencing of  <dig> clones  confirmed the taqii/sin/dmso affinity star recognition sites that were systematically evaluated using bacteriophage λ dna .

the cdna from total horse liver mrna was subjected to pcr using butyrylcholinesterase-specific primers. the resulting 1841-bp dna fragment was comparatively digested with three frequently cleaving reases: our novel taqii/sin/dmso tool and two enzymes commonly used for library preparation, haeiii and cviji . the digestion fragment pools generated with taqii/sin/dmso were similar in size to those obtained with cviji  but smaller than those obtained with haeiii  . because substrate dna was relatively short, discrete bands were also observed especially with haeiii, which had the longest recognition site. cviji recognizes 5′-rgcy-3′ sites, which are equivalent to the statistical 3-bp recognition site. consequently, the calculated  <dig>  bp combined recognition site for taqii/sin/dmso is in very good agreement with experimental data, as confirmed by two independent methods: bacteriophage λ shotgun library insert-vector junctions analysis and direct dna digestion analysed on electrophoretic gels. it is important to note that neither sin nor dmso alone trigger the taqii recognition site transition from 6 bp to  <dig>  bp. apparently, by sufficiently relaxing the tertiary taqii protein structure, dmso greatly enhances functional substitution of sam, bound to the allosteric effector protein pocket, by sin. interestingly, one of the taqii/sin/dmso recognition sites listed in figure 
 <dig> is the canonical recognition variant 5′-caccca-3′
 <cit> , which is not cleaved by recombinant taqii in the absence of sin and dmso
 <cit> .

small differences observed on the gel between the cviji and taqii/sin/dmso fragment size distributions may be due to different frequencies of their recognition sites on the butyrylcholinesterase-specific pcr fragment as well as the tendency of taqii rease to cleave dna incompletely, as shown previously
 <cit> . the tendency toward partial digestion exhibited by taqii/sin/dmso is of practical use in genomic and biotechnology research, however, as it simplifies and allows for greater control of partial dna digestion during construction of libraries or gene deletion derivatives. the products of such controlled partial digestions of butyrylcholinesterase-specific pcr fragments were cloned and aided the construction of biologically active horse butyrylcholinesterase enzyme , which was subsequently used in other biotechnological applications .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study taqii bifunctional rease was shown to change specificity in the presence of a cofactor analogue, sin . it was transformed from a 6-bp recognition site enzyme to one of combined  <dig> -bp specificity, thus radically increasing cleavage frequency from 4096 bp to  <dig>  bp. we found that the addition of dmso to the sin-stimulated taqii reaction had a synergistic enhancing effect, with neither dmso nor sin alone effecting complete and maximum specificity transition. taqii/sin/dmso recognition sequence specificity included  <dig> truncated variants that were 1–2 bp different from the canonical 6-bp recognition site; taqii/sin/dmso dna cleavage thus does not require the presence of a canonical taqii recognition site. taqii affinity star specificity was used to develop a new genomic tool for representative library generation, with its usefulness demonstrated by construction of horse genomic and butyrylcholinesterase gene deletion derivative libraries.

this ultra-frequent dna cutter also has potential application to other dna manipulation methods, including ultrasensitive dna labelling/amplification, high resolution restriction mapping, rflp, single-copy genes amplifications, metagenomics, and detection/identification of pathogenic microorganisms without culturing.
