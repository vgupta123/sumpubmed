BACKGROUND
down syndrome  is the most frequent genomic aneuploidy with an incidence of approximately  <dig> in  <dig> live-newborn  <cit>  resulting from the presence of an extra copy of human chromosome  <dig> . ds is characterized by a complex phenotype with features that are not fully penetrant. the most frequent manifestations, which are virtually always present, include mental retardation, morphological abnormalities of the head and limbs, short stature, hypotonia and hyperlaxity of ligaments. other features occur with less frequency such as organ malformations, particularly of the heart , several types of gastrointestinal tract obstructions or dysfunctions , increased risk of leukaemia , and early occurrence of an alzheimer-like neuropathology  <cit> . ds has been investigated with multiple functional genomics studies aiming to understand the molecular basis underlying the various aspects of the disease  <cit> .

the most commonly accepted pathogenetic hypothesis is that the dosage imbalance of genes on hsa <dig> is responsible for the molecular dysfunctions in ds, meaning that genes on the triplicated chromosome are overexpressed due to an extra chromosome  <dig>  as demonstrated for selected genes like sod <dig> and dyrk1a  <cit> . recent global transcriptome studies with microarrays, however, have generated a more complex picture in the sense that not all hsa <dig> genes have an elevated expression level as expected  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is that the phenotype is due to an unstable environment resulting from the dosage imbalance of the hundreds of genes on hsa <dig> which determines a non-specific disturbance of genomic regulation and expression. the significantly higher inter-individual variability in ds, as compared to euploid, individuals supports this hypothesis  <cit> . moreover, the two hypotheses could be coexistent  <cit> . in both hypotheses it is understood that besides alterations of gene expression of hsa <dig> genes there are numerous genome-wide effects that lead to the dysregulation of many non-hsa <dig> genes through molecular pathways and interactions.

many studies on the transcriptome and proteome levels have been conducted to understand the causal relationship between genes at dosage imbalance and ds phenotypes  <cit> . gene expression profiles have been analysed from ds fetal  <cit>  and adult human tissues  <cit> . additionally, two classes of mouse models  <cit>  have been developed for investigating the molecular genetics of ds, either mouse models with partial trisomies of the syntenic regions of hsa <dig> in mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  such as ts <dig>  <cit> , ts65dn  <cit>  and ts1cje mice  <cit> , or transgenic mice for specific genes such as sod <dig>  <cit> . studies of gene expression profiles in human ds samples and mouse models have shown high genome-wide variability  <cit> . furthermore, differences due to the applied experimental platforms, specific tissues, developmental stages or the triplicated segments under study introduce a high variation to the assessment of genome-wide effects of ds. here, integrative and comparative studies are pivotal for the analysis of the complex nature of gene expression and regulation in ds at a more general level  <cit> .

meta-analysis was proven to be a valid strategy to extract consistent information from heterogeneous data, in particular with respect to complex phenotypes for example cancer  <cit> , alzheimer  <cit>  and type- <dig> diabetes mellitus  <cit> . the purpose of meta-analysis is to compensate experiment-specific variations and to reveal consistent information across a wide range of experiments. to date, such a meta-analysis of ds data is missing.

in this paper we describe a comprehensive meta-analysis from  <dig> different ds studies on human and mouse on the transcriptome and proteome level including quantitative data such as affymetrix microarrays, rt-pcr and maldi studies as well as qualitative data such as sage and western blot analyses. we applied an established computational framework  <cit>  and identified  <dig> genes with consistent dosage effects in many of these studies. as expected, we observed a high fraction of hsa <dig> genes  but also a large amount of non-hsa <dig> genes . besides well investigated genes in the context of ds we detected a significant proportion of novel ones . the  <dig> genes were further investigated using functional information, molecular interactions and promoter analysis revealing over-represented motifs of four transcription factors: runx <dig>  e2f <dig>  staf/pax <dig> and stat <dig>  in order to test the relevance of the  <dig> genes for more general brain phenotypes we used independent publicly available data on cerebral pathologies not related to ds and identified a subset of  <dig> ds genes that were differentially expressed in these studies. the detected dosage effects can be used as a resource for further studies of ds pathology, functional experiments and the development of therapies. all data have been agglomerated and made available through a web server that tracks results of the meta-analysis http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de/ and that enables the community to validate any gene of interest in the light of the experimental data.

RESULTS
genome-wide dosage effects
genome-wide dosage effects were computed with the numerical scoring method described in material and methods. in total,  <dig> case-control experiments were interrogated , the alteration for each gene between the trisomic and normal states was scored in each experiment, gene scores were summarised across all experiments and the significance of the summarised scores was judged with a bootstrap approach. this procedure resulted in a cut-off score value of  <dig>  and identified  <dig> genes as being predominantly affected by ds. the thirty genes with the highest dosage effects, either on hsa <dig> or on other chromosomes, are listed in table  <dig>  the entire gene list is given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

the meta-analysis identified genes that showed consistent changes in many of the different experiments rather than genes that were affected by a single  experiment . this is an important fact since, for example, different mouse models have different coverage of triplicated hsa <dig> genes, and, thus, might introduce model-specific bias  <cit> . the consistency of the dosage effect was measured for each gene with an entropy criterion  and figure 1a reveals a strong preference for the selection of high-entropy genes. highest scores were assigned to hsa <dig> genes  what indicates that the meta-analysis scores reflect the effect of an extra chromosome  <dig> on gene expression . while proportionally most dosage effects were identified for hsa <dig> genes , the majority of genes  was located on other chromosomes highlighting the genome-wide impact of ds .

genome-wide dosage effects underlined the severe phenotypic consequences of ds caused by genes with a major role in human development . of the  <dig> non-hsa <dig> genes,  <dig> were associated with development, in particular with respect to organ development , tissue development  and cell development . amongst these genes were known interactors of hsa <dig> genes, for example rest . rest modulates expression of genes encoding fundamental neuronal functions including ion channels, synaptic proteins and neurotransmitter receptors and has been linked to an inherited form of mental retardation. recently, canzonetta et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the region capable of affecting rest levels, in both mouse and human cells, could be assigned to the dyrk1a locus on hsa <dig> which was found among the top-scoring hsa <dig> genes .

txnip  had the highest dosage effect  of all non-hsa <dig> genes. it has weak association with ds yet  but could play a major role for several ds phenotypes. it is a key signalling molecule involved in glucose homeostasis  <cit> , cardiovascular homeostasis  <cit>  and leukaemia  <cit> .

enrichment of genomic location with respect to the  <dig> genes was observed in regions of hsa <dig> and the respective syntenic regions on mouse chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . moreover, in the human genome, additional enrichment on chr3q <dig> was computed containing the genes gyg <dig> , plod <dig> , plscr <dig> and chst <dig> .

dosage effects on hsa21
proportionally hsa <dig> contributed mostly to the detected dosage effects . on the other hand, it is remarkable that only a third of all hsa <dig> genes  showed consistent effects across the different experiments . while  <dig> genes had a positive score below the significance threshold of  <dig>  indicating relevance with respect to specific experiments only,  <dig> genes had a score near zero indicating that dosage effects were either compensated or not detected with the selected experimental data .

hsa <dig> dosage effects included, for example app  involved in senile plaque formation in ds and alzheimer's disease  <cit> , sod <dig> , a key enzyme in the metabolism of oxygen-derived free radicals  <cit> , dyrk1a -phosphorylation regulated kinase 1a) involved in neuroblast proliferation, crucial for brain function, learning and memory  <cit> , runx <dig>  which plays a critical role in normal hematopoiesis  <cit> , or gabpa  encoding a dna binding domain with a huge variety of targets including genes from different cell/tissue specificities and functions  <cit> . hsa <dig> genes were mostly up-regulated in gene expression studies  with the exception of eight genes that were either variable or down-regulated . possible explanations for this observation might be tissue-specificity of gene expression as in the case of mrps <dig> which was mostly up-regulated in brain samples and down-regulated in other tissues like heart or kidney, or differences in human and mouse gene expression as in the case of cbs which was up-regulated in human but down-regulated in mouse experiments what might be caused by differential tissue specificity of the orthologous mouse gene  <cit> .

three genomic regions on hsa <dig> were enriched with the significant genes using the msigdb_c <dig> positional database: chr21q <dig>  chr21q <dig> and chr21q <dig>  located on the q-terminal arm . this contradicts the hypothesis that a single region on hsa <dig> could be responsible for the molecular and phenotypic consequences of ds with only a few responsive genes  <cit> . rather our findings support studies that identified more than one hsa <dig> region causative for ds phenotypes so that the dosage effects were not uniformly distributed along the chromosome but rather enriched in certain regions on hsa <dig> similar to the results in  <cit> .

functional annotation using gene enrichment analysis
functional annotation of biological pathways was retrieved from the consensuspathdb  <cit> , a meta-database that summarizes the content of  <dig> human interaction databases. a total of  <dig>  pre-defined pathways were screened with the  <dig> genes using gene set enrichment analysis  <cit> . a total of  <dig> pathways were found significantly enriched < <dig> ) of which several pathways were associated with neurological and neuropathological processes . these pathways referred mainly to  neurodegeneration  and  defects in synapsis . furthermore, the results emphasized the role of tyrosine-kinase receptors in ds pathology - mediating signalling or ngf signalling via trka) which interact directly with bdnf . moreover, our results showed gene dosage effects caused either directly by genes located on hsa <dig>  or indirectly by hsa <dig> interactors, highlighting the intrinsic complexity of the ds pathology. for example, pik3r <dig> de-regulation impacts on many of these pathways and is a direct interactor of ifnar <dig>  a significant ds gene. a similar effect can be observed for tpj1a that has interactions with hsa <dig> genes jam <dig> and cdln <dig> both showing consistent dosage effects .

dosage effects on transcriptional regulation
dysregulation of transcriptional regulation is widely reported in ds  <cit> . among the  <dig> significant genes were  <dig> transcription factors  ,  <dig> tfs  had significant enrichment of their targets as retrieved by the transfac  <cit>  database. additionally,  <dig> tfs had significant enrichment of their interacting proteins when judged with physical interactions retrieved from the consensuspathdb  <cit> . in total,  <dig> different tfs were identified as being  affected by dosage imbalances. the list of tfs and their associated functional categories is given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  go categories indicate a broad impact of transcriptional regulation for neurological development, the central nervous system development , nervous system development , axonogenesis , neuron differentiation , negative regulation of neuron differentiation  and regulation of long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity and learning or memory . other prominent categories refer to organ development  and stress response .

we further analyzed the promoter sequences of the  <dig> genes for enrichment of transcription factor binding sites using the amadeus software  <cit> . significant enrichment was computed for  <dig> tf motifs, e2f <dig>  runx <dig>  staf/pax <dig> and stat <dig> . enrichment was evident for runx <dig>  which is among the most studied genes implicated in ds. the implication of e2f <dig> in ds was also previously reported  <cit>  and could be responsible for impaired cell proliferation documented for hippocampus, cerebellum and astrocytes of ds mouse models.

staf/
binding motifs have been represented using the iupac nomenclature and incorporating lower case for low frequency bases.

dosage effects and molecular interactions
molecular interactions among the  <dig> significant genes on hsa <dig> and on other chromosomes exhibited a complex network supporting the important role of physical interactions as transmitter of dosage effects . the consequences of hsa <dig> triplication on the interacting genes was fairly stable as figure 2b demonstrates. for example, dnajb <dig>  homolog, subfamily b, member 1) and ppp3ca , both interacting with sod <dig>  were consistently and significantly down-regulated in the human microarray experiments as the fold-changes and p-values indicate. opposite trends were observed for tjp <dig> and rhoq.

assessing general relevance of ds dosage effects for neurological processes
we were further interested in identifying, among the  <dig> genes, those which were relevant for other brain disorders. to achieve this, we interrogated  <dig> independent data sets derived from publicly available microarray data . these studies followed heterogeneous research questions on different cerebral pathologies and identified a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes. gene set enrichment analyses  <cit>  with the  <dig> genes and the corresponding lists of differentially expressed genes were significant for  <dig> of these  <dig> studies with  <dig> overlapping genes . furthermore, we used the hsa <dig> database http://chr <dig> molgen.mpg.de/hsa <dig> <cit> , a resource of rna in situ hybridizations in postnatal mouse brain sections, in order to provide independent supporting evidence of brain expression of these  <dig> genes as shown for example for bach <dig>  and ttc <dig>  .

additionally, we investigated the expression patterns of the  <dig> genes across the ds microarray experiments used for this meta-analysis and could identify brain-related signatures, for example, a clear up-regulation in brain tissues for the cluster containing c14orf <dig>  ivsns1abp, b2m, tpj <dig>  sparc, ctgf, col4a <dig> and fstl <dig> .

novel dosage effects
to identify ds-relevant "novel" dosage effects we excluded from the  <dig> genes  hsa <dig> genes,  genes that interacted with hsa <dig> genes, as well as  genes that were associated with ds in the literature . remaining candidates  comprised bdnf-related genes , mapk-pathway genes , genes related with leukemia  and rho-proteins . sst was found as co-expressed in previous studies with tac <dig>  <cit>  which is also significant in our meta-analysis and both showed a strong correlation across ds studies .

novel candidates are associated with neurodegenerative disorders including alzheimer's disease , prion disease  and ctr9) and age-related degeneration . moreover, candidates could explain evident ds features :  genes related to neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth  that could be related with mental retardation or cognitive impairment,  genes involved in synapsis   cytoskeletal related proteins , ckap <dig>  ckap <dig>  hat <dig>  nek <dig> and vamp3),  macular degeneration genes  <cit>  or genes  associated with age-related visual problems  <cit> ,  genes  that were related with cardiac impairments and could be candidates to explain this ds characteristic  <cit> , and  genes related with cancer   <cit> .

these examples show that the meta-analysis approach identified multiple additional genes that might be involved in ds pathology. in order to enable the community to check any particular gene of interest for ds relevance in the studies under analysis, we have agglomerated all information of the meta-analysis into a web-interface http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de/. examples of possible views and information are shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
the statistical meta-analysis approach was described previously by rasche et al.  <cit> . the score computed with meta-analysis correlates with entropy  indicating the ability to identify general dosage effects across many experiments that might be of more phenotypic relevance than very specific ones. additional file  <dig>  figures s3a and b provide an overview of the different sources of data, including two organisms , different tissues , different stages of development  and different mouse models . it is per se interesting that, in spite of such heterogeneity, common dosage effects could be identified at all and it should be highlighted that whole-genome data was fairly robust across experiments. additional file  <dig>  figure s3d shows the overall correlation of the quantitative values of pcr and microarray values averaged from all experiments with only few genes in the non-concordant sectors of the graph .

the score used in this analysis allows detecting genes that could be either up- or down-regulated in different studies. an overview of the fold-changes for the genes across the different experiments is given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  because genes might change their expression level depending on the developmental state, tissue or because of other variables, we expected that this flexibility allows checking the hypothesis of random disturbances as well as the hypothesis of increased expression of hsa <dig> genes. we detected a clear enrichment of up-regulated genes on the q-terminal part of hsa <dig> . however, not a single region was identified but rather several smaller regions on hsa <dig> that agglomerate a large amount of significant dosage effects. this finding was also elaborated before  using two independent data sets to characterize the molecular hsa <dig> regions in a set of ds-patients with partial duplications.

we studied  <dig> hsa <dig> genes matched with the probe sets from the microarrays. of these only  <dig> showed consistent dosage effects . while  <dig> hsa <dig> genes had score values different from zero indicating response in some of the microarray studies,  <dig> hsa <dig> genes were not responsive at all and provide evidence for a strong mechanism of dosage compensation. on the other hand, these figures could also reflect the limitation of detecting reliable fold-changes of low magnitude with microarray technology. furthermore, experiments covered only a limited amount of tissues so that it is likely that some genes were missed simply because they were not responsive in the tissues under analysis. however, having brain as the dominant whole-genome sample source this should ensure expression of most of the genes. microarray data was focused on the affymetrix platform in order to reduce variance arising from platform inconsistencies. we have also compared our results with additional studies including own previous research  <cit>  and others  <cit>  and found relevance of selected dosage effects with respect to other tissues as well . additional cross-validation was performed with an independent microarray data set  <cit> . these authors compared human lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ds patients and normal controls with a custom-made hsa <dig> array. yahya-graison et al.  <cit>  divided the expression ratios in four classes: class i and class ii genes were significantly up-regulated, while class iii and class iv genes were either compensated or showed variable response. our meta-analysis revealed a high-degree of concordance taking into account that the cell model, platform and the methodology used were completely different. the meta-analysis scores were significantly higher for class i and ii genes than for class iii and iv genes .  <dig> out of  <dig> class i-ii genes revealed a significant score in our meta-analysis .

in this study we monitored molecular interactions of hsa <dig> genes that might function as drivers of dosage effects . for example,  tjp <dig>  interacts with two hsa <dig> genes, jam <dig> and cldn <dig>   fos  interacts with hsa <dig> genes ets <dig>  sumo <dig>  runx <dig> and indirectly with erg,  rhoq  interacts directly with itsn <dig> and tiam <dig> and indirectly with synj, and  pik3r <dig> interacts directly with ifnar <dig> and indirectly with ifnar <dig>  it should be emphasized that current information on molecular interactions is far from complete, thus we either might miss important interactions not yet detected and/or we might count false positive interactions due to the high error rates of current annotations of interactions.

several of the ds genes  extrapolated to more general neurological phenotypes . the dendrogram  shows further interesting profiles of these genes in the ds samples under analysis:  differential gene expression in the cerebellum region versus whole "brain" or cerebrum areas which has been reported in other studies ,  different patterns of gene expression associated to particular developmental stages ; these changes were reported before by dauphinot el al.  <cit> , and  differences in es studies.

we further analyzed human and mouse studies separately and found  <dig> significant dosage effects using only human and  <dig> dosage effects using only mouse data. the venn diagram in additional file  <dig>  figure s3c clearly shows the benefit in detecting additional dosage effects when mixing the two species. overlapping dosage effects were detected for  <dig> genes with both analyses . results for the human and mouse specific analyses can be found in additional file  <dig>  tables s <dig> and s <dig>  it should be noted here that comparisons between human and mouse using microarrays are inherently difficult and have limitations since the probes for the orthologous mouse and human genes do not correspond well. furthermore, gene expression variation is generally higher in human individuals compared to mouse inbred strains. nonetheless, the  <dig> genes found in the analysis of mouse data  represent a core set of genes responsive across different ds mouse models and, thus, could be highly relevant for ds pathogenesis.

in addition to genes commonly related to ds, we have identified novel genes that can be associated with ds phenotypes, in particular with neural development and neurodegeneration. to our best knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis of genome-wide transcript levels along with other data domains in ds research. the agglomerated data can be accessed through the web server at http://ds-geneminer.molgen.mpg.de and the identified dosage effects are a resource for further functional testing and therapeutic development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a set of  <dig> genes with consistent dosage effects from  <dig> different experiments related to ds. since the meta-analysis was enriched with brain experiments, we were able to detect a high fraction of genes related to neuro-development, synapsis and neuro-degeneration. moreover, our results give more information about known and new pathways related to ds and also about  <dig> novel candidates. the results of the meta-analysis as well as the source data have been made accessible for the community through a web interface.

material and methods
selection and integration of ds resources
data sets were selected from heterogeneous technical platforms, different model systems  and different developmental stages . for each gene and for each source we computed a numerical value that measures its dosage effect. data categories were either qualitative or quantitative. qualitative data incorporated a total of  <dig> published manuscripts including reviews and semi-quantitative studies as well as two sage studies  <cit>  and were summarised to one score point in order to avoid over-scoring. here, a "1" referred to the case that the gene was found as ds relevant in one  studies. quantitative data from differential gene expression studies such as affymetrix microarrays, rt-pcr, maldi and other quantitatives techniques were evaluated in order to extract comparable information across the different studies. we considered affymetrix studies that provided the raw data . raw data were extracted from gene omnibus expression , array express  <cit>  or were retrieved from the author's web pages . furthermore, we incorporated  <dig> rt-pcr and maldi data sets for which the authors displayed the information for all genes under study .

mapping of gene ids
a central pre-requisiste of any meta-analysis approach is the consolidation of the different id types, for example coming from different organisms and from different versions of chips. we used the ensembl database  as the backbone annotation for all studies. ids were mapped to human ensembl gene ids. mapping and merging of the information was done within r and the bioconductor package. in total, information on  <dig>  ensembl genes was mapped.

mapping sage ids
differential expressed tags were extracted from additional files of the studies. identifiers  were cross-tagged with the information displayed in the updating tables  from the sage site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/sage/mappings.

transcriptome data pre-processing and normalization
we incorporated only case-control studies in the meta-analysis in order to derive expression fold-changes. affymetrix gene chip annotations were adapted from the latest genome annotation . affymetrix data were normalized with gc rma. for transcriptome case-control studies three pieces of information were stored for each gene;  the fold-change ,  the standard error of the fold-change from the replicated experiments in that study and  the expression p-value  that indicates whether or not the gene is expressed in the target samples under study. for rt-pcr and maldi experiments we computed the fold-change of the mean expression  as well as the reported standard error of the ratio. when mean and standard variation for each group  was provided we calculated the ratios as well as their associated standard errors.

scoring ds dosage effects across studies
in order to score the different categories of information such as binary counts and quantitative gene expression values, we summarized the scores of the individual experiments for each category. for microarray studies, the score of the i-th gene in the j-th study, sij, was computed as described in rasche et al.  <cit> :  

here rij is the fold-change, pij is the average detection p-value and eij is the standard error of the ratio derived from the experimental replicates of the study. thus, the fold-change is weighted with its reproducibility across the experimental replicates and with the likelihood of the gene being expressed in the study's case or control samples.

for rt-pcr and maldi studies we applied the following equation:  

here rij is the fold-change and eij is the standard error of the ratio.

the total score of the gene was computed as the sum across all individual study scores.

sampling for significance
in order to assess the significance of the overall gene scores we generated random scores by re-sampling the scores  <dig>  times with replacement within the same study. using the random distribution as background we assigned as significant those genes that were above the  <dig>  percentile of the background distribution.

judging consistency of dosage effects
for each gene, entropy of the score distribution was computed in order to quantify the relevance of the gene across many experiments. let sij be the score of the ith gene in the jth study, then ei is a measure for the uniformity of the score distribution over the individual experiments:  

high entropy is assigned to a gene if many experiments contribute to the overall score whereas low entropy is assigned if only a few experiments contribute to the overall score.

enrichment analysis
gene set enrichment analysis  of the  <dig> genes was performed with respect to pre-defined human pathways agglomerated from  <dig> pathway resources from the consensuspathdb . mostly, these experiments were performed in mouse tissues. for each study we collected one or more resulting gene lists that were evaluated using gene set enrichment analysis  against the complete list of  <dig>  genes ranked by score.
