BACKGROUND
atgrp <dig>  is an rna-binding protein with an n-terminal rna recognition motif and a c-terminal glycine-rich domain. it is under control of the circadian clock and has been implicated in stress responses and floral transition  <cit> .

the circadian clock is an endogenous timekeeping device that provides the organism with an approximately 24-hour time. the core clockwork comprises transcriptional feedback loops with positively and negatively acting proteins that directly or indirectly regulate their own expression and thus generate their own 24-h rhythm  <cit> . the core oscillator is composed of interconnected morning and evening loops. in the morning loop, the two myb-type transcription factors cca <dig>  and lhy  activate two pseudo response regulators, prr <dig> and prr <dig> that feed back to repress cca <dig> and lhy  <cit> . in the evening loop, toc <dig>  represses gi  which in turn contributes to toc <dig> activation  <cit> . in shoots, these two loops are interlocked through reciprocal regulation of cca1/lhy and toc <dig>  <cit> .

the core oscillator imparts rhythmicity on downstream transcripts to generate output rhythms. among those transcripts is atgrp <dig> which oscillates with a peak in the evening and is directly controlled by the cca <dig> and lhy clock proteins  <cit> . notably, atgrp <dig> itself influences the oscillations of its own transcript at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . atgrp <dig> binds to its own pre-mrna and promotes the formation of an alternatively spliced transcript that retains part of the intron including a premature termination codon  <cit> . this unproductively spliced transcript form is short-lived and is degraded via the nonsense-mediated decay  pathway  <cit> . apart from this atgrp <dig> also influences the atgrp <dig> transcript encoding a related rna-binding protein. this negative feedback loop is thought to represent a slave oscillator as part of clock output signalling  <cit> .

rna-binding proteins are involved in almost all aspects of rna metabolism. upon transcription and throughout their life, mrnas are bound by a suite of proteins that define pre-mrna processing, lifetime, export from the nucleus and translation  <cit> . in higher plants, rna-binding proteins perform a crucial role in key developmental processes such as floral transition and flower development or stress tolerance  <cit> . the targets of these rna-binding proteins and their mode of action are known in only a few cases, however  <cit> .

in order to obtain insights into cellular processes atgrp <dig> may be involved in we set out to globally identify potential atgrp <dig> target transcripts. about  <dig> transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in plants constitutively overexpressing atgrp <dig> . about one third of these are controlled by the circadian clock and they show a certain bias towards specific circadian phases. furthermore, transcripts associated with responses to stress and to abiotic or biotic stimuli were prevalent. monitoring for enrichment of gene sets revealed that components associated with various aspects of rna metabolism predominate among transcripts with higher abundance in atgrp7-ox plants.

RESULTS
identification of genes differentially expressed in plants constitutively over-expressing atgrp7
transcripts regulated by the rna-binding protein atgrp <dig> are expected to have altered expression levels in transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing atgrp <dig>  as observed for endogenous atgrp <dig> whose abundance is depressed by the elevated atgrp <dig> protein level  <cit> . therefore, differences in the mrna complement of wt and atgrp7-ox plants were analyzed on the affymetrix ath <dig> microarray. to filter out any line- or accession-specific effects, independent transgenic lines in the c <dig> background, line rs <dig>  <cit> , and in the col background, line g  <cit> , were assayed. transgenic lines and the wild types were grown in parallel in long days  and harvested at the circadian maximum of atgrp <dig> expression .

the rankproduct algorithm was employed to compare transcript profiles of the atgrp7-ox lines to the respective wild types  <cit> . transcripts corresponding to  <dig> probe sets were present at an elevated level in atgrp7-ox plants  and  <dig> were present at a reduced level  with a signal log ratio >  <dig>  in all three experiments . among the transcripts most strongly reduced in atgrp7-ox plants was atgrp <dig> previously shown to be under negative control by atgrp <dig>  <cit> , validating the strategy.

overrepresentation of circadian transcripts among atgrp <dig> targets
to determine the proportion of rhythmic transcripts among the atgrp <dig> targets, we compared the differentially expressed genes to a published dataset scoring  <dig> % of the arabidopsis genes as circadian-regulated  <cit> . in this experiment, eight-day-old seedlings were entrained in 12-hr-light/12-hr-dark cycles before transfer to constant light and harvested at 4-hr-intervals, starting  <dig> h after the last dark-light transition. thus, subjective dawn corresponds to zt <dig> and zt <dig>  respectively, and subjective dusk corresponds to zt <dig>  atgrp <dig>  also named ccr <dig> , peaked around zt <dig> in this experiment. among the transcripts we found to be differentially expressed in atgrp7-ox plants rhythmic transcripts are significantly enriched.  <dig> of the  <dig> probe sets with elevated levels in atgrp7-ox, corresponding to  <dig> %   and  <dig> of the  <dig> probe sets with reduced levels corresponding to  <dig> %   are among those classified as rhythmic in the edwards dataset. edwards and coworkers have shown a nearly uniform distribution of the peaks across all time points  implicating a complex network downstream of the core oscillator in conveying different phases upon clock-controlled output genes. notably, the genes differentially expressed in atgrp7-ox are biased toward specific circadian phases. a large fraction of transcripts with reduced level in atgrp7-ox mainly peaks between zt <dig> and zt <dig>  in the second half of the subjective day . this suggests that atgrp <dig> has a mostly negative effect on transcripts oscillating with a similar phase. conversely, transcripts upregulated in atgrp7-ox mainly peak between zt <dig> and zt <dig> in the edwards dataset , i.e. towards the end of the subjective night and thus in antiphase to atgrp <dig> 

to determine how atgrp <dig> affects rhythmic downstream genes, oscillations of selected candidate target transcripts were compared between wt and atgrp7-ox plants under free-running conditions. plants were grown in long days for two weeks and subsequently transferred to continuous light and harvested at 3-h intervals for three days. salt tolerance homologue  encoding a b-box zinc finger protein  <cit>  which shows a mean slr of  <dig>  in all three atgrp7-ox vs. wt comparisons at zt <dig> oscillates with a maximum around subjective dawn both in wt and atgrp7-ox plants . in the atgrp7-ox plants, the sth peak is higher and broader while the phase is maintained. hy5-homolog  encoding a bzip transcription factor involved in phyb signalling  <cit>  which shows a mean slr of  <dig>  in all three atgrp7-ox vs. wt comparisons at zt <dig>  oscillates at a higher level in atgrp7-ox plants.

characterization of non-circadian transcripts among atgrp <dig> targets
the observation that one third of atgrp <dig> targets are clock-controlled is in line with a function of the atgrp <dig> feedback loop in clock output but the fact that two thirds are not classified as rhythmic  <cit>  points to additional processes atgrp <dig> may be involved in. the distribution of genes into ontology categories corresponding to plant goslim revealed that the categories "response to stress" and "response to abiotic or biotic stimulus" were significantly enriched among transcripts with reduced levels in atgrp7-ox plants  and were also prevalent among transcripts with elevated levels . further, significant enrichment among transcripts with reduced abundance in atgrp7-ox was found for transcripts upregulated by the phytohormones methyl jasmonate  and abscisic acid .

to validate a differential expression of these candidate targets, a suite of them was monitored in several independent atgrp7-ox plants and the corresponding wt plants using rt-pcr and realtime pcr on zt <dig> rna. the transcripts encoding the pathogenesis-related proteins pr <dig>  pr <dig> encoding a Î²-glucanase and pr <dig> encoding an antimicrobial thaumatin-like protein are present at elevated levels in atgrp7-ox plants . because two cold- and aba-regulated transcripts, rd29a  and rab <dig>  were confirmed to have reduced levels in atgrp7-ox plants , we tested another cold-induced transcript, cor15a, which was also reduced in atgrp7-ox plants . transcripts encoding the plant defensins pdf <dig>  and pdf <dig> a, rap <dig> /erf72/atebp encoding a member of the ethylene response factor subfamily b <dig> of ap2-domain transcription factors implicated in pdf <dig> a activation  <cit>  and the antimicrobial thionin thi <dig>  are present at reduced levels in atgrp7-ox plants .

because methyl jasmonate -induced transcripts were overrepresented among genes with reduced levels in atgrp7-ox plants, we investigated a potential role of atgrp <dig> in the response of the atgrp <dig> target gene pdf <dig> a to mej treatment. pdf <dig> a accumulated  <dig> hrs after addition of mej both in wt and independent atgrp7-ox plants . pdf <dig> a levels in mej-treated atgrp7-ox plants still remained lower than in mej treated wt plants. thus, overexpression of atgrp <dig> does not prevent the response to mej but mej does not overcome the negative regulation by atgrp <dig> 

we have shown previously that site-specific mutation of a single arginine to glutamine within the rna recognition motif impairs both in vitro binding of recombinant atgrp <dig> to its pre-mrna and in vivo function  <cit> . therefore we investigated the steady-state abundance of selected putative atgrp <dig> targets in transgenic plants constitutively overexpressing the mutant protein . real time pcr showed that levels of pr <dig>  pr <dig>  thi <dig>  and rd29a remained similar to wt levels in plants harvested at zt <dig> . for hyh and sth with a morning peak, plants were harvested at zt <dig>  again, hyh and sth levels remained similar to wt levels . the fact that the candidate targets were affected by high levels of the authentic atgrp <dig> protein but not of the mutant protein indicates that the regulation is based on the atgrp <dig> rna-binding activity. nevertheless, this does not unambiguously imply direct binding of atgrp <dig> to these transcripts, as overexpression of regulatory rna-binding proteins, similar to the overexpression of transcription factors leads to direct and indirect effects on the transcriptome. to begin to understand how atgrp <dig> may influence the differentially expressed transcripts we assessed their steady-state abundance in the atgrp7- <dig> t-dna insertion line that lacks atgrp <dig>  <cit> . pr <dig> and pr <dig> transcript levels were reduced in atgrp7- <dig>  suggesting that their expression closely correlates with the atgrp <dig> level .

also hyh and sth levels were weakly reduced at the time of their circadian maximum. the levels of thi <dig>  and rd29a remained mostly unchanged and levels of pdf <dig>  and pdf <dig> a were reduced in atgrp7- <dig>  suggesting either that elevated atgrp <dig> levels have a slightly negative effect but reduced atgrp <dig> levels are not sufficient to cause their upregulation or that they are influenced indirectly.

analysis of gene set enrichment
overall, changes in expression of most candidate target genes were moderate . therefore we subjected the expression data to page   <cit> , an improved tool to analyze overrepresentation of groups of genes that employs predefined gene sets. it relies on the assumption that differential expression manifests itself more clearly at the level of coregulated genes than at the level of individual genes. thus, page is a complementary approach to uncover genes differentially expressed with a small fold change . its significance comes from the possibility to detect entire gene sets, with narrower definition than go categories, that are co-ordinately up- or down-regulated to a small degree.

most prominent among gene sets upregulated in atgrp7-ox plants were structural constituents of the ribosome and functions associated with ribosome biogenesis and assembly . the next categories were rna binding and small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complexes, followed by rrna processing, nucleolus and rna splicing including the sr  proteins rsz <dig> and rsz <dig>  this may point to an involvement of the rna-binding protein atgrp <dig> in the modulation of rna processing and translational activity. two transcripts encoding proteins participating in pre-mrna splicing, the snrnp core protein d <dig> and the u <dig> snrnp helicase , were confirmed to be expressed at higher levels in independent atgrp7-ox lines . transcripts with reduced abundance in atgrp7-ox comprise functions associated with chloroplasts . this may relate to the observation of a slightly reduced chlorophyll content in atgrp7-ox plants .

discussion
transcript profiling has identified about  <dig> transcripts with altered expression in transgenic lines overexpressing the clock regulated rna-binding protein atgrp <dig>  gratifyingly, among the transcripts most strongly reduced in atgrp7-ox plants is atgrp <dig> previously shown to be under negative control by atgrp <dig>  <cit> , validating the strategy used to identify candidate targets.

one third of the differentially expressed genes are controlled by the circadian clock, in line with the proposed function of the atgrp <dig> feedback loop as a slave oscillator in clock output  <cit> . binding of the morning-phased lhy and cca <dig> clock proteins to the promoters of some morning-specific genes shows that rhythmic transcripts can be directly controlled by the core oscillator proteins  <cit> . other oscillating transcripts presumably are regulated via signalling intermediates that receive timing cues from the circadian clock and in turn convey rhythmicity upon downstream transcripts  <cit> . for example, circadian oscillations of the myb factor early phytochrome responsive  <dig>  are controlled by cca <dig> and lhy  <cit> . epr <dig> negatively autoregulates, presumably at the transcriptional level and moreover activates the morning-specific lhc  genes. thus, epr <dig> may represent a slave oscillator downstream of the core oscillator that contributes to a phase-specific transcriptional program  <cit> . atgrp <dig> is the first example of a molecular slave oscillator that autoregulates at the posttranscriptional level. notably, the rhythmic transcripts that are affected by atgrp <dig> overexpression show a distinct phase bias: the up-regulated transcripts preferentially peak around dawn, roughly opposite to the atgrp <dig> peak abundance whereas the down-regulated transcripts preferentially peak at the end of the day . in accordance with this, the morning-phased sth and hyh transcripts show higher peak levels in an extended time course over three days in ll . previously, we have found that the atgrp <dig> transcript, which cycles in phase with atgrp <dig>  is strongly downregulated in atgrp7-ox plants but also retains rhythmicity over three days in ll  <cit> . to begin to understand the relation between the core oscillator and the atgrp <dig> slave oscillator and their respective downstream transcripts, we monitored recently published datasets for the phase distribution of transcripts controlled by toc <dig> and lhy with reference to the edwards dataset  <cit> . transcripts that are elevated in toc1-ox plants at zt <dig> in  <dig> h light- <dig> h dark cycles  <cit>  peak in the second half of the night, i.e. at time points opposite to toc <dig> itself , and transcripts with reduced abundance have a more uniform phase distribution throughout the light phase with a bias towards the evening, similar to toc <dig> . from the datasets comparing lhy plants expressing elevated lhy levels grown in  <dig> h light- <dig> h dark cycles to wt we chose zt <dig> when lhy peaks  <cit> . of  <dig> transcripts elevated in lhy,  <dig> are rhythmic with peaks roughly opposite to lhy itself . of  <dig> transcripts reduced in lhy,  <dig> are rhythmic with a broad distribution during the night and around dawn. thus, both atgrp <dig> and toc <dig> with preferential expression in the evening as well as lhy with a dawn peak have a bias towards negatively affecting the abundance of similarly phased transcripts and positively affecting the abundance of oppositely phased transcripts. to obtain a detailed picture of the rna networks controlled by core and slave oscillators, respectively, further transcript profiling of plants mis-expressing the components harvested under identical photoperiods around the clock will be required.

pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> which are expressed at elevated levels in independent transgenic atgrp7-ox lines are associated with salicylic acid -mediated defence pathways  <cit> . conversely, pdf <dig> a encoding a plant defensin, a target of jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling, and rap <dig>  encoding an ethylene response factor implicated in pdf <dig> a activation are expressed at reduced levels in atgrp7-ox. thus, high atgrp <dig> levels correlate with increased expression of sa-responsive pr transcripts and decreased expression of the ja-responsive transcripts. antagonisms between the sa and ja pathways were observed during defence responses  <cit> . notably, the atgrp7- <dig> mutant lacking atgrp <dig> shows increased susceptibility to pseudomonas syringae dc <dig>  <cit> . atgrp <dig> is adp-ribosylated by the pseudomonas syringae type iii effector protein hopu <dig>  this modification depends on the conserved arginine residue that is crucial for rna binding activity and in vivo function and is suggested to interfere with a defence-related function of atgrp <dig>  <cit> . whether the elevated levels of pr <dig>  pr <dig> and pr <dig> in atgrp7-ox plants may point to a role of atgrp <dig> in processing of defence-related transcripts remains to be tested. alternatively, the hormonal balance could be altered in these plants and cause a general stress response. in line with this, overexpression of atgrp <dig> entails reduced levels of the ja-responsive pdf <dig> a but does not prevent its induction by mej . our data also indicate that transcripts regulated by the phytohormone aba are prevalent among atgrp <dig> targets. previously a considerable overlap of the circadian transcriptome with aba-related genes has been noted  <cit> .

the observation that several target transcripts are affected by elevated levels of the authentic atgrp <dig> but not of the atgrp7-rq mutant protein shows that the effect depends on the rna-binding activity. negative regulation in atgrp7-ox plants but not atgrp7-rq-ox plants has been observed for the endogenous atgrp <dig> and atgrp <dig> transcripts  <cit> . both are regulated post-transcriptionally via binding of atgrp <dig> to the pre-mrnas that entails alternative splicing and degradation through nmd  <cit> . it seems conceivable that atgrp <dig> may interact with similar binding sites in some of the candidate target transcripts, thus controlling their stability or splicing.

so far, a minimal atgrp <dig> binding site identified in its 3'utr  <cit>  was not found to be prevalent in the 5'utrs or 3'utrs of either the upregulated or downregulated transcripts . however, computational identification of rna substrates based on conserved binding motifs is not straightforward because in addition to the sequence context structural features of the rna are relevant. thus, programs for rna sequence alignment have to be informed by structure  <cit> . to unequivocally demonstrate direct regulation, in vivo binding of the targets by atgrp <dig> will have to be demonstrated by precipitating atgrp7-containing mrnp particles from transgenic plants expressing epitope-tagged atgrp <dig> and identification of co-precipitated transcripts.

transcripts that are controlled directly by atgrp <dig> may be affected in the opposite way by reduced levels of atgrp <dig>  several transcripts such as pr <dig> and pr <dig> that show higher levels in atgrp7-ox indeed are present at reduced levels in the atgrp7- <dig> t-dna insertion line  <cit> . several other transcripts that are altered in atgrp7-ox plants remain at wt levels in atgrp7- <dig> or are even changed in the same direction. this may indicate that they respond to elevated levels of atgrp <dig> but that atgrp <dig> is not limiting. alternatively, altered steady-state abundance could also be a secondary consequence of atgrp <dig> overexpression, but nevertheless may be biologically meaningful. for example, it could result from changes in transcription rate as a consequence of modulation of activators or repressors. this could be assessed by measuring the effect of a high atgrp <dig> concentration upon promoter-reporter gene constructs.

constitutive overexpression of atgrp <dig> promotes the transition to flowering  <cit> . in the present comparison between atgrp7-ox and wt plants transcripts related to flowering time control are not prevalent. presumably target transcripts associated with the role of atgrp <dig> in floral transition have not been identified in the long-day grown plants because the floral promotive effect of atgrp <dig> manifests itself mostly under short-day conditions  <cit> .

overall, in the atgrp7-ox plants only  <dig> % of the transcripts present on the ath <dig> chip are altered, and the changes are moderate . in addition to posttranscriptional regulation atgrp <dig> may exert control on downstream targets also at the translational level which is not revealed by transcript profiling. in line with this, gene sets comprising structural components of ribosomes and functions associated with ribosome biogenesis and assembly are enriched among transcripts elevated in atgrp7-ox plants. notably, in chlamydomonas reinhardtii the clock-regulated rna-binding protein chlamy <dig> has been shown to repress translation of enzymes involved in co2- and n-metabolism  <cit> . that rna-binding proteins affect multiple facets of post-transcriptional control is not without precedent: polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, also known as hnrnp i, binds pyrimidine-rich regions in introns to regulate alternative splicing but also is responsible for time-of-day dependent degradation of the mrna encoding the mammalian clock gene period <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
expression of the rna-binding protein atgrp <dig> is trigged by the circadian clock. in turn, it affects accumulation of rhythmic transcripts in a time-of-day dependent manner: transcripts peaking in the evening like atgrp <dig> itself mainly are expressed at reduced levels in atgrp7-ox plants whereas transcripts peaking in the morning mainly are expressed at elevated levels . further, atgrp <dig> directly and indirectly affects a suite of other transcripts including hormone responsive and pathogenesis-related and cold-regulated transcripts. based on these findings, atgrp <dig> is placed in clock output signalling, transducing timing information from the circadian clock upon downstream targets. additionally, atgrp <dig> that itself is influence by external stimuli including cold appears to be embedded in an environmental response network .
