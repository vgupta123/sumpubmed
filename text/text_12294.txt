BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis  is an important pathogen of pigs that causes high mortality and is responsible for considerable economic loss to the porcine industry  <cit> . serotype  <dig> is considered the most virulent form of the bacteria and is the serotype most frequently isolated from diseased animals  <cit> . s. suis  <dig> is also an emerging zoonotic agent and has been isolated from a wide range of mammalian species, including humans, who are often infected via skin wounds during contact with pigs and their products  <cit> . s. suis  <dig> is frequently isolated from asymptomatic pigs, especially adult pigs , which indicates that pigs can be carriers of s. suis  <dig>  two outbreaks in humans have been documented in china, in  <dig> and 2005; hundreds of people were infected and  <dig> died. human illness following s. suis infection has also been reported in thailand  <cit> , the united kingdom  <cit> , the netherlands  <cit> , australia  <cit>  and the united states  <cit> . moreover, in hong kong, infection with s. suis is the third most common cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and in vietnam it is the leading cause of meningitis in adult humans  <cit> .

previous studies of the pathogenesis of s. suis infection focused on the virulence factors of s. suis  <dig>  the capsular polysaccharide , muramidase-released protein , extracellular protein factor  and suilysin  are considered to be virulence-associated factors that play an important role in the process of infection with s. suis  <dig>  in the chinese strains, an  <dig> kb pathogenicity island  was found which has not been detected in other s. suis isolates  <cit> .

essentially, the disease is the result of the interaction between the bacteria and the host, and we believe further investigation of the host response to infection with s. suis  <dig> will help us to better understand the disease. several previous studies have shown that s. suis  <dig> can adhere to various types of epithelial cell  <cit>  and to microvascular endothelial cells from porcine brain  <cit> . in addition, the response of alveolar macrophages to s. suis  <dig> infection is associated with induction of the nuclear factor-kappa b  and map-kinase signaling pathways. further study has found that thp- <dig> cells respond to infection with s. suis  <dig> by changes in the level of expression of tlr <dig> and cd <dig>  the toll-like receptors  have been shown to recognize a wide range of microbial components and mediate responding cellular signaling. cd <dig> has been shown to be important in the recognition of lps   <cit> . the cd <dig> receptor is also known to interact with members of the tlr family. the receptors share common signaling pathways that trigger the association of adaptor molecules, such as myeloid differentiation factor  <dig> , with several kinases, leading to the nuclear translocation of nf-κb. these findings indicate that these pattern recognition receptors may play a role in the host interaction with s. suis  <dig>  the purpose of our studies was to evaluate the interaction of the pbmc, brain and lung of pigs with s. suis  <dig>  and thereby facilitate further investigations on the pathogenesis of s. suis  <dig> 

RESULTS
transcription analysis
in this study, differential gene expression was investigated among the three tissues studied . transcript analysis indicated that at least  <dig> % and up to  <dig> % of the probe sets were well detected in all  <dig> samples. the criteria of fold change  ≥  <dig> and p value ≤ <dig>  were considered to indicate up-regulation; fc ≤  <dig>  and p ≤  <dig>  were considered to represent down-regulation. genes whose relative transcription levels were between  <dig>  and  <dig> were considered to show no significant change. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> genes in the brain showed changes, including  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated. there were  <dig> genes were changed in the lung,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> genes were changed in pbmc,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. the expression of  <dig> genes was found to change in response to infection in all three tissues, comprising  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated.

all differentially expressed  genes were annotated on the basis of the gene ontology  database using visualization and integrated discovery . in brain tissue, of the  <dig> de transcripts,  <dig> were annotated by david and these represented  <dig> unique genes. in the lung,  <dig> transcripts were annotated, which represented  <dig> unique genes of the  <dig> de transcripts. in pbmc, of the  <dig> de transcripts,  <dig> transcripts were annotated and represented  <dig> unique genes.

quantitative rt-pcr to validate the microarray data
to validate the de genes identified in the microarray data, quantitative rt-pcr  analysis was performed on the same samples that were used in the microarray. three up-regulated genes and two down-regulated genes were selected for validation . the three up-regulated genes analyzed were cd <dig> , icam- <dig>  and tlr2; all three showed higher expression in infected groups tissues than in the control groups. of the two down-regulated genes analyzed, vegfa  was found to be down-regulated in the lung and ttr  was found to be down-regulated in the brain and pbmc. contrasting results were seen for vegfa in the brain and pbmc and ttr in the lung. these contradictions between the qrt-pcr results and the microarray may arise from the qrt-pcr technique being more sensitive and accurate or that the primer design methods and the dynamic range were different.

induction of genes related to the innate immune response
analysis of the expression of porcine genes in three tissues after infection with s. suis  <dig> showed that a large set of de genes is involved in the immune response. tlr signaling plays an essential role in the innate immune response. tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig>  both belong to the tlr family and are expressed most abundantly in peripheral blood leukocytes. they mediate the host response to gram-positive bacteria and play a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. another receptor for bacteria, cd <dig>  recognizes lps of gram-negative bacteria and cooperates with tlr <dig>  via myd <dig>  leading to inflammatory responses. in addition, ly <dig>   plays a role in the recognition of lps together with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  moreover, cd <dig> has also been found to recognize peptidoglycan  of gram-positive bacteria and to be were associated with ss <dig>  <cit> . the signal transducer myd <dig>  is an adapter for almost all tlr  signaling pathways, and acts via interferon regulatory factor  <dig> , leading to activation of nf-kappa-b, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response. cxcl <dig>  ligand  <dig>  otherwise known as mig; up-regulated  <dig> -fold in brain and  <dig> -fold in lung) is thought to be induced by gamma interferon  and binds to cxcr <dig>  which activates the chemotactic functions of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> 

induction of genes associated with the inflammatory response
the inflammatory response is part of the initial defensive reaction against infection or injury caused by chemical or physical agents. several de genes in this study are involved in the inflammatory response, including cd <dig>  amcf-ii, ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  the expression of hemoglobin scavenger receptor cd <dig>  was up-regulated more than 4-fold in all three tissues. this has been identified as a receptor that might play a role in immunoregulation and may be a valuable diagnostic parameter for monitoring macrophage activation in inflammatory conditions. another scavenger receptor, amcf-ii , has chemotactic activity for porcine cells and can be induced by lps. it belongs to the intercrine alpha  family; its new designation is cxcl <dig> and the gene symbol is scyb <dig>  cytokine ccl <dig>  ligand  <dig>  up-regulated  <dig> -fold in brain) is thought to bind to chemokine receptors ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  ccl <dig>  ligand  <dig>  up-regulated  <dig> -fold in brain and  <dig> -fold in lung) is a cc chemokine with specificity for ccr <dig>  receptors. cd1d  encodes a divergent member of the cd <dig> family of transmembrane glycoproteins, which are structurally related to the major histocompatibility complex  proteins and form heterodimers with beta-2-microglobulin .

genes associated with cell adhesion
cell adhesion molecules  perform various functions in fundamental cellular processes, including polarization, movement, proliferation and survival  <cit> . we discovered several de genes that were related to cell adhesion during s. suis  <dig> infection, including cd <dig>  icam- <dig>  icam- <dig>  vcam- <dig>  sele, sell and selp. cd <dig>  is a monomeric cell surface antigen that is expressed selectively on human hematopoietic progenitor cells. it plays a role in early hematopoiesis by mediating the attachment of stem cells to the bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells, and was found as a carbohydrate ligand for selectins. in addition, vcam <dig>  is a type i membrane protein that is important in cell-cell recognition, and mediates leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and signal transduction. icam proteins are type i transmembrane glycoproteins that bind to the leukocyte adhesion protein lfa- <dig>  icam- <dig>  is typically expressed on endothelial cells and cells of the immune system and binds to integrins of type cd11a/cd <dig>  or cd11b/cd <dig>  it alters shear stress stimulated up-regulation of endothelial vcam- <dig> and icam- <dig> in a bmp- <dig> and tgf-beta1-dependent pathway. in addition, icam- <dig>  plays a role in the cellular interactions associated with xenograft rejection, by blocking lfa-1-dependent cell adhesion in lymphocyte recirculation, and mediates adhesive interactions that are important for antigen-specific immune responses and surveillance. another cam, cd <dig> , is a receptor for icam <dig>  icam <dig>  icam <dig> and icam <dig>  and combines with itgam or itgax to form a leukocyte-specific integrin called macrophage receptor  <dig> , or inactivated-c3b  receptor  <dig> .

the selectins are ca2+-dependent cams that bind fucosylated carbohydrates. sele  encodes proteins that are found in cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells and is thought to mediate the adhesion of blood neutrophils to cytokine-activated endothelium through interaction with psgl1/selplg. sell  is a cell surface adhesion protein which mediates the adherence of lymphocytes to endothelial cells of high endothelial venules in peripheral lymph nodes and promotes the initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes in endothelia. selp  encodes a  <dig> kda protein that is stored in the alpha-granules of platelets and weibel-palade bodies of endothelial cells, and mediates the interaction of activated endothelial cells or platelets with leukocytes.

antigen processing and presentation
antigen processing and presentation is performed by antigen presenting cells that express antigen  on their cell surface in association with an mhc protein complex. the mhc protein complex is a transmembrane protein complex composed of an mhc alpha chain and, in most cases, either an mhc class ii beta chain or an invariant beta2-microglobin chain, with or without a bound peptide, lipid or polysaccharide antigen. multiple mhc proteins were identified as de genes after infection with s. suis  <dig>  sla- <dig>  is involved in the presentation of foreign antigens to cells of the immune system. sla- <dig>  is similar to the gene hla-g of homo sapiens. sla-dra  is similar to hla-dra, does not have polymorphisms in the peptide binding portion and acts as the sole alpha chain for drb <dig>  drb <dig>  drb <dig> and drb <dig>  sla-drb <dig>  contains all the polymorphisms that specify the peptide binding and is present in all individuals. the protein encoded by sla-dqa <dig> , and sla-dqb <dig>  are two proteins that are required to form the dq heterodimer, similar to hla-dqa <dig> and hla-dqb <dig>  sbab-1044b <dig>   is similar to hla-dmb and is located in intracellular vesicles, plays a critical role in catalyzing the release of class ii-associated invariant chain peptide  from newly synthesized mhc class ii molecules and frees the peptide binding site for acquisition of antigenic peptides. in b cells, the interaction between hla-dm and mhc class ii molecules is regulated by hla-do. sla-doa  was 3-fold up-regulated in brain. tap <dig> , up-regulated  <dig> -fold in brain and  <dig> -fold in lung) belongs to the abc  transporter family, is involved in the transport of antigens from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum for association with mhc class i molecules, and acts as a molecular scaffold for the final stage of mhc class i folding, namely the binding of peptide.

cytokine activity
cytokines function in control of the survival, growth, differentiation and effector function of tissues and cells that participate in the immune and inflammatory responses. interleukins are a group of cytokines that are produced by white blood cells  and a wide variety of somatic cells. monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells promote the development and differentiation of t, b and other hematopoietic cells, and play an important role in the immune system. the results of this study showed that il1a was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in pbmc. il1b was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in lung. il <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in lung. il <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in lung. il12b was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in pbmc and  <dig> -fold in lung. il <dig> was up-regulated 3-fold in brain. il <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in lung. il10rb  belongs to the cytokine receptor family; coexpression with il10ra proteins has been shown to be required for il10-induced signal transduction. tnf-a  is a cytokine secreted mainly by macrophages, which is involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, and cancer. cd <dig>  is a member of the tnf-receptor superfamily and mediates a variety of immune and inflammatory responses. sr-psox , up-regulated  <dig> -fold in pbmc) is a scavenger receptor on macrophages, binds to cxcr6/bonzo and binds specifically to oxldl, which suggests that it may induce a strong chemotactic response and induce calcium mobilization.

furthermore, many cytokines are involved in signaling systems. stat <dig> , stat <dig> , stat <dig>  and stat5a  belong to the stat family, which is usually activated by janus kinase  and dysregulation. they regulate growth, survival and differentiation in cells. jak <dig>  is required for the response to ifn-γ. ikbkg , also known as nemo and ikk-γ, is the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of the iκb kinase  complex and interacts with ikk-alpha and ikk-beta to activate nuclear factor-kappa-b and other pathways. nfkbia  is one member of a family of cellular proteins that inhibit the nf-κb transcription factor. tgfb <dig>  is a member of the transforming growth factor beta  family of cytokines, which are multifunctional peptides that regulate proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and other functions in many cell types. tbk <dig>  is similar to ikb kinases and can mediate nfkb activation, including the phosphorylation and activation of irf <dig> and irf <dig> 

angiogenesis
angiogenesis is a biological process of blood vessel formation in which new vessels emerge from the proliferation of pre-existing blood vessels. vegf is a growth factor that induces endothelial cell proliferation, promotes cell migration, inhibits apoptosis and induces permeabilization of blood vessels. it was down-regulated  <dig> -fold in pbmc and  <dig> -fold in lung. two other angiopoietic factors that were down-regulated in lung in our study were angpt <dig> and its receptor tek . angpt <dig> can activate tie <dig> by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation, and participates in the endothelial developmental processes later than and distinct from vegf. it plays a crucial role in mediating the interactions of endothelium and the surrounding matrix and mesenchyme, and also mediates blood vessel maturation/stability  <cit> . these results indicate that infection with s. suis  <dig> may influence the maturation and stability of blood vessels.

discussion
streptococcus suis infection is considered a major problem in the global pig industry and has caused mass mortality in pigs, particularly during the past  <dig> years  <cit> . studies of the pathogenesis of this infection have generally used human macrophages, porcine choroid plexus epithelial cells  or porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells to investigate the host response to s. suis  <dig> in vitro. recently, li et al. analyzed swine spleen infected with ss <dig>  <cit> . while these results strengthened our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of the bacterium, the mechanism of the interaction between s. suis  <dig> and the host remained unclear. in this study we investigated changes in gene expression in the brain, lung and pbmc of pigs in response to s. suis  <dig> infection.

differential expression in all three tissues
our analysis found  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed in infected and non-infected brain, lung and pbmc . most of these genes were associated with the innate immune system. in previous studies, cd <dig> has been discovered to be a cellular receptor for prrsv in cd <dig> positive cells and to mediate viral entry and uncoating  <cit> . other studies have revealed that cd <dig> can be a macrophage receptor for the binding of bacteria  <cit>  and that it can promote bacteria-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines during infection  <cit> . these findings indicate that cd <dig> may have a function in microbial infection. a further study showed that cd <dig> was associated with s. suis  <dig> infection  <cit> . however, the function of cd <dig> in this setting was unclear. in our study, up-regulated expression of cd <dig> was detected in all three infected tissues. other studies have shown that up-regulation of cd <dig> can be induced by il- <dig> and il- <dig>  and concomitantly influenced by multiple cytokines  <cit> . in addition, expression of cd <dig> increases along the pathway of macrophage differentiation  <cit> . although il- <dig> and il- <dig> are known to be induced by tlr <dig>  their up-regulation also affects cd <dig> up-regulation  <cit> . human tlr <dig> can associate with cd <dig> and play an important role in ss <dig> infection  <cit> . given that cd <dig>  tlr <dig> and cd <dig> were all found to be up-regulated in our study, in combination with other cytokines , we demonstrate that these genes are involved in s. suis  <dig> infections. the function of cd <dig> in s. suis  <dig> infection invites further research.


cytokines, including tnf-α, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  have been shown to play an important role in septic shock  <cit> , and were found in the present study to be significantly differentially expressed in pbmc after infection with s. suis  <dig>  moreover, several scavenger receptor genes were differentially expressed in pbmc after infection with s. suis  <dig>  when compared with brain and lung. sr-psox  and scarb <dig> were up-regulated only in pbmc. cxcr <dig>  up-regulated in both lung and pbmc, is a ligand for cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and its ligand cxcr <dig>  are involved in interactions of dc with t cells and in the regulation of t cell migration in the red pulp of the spleen; they are up-regulated by inflammatory mediators  <cit> . cxcl <dig> is a biomarker of inflammatory bowel disease and diseases such as sarcoidosis and atherosclerosis. it is possible that the scavenger receptor may play an important role in the effects of s. suis  <dig> infection, especially septicemia. another gene, vegf, is a growth factor that is active in angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth. in our study, this gene was down-regulated, which suggests that s. suis  <dig> infection may suppress vasculogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation and cell migration, and may enhance the production of septicemia by inhibition of vegf expression,

genes differentially expressed in brain
meningitis is another important clinical manifestation of s. suis  <dig> infection. after s. suis  <dig> bacteria enter the bloodstream, they cause an overwhelming sepsis that enables s. suis  <dig> to pass between or through the cells that form the blood-brain barrier , allowing s. suis  <dig> to disseminate in the central nervous system .

in our results, several genes involved in antigen processing and presentation  <cit>  showed differential expression in porcine brain after s. suis  <dig> infection, but were unchanged in pbmc and lung tissues. these genes belonged mainly to the class of swine leukocyte antigens , which is also called the swine major histocompatibility complex . recent research has demonstrated that sla molecules play an important role in porcine immune responses to pathogens and vaccines  <cit> .

class i molecules, such as sla- <dig>  are found on almost all cells and present proteins to cytotoxic t cells. they are thought to be recognized by xenoantigens  <cit>  and have been implicated in human xenotransplantation  <cit>  and cancer diseases such as porcine melanoma  <cit> . class ii molecules are found on certain immune cells, chiefly antigen-presenting cells  such as macrophages and b cells. they recognize non-self molecules, present the fragments to helper t cells, and stimulate an immune reaction. class ii molecules include sla-dra, sla-drb <dig>  sla-dqa <dig>  sla-dqb <dig>  sla-dmb and sla-doa. sla class ii also has a function in csfv   <cit> , prrsv   <cit> , and fmdv   <cit>  infections in pigs. in addition, cytokines such as tnf-α, ifn-γ and il- <dig> have been shown to regulate the expression of mhc class i and ii antigens on transplanted organs that are involved in immune responses  <cit> . human leukocyte antigens  have been proven to be associated with many diseases, and can inhibit lysis of nk cells in hiv infection by interacting with their inhibitory receptors  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulated expression of cytokines and swine mhc molecules  may play an important role during s. suis  <dig> infection.

genes differentially expressed in lung
pneumonia is another important clinical manifestation of s. suis  <dig> infection. s. suis  <dig> can adhere to many cells in vitro, including several types of epithelial cell, porcine brain microvascular endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages  <cit> . before it breaks through the epithelial cell barrier to enter the bloodstream, s. suis  <dig> naturally colonizes the upper respiratory tract of pigs, particularly the tonsils and nasal cavity  <cit> . it is transmitted via the respiratory route by breaching the mucosal epithelium and then enters the blood vessels  <cit> . the capsule of s. suis  <dig> and suilysin secreted by s. suis  <dig> may help the bacterium to evade macrophage phagocytosis and innate immune responses  <cit> . in a previous study, s. suis  <dig> was shown to interact with alveolar macrophages and induce the nf-kb and map-kinase signaling pathways. in this study, we evaluated the differential expression of genes in the lung in response to s. suis  <dig> infection. according to our results, a group of cytokines showed maximal up-regulation in the lung after infection with s. suis  <dig>  of these, il1b, il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il <dig> were up-regulated only in lung, il12b and tnf-a were more highly expressed in both lung and pbmc, and il10rb in all three tissues. in addition, il1a was up-regulated in pbmc while il <dig> was up-regulated in brain but not in lung. these data are in agreement with other studies that suggest that s. suis  <dig> can stimulate porcine monocytes or macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines, and thus contribute to the pneumonia caused by s. suis  <dig> infection. in addition, we have shown that mhc molecules and adhesion molecules are critical in allowing s. suis  <dig> to break through epithelial cell barriers to cause pneumonia, although many of the de genes involved are little known in s. suis  <dig> infection.

CONCLUSIONS
global transcription studies have been performed to analyze the pathogenesis of many diseases. in this study, we profiled the response of pbmc, brain and lung tissues to infection with s. suis  <dig> strain sc <dig> using the affymetrix porcine genome array. a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts were identified in the three tissues, including  <dig> unique genes in brain,  <dig> in lung,  <dig> in pbmc and  <dig> in all three tissues. these de genes involve in the immune response included genes related to the inflammatory response, innate immune response, cell adhesion, antigen processing and presentation, cytokines and angiogenesis. in addition, a number of de genes identified in our study are still function unknown, providing information for future investigations. taken together, the transcriptome analysis of s. suis 2-infected tissues will increase our knowledge of the pathogenesis of meningitis, septicemia and pneumonia in pigs caused by s. suis  <dig>
