BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have linked more than ten thousand of single nucleotide polymorphisms  to human diseases and traits  <cit> . given that a great part of associated variants are located in known tissue-specific enhancers, a recent study by tehranchi and colleagues  <cit>  found that these non-coding variants affect transcription factors  binding and gene expression. although they found that ccctc-binding factor  is likely to play a pioneering role in translating natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture  <cit> , we still strive to understand tumor-specific epigenetic features that render possible progression toward such disease. for instance, previous approaches have been adopted to explore disease risk association with regulatory dna elements .

in prostate cancer  the androgen receptor  binds predominantly to gene-distal sites and has been used by multiple groups to functionally annotate genetic risk loci based on overlaps with risk single nucleotide polymorphisms  as measured in genome-wide association studies , which in some cases are also predicted to affect ar binding  <cit> .

epigenetic marks such as acetylation on histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  have been used as annotation of enhancers  <cit> . moreover, regions of extended h3k27ac bound by combinations of mediator complex subunit  <dig>  and bromodomain containing protein  <dig>  have been defined as super-enhancers important to determine cell identity . brd <dig> has proven to be involved in several diseases thanks to the small molecule inhibitor jq <dig>  <cit> . in pc cells, brd <dig> was recently shown to bind to the ar and affect its activity  <cit>  while components of the mediator complex such as med <dig> and med <dig> were recently found to be implicated in advanced pc  <cit> .

snps associated with common diseases have been found to lie within enhancers driving transcriptional output and have been identified using different methods  <cit> . for pc, the most recent methods include genotyping matched to expression quantitative trait loci analysis and epigenetic marks such as h3k27ac combined with chromatin accessibility  <cit>  or additional combination of binding information for key tfs such as ar and foxa <dig>  <cit> . here we combined information on h3k27ac profile with binding site data for brd <dig> and med <dig> to improve the functional annotation of pc risk snps based on a previously described enrichment analysis  <cit> .

we show that this method is able to capture snps associated not only with pc but also in the context of breast cancer  and lung cancer  susceptibility. we find that brd <dig> is the key discriminant of tissue-specific super-enhancers and binds disease specific pc and bc low p-value risk snps. enrichment of disease-specific risk snps is higher when brd <dig> binding profile information is incorporated with other epigenetic marks such as h3k27ac and med components, than for binding profiles of key tfs implicated in disease development and progression such as the ar or estrogen receptor . inhibitors for brd <dig> are in clinical trials. however, little is known about the contribution of brd <dig> to brain diseases. in order to evaluate if similar principles apply also for heritable mental disorders we extended our framework to epigenetic marks including brd <dig> binding derived from schwann cells and applied the enrichment analysis to gwas studies of mental disorders from the psychiatric genetics consortium   <cit> .

methods
data source for enhancers’ annotation
ar binding information in both lncap and vcap cells was retrieved from massie et al.,   <cit> . raw data were aligned with novoalign to human genome version hg <dig>  and peaks were called with macs using default parameters after filtering low quality reads . resulting peaks were then overlapped using bedtools. med <dig> binding information and h3k27ac profile in lncap cells was retrieved from wang et al.,   <cit>  and re-analyzed as described above. to define the degree of overlap with super-enhancers, we also downloaded super-enhancers coordinates from dbsuper database  <cit> . brd <dig> binding information and h3k27ac profile in vcap cells was retrieved from asangani et al.,   <cit> . er and brd <dig> binding information were retrieved from nagarajan et al.,   <cit> . h3k27ac profile in mcf <dig> was retrieved from theodorou et al.,   <cit> . brd <dig> and med <dig> binding information, and h3k27ac profile for small cell lung cancer  cell line h <dig> and schwann cells were retrieved from cistrome  <cit> . all cell-specific datasets were equally analyzed to ensure comparability within a tissue type.

enhancers were defined in lncap based on  extended h3k27ac marked regions ranging from 3000 bp to 200 kb ;  an intersection of these h3k27ac marked regions with med <dig> binding sites . in vcap cells enhancers were defined  as an extended h3k27ac marked regions ranging from 3000 bp to 200 kb   the intersection of h3k27ac stretches longer than 2000 bp and brd <dig> binding sites   or  as brd <dig> sites alone .  to achieve a consensus map of super-enhancers in pc  we selected super-enhancers found in lncap cells that were found to have h3k27ac and brd <dig> binding also in vcap cells.

enhancers in mcf <dig> cells were identified following the criteria described in hnisz et al.,   <cit> . first, h3k27ac peaks closer than 100 bp were merged, then only stretches longer than 2000 bp were selected . different compendia of enhancers were then created based on the presence of brd <dig>  and er binding  or the combination of these features . the same type of algorithm was followed to identify enhancers in h <dig> and schwann cells 90-8tl . dnase i hypersensitive sites  profiles for lncap cells were retrieved from he et al.   <cit>  and from encode . a more stringent profile of these two based on overlap  was also included.

data source for summary statistics of genome-wide association studies
we obtained summary statistics from large meta-analyses of the traits of interest. in particular, the summary statistics for association with pc risk were obtained from the illumina array collaborative oncological gene-environment study  consortium  <cit>  and comprised information on  <dig>  cases and  <dig>  controls genotyped on a customized array including  <dig>  snps. additionally, we used summary statistics on  <dig>  snps for association with pc risk derived from a smaller uk-based cohort including  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls in collaboration with the practical consortium  <cit> . genetic association with bc risk was obtained in collaboration with the bcac consortium and was derived from a meta-analysis including  <dig>  cases and  <dig>  controls on ~ <dig>  million snps  <cit> . we collected also summary statistics for  <dig>  cases of lung cancer  and  <dig>  controls including  <dig> , <dig> snps from the tricl consortium  <cit> . from the igap consortium we obtained summary data from  <dig>  alzheimer's disease cases and  <dig>  controls genotyped on  <dig>  snps  <cit> . finally from the pgc consortium we used summary statistics on association with schizophrenia on  <dig>  cases and  <dig>  controls including  <dig> , <dig> snps  <cit> , and summary statistics on association with bipolar disorder on  <dig>  cases and  <dig>  controls on a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps  <cit> .

snps enrichment method
enrichment is defined by the presence of lower p-values than expected by chance. quantile-quantile  plots are tools commonly used in genetics to visualize enrichment  <cit> . typically, the observed p-value quantiles on the y-axes are plotted against the theoretical p-value quantiles under the assumption of no association  on the x-axes. in case of no association, a q-q plot follows a straight 0– <dig> line starting from the origin. in the presence of association, the enrichment  is described by the deflection of the q-q plot from this theoretical line of no association. we used stratified q-q plots to assess differential enrichment of snps mapping to specific categories of enhancers. stratified q-q plots have been used previously to demonstrate enrichment of general location annotation categories such as 5’utr snps  <cit> .

quantifying snps enrichment within sets of enhancers
to assess the significance of the association enrichment among the sets of snps within enhancers we used fisher’s hypergeometric test. more specifically, we tested for over-representation of genome-wide significant snps  within specific enhancers. we adjusted for multiple testing using a bonferroni-correction accounting for the number of annotations tested.

random pruning
the statistical models underlying the snp enrichment analyses carried out here generally assume independence of the data. far from resembling independent samples, snps are linked by complex correlation patterns reflected in their linkage disequilibrium  structure. in order to adhere more closely to the independence assumption, and to rule out bias due to confounding factors such as ld, and assess whether the intrinsic capacity of functional annotations to enrich specific snp sets was due to such confounding factors, the snps were randomly pruned prior to the analyses by randomly selecting representatives from all 1mbase ld blocks of snps with pairwise r
2 ≥  <dig> . iterating the random pruning procedure  <dig> times and subsequently averaging the corresponding test statistics compensated the arbitrariness in the choice of representative snps. these analyses were performed and shown in additional file 22: figures s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> 

RESULTS
to assess whether tissue or cell-specific enhancers could mark tissue-specific risk snps associated with development of pc, we analyzed datasets from two studies that profiled med <dig> binding and h3k27ac map in lncap cells  <cit> , and brd <dig> and h3k27ac in vcap cells  <cit> . med <dig>  is a subunit of the same chromatin looping mediator complex as med <dig>  <cit>  therefore we used it for our pc study assuming that these two subunits would have similar binding profiles in the same cells.

enhancers were defined in lncap based on  extended h3k27ac marked regions ;  an intersection of these h3k27ac marked regions with med <dig> binding sites . in vcap cells enhancers were defined as  extended h3k27ac marked regions   the intersection of h3k27ac stretches and brd <dig> binding sites  or  as brd <dig> sites alone .  to achieve a consensus map of enhancers in pc  we intersected the enhancers found in both lncap and vcap cells characterized by all three epigenetic features and responded to the definition of super-enhancers  <cit>  .table  <dig> snps mapping to epigenetic marks used to define enhancers in prostate and breast cancer

enrichment of snps associated with prostate cancer in regions bound by med and brd <dig>  marked by h3k27ac in prostate cancer cells
first, we overlaid genome coordinates of enhancers in pc cell lines, as defined previously, with genomic coordinates of all snps in the pc icogs dataset  <cit> . to visualize differential enrichment patterns of specific epigenetic markers with respect to their genetic association with pc risk we generated stratified q-q plots which is a method for visualizing the enrichment of statistical association relative to that expected under the global null hypothesis  <cit> . q-q plots show that snps within regions with different genomic features  had different enrichment patterns compared to all snps . the snps contained in common pc enhancers, and therefore characterized by brd <dig> and med <dig> binding, and a long stretch of h3k27ac had lower p-values than snps contained in enhancers identified in vcap cells by mapping long stretches of h3k27ac and brd <dig> binding. snps associated with pc risk were more enriched within brd <dig> binding sites alone than within h3k27ac sites or h3k27ac/med <dig> overlapping sites in lncap. in addition, we focused on snps achieving genome wide significance and compared overrepresentation of these snps mapping to the above-described enhancers . 12% and 3% of the snps contained in pc enhancers achieved genome-wide significance in the icogs and in the practical gwas respectively. snps that achieved significance in icogs are listed in additional file 22: table s <dig>  these results highlight that combining generic epigenetic marks such as h3k27ac with generic epigenetic readers such as brd <dig> and with med binding increases the capacity of capturing snps associated with pc.fig.  <dig> enrichment of snps lying within enhancers. q-q plots visualizing the p-value enrichment of sets of snps mapping within genomic intervals identified as regions of putative enhancers or key transcription factor binding sites. the p-values describe the association of a specific snp with prostate  and breast cancer . the genomic intervals represent regions bound by med <dig>  brd <dig> with a h3k27ac modification in prostate cancer cell lines , or in overlapping regions profiled for a combination of the features in the prostate cancer  cell-lines as indicated , intersected with ar binding sites , or regions found in mcf <dig> , as indicated in the legends.  q-q plots visualizing the p-value enrichment of schizophrenia associated snps  lying within enhancers identified in schwann cells




importantly, to rule out possible confounding factors, we first randomly pruned the snps, selecting one representative snp per ld block. the random pruning did not change the enrichments patterns caused by the functional annotations . secondly, in order to rule out that the enrichment merely results from the non-independence of the snps in the enhancer regions or other confounding features of these, we compared the observed enrichment to the one attained on a set of snps numerically matching those in the enhancer regions on minor allele frequencies and mutual ld r
 <dig> . the numerically matched snp set was also used as control set to assess the enrichment significance  by means of fisher’s hypergeometric test .

enrichment of prostate cancer associated snps within androgen receptor binding information.
we also compared the genomic coordinates of the snps to the coordinates for ar binding sites . despite the use in the literature of arbss for functional annotation of gwas significant pc snps, intersecting enhancer information with ar binding data did not lead to any further enrichment of snps associated with pc compared with enhancer information alone . in particular, although intersecting ar binding information induced a slight left-shift of the q-q plot for enhancers marked by h3k27ac, med <dig>  and brd <dig> binding, and for enhancers marked by h3k27ac and brd <dig>  the enrichment was caused by the same snps responsible for the enrichment without ar binding information . furthermore, enhancer information outperformed arbss profile alone, or in combination with h3k27ac profile, in enriching for genome-wide significant p-valued snps in pc , and overlapping ar with brd <dig> binding sites did not alter the superior capability of brd <dig>  to enrich for disease associated snps. interestingly, although dhss have been used to predict locations of common disease-associated variation  <cit> , dhss profiles enriched less than arbss alone .

validation of the enrichment method on an independent gwas for prostate cancer.
finally, we validated our results on the independent pc gwas obtained from the practical consortium measured on a smaller uk-based cohort  <cit>  . again, we observed the strongest snp enrichment in pc super-enhancers marked by h3k27ac, med <dig>  and brd <dig> binding.

brd <dig> binding sites derived from prostate cancer cells do not enrich for snps associated with breast cancer
to test the specificity of brd <dig>  med <dig> and h3k27ac profiles in pc cells in identifying tissue-specific snps, we performed a similar enrichment analysis for genetic association with bc risk measured on the genotype array content from the bcac  <cit>  . enhancers defined on the basis of brd <dig> binding profile in pc cells failed to enrich specifically for bc associated snps. whilst h3k27ac and med <dig> together achieved some enrichment of bc snps, the addition of brd <dig> depleted this enrichment entirely. importantly, once again, randomly pruning the snps did not alter the results of the enrichment analysis . these results are in stark contrast to the analysis on pc datasets in which inclusion of brd <dig> enhanced enrichment of low p-valued snps associated with pc, and suggests a hierarchical determination of tissue-specificity, based on the subsequential deposition of these epigenetic marks. taken together, this indicates that brd <dig> substantially contributes to prostate-specific snp enrichment within super-enhancers.

of note, the genomic distribution of the bcac snp array mirrored the genomic distribution of the snp arrays used for icogs with the majority of snps located within intronic  and intergenic  regions of the genome  thus meaning that whilst the number of snps differed between the pc and bc studies, there was no genomic distribution bias for imputed snps. the snps included within the enhancers defined in this study reflected similar distributions, with the only exception of snps lists derived from lncap cells that were slightly biased toward intergenic regions. around 69% to 77% of the snps were located within intergenic regions .

enrichment of snps associated with breast cancer in regions bound by brd <dig>  marked by h3k27ac in breast cancer cells
next, we sought to identify whether using bc-specific epigenetic profiles for the same markers derived from the bc cell line mcf <dig>  we would be able to repeat the same performance as in the pc enrichment analysis. therefore we retrieved genome-wide profiles of h3k27ac, er, and brd <dig> binding in mcf <dig>  <cit> , compiled a similar list of enhancers , and performed an enrichment analysis of association with bc risk on the bcac gwas . information on med binding is not available for bc cell lines. however, brd <dig> binding information alone caused the strongest enrichment of snps associated with bc . these data confirm that brd <dig> alone is an important enhancer and super-enhancer discriminant, which binds disease-specific susceptibility loci in a tissue specific fashion. randomly pruning the snps involved, proved not to alter the capacity of brd <dig> of capturing disease-specific associated snps . interestingly, pruning the snps revealed that er capability to capture disease associated snps in combination with other epigenetic features was enhanced, possibly suggesting a different contribution of er and ar in breast and pc pathogenesis, respectively.

as counterproof, we tested whether bc epigenetic profiles caused any enrichment in icogs pc associations, but no such enrichment was detected . these results are consistent with brd <dig> binding being cell and tissue-specific  <cit> . moreover, these results pinpoint the tissue-specificity of risk loci and hint that brd <dig> activity may be influenced by genetic variations as it is for tfs  <cit> .

enrichment of risk snps associated with lung cancer and psychiatric traits using h3k27ac profiles, brd <dig>  and med binding sites derived from relevant cell lines
to understand whether the properties of brd <dig> binding to clinically relevant genetic risk loci is confined to pc and bc only, or such selectivity can also be observed to other diseases and traits, we retrieved binding information for brd <dig>  med <dig> and h3k27ac profiles available for the lynphoblastoid cell line h <dig> derived from a metastatic site in a lc patient  <cit>  and from the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor schwann cells 90-8tl  <cit>  . to retrieve associations of these epigenetic features with other phenotypes we collected summary statistics for lc  <cit> , alzheimer’s disease  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit> , and bipolar disorder  <cit> .

brd <dig> binding information alone caused the strongest enrichment of associations with lc, although combined information for brd <dig> and med <dig> binding, also combined with h3k27ac profile failed to improve the enrichment of low p-value snps . we speculate that the lc cell line h <dig> might not reflect characteristics of the tissue of origin, as well as the pc and bc cell lines. however, upon assessing the enrichment using epigenetic features related to pc cells for the same lc gwas , as expected, we detected none, confirming that brd <dig> binding information in h <dig> retains some tissue-specificity and capacity to enrich for lc tissue-specific risk snps.

next, we applied our enrichment method to perform an inverse analysis in which we sought to understand whether any association could be found between epigenetic features related to schwann cells  and three diseases affecting the brain. no enrichment for snps associated with alzheimer disease and bipolar disorder was detected . however, low p-valued snps associated with schizophrenia were highly enriched within brd <dig> binding sites . interestingly h3k27ac profiles also enriched substantially for clinically relevant snps associated with schizophrenia. these data suggest that brd <dig> activity in schwann cells could potentially be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia  <cit> , and grant further investigation on the molecular mechanism underlying these findings.

discussion
with the discovery of significant numbers of cancer genetic risk loci through gwas there is now a major focus on the functional annotation of these loci to prioritize them for further biological study. so far this annotation has been undertaken post-gwas and has often employed classifiers of open chromatin, for example dhs, as a primary annotation followed by genome-wide binding maps for tissue-specific transcription factors such as the ar for pc or the er for bc, while combining this information with h3k27ac and open chromatin in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> . in this study we ask whether it is possible to use binding sites data and chromatin marks upfront to enrich for genetic risk factors in a cancer type-specific manner. we show that an enhancer signature comprising a number of factors but dominated by brd <dig> allows for the enrichment of pc-specific and bc-specific genetic risk loci . interestingly, these chromatin features have been previously reported to be characteristic of super-enhancer-like profiles . we found a strong degree of tissue-specificity, that is when profiles are derived from cell-lines associated with specific cancer types such as the cancer of the breast and prostate, they become far more effective at enriching for cancer-type specific risk loci than other widely used cancer type-specific tfs such as the ar, er or dhss alone. we also applied this enrichment strategy to infer that brd <dig> binding information may allow in future for the upfront nomination of genomic-regions for high-coverage sequencing in risk studies for schizophrenia . functional determination of the impact of risk snps have been the priority of several consortia aiming to uncover the effects on epigenetics mediated by clinically relevant risk variants located in non-exonic regions  <cit> . our study implies a conserved and important relationship between enhancers and cancer-associated risk loci, which is being pinpointed also by recent work linking the effect of genetic variation to tfs binding  <cit> . our approach is the first one that implies an effect of such genetic variations on the activity of generic epigenetic readers. this is also the first time that such epigenetic readers have been evaluated as enrichment factors for snps without prior filtering based on published p-values for risk association.fig.  <dig> circular plots of gwas significant snps overlapping with putative super-enhancers. the outmost circles depict chromosome-wise histograms showing p-values of snp loci  representatives for snps in icogs , for snps in bcac , and for snps associated with schizophrenia according to pgc . gwas-significant snps are labeled and the nearby genes are also indicated. the inmost circle represents super-enhancers regions identified in prostate cancer cells  , breast cancer cells  , and in schwann cells   that were most enriched of low p-value snps




we highlight the possibility that snps lying within super-enhancers marked by brd <dig> are more likely to be associated with an increased susceptibility to bc, pc, and schizophrenia. the expression of the genes regulated by enhancers identified in these diseases could be altered by the presence of specific snps lying therein . this is a concept that has recently been postulated for cancer mutations occurring in a chromatin-specific context  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we have discovered that brd4-bound super-enhancers provide a powerful tool for enriching and prioritizing pc and bc genetic risk loci , and have shown that key tfs such as ar or er, despite being pivotal tissue-specific tfs, do not contribute to tissue-specific genetic risk enrichment more than epigenetic factors. we propose to refine disease specific risk loci enrichment with the identification of potential binding of brd <dig> combined with key med components and acetylation profiles. our study will promote the use of brd <dig> for snp annotation as the genetic landscape for different diseases goes on expanding.fig.  <dig> tissue-specific super-enhancers usage and identification of clinically relevant genetic variations associated with diseases and traits. the method for prioritization of clinically relevant snps is based on the identification of risk snps with gwas significance that are associated with brd <dig> binding to chromatin, within tissue-specific super-enhancers rather transcription factors binding
