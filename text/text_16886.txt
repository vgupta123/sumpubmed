BACKGROUND
mirnas are small noncoding rnas that regulate gene expression by base pairing to mrnas. targeting occurs by complementarity between the seed region  of the mirna and the mrna 3’ utr  <cit> , and results in transcript silencing by translational repression and mrna destabilization . this minimal degree of base pairing enables a single mirna to target multiple  transcripts  <cit>  thereby complicating the identification of relevant mirna targets for a given biological outcome. on the other hand, a single gene is typically under the control of several different mirnas. consequently, mirna networks appear highly distributed, with each individual mirna having a widespread but modest effect on gene expression.

mirnas are abundant in the brain and have been implicated in various aspects of cns development, from renewal of neural stem cells, to differentiation, neurite projection, dendrite maturation and synaptic plasticity  <cit> . the impact of mirnas on neurodevelopment in both vertebrates and invertebrates is now supported by a large body of work , and provides a plausible explanation for the increasing number of mirnas associated with neurodevelopmental disorders  <cit> . recent studies also point to a role of mirnas at the synapse, particularly on the post-synaptic side. specific mirnas control dendrite complexity  <cit> , dendritic excitability  <cit>  and spine shape , while others target glutamate receptors  <cit>  and post-synaptic scaffolds  <cit> , or regulate long-term potentiation  and depression   <cit> , persistent forms of synaptic plasticity that are thought to rely predominantly on post-synaptic mechanisms.

comparatively less is known about the effect of mirnas on presynaptic functions and neurotransmitter release. this is somewhat surprising, given that proper dosage of neurotransmitter release is of central importance for neural circuit performance and is fine-tuned by complex gene regulatory networks  <cit> . in support, however, of a role of mirnas in this process, a recent bioinformatics study shows that presynaptic transcripts have an unusually long 3’utr with an increased number of predicted mirna target sites  <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> and the mir- <dig> cluster target presynaptic components and regulate neurotransmitter release in flies  <cit> .

we have previously identified mir-27b in a targeted screen for mirnas that regulate presynaptic assembly in rodent cortical neurons  <cit> . mir-27b is highly-expressed in the brain  <cit>  and has been associated with bipolar disorders and schizophrenia  <cit> . here, we explore the impact of mir-27b on ~ <dig> transcripts that make up the presynaptic compartment in excitatory neurons. we find, unexpectedly, that mir-27b up-regulates the expression of more than half of these presynaptic transcripts. this enhancing effect is due to mir-27b-dependent down-regulation of three main transcriptional repressors—bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp90—that operate in concert to silence the presynaptic transcriptome. our results further indicate that mir-27b-dependent silencing of bmi <dig> shapes neural activity in cortical networks and suggest that posttranscriptional repression of bmi <dig> is required for the developmental transition of a neural stem cell into a mature, synaptically-competent neuron.

RESULTS
mir-27b boosts expression of presynaptic genes
to explore the global impact of mir-27b on genes associated with presynaptic function, we first compiled a list of  <dig> “presynaptic” genes, based on previous proteomics and functional studies . these genes encode for the vast majority of proteins that make up the presynaptic compartment, and include synaptic vesicle  proteins, active zone proteins, channels, adhesion molecules, trafficking and signaling proteins . we have also included in that list a handful of neuronally expressed and validated mir-27b and dicer <dig> targets, many of which regulate gene expression . to knock down mir-27b in cortical neurons, we targeted mir-27b-3p—the guide strand of the mir-27b duplex and one of the most abundant mirnas loaded onto the rna-induced silencing complex  in the brain  <cit> —using a shrna  cloned into a gfp-expressing lentiviral vector. transduction of cortical neurons with mirzip-27b led to a specific and substantial reduction of mir-27b-3p levels  whereas a scrambled shrna sequence  had no effect . because mammalian mirnas silence gene expression predominantly by promoting message destruction  <cit> , we profiled the mrnas of these ~ <dig> genes both in mir-27b knockdown  and control  neurons. as mirnas typically have mild effects on the expression of most genes, we used a profiling approach  that offers high levels of precision and sensitivity  <cit>  and which is based on color-coded, gene-specific barcodes and multiplex single-molecule imaging of individual transcripts.fig.  <dig> mir-27b kd globally alters expression of the presynaptic transcriptome. a ontology-based classification of  <dig> presynaptic genes targeted by ncounter probes. ncounter probes were also designed against a few validated mir-27b and dicer <dig> targets. b mirzip-27b  suppressed mir-27b, but not mir-181a in div <dig> mouse cortical neurons . mirna levels were measured by qpcr. c ncounter profiling of the presynaptic transcriptome in mir-27b kd and ct neurons . genes were ranked based on their differential expression. only genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated  are shown . the pie chart indicates the number of genes up- and down-regulated, unchanged, or with low counts . d,e top  <dig> most down- and up-regulated genes. f mir-27b and mir-181a levels probed by qpcr in dicer1

analysis of differential gene expression showed that mir-27b significantly regulates  <dig> genes, which amounts to 76 % of the presynaptic transcriptome after the exclusion of  <dig> genes with low counts . to our surprise, 70 % of the affected genes were down-regulated implying a positive influence of mir-27b on gene expression. to determine whether this type of regulation is unique to mir-27b, we profiled these transcripts in cortical neurons derived from a mouse homozygous for the floxed dicer <dig> allele  and transduced with the cre recombinase . we reasoned that if most mirnas repress presynaptic genes, we should see an overall increase in gene expression in cells devoid of mirnas. transduction of cre in dicer1
fl/fl neurons led to marked reduction of mir-27b and mir-181a, consistent with efficient cre-mediated excision of the dicer <dig> gene . among the  <dig> genes that are differentially regulated in dicer <dig> cko neurons,  <dig>  were up-regulated, in agreement with a global negative impact of mirnas on gene expression . thus, in contrast to the bulk of mirnas, mir-27b exerts a positive influence on the presynaptic transcriptome.

the transcriptional regulators bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp <dig> are direct targets of mir-27b
we hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of mir-27b on gene expression is indirect and is mediated by mir-27b-dependent silencing of transcriptional repressors or mrna-destabilizing genes. to systematically search for putative mir-27b targets, we first analyzed the impact of mir-27b on gene expression at the genome-wide level using a microarray approach. differential gene expression analysis revealed a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were up- and down-regulated, respectively . comparative analysis of the presynaptic transcriptome in the ncounter and microarray datasets reveals a 50 % overlap among the top  <dig> most differentially-expressed genes . preferential down-regulation of presynaptic genes in mir-27b kd neurons is also observed in the microarray dataset , but disappears at the genome-wide level , suggesting the stimulating activity of mir-27b only applies to a targeted subset of genes.fig.  <dig> sox <dig>  zfp <dig> and bmi <dig> are mir-27b targets. a,b genome-wide transcriptome analysis of mir-27b kd and ct mouse cortical neurons . a hierarchical clustering of differentially-expressed genes with fold-change ≥  <dig>  . columns represent individual experiments . rows correspond to individual genes. . b top  <dig> most up-regulated genes in mir-27b kd neurons . dark grey bars refer to candidate repressor genes. c qpcr analysis of trib <dig>  and candidate repressors in mir-27b kd vs ct neurons . results are expressed as the kd/ct ratio. d luciferase reporters containing the 3’utr of candidate repressors ) were electroporated in neurons later transduced with mirzip-27b and mirzip-scr lentiviruses. luciferase activities were normalized to ct values . . e qpcr analysis of bmi <dig> expression in neurons  transduced with a control vector or a bmi1-expressing construct . f rnai kd of sox <dig> and zfp <dig> in cortical neurons assessed by qpcr . g ncounter profiling of the presynaptic transcriptome in ct and bmi <dig> oe cortical neurons .  <dig> genes are differentially regulated. h,i ncounter analysis of the presynaptic transcriptome in sox11- and zfp90-silenced cortical neurons .  <dig> and  <dig> genes are differentially-expressed respectively. error bars are sd except for c-e where they represent sem. j,k combinatorial intersection analysis of differentially-expressed genes in mir-27b kd, bmi <dig> oe, sox11- and zfp <dig> kd neurons. j intersections among genes repressed by bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp <dig> and activated by mir-27b. k intersections among genes repressed by mir-27b and activated by bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp90




next, we searched for candidate genes based on the extent of their up-regulation in mir-27b kd neurons, the presence of predicted mir-27b-binding sites in their 3’-utr, and their reported function as transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulators. three genes, mex3a, sox <dig> and zfp <dig> were selected based on these criteria . we added to that list bmi <dig>  the 4th most upregulated gene in the ncounter dataset  and a validated mir-27b target  <cit> . we confirmed by qpcr that all four genes are upregulated in mir-27b kd neurons , and tested the ability of mir-27b to downregulate luciferase reporters containing the 3’-utrs of these putative repressors. reporters with the 3’-utrs of bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp <dig>  are up-regulated in mir-27b kd neurons , indicating that these three genes are likely targets of mir-27b.

mir-27b turns on the presynaptic transcriptome by silencing bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp90
bmi <dig> is a polycomb group protein that functions as an epigenetic repressor  <cit>  and maintains self-renewal of neural stem cells  <cit> . sox <dig> is a member of the soxc family of transcription factors that regulates neurogenesis in both the central and peripheral nervous system . de novo sox <dig> mutations cause coffin-siris syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by microcephaly and intellectual disability  <cit> . less is known about the zinc-finger protein zfp <dig>  this transcription factor regulates the transcriptional repressor rest  <cit>  and is located in a 16q <dig>  microdeletion in a family with mental retardation  <cit> .

to determine which, if any, of these three transcriptional regulators mediate mir-27b’s effect on the presynaptic transcriptome, we profiled presynaptic transcripts in neurons with altered levels of bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp <dig>  each of these three transcriptional regulators functioned, globally, as a repressor . overexpression of bmi <dig>  resulted in repression of  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which  overlapped with mir-27b up-regulated genes . only a dozen genes were upregulated by bmi <dig>  with little intersection  with mir-27b repressed genes . the striking similarity between bmi1-repressed and mir-27b up-regulated genes suggests that bmi <dig> is a major functional target of mir-27b.

because we were unable to overexpress sox <dig> and zfp <dig> at sufficient levels , we silenced them, instead, by lentiviral delivery of shrnas. this approach resulted in a moderate  reduction of sox <dig> and zfp <dig> transcripts . fewer presynaptic genes are significantly regulated by sox <dig> or zfp <dig> , which could reflect incomplete knockdown of these transcriptional regulators. among the genes repressed by sox <dig> and zfp <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  intersected, respectively, with mir-27b upregulated genes . more than 47 % of sox11- and zfp90-repressed genes were co-repressed by bmi <dig>  while sox <dig> and zfp <dig> shared 87 % of their down-regulated target genes . only a handful of genes were up-regulated by sox <dig> and zfp <dig>  with little overlap with mir-27b repressed, or bmi <dig> stimulated genes . thus, there is significant overlap in genes repressed by bmi <dig>  sox <dig> and zfp <dig> and silencing of these three transcriptional regulators by mir-27b likely has an additive effect on the expression of presynaptic genes. these data led us to infer that mir-27b shapes the presynaptic transcriptome by silencing at least three transcriptional repressors with intersecting target genes.

gene set enrichment analysis predicts roles of mir-27b in synaptic transmission and repression of a proliferative state
we were intrigued by the fact that two out of three repressors of the presynaptic transcriptome—bmi <dig> and sox11—are central regulators of neural stem cell renewal and neurogenesis. this led us to speculate that mir-27b functions as a genetic switch by suppressing proliferation and promoting synapse maturation.

to test this hypothesis further, we performed a gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  on the microarray data described earlier, to find out whether gene sets related to synaptic transmission and cell proliferation are systematically altered in mir-27b kd neurons. we first ranked all genes according to the extent of their differential expression in mir-27b kd and ct cells. we then computed normalized enrichment scores  for a collection of  <dig> curated gene sets representing canonical biological pathways, and identified gene sets that are overrepresented at both extremes of the ranked list. among the top  <dig> gene sets associated with down-regulated genes in mir-27b kd neurons,  <dig> of them  were related to neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity . at the other extreme, up-regulated genes belonged to gene sets  associated with dna synthesis and the cell cycle . to functionally visualize these enrichment results, we displayed them as a network where pathways are nodes and edges represent pathway crosstalk  <cit> . this analysis revealed two main functional gene modules related to synaptic transmission and dna synthesis . together, these data show that mir-27b reciprocally regulates gene networks associated with neurotransmission and cell proliferation.fig.  <dig> gene set enrichment analysis  identifies mir-27b-regulated gene networks associated with neurotransmission and cell proliferation. a-d gsea analysis of the microarray data. out of a total of  <dig> gene sets,  <dig> were significantly enriched at the top and  <dig> were significantly enriched at the bottom of the gene ranked list . a,c selected down- and up-regulated gene sets linked to neurotransmission  and cell proliferation . gene sets are ranked according to their normalized enrichment score . the false discovery rate  is the estimated probability that a gene set with a given nes represents a false-positive. k  and r  indicate the source of pathways. b,d enrichment score  plots for the indicated gene sets. negative and positive es values point to gene sets over-represented in the top most down- or up-regulated genes in mir-27b kd neurons. vertical bars refer to individual genes in a gene set and their position reflects the contribution of each gene to the es. genes that belong to the leading edge subset  and at or before the es maximum ) contribute to the enrichment signal. e network analysis of gene sets. shown are the two largest networks of down-regulated  and up-regulated  gene sets. they are comprised of gene sets listed in  and  . node size is proportional to the number of genes in the microarray that are represented in the gene set. color intensity of the node  indicates the significance of the gene set. edge size corresponds to the number of genes that overlap between two connected gene sets. f,g hierarchical clustering of differentially-expressed genes belonging to the leading edge subset of the indicated gene sets. rows indicate individual mir-27b ct and kd conditions. f genes with clear roles in pre- or post-synaptic functions are indicated




to identify mir-27b-regulated genes potentially involved in neurotransmission, we extracted core members of the transmission-across-chemical-synapse gene set  that contribute to the enrichment score. hierarchical clustering of these genes shows, as expected, that they are significantly down-regulated in mir-27b kd neurons . many of these genes have clear presynaptic functions and five of them, gad <dig> , syt <dig> , slc17a <dig> , slc32a <dig>  and syn <dig>  belong to the top  <dig> most down-regulated genes in the ncounter dataset . of interest, these genes include regulators of both glutamate and gaba metabolism and transport, pointing to a role of mir-27b in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. a similar number of genes encode for postsynaptic proteins , including ampa-receptor , nmda-receptor  and kainate-receptor  subunits, suggesting both pre- and post-synaptic functions for mir-27b. moreover, the positive impact of mir-27b on the expression of  <dig> potassium channels , most of which are voltage-gated, hints at a broader role of mir-27b in neuronal excitability.

mir-27b stimulates neural network activity by repressing bmi1
these gsea results prompted us to examine the effect of mir-27b on synaptic transmission. we first measured miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents  in mir-27b kd and ct neurons by whole-cell patch clamp recordings. mepscs are driven by spontaneous release of glutamate from excitatory inputs, in the absence of action potential  firing. the frequency of mepscs, but not their amplitude, was markedly decreased in mir-27b kd neurons . while mepsc amplitude is governed by the number and/or activity of ampars on the post-synaptic membrane, mepsc frequency depends on the probability of neurotransmitter release and the number of excitatory inputs on the recorded neuron. to find out whether mir-27b regulates the formation of excitatory synapses, we immunostained vglut <dig>  a marker of excitatory synaptic vesicles, in mir-27b kd and ct neurons. because mir-27b also boosts expression of genes linked to gaba neurotransmission  we also labeled the sv-resident gaba transporter vgat in these cells. as anticipated, both sv markers label distinct populations of boutons and excitatory synapses far exceed inhibitory synapses in these neuron cultures . a quantitative analysis of these puncta shows a marked reduction  in both glutamatergic and gabaergic terminals . surprisingly, however, the average intensity of vglut <dig> and vgat puncta is unaffected by mir-27b knockdown, despite significant downregulation of vglut and vgat transcripts in mir-27b kd neurons , suggesting that mir-27b preferentially regulates the number of synapses rather than the abundance of these sv markers at synaptic terminals. the stimulatory effect of mir-27b on synaptogenesis was further confirmed using the active zone scaffold bassoon as a presynaptic marker . therefore, reduced number of excitatory synaptic inputs likely contributes to decrease in mepsc frequency in mir-27b kd neurons.fig.  <dig> mir-27b enhances neurotransmission. a-c whole-cell patch clamp recordings of mepscs in mir-27b kd and ct hippocampal neurons . a representative examples of individual mepsc traces for both conditions. b quantification of mepsc frequency and amplitude in mir-27b ct  and kd . * p <  <dig> , t-test. red bars indicate the mean and error bars represent sem. each symbol corresponds to data from a single neuron. c cumulative distributions of mepsc frequency and amplitude. d-f immunostaining of vglut <dig> and vgat in mir-27b kd and ct neurons. scale bar: 10um. e,f quantification of puncta density and intensity for  vglut <dig>  and  vgat  from  <dig> experiments. *p <  <dig> , t-test. g-i mea recordings of mir-27b ct and kd cortical neurons , or mir-27b kd neurons transduced with a bmi1-targeting shrna. g bright-field  and mcherry fluorescence  images of a neuron network grown on an mea chip. mcherry reports expression of mirzip-27b. scale bar: 200um. h quantification of burst frequency for the indicated conditions. each symbol represents bursting activity of a single mea culture dish. mea dishes originate from three independent experiments. red bars indicate the mean . i qpcr detection of bmi <dig> transcripts in cortical neurons expressing mirzip-scr, bmi1-shrna, mirzip-27b and mirzip-27b + bmi1-shrna . error bars represent sem




to evaluate the impact of mir-27b on neuronal excitability and ap firing, we measured spontaneous network activity in mir-27b kd and ct cortical neuron cultures using multi-electrode arrays . after 2 weeks in vitro, these neuronal networks exhibit spontaneous activity consisting of single spikes and bursts that can be recorded in real-time and non-invasively on an mea chip . control cultures display an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  sem bursts in 5 min . average burst frequency was markedly reduced, however, in mir-27b kd neurons . to determine whether mir-27b boosts network activity by repressing bmi <dig>  we co-silenced mir-27b and bmi <dig> by transducing neurons with both mirzip-27b and a bmi1-targeting shrna, in an attempt to restore network activity. we verified first that bmi <dig> levels are efficiently brought down in mir-27b kd neurons by knockdown of bmi <dig> . neuron cultures co-expressing mirzip-27b and a bmi <dig> shrna fire bursts at a frequency similar to control cells , providing evidence for a role of bmi <dig> in mir-27b-dependent regulation of network activity . collectively, these data show that mir-27b boosts neurotransmission by acting, at least in part, on the presynaptic compartment and suggest that de-repression of the presynaptic transcriptome by mir-27b silencing of bmi <dig> is sufficient to support efficient neurotransmission in neural networks.

discussion
previous analyses of mirna-mrna networks have suggested that mirnas function primarily as rheostats—they buffer gene expression but rarely act as master regulators  <cit> . mir-27b appears to be an exception to this rule. by silencing three transcriptional repressors that target overlapping sets of genes, mir-27b has a profound impact on the presynaptic transcriptome. more than half  of all genes that make up the presynapse are positively influenced by mir-27b. the stimulatory effect of mir-27b on presynaptic genes is greater than its silencing activity, both in terms of magnitude  and number of genes affected. this suggests the presence of an underlying amplification mechanism, which, we propose, is mediated by the cooperative repressive activity of three mir-27b targets. the high fraction of genes co-regulated by mir-27b and bmi <dig>  suggest that silencing of this epigenetic repressor significantly contributes to mir-27b-dependent up-regulation of presynaptic genes. rescue of network activity in mir-27b-silenced cortical neurons by rnai kd of bmi <dig> supports a functional role of this epigenetic repressor downstream of mir-27b. because most genes repressed by sox <dig> and zfp <dig> overlap with those targeted by bmi <dig>  there remains about 40 % of mir-27b up-regulated genes that could potentially be under the control of other repressors.

bmi <dig> is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex  <dig> , which, together with prc <dig>  is widely deployed in eukaryotic cells to implement gene silencing  <cit> . bmi <dig> drives self-renewal of neuronal stem cells in the forebrain and cerebellum by suppression of cell cycle inhibitors  <cit> . our data now show that bmi <dig> also represses a significant fraction of genes associated with presynaptic functions, suggesting a novel mode of action of this epigenetic regulator in maintaining an undifferentiated state. by promoting cell proliferation and repressing genes implicated in neurotransmission, bmi <dig> puts a two-tier break on cell differentiation. we propose that mir-27b-directed silencing of bmi <dig>  relieves this break and drives synaptic maturation of excitatory neurons. this model is supported by our gsea results, which identify neurotransmission and cell proliferation as the largest and most significant gene networks reciprocally regulated by mir-27b. in this context, it is worth mentioning the opposite effect of mir-27b on vglut <dig>  and vglut <dig>  expression—vglut <dig> is down-regulated  <dig> -fold, while vglut <dig> is the most up-regulated presynaptic gene in mir-27b kd neurons . a clear reciprocal expression of these two vesicular glutamate transporters is also observed in the microarray data set. of note, vglut <dig> and vglut <dig> mark distinct, largely non-overlapping populations of glutamatergic neurons in the cns—vglut <dig> is expressed in the neocortex , hippocampus and amygdala, while vglut <dig> is found in layer iv of the cerebral cortex, dentate gyrus, thalamus and hypothalamus  <cit> . this suggests the possibility that mir-27b promotes differentiation of specific, vglut1-positive, lineages of excitatory neurons. strikingly, vglut <dig> is also the most up-regulated gene in bmi1-overexpressing cells, indicating that its repression in cortical neurons may also occur through mir-27b-directed silencing of bmi <dig>  the stimulatory effect of mir-27b on synapse development is not, however, restricted to excitatory neurons. knockdown of mir-27b also results in downregulation of gaba specific genes and in reduced density of inhibitory synaptic terminals, suggesting wider functions of mir-27b in excitatory and inhibitory balance.

given the broad impact of mir-27b on the presynaptic transcriptome, and its influence on post-synaptic and neural excitability genes, it is unlikely that mir-27b’s effect on neuronal activity is dominated by any one gene . nevertheless, mir-27b turns on or off several key genes implicated in synaptic transmission. perhaps the most obvious candidate is the calcium sensor synaptotagmin- <dig> , an abundant integral protein targeted to svs that controls both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release  <cit> . mir-27b elevates syt <dig> expression by more than 2-fold in both the microarray and ncounter datasets. syt <dig> is ranked third among down-regulated presynaptic genes and is within the top  <dig>  % most down-regulated genes  in mir-27b kd neurons. it is also substantially repressed by bmi <dig>  because syt <dig> is required for evoked, synchronous neurotransmitter release  <cit> , it is possible that its down-regulation in mir-27b kd neurons contributes to reduced network activity. it is improbable, however, that syt <dig> plays a major role in mir-27b-dependent regulation of mepsc frequency, as syt <dig> ablation results, instead, in an increase in mepsc frequency  <cit> , attributed to a clamp-like activity of syt <dig> in resting cells. several other presynaptic genes, all up-regulated more than two-fold by mir-27b, are likely to contribute to this synaptic deficit. these include lin7a , an active zone scaffold  <cit> , slc17a <dig> , recently implicated in coordination of sv cargo endocytosis  <cit> , rims <dig>  and syn <dig> , which regulate vesicle docking at the active zone  <cit> , and snapin, a 15 kda protein that accelerates sv recycling  <cit> . collectively, both the genomics and neurophysiology data point to a global and positive influence of mir-27b on presynaptic function. it should be noted, however, that mir-27b also silences a handful  of presynaptic genes, including positive regulators of neurotransmitter release, such as liprin-α <dig>  and syntaxin-1a . thus, the impact of mir-27b on neurotransmission is complex and likely involves bidirectional regulation of multiple synaptic components.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe in this paper a post-transcriptional circuitry that enables a single mirna to exert considerable influence on the expression of functionally related genes. this network is based on mirna-directed silencing of transcriptional repressors with overlapping, ontology-related targets, and departs from current models of mirna-gene interactions, which ascribe to mirnas a widespread, but modest effect on gene expression  <cit> . this circuitry may be well suited to drive irreversible cellular responses, such as cell differentiation.
