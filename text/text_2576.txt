BACKGROUND
attention is a broad concept that has often been divided in the literature along various dimensions. one such division involves reflexive  versus sustained attention. reflexive attention refers to a stimulus-driven reorienting of the brain’s resources, often to an external object that newly appears, has a relatively salient color, or involves motion. the cued-orienting task that we used in our first study  <cit>  is an example of a reflexive task and is similar to that used by posner et al.  <cit> . stimuli flash briefly on the computer display and subjects automatically move their attention. it is generally assumed that attention has been captured reflexively if subjects were faster at responding to a target that was preceded by the presentation of a brief pre-cue at that same location. attention can be captured in this way even though the stimulus presentation is too brief to involve eye movements. on the other hand, sustained attention is measured with an effortful task designed to require vigilance over time. for example, the continuous performance test   <cit>  and the sustained attention to response task   <cit>  involve the presentation of a stream of stimuli, some of which require a response while others require that a response be withheld. examining slope in response time  over trials  on a reflexive attention task involves some elements of reflexive attention and some elements of sustaining attention to the task over time . contributions of reflexive attention to attentional deficits are often overlooked  but could be useful for a more complete understanding of disorders that have an attentional component, such as adhd, autism, anxiety, and depression by answering questions about biological contributions to attention using exogenous versus endogenous cues  <cit> . for example, one question might be whether it is the nature of the task itself  that induces declining performance over time or if non-effortful  attention tasks can induce the same decline in performance in some individuals. there are several studies that discuss genetic associations with rt changes across the course of a sustained attention task ; however, the literature contains almost no genetic-association studies on how rt changes across trials during the course of a reflexive task. such studies might be helpful in determining if declining performance over time shares similar or has distinct genetic influences in reflexive attention and sustained attention tasks. the genes we selected are related to the availability of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and dopamine . we have previously found some of these genes to be associated with mean rt difference scores  <cit> . in this paper, we extend those findings with a novel look at the influence of these genes on the slope of rt over the course of the 20-min reflexive attention task. looking at rt slope is unlike looking at moment-to-moment rt variability because the former is probably dependent on alertness or learning  <cit>  while the latter is probably related to vigilance and the ability to detect a signal beyond neural noise  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hypothetical illustration of two types of variability. the top portion shows three individuals who differ in the spread  around a regression line after slope is covaried out. the bottom portion represents variability of rt slope between individuals. some individuals become faster  over the  <dig> presentations of a given trial type. we are primarily interested in rt slope variability in this paper

bellgrove et al.  <cit>  refer to 3r but according to nn rommelse, me altink, a arias-vasquez, cj buschgens, e fliers, sv faraone, jk buitelaar, ja sergeant, b franke and j oosterlaan  <cit>  3r is now called 6r



candidate gene studies that show associations between specific genes and various attentional measures provide evidence of genetic influences on attention. such an association might occur because a given gene influences the availability of a neurotransmitter. that is, the biological pathway from gene to behavior could include neurotransmitters whose availability impacts those behaviors. for example, attention  <cit>  and memory  <cit>  are known to be influenced by the availability of the neurotransmitters. the varying availability of these neurotransmitters due to genetic differences could make behaviors like attending more or less efficient in some individuals, and this, in turn, could be captured by various measures of attention.

one component of adhd is difficulty in maintaining attentional arousal. individuals with adhd are frequently identified as having this difficulty . usually the connection between maintaining arousal and dopamine is made for moment-to-moment variability. for example, johnson et al.  <cit>  make the argument that dopamine must be involved in moment-to-moment rt variability because methylphenidate  reduces rt variability. exaggerated rt variability could arise because of difficulty in sustaining attention such that rts rise and fall over the course of a task independently of the task requirements. rt variability may increase with less dopamine availability because it becomes harder to distinguish signal from noise in the nervous system. that is, reduced availability of dopamine could lead to weaker neural signals giving random neural noise a larger impact on target detection and response  <cit> .

another form of variability over trials would be monotonic increases or decreases in rt. that is, dopamine availability could also be related to rt slope over the course of a task. for example, bioulac et al.  <cit>  found that children with adhd decline in performance over time on a continuous performance test. this finding could apply to slight attentional deficits found in nonclinical populations as well. in such populations, there may be variations in neurotransmitters that have been associated with attention generally and these variations could contribute to an increase in rt over the course of a task.

this is interesting because our previous analysis of the data in the current study showed that individuals from the general population differed on their mean rts depending on their neurotransmitter-related genotypes  <cit> . risk alleles for each genetic marker were identified in previous studies as associated with adhd, greater rt costs, and/or reduced cognitive functioning generally. each genetic marker was coded such that zero indicates neither parent contributed a risk allele for these cognitive outcomes, one indicates one parent contributed a risk allele, and two indicates that each parent contributed a risk allele. those findings that used an rt attention task generally associated genetic markers with mean rts or rt difference scores. as mentioned previously, we could find no studies in the literature on genetic associations with rt slope in reflexive attention tasks.

in the current study we asked a simple question: are rt slopes on a reflexive attention task associated with specific genes? we have genotyping information for subjects on the dopamine-related genes comt, dat <dig>  dbh and drd <dig>  we also have information on apoe, which carries risk for alzheimer’s disease, is related to acetylcholine and has been related to cued orienting, even in young adults and adolescents  and with attention generally  <cit> . it is useful to examine genes that do not fit with the dopamine hypothesis of attentional deficits and yet have a logical and historical association with attention. using these data previously on some of these genes  <cit> , we found significant mean rt differences between individuals with different genotypes. our goal was to determine if there are also genetic associations with rt slopes across trials in an reflexive task. thus, we are looking for gene-by-trial interactions by modeling logarithm transformed rt as the dependent variable . such results would be the first to our knowledge to demonstrate such associations. our interest in rt slope is to give a more complete picture of what is happening in the minds of those individuals who struggle with attentional deficits, which could potentially lead to better environmental supports and treatments.

RESULTS
all markers were in hardy–weinberg equilibrium . in the following models, we were specifically interested in gene-by-trial interactions because they signal differences in the response time trends across trials depending on genotype .table  <dig> correlations between the dependent variable, genetic markers, and covariates

note that the highest correlation with log transformed rt is the standard deviation of log transformed rt. this is likely due to the mathematical relationship between sd of log rt and log rt

multiple models were tested for each outcome measure . we began with a full model  and compared subsequent models for improved model fit . full models used logarithm transformed rt as the dependent variable and included predictors of interest , covariates , and the interactions of interest . the final  eliminated all covariates except ethnicity. we also tested models removing non-significant interactions, but these did not improve model fit for any cue-target condition. however, bic did improve and the same gene-by-trial interactions  were significant or nearly significant when using a simpler model without including covariates . for parsimony, we settled on the simpler models which showed substantially the same results and had significantly smaller bic values . for every cue-target condition, these were the best models and the improvements over models with all predictors  were significant at p <  <dig> . reporting akaike’s information criterion  instead of bic does not change the model building results in any instance.

for ease of interpretation, this table presents slopes of untransformed rt rather than log transformed rt. italic values indicate significant rt slope differences across genotype by primary measure. to calculate the increase or decrease in average rt across  <dig> trials for individuals with a given genotype, simply multiply the slopes in the table by  <dig> trials. for example, for the dat <dig> 5r/5r genotype for the single dim valid condition: mean =  <dig> trials ×  msec/trial = −112 ms across  <dig> trials 



three of the reduced  models had slopes that were significant. in these cases it was the dat <dig> by trial interactions that were significant. the model with slopes and without covariates for no cue <dig> was significantly better than the model with all predictors  at χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . the dat1 × trial interaction  for no cue was the only significant slope, f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . there were also main effects for dat <dig>  and drd <dig> , but not for trial . the zero risk allele group  had slopes that were significantly steeper  than the one risk allele group, which in turn averaged  <dig>  ms more of a decrease in rt per trial than the two risk allele group. the two-risk allele group had an estimate set to zero in the multilevel model . the zero-risk allele group was significantly different from a flat slope, , as was the one-risk allele group . the differences are easier to visualize in table  <dig> where untransformed rt values show that subjects with zero risk alleles  got about 53 ms faster over the course of the task, while those with two risk alleles  slowed down across the course of the experiment by approximately 17 ms.

the final model for single dim valid was significantly better than the model with all predictors at χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . the dat1 × trial interaction was significant at f =  <dig> , p =  <dig> . the main effects were significant for dat <dig> , comt , and trial . the zero risk group had slopes that were significantly steeper  than individuals in the one risk allele group . those in the zero risk allele group had slopes that were marginally different from a flat slope, t = − <dig> , p =  <dig> . those in the one-risk allele group had slopes that were significantly different from a flat slope, t = − <dig> , p =  <dig> . as can be seen in table  <dig>  subjects with zero risk alleles responded approximately 112 ms faster over the course of the task, while those with two risk alleles  were responding only 19 ms faster by the end of the task.

the final model for single dim invalid was significantly better than the model with all predictors at χ <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> . the main effects were significant for dat <dig> , comt , dbh , and drd <dig> . the main effect for trial was not significant .the dat <dig> zero risk allele group has slopes that are significantly larger . the zero risk allele group had slopes that were significantly different from zero , but the one risk allele group was only marginally different from a flat slope, t = − <dig> , p =  <dig> . subjects with zero risk alleles got about 87 ms faster over the course of the task, while those with two risk alleles  were responding slower by about 17 ms by the end of the task.

discussion
one can think of variability in rt in an attention task across repeated trials in two ways:  random variability from trial to trial that fluctuates around some mean rt, and  a systematic rt slope across trials that tends to make latter rts slower  on average than earlier rts. because it is common to study the moment-to-moment variability of behavioral or physiological measures between genotypes, it is especially interesting to find that genotype also predicts the latter kind of variability in rt in a cued orienting task: the linear component of changes across trials in rt . this was true even after covarying sleepiness, age, self-reported ethnicity, error rate, and moment-to-moment variability, although the statistical analysis led us to settle on the simpler models without these covariates. dat <dig> was the only gene in the simpler models that interacted with trial number in predicting rt slopes. dat <dig> produces a protein involved in the transport of dopamine from the synapse. we note that our task produced the typical costs and benefits of a reflexive attention task  <cit> . therefore, our finding is intriguing because it implies that it is not the nature of the task per se  but possibly that there is a task that transpires across an extended time period.

for dat <dig>  the mean slope increased  across genotypes with increasing numbers of risk alleles for three outcome measures that were significant. the significant outcome measures were conditions in which there was no cue and in which the single cues were dim . the conditions that were not significantly associated with dat <dig> are also interesting. these include the dual asymmetric bright  and dual asymmetric dim conditions , and the neutral both bright and neutral both dim conditions . the single bright valid and invalid cues were also not significant. this all suggests that it is not validity that distinguishes genotype groups . it may be, however, that cue luminance matters  and cue number matters . the risk allele for our genetic marker on dat <dig>  increases production of the dopamine transporter so that the dopaminergic signal is often terminated too soon  <cit> .

one possible conclusion regarding genetic influence on the no-cue and single, dim cue conditions is that bright cues are too salient to distinguish between genotype groups  because dopamine variability in the general population is sufficient for this performance. another possible conclusion regarding genetic influence is that the addition of a second cue induces subjects to perform more similarly to each other across trials than a single cue, again, because dopamine is sufficient with two cues. in a followup analysis with dat <dig>  the number of cues showed a slight statistical trend for association with rt slope  with steeper improvements in rt across trials for the no risk allele  group with one cue trials than with two cue trials. this finding is worth investigation in a future study because it suggests the possibility of an effect in which rt slopes across trials are approximately equal between genotype groups when there are more cues  and if they have any copy of the risk allele . conversely, they respond more quickly across trials if there is only one cue and they have no risk alleles. in other words, subjects respond more similarly across the course of the task when there are two cues, but single cues reflexively capture attention and require a disengage step, which may become more effortful for some subjects over the course of the task.

why would the dat <dig> genotypes be associated with systematic differences in the rate of responding across trials? there are three possible outcomes when examining the interaction between gene and trial in predicting logarithm-transformed rt:  subjects can respond more quickly across trials ,  subjects can respond equally quickly across trials, or  subjects can respond more slowly across trials . also keep in mind that a significant difference in rt slope across trials between genotype groups does not always entail a negative rt slope in one group and a positive rt slope in another group. it could simply mean that the rt slope was less negative in one group than in another, while both groups could show negative slopes. in all cases, the significant effects consisted of less negative or more positive rt slopes across trials associated with more risk alleles for the various genes . recall that possession of more copies of the risk allele on dat <dig> would tend to result in faster transport of dopamine from the synapses. the nature of the behavioral effect is that subjects tend to slow down across the course of the experiment, especially with the 5r/6r and 6r/6r genotypes. one possible explanation for this effect, then, is that an optimal level of dopamine is required to maintain alertness . this is actually not different from saying that the association between dat <dig> and rt slope may be related to vigilance or sustained attention, even though this is a reflexive attention task. there is a large literature for genetic effects of dopamine related genes for sustained attention  <cit> .

in the case of the current results with the reflexive attention task, waning vigilance across the course of the experiment would tend to lead to gradually longer target detection times and longer rts on average despite the reflexive nature of the cue-target trials. this hypothesis would, of course, predict that possession of more dat <dig> risk alleles should have caused a general slowing across trials in all conditions. instead, this effect was observed in three of nine conditions. it is possible that issues of power prevented detection of the effect in the other conditions. nevertheless, dopamine availability, cue luminance and cue number could all be important. we have provided evidence that there are genetic influences on rt trends over the course of a reflexive attention task and not simply on terms of moment-to-moment rt variability.

of course, chance is another possibility that could explain our results. in fact, the biggest limitation of this study regards sample size which all other things being equal tends to make results less replicable. while some authors caution against using sample sizes smaller than  <dig> to explore interaction effects  <cit> , others have noted sufficient power and stability to explore cross-level interactions in multilevel models with sample sizes of 30– <dig> level- <dig> units   <cit>  and at least  <dig> level- <dig> units  per level- <dig> unit. our study certainly met the latter criterion. the best way to handle this question is to replicate this study.

another limitation could be the heterogeneity of our sample. while we see advantages to including multiple ethnicities and ages, population stratification as an artifact is certainly more likely as the heterogeneity of the sample increases. this would argue for a replication with a larger overall sample and more balanced ethnic subsamples. this could lead to more certainty in the generalizability of the results. it would also be advantageous to explore associations with more genetic markers including those that are associated with neurotransmitters other than dopamine.

CONCLUSIONS
over the course of a reflexive visual attention experiment with repeated trials of the same conditions, some subjects fail to respond more quickly to identical stimuli, but others respond more quickly as the task progresses. this is interesting because it suggests the possibility of similar biological mechanisms for sustaining attention to exogenous and endogenous cues  <cit> . however, there are other possibilities. responding more slowly to later presentations of the same stimulus could indicate, for example, fatigue, a build-up of trial-to-trial inhibition, or greater interference from immediately preceding trials. responding more quickly to the same stimulus in later presentations could be considered a simple form of learning. the subject’s task was simply to make a choice response  to a particular target that appeared across trials either unaccompanied by a temporally preceding cue, or accompanied by such a cue that could appear spatially near the target’s position or contralaterally across the visual field from the location of the target.

we asked whether individual differences in these rt slopes in response to the cue-target manipulation were associated with genetic markers for five genes: comt, dat <dig>  dbh, drd <dig>  and apoe. these genes were chosen because they have been shown to be related to various aspects of visual attention in previous research, and because in some cases, there is a plausible biological pathway from the gene to the phenotypes that we used to study visual orienting. dat <dig> genotype was associated with variations in these slopes in three different cue-target conditions. the mean slope increased with increasing numbers of risk alleles. a larger positive mean slope implies that the difference in rt between early trials with a given stimulus and later trials with that same stimulus was greater  for subjects carrying more of the dat <dig> risk alleles. the risk allele was determined based primarily on previous research on related sustained attention tasks.

previous work, including our own, has shown associations between the mean rt in different conditions and various genes, but such associations are like snapshots of genotype/phenotype relations in the sense that the phenotype is not extended in time. it reflects a static aspect of visual attention. in contrast, the phenotypes that we examined were by definition extended in time because they were defined by the slope of rt across repeated presentations of the same stimulus. it was primarily dat <dig> that was associated with these temporally extended phenotypes. the phenotypes reflect how speeded attentional choices change over perhaps a 30 min period filled with repetitions of multiple trial types. however, this temporally extended phenotype could reflect the ability to maintain attentional arousal—the ability to learn to recognize the spatiotemporal configurations of the various trial types in order to respond more discriminatively when they appear again—or other processes that systematically alter rts across an extended period of time. our results suggest that the dat <dig> gene is a promising candidate for understanding the underlying pathways involved in these more temporally extended aspects of either reflexive or sustained visual attention.
