BACKGROUND
as one of the most widely cultivated fruit crops, grapes cover about seven million hectares of arable land worldwide . however, a large portion of the world’s wine producing areas are located in regions that currently suffer, or that are expected to encounter in the future, water deficits. in these areas, seasonal droughts coincide with the grapevine growing season   <cit> , and the most important factor limiting grapevine growth in the mediterranean is water stress  <cit> . in such areas, the combined effect of prolonged or recurrent drought events, large leaf-to-air vapor pressure gradients, and high air temperatures during the summer are known to limit grapevine yield, fruit metabolism and, consequently, wine quality  <cit> .

grapevines tend to adjust their leaf water balance by regulating the flow of water both to the leaf and from the leaf to the atmosphere. the plant’s hydraulic regulation is mediated by aquaporins  <cit>  and vessel anatomy  <cit> , and water loss via the leaves is regulated by stomatal conductance – which is, in turn, modulated by hormonal balance  <cit>  – and leaf area  <cit> . it is generally accepted that vitis vinifera cultivars possess significant variability in their hydraulic behavior  <cit> , a feature reflected in the cultivar-specific responses to water deficit. differences in drought tolerance between cultivars  <cit>  are likely due to differences in root to shoot signaling and differential hydraulic regulation between cultivars  <cit> . recently, quantitative trait loci  associated with grape hydraulic regulation were localized  <cit> , suggesting a complex, regulatory process for this trait. the combination in grape cultivars of genotypic similarity and varied hydraulic behaviors established grapevines as an excellent model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying plant response to water deficit.

plant molecular response to drought includes the production of compatible osmolytes  <cit> . recent vine studies, including transcriptome and metabolome analyses, showed that processes associated with osmotic adjustment, protection against photoinhibition, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species were induced in response to drought conditions  <cit> . water deficit also induces the synthesis of protective proteins, such as dehydrins and late-embryogenesis abundant  proteins, and the expression of water and ion transporters to maintain water and ion homeostasis  <cit> . in addition, prolonged stress can trigger changes at the leaf surface in the cuticle structure and cell walls can be triggered by prolonged stresses  <cit> . these mechanisms include the concerted action of large groups of genes  <cit> . moreover, genotype-environment interaction further exacerbates the complexity of the stress response in grapevines  <cit> .

in plants, correlation network  has become an increasingly popular tool to represent the relationships of metabolites  <cit> . cn holds key features allowing for the analysis of coordinated changes of metabolites based on correlation coefficients. moreover, cn enables the integration of information of diverse backgrounds  elucidating the structure and regulation of a metabolic network, and it is employed in time-resolved experiments to identify genes regulating developmental and growth associated processes  <cit> . metabolic cns were employed, with genome-wide association mapping in arabidopsis accession lines, to study the mode of inheritance of metabolic traits in seeds and fruits and their interactions  <cit> . another study used cns highlighting metabolic modules in a seed whose resilience to perturbation is indicative of the relevance of maintaining specific metabolite ratios  <cit> .

in the present study, we explored the metabolic response of grapevine to progressive water deficit; changes in the central and specialized metabolisms of the two hydraulically different cultivars  <cit> , cabernet sauvignon and shiraz, were monitored during progressive water deficit treatment; leaf and sap metabolite profiles were integrated via network analysis to discern the metabolic basis of vine adjustments to stress. the findings are discussed with respect to the current knowledge about grape physiology and plant molecular responses to water deficit.

RESULTS
a significant variability was shown in the physiological responses to water deficit  between the cultivars cabernet sauvignon and shiraz  <cit> . here, the effect of progressive water deficit on leaf metabolism was investigated in the same plants. leaves were analyzed by profiling their central and specialized metabolites, performing elemental analysis, and measuring osmolality.

periodic measurements of osmolyte content  suggested that significant changes in leaf metabolism occurred in both cultivars in response to progressive water deficit. although osmolyte concentration  increased in d treated plants of both cultivars, the increase was sharper in shiraz. for example, on day  <dig> of the experiment, π in cabernet sauvignon leaves was 582 mmol/kg whereas in those of shiraz it was 635 mmol/kg . a high correlation was found between π and leaf water potential, Ψl, . significantly lower c/n ratio  was exhibited in plants subjected to d compared with plants exposed to the irrigated  condition . moreover, c/n differences between the treatments were larger in shiraz  than in cabernet sauvignon .

comparative profiling of central and specialized metabolism of shiraz and cabernet sauvignon under progressive water deficit
metabolic profiling of the leaves unequivocally identified  <dig> annotated metabolites by gc/ms and  <dig> metabolites by lc/ms. metabolite profiles of leaves were first analyzed by pca . in the gc/ms based analysis of central metabolites , the first principal component  – explaining the greatest variance  across the dataset – separated the samples across sampling days . galactinol, gly, quercetin, lignin precursors, ferulate and trans-5-o-caffeoyl-d-quinate  <cit>  were the main metabolites contributing to the dispersion of the samples on pc <dig> . levels of quercetin and trans-5-o-caffeoyl-d-quinate changed by up to 1000-fold  during the course of the experiment . the second component  explained  <dig> % of the variance and separated the samples according to the irrigated and water deficit treatments . mainly changes in the abundance of pro, galactinol, glycerate and galactonate  were responsible for sample dispersion along pc <dig>  a significantly greater average fold change in metabolite abundance between the water deficit and irrigated treatments during later stages of the experiment  more clearly resolved the differences between shiraz and cabernet sauvignon . finally, the samples separated according to cultivar affiliation based on the third component , which explained only 9% of the variance and was contributed mostly by quinate, quercetin and threonate suggesting an overall similarity in the grapevine metabolic response to progressive water deficit.

lc/ms based pca  showed that the two cultivars separated along pc <dig> , a finding attributed mainly to the tartaric esters , 4-o-caffeoyl-d-quinate and quercetin-3-o-glucuronide. expectedly, similar to the gc/ms based profiling, progressive water deficit led to increased separation between the treatments . the lc/ms data subjected to orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis  identified metabolic markers for drought response . opls-da generated s-plot visualizing the magnitude of the contribution to the separation between water treatments made by molecular related ions   <cit> . accordingly, the larger effect of the treatment on the dataset was measured in shiraz on day  <dig> of the experiment as reflected by the s-shaped data distribution . among hundreds of markers, the analysis notably highlighted trp, phe, citrate, tartarate and catechin as highly affected by the d treatment in shiraz .

proline and branched chain amino acid accumulation correlate with water deficit driven changes in leaf water potential
gc/ms based metabolite profiling of leaves of the two vine genotypes showed larger changes in shiraz than in cabernet sauvignon in response to progressive water deficit . in accordance with c:n ratio measurements , marked increases were observed in most amino acids  and a correspondingly strong decrease  in the abundance of most organic acids in both cultivars in response to stress . on day  <dig> of the experiment, the amino acids pro, val, leu, thr and trp were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times higher, respectively, in water deficit than in irrigated samples in shiraz. similar results were found for cabernet sauvignon, where the same amino acids were elevated by  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively, in water deficit samples as compared with irrigated samples. even phe levels, of which initially decreased in plants under d treatment, was 52- and 21-fold higher on day  <dig> under water deficit conditions . glu, the only amino acid to display opposite trends between the two cultivars in response to stress, increased by  <dig> -fold in shiraz but decreased by 1/ <dig> in cabernet sauvignon across all sampling days .

correlation analysis of the gc/ms based metabolite profile with physiological parameters showed that levels of pro , val  and leu  were strongly correlated with leaf water potential Ψl . nonetheless, the contribution of amino acids to Ψl was relatively small. comparison of amino acids, as was quantified by standard calibration curves, to the osmolyte concentration showed that amino acids accounted for less than 1% of π.

in response to stress, a decrease in most organic acids  was measured markedly in shiraz and less in cabernet sauvignon . the most intensely depleted metabolites were glycerate and galactonate, which in the wake of water stress were reduced to 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> of their original levels, respectively, in shiraz, and to 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> of their original levels, respectively, in cabernet sauvignon on day  <dig> of the experiment . in contrast, nicotinate were the only measured organic acid that accumulated in response to stress in both cultivars and at all three time points. nicotinate was elevated by  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, at day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, in shiraz, and by  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in cabernet sauvignon . finally, inconsistent trends were observed for tca intermediates during the experiment and between the cultivars. for example, like citrate, malate showed a significant accumulation in response to water deficit, but only in shiraz . while succinate levels in both cultivars were significantly lower  in stressed plants on days  <dig> and  <dig> of the experiment, they showed no significant change on day  <dig> , likewise fumarate did not change across the experiment. taken together, the extent of the changes in primary metabolism under severe stress  was greater in shiraz as compared with cabernet sauvignon; both the average fold change of each metabolite and the number of significantly changed metabolites  were larger in shiraz .

changes in specialized metabolism under progressive water deficit are genotype specific
changes in the secondary metabolism were generally milder in magnitude than those measured for the central metabolites, and they were greater in shiraz than in cabernet sauvignon . furthermore, the opls-da on the lc-ms dataset, which included hundreds of markers, highlighted mostly primary metabolites  as major contributors to the differences between treatments . the flavanols catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin and procyanidin dimer b <dig> and the non-flavonoid phenolic compounds were significantly decreased under water deficit in both genotypes . in contrast, the abundance of quercetin-3-o-galactoside and rutin increased significantly  in shiraz water deficit plants but not in cabernet sauvignon .

correlation-based network analysis to identify coordinated stress induced metabolic perturbation
four networks were generated by correlation-based network analysis of the four sets of data profiles from the two different cultivars  under the two conditions  across the sampling data-points: shiraz water deficit, shiraz irrigated, cabernet sauvignon water deficit, and cabernet sauvignon irrigated plants . at q-value <  <dig>  and r >  <dig> , water stress caused a slight increase in the number of edges in cabernet sauvignon from  <dig> to  <dig>  network density, from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and average node degree, from  <dig>  to  <dig> . overall, shiraz networks were characterized by greater numbers of edges compared to cabernet sauvignon networks. under irrigated conditions the shiraz network had  <dig> edges, which markedly increased by 50% under water deficit conditions .

to investigate the statistical significance of network differences we performed permutations test . interestingly, none of the cabernet sauvignon ir permutations resulted in viable networks. exclusively, all resulting networks contained zero nodes and consequently no edges. the  <dig> permutation networks generated for the cabernet sauvignons d dataset, resulted in  <dig> no network,  <dig> one-node,  <dig> two-node,  <dig> three-node,  <dig> four-node,  <dig> five-node, and  <dig> six-node network. due to the non-comparability of the permutation network parameters to the initially observed network parameter, the differences recorded between cabernet sauvignon ir and cabernet sauvignon d are highly significant . a different picture arose for the comparison of the shiraz permuted networks to the shiraz initial networks. here, all permutations resulted in viable networks for shiraz ir permuted as well as for shiraz d permuted. nevertheless, none of the monitored differences in network parameters equaled or exceeded the initially observed difference between treatments, respectively, e.g., the difference of network density of shiraz d  and sh ir  resulting in a value of  <dig>  was never achieved. these findings also render the differences between treatments highly significant .

the varietal difference in metabolic response to stress can be appreciated by comparing the graphs  where red edges are specific to the water deficit treatment. between-cultivar differences are visualized in the symmetric difference networks , in which blue edges are specific to shiraz and red edges are specific to cabernet sauvignon. the sdn emphasize the presence of highly connected cultivar specific nodes. for example, the irrigated sdn comprises  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges,  <dig> edges are specific to cabernet sauvignon and  <dig> are specific to shiraz, a ratio of  <dig> to  <dig>  . notably, all  <dig> edges of the lignin precursor trans-5-o-caffeoyl-d-quinate are specific to cabernet sauvignon, while ethanolamine has  <dig> edges, of which  <dig> are specific to cabernet sauvignon. in contrast, epigallocatechin has  <dig> edges,  <dig> of which are specific to shiraz, and  <dig> of quercetin’s  <dig> edges are also specific to shiraz. similar results were found for the sdn created for the water deficit treatment. this network comprised  <dig> nodes and  <dig> edges, of which  <dig> are specific to cabernet sauvignon and  <dig> are specific to shiraz, a ratio of  <dig> to  <dig> . the predominance in the two sdns of shiraz specific edges, especially under progressive water deficit conditions, emphasizes the extent to which shiraz underwent coordinated metabolic rearrangements. the nodal degrees of epigallocatechin , quercetin  and ethanolamine  were particularly high in the shiraz cultivar.

to estimate the extent of change in network structure during the progressive water deficit treatment and to identify metabolites with stress related structural features, the ratios of each metabolite nodal degree between the irrigated and water deficit networks were quantified . in both cultivars gallic acid played an important role in the structure of the network under irrigated conditions, but under water deficit conditions, the bulk of its contribution to connectivity was lost. among the  <dig> metabolites in shiraz most dramatically altered in terms of connectedness,  <dig> were amino acids, together with ser-derived ethanolamine, ascorbate, fumarate, butanoate derivatives, ferulate and quercetin, and, some were sugars, including ribulose, melibiose and raffinose. notably, the analysis highlighted the change in the structural role of pro within the shiraz network: under conditions of progressive water deficit, pro lost all of its relations with the rest of the network, likely acquiring a unique role as an osmolyte. in cabernet sauvignon, among the first  <dig> metabolites whose connectedness was altered, six were amino acids. of the organic acids, succinate, threonate, glutarate, malonate and  <dig>  di-hydroxy benzoate exhibited changes in their connectedness. among cabernet sauvignon sugars, raffinose was the most powerfully affected by the conditions of water deficit, but its nodal degree  was smaller in cabernet sauvignon than in shiraz.

sap metabolism and stress response
lc/ms analysis of the phloem sap of plants grown under irrigated conditions identified  <dig> metabolites,  <dig> of which were significantly different between the cultivars . compared to cabernet sauvignon, shiraz had higher levels of astilbin  and hydroxybenzoate , whereas cabernet sauvignon sap was characterized by a markedly higher level of epigallocatechin  than shiraz . levels of the coumarate derivatives coumaroyl tartarate and p-coumarate hexose varied significantly between the cultivars, but no consistent trend was observed during the experiment. likewise, abscisic acid was identified in the sap of irrigated cabernet sauvignon at a higher level  than in shiraz, but this pattern was not consistent throughout the experiment . nevertheless, its content increased 5 - 6-fold in response to water deficit in both cultivars , and it was found to be strongly correlated with stomatal conductance gs . genotypic differences were shown for all three detected hydroxybenzoate forms , which in response to water deficit accumulated in the sap of shiraz  but did not change in cabernet sauvignon . hydroxybenzoate derived suberin was consistently shown to accumulate under water deficit conditions in the vascular systems of both cultivars. after 34 days without irrigation, suberin levels doubled in cabernet sauvignon and more than tripled in shiraz, compared with the cultivars under the irrigated treatment .

discussion
grapevine response to water deficit varies between cultivars apparently with respect to cultivar hydraulic behavior and genotype. nevertheless, few studies have investigated the variability in the metabolic response to water deficit between genotypes. here, two vine cultivars, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon, with different hydraulic behaviors  <cit>  were exposed to long-term  water deficit. shiraz showed larger stress related changes in metabolite abundance and in the number of significantly altered metabolites. across the metabolite profiles of central and secondary metabolism, primary metabolites were significantly more responsive to the stress compared to the identified secondary metabolites.

during the course of the experiment, the observed reduction in leaf water potential  could be partly explained by the increase in osmolality , which was found to be correlated with amino acid content. the stress-induced increase in amino acids  was previously observed in grapevines  <cit>  and in other plant species  <cit> . the most significant increase in abundance among the amino acids was that of pro, which was also strongly correlated with Ψl and contributed most of the variance to the dispersion along pc <dig>  which differentiate between the irrigation treatments. pro accumulation is one of the most common and well-known responses of plants to dehydration  <cit> . however, when quantified against standard calibration curves, our measurements detected very small pro concentrations, rendering it of negligible osmotic significance. this finding supports previous ones showing that compared to inorganic ions, amino acids made relatively small contributions to osmotic potential  <cit> .

processes that have been suggested to contribute to the accumulation in amino acids that leads to the observed decrease in the c:n ratio include the oxidative stress response  <cit> , enhanced protein catabolism, nitrogen re-allocation driven by growth inhibition  <cit> , and a shift in the proteome expressed as the production of greater numbers of stress-associated proteins  <cit> , thereby enhancing, as our results imply, the biosynthesis of amino acids at the expense of c metabolites. alternatively, the reduction in the c:n ratio measured in our study may be the result of the increased proportion of photorespiration/photosynthesis measured in grape leaves under stress conditions  <cit> . for example, it was shown that no <dig> assimilation is dependent on photorespiration  <cit> , and therefore, nitrogen assimilation is likely enhanced  under stress conditions. that being said, other studies have suggested that the stimulation of n uptake and n assimilation are regulated by photosynthesis  and that under drought stress the inactivation of nitrate reductase lowers n assimilation  <cit> . these lines of evidence emphasize the complexity of plant responses to stresses, dictating the need for additional comparative works into the regulation of c/n status and amino acid functional role under water stress.

the maintenance of higher leaf water potential by cabernet sauvignon could be attributed to a higher basal aba level in the phloem sap leading to lower stomatal conductance under mild to moderate stress , as defined by  <cit> . this hypothesis is further supported by the high correlation found between stomatal conductance and aba and by previous findings of the involvement of aba in the control of the former  <cit> . aba is thought to control stomatal opening by affecting the biochemistry of guard cells, and by changing leaf hydraulic conductivity through modulation of permeability within vascular tissues, likely affecting aquaporin regulation  <cit> . additionally to its role in hydraulic regulation, aba is a central regulator of plant stress responses and was shown to modulate growth  <cit>  and sugar transport, synthesis, and degradation  <cit> . having said that, under severe stress , sap aba levels were similar in both genotypes. it is possible that cultivar variability in the above mentioned downstream processes of aba contributed to the metabolic differences measured between the cultivars.

the link between stress tolerance and the regulation of water transport was suggested to be influenced by anatomical changes in the plant  <cit> . in the present study suberin was shown to accumulate under water deficit more in the vascular bundles of shiraz than in those of cabernet sauvignon . along with cutin, suberin is involved in the control of the movement of gases, water and solutes in plants  <cit> . while little is known about this fatty-acid–derived insoluble polymer, according to de simone et al.  <cit> , more than 85% of the aromatic moiety of suberin is composed of hydroxybenzoate  <cit> . sap metabolite profiling identified increased abundance of benzoate and ferulate derivatives in the extracts of shiraz when exposed to water deficit, suggesting enhanced suberin biosynthesis. moreover, changes in the levels of metabolized shikimate, quinates, coumarines and flavonoids strongly suggest modulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. additionally, gallic acid and quinate, both linked with the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit>  and associated to ros scavenging  <cit> , were highlighted by the asymmetric networks to be highly coordinated under ir and d conditions respectively. known as a general stress response in plants  <cit> , the phenylpropanoid pathway can support generation of the building blocks for suberin  <cit> . lastly, the association between suberin accumulation and differences in hydraulic behavior was previously observed in grapevines, lending support to our results  <cit> . taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that enhanced suberin biosynthesis is induced in shiraz to cope with the increasingly lower leaf water potential. significant genotypic differences observed in quinate metabolism  and the existing gaps in the scientific knowledge about caffeoyl quinate metabolism dictate the need for more work.

correlation-based network analysis  revealed that extensive topological network differences exist between the two grape cultivars. cna of plants exposed to water stress showed a marked increase in the coordinated metabolic activities of the shiraz cultivar in contrast to cabernet sauvignon plants, the latter of which were able to withstand the water stress with less metabolic changes. in addition, cna emphasized the structural role of key stress metabolites, e.g., pro. the increased network density and connectedness shown here, suggestive of tighter regulation imposed on metabolism, contradict the hypothesis that stress lowers the number of relations and subsequently has a negative effect on network stability  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, an increase in metabolic network connectivity in response to water stress has not been observed in any organism. however, sanchez et al.  <cit>  showed that the correlation coefficient between metabolites of lotus genotypes increased when they were subjected to salt stress, which may lead to higher network connectivity. we hypothesize that regulatory mechanisms under water deficit induce a concerted change in metabolism that allows the cell to cope with the new condition and that leads to more dependent metabolic profiles. the differential magnitudes  of the metabolic changes undergone by the two cultivars exposed to water deficit likely reflect corresponding differences in water stress tolerance. cabernet sauvignon, therefore, appears to be more stress tolerant than shiraz, and as such, it does not require extensive, coordinated metabolic shifts in the wake of its exposure to stress.

our analysis stresses the link between primary metabolism and water deficit, while variability in secondary metabolism was cultivar-dependent. the data suggest that vitis vinifera cultivars possess qualitatively similar metabolic responses. the magnitude of each, at least in part, depends on the plant’s capacity to maintain its water balance. metabolic data integrated via network analysis indicate that hydraulic regulation is a prominent modulatory element used to ameliorate the perturbation of cellular metabolism and highlights its benefits to the plant exposed to severe stress.

CONCLUSIONS
vitis vinifera cultivars undergo a generally conserved and highly coordinated metabolic shift during their stress responses. changes in leaf metabolite content were evident based on the observed increase in osmolality and shift toward smaller c:n values. both processes reflected the general accumulation of amino acids, a few of which, including pro, were found to be correlated with Ψl. the role of amino acid accumulation in the vine in response to water deficit, however, must be more thoroughly assessed. grapevine sap analysis highlighted the association of aba and benzoate metabolism with the stress response. quantitative differences between grapevine cultivars revealed by network analysis but not yet fully understood, indicate the need for further research to elucidate the genotype specific details of physiological and molecular modulation. network analysis was shown as an effective method to display differential response to stress among genotypes and identify biologically relevant metabolites.
