BACKGROUND
aeropyrum pernix is a hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon isolated from the seas of japan, and its complete genome sequence has been reported  <cit> . most of the hyperthermophilic archaea grow anaerobically, but this archaeon is strictly aerobic and grows optimally at 90-95°c at neutral ph. analysis of the respiratory chain of the organism is important for understanding the mechanism of aerobic growth in such environments. however, there are only a few reports about the bioenergetics of a. pernix.

many bacteria and archaea have  <dig> to  <dig> terminal oxidases in the respiratory chain  <cit> . the heme-copper oxidase superfamily can be classified into  <dig> subfamilies  on the basis of the amino acid sequence of subunit i  <cit> . the group of a-type oxidases includes mitochondrial cytochrome aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase  and many other bacterial oxidases. in contrast, b-type oxidases have been identified mainly from extremophiles, including thermophilic bacteria, such as geobacillus thermodenitrificans   <cit>  and thermus thermophilus  <cit> , and archaea, such as sulfolobus acidocaldarius  <cit> . analysis of the complete genome sequence of a. pernix has shown that it contains a- and b-type heme-copper terminal oxidases . ishikawa et al. isolated  <dig> terminal oxidases from a. pernix and designated them as cytochrome ba3-type  and aa3-type  cytochrome c oxidases, respectively  <cit> . both oxidases have a cua binding motif, but its substrates have not been identified in the genome sequence.

an extremely haloalkaliphilic archaeon, natronomonas pharaonis, uses a blue copper protein named halocyanin as a substrate for the terminal oxidase instead of cytochrome c  <cit> . in s. acidocaldarius, a blue copper protein named sulfocyanin, which is a part of the soxm supercomplex, is an intermediate in the electron transfer from the bc1-analogous complex to the terminal oxidase  <cit> . however, no genes for blue copper proteins homologous to halocyanin or sulfocyanin have been found in the genome of a. pernix. therefore, although these oxidases can use n,n,n',n'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine  and/or bovine cytochrome c as substrates in vitro, the authentic substrate of the two terminal oxidases is not known.

in contrast to terminal oxidases, complex iii of archaea is not well-known and a canonical bc <dig> complex has not been identified in any archaeal genome  <cit> . among the subunit components of the bc complex, both cytochrome b and rieske fe/s protein are widely conserved, while the c-type cytochrome subunit has diverged into several classes, some of which show no sequence similarity to the class of cytochrome c <dig> subunits  <cit> . this is compatible with the view that the functional and evolutionary core of the bc complex includes cytochrome b and the peripheral domain of the rieske fe/s protein and that different c-type cytochromes have been recruited independently several times during molecular evolution. generally, a c-type cytochrome has been reported only for a limited number of archaeal species, such as halophiles and thermoacidophiles, in contrast to a/o-type and b-type cytochromes, which seem ubiquitous in the respiratory chains of archaeal species. focusing on homologues of the cytochrome bc components, cytochrome b and rieske fe/s proteins are present in some archaeal species, such as sulfolobus, and constitute supercomplexes with oxidase subunits  <cit> , whereas cytochrome c components are missing even in those organisms. several bc1-analogous complexes have been identified thus far in archaea such as halobacterium salinarum  <cit>  and acidianus ambivalens  <cit> .

in this study, we isolated c-type cytochromes from the membranes of a. pernix k <dig> cells and characterized the spectroscopic and enzymatic properties of the cytochromes. our data indicate that the isolated c-type cytochrome is equivalent to the cytochrome c subunit of the bc complex and forms a supercomplex with cytochrome c oxidase.

RESULTS
isolation of a membrane bound c-type cytochrome from a. pernix
we isolated a membrane bound c-type cytochrome from the membranes and designated it cytochrome c <dig>  a cytochrome oxidase was also isolated and designated cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase, as shown later. a. pernix k <dig> cells were harvested in the early stationary phase, and membranes were prepared. the membrane proteins were solubilized with ddm and fractionated using 3-step chromatography. in the first deae-toyopearl column chromatography, the cytochrome c <dig> and cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase were mainly eluted with  <dig> mm nacl . also in the second q-sepharose column chromatography, the cytohrome c <dig> eluted together with the cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase at ~ <dig> mm nacl . interestingly, the peak fractions from q-sepharose, including cytochrome c <dig> and oa <dig> oxidase, showed not only tmpd oxidation activity  but also menaquinol oxidation activity . this suggested that cytochrome c <dig> and cytochrome c oxidase interact. subsequent chromatography on a hydroxyapatite column separated the cytochrome c <dig> and cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase into  <dig> peaks . table  <dig> shows a summary of the purification of cytochrome c <dig>  the c-type cytochrome content was enriched approximately  <dig> -fold during the purification.

spectroscopic properties of cytochromes in a. pernix
the redox difference spectrum of membranes showed α-band peaks with maxima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm , derived from c- and a-type cytochromes, respectively. the isolated cytochrome c <dig> in the reduced state showed an absorption peak at  <dig> nm . the pyridine ferro-hemochrome spectrum showed  <dig> α-band peaks with maxima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm, indicating the presence of heme c and heme b   <cit> . the redox spectrum of the cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase showed α-band peaks with maxima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm  and the pyridine ferro-hemochrome spectrum did α-band peaks with maxima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm , indicating the presence of heme o and heme a  <cit> . to determine the heme species of the oxidase in more detail, total heme was extracted from the partially purified oxidase preparation and analyzed by mass spectrometry. we observed  <dig> peaks at molecular masses of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . the molecular mass of  <dig>  matches that of heme op <dig>  which was identified in sulfolobus and other species  <cit> , while the molecular mass of  <dig>  matches that of heme as. the molecular mass of  <dig>  matches that of heme b, which is probably contamination from other cytochromes, because the peak height is lower than those of hemes op <dig> and as, and this oxidase does not contain b-type heme . the difference spectrum of the co-bound, reduced form minus the reduced form showed a peak and a trough at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively, in the α region  and those at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm in the γ region , indicating that co was bound to an a-type heme , and thus the oxidase was designated a cytochrome oa3-type.

polypeptide composition and enzyme activities
sds-page showed mainly  <dig> polypeptide bands for cytochrome c <dig> with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda . the 25-kda band was visualized with heme staining . we performed mass analysis for the  <dig> bands at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda using a maldi-tof/ms spectrometer. the 40- and 30-kda polypeptides could not be identified. the 25-kda polypeptide, which was positive for heme staining, had a molecular mass of  <dig>  . the theoretical mass of the ape_ <dig>  gene, which encodes the hypothetical cytochrome c subunit of the bc complex, was  <dig> . the calculated mass of the ape_ <dig>  gene product, which is the hypothetical cytochrome c polypeptide of the bc complex, is  <dig> . on a bn-page gel, cytochrome c <dig> migrated at  <dig> kda as a single band . the entire panel was excised and processed by two-dimensional sds-page. the 80-kda band consisted of  <dig> main polypeptides as shown by sds-page  indicating that these  <dig> polypeptides form a complex. for partially purified cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase, sds-page showed  <dig> polypeptide bands with apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda . the 25-kda band was visualized by heme staining, suggesting this band was derived from cytochrome c <dig> . bn-page showed a band at  <dig> kda, which had tmpd oxidase activity, suggesting that the band contain a cytochrome c oxidase . the 140-kda band was separated by sds-page and found to consist of  <dig> main polypeptides as shown by sds-page .

the isolated cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase had tmpd and yeast cytochrome c oxidation activity, with values of  <dig> and  <dig>  μmol min- <dig> mg- <dig>  respectively, while the cytochrome c <dig> complex did not show any oxidase activity. on the other hand, cytochrome c <dig> oxidized menaquinol and reduced yeast cytochrome c , i.e. showed activity similar to that of quinone: cytochrome c oxidoreductase, while isolated cytochrome oa <dig> did not oxidize menaquinol. interestingly, after adding the fractions containing cytochrome c <dig> to cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase, tmpd oxidase activity increased ~  <dig> -fold .

discussion
in this study, we isolated a membrane bound cytochrome c <dig> from the strictly aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon, a. pernix. sds-page analysis showed  <dig> bands at apparent molecular masses of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> kda . the measured molecular mass of the 25-kda band, which was positive for heme staining, was close to the calculated molecular mass for the hypothetical cytochrome c subunit encoded by orf ape_ <dig>  . cytochrome c <dig> preparations contained heme b and heme c  and catalyzed electron transfer from menaquinone to yeast cytochrome c. on the basis of these results, we concluded that cytochrome c <dig> was part of the cytochrome bc complex and that the  <dig> bands identified by sds-page analysis corresponded to cytochrome b, rieske/fes, and cytochrome c subunits. data from bn-page analysis supported the idea that these  <dig> bands are part of the bc complex . the gene for the cytochrome c polypetide, ape_ <dig>  contains a cxxchxnm motif but does not show high sequence similarity to cytochrome c <dig> or the other classes of bacterial or eukaryotic c-type components. it is generally difficult to isolate bc complexes from membranes because of their general instability, but the heat stability of this enzyme probably permitted its isolation in this study.

we also isolated a cytochrome oa3-type cytochrome c oxidase from a. pernix membranes. based on polypeptide sizes, the upper  <dig> bands identified by sds-page  probably corresponded to aoxa  and aoxb . thus, the partially purified cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase here is likely the a-type oxidase identified by ishikawa et al. previously  <cit> . interestingly, cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase comigrated with the bc complex through the deae-toyopearl and q-sepharose chromatographies, but the enzymes were separated during the subsequent hydroxyapatite chromatography . furthermore, peak fractions from the q-sepharose column, which included the bc complex and cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase, had menaquinol oxidase activity. these findings suggest that cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase forms a supercomplex with the bc complex as observed in some species, such as thermophilic bacillus ps <dig>  <cit> , corynebacterium glutamicum  <cit> , and s. acidocaldarius  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we showed that a. pernix has a bc complex which includes a c-type cytochrome, and that the bc complex forms supercomplex with the cytochrome oa <dig> oxidase. an electron donor candidate for cytochrome c oxidase, such as a blue copper protein, has not yet been identified in the whole genome data of this archaeon. taken together, it might be suggested that the cytochrome c <dig> is the direct electron donor for the oxidase, which would explain the apparent lack of a donor such as a copper protein. we are currently trying to identify an authentic substrate between a bc complex and terminal oxidase.
