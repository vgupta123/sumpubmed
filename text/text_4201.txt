BACKGROUND
the signal recognition particle  participates in the vital compartmentalization of every cell by guiding proteins towards their membrane translocation sites. except in chloroplasts  <cit> , srp is a ribonucleoprotein which is composed of the srp rna and at least one protein, the exceptionally conserved srp <dig>  srp interacts with secretory signal or membrane-anchor sequences as they emerge from the ribosomal exit tunnel and delays or blocks the translation of the to-be-targeted polypeptides. subsequently, the srp-ribosome nascent chain  complex binds to a subunit of the membrane-associated srp receptor . srp <dig> and srα each recruit a guanosine triphosphate molecule and, upon the hydrolysis of both gtps, the synchronized release of the signal sequence promotes the secretory protein to enter a protein-conducting channel  of the er. the srp returns to its free cytosolic state and initiates another protein targeting cycle  <cit> .

the mammalian srp is composed of an 303-nucleotide srp rna and proteins srp9/ <dig>  srp <dig>  srp <dig> and srp68/ <dig>  <cit> . responsible for the translation delay are srp9/ <dig> and the terminal srp rna regions which form the small domain  of the elongated dumbbell shaped srp. the large or s-domain participates in gtp-hydrolysis and signal peptide binding and release. it is composed of proteins srp <dig>  srp <dig>  and srp68/ <dig> bound to srp rna helices  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . protein srp <dig> was shown to form an unusually stable heterodimer with srp <dig>  <cit>  but also to bind to the srp rna independently of srp <dig> or other components  <cit> .

cryo-electron microscopy combined with site-directed mutagenesis and footprinting experiments demonstrated that srp <dig> possesses numerous contacts with the srp rna of the large srp domain  <cit> . in contrast, srp <dig> bound to a relatively small section of helix  <dig> which included the 11-nucleotide 5e motif, present in the larger srp rnas and composed of four symmetrically arranged base pairs interrupted by a three-nucleotide loop  <cit> . in eukaryotes, the first nucleotide of the loop  proved to be critical for the binding of protein srp <dig>  <cit> .

several high-resolution structures of substantial portions of the srps from a variety of taxa have been solved and this knowledge contributed significantly to our understanding of how the srp assembles and fulfills a multitude of functions  <cit> . despite their vital importance for srp assembly and essential contributions to the targeting of secretory polypeptides to the er  <cit>  detailed structural information about the srp <dig> and srp <dig> proteins is still lacking.

the focus of the presented work is human protein srp <dig>  the largest of the srp proteins , and its association with the srp rna. full-length srp <dig> as well as a fragment of srp <dig>  were shown to bind independently and specifically to human srp rna with a k'a of  <dig>  ×  <dig> m- <dig>  the rna-binding srp <dig> fragments shared a conserved region with the consensus sequence pdpxrwlpxxer at positions  <dig> to  <dig>  and a cluster of positively charged amino acid residues at positions  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . we used site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic structure probing to investigate the interaction between human srp <dig> and the 5e srp rna motif. the data supported a three-dimensional model in which the 5e motif is at the center of a new rna k-turn which engages the lysine-rich loop of srp <dig> as well as certain amino acid residues from the pdpxrwlpxxer pfam motif.

RESULTS
the minimal srp rna binding domain of human srp72
human srp <dig>  composed of  <dig> amino acids, had a molecular mass of  <dig>  dalton, a pki of  <dig> , and  <dig> % identity to its canine homologue  <cit> . the protein was shown previously to bind independently and specifically to the srp rna  <cit> . a fragment of srp <dig>  also formed complexes with the full-length srp rna as well as with rna fragments derived from the large domain of the srp  <cit> .

purified polypeptide 72e was used as the substrate for the initial site-directed mutagenesis experiments designed to identify the smallest polypeptide with undiminished rna binding activity. the rna ligand was a 46-nucleotide hairpin which contained the 5e motif . recombinant polypeptides were purified to homogeneity using affinity column  based approaches as described in methods. ni-nta magnetic agarose bead were used to monitor the formation of complexes between his-tagged 72e or its purified mutant derivatives and the in vitro transcribed 5e rna. molecules which co-eluted from the beads in a buffer containing  <dig> mm imidazole were analyzed by sds page and stained with coomassie blue and ethidium bromide . the results shown in figure  <dig> demonstrated that three polypeptides lacking several amino acid resides from the termini of 72e, namely 72f, 72h, and 72j, still were capable to form complexes with the 5e rna. in contrast, 72g which was two amino acid residues shorter than the active 72f was unable to bind. because previous experiments had shown that a chymotryptic cleavage at y <dig> retained the ability to form a complex with the rna, the c-terminus of the minimal active srp <dig> rna binding site appeared to include both tyrosines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> whereas r <dig> was dispensable  <cit> . the rna binding activity of 72j suggested that, towards the n-terminus, the residues at positions  <dig> to  <dig> were not required. as was discovered later, removal of five additional residues in 72k  was also tolerated indicating that the n-terminus of the rna binding region was located at or close to residue e <dig>  polypeptide 72i, shortened by six n-terminal residues when compared to 72k was expressed but subject to extensive proteolytic digestion and therefore not amenable to investigation . variable amounts of ethidium bromide-stained material with a molecular mass larger than that of the 5e rna were seen on the gel and likely represented dimeric forms of 5e. the dimers lacked a hairpin loop but contained two tandem 5e motifs and were expected to bind to 72e as was indeed observed .

site-directed mutagenesis of the c-terminal region and the cluster of lysine residues
a recently updated alignment of  <dig> eukaryotic srp <dig> sequences  <cit>  confirmed the presence of two previously identified prominent features within the srp rna binding region of srp <dig>  the first corresponded to a lysine-rich region, kkkkkkkkgk, at positions  <dig> to  <dig> of the human protein. the second region was a previously discovered pfam motif , unique to srp <dig>  with the consensus sequence pdpxrwlpxxer at residues  <dig> to  <dig> . the distinctive properties of these regions prompted us to investigate by site-directed mutagenesis their contributions to the binding of srp <dig> to the srp rna.

as substrate for mutagenesis we used the coding region of 72h which exhibited optimal binding to the 5e rna . standard molecular biology techniques, including pcr, ligation of annealed synthetic oligonucleotides, and engineered restriction sites were employed to generate plasmids which encoded the mutated his-tagged proteins. the his-tagged polypeptides were expressed in escherichia coli, purified by adsorption on ni-nta beads, and the eluates were incubated with in vitro transcribed 5e rna. binding was measured by incubating fixed amounts of rna with increasing concentrations of the purified wild-type or mutant polypeptides. the proteins and rnas eluted from the ni-nta magnetic agarose beads were analyzed by sds page followed by staining with coomassie blue and ethidium bromide . the results shown in figure  <dig> demonstrated that all polypeptides bound to the magnetic beads because of the functional his-tag. no binding of rna to the beads occurred at the lowest polypeptide concentrations used. depending on the nature of the mutations, some peptides associated with the 5e rna while others were unable to form complexes.

two of the seven constructs with di-alanine changes in the c-terminal region, including the mutant polypeptides with changes of 577-wl- <dig> and 583-rs- <dig> in the pfam motif, were inactive. diminished binding to the 5e rna was observed with alterations of 579-pm- <dig>  and 581-re- <dig> . interestingly, the mutation of the evolutionary conserved p <dig> within pdpxrwlpxxer to an alanine substantially reduced the binding activity . at the same time, the mutation at the variable m <dig> allowed the formation of complexes at wild-type levels .

the alanine changes at 585-yy- <dig> caused a significant reduction  in the ability to form complexes. similarly, the deletion of seven amino acid residues, including 585-yy- <dig> and s <dig>  in 72l yielded inactive polypeptides. together with the dissimilar rna binding activities of 72f and 72g  these results suggested an importance of y <dig> for rna binding. examination of the srp <dig> alignment showed that this tyrosine was only moderately preserved but changed conservatively to another aromatic residue most frequently a phenylalanine. changes of 587-rg- <dig> and 589-rk- <dig> elicited formation of complexes near the levels observed with wild-type 72h . these results were consistent not only with the finding that 72f was able to bind to the rna but also with results obtained previously using proteolytically digested srp <dig> fragments  <cit> .

when changing or deleting two residues near the center of the cluster of lysine residues, the ability to form complexes was significantly reduced . changing or removing six lysine residues abolished binding completely. these data suggested that the lysine-rich region contributed substantially to the rna binding activity of srp <dig> 

chymotryptic accessibility of the srp <dig> rna binding domain
chymotrypsin was shown to preferentially cleave peptides at trptophane, tyrosine and phenyalanine residues  <cit> . this presented an opportunity to probe the structure of the minimal srp <dig> rna binding region and the accessibilities of y <dig>  w <dig>  and 585-yy- <dig>  polypeptides  <dig> j and  <dig> k were treated with a fixed amount of chymotrypsin for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> minutes as described in methods and the proteolytic fragments were analyzed by sds page . cleavages occurred only at the tyrosines  <dig> and  <dig> as indicated by the observed molecular masses of two chymotryptic fragments. consistent with this claim, the 72l polypeptide which lacked these tyrosine residue was not digested . as predicted, the his-tagged 585/ <dig> polypeptide, generated by a 10-minute chymotryptic digestion of 72k, was retained on ni-nta magnetic agarose beads . the data showed that under the conditions used, the amino acid residues y <dig> and w <dig> were protected from cleavage by chymotrypsin and suggested that the rna binding region was a well-folded domain in which these residues were buried inside the structure. previously, when extended digestion times were used and polypeptides had been isolated under harsher conditions, a secondary chymotryptic cleavage was observed at y <dig>  the products of this digestion were unable to form a complex with the srp rna  <cit>  thereby supporting the idea that the  <dig> to 586-region of srp <dig> formed a tightly folded domain which, upon destructive cleavage near its center, lost the capacity to bind rna.

we investigated whether different chymotryptic digestion patterns could be observed when the rna binding domain of srp <dig> formed a complex. increasing amounts of  <dig> j polypeptide was incubated with a fixed amount of the human Δ <dig>  <cit>  or the 5e rna and formation of complexes was monitored in electrophoretic mobility shift assays . quantitative analysis of the binding reaction  resulted in an apparent affinity within the previously observed range  <cit> . treatment of complexes between 72j and the Δ <dig> rna with chymotrypsin showed that the 585-yy- <dig> site remained accessible whereas y <dig> and w <dig> remained protected as had been observed in the free polypeptide. spurious amount of undigested 72j were observed  only at an excess of the Δ <dig> rna . these data suggested that larger conformational changes in the srp <dig> rna binding domain were unlikely to occur in the complex, and at least one of the two tyrosine at 585-yy- <dig> residues  remained accessible when compared to the free polypeptide.

the 5e motif is the site of an rna kink turn
the 5e motif was discovered in an alignment of the srp rnas as one of four conserved elements  <cit> . it has remained the least characterized srp feature. enzymatic probing revealed that 5e and its surrounding region was remarkably resistant towards digestions by several single-strand specific rnases and also the double-strand specific rnase v <dig>  in particular, the 240-auc- <dig> "loop"  was cleaved at unexpectedly low levels suggesting that the 5e rna formed a peculiar compact rnase resistant structure  <cit> .

to investigate the possibility of a structural contortion of the 5e rna motif we adapted a previously developed strategy for the study of dna bending  <cit> . the potential kinking of the 5e region was monitored by comparing the electrophoretic mobilities of larger double stranded nucleic acid fragments with the 5e rna placed either at the center or towards one of the ends. because a bent or kinked molecule was expected to migrate more slowly in gel electrophoresis compared with a linear fragment of the same size, a mobility difference indicated a deviation from a straight linear molecule  <cit> .

using synthetic dna and rna oligonucleotides we generated three different assemblies with 10-nucleotide staggered complementary overhangs . in the first, the 5e motif was placed in the center. the second assembly also contained rna at its center but residues 240-auc- <dig> were lacking. the 5e rna motif was placed near the end in assembly  <dig>  the step-wise annealed nucleic acids were separated by electrophoresis on eight percent native polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with ethidium bromide as described in methods. assembly  <dig> was composed of  <dig> base pairs and migrated approximately as one would expect for a linear straight double-stranded nucleic acid . in contrast, assembly  <dig> with the 5e motif at the center travelled considerably slower near the mobility of a  <dig> base pair double-stranded dna . assembly  <dig> with 5e positioned near the end migrated only slightly slower  than the straight nucleic acid . we concluded that the 5e motif contorted or kinked the rna by a significant degree, consistent with data showing that this section of the srp rna was digested neither by single-strand nor double-strand specific rnases  <cit> .

k-turns, a widespread feature of many medium size and large rna molecules, have been characterized as being composed of a canonical stem, three unpaired nucleotides, and two adjacent non-canonical ga pairs  <cit> . within the 5e motif of the human srp rna, the non-canonical gas were replaced with a conserved g109-c <dig> and a variable u110-g <dig> , but in all other aspects there were striking similarities between 5e and a generic k-turn. homology modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the 5e section of the human srp rna using for comparison the kt- <dig> crystal structure from the  <dig> s rrna of the haloarcula marismortui ribosome  <cit>  yielded a convincing model lacking atomic clashes . as in kt- <dig>  the juxtaposed g109-c <dig> and u110-g <dig> were non-canonical. of particular significance of the 5e model was that the highly conserved a <dig> residue shown previously to be the key residue for the binding of srp <dig>  <cit>  protruded away from the kink. as demonstrated in figure 5b, the 5e k-turn was stable in a buffer containing  <dig> mm edta as a chelator of divalent cations, but also existed when the edta was replaced with  <dig> mm magnesium chloride during fragment assembly and electrophoresis .

a three-dimensional model of human srp <dig> and its rna binding domain
the three-dimensional structure of srp <dig> has not been determined experimentally. we therefore used homology modeling of the whole protein and its rna binding domain in order to gain insights into the mechanism of the binding of rna by srp <dig>  the initial srp <dig> model was created using the i-tasser server  <cit>  followed by necessary adjustments to the structure as described in methods. the final structural model  was consistent with our experimental observations and, at least in part, validated our model. particularly, the tpr motifs located in the n-terminal region of srp <dig> which participated in the formation of a tight complex with srp <dig> were predicted correctly  <cit> . residues  <dig> to  <dig>  shown as a surface representation in figure 6a, contained the rna binding region near the c-terminus of srp <dig> as determined by previously published work  <cit>  and the presented data.

the structure of the rna binding region was predicted to contain two crossed alpha-helices separated by a large loop formed by residues r <dig> to p <dig> . this loop was engaged in maintaining the identified minimal rna binding domain  shown as surface representation in figures 6b and 6c. four residues from the lysine cluster were part of alpha-helix  <dig>  but the other lysine residues  were located within the loop and exposed. the pdpxrwlpxxer pfam motif was entirely contained within the second predicted alpha-helix. the space between the loop and helix  <dig> formed a groove or pocket suitable for binding to the kinked 5e rna. we speculated that the protuberant a <dig> residue of 5e engaged within this groove, and predicted that binding was stabilized by residues from the lysine cluster as well as by certain residues of pdpxrwlpxxer. the model suggested that r <dig> which protruded from the alpha-helix had such a role. in contrast, the chymotryptically inaccessible w <dig> appeared to be essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the domain. sequence based   <cit>  and structure based   <cit>  searches with the srp <dig> rna binding domain did not reveal any structural homologues with appreciable similarity. however, an overall similar mode for engaging an rna k-turn using two regions which embrace the rna existed in the l30e kink-turn rna-protein complex  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we presented a model of the rna binding domain of human srp <dig>  the results obtained from site-directed mutagenesis and proteolytic digestion experiments were entirely consistent with the predicted structure. we proposed and supported experimentally the idea that the 5e rna motif formed a stable k-turn which lacked non-canonical g-a pairs and existed independently of divalent cations. all eukaryotic srp rnas were likely to use the protruding highly conserved adenosine of the 5e rna for insertion into a groove or pocket of srp <dig>  sequence comparisons indicated that the lysine residues of the human srp <dig> were replaced in other organisms with arginines in order to neutralize the negative charges of the rna. most likely because of its dual function in binding to the rna and also to maintain structure, the pdpxrwlpxxer pfam motif was strictly conserved.

because even the free rna was kinked, srp <dig> may not be required to stabilize the contorted rna, but the srp <dig> might still alter the bending angle of the rna.

an approximately  <dig> degree angle was observed by cryo-electron microscopy in the canine srp when it was bound to wheat germ ribosomes  <cit> . the bend or hinge was thought to involve an internal loop at the nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig> , but this region of the srp rna was poorly defined in previous srp models. our data suggested that the 5e motif and not necessarily the neighboring internal loop were responsible for the bent shape of the srp. these data would also explain the conservation of the 5e motif in the archaea srps where srp <dig> and srp <dig> are absent but the large and small srp domains are presumably still required to communicate. further studies will be needed to determine the molecular structure and potential dynamics of the hinge and the precise contribution of the 5e motif to the bent srp.
