BACKGROUND
haptoglobin  is an acute phase protein synthesized by the liver, and its serum concentrations are elevated during inflammation. several functions have been attributed to this protein including its ability to bind free hemoglobin, thus preventing oxidative damage, and its capacity to induce angiogenesis  <cit> . hp is also expressed by murine and human white adipose tissue  and, as reported previously, its expression is induced in obesity  <cit> . according to fain et al.  <cit> , hp is released both by human isolated adipocytes and the adipose tissue matrix, but not by cells of the stromal vascular fraction . this result is in agreement with the observation of do nascimento et al.  <cit> , who showed that in murine adipose tissue hp is one of those few inflammatory molecules specifically produced by adipocytes and not present in the svf. taken together, these data point to hp as a novel adipokine as well as a further molecule marking the intersection between obesity and inflammation.

indeed, the most recent theories  <cit>  describe obesity as a low chronic inflammatory state, and this has been implicated in the development of common medically important complications, including atherosclerosis, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance  <cit> . markers of the obesity-induced inflammatory state are the augmented production by adipose tissue, liver and muscle of proinflammatory proteins such as hp, procoagulant factors, cytokines and chemokines. it is also known that obesity is associated with increased infiltration of macrophages in the wat, but not in liver and muscle  <cit> . this accumulation of monocytes/macrophages certainly contributes to the inflammatory-like gene expression pattern displayed by the adipose tissue of the obese, and strong evidence suggests a causal role for macrophages in the onset of insulin resistance in mice  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying macrophage recruitment are still a matter of investigation, and likely involve increased secretion of chemotactic molecules by the adipocytes. a critical role as a modulator of the influx of monocytes in wat has been established for the couple ligand/receptor monocyte chemoattractant protein  <dig>  receptor  <dig>  ligand or chemokine  ligand  <dig> )  <cit> .

in an effort to further elucidate the biological significance of hp's presence in the wat and of its upregulation in obesity we formulated the hypothesis that hp may serve as a macrophage chemoattractant. we addressed the present issue in vitro by assessing the capacity of hp to attract monocytes . our results provide convincing evidence that the starting hypothesis is correct. further, they suggest that the capacity of hp to induce macrophage migration is at least partly mediated by its interaction with a chemokine receptor and by the activation of a mitogen-activated protein  kinase  pathway.

RESULTS
haptoglobin chemotaxis studies
to our knowledge hp chemotactic activity has never been previously reported. to assess the capacity of this glycoprotein to attract monocytes/macrophages we performed chemotaxis assays with an established cell line of human monocytes  and with primary monocytes isolated from healthy donors. for both cell types hp induced a dose-dependent and positive effect on monocyte migration, as shown in the representative curves of figure 1a, b. mcp <dig> was used as a positive control. we obtained similar results in five additional experiments, which overall indicated a significant effect of hp on monocyte migration starting from concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml . this is indicated as an approximate concentration, since in most cases we employed a purchased mixture of the three major human hp phenotypes, namely 1- <dig>  2- <dig> and 2- <dig> and a precise calculation cannot be performed. for this reason doses employed will be indicated herein with weight/volume measurement units. hp circulates in human plasma at concentrations ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> mg/ml   <cit>  and doses employed throughout the study are within this range or lower. mcp <dig> was used at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml , known to induce maximal chemotactic response as reported in the literature  <cit>  and directly assessed in our laboratory . the use of hp in the ng range with human cells would be of scarce physiological significance, given the much higher doses of the protein to which human tissues are normally exposed. to control for possible aspecific effects due to the high amount of the protein employed in case of hp, experiments were always performed employing similarly high doses of a neutral agent ) as negative control. bsa did not show chemotactic effects at doses as high as  <dig> mg/ml . results totally overlapping with those shown for u <dig> undifferentiated monocytes were obtained when u <dig> cells were induced to differentiate to macrophages .

since in migration assays cells can only move in one direction , the assay must be set up to discriminate between directional and random migration. by following the method established by heit et al.  <cit>  we tested migration across membranes where a chemotactic gradient existed across the membrane , as well as across membranes where a uniform concentration of chemoattractant was present . if the ratio between the number of cells migrating in the gradient versus the number moving in the uniform concentration  is < <dig> the cells are moving randomly. chemotactic ratios of > <dig> suggest that the cells are undergoing chemotaxis. when u <dig> cells were used we obtained a chemotactic ratio of  <dig>  for hp  and of  <dig>  for mcp <dig> . this enabled us to establish that what we observed was directional chemotaxis and not chemokinesis.

in the experiments presented in this study we used a purchased mixture of the three hp phenotypes, namely 1- <dig>  2- <dig>  and 2- <dig> . to further confirm our results we performed chemotaxis experiments on u <dig> monocytes employing the two hp phenotypes  at higher purity  separately or together as a home-made mixture. data are shown in the bar graphs of figure 1c, d and indicate that:  increasing hp purity  results in a moderate increase in hp chemotactic power as demonstrated by the generally increased number of migrated cells toward the 98% pure preparation , this ruling out the possibility that copurified contaminants  other than hp itself may be responsible for the observed cell migration;  the two isoforms slightly differ in that 2- <dig> at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml concentration shows a moderately albeit significantly higher chemotactic potential . differences between the use of the 95% pure and 98% to 100% pure reagents were not considered substantial for the main purpose of this study and the experiments described in the following paragraphs were performed using the 95% recombinant hp.

pre-b lymphocytes stably expressing ccr <dig> are functionally responsive to hp
the results above indicate that hp is able to induce chemotaxis. it is well accepted that monocyte and macrophage migration is principally mediated by chemokine-like factors. indeed, monocytes express abundant levels of active chemokine receptors among which ccr <dig> has been importantly implicated in macrophage chemoattraction  <cit>  to wat, where hp is abundantly expressed and released during obesity. we therefore wanted to evaluate the possibility that hp might interact with this receptor.

to address this issue we first evaluated the chemotactic potential of hp on murine pre-b cell line  <dig>  stably expressing human ccr <dig> receptor , considered a reliable model to test the specific ccr <dig> response  <cit> . cells transfected with ccr <dig> migrated towards mcp <dig> as expected and also positively responded to hp.  <dig> -ccr <dig> cells did not show any significant migration towards the negative control . parental cells were neither responsive to mcp <dig> nor to hp .

as calcium flux is one of the most reliable indicators of signaling through chemokine receptors  <cit> , we also evaluated intracellular calcium release in  <dig> -ccr <dig> cells upon mcp <dig>  and hp  stimulation. hp induced an increase of intracellular free calcium in cells preloaded with fura- <dig> acetoxymethyl ester : the amplitude of the signal was approximately 40% of that assessed for mcp <dig> . after  <dig> -ccr <dig> cells treatment with the specific ccr <dig> antagonist rs <dig>  cells showed a significant decreased responsiveness  to mcp <dig>  while hp-induced calcium flux was totally abolished . hp did not induce any significant calcium flux in parental cells or mcp <dig> 

these data indicate that hp induces functional responses in pre-b lymphocytes stably expressing ccr <dig> 

hp-mediated functional response in monocytes is reduced by ccr <dig> agonist or antagonist
we next wanted to investigate the interaction between hp and ccr <dig> by analyzing the extent to which hp interferes with the specific ccr <dig> ligand mcp <dig> in monocytes. we performed chemotaxis assays with u <dig> human monocytes pretreated for  <dig> min either with mcp <dig> , the ccr2-specific ligand, hp  or bsa , herein used as a neutral agent. pretreatment with mcp <dig> resulted in a complete 100% reduction of cells migrated towards mcp <dig> and an approximate 76% reduction of cells migrated towards hp. by contrast, pretreatment with hp completely abolished migration towards hp itself and caused a 45% reduction in the capacity of u <dig> cells to migrate towards mcp <dig> . when higher doses of hp were employed  for pretreatment, the effect was further magnified with a 91% reduction in the capacity of u <dig> cells to migrate towards mcp <dig>  experiments performed on primary monocytes gave similar results in that pretreatment with mcp <dig> resulted in a 82% reduction of cells migrated towards mcp <dig> and 40% reduction of cells migrated towards hp, whereas hp pretreatment caused a  <dig> % reduction of cells migrated towards mcp <dig> and 79% reduction of cells migrated towards itself. mcp <dig> and hp are then reciprocally capable of interfering with each other in their capacity to attract cells, which is consistent with an interaction with a common receptor.

when u <dig> cells were incubated for  <dig> min with the ccr2-specific antagonist rs <dig> , cell responsiveness to mcp <dig> was reduced by 100%  and a significant reduction of  <dig> % was observed in the capacity of cells to migrate towards hp  . after pretreatment with rs <dig>  human primary monocyte migration towards mcp <dig> and hp was also significantly reduced: cells preserved only 46% and 76%, respectively, of their responsiveness to mcp <dig> and hp . blocking ccr <dig> therefore has a negative effect on hp chemotactic activity.

we next evaluated calcium release in u <dig> cells following hp stimulation: in this case, and differently to what was observed in  <dig> -ccr <dig> cells, mcp <dig> and hp stimulation resulted in similar i mobilization . after pretreatment with  <dig> ng/ml mcp <dig>  cells showed a decreased responsiveness  to  <dig>  mg/ml hp, suggesting that mcp <dig> interferes with hp-induced calcium flux. similar results were obtained after pretreatment with the ccr <dig> inhibitor rs <dig> .

taken together, these data suggest that ccr <dig> mediates  the capability of hp to attract monocytes and to induce calcium release.

hp/ccr <dig> physical interaction
to gain further insights into the type of interaction occurring between hp and ccr <dig>  we performed binding studies using u <dig> cells. the curve in figure  <dig> shows that hp is able to displace mcp <dig> binding to u <dig> cells in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition at a hp concentration of  <dig> mg/ml. this suggests that hp interacts with ccr <dig> albeit with a low binding affinity.

hp induces ccr <dig> internalization in monocytes
as with other chemokines with agonistic activity, ccr <dig> activation is followed by internalization  <cit>  and several studies reported ccr <dig> disappearance from cell surface following exposure to mcp <dig>  <cit> .

to further prove the potential interaction between ccr <dig> and hp, we studied the effect of hp on ccr <dig> internalization. mcp <dig>  and hp pretreatments induced a dose-dependent disappearance of ccr <dig> receptor from the surface of u <dig> cells  as assessed by flow cytometric analysis.

a similar, albeit less dramatic effect was observed in primary monocytes . differences in ccr <dig> surface expression could partly account for the less pronounced internalization observed in these cells. indeed, when assessed by flow cytometry primary monocytes displayed on average approximately 50% of the ccr <dig> surface expression found in u <dig> cells .

we next wanted to rule out the possibility that the observed ccr <dig> disappearance from cell surface was due to hp interference with ccr <dig> binding to its antibody. to this end u <dig> cells were treated with  <dig>  mg/ml hp or bsa, fixed, permeabilized and stained. when compared to cells similarly treated with hp but not permeabilized, these samples showed a 50% increase in ccr <dig> expression . this is a further indication that hp induces ccr <dig> internalization.

hp promotes ccr <dig> signaling
the mapk signal transduction pathway is activated in response to the interaction of ccr <dig> with ligand, and whether this pathway is implicated in the cellular events leading to chemotaxis is a subject of debate  <cit> . to search for additional evidence that hp is able to activate ccr <dig> we assessed the phosphorylation state of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ <dig> in u <dig> cells previously starved overnight  and subsequently incubated with hp, with mcp <dig>  or simply stimulated with 10% serum. as shown in the immunoblot and bar graph of figure  <dig> there was a significant induction of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the hp-treated sample , the intensity of the signal being comparable to that observed for the mcp1-treated samples. when cells were treated with the ccr <dig> antagonist rs <dig>  a dramatic decrease in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was observed in the cells treated with hp and with mcp <dig>  but not in those serum stimulated. conversely, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was abolished in all types of treatment  when u <dig>  the selective inhibitor of the erk upstream kinase map-erk kinase   <cit>  was employed.

to further explore the capability of hp to activate the erk1/ <dig> pathway, a chemotaxis assay employing hp and mcp <dig> as chemotactic agents was performed with u <dig> cells previously incubated with u <dig>  the results of this experiment, summarized in the bar graph of figure 8a, indicate that blocking the erk1/ <dig> pathway results in a dramatic reduction  of the capability of hp and mcp <dig> to induce cell migration. totally overlapping results are obtained when primary monocytes are employed .

these data further strengthen the hypothesis that hp interacts with ccr <dig>  since activation of erk1/ <dig> resulting from exposure to hp is drastically reduced upon pretreatment of cells with a specific ccr <dig> antagonist. further, they suggest that an intact erk1/ <dig> pathway is required for monocyte migration towards hp and mcp <dig> to take place.

discussion
the results described herein demonstrate that hp is a novel chemotactic factor and that its capacity to recruit monocytes is mediated  by an interaction with the chemokine receptor ccr <dig>  evidence for this interaction is based on the capacity of hp to induce ccr <dig> internalization, the capacity of hp to bind  ccr <dig> in vitro, hp induced intracellular calcium flux and hp activation of the erk 1/ <dig> pathway. the two latter properties reveal two additional novel roles/functions for hp. these concepts will be extensively discussed in the following paragraphs.

the in vitro evidence reported herein demonstrate that the inflammation/adiposity marker hp possesses chemotactic potential at doses well within its human physiological concentrations or less  <cit> . further, our findings highlight differences in the two hp isoforms 1- <dig> and 2- <dig>  with the latter being a more potent monocyte chemoattractant. this result should be considered in the light of clinical studies on diabetic patients that indicate an association between the presence of the hp 2- <dig> phenotype and a more frequent onset of complications   <cit>  and cardiovascular disease   <cit> . these data are extensively reviewed by nakhoul et al.  <cit>  that, among other hypotheses, points to the greater expression of markers of activation in macrophages of type 2- <dig> , this implying a higher inflammatory status in these patients. our in vitro findings reinforce this concept by attributing a direct effect of the hp phenotype on macrophage recruitment. the higher capacity of type 2- <dig> to recruit macrophages could indeed contribute to enhancing the local inflammatory status, which in turn accelerates the onset of diabetic comorbidities and cvd  <cit> .

the capacity of hp to recruit monocytes/macrophages also has important implications concerning its role in wat, where, as we described, its expression and release are importantly induced during obesity  <cit> . macrophage infiltration in the wat of obese individuals has been attracting growing attention in the recent years, and has been related to the low chronic inflammatory state that often characterizes obesity status. in particular, the onset of insulin resistance is thought to be determined, at least in part, by the release of inflammatory factors produced by macrophages.

an increasing amount of evidence points to factors actively released by wat or released into the extracellular spaces when adipocytes undergo cell death and 'explode'  <cit> . among these factors particular attention has been dedicated to the chemokine mcp <dig>  which is considered a main player in macrophage recruitment into wat  <cit> . convincing evidence of this role is derived from the increased infiltration of macrophages observed in lean mice overexpressing mcp <dig> in wat  <cit>  and, conversely, from the significantly lower content of these cells in obese mice deficient for this factor  <cit>  as compared with controls. however, macrophage content in the wat of the knockout models was not normalized to the levels observed in lean mice, thus implying the presence of other factors in the modulation of this phenomenon: based on the evidence presented herein, hp is certainly a good candidate to be considered one such factor.

the mcp <dig> receptor ccr <dig> is a g protein-coupled receptor that is predominantly expressed on monocytes and it is thought to be the key receptor mediating their influx into tissues in the context of immune-based inflammation  <cit> . recent studies performed in vivo in ccr <dig> knockout  obese animals demonstrated that this role can be extended to the recruitment of monocytes into the adipose tissue of obese subjects  <cit> . our work suggests that this receptor may play this role not only by interacting with its high affinity ligand mcp <dig>  but also by interacting with a lower affinity ligand represented by hp, as reciprocal interference of the two molecules in their capacity to attract monocytes and to induce calcium release indicates.

it has already been proved that chemokines that behave as specific agonists for other chemokine receptors can bind to ccr <dig> acting as agonists or antagonists  <cit> . hp could by itself induce migration of mononuclear phagocytes to sites of inflammation even in the absence of mcp <dig>  it is worth noting that one of the major features of inflammatory chemokines is their inducible expression  <cit> , whereas upregulation of hp is an established chronic condition during obesity. in this context we can see hp as a 'modulator' of monocyte/macrophage chemoattraction via chemokine receptor  <dig> 

an aspect that differentiates hp from mcp <dig> concerns its relative abundance both in plasma, where hp is  <dig> to  <dig> times more concentrated than mcp <dig>   <cit>  and in the wat of a lean individual, where hp is undoubtedly expressed  <cit>  whereas mcp <dig> is almost undetectable  <cit> . these differences should be taken into account when comparing the chemotactic potency of these molecules in vitro: if doses in the ng range , such as those required for mcp <dig>  were sufficient for hp to recruit macrophages, this would result in a very aspecific and potentially harmful effect, taking place in several areas of the body. consequently, it is conceivable that hp chemotactic action is associated with the high protein concentrations determined by accumulation of the protein in the wat of obese individuals.

tissue distribution also differentiates mcp <dig> from hp. mcp <dig> abundance in wat is prevalently due  to its expression in the svf  <cit>  and a recent study by chung et al.,  <cit>  indicates that mcp <dig>  along with a number of chemokines and cytokines, is also abundantly expressed in preadipocytes, which play a major role in the inflammatory state of the adipose tissue. notwithstanding the relevance of mcp <dig> in macrophage recruitment in wat, the findings reported above suggest that the mcp <dig> increase observed in obesity is derived from a number of cell types, including macrophages. as findings by do nascimento et al. clearly indicate  <cit> , hp gene expression and release are instead almost totally confined to the adipocyte fraction of wat. further, our unpublished observations and a proteomic analysis carried out on different stages of adipose conversion revealed that hp gene expression is linked to the acquisition of the mature adipocyte phenotype  <cit> . therefore hp is one of those few inflammatory molecules specifically expressed by adipocytes within wat. in summary, these observations suggest that hp plays a role in monocyte/macrophage recruitment to wat in conditions slightly different than those typical of mcp <dig>  those conditions could be part of the switch that, according to lumeng et al. takes place in the wat during obesity  <cit>  when alternatively activated macrophages, producing anti-inflammatory molecules, are replaced by classically activated macrophages producing inflammatory molecules.

we can therefore speculate that hp participates mainly in the first part of the process, when adipocytes undergoing the initial effects of weight gain, start producing an increased concentration of molecules, including hp, that activate the recruitment of other ccr2+ monocytes or that, likely, induce changes in the expression profile of the resident macrophages, which in turn recruit other monocytes . our hypothesis of hp as a modulator for monocyte/macrophage attraction to wat does not underestimate the major role played by mcp <dig> or the other chemokines binding ccr <dig>  in fact, we cannot exclude the possibility that hp-induced functional responses observed in monocytes are not exclusively due to hp/ccr <dig> interaction, but are also due to the action of the glycoprotein on other chemokine receptors. in this regard it is interesting to observe the different potency shown by hp in inducing calcium release in lymphocytes stably expressing ccr <dig> and in monocytes. if for the former the hp-induced i signal is less than half of that induced by mcp <dig>  in the case of monocytes calcium mobilization is equally induced by the two factors. this may suggest the existence of hp-responsive receptors, other than ccr <dig>  expressed by monocytes and not by pre-b lymphocytes.

this study also demonstrates for the first time that hp is able to induce calcium release and to activate erk1/ <dig> map kinase. this introduces remarkable additions to the functions and properties classically attributed to hp. as a matter of fact this glycoprotein, so far considered a player in actions mostly occurring in the extracellular environment , seems to be capable of interfering with the cascade of events activated by calcium signaling among which an intracellular pathway playing a pivotal role in several physiological and pathological conditions. indeed, cytosolic alterations of calcium ion concentrations are an integral part of signal transduction  <cit>  and reported evidence indicates that in monocytes calcium is a determinant second messenger in the induction of the inflammatory response orchestrated by nuclear factor κb  <cit> . this implies that the elevated hp levels observed in the wat of obese subjects  <cit>  may be relevant in determining an increase in the production of inflammatory molecules  in resident or in newly recruited monocytes.

the role of mapk pathways in monocytes migration has been previously investigated. as reported by ashida and collaborators  <cit>  in the established thp <dig> cell line of monocytes, erk1/ <dig> is responsible for integrin activation but not for chemotaxis, which is under the control of rho kinase and p <dig> mapk. conversely, according to our data on u <dig> cells erk1/ <dig> is indeed implicated both in mcp1-dependent and hp-dependent chemotaxis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates for the first time that hp is able to recruit monocytes  by interacting with the chemokine receptor ccr <dig>  this discloses a novel function for this molecule, which is upregulated in the wat of obese subjects and which could participate to the massive infiltration of monocytes observed in obesity. further, we have shown that by pharmacologically inhibiting ccr <dig> we could block cell migration to hp, further strengthening the notion that drugs for the obesity-induced inflammatory state could be developed by acting on this receptor. in this regard pharmacological inhibition of the erk1/ <dig> ccr <dig> downstream pathway should also be considered as a possible therapeutical intervention to prevent macrophage infiltration into wat.
