BACKGROUND
the modern dog breeds are a result of vigorous line-breeding and often originate from a few founding ancestors. this has led to extreme phenotypic variation between breeds, but limited genetic variation within breeds  <cit> . some breeds have a considerably higher susceptibility to certain diseases than others. this indicates an enrichment of risk alleles within these specific breeds. canine cancer is an example of such a disease. mammary tumours are among the most common canine cancer forms  <cit> . elderly, intact bitches are primarily affected by these tumours  <cit> , with a higher incidence in breeds such as the english springer spaniel, boxer, cocker spaniel and dachshund  <cit> . the differences in breed predisposition clearly indicate a genetic influence on canine mammary tumour  development. there are many similarities between cmts and human breast cancer. among the shared disease characteristics are a spontaneous occurrence of tumours, by which females are primarily affected, and a hormonal influence on tumour development  . regional lymph node metastasis seems to be less important as a prognostic factor in dogs than in humans, but metastatic spread is otherwise broadly equal  <cit> . there are also similarities regarding the histological features and classifications of human breast cancer and cmts. but while epithelial tumours are by far the most common in humans, cmts relatively frequently also contain myoepithelial and mesenchymal components. furthermore studies indicate that cmt and human breast cancer have several mutual prognostic markers and genetic risk factors for disease . still, the underlying inherited risk factors for cmts are largely unknown. previous studies of genotypes, gene and protein expression in cmts have identified possible candidate genes and pathways, but the results need to be confirmed or are somewhat inconsistent. however, a study on brca <dig> and brca <dig>  two genes well-known to be involved in human breast cancer, showed associations of these genes with mammary tumours in english springer spaniels  <cit> . another cmt study found mutations in the cancer-associated gene tp <dig> <cit> . we have previously identified a considerable number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in ten cancer-associated genes known from studies in dogs and/or humans  <cit> . some of these snps are likely to be associated with canine cancer, and the protein-changing snps are of particular interest due to their potential as functional disease-causing variants. in the present study, we aimed at exploring such cmt associations to identify genes involved in the development of mammary tumours in a case-control population of english springer spaniels  and in a second dataset of high and low risk breeds of cmt.

RESULTS
after quality control,  <dig> ess cases and  <dig> controls were left for analysis . of the  <dig> snps that passed quality control in the ess case-control dataset, nominal single snp association was found for two snps in esr <dig> exon  <dig>  and intron 7– <dig>  . another snp in esr <dig>  showed borderline nominal significance . the risk alleles for the two snps ss <dig> and ss <dig> are extremely common in the ess cohort . the ss <dig> and rs <dig> snps were still significant after correcting for multiple testing using  <dig>  permutations . ss <dig> also remained significant after applying bonferroni correction. of the classified cases,  <dig> malignant and  <dig> benign were left after quality control . in the comparison of cases with malignant diagnosis vs. controls, ss <dig> showed nominal significance , but the result was not significant after multiple testing correction. we found no significant differences in allele frequencies between benign cases and controls or malignant and benign cases. all association results are provided in additional file  <dig>

we identified  <dig> ld blocks with d’ ~  <dig> and lod ≥  <dig> in the ess case-control dataset. one ld block was identified in each of the genes brca <dig>  brip <dig>  cdh <dig>  chek <dig>  egfr and pten, whereas two and three blocks were found within esr <dig> and erbb <dig> , respectively. only one snp was genotyped in brca <dig> and stk <dig>  making ld and haplotype analysis impossible. nominal association was found for one and two haplotypes in each of two esr <dig> ld blocks, respectively, and one haplotype showed borderline nominal significance . no haplotypes remained significant after correction for multiple testing. as the total cancer risk of an individual is probably a result of risk alleles at multiple loci, we evaluated the combined effect of the risk haplotypes of the two esr <dig> ld blocks compared to the protective haplotypes. a borderline bonferroni-significant association was found for the combined risk haplotypes with an odds ratio of  <dig>   .

e or could not be calculated as the minor allele was absent in either cases or controls.

however, there were considerable inter-breed variations in snp allele frequencies for the high and low risk dataset also within the high and low risk breed groups . thus, the mean allele frequency of the group was often not representative for all the breeds included. the overall differences in allele frequency among breeds also caused general inflation of association p-values, complicating the interpretation. breed permutation testing was therefore performed to correct for the inflation. none of the snps were significant after breed permutation testing .

to estimate the degree of association seen for the bonferroni significant polymorphisms, correlation between disease risk and average breed allele frequency for each snp was calculated. no statistically significant correlations were found.

we applied the ld block criteria d’ ~  <dig> and lod ≥  <dig> to the second dataset to study if any of the blocks found in the ess cases and controls could be re-identified in the high and low risk breeds. not all blocks were present in all breeds, but a 9kilobase block of eight snps in erbb <dig>  was re-identified for all breeds but the beagle.

when aligned in sequencher® the canine esr <dig> exons showed a high match percentage  to the human exons, except for exon  <dig> and  <dig>  we found no human cancer-associated polymorphisms in close proximity to the canine esr <dig> exon  <dig> snp . however, the canine snp in exon  <dig>  was positioned one base pair  next to the human rs <dig> snp . another human esr <dig> polymorphism, rs <dig>  aligned to the canine exon  <dig> at a position 207 bp downstream from the canine exon  <dig> snp   . the canine snps rs <dig> and ss <dig> were synonymous, while ss <dig> lead to an amino acid substitution from isoleucine to leucine. also, ss <dig> is located in a gene region conserved across four species  <cit> . however, the substitution was predicted benign and tolerant by polyphen and sift, respectively  <cit> .

discussion
publications about the existence, frequency and importance of cmt-associated germline mutations and their role in the tumour development are sparse. in the present survey, we studied snps in known cancer-associated genes and observed significant differences in allele and haplotype frequencies for the esr <dig> gene in the ess material. these findings were supported by the high and low risk breed groups and suggested an association of esr <dig> alleles with increased risk of cmts. the esr <dig> gene encodes an estrogen receptor which works as a ligand-activated transcription factor in the cell. besides its normal role in e.g. sexual development and reproductive function, the estrogen receptor is involved in several pathological processes such as breast cancer . previous studies on human breast cancer have suggested that esr <dig> polymorphisms are associated with the development of these tumours . the non-synonymous canine exon  <dig> snp  is positioned one bp downstream compared to the position of the human rs <dig> snp. while rs <dig> is in human codon  <dig>  the canine snp aligned to a position in human codon  <dig>  both codons encode amino acids in the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor . this domain is related to receptor dimerization, chaperone binding and recruitment of co-regulators  <cit> . studies on rs <dig> have shown an association with breast malignancies  <cit> . its c allele has been associated with cancer, suggesting that it interferes with the binding of the gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> transcription factors to the estrogen receptor  <cit> . gata transcription factors interact with the activation factor  <dig>  region of the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor  <cit> . there are structural differences in the human and canine erα proteins, but the major pocket sites seem to be very similar  <cit> . an association with breast cancer has also been suggested for the human rs <dig> <cit> , which aligned in proximity of the synonymous canine exon  <dig> snp . rs <dig> is positioned near the f domain of the human estrogen receptor . this domain is believed to be important for the ability of estrogen receptor to distinguish between receptor agonist and antagonist binding  <cit> . thus, the observed associations of the canine exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> snps in our two independent canine datasets are supported by similar effects of closely linked snps in the human gene. this suggests esr <dig> as an interesting candidate gene for mammary tumours in dogs as well. given the prior evidence that esr <dig> plays a role in human breast cancer etiology, it seems probable that the described loci of the present study might be correlated with a causal variant affecting esr <dig> function.

correction for multiple testing is necessary to adjust for the multiple comparisons performed when testing several snps or haplotypes for association. however, snps within a gene are very closely linked and not independent observations. correcting for the number of snps would therefore be too conservative. moreover, this study comprises a selection of biologically important and previously cancer-associated genes where it is likely to find an association, rather than a random set of genes. to assure an appropriate correction for multiple testing of the single snp and haplotype p-values, we therefore used the number of ld blocks. the fact that only one snp in esr <dig> was significant in the ess material after bonferroni correction was somewhat surprising. possibly, the rest of the snps we assessed are not directly causative or in high ld with such variants, creating false negative gene association results. further, a substantial number of sub-classifications of cmts exists  <cit> , potentially with different germline mutations contributing to the development of different tumour subtypes and grades of malignancy. such heterogeneity might complicate the detection of truly cancer-associated mutations. thus, our study of the ess dataset might have insufficient power to prove snp associations to cmt. still, it has been indicated that about  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls should suffice to find loci with strong effects  even for complex traits such as cancer  <cit> . as the one bonferroni significant esr <dig> snp  is intronic, and we have tested only a limited set of snps, this snp is more likely in ld with a functional mutation than being causative itself. it might also be a false positive. thus, more studies on the esr <dig> gene are required to establish its role in cmt development.

the considerable breed variations in allele frequencies for the high and low risk dataset might be expected due to between-breed genetic heterogeneity for risk alleles at different risk loci. yet, the differences are interesting as it appears to be a significant breed-specific accumulation of certain coding variants also in genes that are vital for normal cell function. however, the large allele frequency differences between breeds within the same risk group complicated the interpretation of the results. there is potentially a genetic heterogeneity between breeds as to predominant cmt types and associated risk genes/alleles. if the candidate genes in this study are associated with cancer risk in the selected breeds, the variation in allele frequencies indicates that the associated genes/alleles differ between breeds. another possibility is that cancer-driving mutations are in the regulatory parts of the genes, and the coding snps in the present study can be considered markers for functionally active regulatory sites. during breed differentiation there may have been recombinations between regulatory sites and coding parts resulting in different coding snps being linked to regulatory variation in different breeds. consequently, even if a gene has an important role in cancer development, the associated coding snp allele/haplotype might vary between breeds. another challenge is the documentation of high and low risk breeds. as a result of e.g. ancestral patterns of geographical establishment, fluctuations in a dog breed’s popularity and extensive use of popular sires within a country, the genetic composition of a dog breed can change over time and between different geographical locations. thus, breed predisposition of cmt might vary from subpopulation to subpopulation. we based the selection of high and low risk breeds in this study on previous publications, but not all of them were norwegian, and some were up to twenty years old. this could possibly be a source of sample error in our study. moreover, the dogs from the high and low risk breeds in our study are randomly selected without knowledge about the cmt phenotype. they would be a mixture of individuals with high and low risk corresponding to the population frequency of cmt. the frequency and effect of cmt-associated risk alleles would need to be relatively strong to be detected in such a material. it might be that our study is underpowered in that respect. however, we have documented large breed variations in allele frequencies of the coding snps in important cancer genes, and there are probably similar differences in the frequency of functionally active haplotypes between dog populations.

CONCLUSIONS
cancer is a very complex disease. as in human breast malignancies, it is likely that the development of cmts is influenced by several genes. the identified association of esr <dig> to cmt in the present survey supports the power of the canine model for human breast cancer and the fact that combined studies within and between breeds can add power to the detection of risk alleles also for complex traits. however, the increased risk of cmts in ess and other high risk breeds might be due to other snps and/or genes than those selected in the present study. there is also a chance that predisposing cmt variants are undetected in our study due to limited power. nevertheless, this is to our knowledge the first reported association of esr <dig> polymorphisms to cmt and supports esr <dig> as a candidate gene for canine cancer that should be further studied.
