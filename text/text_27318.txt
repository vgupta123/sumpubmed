BACKGROUND
linking a causal mutation to a phenotype by genetic mapping is one of the major tools for uncovering gene function. however, classical ‘positional gene cloning’ by forward genetics and ‘genetic walking’ has been very time-consuming  <cit> . since more than 25 years, molecular markers have been used to detect allele frequencies in pools of phenotypically similar genotypes from segregating populations, thus linking position information from genetic markers to loci contributing to specific traits  <cit> . this method, called ‘bulk segregant analysis’ , relies on the application of molecular markers which detect dna polymorphisms between the parents of a mapping population that are closely linked to a locus relevant for a particular trait. such markers will co-segregate with that trait, i.e. segregate together with the respective phenotype. while qtl analysis with mapping populations is usually the more precise method to identify genes controlling a trait, pooling and bsa has the advantage of avoiding the necessity to genotype every member of the population  <cit> . with regard to the genetic and/or genomic resolution, or the size of the genomic region to be identified, bsa and genetic mapping in general depend on the number of recombination events evaluated. in addition, mapping can only be as precise as the number of available markers allows. with the advent of next generation sequencing , this drawback has fallen away almost completely  <cit> . also, the number of genomes sequenced and assembled has increased considerably over the last years  <cit> , and elaborate tools for variant calling from whole genome shotgun sequencing datasets have become available. together, and given that sequence variation as such exists, this has allowed tremendous progress in linking genotype to phenotype as well as in uncovering gene functions by forward genetics.

by combining bsa with ngs, the process of identifying causal genes for monogenic traits or phenotypes has been accelerated dramatically  <cit> . data from ngs allow reliable detection of allelic variation in the form of single sequence polymorphisms  and small insertions and deletions , as well as the determination of the relative abundance of these alleles. phenotypic selection of individuals from a segregating f <dig> population affects the allele frequency at loci linked to the phenotype. the skews introduced by this targeted selection can be revealed by genome-wide evaluation of allele frequencies in pools of individuals that were built separately for the different phenotypes of the same trait. genomic regions that showed diverging allele frequencies for the two parental phases can then be analyzed for mutations responsible for the phenotype in question  <cit> .

initially, ngs was applied to bsa for the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the general approach is now referred to as ‘mapping by sequencing’ , while the original bioinformatic analysis pipeline was designated shoremap. once the biological material, a large segregating f <dig> population of a. thaliana, was produced and phenotyped, the mbs approach allowed to map a causal gene to a small genomic region within days. in fact, due to the high density of genetic markers and the availability of reference sequences for both parental genotypes, it was even possible to identify the individual nucleotide sequence aberration that caused the mutant phenotype. the initial proof-of-concept experiment identified a non-synonymous snp in a single gene by sequencing a dna pool derived from  <dig> mutant  f <dig> plants  <cit> .

while the general principle of mbs is fairly straightforward, the bioinformatics to realize reliable identification of the responsible genetic interval or genome region is not. therefore, a number of bioinformatic analysis pipelines that deal with the massive amount of short read data for dna sequence variation detection and allele frequency determination have been developed. by using such pipelines, mbs has been successfully applied in the model species arabidopsis, rice and fruit fly . to allow the basic principle of mbs to work, the two alleles corresponding to the phenotypic difference that is sorted into the pools need to be associated with haplophases that offer sequence variation and thereby traceable molecular markers. to introduce such traceable markers into the f <dig> generation, several crossing schemes have been suggested. these include crossing to an accession that displays a relatively high degree of variation like in the initial proof-of-concept experiment where variation was derived from a cross of col- <dig> x ler- <dig>  in addition, mutagen-induced sequence polymorphisms have been used as markers which allowed to create the f <dig> in essentially the same genetic background . this strategy permitted increased sensitivity for selecting subtle phenotypic differences  <cit> . common to all of these approaches is the necessity to perform a dedicated crossing experiment as a basis for phenotypic selection of f <dig> offspring, as well as the need to sequence the parental genotype in addition to the availability of a reference genome sequence. also, extensions of the strategy have been realized in maize. sequence-based determination of genome-wide allele frequencies was used to assess the effect of selection for ear number in an experimental population pre- and post-selection for  <dig> generations. this resulted in the identification of  <dig> loci contributing to control of number of ears per plant in maize  <cit> . recently, a method designated ‘extreme-phenotype gwas’  was described that relies on measurement of allele frequencies in pools of individuals from a diversity panel that have extreme phenotypes. by using the kernel row number trait as an example, several linked qtl were resolved and trait-associated variants within a single gene under a qtl peak were detected  <cit> .

for all important crop plants, breeders maintain many lines or accessions harboring important traits and phenotypes. these lines are usually phenotypically and genetically well characterized. using pools of such plant lines  for mbs could make, at least for some cases, time consuming crossings to generate segregating f <dig> populations unnecessary. another aspect is that the number of recombination events covered by the pools subjected to bsa or mbs is a main determinant of the resolution of the mapping, or, in other words, the size of the genetic interval that should contain the causal gene  <cit> . because recombination events from several generations are accumulated during the breeding history of plant lines in a breeding panel  <cit> , the accessions from a breeding panel included in a pool contribute more recombination events than f <dig> plants from a single cross. this should shorten the genetic interval and allow to more precisely reveal the position of the causative gene.

sugar beet  is a diploid crop plant with  <dig> chromosomes in the haploid genome and an estimated genome size of about  <dig> mbp  <cit> . a 567 mbp reference sequence  <cit>  with  <dig>  annotated protein-coding genes  <cit>  has recently been published. the taxonomic position of b. vulgaris lies within the amaranthaceae family which belongs to the order caryophyllales. in contrast to species from the asterid and rosid clades, the red, violet and yellow pigments in species of the beta family are derived from the betalain biosynthetic pathway . the capability to produce betalains is unique to some families of the order caryophylalles  <cit> . betalain accumulation in b. vulgaris is controlled by at least two loci, called r and y, which are under investigation since the 1930s  <cit> . r was found to control the red versus yellow shift in beets, whereas the y locus is responsible for pigment versus no pigment in the interior of the beet root  <cit> . y was found to be separated from the r locus by a genetic distance of 7 cm  <cit> . the two loci were identified and molecularly described in  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> , respectively. usually, the r locus contains a dominant allele that conditions a red hypocotyl. since r is assumed to be unlinked to other regions that are under selection during sugar beet breeding, the r locus has also been studied because of its role as a visible marker in crosses. the gene bvcyp76ad <dig> that represents the r locus was referred to as the red gene. it codes for a cytochrome p <dig> enzyme that is required for betalain biosynthesis  <cit> . the characterized mutant allele r contains a 5 bp long insertion in the coding region of the gene leading to a premature stop codon. this loss of function mutation in the recessive allele r results in a lack of betalain accumulation in the hypocotyl, causing a green to yellowish hypocotyl phenotype that is easy to score .fig.  <dig> the phenotype of sugar beet  seedlings homozygous for a mutation in the red gene. betalain deficient plants  do not show any red pigmentation, the hypocotyl appears green due to the lack of betalain pigments. the two phenotypes are easy to distinguish, since homozygous plants show either a fully expressed red color in the hypocotyl, or a complete lack of it. rr and rr, genotype of the respective seedling



using the hypocotyl color trait, we show that mbs can be applied to phenotypic pools from breeding panels to successfully identify a narrow genetic interval that contains a causal gene in the crop b. vulgaris. since the plant lines displaying the contrasting red or green hypocotyl color phenotype were selected from breeding panels, multiple rounds of crossing, recombination and selection were accessed in a convenient way. by selection of homozygous inbred or dh lines we avoided the need to deal with plants that are genotypically heterozygous red/red. the identified genetic interval had a size of  <dig> kbp and contained the known red gene encoding bvcyp76ad <dig> 

RESULTS
the starting point for the experiment to map the r locus of b. vulgaris by mbs was the selection of the plant material. a total of  <dig> different homozygous accessions that had been phenotypically characterized for hypocotyl color  were selected. of these,  <dig> displayed green hypocotyl and were expected to be genetically rr, while the other  <dig> accessions displayed red hypocotyl and were expected to be genetically rr. the accessions were randomly selected from the breeding programs of three sugar beet breeding companies each contributing  <dig> rr  and  <dig> rr  accessions. since it was initially unknown if all three panels really contained the same r allele , dna was extracted for each of the six pools of  <dig> accessions separately. genomic dna of each of the six pools was sequenced with illumina pe technology  with the goal to reach a target coverage of about  <dig> fold, resulting in an overall coverage of about  <dig> fold for both superpools that were created in silico.

after stringent quality filtering the coverage of uniquely mapped reads was close to the planned values . for the visualization and detection of a local skew in the allele frequency, it was crucial to detect the changes in allele frequency of sequence variants. therefore, the read data were mapped to the sequence of pseudo-chromosomes which we derived from the ordered scaffolds of the reference sequence  <cit> . all steps of the data analysis pipeline, from read mapping to variant calling, were implemented to run on a local compute cluster . figure  <dig> depicts the work-flow from sequencing of the pools via data processing to evaluation of variants. due to the sampling of accessions into pools and inherent properties of short-read sequencing methods, like stochasticity in sequencing coverage or random sampling effects for read coverage at a given polymorphic position, the values of the true allele frequencies can only be estimated  <cit> . we used the term allele frequency estimate  to reflect this fact . the final set of identified high quality biallelic variations consisted of  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels. the results of the individual steps to the final set of variations are described in detail below.table  <dig> illumina read data used and coverage of the concatenated refbeet <dig>  reference sequence

theoretically, it is possible that the mutated nucleotide position which cause the r allele to be non-functional are also affected in functionally intact r alleles. this would, since multiallelic nucleotide variations for a single snp or indel were excluded, result in removal of the causal variant from the data. however, we considered this risk very low given the genetic background of the material, and the fact that independent mutations affecting identical positions are very rare. we determined the rate of positions with more than two alleles in our data to be about  <dig>  % for snps. in most of the cases, these multiallelic nucleotide variations might be caused by errors in variant detection.

improvement of indel detection
obviously, not only the relatively easily detected snps but also indels have the potential to be causal for a given trait. in addition, indels are also useful for determination of additional afe values and contribute to an increased marker density. therefore, a correct mapping of reads to regions containing indels was crucial. unfortunately, unprejudiced read mappers including bwa can only map reads correctly that cover both sides, upstream and downstream, of a given indel. reads that either begin or end close to an indel are often mapped incorrectly and can, therefore, contribute wrongly to either of the true allelic options that exist at the studied position. often, the real insertion or deletion thus appears to be less abundant than it truly is. the bioinformatics toolbox gatk  <cit>  offers the tool indelrealign that locally re-aligns reads at indel positions, so that the number of mismatching bases is minimized across all reads spanning a given indel. this tool removes many misalignment artifacts, resulting in significantly improved afe values for indels and also for snps in their immediate vicinity. correct determination of afe values is especially relevant for the detection of the causative indel or snp, because this should, in theory, display an afe of close to the value  <dig>  since the mutation at the r locus had previously been identified as an indel in a somehow repetitive sequence  <cit>  that is even more affected by mismapping, application of the local read realignment tool was obligatory for success of mbs in our case.

improvement of variant calling and variant filtering
to further improve the accuracy of variant calling, gatk’s base quality score recalibration  was applied. bqsr requires a training set that was unavailable for b. vulgaris, and consequently a training set was created. to account for run-specific errors, and because variants may occur only in one pool and with low frequency, a separate training set for each sequencing run was created. this should avoid treatment of diluted variants as errors after merging of the data. after recalibration of the quality scores by bqrs, the sequencing runs were merged into one set of reads. the final variant calling was done with haplotypecaller .

variant calling identified  <dig> , <dig> variations . after filtering according to the “gatk best practice”  to reduce false positive variant calls, as well as exclusion of multiallelic nucleotide variations,  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels were considered as high confidence variations between the combined sequence data from all breeding panels and the b. vulgaris reference sequence. the removal of multiallelic nucleotide variations affected  <dig>  polymorphic positions. for the final comparison of the pools, we could only consider variations for which we had sequence information from both pools. after filtering out variations that were only covered in one of the two superpools, a final set of  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels was obtained.

identification of a  <dig> kbp interval containing the red gene
for easy visual identification of genetic intervals showing deviant af introduced by the phenotypic selection when building the pools, the afe values of all detected variants were plotted along their position on the nine sugar beet pseudo-chromosomes. inspection of the sequence data had shown that all three breeding panels contained reads derived from the published r allele  <cit> . therefore, data from the three breeding panels were combined, and afe values from the ‘red’ and the ‘green’ superpool were analyzed. to emphasize that the most relevant information to be extracted from phenotypic pooling is the separation of alleles into the two pools, delta-afe values were determined. the mean delta-afe is around  <dig>  for each of the nine chromosomes, except for chromosome  <dig>  for which it is  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the result of plotting the absolute values of delta-afe along the genome sequence, represented by concatenated pseudo-chromosomes. inspection of the plot allowed ad-hoc identification of a clear peak of the delta-afe value distribution at the top of chromosome  <dig>  the result of plotting the delta-afe values for an expanded pseudo-chromosome  <dig> only is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> allele frequency estimate  of the red versus the green pool of  <dig> accessions each plotted as delta-afe values. the delta-afe values for all detected variants  were plotted along the concatenated reference sequence sorted according to chromosome number. b. vulgaris chromosome  <dig> shows a clear difference peak close to it’s upper end . since the calculated afe values become less reliable with less coverage, only variants supported by a mapped coverage of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold of the mean coverage of the respective chromosome were included in the plot

fig.  <dig> plot of delta-afe values for chromosome  <dig>  the delta-afe values, indicated by yellow dots, clearly show a skew in the afe values of the two pools. the pink line indicates the ad-hoc identified interval surrounding the peak



a list of all variants with an afe value close to zero in the ‘green’ superpool  was extracted from all afe data. these variant positions were used as starting points for interval detection. this resulted in detection of a single interval on chromosome  <dig> with an exact length of  <dig>  bp, overlapping the central part of the peak visualized by plotting delta-afe values. non of the other chromosomes displayed any variants with afe values close to zero in the “green” superpool, so no further intervals were defined.

with a focus on the interval detected, afe values from the ‘red’ and the ‘green’ superpools were plotted . the distribution shows that variant positions in the interval from the ‘green’ superpool follow the reference sequence, while the variant positions from the ‘red’ superpool show fluctuating afe values. this fits to the expectation because the dh genotype kws <dig> that provided the reference sequence is genetically rr and phenotypically green. the gaps in the variant distribution, i.e. the regions with no afe values plotted in fig.  <dig>  were probably mostly caused by the unique read mapping requirement applied during variant detection, causing no mapping coverage in repetitive, paralogous or duplicated regions.fig.  <dig> plot of afe and delta-afe values for the genetic interval detected. afe values of the variants detected in the identified interval were plotted for the ‘red’ and the ‘green’ superpool, with a red dot on top of a green one if both were at an identical spot. the intron/exon structure of genes  overlapping the interval are depicted at the bottom of the figure. the indel bases present in the sequences of the 'green' pool and absent from the sequences of the 'red' pool are shown in the upper left area. this indel affects the gene bv2_030670_ucyh which is the red gene. note that the accession kws <dig> from which the reference sequence has been derived was green and genotypically rr




identification of the causal gene from three genes in the interval
the interval on chromosome  <dig> of  <dig>  bp in length overlaps three annotated genes, of which one is the published red gene bv2_030670_ucyh. as expected, all afe values from the green superpool were close to zero since this criterion was used for interval detection. however, most afe values from the ‘red’ superpool were ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  thus, the data demonstrated the existence of exactly one ‘green’ haplophase  identical to the reference sequence, but multiple ‘red’ phases or r alleles that contribute individual combinations of variant positions. of all variants within the interval, only one had a delta-afe of  <dig> and was overlapping an exon. this single variant was identical to the causative 5 bp insertion in the gene bv2_030670_ucyh. the insertion was present in all reads from the ‘green’ superpool mapping to the respective variant position, and in the reference sequence resulting in the determination of an afe value of  <dig> . at the same time, the causative 5 bp insertion showed an afe of value  <dig> in the ‘red’ superpool. these results are in full concordance with the previous identification of the red gene  <cit> .

the two other genes, bv2_030680_aogx and bv2_030690_isqu that are also contained within the defined genetic interval would also be candidates if the causal gene would not have been identified already. however, they were less probable candidates compared to bv2_030670_ucyh for the following reasons. first, the cds regions of both of them do not carry variant positions that display delta-afe values close to  <dig> . second, bv2_030690_isqu, which is located at the downstream border of the interval, carries quite some variant positions in its 5′ region that display clearly afe values significantly higher than the expected value of zero. manual inspection of the reads supporting these values of about  <dig>  confirms that these afe’s are real. third, bv2_030680_aogx, although in the middle of the interval, does not overlap with any strongly segregating variations . there were some variants outside annotated genes  that show delta-afe values of  <dig>  but based on the assumption that the green hypocotyl phenotype is caused by a gene affecting pigmentation these positions can be considered less relevant. finally, we analyzed and categorized the effect of sequence variations on the coding regions of the three genes within the interval with snpeff  <cit> . the gene bv2_030670_ucyh was indeed the only gene affected by a variant that most likely has a deleterious effect, indicating that even without knowledge about the causal mutation the gene bv2_030670_ucyh would have been identified as the best candidate.

the number of accessions used has a high influence on mapping resolution
to determine the effect of using either  <dig>  or  <dig>  accessions, the differences in afe values from the two superpools generated with  <dig> individuals were compared to those from one of the pools generated from only two times  <dig> individuals. to select one of the three breeding panels for this experiment, the mean afe value for the combined  pools from the three panels was determined  with the goal to identify the panel with the material that was the least similar to the reference sequence. the two ‘red’ and ‘green’ superpools showed a mean afe value of  <dig> . breeding panel  <dig> displayed a mean afe value of  <dig> , while the two other panels showed mean values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. breeding panel  <dig> also showed the highest number of variants exclusive to one breeding panel, and the smallest overlap with the other breeding panels . during this evaluation, we also noted that more than 80 % of the same biallelic variant positions were detected in all breeding panels.fig.  <dig> overview of common and independent variations in the breeding panels studied. venn diagram of shared and private variations detected by pool sequencing. only variations for which information  was available in all three pools independently were taken into account



the two pools  from breeding panel  <dig> which diverged with a mean afe value of  <dig>  were chosen for further sequencing to reach a coverage comparable to that of the two superpools . variants were called for both pools with  <dig> accessions, and delta-afe values were determined. for comparison to the results from the superpool analyses that was based on two times  <dig> accessions, a sliding window approach was used . the results are summarized in fig.  <dig>  the data showed that using  <dig> accessions per pool was still sufficient to identify the correct genomic region. however, the interval detection procedure also applied to the superpool data now yielded four intervals  that were distributed over almost  <dig> kbp. in total, the genetic interval detected with 2 ×  <dig> accessions was about  <dig> times larger than the interval from full data. also, the reduction of the number of accessions from other breeding panels has strongly increased background noise, also contributing to a much broader peak in the target region. the sharper peak and shorter interval with 2 ×  <dig> accessions were a result of the higher number of recombinations introduced with more accessions.fig.  <dig> delta-afe plot to compare results from pools of  <dig> vs.  <dig> accessions. sliding windows  of delta afe values of detected variants were plotted along chromosome  <dig> from the two different pools studied. colors as indicated



attention should be paid to the fact that it was not necessary to generate a read coverage high enough to capture all individuals in the pools, but only high enough to get a good representation of the distribution of frequent variants within the respective pool. a coverage of about  <dig> fold was sufficient to capture information from  <dig> accessions . since 70-fold coverage is by far not enough to sequence every chromosome in the pool, rare variants that occur in only a few of the accessions are underrepresented in our data set. by increasing the number of accessions these rare variants, that are “private” to a single or a very low number of accessions, get further suppressed. under these conditions, such rare variants were not distinguishable from sequencing errors. this also contributes to a reduction of the variance of afe, lowering what looks like background noise in our approach, and exposing the interval of interest. in other words, the coverage we used introduced an intended bias against rare variants. due to the accumulation of historic recombinations in each accession, the effect of adding more accessions to the pools is stronger than adding more f <dig> individuals from a crossing experiment. thus, our approach yielded a really short interval, probably much shorter than from a mbs approach using a similar number of f <dig> individuals.

about  <dig> fold coverage is sufficient for interval detection
to test the effect of increased coverage on interval detection while keeping the number of accession at 2 ×  <dig>  we applied our method to subsets of the data. nine subsets of the mapped reads of the two superpools were generated, with linearly increasing coverage and an increment of 1/ <dig> of the total coverage . the resulting mapping data were used to call variations. putative intervals were then defined by the algorithm described above.table  <dig> intervals detected for subsets of the superpools with increasing coverage

coverage a

a mean number of uniquely mapped reads covering each base of the reference sequence


b number of intervals identified


c summarized length of identified intervals in base pairs


d number of discarded intervals



with a coverage of about  <dig> fold, the correct interval was found, but this interval was about 25 % larger than the one identified with the full coverage. the correct interval with the correct length was identified starting at an average coverage of about  <dig> fold. however, at this coverage  <dig> additional “seeds” were detected but not extended to putative intervals because the regions around them stayed shorter than 500 bp . using a coverage of more than about  <dig> fold did not yield further improvements of interval detection. a similar lower limit of mapped read coverage of  <dig> fold for variant detection has also been concluded from a study that compared various snp and indel detection experiments  <cit> .

another difference between the mapping results from the different subsets was the portion of the genome covered adequately with reads. as can be seen in table  <dig>  a coverage of  <dig> fold was sufficient to cover over 90 % of the genome with at least  <dig> reads, which we consider the minimum for reliable variant calling and afe value determination. due to stochastic effects and sequencing biases in certain regions of the genome, the proportion of the genome sufficiently covered with mapped reads is reduced with lower overall coverage. in a mbs experiment where two pools have to be compared, reliable sequencing data has to be available in both pools for each position to compare. this can lead to significant data loss, if a random distribution of reads is assumed. for example: if the fraction of adequately covered sequence in each pool is 60 %, the fraction of the genome available for reliable comparison of afe values and interval detection might be reduced to only 36 % . therefore, it is important to perform initial calling of variant positions for the combined pools, so that the reads from both pools support each other for variant detection. with this approach, which is implemented in the gatk toolkit, the coverage can virtually be combined, and high quality variations for both pools can be called for a larger portion than if the pools were analyzed individually. still, the proportion of the genome covered by reads needs to be considered when planning a mbs experiment and the targeted coverage.

CONCLUSIONS
the ngs technology has improved forward genetics to an extent that has made the identification of causative mutations of a phenotype fast and straightforward. although there are probably still problematic cases, success has been shown numerous times . in most of these cases, the schedule applied did require sequencing of parental lines, generation of f <dig> or f <dig> individuals, backcrossing of mutant lines, prior knowledge of the location of the causative mutation or the use of existing markers. we carried out deep-sequencing of two phenotypic pools of  <dig> sugar beet accessions each from three breeding panels, and performed genome-wide analyses of differential afe values between the two pools. in our proof-of-principle case, a very small genetic interval of  <dig> kbp containing the causative gene  <cit>  for the green hypocotyl mutant phenotype was identified, and careful examination of the results indicated that additional evidence like categorization of snp/indel effects might have allowed to predict the correct gene even if it would have been unknown.

our approach allowed to identify a causative locus for a phenotype, in general within a few weeks after plant samples are harvested. neither prior knowledge nor additional sequencing of single offspring genotypes or parental lines was necessary. relatively high depth sequencing of the pools to at least  <dig> fold coverage was needed to get a reliable signal, and an increase of the coverage to  <dig> or  <dig> fold reduces the risk that the relevant genome region is less well covered by chance. extensive post processing of sequence data, read mapping, variation calling and exact determination of afe values, especially for indels, was essential for success. the gatk toolkit  <cit>  turned out to be a flexible and well adaptable tool to perform these processing steps that we successfully applied for a crop plant genome.

obviously, the approach relies on the availability of appropriate material, in our case phenotyped accessions of diverse genetic origin that share one mutant allele. for easy identification of the causal mutation the homozygous state of the plants in the pools was necessary. however, modern plant breeding often uses lines that have been bred to full homozygosity or applies double-haploid  technology so that useful genotypes for various phenotypes might be available in breeding panels. the next step would be to determine how heterozygosity in the pool derived from the dominant phenotype will affect the identification and resolution of the genetic confidence interval for other traits of interest in crop plants.
