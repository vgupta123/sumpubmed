BACKGROUND
the pig is a large animal species suitable not only for meat production, but also as a model organism for comparative genomics and biomedical studies  <cit> . due to the similarity of the dental and jaw bone system between human and pigs  <cit> , using swine in dental biomedical research has increased in recent years, including research into dental implants, irradiation damage to parotid glands, bio-root regeneration, osteoradionecrosis, and bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis, etc.  <cit> .

the mouse is the most widely used animal model for studying tooth development. almost all known molecular mechanisms of tooth formation and mineralization are derived indirectly or directly from studies of murine models  <cit> . however, mouse teeth are different from those of humans in both number and morphology, with only one dentition present throughout the mouse life cycle and a complete absence of canines and premolars  <cit> . miniature pigs have both deciduous and permanent dentition, and all tooth types found in humans are present in pigs. however, detailed descriptive information concerning tooth development in the pig is lacking. recently, our group has been dedicated to investigating the complicated mechanism of tooth development in miniature pigs, including the mrna expression profiles of developing deciduous molar tooth  <cit> , and the timing and sequencing of tooth replacement  <cit> . other groups also reported that early morphogenesis of heterodont dentition can be divided into four significant stages in miniature pigs  <cit> . the purpose of the present study was to identify and classify the early stages of odontogenesis in miniature pig’s deciduous molar teeth, focusing on the differential expression of cdnas during typical periods of tooth development. we also compared the genes from the e <dig> to e <dig> time course during tooth development with those of known homo sapiens genes, and aimed to obtain basic information about their development for further molecular studies. we found that  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes may be involved in the miniature pig’s tooth development. we also found there were  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated genes with high homology to those in homo sapiens, and compared these with those in mouse.

methods
ethics statement
pregnant wuzhishan miniature pigs were obtained from the institute of animal science of the chinese agriculture university. experiments were performed according to the regulations for the administration of affairs concerning experimental animals , and approved by the animal care and use committees of capital medical university, beijing, china under permit no. cmu-b <dig>  animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum under normal conditions and humanely sacrificed as necessary to ameliorate suffering. in brief, pregnant sows were anesthetized with a combination of 6 mg/kg ketamine chloride and  <dig>  mg/kg xylazine, and pregnancy and the fetal state roughly determined by b-mode ultrasonography. after removing the fetuses by cesarean section, the pregnant sows were sacrificed by over-anesthetization.

preparation of tissues and histological staining
developing miniature pig embryos were obtained by hysterectomy at embryonic days  <dig> , e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> according to the developmental progression of deciduous dentition in pigs  <cit> . after surgically removing the fetuses, germ tissue samples from deciduous molar teeth were removed from the mandibles under a microscope. the first mandibular molar could be obtained from e <dig>  the second mandibular molar could be obtained from e <dig>  the third mandibular molar could be obtained from e <dig>  so the first deciduous mandibular molars were used in all studies. the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored separately at -80°c until used for analysis. at least five miniature pig embryos were used for each evaluation. specimens for the histological study were chosen by random selection from each specific age group litter. embryo mandibles were separated and preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde. mandible specimens from e <dig> were placed in edta bone decalcifying agent. serial sections were made of the mandibular deciduous molar region. the tissues were mounted and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.

rna sample preparation and cdna library establishment
mandibular deciduous molar germs from e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> miniature pig embryos were excised and total rna was extracted with an rna purification kit . rna was then mixed in equal amounts from four different developmental time points. oligo dt cellulose  was used as a template to synthesize first-strand cdna. the cdna library was constructed using the smart cdna library construction kit . the obtained double-stranded -cdna was purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit , then normalized with the dsn  using the trimmer-direct kit . the normalized cdnas were digested with sfi i restriction enzyme, size fractionated , directionally ligated into pdnr-lib, and transformed into e. coli dh10b by electroporation. the cdna library was plated on lb plates with x-gal, isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and ampicillin. thirty white colonies were randomly selected for identification of cdna inserts in the recombinants to estimate the recombination efficiency. exact same samples were used for both microarray and qrt-pcr.

microarray procedures
microarray targets were prepared from each stage. rna labelling, hybridization and scanning were conducted by a commercial affymetrix array service . reverse transcription of rna and synthesis of biotin-labelled crna with one round of amplification were carried out following the standard affymetrix one-cycle protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions. samples were hybridized to the affymetrix 24 k genechip® porcine genome array . data analysis was performed with bioconductor implemented in r  <dig> . <dig> .

quantitative real-time rt-pcr
total rna reversely transcribed into cdna using the primescripttm pt reagent kit . amplifications of target genes were performed by real-time quantitative pcr  using the cdna as template, the specific primers and the sybr® primescript® rt–pcr kit  on an abi prism  <dig> real time pcr system . pcr amplifications were performed in duplicate at 95°c for 15 sec, and subjected to 40 cycles of 95°c for 5 sec 60°c for 30 sec, and 95°c for 15 sec 60°c for 15 sec 95°c for 15 sec. the primers used are shown in additional file  <dig>  the relative levels of target genes expression to the control of e <dig> were quantified. the relative levels of target gene mrna transcripts to control β-actin were determined by 2-ΔΔct.

cdna library sequencing, data processing, sequence analysis
after cdna library identification, large-scale plasmid extraction and sequencing were performed for generation of expressed sequence tags . high-quality ests were assembled into unigenes by phrap_ <dig>  software. the unigene sequences were performed with e-values of less than 10- <dig> on the genbank database according to the blast search program . the unigenes were compared with annotations through the gene ontology consortium using interpro2go. all ests were sequenced and analyzed at a commercial facility . if the unigene sequence was more than 100 bp and its homology greater than 90% with a known functional pig gene, this gene was annotated in the pig genes. then, if the sequence had high homology to a known gene in other species , it was assumed that the gene is an orthologue of the comparator gene.

statistical analysis
data of qrt-pcr are expressed as mean ± sem. data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. multiple comparison between the groups was performed by using bonferroni post-tests method. a p value of less than  <dig>  was considered statistically significant. statistical analysis was carried out using statview  <dig>  software  and graphpad prism  <dig>  software.

RESULTS
development stages and histological characterization of miniature pig mandibular deciduous molars
mandibular deciduous molar germs from e <dig> to e <dig> miniature pig embryos were excised . normal mandibular deciduous molars of miniature pigs have five or six main cusps and five roots . figure 1b shows the developmental stages of the mandibular deciduous molars. development progressed as follows:

e30: in the e <dig> embryonic mandible, the oral epithelium thickened and extended to form the dental lamina . e35: e <dig> samples showed hyperplasia of the lamina epithelium cells to form the primary enamel organ, meaning that the typical bud stage was observed . the mesenchymal cells surrounding the bud clearly gathered. the placode was identified between the epithelium and the mesenchyme. e40: in the e <dig> mandibular region, the molar remained in the bud stage, but minor changes were seen at this time . the peripheral cells of the enamel organ had now extended outside of the bud. e45: the typical cap stage for this molar did not appear until e <dig>  at this time, the entire enamel looked like a cap . more notable cell differentiation was present than at e <dig>  four cell types were identified; outer enamel epithelium, inner enamel epithelium, stellate reticulum, and dental papilla. the dental sac could also be observed. e50: e <dig> embryos showed the typical appearance of the early bell stage of this molar . the dental papilla was larger than during the cap stage, whereas there were no morphological changes of dental papilla cells. the cusp morphology could be seen at the junction of the inner enamel epithelium and dental papilla. inner enamel epithelial cells near the cusp region became stylolitic in shape, with the nucleolus far from the basalis. the stellate reticulum had sufficiently developed and the stratum intermedium appeared between the inner enamel epithelium and the stellate reticulum. e55: at this stage, there were no further changes except the adoption of a highly stylolitic shape by the inner enamel epithelial cells near the cusp region . e60: by e <dig>  the deciduous molar had reached the late bell stage of development . in the cusp region, dental epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells were polarized, and the cells lengthened to become pre-ameloblast and pre-odontoblast. at the same time, the pink matrix was seen in the cusp region. e65: at e <dig>  continuous and intact ameloblasts, enamel, dentin, and odontoblasts were observed in the molar cusp .

taken together, the crown development of miniature pigs’ mandibular deciduous molar were divided into five main periods as follows : the dental lamina stage , bud stage , cap stage , early bell stage , and late bell stage . the relatively typical time points are e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> .

verification of gene expression
amelogenin, membrane-associated ring finger  <dig> , isolate x <dig> mitochondrion, dspp <dig> , enamelin precursor, and caveolin were up-regulated at e <dig> compared with those at e <dig> in the microarray . ribosomal protein l <dig>  eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha , prothymosin alpha, selenoprotein p , quinoid dihydropteridine reductase  and cytochrome coxidase were down-regulated at e <dig> compared with those at e <dig> in the microarray . validation of microarray data was achieved by using qrt-pcr. the six up-regulated and down-regulated genes were changed accordingly . the mrna fold changes of all representative mrnas were consistent with those in the normalized microarray data.

cdna library overview
crown development in the miniature pig’s mandibular deciduous molars could be divided into four relatively typical periods as noted above. the mandibular deciduous molar germ cells were excised from miniature pig embryos at the e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> time points.

total rna from each period was used as template to synthesize cdna and construct a cdna library . the titer of the unamplified cdna library was approximately  <dig>  × 105 cfu/ml. a library comparison showed that all of the  <dig> selected clones had insert fragments, suggesting that the recombination rate was nearly 100% . the primary cdna library was used to generate ests. twenty-three thousand and six hundred independent white clones were picked randomly for est sequencing. a total of  <dig>  ests were sequenced from the cdna library. after removing the vector sequences and low-quality sequences ,  <dig>  high-quality sequences were obtained with an average length of  <dig>  bp, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length. overall,  <dig> % of the  <dig>  high-quality sequences were longer than 300 bp. cluster analyses assembled the  <dig>  high-quality ests into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons . the average length of the unigenes was 508 bp .

unigene size: the number of ests in unigene, 1percentage of all ests, 2percentage of unigenes.

unigene sequence analysis
unigenes were compared to annotations through the gene ontology consortium using interpro2go. graphs based on the go terms were created . under the cellular component category, most transcripts were linked to inherent cellular structure, as well as to the protein complex . in the category of molecular function, the five most abundant transcripts were involved in binding, catalytic activity, transporter activity, structural molecular activity, and signal transducer activity . the most common biological processes were physiological processes and cellular processes .

based on blast results,  <dig> %  of the unigenes were annotated to known genes, and  <dig> %  had a blast score greater than  <dig>  there were  <dig>  unknown unigenes  in the cdna library. unigenes whose sequences were markedly similar to known important proteins associated with dental development were found in this library, including ameloblastin, amelogenin, enamelin, dspp, and dmp <dig> . what’s more, expression of known specific transcription factors , growth factors , and related receptors  during murine tooth development also can be searched in the cdna library. these results indicated that the cdna library will be useful in facilitating further dental experiments in the miniature pig model.

homology searches showed that the top ten species were as follows: sus scrofa , homo sapiens , bos taurus , equus caballus , pan troglodytes , canis familiaris , macaca mulatta , pongo abelii , felis catus , and mouse . in the unigene homology to homo sapiens,  <dig> clones exhibited significant similarities to known genes . table  <dig> shows  <dig> unigenes with high homology to known homo sapiens genes.

cdna expression patterns during tooth development
we found that some cdna sequences in the library had high homology to known homo sapiens genes. because detailed descriptive information concerning tooth development in homo sapiens is lacking, miniature pigs are an optimal choice as a large animal model to investigate these molecular mechanisms. first, we compared all the four time periods with each other. the most differentially expressed genes were found between e <dig> and e <dig>  followed by the genes between e <dig> and e <dig> . and the fold change of all transcripts at e <dig> and e <dig> were the most significant . considering the germ tissue samples from e <dig> were small, and may have contained tissue from other nearby tissues, we blasted all the cdna clones from the e <dig> and e <dig> time points against human genome dna libraries. twelve highly conserved genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> highly conserved genes were down-regulated . these results suggest that the  <dig> highly conserved genes may be involved in both miniature pig and homo sapiens tooth development. furthermore,  <dig> down-regulated  and  <dig> up-regulated genes  in miniature pigs had higher homology to homo sapiens genes compared with those in the mouse .

discussion
in the present study, we constructed a cdna library from miniature pig molar tissue over the period of tooth development. we then confirmed the fold change of gene expression using qrt-pcr. using large-scale sequencing and ests assemblage, a large pool of unigenes were found in this library. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were assembled from  <dig>  ests, indicating that redundancy was only  <dig> %. furthermore, 95% of these unigenes contain only one or two ests, indicating the positive effect of cdna library normalization, which can be used to identify expressed genes in the future.

great progress has been made in the study of molecular mechanisms during tooth morphogenesis in the past 20 years, and most data were derived from studies on rodent embryos  <cit> . however, owing to its similarity to human anatomy and physiology, pig models are superior in many aspects for the study of human development, diseases, and pre-clinical therapies  <cit> . both domestic pigs and miniature pigs can be used in medical experimentation, but miniature pigs have many advantages, including an inherently small size, early sexual maturity, rapid breeding, and ease of management  <cit> . the deciduous molar in the chinese experimental miniature pig is oblong in shape and has five or six main cusps. it is bigger and has different morphology compared with all other deciduous teeth in the mandible, and it lies on the end of mandible body. all these characteristics contribute to being able to easily and accurately distinguish and isolate the tooth germ. there are high correlations between the deciduous and permanent teeth  <cit> . therefore, the deciduous molar was chosen as the first model tooth to evaluate in miniature pig tooth development.

there is little information concerning tooth development in large animal models  <cit> . some sequences in this cdna library had high similarity with proteins associated with dental development such as ameloblastin, amelogenin, enamelin, dspp, and dmp <dig>  <cit> . many genes involved in tooth development remain to be identified. for example, unigenes with high homology to known homo sapiens genes in this library included foxd <dig>  satb <dig>  zeb <dig> , etc. foxd <dig>  a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulations, plays a role in maintaining the epiblast and its derivatives and in establishing pluripotent esc lines  <cit> . satb <dig> is a recently cloned member of the family of special at-rich binding proteins. satb2-/-mice exhibit both craniofacial abnormalities that resemble those observed in humans carrying a satb <dig> translocation and defects in osteoblast differentiation and function  <cit> . zeb <dig> has been involved in mowat-wilson syndrome , a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype. mws is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in zeb <dig>  <cit> .

data from this study will facilitate further dental experiments in the miniature pig model. in the present study, we found that  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes may be involved in the miniature pig’s tooth development. we also found  <dig> down-regulated  and  <dig> up-regulated genes  in miniature pigs with higher homology to homo sapiens genes compared with those in the mouse. shank <dig> is a member of the shank family of synaptic proteins that function as molecular scaffolds in the postsynaptic density  <cit> . camk2n <dig>  expresses at high levels in osteogenic cells, and may be a good marker of osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . there is very little known about these genes and their roles in tooth development. investigating the functions of these genes in tooth development in a swine model and humans will be of great interest.

in summary, we evaluated the histological features of miniature pigs’ deciduous molar development and identified five primary phases. a miniature pig embryo tooth cdna library was constructed, which contains approximately  <dig>  × 105 cfu with  <dig>  high quality est sequences and  <dig>  unigenes. the established cdna library provides the basis for further tooth development studies using this animal model.

CONCLUSIONS
our results not only identify the specific transcriptome and cdna profile in developing mandibular deciduous molars of the miniature pig, but also provide useful information for investigating the molecular mechanism of tooth development in the miniature pig.
