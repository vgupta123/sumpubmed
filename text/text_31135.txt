BACKGROUND
the oxidative phosphorylation system  is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and is responsible for the production of atp, the energy currency of the cell. it is composed of five large complexes, the complexes of the respiratory chain  and the atp synthase, or complex v. the model organism saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks complex i, but instead has three single subunit nadh dehydrogenases. the other oxphos complexes ii-v are similar to the mammalian complexes. complex ii is composed of four subunits of nuclear origin while the complexes iii, iv and v are composed of subunits of dual genetic origin . a few core subunits are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, translated on mitochondrial ribosomes and immediately inserted into the membrane, while most subunits are encoded by nuclear genes, translated in the cytoplasm and imported into mitochondria via the tom/tim machineries . the assembly of the subunits appears to be coordinated  by site-specific translation mechanisms, both within and at the periphery of the mitochondria and numerous assembly factors that are extrinsic to the complexes have been identified. in addition, supra-complex associations, either between different mitochondrial complexes, or with the tim import machinery have been reported  <cit> . however, the assembly of the complexes, especially of complex iii, and the interactions between the complexes during their assembly is poorly understood.

complex iii occupies a central position in the respiratory chain, between the entry points of the electrons  and their exit, complex iv. the crystallographic structure of the enzyme from several sources has been determined  <cit> , and a modular assembly scheme has been proposed . until now, only six assembly factors specific for complex iii have been reported: cyt2p, bcs1p, cbp3p, cbp4p, mzm1p  and bca1p  <cit> , while more than  <dig> have been identified for the complex iv , an enzyme of similar complexity, suggesting that many of the factors involved in complex iii biogenesis remain to be discovered.

in order to identify proteins strongly connected with complex iii and to look for proteins participating in its assembly process, a systems biology approach could be used. many high-throughput datasets coming from genetic and proteomic studies concerning the yeast s. cerevisiae are accessible via public databases  <cit> . the interactome represents all the physical interactions between proteins of the cell. two main techniques have been used to produce high quality and complementary data: yeast two-hybrid studies , which enable systematic pair wise ppi identification and affinity-purification followed by mass spectrometry  . the integration of all these data generates a network represented by a graph where every node corresponds to a protein and every edge to an interaction. this large network is too complex to be used directly, so specific tools are needed in order to extract the relevant information from this network. many algorithms and methods of protein network analysis  have been developed and tested on the various datasets available for the yeast s. cerevisiae.

brohée and van helden  <cit>  tested different algorithms for clustering ppi networks. starting from all the ppi data of s. cerevisiae they showed that, they could find all the  <dig> protein complexes presently documented in the mips database  <cit> . amongst these algorithms, some enable the extraction of independent classes , while others enable the extraction of overlapping classes . each of these algorithms identifies sub-networks having a specific topology: weakly interconnected clusters  <cit>  or strongly interconnected clusters  <cit> . within the latter group, mcode  <cit>  and clusterone  <cit>  identify large-sized clusters. this is particularly interesting for our purpose, because biochemical analyses suggest that there are few assembly modules for complex iii and that these modules contain numerous strongly interconnected proteins.

in this report, we used a systems biology approach that consists of the integration of data from different types of experiments, but mainly from large-scale studies. using the apid  <cit>  and biogrid databases  <cit> , we collected all the physical interactions concerning the core subunits, the supernumerary subunits and the assembly factors of complex iii. after the repeated partitioning of the initial network into sub-graphs we identified a group of proteins having few interactions with the main complex iii sub-graph. cell biology and genetic methods were then used to investigate the function of one of the proteins identified by our in silico approach.

RESULTS
network modelling
in order to find new proteins involved in complex iii biogenesis, we used the cytoscape facilities  <cit>  to combine all the physical interactions concerning complex iii  from the apid  <cit>  and biogrid databases  <cit> .

complex iii is defined by three groups of proteins: catalytic core and supernumerary subunits that are part of the structure, and other proteins involved in the assembly of the complex. uniprot id was used to retrieve data in apid database whereas in biogrid  it was the sgd name.

the computational approach leading to the complete ppi network  gave the following results:

1) from the apid database, we obtained a list of  <dig> unique ppi involving  <dig> proteins .

2) from the biogrid database,  <dig> unique ppi involving  <dig> different proteins were collected . some of these interactions are new and allowed us to enrich those obtained from apid.

3) among these new interactions, some concern eleven new proteins of which some have numerous direct ppi. for example, there are  <dig> physical interactions with nab2p and  <dig> with ubi4p, proteins that are independent of complex iii. we will discuss later the consequences of these ppi on the network.

4) the final list, obtained by merging the three ppi lists and eliminating redundancy, was composed of  <dig> unique ppi involving  <dig> proteins.  <dig> proteins are common to both databases,  <dig> are from apid and  <dig> from biogrid. eliminating redundancy facilitates the identification of links between proteins not often studied and proteins known to be involved in complexes.

5) the resulting network was too large to yield any interesting information. it was necessary to divide it into highly connected sub-graphs that represent functional modules, or protein sub-complexes that we could consider as assembly intermediates.

network clustering
to identify new proteins associated with the assembly intermediates of complex iii, we looked for sub-groups of strongly interconnected proteins. first we looked for overlapping sub-graphs to take into account the fact that one protein can be associated with several sub-complexes. in this way the network was sub-divided in  <dig> sub-graphs , of which six have p-values under  <dig>  and good quality scores . note that the clustering method is robust, since the same sub-graphs are found when starting the analysis from only the core and supernumerary proteins.

cluster  <dig> is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins; cluster  <dig> is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins and cluster  <dig> of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins . all are built around non-mitochondrial proteins having many interactions independent of complex iii. for example nab2p is a nuclear polyadenylated rna-binding protein, ubi4p is a ubiquitin, ssa2p is a stress-seventy subfamily a protein, rpn10p a non-atpase subunit of the regulatory particle of the 26s proteasome, tef1p a translational elongation factor and ssb1p is a ribosome-associated molecular chaperone. clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> thus contain ppi that are not specific for complex iii.

cluster  <dig> is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins and cluster  <dig> is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins . the majority of these proteins are translocases involved in the import of proteins into mitochondria, but there are also a few proteins involved in complex iii: bcs1p, cobp and cbp2p, a protein of complex iv: cox7p, and atp1p and atp2p, two proteins of the f <dig> part of complex v. these clusters are clearly not specific for complex iii as they include only a few proteins of the input list.

cluster  <dig>  is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins, including all the complex iii subunits. when it was split again into overlapping sub-graphs, only one sub-graph  was extracted, with  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins. its quality is equal to  <dig> . most of proteins of this sub-graph are members of complex iii  and complex iv  or participate in the assembly of complex iv . the fact that this network contains proteins from complexes iii and iv, although our input list was exclusively composed of proteins of complex iii is probably related to the existence of iii-iv super-complexes, which have been clearly identified in blue native gels of mitochondrial extracts  <cit> . our results show that many associations link these complexes. furthermore, several assembly factors of complex iv identified here interact with several subunits of complex iii: cor1p, qcr2p, cyt1p, suggesting that some factors may play a role in the assembly of both complexes iii and iv.

as it was no longer possible to split the cluster  <dig> , which is still large, into overlapping sub-graphs it was divided into independent clusters: cluster  <dig> . <dig> is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins belonging to complex iv, three proteins of complex iii  and aac1p, a minor isoform of the adp/atp mitochondrial transporter . cluster  <dig> . <dig> is composed of  <dig> ppi involving  <dig> proteins; most of them are members of complex iii  and one protein pet9p/aac <dig>  the major isoform of the adp/atp transporter . thus the cluster  <dig>  can be separated into two parts corresponding broadly to complexes iii  and iv . however, a few proteins are linked with the proteins of the other complex rather than with the proteins of their own complex. for example, cor1p and qcr2p are in the sub-graph of complex iv rather than in the sub-graph of complex iii as they have more interactions with proteins of complex iv and aac1p than with the other subunits of complex iii. this strengthens the hypothesis of the existence of common factors involved in the assembly process of both complexes.

if we subtract the two sub-clusters  from cluster  <dig> , nine proteins are left, of which five  are connected to cor1p and qcr2p. they form a sub-graph, which is not interconnected enough to be detected by mcode.

among these proteins usb1p is the only one whose function is unknown. the association of these three proteins  corresponds to a complex isolated by tandem affinity purification by gavin et al.  <cit> . thus usb1p is connected with complex iii, and more particularly to the cor1p  <cit>  and qcr2p sub-units  <cit>  . this result obtained in silico led us to study the function of usb1p using genetic and cell biology methods.

usb1p is located in both the nucleus and the mitochondria
the in silico analysis has shown that usb1p belongs to the cluster  <dig>  that contains all the complex iii subunits, six out of the  <dig> subunits of complex iv, as well as six assembly factors of complex iv. in order to determine if usb1p could be involved in the biogenesis of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes iii and/or iv, we first analyzed its sub-cellular localization.

large-scale analysis of the localization of gfp-tagged s. cerevisiae proteins suggested that usb1p exhibits a multiple location in the nucleus, the cytoplasm and the mitochondria  <cit> . to verify this localization, usb1p was tagged at its c-terminus with gfp. the genetic construction was integrated at the usb <dig> chromosomal locus in a strain carrying a cfp-tagged nic <dig> protein that revealed the pores of the nuclear membrane  <cit> . the usb1-gfp gene is therefore expressed under the control of its own promoter sequence in order to avoid mislocalization due to overexpression when the construction is carried on a plasmid. cells expressing the nic96-cfp and the usb1-gfp fusion proteins were examined by fluorescence microscopy using the appropriate filters. mitotracker was used to stain the mitochondrial network. as shown in figure  <dig> andadditional file  <dig> , usb1-gfp was located within the nucleus  whose membrane was also stained by the nic96-cfp  as well as in fluorescent tubules also stained with the mitotracker probe . thus the usb1-gfp protein has a dual localization in the nucleus and mitochondria.

overexpression of usb <dig> compensates specific respiratory defects
systematic deletion analysis suggested that the gene could be essential  <cit> . indeed, we were not able to obtain any viable haploid cell carrying a deleted allele of the usb <dig> gene from a heterozygous diploid strain . to further investigate its role, within mitochondria, we have analyzed the effect of the overexpression of the usb <dig> gene on a set of respiratory deficient mutants. we have cloned usb <dig> on a multicopy plasmid and transformed either a wild type strain or a collection of respiratory deficient mutants that carry mutations in various factors essential for the biogenesis of the respiratory complexes. table  <dig> and figure 4a show that the overexpression of usb <dig> compensates for the respiratory deficiency of an oxa1-e65g-f229s mutant and the deletion of mft <dig>  but not a bcs <dig> mutant, or the deletions of oxa <dig>  bcs <dig> or rmd <dig>  the same level of compensation was observed with the oxa <dig> and mtf <dig> mutants. we have previously shown that the respiratory deficiency of the oxa1-e65g-f229s mutant is correlated to a strong decrease of cytochrome b of complex iii and cytochromes aa <dig> of complex iv  <cit> . cytochrome spectra of cells grown on respiratory medium show that the overexpression of usb <dig> in the oxa <dig> mutant restored the assembly of cytochromes b and aa <dig> . thus the overexpression of usb <dig> specifically compensates for some respiratory deficiencies.

respiratory-deficient mutants affecting various steps in the biogenesis of the respiratory complexes were transformed with three different high-copy plasmids:  the empty control vector,  the plasmid carrying the corresponding wild type gene ,  the plasmid carrying the wild type usb <dig> gene. the transformants were selected on minimal glucose medium lacking uracil to select for the plasmids and their growth were tested on non fermentable medium containing 2% glycerol and 2% ethanol at  <dig> or 36°c. +: respiratory growth; - no growth. see also figure 4a. the oxa <dig> mutant carries a double amino-acid substitution e65g-f229s in the oxa <dig> protein  <cit> . the bcs <dig> mutant carries a single amino-acid substitution f342c in bcs1p  <cit> . the other mutants carry gene deletions as indicated  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although several computational approaches combined with experimental methods  have recently established a comprehensive network for the mitochondrial proteome, our analysis is the first systems biology study strictly devoted to the oxphos complexes in yeast. as there are huge amounts of interaction data from different sources  it is not easy to choose which gene/protein is the best candidate for further analysis in a complicated system like oxphos, which is composed of several complexes. thus, an integrative method can help to orient subsequent research and can also highlight specific interactions between the complexes.

our approach revealed multiple associations between subunits of complexes iii and iv and interactions with the adp/atp transporters. cluster  <dig>  identifies connections between complex iii subunits, complex iv subunits and assembly factors, suggesting some interaction during the assembly process of these two complexes . for example, our results show that the assembly factor shy1p is connected with all the proteins of the cluster  <dig> . <dig>  i.e. with the complex iii subunits, cor1p, qcr2p, cyt1p and some subunits and assembly factors of complex iv. the minor adp/atp transporter, aac1p is also part of the same cluster. cluster  <dig> . <dig> is composed of core  and supernumerary proteins , as well as pet9p/aac2p, the major adp/atp transporter.

although some subunits of the complex ii  are present in the ppi network we did not retrieve them in the clusters, suggesting that the interactions between complex iii and complex ii are weak. cyc1p is also present in the ppi network but there is no strong connection with cytochrome c. however, cytochrome c is a mobile carrier, shuttling electrons between complexes iii and iv and the interactions are probably too dynamic to be detected by our analysis that only detects strongly interconnected proteins. no connections have been found between complex iii and the nadh dehydrogenases suggesting that there is no tight contact between them.

finally, the approach identified a protein usb1p that had probably escaped previous genetic screens because it is essential for cell survival. this protein has a dual localization, in the nucleus and mitochondria. overexpression of usb <dig> compensates for the respiratory deficiency of an oxa <dig> mutant. oxa1p mediates the co-translational insertion of mitochondrially-encoded subunits of the respiratory complexes within the inner membrane . we have previously shown that an increase in the steady state level of mitochondrial mrnas encoding respiratory complex subunits can also compensate for the respiratory deficiency of this oxa <dig> mutant via the overexpression of rmd <dig>  rmd9p controls the processing/stability of all the mitochondrial mrnas encoding respiratory subunits but might also control the initiation of mitochondrial translation  <cit> . the overexpression of usb <dig> cannot compensate for the absence of rmd9p but can restore respiratory growth to a deletion of mtf <dig>  that affects the processing/stability of two mitochondrial mrnas, encoding two subunits of complex v  <cit> . mtf2p was also shown to interact with the mitochondrial rna polymerase  <cit> . finally, usb1p was detected in a systematic screen for rna-binding proteins in yeast  <cit> . because of the dual location of usb1p, in the nucleus and mitochondria, it is tempting to suggest that usb1p might control the processing or stability of nuclear and mitochondrial rnas. as the mitochondrial respiratory function is not required for yeast viability, the essential function of usb1p would be due to its eventual role in stability/processing of nuclear rna.

thus, the sub-graph analysis that we have developed has highlighted the strong connections between subunits and assembly factors of the complexes iii and iv and has led to the identification of a new factor acting in the biogenesis of respiratory complexes in yeast.
