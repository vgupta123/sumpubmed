BACKGROUND
developmental organization of each particular animal body plan is controlled by a conserved bilaterian-wide cluster of homeotic genes. one of these clusters, the hox genes, with a conserved homeodomain sequence, possesses a distinctive genomic arrangement and it encodes a set of transcription factors that play a crucial role in organizing the antero-posterior  body axis of many bilaterian animals during development . a number of hox gene expression studies have been published for various bilaterian clades, but most of them are confined to ecdysozoan or deutoterstome representatives , while data on lophotrochozoans outside the annelida  are scarce.

mollusca is one of the most diverse animal phyla. according to recent phylogenomic analyses , mollusks contain two monophyletic sister taxa, the primarily univalved conchifera  and the non- or eight-shelled aculifera . thereby, recent developmental data have shown that the aculiferans most likely originated from a polyplacophoran-like ancestor, implying that the simple vermiform morphology of the aplacophorans evolved by secondary simplification  <cit> .

until today, an overall number of  <dig> hox genes has been identified in seven out of the eight molluscan “class”-level taxa , but expression studies on hox genes are restricted to representatives of two, probably derived, clades of mollusca that belong to the conchiferans, namely gastropoda  and cephalopoda . the existing expression data on mollusca are limited to larvae of the gastropods haliotis asinina, h. rufescens and gibbula varia, and to developing embryos of the cephalopods euprymna scolopes and sepia officinalis. these data show that the hox genes are involved in the formation of specific morphological features such as the shell, the ganglionic nervous system, the tentacles and the funnel, and that they are - contrary to other bilaterians - expressed in a non-co-linear pattern . furthermore, hox transcription products could also be identified in sensory organs  and in the light organ of squid embryos  <cit> . as opposed to this, in most other bilaterians, hox genes do show co-linearity and play a crucial role in organizing the antero-posterior body axis  <cit> . the gastropod and cephalopod expression data suggest that hox genes may have been co-opted into the formation of novel molluscan morphological features .

in contrast to gastropods and cephalopods, polyplacophorans possess a number of non-conchiferan characters such as serially arranged shell muscles, dorsal shell plates, as well as a non-ganglionic visceral and pedal nervous system with iterated commissures  <cit> . in order to assess potential functions of hox genes in non-conchiferan mollusks, we here present the first data on hox gene expression in an aculiferan mollusk, the polyplacophoran acanthochitona crinita .

RESULTS
hox gene orthologs and phylogenetic analysis
in the assembled transcriptome of acanthochitona crinita , orthologous hox gene sequences were identified. the sequences of the genes acr-hox1- <dig>  acr-hox <dig> and acr-post <dig> contain a conserved homeo-domain amino-acid sequence and acr-hox1- <dig>  acr-hox4- <dig> and acr-hox <dig> are flanked by the ywm-motif at the n-terminal . all acr-hox protein sequences cluster together with their respective bilaterian orthologs, as revealed by the phylogenetic analysis .fig.  <dig> homeodomain alignment. sequence alignment containing hox gene homeo-domains  and the flanking regions. the residues are bluish colored in each column according to the percentage of identity that agrees with the consensus sequence. residues with less than 40 % of identity are not colored. dashes represent missing data

larval development of acanthochitona crinita
early trochophore larvae of a. crinita are less than 200 μm long  and have an apical tuft at the anterior pole. the well-developed prototroch divides the pre-trochal area  from the post-trochal region . ventro-medially, posterior to the prototroch, the mouth opening  is located.

mid-trochophore larvae are oval-shaped and approximately 280 μm in length . the hyposphere is more elongated, and posterior to the mouth opening the developing anlage of the foot extends in the ventral region. dorso-laterally, on both sides of the hyposphere, a longitudinal row of epidermal and very prominent spicule-containing cells are discernible. dorsally, an anterior transversal row of spicule-containing cells is present in the episphere and in the posterior region of the hyposphere. in this stage the anlagen of the seven dorsal shell plates are already visible in the hyposphere.fig.  <dig> morphology of acanthochitona crinita trochophore larvae. anterior faces up. a, b mid-trochophore larvae. episphere and hyposphere are separated from each other by the prototroch. in the dorsal hyposphere region, the anlagen of the seven shells are surrounded by spicule-containing cells. c, d late trochophore larvae. seven differentiating dorsal shell plates are present. at apical tuft, ds dorsal shell plates, f foot, pt prototroch, sc spicule-forming cell



late trochophore larvae are about 360 μm in length and the hyposphere is considerably more elongated than in previous stages . on the dorsal side of the hyposphere, seven differentiating shell plates are present. at the end of the entirely lecithotrophic, i.e., non-feeding larval development, late trochophore larvae settle and undergo metamorphosis, which is characterized by considerable dorso-ventral flattening of the animals as well as loss of the apical ciliary tuft and the prototroch  <cit> .

discussion
hox gene expression in aculiferan and conchiferan mollusks
the existing expression data of three species of gastropods  and two cephalopod species  show a comparable structural expression pattern during development. by contrast, the hox genes are expressed in epidermal and sub-epidermal cell layers, in a co-linear manner along the antero-posterior axis in the hyposphere of early and mid-trochophore larvae of a. crinita .fig.  <dig> schematic summary of hox gene expression in acanthochitona crinita. each box shows the specific acr-hox1- <dig>  hox <dig> and post <dig> gene expression patterns in mid  and late  trochophore larvae in ventral  and dorsal view , respectively



in early and mid-stage acanthochitona crinita trochophores, acr-hox <dig> transcripts are found in two ventro-lateral cell clusters, next to the stomodaeum, and dorsally in a slender transversal band. in contrast, in the gastropod gibbula varia, the hox <dig> ortholog  is expressed in the larval dorso-posterior shell anlage  <cit> . acr-hox <dig> transcripts are present in two ventral, short and parallel longitudinal strands, postero-lateral to the stomodaeum, and acr-hox <dig> expression is also present in two distinct ventral parallel longitudinal strands that extend farther in posterior direction than the acr-hox <dig> expression domain. the acr-hox <dig> ortholog is highly expressed in two domains which are antero-medially interconnected by a slender band. gva-hox2- <dig> and has-hox2- <dig>  transcripts are distributed in the ventral ectoderm, postero-laterally around the foot anlage  <cit> . acr-hox <dig> is expressed in two ventral longitudinal strands in the posterior region of the hyposphere, whereas in gastropod trochophore larvae only a faint endodermal gva-hox <dig> expression adjacent to the foot rudiment was found  <cit> . acr-hox <dig> is expressed in a ring-like pattern in the posterior hyposphere; this pattern differs strongly from that observed in the trochophores of the gastropod gibbula varia, where gva-hox <dig> is exclusively expressed in the trochoblasts  <cit> . acr-post <dig> expression is present in the posterior pole of the hyposphere, while in gibbula, a certain number of cells that surround the posterior foot anlage dorsally express gva-post <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison of hox gene expression patterns in annelid , polyplacophoran  and gastropod  larvae. antero-posterior hox gene expression gradient in the larval body is indicated by colored vertical bars  on the left side of each trochophore larva. the comparison reveals a relatively similar co-linear hox gene expression pattern in annelida and polyplacophora, whereas in gastropods hox gene transcripts are expressed non-co-linearly and are often confined to specific morphological features such as the prototroch or the shell field. annelid data based on nereis virens and platynereis dumerilii  <cit>  and gastropod data based on gibbula varia  <cit> . black small circle illustrates the mouth opening, horizontal band the prototroch and ellipse the ventral foot



in late acanthochitona crinita trochophore larvae, the expression pattern is faint at best or entirely absent , while a distinct distribution of orthologous hox gene transcripts is present in pre- and post-torsional veliger stages of the gastropods gibbula varia and haliotis asinina. thereby, gva-hox <dig>  gva-post <dig> and has-hox <dig> are expressed in the mantle and especially in the shell field  <cit> . gva- and has-hox2- <dig> transcripts are present in the operculum and in the foot anlage  <cit> . however, the main expression domains of gva-hox2- <dig> and has-hox2- <dig>  as well as that of haliotis rufescens-hox <dig>  and gva-hox <dig> are in the cerebral, branchial, esophageal, pedal and pleural ganglia  <cit> . orthologs of hox <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the embryos of the cephalopod euprymna scolopes  are expressed in the developing cerebral, palliovisceral and pedal ganglia, and esc-hox <dig>   <dig> and post <dig> in the stellar ganglion  <cit> . esc-hox <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and post <dig> are also expressed in cephalopod-specific structures such as the brachial crown and the funnel  <cit> . as in e. scolopes, in embryos of the european cuttlefish sepia officinalis the ortholog of sof-hox <dig> is also expressed in distinct nervous system and locomotory structures. sof-hox <dig> transcripts are present in the sub-esophageal masses, brachial, buccal and stellar ganglia and in parts of the funnel  <cit> .

in comparison to the hox gene expression data on gastropods and cephalopods, the polyplacophoran a. crinita hox gene transcripts are not restricted to particular subsets of the developing nervous system . this may be due to the medullary cord-like character of the polyplacophoran nervous system which, in contrast to the gastropods and cephalopods, lacks distinct ganglia . data on polyplacophoran neurogenesis have shown that in early and mid-trochophore larvae of ischnochiton hakodadensis and mopalia muscosa the primary pedal neurons  develop and extend posteriorly  <cit> . interestingly, in the post-trochal region in early and mid-stage a. crinita trochophore larvae, the transcripts of the acr-hox1- <dig> genes are present in two parallel antero-posterior medial expression domains, which overlap with the region of the developing neurons of the future paired pedal nerve cords. in contrast, in the lateral post-trochal areas of the developing visceral nerve cords, no overlapping acr-hox gene expression pattern is present. however, in a. crinita, the overall expression pattern is not restricted to, e.g., the developing pedal nerve cords. instead, the acr-hox gene transcripts are also found in more lateral and more central sub-epidermal tissues which clearly do not contribute to neural tissues .

developmental data on the muscular system have shown that in early and mid-trochophore larvae of mopalia muscosa and leptochiton asellus several muscle fibers start to develop in the post-trochal region . the hox gene transcripts in early and mid-stage a. crinita trochophore larvae are expressed in a region comparable to that where these  muscles form. however, the acr-hox gene expression pattern is not restricted to individual muscular structures.

henry and colleagues  <cit>  labeled derivatives of the endoderm in the polyplacophoran species chaetopleura apiculata via injected fluorescent markers in cell lineage experiments. thereby, it was found that in early and mid-trochophore larvae of c. apiculata, third-quartet macromeres give rise to the developing body wall and the  gut in the post-trochal region. in early and mid-stage a. crinita trochophore larvae, the transcripts of anterior hox genes  are present post-trochally around the forming stomodaeum and adjacent to the central area of the forming digestive tract .

indeed, in the polyplacophoran acanthochitona crinita, the hox gene expression patterns are not restricted to distinct morphological structures . however, comparable developmental polyplacophoran data and also the hox gene expression patterns indicate, that the acr-hox gene transcripts are seemingly present in tissues derived from all three germ layers . these expression patterns differ significantly from the hox gene expression pattern in gastropods and cephalopods , indicating that hox genes are involved in different, taxon-specific developmental processes in gastropods and cephalopods, but not in polyplacophorans. in contrast, the polyplacophoran transcripts acr-hox1- <dig>  hox <dig> and acr-post <dig> are distributed in a specific spatial antero-posterior pattern. anterior hox genes  are only expressed in the anterior hyposphere, next to the stomodaeum, and posterior hox gene transcripts  are only present in the posterior hyposphere. this antero-posterior mode of expression resembles that of the co-linear hox gene expression in the vast majority of bilaterian animals, including acoelomorpha, annelida, ecdysozoa and deuterostomia  and thus appears to have been conserved in polyplacophoran mollusks.

in this study, the expression of seven out of the putatively  <dig> molluscan hox genes was investigated in the polyplacophoran acanthochitona crinita. preliminary data on the yet missing genes acr-lox <dig>  lox <dig> and lox <dig>  are in line with the antero-posterior hox gene expression pattern described herein.

antero-posterior hox gene expression in polyplacophora and annelida
comparing our results with those of annelida, a taxon probably closely related to mollusca , important similarities in the spatial hox gene expression patterns along the antero-posterior axis become obvious . early trochophore larvae of the annelids nereis virens and platynereis dumerilii show a strikingly similar co-linear hox gene expression pattern to that of acanthochitona in the ventral hyposphere. in a. crinita, the acr-hox <dig> expression is located in the anterior hyposphere; orthologs of n. virens-hox <dig>  and p. dumerilii-hox <dig>  are similarly expressed in the anterior hyposphere, the future first parapodial segment  <cit> . the acr-hox <dig> expression postero-lateral to the stomodaeum is similar to the stomodeal pdu-hox <dig> expression  <cit> . the two lateral expression strands of acr-hox <dig> resemble the nvi-hox <dig> and pdu-hox <dig> expression strands  <cit> . acr-hox <dig> transcription products appear along the ventral and lateral hyposphere of the polyplacophoran, similar to the ventral and lateral expression of nvi-hox <dig> and pdu-hox <dig> in the developing second and third parapodial segments and the site of acr-hox <dig> expression is comparable to that of nvi-hox <dig> and pdu-hox <dig> expression in the developing second and third parapodial segment  <cit> . acr-hox <dig> transcripts are distributed posteriorly in a dorso-ventral ring-like pattern; nvi-hox <dig> and pdu-hox <dig> are also expressed posteriorly, namely in the developing third parapodial and pygidial segment  <cit> . acr-post <dig> expression is restricted to the posterior pole, similar to the pygidial expression of nvi-post <dig> and pdu-post <dig>  <cit> . in addition to the expression data in n. virens and p. dumerilii, a relatively similar ap expression pattern is also known from other early annelid developmental stages .

overall, the relative spatial antero-posterior hox gene expression pattern in early developmental stages of nereis virens and platynereis dumerilii, as well as other annelids, is comparable to that of the polyplacophoran acanthochitona crinita. in particular, the spatial antero-posterior hox gene expression pattern in early polyplacophoran trochophores is also found in the ecto-, endo- and mesodermal cell layers and is thus not restricted to specific organs. annelid hox gene expression in the nervous system appears for the first time in meta-trochophore larvae  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the relatively similar co-linear hox gene expression signature in polyplacophora, annelida and other bilaterians demonstrates that the ancestral role of hox genes in mollusca was also in patterning of the antero-posterior body axis. after the aculiferan-conchiferan split, the hox genes were secondarily recruited into novel functions in gastropods and cephalopods , but data on bivalves, scaphopods and monoplacophorans are needed to further substantiate this assumption. overall, the plasticity of hox gene functions in mollusks may well explain the high morphological variability exhibited among the various molluscan sub-lineages and may thus have been an important driving force for the evolutionary success of gastropods and cephalopods.
