BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligately anaerobic bacterium. it is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhoea among patients undergoing antibiotic treatment  <cit> . the severity of c. difficile-associated disease  ranges from mild diarrhoea to pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and intestinal perforation  <cit> . mortality rates of cdad reportedly range from  <dig> to 30%  <cit> . during the last decade, the incidence of cdad has increased significantly in north america  <cit>  and europe  <cit> . in the usa and canada, this increase has been associated with the emergence of a novel, hypervirulent strain designated nap1/ <dig>  <cit> . strains with the same genotype and associated outbreaks have also been reported from several european countries  <cit> .

for infection control investigations and epidemiological studies, it is mandatory to track the emergence and spread of epidemic strains. for this purpose, appropriate genotyping methods are needed. the utility of a typing method will depend on its inter-laboratory reproducibility and data portability, its discriminatory power and concordance of identified groupings with epidemiology, the temporal stability of the genetic markers investigated, and the universal typeability of isolates  <cit> . multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis  is the most discriminatory method presently available for typing c. difficile  <cit> . recently reported results suggested that the level of resolution achieved through mlva may be highly useful for detecting epidemiological clusters of cdad within and between hospitals  <cit> . the genetic loci currently exploited for mlva-typing of c. difficile accumulate variation so rapidly, however, that longer-term relationships between isolates get obscured  <cit> . it is therefore advisable – and has been a common practice – to combine mlva with the analysis of more conserved genetic markers  <cit> . most commonly applied approaches to genotyping c. difficile at present are dna macrorestriction analysis  and pcr ribotyping . these two methods yield largely concordant results  <cit> . while dna macrorestriction has slightly higher discriminatory power than pcr ribotyping, it is also more labour-intensive and time consuming  <cit> .

a major disadvantage of pcr ribotyping, dna macrorestriction, and other band-based typing techniques   <cit> ) is the poor portability and interlaboratory comparability of the generated data. bacterial strains to be compared usually need to be run on the same electrophoresis gels, which requires the exchange of reference strains between institutions. this requirement seriously hampers epidemiological investigations, particularly at international scales  <cit> .

typing procedures based on dna sequences overcome these limitations, since sequence data may easily be exchanged and stored in databases that are accessible via the internet. accordingly, a scheme for multilocus sequence typing  of c. difficile was developed recently that is based on sequences from seven housekeeping gene fragments  <cit> . while mlst to date has been applied to a limited number of isolates, available data allowed a first glimpse at the largely clonal genetic population structure of c. difficile  <cit> . in clonal bacteria, novel genotypes in the course of evolution are generated primarily through mutations, which in slowly evolving housekeeping genes are rare. hence, it is this very clonality of c. difficile and the associated linkage disequilibrium that causes mlst to provide poor discriminatory power, which is exemplified by the fact that relevant epidemic strains are not resolved  <cit> . in addition, mlst remains too expensive to be applied for routine typing aside from dedicated research projects.

more variable genomic regions may provide improved discrimination ability. in contrast to mlst, it may even suffice to sequence a single locus or very few genetic loci that are sufficiently variable, since – analysing a clonal population – phylogenetic inferences will rarely be confounded through homologous genetic recombination. sequence-based typing schemes relying on one or several highly discriminatory markers have previously been established for a number of pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus   <cit> , campylobacter jejuni   <cit> , streptococcus pyogenes   <cit>  and neisseria meningitidis   <cit> .

the surface layer protein gene slpa has recently been proposed as a promising target for sequence-based typing of c. difficile  <cit> . the limited data available suggests extremely high sequence variation among isolates and, correspondingly, excellent discriminatory power  <cit> . to date, however, slpa sequencing reportedly has been applied to a total of only  <dig> different ribotypes, and it is not clear if the method is universally applicable  <cit> . it is anticipated that the requirement for degenerate oligonucleotide primers may restrict the general utility of the current protocol  <cit> . the method has as yet not been successfully transferred to any other laboratory  <cit> .

this present report describes the development and application of a new assay for genotyping c. difficile that is based on sequence analysis of two stretches of repetitive dna. investigating a panel of  <dig> diverse c. difficile isolates, we demonstrate extensive sequence variation in these genomic regions, resulting in high discriminatory power, and excellent concordance with pcr ribotyping.

RESULTS
identification of tandem repeat regions suitable for sequence-based typing
a total of  <dig> tandem repeat regions that met the selection criteria  were detected in the genome sequence from strain  <dig> by using the program tandem repeats finder version  <dig>   <cit> . for  <dig> of these repeat regions, it was possible to design pcr primers targeting flanking sequences, and from  <dig>  pcr amplification products could reliably be generated from a panel of reference isolates. however, at  <dig> of these loci, sequence variation was insufficient to discriminate widely distributed strains, including ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the remaining three repeat regions could discriminate most of the ribotypes examined. the two most variable loci were designated tr <dig> and tr <dig> . they are located at positions  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb of the c. difficile  <dig> chromosome, respectively, and exhibited both, sequence and length polymorphisms. locus tr <dig> is composed of 21-basepair repeat units and resides within an open reading frame encoding a hypothetical protein . a homology search in public databases did not identify any significant similarities with known proteins. in contrast, tr <dig> is located within a predicted non-coding region. it consists of 22-basepair repeats.

b based on analysis of  <dig> isolates typed in this study.

we developed a dna based typing scheme for c. difficile based on the sequence variation of tr <dig> and tr <dig>  to facilitate the application of the tandem repeat sequence typing  scheme, a duplex pcr was designed which allowed simultaneous amplification of both loci . sequence data were generated from duplex pcr products using the same primers as for amplification. nucleotide sequences from tr <dig> and tr <dig> were concatenated and unique repeat successions were assigned distinct trst types . a detailed comparison of trst with pcr ribotyping is described in the following.

clonal evolution of tandem repeat regions
genomic regions with short tandem repeat regions may evolve fast due to intra-molecular recombination and frequent polymerase slippage during dna replication  <cit> . accordingly, loci tr <dig> and tr <dig> displayed both, sequence polymorphisms, generated through exchange of individual nucleobases , and length polymorphisms, as a consequence of repeat copy number variation . sequences of individual repeats were highly variable, with a nucleotide diversity π of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for tr <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for tr <dig>  the majority of nucleotide substitutions at locus tr <dig> were synonymous, i. e., they left the encoded amino acid sequence unaffected, and hence may be considered selectively neutral. this was reflected by a ka/ks value of  <dig> , suggesting tr <dig> sequences evolve under purifying selection. locus tr <dig> does not encode any protein and, hence, sequence variation likely is neutral, too.

furthermore, there is evidence of rare recombination between chromosomes from different strains, affecting tandem repeat sequences. one homologous recombination event apparently generated trst type tr- <dig>  while tr- <dig> shares an identical tr <dig> sequence with tr- <dig> , its tr <dig> allele differs profoundly from that of tr- <dig> in both, length and sequence , even though isolates displaying tr- <dig>  and tr- <dig>  are affiliated to the same mlst type  and ribotype . interestingly, the tr <dig> allele of tr- <dig> is identical to the one of tr- <dig> . hence, the drastic difference between central parts of tr <dig> in tr- <dig> and tr- <dig> may be explained through a single event of horizontal gene transfer from an unrelated strain. very similarly, tr- <dig> and tr- <dig> share identical alleles with closely related trst types at either tr <dig> or tr <dig>  respectively, yet differ drastically along a contiguous stretch of central repeats at the other tandem repeat locus. again, identical alleles may be found elsewhere in the database , suggesting they were horizontally transferred. in our dataset, these three trst types displayed the only such discrepancies. we conclude that genetic recombination between unrelated chromosomes was involved in the evolution of maximally three trst types out of  <dig> that were included in our set of isolates. hence, the evolution of tandem repeats tr <dig> and tr <dig> is driven largely through clonal diversification, whereas the impact of recombination is extremely small. these results fully corroborate a previous estimate of a very low recombination rate in c. difficile, which had been based on mlst data  <cit> .

while tr <dig> and tr <dig> displayed remarkable sequence variation, both loci seemed sufficiently stable to identify genetically related isolates collected over time. for one, the stability of tr <dig> and tr <dig> was demonstrated by two vpi  <dig> and three  <dig> strains , that prior to our analysis each had been handled in different laboratories  and, hence, had independently been subcultured multiple times, but yet shared the same respective trst sequence types . furthermore, stability of both tandem repeat regions was circumstantially suggested through identical sequences found in multiple isolates sharing the same ribotype but originating from different geographical regions .

typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with pcr ribotyping
results were compared to pcr ribotyping on the basis of  <dig> isolates including international reference strains and clinical isolates collected at various german laboratories . these isolates had been preselected from the material available to represent maximal diversity as judged on the basis of pcr ribotyping and geographic origin. they represented  <dig> different ribotypes . figure  <dig> shows a neighbor joining dendrogram based on the repeat successions in concatenated tr <dig> and tr <dig> sequences.

all  <dig> isolates were typeable by trst. considering both, differences in length and nucleotide sequence,  <dig> distinct alleles were identified at locus tr <dig>  and  <dig> alleles at locus tr <dig> . sequencing either one of the two loci had less discriminatory power than pcr ribotyping, as reflected by slightly lower discriminatory indices . when considered in combination, however, sequence analysis of tr <dig> and tr <dig> resulted in the identification of  <dig> different trst sequence types among the  <dig> isolates investigated . this way, trst and pcr ribotyping had equal discriminatory power, reflected by identical discriminatory indices  based on the set of isolates included. it has to be considered, however, that this estimate will be skewed to some extent in favour of ribotyping, since ribotype diversity was the basis of initial isolate selection. many ribotypes were represented by single isolates, and the potential ability of trst to further discriminate within these ribotypes was thus not tested.

a adjusted rand's coefficient

b combination of sequences from tr <dig> and tr <dig> 

trst demonstrated high overall concordance with pcr ribotyping for the set of strains typed in this study, resulting in a calculated adjusted rand's index of  <dig> % . the probability that a pair of isolates with the same ribotype also shared identical trst sequence types was  <dig> % . accordingly, ribotypes usually corresponded to specific trst sequence types . for example,  <dig> isolates with ribotype  <dig>  originating from six different european countries, displayed identical sequences at tr <dig> and tr <dig> that discriminated them from all other isolates, and jointly were assigned trst sequence type tr- <dig> . similarly, four isolates with ribotype  <dig> from three different countries, including the reference strain for toxinotype viii, were assigned sequence type tr- <dig> . future work on larger numbers of isolates may reveal that sequencing a single locus  will suffice to identify epidemiologically relevant strains. for the sake of concordance with pcr ribotyping, however, we presently suggest to sequence both loci. as outlined above, this strategy will also detect the impact of recombination.

tandem repeat sequences are phylogenetically informative
discrepancies between trst and ribotyping were apparent where either method split a particular group of isolates into two or three classes, whereas the other lumped them into one . in virtually all of these cases, however, the respective isolates were affiliated to identical mlst sequence types or to single locus variants with respect to mlst , indicating their close phylogenetic relatedness. phylogenetic coherence of these additional classes will remain unclear as long as there are no phylogenetic markers available to investigate the detailed evolutionary history of c. difficile within mlst sequence types.

mlva typically resolves dozens of distinct genotypes within individual ribotypes  <cit> . however, mlva provided little insight to the genetic relatedness within our collection, since almost all isolates differed from each other at four or more loci  <cit> , even when they were affiliated to identical trst sequence types or ribotypes . the sole useful exception was represented by isolates jw <dig> and cl <dig>  which shared identical alleles at five mlva loci . the summed tandem-repeat difference between these two isolates was four repeats, which is below the threshold  previously suggested to indicate close genetic relationship based on mlva  <cit> . mlst identity confirmed the relatedness of these isolates , and their close phylogenetic relationship also was correctly reflected by identical sequences at tr <dig> and tr <dig> . however, these isolates displayed a distinct one-band difference between their ribotyping patterns, corresponding to ribotypes  <dig> and rki <dig>  respectively . this result illustrates the fact that ribotypes may differ widely with respect to the phylogenetic divergence they encompass. it may be noted that two other pairs of isolates shared highly similar mlva patterns . the summed tandem-repeat difference for the former pair is seven repeats, and hence these two isolates would be suggested to be extremely closely related based on mlva alone  <cit> . these similarities, however, clearly reflect homoplasies, since mlst indicated these isolates were entirely unrelated . thus, the application of mlva as currently used is inappropriate when attempting to resolve distant phylogenetic relationships of c. difficile isolates. again, in these cases, phylogeny was correctly indicated by trst. we therefore conclude that it may be useful to combine trst and mlva in a nested hierarchical fashion, where trst may resolve phylogenetic diversity to a level equivalent to pcr ribotypes, and mlva may add additional resolution where desired.

evolutionary relationships between isolates may be revealed through tandem repeat sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. this is also feasible for those isolates that were assigned different trst types. for example, ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> by mlst are indicated to be closely related, since corresponding isolates are assigned two mlst sequence types that differ at one locus only . close relationship of ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> previously has also been found on the basis of dna macrorestriction analysis, when isolates with both ribotypes were assigned to the 'north american pulsotype nap1'  <cit> . concordantly with mlst and macrorestriction, trst also indicated the relatedness of these types through similar tandem repeat sequences that clustered tightly in the phylogenetic tree , yet it maintained the discriminatory power of pcr ribotyping by assigning three different sequence types  . similarly, ribotypes  <dig> and rki <dig> were indicated to be closely related to ribotype  <dig> by both, mlst and trst . in contrast, these relationships were not at all apparent on the basis of ribotyping band patterns .

phylogenetic relatedness was also indicated in cases where trst was more discriminatory than pcr ribotyping. for example, ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> each were subdivided into several trst types . clusters of related tandem repeat sequences in the phylogenetic tree still corresponded to pcr ribotypes , which warrants the comparability of results from both methods. this feature may be highly desirable, since it will facilitate, for example, cross-referencing to ribotyping-based examinations and maintaining the continuity of ongoing surveillance programs.

ribotyping does not enable phylogenetic analyses based on dissimilar banding patterns, and the relatedness of different ribotypes has not commonly been assessed. in the long run, large-scale mutation discovery and genomic sequencing will reveal the phylogenetic validity of typing procedures  <cit> .

future prospects
we anticipate that pcr ribotyping will eventually be replaced by typing procedure based on dna sequences. the inherent portability of sequence data will obviate the need for the exchange of reference strains and enable decentralised genotyping efforts, which may boost large scale investigations on the molecular diversity of c. difficile. at present, however, our knowledge about the diversity and population biology of this important pathogen is very limited  <cit> . as a consequence, it is generally not clear if isolate groupings provided by various typing methods, including pcr ribotyping, are concordant with the epidemiology of associated disease  <cit> . related to these considerations, one limitation of this present study is the lack of epidemiologically linked isolates in our data set. investigations in the near future should evaluate the utility of tandem repeat sequencing for infection chain tracking and short-term epidemiological investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
sequence analysis of tandem repeats tr <dig> and tr <dig> provided full typeability across a wide range of c. difficile isolate diversity, excellent concordance with pcr ribotyping, and equal discriminatory ability. sequence clades corresponded to phylogenetically coherent groupings. this sequencing-based typing approach may prove particularly useful because dna sequences can easily be exchanged via the internet.
