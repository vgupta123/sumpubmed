BACKGROUND
by the virtue of the size of their genome and the abundance of regulatory genes, bacteria of the genus pseudomonas can adapt to a multitude of environmental niches  <cit> . in addition, they express natural resistance to β-lactamins and several disinfectants, and consequently the opportunistic behaviour of pseudomonas is problematic in hospitals  <cit> . pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the micro-organisms most commonly responsible for nosocomial diseases and other fluorescent pseudomonas also cause human infections  <cit> . some psychrotrophic species, such as pseudomonas fluorescens, which are pathogens in cold blood vertebrates  <cit> , are also cytotoxic to mammalian cells  <cit>  and can generate virulent clinical strains able to grow at 37°c  <cit> . p. fluorescens and p. aeruginosa possess a specific affinity for neurons and glial cells and their binding to the target cells is associated with apoptosis and necrosis  <cit> . the action of pseudomonas on nerve cells appears to be very specific  <cit>  and mostly mediated by the lipopolysaccharide   <cit> .

in the host, and particularly in the vicinity of nerve cells, bacteria are exposed to multitude of information molecules . the sensing of these eukaryotic signals may modulate the physiology of the bacteria and may potentially modify their cytotoxicity. indeed, the physiology and virulence of bacteria can be modulated by diverse small signal molecules such as norepinephrine  <cit> , epinephrine  <cit> , neuropeptides including somatostatin  <cit> , melanocortin peptides  <cit> , immune modulators such as dynorphin  <cit>  and interferon-γ  <cit>  and natriuretic peptides, namely the brain natriuretic peptide  and the c-type natriuretic peptide   <cit> . we demonstrated recently the existence of a putative natriuretic peptide sensor in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> . natriuretic peptides may act in this bacterium through activation of a cyclase leading to an increase in the intra-bacterial camp concentration and to stimulation of the vfr global regulator. the resulting modulation of the cytotoxicity correlates with major changes in the structure of the lps. biochemical studies revealed that lps extracted from p. fluorescens generally causes apoptosis whereas the lps purified from p. aeruginosa is a potent pro-necrosis factor  <cit> . these findings and studies of the thermoregulation of virulence  <cit>  suggest a dissociation of the apoptotic and necrotic effects of the endotoxins in the two species. p. aeruginosa and p. fluorescens are closely related, but there has been no investigation of whether p. fluorescens carries a natriuretic peptide sensor system. the results such an investigation would provide information about the probability of expression of similar systems in the group of fluorescent pseudomonas, and about interspecies factors of variability.

here, we report a study of the effects of bnp and cnp on the growth, adhesion potential and virulence of p. fluorescens in vitro using a model of primary cultures of glial cells. the variations of bacterial cytotoxicity induced by bnp and cnp were reproduced using cell permeable stable analogs of cyclic nucleotides, molecules, naturally produced in eukaryotes upon coupling of the natriuretic peptides to their receptors. we studied changes in intra-bacterial concentrations of camp and cgmp after exposure of the micro-organisms to bnp and cnp. we also investigated the effects of stable analogs of the cyclic nucleotides on the cytotoxicity and chemical properties of bacterial lps.

RESULTS
in our experimental conditions at 28°c, pseudomonas fluorescens mf <dig> multiplied rapidly, following an exponential growth curve until reaching stationary phase  <dig> hours after the beginning of the experiment. addition of bnp or cnp  at the onset of the incubation or at the beginning of the stationary phase did not modify the general profile of the growth curve or the mean time required for doubling of the bacterial population. similarly, the cultivability and colony forming potential of p. fluorescens mf <dig> on solid substrate was unchanged by exposure of the bacteria to bnp or cnp  .

effect of pre-treatment with natriuretic peptides on the potential of pseudomonas fluorescens mf <dig> to provoke apoptosis in glial cells
the spontaneous nitrite  synthase activity of pseudomonas fluorescens mf <dig> is very low ; consequently, as previously demonstrated  <cit> , no2- ions detected in the medium of cultures of glial cells exposed to p. fluorescens mf <dig> result from eukaryotic no synthases activated during the induction of the apoptotic death of the glial cells. the concentration of no-  <dig> in the medium following incubation of glial cells with p. fluorescens mf <dig> reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . pre-treatment of p. fluorescens with natriuretic peptides  significantly decreased their capacity to provoke no synthesis by glial cells: the no-  <dig> concentration for bacteria exposed to bnp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  and for those exposed to cnp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  .

effect of pre-treatment of pseudomonas fluorescens mf <dig> by natriuretic peptides on its potential to provoke necrosis in glial cells
lactate dehydrogenase  is a stable cytosolic enzyme in eukaryotic cells and is totally absent from the medium when pseudomonas fluorescens mf <dig> is incubated alone ; it can thus serve as a marker of eukaryotic cell lysis. when glial cells were incubated alone a small amount of ldh was recovered in the medium consistent with only a small proportion of the population  undergoing necrosis during the incubation period of  <dig> h. this indicates the good health and quality of the glial cell cultures. glial cells were then exposed to p. fluorescens mf <dig> : the percentage of the cell population affected by necrosis reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %. pre-treatment of p. fluorescens with bnp or cnp  resulted in a significant increase in the number glial cells affected by necrosis:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for bacteria exposed to bnp   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for bacteria treated with cnp  .

effect of pre-treatment of pseudomonas fluorescens mf <dig> by stable analogues of camp and cgmp on its potential to provoke apoptosis and necrosis
the cytotoxicity of p. fluorescens was investigated after exposure of the bacteria to dibutyryl cyclic amp  or 8-bromo-cyclic gmp  , two cell-permeable stable analogues of cyclic amp and cyclic gmp. as observed using natriuretic peptides, pre-treatment of p. fluorescens with dbcamp or 8bcgmp  significantly decreased their capacity to provoke no synthesis by glial cells: the no-  <dig> concentration for bacteria exposed to dbcamp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  and for those exposed to 8bcgmp was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  . in contrast, a similar pre-treatment with dbcamp or 8bcgmp increased the necrotic potential of the bacteria by + <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and + <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, respectively, of the control value  .

pre-treatment of p. fluorescens mf <dig> with bnp, cnp , dbcamp or 8bcgmp  did not significantly modify the binding of bacteria to glial cells .

effect of bnp and cnp on intra-bacterial cyclic amp and cyclic gmp concentrations
the concentration of cyclic amp  in p. fluorescens mf <dig> in late exponential phase was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/ml. when p. fluorescens was incubated with bnp  the concentration of camp increased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/ml  . cnp  had no significant effect  on the intra-bacterial concentration of camp in p. fluorescens. the concentration of cyclic gmp  in p. fluorescens mf <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/ml, and thus lower than that of camp; furthermore, this value was in the same range as the sensitivity of the assay. bnp  did not significantly modify the cgmp concentration in p. fluorescens, whereas cnp  caused an increase to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol/ml of cgmp  .

effects of stable analogues of camp and cgmp on the cytotoxicity of the lipopolysaccharide of pseudomonas fluorescens mf37
lps makes a large contribution to the cytotoxicity of pseudomonas on glial cells  <cit> . we therefore evaluated the effects of stable analogues of cyclic nucleotides on lps activity. the cytotoxicity of the lps from p. fluorescens exposed to dibutyryl cyclic amp  or 8-bromo-cyclic gmp   was compared to that of the lps from control bacteria taken at the same stage of growth . lps from control and pre-treated bacteria were extracted and their concentrations were determined by a kdo assay. the mean concentrations of lps samples from bacterial cultures grown in the absence  or presence of camp or cgmp  were all in the same range. equivalent aliquots were added to the culture medium  of glial cells and cytotoxicity was determined, as previously described, by measurement of the concentration of no-  <dig>  and by measurement of ldh release . when glial cells were exposed to lps extracted from control p. fluorescens mf <dig>  the no-  <dig> concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm ; the value obtained for lps from p. fluorescens exposed to dbcamp was significantly higher  at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm   whereas that for lps from p. fluorescens exposed to 8bcgmp was not significantly different to the value for lps from control mf <dig> . necrosis in glial cell cultures, in this series of experiments, affected  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the control cell population in  <dig> h  . for glial cells exposed to lps extracted from control p. fluorescens mf <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of the cells displayed signs of necrosis. for glial cells treated with lps from mf <dig> exposed to dbcamp,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %  of the cell population was affected by necrosis . in contrast, lps from mf <dig> exposed to 8bcgmp did not cause significantly more necrosis than control lps . control tests with extracts of nutrient broth medium  obtained using the same lps extraction and purification protocols indicated that the effect of the lps on glial cell viability was not due to contaminants from the extraction buffers employed for purification .

effect of stable analogues of camp and cgmp on the structure of the lipopolysaccharide of pseudomonas fluorescens mf37
lps extracted and purified from p. fluorescens mf <dig> was analysed by micellar electrokinetic chromatography , a technique that allows the separation of non-volatile macro-molecules showing small differences of size and polarity with an efficiency in the same range as gas chromatography  <cit> . the lps of p. fluorescens mf <dig> grown in control conditions gave numerous peaks . peaks a and b were minor peaks with retention times of  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, respectively, each apparently corresponding to a single molecular form. peak c was larger, with a retention time of  <dig>  min and corresponding to a series of compounds with very closely related structures. peak d was broad, with a retention time between  <dig>  and  <dig>  min and presented a large variety of molecular forms . peaks e and f were high and thin, with retention times of  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, respectively. the electropherograms of lps extracted from p. fluorescens mf <dig> treated with dbcamp and 8bcgmp  presented marked differences, although the same major peaks  were detected in all electropherograms . the major difference between lps extracted from control and dbcamp-treated bacteria was the smaller number of molecular forms after dbcamp treatment : the broad spectrum of compounds  was substantially smaller whereas a new peak  appeared ; the composition of compounds corresponding to the broad peak  appeared to be different and a new peak  appeared, corresponding to a weakly retained molecular form . the structure of the lps extracted from 8bcgmp-treated bacteria was also different: a broad signal  corresponding to numerous new strongly retained compounds was found ; in contrast as observed with dbcamp-treated lps, a compound eluting as peak b was detected.

discussion
we first tested for any direct antibacterial effect of the natriuretic peptides bnp and cnp on pseudomonas fluorescens. the concentration of the natriuretic peptides was that usually employed to investigate the physiological activity of these molecules in eukaryotic cells  <cit>  and identical to that previously tested on p. aeruginosa  <cit> . because the cultivation method can greatly influence the survival of bacteria  <cit> , we decided to distinguish between possible effects of bnp and cnp on growth on liquid and solid substrates. bacterial growth curves and counting demonstrated that bnp and cnp had no effect on the growth or cultivability of p. fluorescens in our experimental conditions. this finding diverges from those of previous studies showing an antimicrobial activity of bnp  <cit>  and suggesting a similar effect of cnp  <cit> . however, the previously described activity of bnp appeared essentially targeted towards gram-positive bacteria; the minimum inhibitory concentration of bnp for pseudomonas was  <dig> times that employed in our experiments  <cit> . other than the structural homologies with anti-microbial peptides, the only reason for suspecting that cnp expresses bactericidal activity is that it can form channels in artificial lipid bilayers  <cit> . however, artificial membranes made of pure phospholipids are very different to the double and lps-decorated membranes of gram-negative bacteria. moreover, in physiological conditions cnp is probably not present in sufficient concentrations to act as an ionophore.

as these natriuretic peptides were without effect on the survival of p. fluorescens, we used a well-characterised model of glial cell infection  <cit>  to investigate the effect of bnp and cnp on the virulence of the bacteria. p. fluorescens was incubated with one or other natriuretic peptide during exponential growth, rinsed and then added to primary cultures of glial cells. thus, eukaryotic cells were never exposed to the peptides and the effects observed can only result from changes in the virulence of the bacteria. we first showed that treatment of p. fluorescens by bnp and cnp decreased its apoptotic effect on glial cells. this suggests that the natriuretic peptides altered the bacterial physiology sufficiently to modify the production of virulence factors without affecting growth and survival. this is in agreement with studies showing that anti-microbial substances can exert other effects on bacterial physiology or on toxins without inhibiting the survival of the micro-organism  <cit> . also, as described for p. aeruginosa  <cit> , bnp and cnp treatment of p. fluorescens increased its necrotic activity. necrosis is due to disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane, generally due to enzymatic activities, whereas apoptosis is a process induced by the production of cell death messengers. we have previously shown that the two mechanisms are differently regulated by p. fluorescens  <cit> . as suggested by jungas et al.  <cit>  a rapid and strong induction of necrosis can mask other apoptotic processes. indeed, in our experimental conditions, the increase in nos activity appears only  <dig> hours after the initial contact between glial cells and bacteria, whereas ldh release was markedly increased within  <dig> hours . this necrosis may be triggered by bacterial secretion of cytotoxic enzymes or virulence factors. in support of this hypothesis it was recently shown that mfn  <dig>  a clinical strain of p. fluorescens  <cit> , secrets extracellular factors, including a phospholipase c, with lytic potential in the same range as that of p. aeruginosa  <cit> . note that the increase of bacterial virulence due to treatment by natriuretic peptides was not associated with an increase in bacterial adhesion to the target cells and therefore does not appear to be contact mediated. nevertheless, variations in the efficiency of toxin translocation through a type iii secretion system would also explain our results; p. aeruginosa expresses a type iii secretion system  <cit> , but no such system in p. fluorescens mf <dig> has been described.

in order to go further into the mechanism involved in the modulation of p. fluorescens cytotoxicity by natriuretic peptides, we studied the effects of stable analogues of cyclic nucleotide monophosphate. we used cell-permeable stable analogues of cgmp and camp as tools to explore the action of bnp and cnp in p. fluorescens, in view of possible analogy with the mechanisms of action of natriuretic peptides in eukaryotes. indeed, in these cells the effects of natriuretic peptides are mediated by three different receptor subtypes, npr-a, npr-b and/or npr-c which are all associated with adenylate or guanylate cyclase activities  <cit> . we observed that exposure of p. fluorescens to 8-bromo-cyclic gmp  and dibutyryl cyclic amp  fully reproduced the dual effect of bnp and cnp, i.e. a decrease of apoptosis and an increase of necrosis. the involvement of camp in the regulation of host-directed virulence factors, through the camp binding protein vfr, has been demonstrated for p. aeruginosa  <cit> , but the effects of cgmp were unknown until now. in p. aeruginosa, the vfr protein may be activated by both camp and cgmp, as vfr is unlikely to discriminate between the two types of cyclic nucleotide  <cit> . note that a cyclic nucleotide recognition module, called "gaf" and present in a wide range of species from bacteria to human, has been described  <cit> . this module binds both camp and cgmp and it is possible that some cyclic nucleotide binding proteins in bacteria do not discriminate between the two types of cyclic nucleotide mono-phosphate. the involvement of a cyclic nucleotide-dependent cascade in the action of natriuretic peptides in p. fluorescens was confirmed by a direct assay of camp and cgmp: bnp provoked a significant rise in the camp concentration in the bacterial stroma but was without effect on cgmp. conversely, cnp induced an increase of the intra-bacterial concentration of cgmp but not that of camp. these findings are noticeably different from those for p. aeruginosa in which bnp has no effect on the camp concentration  <cit> . thus, it is suggesting that the sensitivity to natriurectic peptides diverges between pseudomonas species. p. fluorescens and p. aeruginosa therefore have different responses to bnp and cnp and consequently it is likely that there are at least two forms of putative natriuretic-peptide sensor in pseudomonas species. consistent with this notion, the bacterium helicobacter pylori can recognise only one of the subtypes of the somatostatin receptor agonists and thus displays highly stereospecific recognition of this eukaryotic messenger  <cit> . here, we demonstrate for the first time, that cgmp, a ubiquitous eukaryotic second messenger, is involved in the regulation of an intra-bacterial transduction signal. this illustrates the remarkable analogy between the effects of natriuretic peptides in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. the number of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases identified in bacteria is now substantial  <cit>  and is consistent with our observations: bacterial cyclase may be involved in the response of p. fluorescens to natriuretic peptides suggesting that in addition to the well-characterised bacterial second messenger, cyclic di-gmp  <cit> , cyclic monophosphate nucleotides may play crucial roles in the integration of environmental signals transmitted from the bacterial surface.

the pseudomonas endotoxin, lps, is a major virulence factor released upon bacterial death, but can also be produced as vesicular forms by living bacteria  <cit> . the composition of the lps produced by p. fluorescens can change rapidly under stress conditions  <cit> . we studied the effects of the stable and cell-permeable analogues of cyclic nucleotide monophosphate on the cytotoxic activities and chemical properties of the lps. it would have been preferable to use the natriuretic peptides themselves but the cost was prohibitive in regard of their consumption by such experiments that require producing massive concentrations of lps. modifications of the lps structure are directly associated with differences in its pro-necrotic activity  <cit> , but did not affect the pro-apoptotic effect of the endotoxin . thus, endotoxin-induced cell death may be ascribed to at least two distinct processes. bacterial-induced cell death is undoubtedly even more complex as it may involve not only apoptosis and necrosis, but also from the more recently described pyroptotic system  <cit> ; furthermore, a single factor or micro-organism can simultaneously induce different death types  <cit> . this and previous works with p. fluorescens  <cit>  suggest that the expression of the lps components involved in the initiation of necrosis may be regulated through a camp-dependent intra-bacterial pathway, whereas pro-apoptotic factors are regulated by a different mechanism. as observed in p. aeruginosa  <cit> , greater cytotoxicity of the lps appeared to be associated with a decrease in the diversity of the lps isoforms. further investigations will be necessary to confirm if the lipid a part of the lps from p. fluorescens, like its counterpart in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> , is the target of the modification associated with the intra-bacterial cyclic nucleotide concentration.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate the existence of a natriuretic peptide sensor mechanism in pseudomonas fluorescens and the involvement of cyclase in the response to bnp and cnp. for the first time we report that cgmp, in addition to cyclic di-gmp and camp, may be involved in the coupling of the bacterial response to specific extracellular messengers. this work opens a wide range of possibilities for research concerning the reasons for preservation – or common emergence – of a natriuretic peptide-dependent receptor/sensor system during evolution in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. studies of the physiological role of natriuretic peptides in bacteria will undoubtedly be informative. our work also suggests that the number of sensor or communication molecules recognised by gram-negative bacteria has been probably substantially underestimated.
