BACKGROUND
in the last decade, light has been picked up as signal to control cellular behavior taking advantage of natural or engineered photoreceptors that regulate the activity of diverse output domains. this research field is called optogenetics and has recently attracted attention due to the unmatched characteristics of light as signaling entity, mainly the application of light with high temporal and spatial control  <cit> . the increasing importance of optogenetics for biomedical research is reflected in the development of diverse tools like microbial rhodopsins to control the nervous system of higher eukaryotes, usage of phytochromes and cryptochromes to control transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, light oxygen voltage  <dig>  domain-based control of a small gtpase or a formin, and the usage of the lov <dig> domain or phytochromes to control protein localization  <cit> . especially the lov <dig> domain, which originates from plant phototropins, has been selected repeatedly as a tool to establish light-control of protein activity  <cit> . the lov <dig> domain consists of a core domain with a per-arnt-sim fold, which binds flavin mononucleotide  noncovalently as cofactor. an amphipathic helix named the jα helix follows c-terminally to the core domain after a short loop consisting of a few residues  <cit> . the jα helix is additionally linked to the core by a series of noncovalent interactions involving hydrophobic as well as polar amino acids  <cit> . blue-light exposure of a lov <dig> domain induces excitation of the fmn cofactor, which leads to the formation of a covalent cysteinyl-flavin c4a adduct that results in a conformational change of the core domain, detachment of the jα helix from the core and subsequent unfolding of the helix  <cit> . this light-induced reaction takes place in the arabidopsis thaliana lov <dig> domain on a very short time-scale. the time constants have been measured to be 2 μs for photon absorption and adduct formation, 1 ms for the subsequent unfolding of the jα helix, and about 70 s for the reversion to the dark state. the latter conversion includes transition of fmn to the ground state and refolding of the jα helix  <cit> . dark state reversion varies widely between different lov domains with timescales spanning from seconds to days  <cit> , which has been in the focus of many studies aiming to uncover the structural features responsible for the differences in reversion kinetics. these efforts led to the identification of several residues in the core domain close to the fmn cofactor that influence reversion to the dark state  <cit> . in addition, the jα helix has been recognized as a region, which is important for the light-reaction of lov <dig> domains. using the avena sativa lov <dig> domain, it was shown that amino acid exchanges within the helix alter the signaling characteristics and affect both, the behavior in darkness as well as the behavior upon blue-light illumination  <cit> . pseudo-lit-state mutants that show constant jα helix undocking have been obtained by mutating residues in the jα helix and residues near the n-terminus of the lov <dig> domain  <cit> . the benefit of these efforts was information how lov <dig> domains sense light and respond to it as well as the ability to change the light-response of optogenetic tools based on this widely used domain  <cit> . recently, the structure of the a. thaliana phototropin <dig> lov <dig> domain has been published. strikingly, the jα helix seems to comprise more residues compared to the homologous lov <dig> domain from avena sativa  <cit> .

most mutant variants of the lov <dig> domain that increase the dissociation of the jα helix from the core domain have been obtained by strategies, which favor the recovery of pseudo-lit state mutants  <cit> . however, it is desirable to obtain mutants that react profoundly to low amounts of light, but have in darkness a tight association of the helix to the core domain. such mutants might be less important for constructs inducing site-specific activation of effector proteins on a short time-scale like photo-activatable rac or photo-activatable formin  <cit> , but are certainly interesting for applications that require long exposure to blue light as it is the case in optogenetic control of gene expression or of protein stability  <cit>  to minimize the possibility of adverse effects due to long blue-light expositions of cells.

control over protein stability has been achieved with the photo-sensitive degron  module. it allows destabilization of selected proteins upon blue-light illumination by fusing it to the carboxy-terminal end of the target. it is composed of the arabidopsis thaliana phototropin <dig> lov <dig> domain and a synthetic degradation sequence  called codc <dig> that has been derived from the carboxy-terminal degron of murine ornithine decarboxylase . the odc degron consists of a stretch of  <dig> amino acids without secondary structure and a cysteine-alanine motif, which is essential for activity of the degron. the cysteine has been shown to be required for proteasomal association, and has to be  <dig> amino acids away from the carboxy terminus of the protein  <cit> . in the psd module, a  <dig> amino acid long synthetic variant of the odc degron has been fused directly to the end of the lov <dig> jα helix. this engineered degron is inactive in darkness due to the helical fold upstream of the cysteine-alanine motif and is activated by jα helix unfolding. the psd module has been used to regulate diverse cellular functions in saccharomyces cerevisiae by light  <cit> ; a similar construct has been developed recently for usage in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . here, we report the generation of photo-sensitive degron module variants that are useful to tune protein stability over a broad range with blue light. we characterized the impact of mutations in the lov <dig> domain described in the literature as well as mutations obtained by random mutagenesis. in vivo and in silico characterization of the variants demonstrated that we obtained psd modules with increased degradation rate and higher dark/light ratio. thus, we obtained psd modules that differ profoundly in their dynamic characteristics and will facilitate light-driven depletion of selected target proteins.

RESULTS
variants of the psd module with changed light-reactivity
we aimed to obtain psd module variants with increased destabilizing activity at a blue light illumination intensity that does not influence the growth rate of yeast cells . even, yap <dig> mutant cells that have been reported to be very light-sensitive  <cit> , are still able to grow under these conditions, although slower than wild type cells . different approaches were taken to obtain improved psd module variants: firstly, mutations that are known to change the characteristics of homologous lov domains were selected and introduced into the psd module . domain swapping between two closely related lov <dig> domains has demonstrated that the jα helix region caused differences in dark-state recovery  <cit> . thus, we selected mostly mutants within the jα helix. this approach yielded the mutants v19i, g138a, e139n, and n148e, which correspond to the aslov <dig> mutants v416i, g528a, v529n, and n538e  <cit> . please note that the numbering of the psd module mutants starts at the methionine of the atlov <dig> domain in the psd module; additional file 1: table s <dig> gives an overview of the mutants and the numbering of the residues in the full length a. thaliana phototropin <dig> figure  <dig> 
strategy to obtain psd module variants. a) site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate mutants within the jα helix. after verification of the construct, yeast cells were transformed with the novel plasmid and subjected to cycloheximide chase analysis. b) screening procedure to obtain mutants with altered psd module-characteristics. the plasmids pct <dig> and pds <dig> were used as template during random mutagenesis of the lov2-codc <dig> construct. the pcr products were combined with linearized vector  and ligated in yeast by homologous recombination. the yeast clones were grown in darkness on selective solid medium, duplicated and either exposed to blue light or kept in darkness. the rfp fluorescence intensity of each clone was obtained for each condition. clones with a promising dark/light ratio were selected for patch assays in comparison with the psd module  as well as a negative control  after growth in darkness and under blue light. at least four independent measurements were performed for each clone . c) sequence alignment of jα helix-forming residues of lov <dig> domains from different phototropins: a. thaliana phot <dig> , z. mays phototropin- <dig> , a. capillus phototropin , v. faba phototropin , p. sativum pspk <dig> , a. sativa nph <dig> , and o. sativa nph <dig>  were created with the software clustalx. the secondary structure of a. thaliana lov <dig> is shown on top  and the one of a. sativa  below the alignment. the numbering follows the sequence of the psd module. the grade of conservation of an amino acid is indicated using the clustalx convention. residues, which are mutated in psd module variants, are indicated by a red box.



secondly, a random mutagenesis was performed using the psd module and the n148e variant as templates to create a library of plasmids by in yeast ligation. the n148e mutant was chosen in addition to the wild type psd construct because the corresponding mutant in aslov <dig>  was reported to have reduced jα helix unfolding in darkness  <cit> , which might be helpful in obtaining a psd module variant with increased dark/light ratio. in these constructs, the red fluorescence protein  was fused to the amino-terminal end of the psd module as reporter domain. the plasmid library was screened for yeast colonies that showed robust rfp fluorescence after growth in darkness and loss of fluorescence when exposed to blue light. this procedure yielded the mutants v142g, k92r e132a n148d e155g, and k121m n128y n148e .

finally, we created variants by site-directed mutagenesis combining single mutations or changing residues in the jα helix. our aim was to destabilize the psd module in blue light without affecting its stability in darkness. our main criteria was to combine mutations that produced interesting results during the first round of characterization and to generate mutants within the jα helix that disfavor an α-helical conformation. for the latter attempt, experimentally obtained helix propensity values were used  <cit>  to select amino acid exchanges that result in altered helix propensity, but do not disturb other characteristics profoundly. we made an alignment of the jα helix region from a. thaliana lov <dig> with homologous proteins to indicate all mutagenized residues in relation to conserved features. moreover, the alignment demonstrates that in phototropins the loop connecting the core domain with the jα helix is quite variable in sequence . remarkably, this loop of about  <dig> amino acids  is not fully resolved in the structure of the atlov <dig> domain  <cit> .

so far, all the psd module variants contained the synthetic codc <dig> sequence, which might differ in its degron activity from the native murine odc degron. thus, we created a psd module variant with the last  <dig> amino acids of the carboxy terminus of murine ornithine decarboxylase  fused to the atlov <dig> domain instead of the  <dig> amino acids long synthetic codc <dig> sequence used in the psd module. as in the original construct, the unfolding of the lov <dig> jα helix is expected to complete the necessary number of unfolded amino acids required to induce proteasomal degradation. in addition, we tried to increase proteasomal association of the psd module upon activation by blue light. to do so, we multiplied the cysteine-alanine motif within the codc <dig> sequence to have a double  or triple  motif. in total, we analyzed  <dig> variants of the psd module for their stability in darkness or under blue light in yeast cells using cycloheximide chase analysis . in this assay, the translational inhibitor cycloheximide was used to stop protein synthesis, which allowed us to follow the stability of a selected protein over time by western blotting. we found that the psd module variants were present in yeast cells in good amounts and showed robust light-response, which indicates that the variants were able to fold properly.figure  <dig>

-rfp-psd  or the variants k121m n128y g138a and k92r e132a e155g were grown in liquid medium in darkness. after removal of the first sample , cycloheximide  was added to stop protein synthesis; cells were kept in the dark  or exposed to blue light  for the rest of the experiment. equal amounts of sample were collected at the indicated time points and subjected to alkaline lysis and western blotting. b) quantification of the immunoblots shown in a. curves are the means obtained from at least four independent measurements . the half-lives  that are indicated next to each curve were obtained by fitting the data to an exponential decay using the software origin  <dig> 



characterization of psd module variants
we quantified the western blots for each variant and fitted the curves to a first order exponential decay to obtain the half-lives in darkness and blue light . the observed half-lives in light ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min  to 75 ± 14 min  compared to 20 ± 1 min measured for the wild type psd module. in total,  <dig> of the variants showed a significant reduction in stability and four constructs were stabilized compared to the original construct. in darkness, we obtained values from 14 ± 2 min  to 187 ± 45 min , while we found a half-life of 123 ± 21 min in the wild type psd construct. we measured several psd module variants at very low amounts of blue light  and observed qualitatively similar results . for most constructs, the half-lives were somewhat prolonged and ranged from 24 ±  <dig> to 40 ± 3 min at 5 μmol m−2 s− <dig>  compared to  <dig> to 22 min at 30 μmol m−2 s− <dig> in these constructs . however, we identified five mutants that showed almost no difference between the two illumination conditions. we measured half-lives between  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and 13 ± 1 min in the k121m n128y, k92r e132a e155g, g138a v142a r154g e155s, and k121m n128y g138a variants at 5 μmol m−2 s− <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and 13 ± 1 min in the same mutants at 30 μmol m−2 s− <dig>  in the v19i variant, we observed have half-lives of 17 min at both illumination conditions. this mutation corresponds to the a. sativa lov <dig> mutation v416i, which has been shown to prolong the dark state recovery time  <cit> . thus, the high degradation rate at 5 μmol m−2 s− <dig> in the variants k121m n128y, k92r e132a e155g, g138a v142a r154g e155s, and k121m n128y g138a might be caused by prolonged dark-state recovery, either induced by changes of the photocycle or extended jα helix refolding time. remarkably, the psd module variant k121m n128y has a half-life more than  <dig> times lower than the original construct at 5 μmol m−2 s− <dig> . the four variants k121m n128y, k92r e132a e155g, g138a v142a r154g e155s, and k121m n128y g138a were obtained in the second round of psd module variant generation, in which stabilizing and destabilizing mutations were mixed in an attempt to optimize the constructs.table  <dig>

next, the in vivo ratio of the abundance of the psd module variants in darkness and exposed to blue light was measured. we selected psd module variants with short half-life under blue light and at least moderate stability in darkness. the highest ratios were found in two mutants, k92r e132a e155g and k121m n128y g138a. for both variants, the ratio was more than two times higher than in the wild type psd module. in the four variants k92r e132a n139e n148d e155g, k121m n128y, g138a v142a r154g e155s, and n148e r154g e155s, we observed a moderate increase  in the dark/light ratio . interestingly, all four variants with decreased stability at low illumination intensity  show also an increase in dark/light ratio. the in vivo measurements highlighted the variants k92r e132a e155g and k121m n128y g138a, which showed the highest dark/light switching factor and a faster degradation rate after blue-light illumination than the original construct . these two variants can be expected to be highly useful for in vivo manipulation of protein abundance by light.figure  <dig> 
dark/light ratio of psd module variant abundance. the protein levels of psd module variants were measured in yeast cells grown in darkness or exposed to blue light  for  <dig>  hours by fluorimeter measurements. plasmid encoded constructs were used for the in vivo measurements; all variants were derived from the psd module construct padh1
-rfp-psd. at least six independent measurements were performed for each construct. error bars: s.e.m.; mean values with a statistically significant difference  to the mean value of the wild type psd module are indicated by an asterisk.



the variants with short half-life under blue light showed increased turnover in darkness as well. we measured the impact of the odc-like degron on protein stability in the variants k92r e132a e155g, k121m n128y, k121m n128y g138a, and g138a v142a r154g e155s by mutating the essential cysteine  in the codc <dig> degron. this resulted in profound stabilization in all variants under blue light  and in darkness , especially the k121m n128y g138a variant showed almost complete stabilization. this indicates that the stability in the tested psd module variants depends mostly on codc <dig> degron presentation.

most of the psd module variants that we characterized followed a simple relation: the lower the in vivo stability in darkness, the lower the half-life in cells exposed to blue light . notably, several psd module variants  have similar half-lives in darkness , but different stability under blue light . this might indicate a very low rate of degron presentation in darkness in these variants, which results in a similar protein turnover rate.figure  <dig> 
overview of the characteristics of psd module variants. the half-life in darkness was plotted against the blue-light value for each construct .



the mutant with the shortest half-life  does not seem to be particular useful in practical terms due to the very low half-life in darkness. the average half-life of all yeast proteins is 43 min  <cit> , which means that most yeast proteins would be destabilized already in darkness if tagged with this psd module variant. also attempts to stabilize this mutant  were only partially successful in darkness , whereas they retained their short half-life in blue light . the triple mutant n148e r154g e155s is affected in darkness and blue light  and has characteristics that are shifted towards the psd module. this series of variants demonstrates that it is possible to tune psd module stability to desired values with appropriate combinations of destabilizing and stabilizing mutations. similar strategies are feasible for other optogenetic tools using the lov <dig> domain as well.

the mutant k121m n128y, which was derived from a mutant  that was picked-up by random mutagenesis, showed a pronounced impact on the stability of the psd module in darkness  and under blue light . interestingly, the k121m n128y mutations map to the loop that connects the jα helix with the lov <dig> core domain. this region is very variable among plant lov <dig> domains, demonstrated by lack of residue conservation . based on statistical coupling analysis, it has been proposed that this loop is a functional sector in the lov domain family that may induce phenotypic variation  <cit> . the t517v loop mutation in aslov <dig> showed an unaltered photocycle but increased conformational change upon illumination  <cit> . it may be of interest to study the impact of mutations in this loop in plant lov <dig> domains in detail.

mutations corresponding to g138a and n148e have been found to increase the dynamic range of the avena sativa lov <dig> domain by stabilizing the docking of the jα helix to the core  <cit> . we found qualitatively similar effects in the psd module containing the a. thaliana lov <dig> domain . especially, the g138a mutation in atlov <dig> seems to reduce unfolding of the jα helix in darkness, as has been observed for aslov <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, two mutants with very pronounced impact on psd module characteristics had both amino acid exchanges at the c-terminal border of the jα helix. we found strong destabilization for the r154g e155s variant  and pronounced stabilization for the Δl <dig> Δp <dig> mutant . this indicates sensitivity of this region towards changes in the amino acid composition. a possible explanation might be that interactions between these residues and amino acids of the core domain stabilize the jα helix in the docked conformation. the crystal structure of aslov <dig>  <cit>  shows that the side chain of l <dig> is about  <dig> to 5 Å away from y <dig> and f <dig>  which is a distance sufficient for mutual interaction. strickland and colleagues reported that the aslov <dig> y508k mutant shows slightly increased undocking of the helix in the dark compared to the wild type  <cit> , whereas an exchange  in the residue that precedes f <dig> results in a shortened photocycle lifetime and an increased conformational change  <cit> .

we designed three mutants  that were expected to destabilize the jα helix due to changes in helix propensity. we anticipated that this should impact the behavior of the psd module in darkness and in blue light. however, we did not find a pronounced effect on the half-life of the psd module under blue light . in accordance with this, we did not observe a correlation of helix propensity values with half-life in darkness or under blue light analyzing all psd module variants with mutations in the jα helix . this might indicate that electrostatic interactions of the residues between each other and with residues of the core domain are more important for the stability of the helix than the helix propensity values of the helix residues. this is in agreement with findings from analysis of aslov <dig> mutants, which implied that electrostatic interactions are important for the photoresponse of the protein  <cit> . site directed exchanges in the degron part of the psd module did not result in a dramatic change of the psd module behavior. the cacaca mutant showed a decrease in half-life to 16 ± 1 min, whereas the caca and the degodc variants were similar to the wild type psd module , although all three mutants showed decreased stability in darkness .

simulation of psd module behavior
previously, we used the computer-aided design software tinkercell  <cit>  to generate a model that simulated the behavior of the psd module  <cit> . among other things, the simulation and analysis functions of tinkercell can be used to predict the steady state levels of proteins within a model or simulate dynamic behavior of a system after an initial change of parameters. the model of the psd module includes a protein synthesis part  simulating the production of the photo-sensitive degron module protein , light-driven conversion of the lov <dig> dark-state to the lit-state , reversion back to the dark state , light-independent conversion to the lit-state , endogenous protein degradation  of psd, and light-induced protein degradation  of psd. the differential equations of the model, which we used to simulate psd module behavior, are given in additional file 1: figure s5a. in summary, the model simulates the synthesis and degradation of psd in yeast cells. comparison of the simulated levels of psd with in vivo measurements of rfp-psd abundance were in good accordance, the simulations recapitulated quite well the light-response, kinetics of protein depletion, and the difference between abundance in darkness and under blue light illumination  <cit> .

to gain a better quantitative understanding of the novel psd module variants, the conversion constants kdark, kleak, kdeglov, and kdegendo were derived from simulations matching the experimentally derived curves . we assumed that all mutants have unchanged quantum yields, which was justified by the localization of the mutations that are far from the residues involved in fmn binding. however, we cannot formally exclude that for some mutants the quantum yield might be slightly altered. the experimental data obtained by the cycloheximide chases provided more data points than free parameters in all numerical computations. however the experimental data alone did not guarantee parameter estimates with tight error ranges. a priori information about biological-meaningful parameter ranges was available from the cycloheximide chase experiments  and literature  <cit> . according to the bayesian approach this information must be taken into account. indeed, a priori information  together with the experimental data resulted in parameter estimates presented in additional file 1: table s <dig> with tight error ranges. for the psd module itself, changes were only allowed in kdeglov and kdegendo, whereas kleak and kdark were derived from literature  <cit> . parameter estimation using the curves obtained at light fluxes of  <dig>   <dig> and 30 μmol m−2 s− <dig> resulted in values for kdeglov and kdegendo very close to previously obtained results  <cit> . we simulated the impact of increased kdeglov and decreased kdark in cycloheximide chases compared to simulations with the values obtained for the wild type psd module . an increase in kdeglov led to slightly faster degradation in darkness and visibly accelerated decay at  <dig> and 30 μmol m−2 s− <dig> . this graph resembled the experimental data obtained for the variants k92r e132a n148d e155g or k92r e132a n148d e155g . a decrease in kdark resulted in a graph that had almost no difference between the two illumination conditions and moderate increase in degradation in darkness . this is similar to the data obtained from the mutants v19i, k121m n128y, k121m n128y g138a, k92r e132a e155g or g138a v142a r154g e155s .

simulations with the estimated psd module parameters showed that 67% of the molecules occupy the lit state at 30 μmol m−2 s− <dig> blue light, 26% at 5 μmol m−2 s− <dig> and  <dig> % in darkness . this indicated that at blue light fluxes, which did not affect growth of yeast cells , only a fraction of the molecules is destabilized due to degron activation. the conversion constants obtained from the parameter estimation suggested that for some of the psd module variants a higher lit state fraction might be reached. examples are the psd module variants v19i, k92r e132a e155g, k121m n128y, k121m n128y g138a, and r154g e155s, in which low values for kdark and kleak were estimated .

we simulated the behavior of the psd module using the full model, which includes protein production and degradation . we were interested to model the kinetics of psd module variant depletion at a light flux of 30 μmol m−2 s− <dig>  the absolute change of psdtotal numbers was predicted to be higher for the psd module than for most variants with decreased half-life, but these variants reached lower molecule numbers  much faster  upon illumination than wild type psd. as expected, slower depletion kinetics were predicted for variants with higher half-life . in summary, the simulations demonstrated that the novel psd module variants can be used to influence target protein levels by light within a wide range. most likely, variants with decreased half-life are of greater interest, but the variants give also the possibility to tag two or more target proteins with different psd modules and reach different target protein levels using only one signal.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
our mutational approach to improve the psd module resulted not only in variants with decreased stability, but these variants showed a higher dark/light switching ratio as well. our characterization of a set of psd module variants and subsequent in silico analysis complements previous studies using the light-regulated trp repressor lovtap, the photo-controlled kinase yf <dig>  and measurements in single lov <dig> domains  <cit> .

the novel variants of the photo-sensitive degron module show protein turnover rates that are similar to half-lives that have been measured with other degrons used for induced protein degradation. in yeast, the half-life of murine odc degron fused to a mutant titin was determined to be about 6 min  <cit> , similar to the psd module variants with shortest half-life. a faster degradation rate has been measured with an n-degron generated by the ubiquitin fusion technique; an exposed n-terminal arginine induced the degradation of a tester protein with a half-life of about 2 minutes  <cit> . for the temperature-sensitive degron, which uses an arginine as n-degron as well  <cit> , similar half-lives can be expected in the best case. another well-developed method is the plant auxin-inducible degron  system for non-plant cells  <cit> . in yeast, half-lives of about 11 minutes have been determined with this system, measurements in mammalian cells resulted in half-lives between  <dig> and 18 minutes for different target proteins  <cit> . the novel psd module variants reported here showed half-lives that are comparable with the ones of established methods, which are commonly used to degrade target proteins using different signals for induction. the usage of the photo-sensitive degron requires c-terminal fusions to target proteins, which is imposed by the choosen degradation sequence and the mode of activation  <cit> . target proteins have to expose the degron to the cytosol or nucleus to be available for regulation by the photo-sensitive degron module, a feature that is shared by all techniques that control protein stability by proteasomal degradation.

light-mediated regulation has the huge advantage over temperature or chemicals that it can be precisely regulated in quantity, space and time, at least at the level of micro-organisms or cell cultures. a vertebrate-adapted variant of the photo-sensitive degron has been established in zebrafish embryos and mammalian cells, which demonstrates the generality of the method  <cit> . the continuous illumination that is required to induce depletion of a target protein asks for photo-sensitive degron variants that highly destabilize the target at low illumination strength. the variants we describe here improve the original construct profoundly in these two critical features.
