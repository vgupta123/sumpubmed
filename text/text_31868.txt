BACKGROUND
broad-host-range conjugative plasmids are considered the main factors responsible for the horizontal spreading of genetic information between distantly related bacterial species. although the conjugation process has been fairly well described for some model systems like f, ti, r <dig> or rk <dig> , its regulation and the environmental stimuli responsible for the initiation of conjugation remain elusive. in gram-negative bacteria the conjugation functions comprise processing of dna for transfer  and mating pair formation . among dtr proteins the pivotal role is played by relaxase which recognizes a specific motif in orit , nicks a single dna strand, covalently binds to the 5′ end of the transferred strand  and re-joins the ends after ssdna translocation to the recipient. proteins involved in dtr and mpf functions form two large complexes: relaxosome   <cit>  and membrane located transferosome   <cit> . the third essential element of conjugative transfer system is a coupling protein  that links the relaxosome with the transferosome  <cit> . the auxiliary proteins help to determine the specificity of orit recognition by relaxase, enhance its nicking activity, stimulate atpase activity of the coupling protein and act as transcriptional regulators for conjugative transfer operons .

the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid ra <dig>  the archetype of the incu incompatibility group, has been isolated from the fish pathogen aeromonas hydrophila as the determinant of its antibiotic resistance  <cit> . ra <dig> nucleotide sequence has been determined ;  <cit>  and shown to be almost identical in its backbone part to another incu representative pfbaot <dig>  <cit> . the ra <dig> plasmid has been shown to be capable of replicating and self-transmitting between α-, β- and γ- proteobacteria with a very high efficiency  <cit> . the conjugative transfer functions of ra <dig> are clustered in a region of 23 kb organized in three transcriptional units . the first operon encodes two dna- transfer associated products : a predicted dna- binding protein mobc  and the relaxase nic . the sequence corresponding to the putative nick site of orit has been identified in silico upstream of the mobc-nic operon  <cit> . it was then confirmed that when an intergenic fragment of 417 bp containing putative oritra <dig>  was cloned into puc <dig>  <cit> , it facilitated plasmid mobilization by the ra <dig> with a high frequency  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
organization of the ra <dig> conjugative transfer module. a. transcriptional organization of the ra <dig> conjugative transfer module with orfs labeled according to the predicted function in the conjugation process: light grey arrows indicate homologs of mpf system, dark grey arrows indicate proteins presumably involved in dna replication and transfer , and the black one marks a homolog of coupling protein vird <dig>  b. dna sequence of mobcp/orit/pars region between  <dig> and 9869 nt of ra <dig> coordinates . thin arrows correspond to primers used in the construction of deletion derivatives by pcr. putative promoter motifs are boxed, and putative regulatory sequences are indicated by arrows. the inverted repeat ir-snabi is a part of the centromere-like sequence as the binding site for partitioning protein korb   <cit> . highly conserved nick site is circled and the ribosome binding site and initiation codon for mobc are in bold. the oligonucleotides tested as orits  are shown.



the second transfer operon located on the opposite dna strand encompasses  <dig> open reading frames encoding proteins mainly involved in the mating pair formation , four putatively in dtr functions , and a homolog of the coupling protein vird <dig>  <cit> . the third operon contains three orfs orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  encoding a predicted membrane associated proteins and a dna binding protein  <cit> , that fulfill the auxilliary transfer functions .

we initiated a functional analysis of the ra <dig> conjugative module to uncover the roles of individual elements in this extremely efficient transfer system  <cit>  starting from the operon mobc-nic. the closest homologs of mobc from incu plasmids  <cit>  have been found encoded in the similarly organized transfer regions of promiscuous plasmids from a putative new plasmid group, designated proma  <cit> . they all have been intuitively classified as the auxiliary transfer protein   <cit> .figure  <dig>

the high-copy number expression vector pgbt <dig>  <cit> , based on the pmb <dig> replicon with laciq and tacp was used for regulated expression of mobc derivatives. the tacp-mobc transcriptional fusion with laciq was re-cloned also into the medium copy number broad-host range vector pbbr1mcs- <dig>  <cit> .

the mutant mobc1- <dig> allele resulted from a spontaneous nucleotide substitution introducing a stop codon after a <dig> of mobc. the deletion mutant mobc1- <dig> was constructed by cleavage of pjsb <dig>  by clai, filling-in the 5′ overhangs and re-ligation. this led to the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids from mobc being extended by three residues. plasmids for over-expression and purification of the mobc derivatives were constructed by inserting the mobc variants as ecori-sali fragments into pet28a kmr .

site-directed mutagenesis in vitro
to introduce mutations in the orit-mobcp region an in vitro pcr- based site-directed mutagenesis method  was used with the high fidelity pfuturbo dna polymerase. pairs of complementary primers #9/# <dig>  #11/# <dig>  #13/# <dig> and #15/# <dig>  were designed to introduce nucleotide substitutions in a particular region of the amplified plasmid dna accompanied by either removal of an existing restriction site or introduction of a new one to facilitate screening. candidate mutant plasmids were tested for the presence/absence of the restriction site affected by the mutagenic primers and the correctness of mutagenesis was verified by sequencing.

bacterial transformation
competent cells of e. coli were prepared by standard cacl <dig> method  <cit> .

determination of catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase activity 
xyle activity  was assayed in extracts from logarithmically growing cultures . the overnight cultures were used to inoculate 25 ml of l-broth  supplemented with antibiotics and  <dig>  mm iptg when needed. cultures were grown for  <dig>  h to 3 hrs at 37°c, centrifuged and pellets were re-suspended in 500 μl of  <dig>  m kpi buffer  and 50 μl of acetone and left on ice. after sonication the extracts were cleared by centrufugationat 16000× g for 15 min at 4°c. xyle activity was assayed spectrophotometrically according to zukowski method  <cit> . the reaction was initiated by addition of  <dig>  mm catechol solution. one unit of catechol  <dig> - dioxygenase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to convert 1 μmol of catechol to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde in 1 minute per mg of protein. protein concentration was determined using the bradford method  <cit> .

purification of his6-tagged mobc derivatives
for protein over-production and purification, e. coli bl <dig> was transformed with pet <dig> derivatives encoding n-terminally his6-tagged mobcs. the overnight inoculum of the transformant was diluted 1: <dig> to 500 ml of l-broth with kanamycin and cultured with shaking at 37°c for  <dig>  hours. then the  <dig>  mm iptg was added and culture left to grow for two hours. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, suspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer , and disrupted by sonication. the extract was purified by affinity chromatography as described previously  <cit>  with the use of protino column . eluted protein fractions were analyzed by sds-page using a phast system  with 20% homogeneous gels.

analysis of protein-dna interactions by electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
pcr- amplified dna fragments  of modified variants of the orit-mobcp region were excised from agarose gels and purified using the gel-out kit . the protein-dna binding reactions were performed for 15 min at 37°c in binding buffer 25 mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> ; 10 mm mgcl2; 50 mm nacl;  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> bsa) in a final volume of 20 μl with increasing amounts of his6-mobc added. the mobc binding was analyzed on  <dig> % agarose gels run in 1xtbe buffer. the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and dna visualized under uv light.

cross-linking with glutaraldehyde
his6-tagged mobcs purified on ni2+-agarose column were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde  <cit>  and separated on 20%  sds-page gel. the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and western blotting with anti-his tag antibodies was performed as described previously  <cit> .

conjugation/ mobilization procedure
in the mobilization experiments the donor strain dh5α carried the ra <dig> or pjsb <dig>  , dh5α, dh5α, dh5α, dh5α were used as donors.

dh5α rifr strain was used as the recipient. aliquots of 100 μl of overnight cultures of the donor and recipient strains were mixed  and incubated on l-agar plates for 2 hours at 37°c. cells were scrapped, re-suspended in l-broth and 10 μl aliquots of serial 10-fold dilutions were spotted onto l-agar plates with 100 μg ml- <dig> rifampicin and 50 μg ml- <dig> kanamycin to estimate the number of transconjugants. in parallel, 100 μl of the donor strain overnight culture was incubated on l-agar plate for 2 hours at 37°c, cells were scrapped, diluted and plated on l-agar or l-agar with antibiotics selective for the donor strain. the transfer frequency was calculated as the number of transconjugants per donor cell.

bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid system 
the dimerization of mobc in vivo was analyzed using the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid  system in e. coli  <cit> . the mobc protein was fused translationally to cyat <dig> fragment and to cyat <dig> fragment at the n- or c-terminus using two pairs of compatible vectors . e. coli bth <dig>  an adenylate cyclase deficient strain , was co-transformed with the appropriate pairs of bacth plasmids and plated on macconkey medium suplemented with 1%  maltose,  <dig>  mm iptg and selective antibiotics. the plates were incubated for 48 h at 27°c. the ability to ferment maltose indicated the cyaa reconstitution through interactions between the fused polypeptides.

RESULTS
mobc is an autorepressor of the mobc-nic operon
the transfer module of ra <dig>  is located between the stability module and class i integron  <cit> . the first conjugative transfer operon, bi-cistronic mobc-nic, preceded directly by orit, encodes mobc and relaxase nic .

the homologs of mobc from incu plasmids  have been found encoded in the promiscuous plasmids from proma group  <cit> , by loci positioned in the junction region between maintenance and conjugative transfer operons that display similar genetic organization as incu plasmids  <cit> . the presence of the highly conserved structural motif lxxugxnlnqiaxxln in the c- terminal part classifies mobc and its proma homologs , as the putative conjugative transfer auxiliary proteins of mobp relaxases  <cit> .

mobcra <dig> is a putative dna binding protein of  <dig> amino acids with predicted ribbon-helix-helix  motif  according to the primary sequence analysis  <cit>  and secondary structure modelling . a characteristic pattern of alternating hydrophilic-hydrophobic side chains is present along n-terminal β-strand with hydrophobic side chains at conserved positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  while a positively charged residue usually occurs at position  <dig> or  <dig> . a second feature of the rhh motif is a conserved g-x-s/t/n sequence in the loop between helix α <dig> and helix α <dig> . at least four hydrophobic residues are usually present in helix α <dig> and helix α <dig> that together with hydrophobic side chains at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> comprise the hydrophobic core of rhh motif  <cit> . in the mobc there are six hydrophobic residues in the predicted helices.

the rhh superfamily of prokaryotic dna binding factors  <cit> , encompasses several transfer auxiliary proteins like trwa of plasmid r <dig> , tray of plasmid f , mbec of colei  and nika of r <dig>   <cit> .

to analyze the role of mobc in regulation of mobcp expression the 417-bp dna fragment upstream of the mobcra <dig> gene  was cloned into a promoter-probe vector ppt <dig>  <cit>  in front of the promoterless xyle cassette to construct pjsb <dig> . measurements of catechol  <dig> -dioxygenase activity  in the extracts of dh5α cells from the exponential phase of growth demonstrated a moderate level of mobcp transcriptional activity .

the mobc orf was cloned into the high-copy number expression vector pgbt <dig>  <cit>  under the control of tacp , to construct pjsb <dig> . introduction of pjsb <dig>  into the dh5α strain led to 20-fold repression of mobcp even without mobc over-production indicating that mobc is a very potent repressor. induction of mobc synthesis in dh5α by culturing in the presence of  <dig>  mm iptg for two hours switched off mobcp completely . no decrease in xyle activity was observed when strain dh5α was grown in the presence of iptg.

mapping of mobc operator
the mobcp sequences have been postulated previously as the ttgcta and taaaat hexamers separated by 20 nt  <cit> , motifs close to the consensus - <dig> and - <dig> sequences recognized by rnapσ <dig> . the sequence corresponding to the putative nick site of orit  <cit>  maps 50 nt upstream of the predicted transcription start point  for mobc. the analyzed region of 417 bp contains numerous structural motifs: two direct repeats dr <dig> and dr <dig> overlapped by inverted repeats and five additional inverted repeats designated ir-snabi and ir <dig> to ir <dig> . the ir-snabi motif was identified previously as the korb-binding site in the pars region  <cit> . two of the palindromic sequences, ir <dig> and ir <dig>  have their arms separated by 75 nt and 26 nt, respectively. to map om in the mobcp region a series of deletion derivatives was constructed by pcr amplification and the truncated fragments with intact putative promoter sequences were cloned into the promoter-probe vector ppt <dig> . all these derivatives were analyzed for promoter activity in the presence of empty expression vector  and mobc produced in trans .figure  <dig>

some variability in the level of mobcp expression was observed among the mutants analyzed . significantly, the deletion derivatives showed the same susceptibility to mobc repression as the original 417-bp fragment present in pjsb <dig>  . this indicated that dr <dig>  dr <dig>  ir <dig> and the left arm of ir <dig>  were not required for mobc to exert its regulatory effect. to exclude the possibility that one arm of ir <dig> could suffice for mobc binding, ir2b was mutated in a truncated promoter fragment of 100 bp  by site-directed pcr mutagenesis. the deletion of the ir2a arm and multiple substitutions in the remaining ir2b arm had no significant influence on mobc repression.

the above analysis of truncated mobcp fragments localized the mobc-binding site to a 100-bp region encompassing the promoter sequences and two palindromic motifs ir <dig> and ir <dig>  both ir <dig> and ir <dig> partly overlap the predicted promoter sequence  hence only limited modifications could be introduced into this region without affecting the promoter integrity . the pcr-based mutagenesis was performed on the puc <dig>  <cit>  derivative with the whole 417-bp insert , since the truncated mobcp regions exhibited variations in the transcriptional activity. the mutated inserts were re-cloned into the promoter-probe vector ppt <dig> and tested for mobcp activity and sensitivity to the mobc, produced from pjsb <dig>  in trans. nevertheless, even those few nucleotide substitutions led to a decrease of the mobcp activity  in some of the constructs. mobc repression was unaffected when ir3a was modified as in pjsb <dig>   whereas substitutions in ir <dig>  led to a decrease in repression by mobc .figure  <dig>

when one arm of the ir <dig> palindrome was modified  to give variant mutvi , the promoter became hardly sensitive to mobc repression , strongly suggesting that ir <dig> is the operator for mobc and that efficient mobc binding requires the intact palindrome .

ir <dig> is not a perfect palindrome, having two pairs of non-complementary nucleotides . to create a perfect palindromic sequence either left or right arm of the ir <dig> was modified by site-directed mutagenesis. version of ir <dig>  in mutvii  had a higher content of gc pairs whereas version of ir <dig>  in mutviii  had a higher content of at pairs than the wt sequence. none of these perfect palindromes was fully effective in mobc binding. in comparison to the 20-fold repression observed for the native non-perfect ir <dig>  the repression index was  <dig>  and  <dig> , when the mutated versions of ir <dig> mutviii or mutvii, respectively, were introduced into mobcp .

dna binding by mobc
the mobc orf was cloned under t7p into pet28a to give pjsb <dig> . his6-mobc over-produced in bl <dig> strain was purified by affinity chromatography and used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays  with wt mobcp fragment and its mutated versions.

mobc was able to bind and retard efficiently the 417-bp fragment comprising wt mobcp whereas no mobc binding was observed when an unspecific dna fragment was used . the affinity of mobc towards its operator om in the mobcp region estimated by kapp  varied in the range of 30- <dig> nm for different protein preparations.

dna binding studies performed with four mutated mobcp fragments showed that modification of ir <dig>  had no effect on the mobc binding . the binding affinity of mobc to fragments with the three versions of ir <dig> depended on the type of nucleotide substitution . the multiple nucleotide changes in one arm of ir <dig>  drastically decreased the mobc affinity . creating a perfect palindromic sequence by replacing two ts with two gs in the left arm of om  increased the kapp to  <dig> nm. the fragment with the perfect palindromic sequence mutviii with two cs substituted by as in the right arm  was bound by mobc with an approximately 10-fold lower affinity  than the wt sequence. the data of in vitro experiments correlated with the decreased index of repression in vivo and confirmed that ir <dig> plays a vital role in mobc binding and as such it was designated om - operator for mobc.

dimerization ability of mobc
to analyze the ability of mobc to self-interact in vivo and to define the role of the c-terminus in this process, two 3′-end deletion mutant derivatives mobc1- <dig> and mobc1- <dig> were constructed, encoding n-terminal  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively . the mobc orf and its mutant derivatives were cloned into the vectors of bacterial two-hybrid system bacth  <cit> . the wt mobc was inserted into two pairs of bacth vectors to fuse mobc translationally with cya fragments at the n- or the c-terminus. in two-hybrid tests mobc demonstrated a dimerization ability independently of which end of the protein was linked to the cya fragments. the two truncated forms of mobc differed in their ability to self-interact in the bacth system . mobc1- <dig> was not impaired in the dimerization in vivo whereas mobc1- <dig> lacked the self-interaction ability, suggesting that the c-terminal residues between  <dig> and  <dig> are important for this interaction .figure  <dig> 
mobc c-terminus is required for oligomerization but not dna binding. a. bacterial two-hybrid system in vivo. the mobc orf was cloned into two sets of bacth vectors to be linked with cyaa fragments by n-or c-terminus. photographs document the ability to ferment maltose by double transformants of bth101cyaa strain with plasmid encoding cyaa fragments linked to n-termini of mobc derivatives. the plkb <dig> and plkb <dig> represent modified empty bacth vectors pkt <dig> and put18c, respectively. similar results were obtained for plasmids encoding cyaa fragments linked to c- termini of mobc derivatives . b. glutaraldehyde cross-linking in vitro. his-tagged mobc derivatives  were incubated with increasing concentrations of glutaraldehyde . the complexes were separated on 20% polyacrylamide gels by sds-page, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and visualized bywestern blotting with anti-his tag antibodies. bands corresponding to monomeric , dimeric  and terameric  form of the mobc variants analyzed are marked. the protein migrating faster than mobc1- <dig> is probably a degradation product. c. regulation of mobcp by truncated mobc1- <dig>  allele mobc1- <dig> was cloned into pgbt <dig> under tacp  and introduced into dh5α strain. the double transformant strains were grown without iptg. the xyle activity is expressed relative to the activity detected in dh5α strain. dh5α strain was used as the control. mean values with standard deviation of at least three assays are shown. d. dna binding by mobc1- <dig> in vitro. two picomoles of 417-bp dna fragment containing mobcp were incubated with increasing quantities  of his-tagged mobc derivatives in 20 μl of binding buffer at 37°c for 15 minutes. the complexes were separated on  <dig> % agarose gels run in 1xtbe and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.



the mobc1- <dig> and mobc1- <dig> orfs were cloned under t7p into pet28a to give pjsb <dig>  and pjsb <dig> , respectively. the his6-mobc1- <dig> and his6-mobc1- <dig> were over-produced in bl <dig> transformants and purified by affinity chromatography according to the protocol used for wt mobc.

glutaraldehyde cross-linking confirmed the ability of wt mobc and mobc1- <dig> to form dimers, trimers and tetramers in solution  at low concentrations of the protein and the cross-linking agent. mobc1- <dig> only formed dimers under the highest glutaraldehyde concentration used. this suggests that the c-terminus of mobc ra <dig> is not absolutely required for dimerization, but its presence probably stabilizes the dimers  and probably facilitates the formation of higher oligomers. to verify these results the gel filtration chromatography was used to analyze the oligomeric state of purified proteins wt mobc and mobc1- <dig>  the molecular weights of both proteins in their monomeric state were estimated by mass spectrometry as 24 kda and 18 kda, respectively. the gel filtration profile of wt mobc indicated the major form of 49 kda  suggesting that mobc exists as a dimer in solution. no higher oligomers of mobc were detected under used conditions. the gel filtration profile of mobc1- <dig> confirmed its ability to form dimers since the major peak corresponded to protein of 42 kda.

purified his-tagged mobc1- <dig> was used in emsa with wt mobcp fragment and found to bind dna with a similar affinity as wt mobc .

to confirm the ability of mobc1- <dig> to bind dna in vivo the deletion variant mobc1- <dig> was cloned under tacp into the pgbt <dig> expression vector . using the mobcp-xyle transcriptional fusion in the two-plasmid regulatory system we found that mobc1- <dig> retained activity of a potent repressor. strong repression of mobcp-xyle was observed even at a low concentration of the truncated mobc1- <dig> in trans , similarly to the effect of wt mobc. this suggests that the observed defect in dimerization  does not affect the repressor function of mobc1- <dig> in vivo .

frequency of mobilization of modified mobcp fragments by ra <dig> conjugative system
in other studied conjugative systems auxiliary proteins are essential as being involved in relaxosome formation, specific recognition of nick site by relaxase and orit processing  <cit> . to check if binding of mobc to oritra <dig> affects basic relaxase function, conjugative transfer mobilization experiments with plasmids carrying mobcp derivatives were performed.

the ppt <dig> plasmid with a wt mobcp fragment inserted  was introduced into the dh5α strain to create a donor strain that could transfer ra <dig> by conjugation and/or mobilize pjsb <dig>  into the recipient strain dh5α rifr. the frequency of ra <dig> self-transfer was estimated to be close to 100% , the same as the mobilization frequency of pjsb <dig>  by ra <dig>  similar experiments performed with the truncated derivatives of mobcp demonstrated that deletions of the upstream sequences decreased the mobilization frequency  <dig> to 20-fold .

in the course of this analysis we also constructed mutant derivatives with two nucleotide substitutions at the putative nick site . ppt <dig> derivatives carrying these alleles  were not transferable by ra <dig> to the recipient strain under the conditions used . these results confirm the vital role of these two nucleotides in the recognition/nicking of orit .

a 100-fold decrease in the mobilization frequency was observed for a derivative of the 417-bp mobcp-orit fragment with several substitutions in the left arm of ir <dig>  . further studies will be necessary to define the role of these nucleotides in the binding of relaxase to orit.

most significantly, modifications of om in a full-length mobcp-orit fragment  did not drastically affect the mobilization frequency of tested ppt <dig> derivatives . this strongly implicates that the mobc binding to dna at om, although important for the transcriptional control of mobcp, is not strictly required for the conjugation process. it was further confirmed in the studies described in the next paragraph .

although the data clearly demonstrated that mobc-dna interactions are not important in the mobilization experiments  it did not exclude the possibility of mobc acting as the auxiliary protein through direct interactions with the relaxase or other components of the conjugative machinery.

influence of mobc on conjugation frequency of vectors with tra module of ra3
the conjugative transfer module of ra <dig>  was previously cloned into the high-copy-number plasmid pbgs <dig>  <cit>  together with korc gene  encoding ra <dig> global transcriptional regulator  <cit> . such construct pjsb <dig>  was capable of self-transmission  <cit>  at the frequency comparable with parental ra <dig> .

to analyze the significance of mobc for the efficiency of the conjugation process it was necessary to separate its autorepressor function from the potential conjugative transfer accessory role. the conjugative transfer region  was re-cloned into puc <dig> and the promoter region of mobc-nic operon was replaced by laciq-tacp regulatory region from pgbt <dig>  <cit> . the 45 nt fragment encompassing oritra <dig> but with om and part of the mobcp sequences deleted , designated orit <dig>  was inserted into puc <dig> derivative with the conjugative transfer module and mobc-nic under control of tacp to get the pjsb <dig>  . the frequency of self-transmission of pjsb <dig>  was very high, comparable to ra <dig>  confirming that a/ level of expression of mobc-nic operon from the uninduced tacp is adequate for efficient conjugation process, b/ the lack of mobc binding site om has no influence on the transfer efficiency.figure  <dig>

to verify inability of mobc to bind to orit <dig> two oligonucleotides  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt long were cloned into puc <dig> vector to obtain pjsb <dig>  and pjsb <dig> , respectively. the  <dig> nt fragment encompassed orit, ir3a and ir <dig>  sequences  whereas  <dig> nt fragment  was deprived of om. plasmid dnas were cut by pvuii in two fragments. the smaller fragments of both plasmid dna:  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt contained inserts of  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt, respectively. in the emsa experiment the  <dig> nt sequence, deprived of om, has not been recognized by mobc, the protein has bound specifically only to the fragment of  <dig> nt with  <dig> nt of orit inserted .

to check if mobc itself plays a role in the conjugative transfer the pjsb <dig>  was constructed, the variant of pjsb <dig>  in which the mobc gene was absent and only nic was expressed from the tacp . the 1000-fold decrease in the frequency of self-transmission of pjsb <dig>  indicated that mobc indeed acts as the conjugative transfer auxiliary protein. the strain dh5α was transformed with medium-copy number expression plasmid pjsb <dig>   and the double transformant was used as the donor strain in the conjugation. the high frequency of self-transmission of pjsb <dig>  was restored . similar effect of restoration was achieved when lack of mobc in pjsb <dig>  was complemented by tacp-mobc1- <dig> expressed in trans in the dh5α strain. it indicated that despite dimerization/ oligomerization deficiency mobc1- <dig> is not only a potent auto-repressor but also its function in enhancing the frequency of transfer is unaltered.

discussion
the ra <dig> plasmid, the archetype of incu group, has a mosaic-modular structure with the conjugative system similar to that found in many promiscuous environmental plasmids, some of them recently classified into the new group designated proma  <cit> .

we have initiated an experimental dissection of the incu conjugative transfer system to understand the reasons of the wide spreading of such modules among conjugative plasmids of different incompatibility groups and their high efficiency of transfer between a broad range of hosts. in this study we concentrated our efforts on a functional analysis of the mobc protein  and its interactions with dna.

the data demonstrates that mobc is a potent repressor of mobcp and as such controls the level of relaxase production. using different experimental approaches we identified the mobc-binding site om at a region overlapping the mobc promoter. this non-perfect palindromic sequence agcgtctg↑ccgccgct is recognized by mobc in vitro with a high affinity. attempts to improve the om by creating a perfect palindrome failed, showing clearly that the existing slightly imperfect configuration is optimal for mobc binding.

purified his6-mobc forms mainly dimers as it was shown by gel filtration chromatography in these solution conditions. some auxiliary proteins e.g. trwa of r <dig> exist as tetramers in solution  <cit>  others like mbec of cole <dig> plasmid are mainly dimeric  <cit> . to localize dimerization domain we analyzed c-terminally truncated mobc derivatives. deletion of c-terminal  <dig> amino acids  but not  <dig> amino acids  impaired self-interactions in vivo when tested in bacth system. the purified mobc1- <dig> formed dimers in solution as shown by use of the molecular sieve. the intact mobc had an ability to form trimers and tetramers in the presence of the cross-linking agent whereas mobc1- <dig> formed only dimers under these conditions. so far the function of the higher order forms of mobc is not clear.

mobc1- <dig> binds efficiently to the operator sequence and represses mobcp in vivo to the same extent as does the wt mobc. it means that the n-terminal part is sufficient for specific dna binding and a weak dimerization whereas the c-terminus is required to stabilize the dimers.

deletion of c-terminal  <dig> amino acids removes part of the conserved “bacterial mobilization motif” . the role of this motif in interactions of the auxiliary proteins with the conjugation machinery has been implicated  <cit> . truncated mobc1- <dig> fully complemented the role of wt mobc in enhancing the conjugative transfer. hence whether mobc assists the relaxase nic in its functions or stimulates the coupling protein vird <dig>  it does not require the intact motif. direct interactions have been detected using the bacth system neither between mobc and nic nor mobc and vird <dig> so far .

mobc differs from known conjugative transfer auxilliary proteins since its binding to dna close to orit seems not to be strictly required for the relaxase action at orit. all mobilizable plasmids with the om modified in such a way as to abolish or severely impair mobc binding  demonstrated highly similar mobilization frequency when compared to plasmid pjsb <dig>  with a wt fragment inserted. moreover, the frequency of self-transmission of plasmid pjsb <dig> , carrying ra <dig> conjugative module but with orit deprived of om  has not been even slightly affected.

the absence of mobc did not stop the self-transmission of pjsb <dig> , although it led to 1000-fold decrease in the transfer efficiency in comparison to pjsb <dig> . whereas significant, it is a much less pronounced effect than observed in other studied plasmids when deprived of the auxiliary proteins  <cit> .

the functionality of orit in the centromere-like region of the partition operon has been shown experimentally for ra <dig> of incu  <cit> . there, the nick site precedes the transcription start point for mobc by 50 nt, and substitutions of two nucleotides in this sequence  abolish the mobilization capacity of a test plasmid  by the ra <dig> conjugation system. our analysis of mutants with nucleotide substitutions adjacent to the nick site has revealed the importance of one arm of a short palindromic sequence designated ir <dig> for the processing of orit . further studies are required to understand the role of this motif in the transfer efficiency.

plasmids of the incu and proma incompatibility groups share the transcriptional organization of at least two putative conjugative transfer operons. the location of the orit sequence in the promoter regions of mobc-nic and their counterparts in other plasmids is at the border of conjugative transfer modules and the partition operons , however the nick sites identified in silico in proma representatives do not precede but rather overlap the predicted - <dig> sequences of promoters for the mobc homologs: orf <dig> of psb <dig>  orf <dig> of pipo <dig>  orf <dig> of pmol <dig>  mobc of pter <dig> and mobc of pmrad <dig> .figure  <dig>

interestingly, the conservation of the promoter regions of the mobc counterparts in the incu and proma plasmids has been lost around the sequence of the identified om in ra <dig> . in the proma plasmids there are palindromic sequences overlapping or located downstream of a predicted - <dig> motif, presumably forming the binding site for the mobc homologs.

the role of the other structural motifs in the mobcp-orit region of ra <dig>  remains unknown but a possibility of tertiary cruciform structure formation  seems very attractive especially for the two inverted repeats ir <dig> and ir <dig> with arms separated by 75 nt and 26 nt, respectively .

one of these palindromes, the gc-rich ir <dig>  is highly conserved between ra <dig> and three out of five proma representatives not only in the primary sequence but also in the position of the arms encompassing promoter sequences, putative om and nick sites . our future studies will be aimed at understanding the functions of these motifs and the interplay between nic and mobc , incc and korb  and transcriptional machinery at a potentially highly-structured pars-orit-mobcp region that must accommodate all these complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have demonstrated that mobc of ra <dig> plasmid acts as an auxiliary transfer protein of dual function. it autoregulates the expression of mobcp controlling the level of relaxase production. it binds to dna recognizing an imperfect palindromic sequence  overlapping the promoter motifs. dna binding domain is localized in the n-terminal part of the protein. the c-terminus participates in the stabilization of oligomeric forms. besides its role as the transcriptional repressor mobc stimulates the frequency of conjugation process. for this activity mobc binding in the orit region is not required. future studies should establish whether mobc stimulates relaxosome formation, activity of relaxase or affects other stages of the conjugation process . the role of the structural motifs identified in the orit of incu, and conserved in putative orit regions of proma plasmids, awaits elucidation.
