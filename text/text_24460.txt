BACKGROUND
the mycoplasmas are wall-less prokaryotes characterized by small genomes  and a low g+c content, generally below 30%. they are the smallest self-replicating organisms known with cell diameters normally in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  μm  <cit> , and are observed as parasites of insects, plants, animals and humans with strict host specificities. as a consequence of the direct exposure of proteins located on the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane to the surrounding environment, antigenic variation of surface proteins is observed among mycoplasmas. the often chronic nature of mycoplasmal infections is thought to be a consequence of evasion of the humoral immune response by the variation displayed by these coat proteins  <cit> .

mycoplasma hominis is an opportunistic human pathogen observed as a commensal of the urogenital tract. primarily, urogenital infections giving rise to spontaneous abortions, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acute pyelonephritis have been associated with m. hominis, but extragenital infections resulting in infant meningitis, arthritis, and septicemia have been reported  <cit> .

m. hominis is a very heterogeneous species as measured by a pronounced antigenic variation  <cit> . the molecular basis for antigen variation of m. hominis surface proteins has been elucidated in some cases. the large membrane protein  gene family displays size variation by insertion/deletion of intragenic repeats of approximately  <dig> bp. the lmp genes are arranged in two clusters, lmp1- <dig> and lmp3- <dig> in the m. hominis genome of most analysed isolates with a distance between the clusters of more than  <dig> kb  <cit> . at least one member of the lmp family is expressed in each of the m. hominis isolates tested and decrease in the number of repeats were found to correlate to the amount of spontaneous agglutination of m. hominis cells  <cit> .

the vaa  gene encodes a size and phase variable m. hominis adhesin  <cit> . phase variation is accomplished by variation in the number of bases in a poly-a tract situated in the 5'-end of the gene  <cit> . this is presumably achieved by slipped strand mispairing with a frequency of 10-3–10- <dig>  in the on-state  <dig> adenines are observed in the poly-a tract, whereas  <dig> or  <dig> results in the out-of-frame off-state  <cit> . a single vaa gene is present in each m. hominis isolate  <cit> . the size of vaa observed in different isolates ranges from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda. this size variation is the consequence of a variable number of homologous, exchangeable cassette sequences located in the 3' end of vaa  <cit> . each cassette encodes approximately  <dig> aa containing a coiled-coil motif and  <dig> to  <dig> cassettes have been observed in different vaa proteins. the vaa protein is a rod-shaped, monomeric protein and the cassettes are presumed to form homologous, 'spike'-formed binding domains arranged in parallel in the three-dimensional structure  <cit> . based on the cassette composition,  <dig> distinct vaa gene types have been observed in more than  <dig> analysed clinical isolates  <cit> . the mechanism behind this variation is unknown, but duplication/deletion of cassettes followed by divergence of cassette sequences has been suggested  <cit> . comparison of the homology between cassettes showed that the cassette sequences could be divided arbitrarily into  <dig> cassette types based on sequence identity. analysis of the cassette organization in different isolates revealed that intraspecies recombination resulting in the exchange of cassette sequences could be an alternative mechanism for variation of vaa  <cit> .

to obtain a better understanding of the genomic basis for variation of vaa and variation mechanisms in m. hominis in general, the vaa locus was characterized by mapping of the genomic position in five isolates and sequencing of a  <dig> kb region containing the vaa gene from isolate  <dig>  furthermore, the vaa locus of  <dig> m. hominis isolates was investigated by pcr and sequencing. in contrast to the more conserved vaa upstream region this analysis revealed that the downstream region also exhibits major variation caused by insertion/deletion and sequence variation of a large orf encoding a putative membrane protein. thus the vaa locus seems to constitute a 'hot spot' for variation in the m. hominis genome.

RESULTS
genomic localization of the vaa gene
the vaa gene was mapped on exsisting physical and genetic maps of  <dig> m. hominis isolates:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  pg <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . chromosomal dna from the isolates was digested by the restriction endonucleases smai, bamhi, xhoi, sali, and apai and the fragments were separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis . the fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with three datp-labelled dna fragments representing different parts of selected vaa genes . all probes hybridized to a single fragment in all digests, corresponding to the same region of the genome for all  <dig> isolates . the fragments were located in a genomic region near the gyrb gene . a number of other m. hominis genes encoding membrane proteins  were also positioned in this region of the genome  <cit> .

to further analyse the variability of the vaa locus, restriction endonuclease analysis was performed. southern blotting of hindiii and ecori cleaved genomic dna separated with ordinary agarose gel electrophoresis from the  <dig> isolates using probe  <dig> was made . the probe recognized a band of  <dig>  kb in the isolates  <dig> and  <dig> and a band of  <dig>  kb in isolates  <dig>  pg <dig>  and  <dig> in the hindiii digest . the band size difference between the isolates could be attributed to the fact that the hindiii site relative to the atg start codon in the vaa genes of isolates  <dig>  pg <dig>  and  <dig> was located  <dig> bp further upstream compared to the hindiii site in isolates  <dig> and  <dig>  this indicates that the hindiii site upstream vaa is conserved. bands of diverging size were observed in the isolates for the ecori digest using this probe . the band differences observed could be explained by the presence or absence of an ecori site in the variable vaa gene. using a probe comprising the cassette region of the vaa category  <dig>  gene  band size variation was observed in the  <dig> isolates for both enzymes . the results of the southern blotting experiments confirmed that vaa is present as a single copy in the genome and indicated sequence variation in the vaa locus.

amplification and sequencing of the vaa locus of m. hominis 132
as the mapping and restriction endonuclease analysis of vaa indicated a variable locus, we decided to sequence this genomic region of the m. hominis genome to determine the cause of the variability. a hindiii/ecori restriction map of the vaa locus of isolate  <dig> was made using the southern blotting results . the sizes of most of the hindiii and ecori fragments including the up- and downstream regions of vaa were  <dig>  kb or below. these fragments were thus suitable for amplification by inverse pcr. the genomic dna was cleaved by hindiii or ecori and religated. outward pointing oligonucleotide primers located in the vaa gene were used in pcr on the religated template in order to amplify regions outside the gene . pcr products of the expected sizes were observed and sequenced bidirectionally. a contig of approximately  <dig> kb was assembled. in order to expand the contig, a new round of inverse pcr was performed using new primer sets located in each end of the contig. the upstream region was expanded using the hindiii cleaved and religated template. to expand the downstream region, chromosomal dna cleaved with bglii and religated was used as template. sequencing of the expanded regions revealed that an orf showing high similarity to the uvra gene by database search was located approximately  <dig> kb upstream to vaa. the annotation of this orf as uvra, the gene encoding excinuclease abc subunit a, was based on homology alone as this gene has not yet been characterized in mycoplasmas. furthermore, the conserved hitb gene, part of the hitabl operon, was identified in the opposite end of the vaa locus . the hitabl operon comprises three highly conserved genes. the hitab genes encode the p <dig> and p <dig> proteins, respectively. p <dig> and p <dig> form a membrane associated complex that interacts by an unknown mechanism with the evolutionary conserved, cytoplasmic hint  protein encoded by hitl. this system was previously characterized in m. hominis by henrich and coworkers  <cit> . the hitabl operon was located almost  <dig> kb downstream to the vaa gene of m. hominis  <dig> . thus, the vaa locus is bordered by highly conserved housekeeping genes. a bidirectionally sequenced contig of  <dig>  kb comprising the vaa locus was assembled .

gene organization of the vaa locus of m. hominins 132
analysis of the contig harboring the vaa locus revealed a number of open reading frames . at the border of the sequenced upstream region the uvra gene, represented by  <dig> bp of the 5' end of the gene, is located. between uvra and vaa five orfs, numbered  <dig> to  <dig>  were detected, orf <dig> encoding a putative protein of only  <dig> kda . this orf was included as proteins of similar size has been detected in other bacteria  <cit> . the transcriptional direction of these orfs and uvra was opposite that of vaa. the orfs were positioned closely, orfs  <dig> and  <dig> had a  <dig> bp intergenic region, and orfs  <dig> and  <dig> had an intergenic region of  <dig> bp. orfs  <dig> and  <dig> showed an overlap of  <dig> bp. thus, orfs  <dig> to  <dig> might constitute an operon. no obvious stem-loop structures with a putative rho-independent transcriptional termination function were observed immediately downstream to any of the orfs. the hypothetical genes were employed in database searches. the orf adjacent to uvra, , encoding a hypothetical  <dig> kda protein, showed high similarity to a range of hypothetical proteins of similar size in the database. all of these proteins contained a had hydrolase superfamily motif. the highest similarity was to a hypothetical protein of mycoplasma pulmonis . no significant homologues were found for orfs  <dig> to  <dig>  orf <dig> was shown to encode a hypothetical protein containing an n-terminal signal peptide with a signal peptidase ii cleavage site typical of prokaryotic prolipoproteins and may thus encode a lipoprotein having a size of  <dig> kda and a pi of  <dig> . interestingly, a transmembrane helix was predicted in the c-terminal part of this putative lipoprotein using the program tmhmm   <cit> .

the downstream region of vaa revealed the presence of a large open reading frame of  <dig> kb, orf <dig>  encoding a hypothetical protein with a molecular weight of  <dig> kda . a secretory signal peptide was identified in the n-terminal part of the putative protein using the program signalp  <cit> . a signal peptidase i cleavage site was identified between a <dig> and s <dig> , but as no gene encoding signal peptidase i has been observed in most of the sequenced mycoplasma genomes, the protein is most likely not processed  <cit> . a homopolymeric tract of  <dig> thymidine residues  was located  <dig> bp upstream to the atg start codon of orf <dig>  and a putative rho-independent stem-loop terminator structure  was observed  <dig> bp downstream of orf <dig>  the deduced aa sequence of orf <dig> was used in a database search and intriguingly, high similarity to the lmp- <dig> and lmp- <dig> proteins of m. hominis was found, the highest similarity was to lmp- <dig> . surprisingly, homology was also found to the myosin heavy chain protein of the slime mold dictyostelium discoideum , and other myosin proteins in the database. in the region between orf <dig> and the hitabl operon, a trna gene was identified by database search . the highest similarity observed was to the trna of bacillus subtilis. intriguingly, the 5' end of the gene displayed a high similarity to the orthologue from streptococcus pneumoniae , even higher than to the corresponding region in bacillus subtilis  and mycoplasma pneumoniae . the transcriptional direction of orf <dig>  trna and the hitabl operon was opposite that of vaa in analogy to the orfs of the vaa upstream region .

variability of the vaa locus in  <dig> m. hominis isolates
to examine the variability of the vaa locus, pcr was performed on  <dig> m. hominis isolates representing different vaa types. using a primer located in the conserved region of vaa and a primer located in the uvra gene, a pcr product of  <dig>  kb was amplified . all isolates gave rise to a band of identical size for the primer set . furthermore, pcr was performed using the primer located in the conserved region of vaa and a primer located in orf <dig> or orf <dig>  this amplified fragments of  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively, in all analysed isolates . the pcr results thus suggested that the upstream region is very conserved. additionally, restriction endonuclease analysis of the  <dig>  kb pcr fragment was made using the enzymes alui and asei, which cleaves at  <dig> and  <dig> sites, respectively, scattered over the entire fragment of isolate  <dig>  this analysis revealed  <dig> and  <dig> digestion profiles, respectively, of the  <dig> isolates . it was not possible to classify the profiles according to the vaa type or other known m. hominis groupings. thus, despite a higly conserved organization and length of the orfs in the vaa upstream region, there is an underlying sequence variation, presumably corresponding to the background variation level present in the m. hominis genome.

in contrast, when primers located in the conserved region of vaa and hitb, respectively, were used in pcr, a pattern revealing different product sizes was observed . the expected  <dig>  kb pcr product was amplified in  <dig> isolates,  <dig> gave rise to bands of approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> gave rise to larger bands of  <dig>  and  <dig> kb . the size of the  <dig> kb products corresponded to the deletion of orf <dig>  this was verified by sequencing of the products from m. hominis pg <dig> and  <dig> . sequencing of the  <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb pcr products from m. hominis  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, revealed orfs of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb showing homology to orf <dig> . because of the apparent variability of this protein, orf <dig> and the corresponding orfs of m. hominis  <dig> and  <dig> were named vmp . the isolates were divided into vmp groups based on the above pcr results according to the size of the vmp gene observed in the different sized downstream pcr products. the vmp gene having a size of  <dig> kb was named vmp category  <dig> or simply vmp- <dig>  and the isolates  giving rise to a  <dig>  kb downstream pcr product, containing the vmp- <dig> gene, were categorized as having a vmp- <dig> gene type . likewise, the vmp genes having a size of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were named vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig>  respectively, and the isolates giving rise to downstream pcr products of  <dig>  and  <dig> kb  were categorized as having a vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> gene type, respectively . it was not possible to design a universal vmp primer set that would amplify a fragment from all the sequenced vmp genes due to the high sequence variation observed between the genes. instead, a primer set amplifying a  <dig>  kb fragment of vmp- <dig> was used for pcr of the  <dig> isolates. four of the five genes categorized as vmp- <dig> gave rise to a strong band of  <dig>  kb . the isolate  <dig> also categorized as having a vmp- <dig> gene type gave rise to a very faint band of  <dig>  kb. a second primer set was designed that would amplify a  <dig>  kb fragment from both vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> . again, only four of the five isolates expected gave a product. the isolate sc <dig> categorized as having a vmp- <dig> gene type also gave a faint band with the vmp-2/ <dig> primer set. the isolate 1572b did not give a product with the primer set, but was categorized as having a vmp- <dig> gene type because it gave rise to a downstream pcr product of approximately  <dig>  kb. thorough examination revealed that the size of the 1572b downstream pcr product was slightly smaller than that of isolate  <dig>  thus, isolate 1572b may harbor a fourth vmp type. the vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> genes were flanked by a poly-t tract and a stem-loop terminator structure  showing high homology of the stem regions to that observed for vmp- <dig>  the stem-loop structure was located approximately  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon of vmp- <dig> but interestingly, the homology between vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> extends beyond the stop codon in vmp- <dig>  careful analysis reveals that a poly-a tract in the 3'-end of the vmp genes has an extra  adenine in vmp- <dig> compared to vmp- <dig>  which causes a premature termination of translation of the vmp- <dig> gene. if the extra adenine of the poly-a tract was deleted the orf would continue for approximately  <dig> bp, corresponding to vmp- <dig>  and the termination codon would be situated close the putative rho-independent transcriptional termination stem-loop structure. the remaining  <dig> isolates were divided into two groups based on a genetic fingerprint in the vaa-hitabl intergenic region of isolates lacking vmp . the genetic fingerprint was an insertion/deletion in the intergenic regions downstream to vaa. the vaa-hitabl intergenic region of isolate  <dig> was nearly identical to the corresponding region of isolate pg <dig>  except for a deletion of approximately  <dig> bp shortly after the vaa terminator stem-loop structure . two isolates  gave the  <dig>  kb downstream pcr product, whereas the remaining  <dig> isolates gave the  <dig> kb downstream pcr product of isolate  <dig> . the vmp type or absence of the vmp gene showed no correlation to the vaa type of the isolates. surprisingly, the position of the vmp gene relative to the trna gene was different for vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig>  the latter positioned between trna and hitabl, whereas the more similar vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> genes were positioned identically . a careful sequence analysis was performed on the insertion/deletion sites of the vmp genes to try to deduce a mechanism of insertion/deletion. the vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> genes seemed to be inserted at the poly-t tract in the 5' end and stem-loop terminator structure at the 3' end. when compared to the vaa-hitabl intergenic region of isolate pg <dig>  the sequences flanking the insertion sites were identical in isolates 7488/ <dig> and pg <dig> and insertion did not result in deletion of part of the intergenic sequence. the insertion site was a/t rich, and sequence identity was observed in a small  <dig> bp thymidine-rich  sequence box between the insertion site in isolate pg <dig> and the stem region of the stem-loops of vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig>  furthermore, a  <dig> bp deletion  was observed in the vaa-trna intergenic region of isolate  <dig> compared to isolate pg <dig>  this deletion was located immediately downstream to the region deleted in isolate  <dig>  in contrast, analysis of the vmp- <dig> insertion site did not show insertion at the stem-loop and poly-t structures when compared to the vaa-hitabl intergenic regions of isolates pg <dig> and  <dig>  sequence regions of  <dig> bp downstream to the stem-loop structure and  <dig> bp upstream to the poly-t tract which did not show any homology to the vaa-hitabl intergenic region of isolate pg <dig> were observed at the borders of the vmp- <dig> gene. interestingly, comparison of the insertion site of the vmp- <dig> region including the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp bordering sequences with the vaa-hitabl intergenic region of isolate pg <dig> revealed that insertion resulted in a deletion in the intergenic sequence corresponding to the  <dig> bp deletion  observed for isolate  <dig>  the sequences flanking this region in isolate pg <dig> was a/t rich but did not show high homology to each other or to the insertion site of the vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> genes. in conclusion, no obvious direct or inverted repeat structures were observed indicating a mechanism of insertion other than homologous recombination. isolates pg <dig> and  <dig> shared identical vaa-hitabl intergenic regions outside the vmp- <dig> insertion . these isolates carry distinct vaa gene types, pg <dig> having a three cassette vaa- <dig> type and  <dig> having a two cassette vaa- <dig> type  <cit> . the distal 3' end cassette of these vaa genes shows high mutual similarity, whereas the remaining exchangeable cassettes of both genes are distinct . the 5' end including the first cassette of the vaa gene of isolate  <dig> shows high similarity to the corresponding part of the vaa gene of isolate  <dig>  harboring a different two cassette vaa gene type. the 3' end distal cassette of vaa from isolate  <dig> differs from that of isolates pg <dig> and  <dig>  thus, the vaa type of isolate  <dig> seems to be a chimera of the vaa types of isolates  <dig> and pg <dig> .

the gc content of the vaa and vmp genes of isolate  <dig> were 27% and 25% compared to a total of 25% for the  <dig>  kb contig.

characterization and detection of the vmp protein
alignments of the deduced vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> protein sequences revealed highest similarity in the c-terminal part . half of this region was repeated once in vmp- <dig> . the n-terminal part showed a lower, but significant overall similarity . in contrast, vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> showed almost complete conservation of the n-terminal part , whereas the c-terminal part showed a similarity corresponding to that between the vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> . the repeated region of vmp- <dig> was only present in one copy in vmp- <dig> 

sequence analysis revealed that the deduced vmp proteins have a predominantly alpha-helical structure, and a coiled-coil region extending throughout almost the entire length of the proteins was identified . in vmp- <dig> the coiled-coil motif extended from residues  <dig> to  <dig> out of a total of  <dig> residues. likewise, the coiled-coil region of vmp- <dig> spanned residues  <dig> to  <dig> out of  <dig> and residues  <dig> to  <dig> out of  <dig> residues of vmp- <dig>  the coiled-coil region contained numerous short disruptions of the predicted coiled-coil and alpha-helical structure . as this region showed high similarity to the lmp proteins, the lmp sequences were analysed for the presence of a coiled-coil region. intriguingly, the lmp proteins were shown to contain a coiled-coil region extending throughout most of the protein in analogy to the vmps .

a polyclonal antibody was raised against the distal c-terminal part of vmp- <dig> from isolate  <dig> . this region shows low homology to the vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig>  and the antibody was applied in immunoblotting using antigen from  <dig> selected isolates . the antibody reacted with a protein of  <dig> kda from isolates  <dig>   <dig>  dc <dig> and sc <dig>  in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of the protein encoded by the vmp- <dig> gene of these isolates. these data thus demonstrate that vmp is expressed in m. hominis. furthermore, the antibody reacted with a  <dig> kda protein in all isolates except pg <dig>  this is presumably a protein that has been shown previously to bind ig-molecules unspecifically, and is not present in pg <dig>  <cit> . apart from the  <dig> kda protein the isolates pg <dig> and  <dig>  having no vmp gene, and isolates  <dig> and  <dig> having a vmp- <dig> and vmp- <dig> type, respectively, did not react with the antibody, as expected from the low homology of the c-terminal region .

discussion
the presented analysis of the vaa locus reveals that it is a highly dynamic region of the m. hominis genome. the data indicate that variation in the 3' end of the vaa gene may be attributed recombinational events involving regions outside the gene. the insertion/deletion of the vmp gene downstream to vaa in different positions relative to the trna gene, and the lack of correlation of vmp type and absence of vmp to vaa type suggests frequent recombination in this locus . the finding that the two distinct vaa types of isolates pg <dig> and  <dig> share 3' end cassettes and homologous downstream intergenic sequences, suggests that the vaa type of  <dig> arose from intraspecies recombination . this event might have taken place between a m. hominis cell carrying a vaa type with a 5'end analogous to the vaa type of isolate  <dig> and a cell harboring a vaa type with a 3' end similar to that of pg <dig>  another m. hominis gene encoding a surface exposed lipoprotein, p <dig>  was shown to contain a hypervariable and two semivariable domains  <cit> . this gene maps in close proximity to the vaa locus in the m. hominis genome . the groups of isolates carrying a specific hypervariable domain did not correlate with the vaa type  <cit> . thus it is plausible that this region of the m. hominis genome harboring most of the characterized genes for membrane proteins is a genomic plasticity zone as previously suggested  <cit> .

based on these findings, recombination between different m. hominis subpopulations may be a general mechanism for the generation of antigen variation in this mycoplasma species. a necessity for intraspecies recombination is the transfer of dna. no plasmids or phages have been observed for m. hominis, but the transfer of tn <dig>  presumably by conjugation, from a streptococcus faecalis donor has been shown with low efficiency  <cit> . conjugation between m. hominis cells has not been demonstrated. chemically competent m. hominis were shown to be capable of uptake of homologous naked dna. this was demonstrated by the transfer of tetracycline resistance from the dna of a tetracycline resistant m. hominis isolate to a competent, sensitive isolate  <cit> . thus, the knowledge regarding mechanisms of dna uptake in m. hominis is sparse, and this subject needs to be addressed.

the location of vmp in close proximity to a trna gene is analogous to genetic elements of other bacteria. these elements, often referred to as genetic islets  or genetic islands , are variable sites when comparing genomes of different isolates of a given species. often, genetic islets/islands carry pathogenesis factors and are specific for virulent clones of the species. such factors include adhesins, toxins and restriction/modification systems. frequently, the genetic elements are inserted into trna genes, show a gc content diverging from the surrounding regions and are flanked by repeated elements  <cit> . although the vmp gene was located on either side of the trna gene in isolates  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, the gc content of vmp was similar to the remaining part of the vaa locus analyzed and the m. hominis genome in general  and despite a thorough analysis, no obvious flanking structures such as direct or inverted repeats were observed which could indicate a site specific mechanism of insertion. thus, the vmp gene may be mycoplasma specific and insertion/deletion of vmp at the vaa locus seems mediated by homologous recombination.

it was possible to amplify vmp fragments by pcr from four out of five isolates categorized as having a vmp- <dig> gene type and likewise for four out of five isolates having a vmp- <dig> or vmp- <dig> gene type. the pronounced heterogeneity observed between the vmp genes could explain the missing reaction of the remaining two isolates as being caused by sequence variation of the individual gene types as observed for a number of other m. hominis membrane protein genes, but it is also possible that additional vmp gene types exists.

the size and predicted structure of vmp is interesting. the coiled-coil motif extending through most of the protein, is a highly versatile motif involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . this motif is found in proteins carrying out diverse functions such as structural proteins, transcription factors, translation factors and extracellular proteins  <cit> . the coiled-coil domains often mediate the oligomerization of proteins forming di-, tri-, tetra- or even pentamers  <cit> . additionally, coiled-coil motifs in some cases are involved in intramolecular interactions forming highly stable, ridgid and compact structures. the length of the coiled-coil region in the primary structure of vmp is comparable to that of eukaryotic class ii myosins, proteins involved in movement along actin filaments  <cit> . furthermore, a coiled-coil region of similar length was observed for the cytadherence related hmw <dig> protein of mycoplasma pneumoniae. this protein is cytoplasmic, part of the primitive cytoskeleton of this mycoplasma and truncation of the gene resulted in loss of cytadherence  <cit> . hmw <dig> is believed to form dimers due to the coiled-coil region  <cit> . in contrast to hmw <dig>  vmp contains a c-terminal region having no coiled-coil motifs. furthermore, a signal sequence involved in transmembrane translocation of proteins was identified in the vmps, but not in hmw <dig>  thus, it is highly likely that the vmp protein is located on the cell surface of m. hominis in contrast to the cytoplasmic hmw <dig> 

the identification of a novel putative membrane protein displaying sequence variation is intriguing, and furthermore the remarkable size and structure displayed by the vmp protein is interesting and should prompt investigations on the biological function of this protein in m. hominis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that in some isolates, the vaa locus of m. hominis contains a divergent genetic islet encoding a large, putative membrane protein called variable membrane protein . this genetic islet is only present in the locus of half of the  <dig> islolates tested, and three distinct, homologous vmp types were observed. the composition of the locus was analysed and it was found that the vaa gene has a conserved upstream region and a highly variable downstream region, which contains the genetic islet. this locus organization corresponds to the organization of the vaa gene itself having a conserved 5' end and a variable 3' end. thus, the mechanism underlying variation of the vaa gene seems to be intraspecies recombination exchanging variable regions of vaa and downstream regions of vaa, giving rise to a variable and dynamic 'hot spot' in the m. hominis genome.
