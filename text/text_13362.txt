BACKGROUND
amniotic fluid cells  can be classified in epitheloid e-type cells, amniotic fluid specific af-type cells and fibroblastic f-type cells . in recent years, different reports have demonstrated that presence in human amniotic fluid of stem cells  able to differentiate into multiple lineages  <cit> . very recently, the ability of clonal afs to produce cell types inclusive of all embryonic germ layers was demonstrated  <cit> . unlike embryonic stem cells, afs have been showed to be not tumorigenic after transplantation in mice  <cit> . as a consequence, several studies have suggested the usefulness of these cells for therapeutic purposes  <cit> . osteoblastic cells derived from afs could be useful for bone regeneration after traumatic or degenerative damage  <cit> . in fact, osteoblastic progenitors obtained from amniotic fluid could be used to engineer the craniofacial structures whose natural development is regulated by mesenchymal cells originating from the neural crest, avoiding long and difficult therapies of bone augmentation with intra-oral or extra oral donor site  <cit> . in order to obtain the best results in craniofacial tissue engineering, great relevance is assumed by the use of scaffolds able to accommodate cell growth and tissue genesis. to date, implants with different surface treatments are investigated to define the best surface morphology for a good osteoblastic cell proliferation and osseointegration around implant  <cit> .

the aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability of human afs to differentiate into osteogenic cells using a novel single step culture protocol, and to test their growth ability on different implant surfaces.

RESULTS
osteoblastic differentiation was obtained in the present study using two different culture protocols of amniotic fluid cells. in the first protocol , amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells  were transferred in osteogenic medium at passage  <dig>  while in the second protocol , pellets of amniotic fluid samples were directly resuspended in osteogenic medium without the selection of afmscs.

a flow chart describing the different timing of the two protocols used in this study is reported in figure  <dig> 

in protocol  <dig>  seven days after the initiation of the primary culture, fibroblast-like cells appeared both isolated and as colonies in the culture flask . after 20– <dig> days of culture, at 70–80% confluence , cells were treated with trypsin and edta and collected. rt-pcr analysis, carried out on rna extracted from the cells at this stage, evidenced the presence of genes previously reported as expressed in afmscs  <cit> , namely sdf <dig>  cxcr <dig>  oct- <dig>  scf, gata- <dig>  vim, fgf- <dig>  pax- <dig>  ncam, afp, bmp- <dig> . cells collected at day 20– <dig> were transferred and cultured in the osteogenic medium. after  <dig> days of culture in osteogenic medium , the cells showed 70–75% confluence, and the presence of aggregates or nodules of calcium mineralization was appreciable. the number and size of these aggregates increased in the following days. cells directly cultured in osteogenic medium  reached 70–75% confluence after  <dig> days from withdrawal, and became over confluent in the following days . in the following days the appearance of the first aggregates of calcium mineralization was observed . alizarin red staining confirmed the presence of biomineralization . an increase in the number and size of aggregates during the time was observed also in these cultures . cell count carried out on  <dig> cultures performed with protocol  <dig> at day  <dig> from withdrawal demonstrated the presence of cell number ranging from  <dig>  ×  <dig>  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells.

rt-pcr analysis carried out at day  <dig>  or  <dig>  from withdrawal, showed expression of col <dig>  onc, opn, ocn, opg, bsp and runx <dig>  typical markers of the osteogenic differentiation . the same genes were not expressed in fresh amniotic fluid samples, analyzed as negative control .

in order to evaluate the growth ability of osteoblastic cells obtained by protocol  <dig> on different surfaces commonly used in oral implantology, cultures were carried out on smooth copper, machined titanium and sandblasted and acid etching titanium  test disks, and evaluated using electron scanning microscopy. titanium is universally considered as the first-rate material for oral osseointegrated implantology. additional treatments on commercially pure  titanium surface provide further enhancement of bone-to-implant contact, thus reducing the osseointegration period, improving treatment outcome and increasing applicability to poor bone quality. the investigation of implants with different surface treatments, both in vitro and in vivo, is a crucial point in order to define the surface morphology which could permit a good osteoblastic cell proliferation and osseointegration around implant. in our experiments, adherent cells were not detected on smooth copper surface  at day  <dig>  while different behaviour of osteoblastic-like cells were observed on machined titanium and sla titanium surfaces. on machined titanium surfaces, few adherent cells were observed around the titanium disk. on the contrary, adherent cells were found to cover the whole surface of sla titanium disk . cell aggregates were arranged almost uniformly and formed a single layer cell culture on the disk surface . at high magnification philophodia surrounding cell surfaces were clearly visible .

in order to evaluate the mitotic stability of cells, cytogenetic investigation was carried out on protocol  <dig> cultures at day  <dig>  showing normal diploid karyotype in all the investigated metaphases.

discussion
different protocols have been reported in literature for the differentiation of osteogenic cells starting from amniotic fluid. some authors reported the use of immunoselection with c-kit specific antibodies in order to isolate afs starting from confluent human amniocentesis cultures, followed by proliferation of afmscs under appropriate culture conditions, and finally osteoblastic differentiation after several days of culture  <cit> . on the other hand, other groups cultured unselected amniotic fluid cells in media allowing the proliferation of afmscs, and subsequently induced their differentiation in osteoblastic cells  <cit> .

in the present study, we demonstrated the ability of human afs to differentiate into osteogenic cells using a single step culture procedure, allowing a  <dig> days reduction of the culture time as compared to previously reported protocols. this could represent an important point in the view of a possible therapeutic application of these cells. amniotic fluid samples, directly resuspended in osteogenic medium without the selection of afmscs, were able to produce osteogenic cells after  <dig> days from the withdrawal as demonstrated by alizarin red staining. rt-pcr analysis showed the full expression of all osteogenic markers typical of late stage osteoblasts after  <dig> days of colture, while the same expression pattern is showed after  <dig> days from withdrawal by cells obtained using conventional protocols. cytogenetic investigation, carried out at day  <dig> on cells obtained by the single step protocol, showed normal diploid karyotype in all the investigated samples, thus confirming the mitotic stability of cells obtained using this procedure. cell count performed on cultures carried out with protocol  <dig> showed the presence at day  <dig> from withdrawal of about  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells starting from as little as 2– <dig> ml of amniotic fluid. although the direct culture of afs cells in osteogenic medium likely induces a complete cell differentiation within  <dig> days, with arrest of cell proliferation, the amount of cells obtained with this protocol fits well with the cell number required for preclinical studies in animal models and for local transplant in human. since this latter approach would likely represent the gold standard for a future clinical application in odontoiatric and orthopaedic implantology, the cell number obtained using our direct protocol appears to be sufficient for future local therapeutic purposes.

in order to test the ability of osteoblastic cells obtained from amniotic fluid to proliferate onto surfaces commonly used for craniofacial implantology, and to evaluate their usefulness for tissue engineering, we tested these cells on disks with machined titanium and sla titanium surfaces. electron microscopy observation showed a good growth and adherence of osteoblastic cells on this latter surface. this result indicates the excellent biocompatibility of osteoblastic cells obtained from amniotic fluid with sla titanium scaffolds currently utilized in dental implant.

CONCLUSIONS
the protocol described in the present study shows the ability of producing osteoblastic cells from amniotic fluid samples in a very short time, being these cells fully differentiated within one month from withdrawal. although osteoblastic progenitors can be successfully obtained from bone marrow stromal cells, the use of amniotic fluid as a source of these cells is of relevance since afs can be easily obtained from routine clinical amniocentesis specimens that would otherwise be discarded. thus, it is possible to suggest that banking of these stem cells will provide in the future a relevant source both for autologous therapy in the adulthood and for the transplant in hla matched recipients.
