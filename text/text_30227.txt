BACKGROUND
acquired resistance, or "immunization" of plants was originally documented more than seventy years ago in a review published by kenneth chester in which varying degrees of immunity were observed in plants that had recovered from an initial pathogen attack  <cit> . the term systemic acquired resistance  was originally used by ross to describe systemic resistance induced by necrosis-causing viruses in tobacco  <cit>  and is more generally defined as a defense mechanism induced by a localized infection that results in broad-spectrum resistance in distant tissues to normally virulent pathogens  <cit> .

research using tobacco, cucumber and, more recently, arabidopsis models indicates that sar occurs in distinct stages. the first, or induction, stage is initiated when a necrosis-causing pathogen infects a leaf and results in either the formation of a localized hypersensitive response  and local resistance, or in disease-induced necrosis  <cit> . a recent report demonstrated systemic immunity in the absence of necrotic cell death in the induced leaf  <cit> , highlighting the fact that the precise cellular mechanisms governing the initiation of sar are still unclear. formation of the necrotic lesion results in a  <dig> to 50-fold accumulation above basal levels of the plant defense hormone, salicylic acid , <cit>  and in the expression of pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> 

during the initiation stage of sar, a mobile signal or signals is induced to travel and is later perceived in distant, uninfected tissues. several lines of evidence indicate that the signal travels through the phloem, including girdling experiments in tobacco that reduce the translocation of molecules through phloem tissue. additionally, the pattern of sucrose transport from source to sink leaves in arabidopsis was similar to transport of the sar signal from induced leaves to protect upper leaves against pseudomonas syringae pv maculicola . although these and other experiments  suggest the sar signal is phloem-mobile, cell-to-cell movement down the petiole, or a combination of these two modes of transport cannot be ruled out.

the discovery that sa levels in the phloem rise dramatically in sar-induced tobacco  <cit>  and cucumber  <cit>  led to the hypothesis that sa itself may be a sar mobile signal  <cit> . sa was shown to be critically involved in the sar pathway because transgenic tobacco plants expressing a salicylate hydroxylase gene  were unable to accumulate sa or to manifest a sar response  <cit> . however, a number of experiments provide evidence that sa is not a sar mobile signal. cucumber plants in which induced leaves were detached prior to the accumulation of sa in their petioles still manifested a sar response in systemic tissue  <cit> . furthermore, grafting experiments utilizing transgenic nahg tobacco demonstrated that nahg-expressing rootstocks blocked in the accumulation of sa were nonetheless competent to translocate a mobile signal to the scion  <cit> .

the establishment phase of sar involves the perception of the mobile signal in distant tissue, resulting in a modest accumulation of sa and expression of pr genes in arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> . in the final, or manifestation, stage of sar, the plant responds to normally virulent pathogens in a resistant manner  <cit> . manifestation of sar is associated with the expression and activity of a set of sar genes  <cit>  including the previously described pr genes. an earlier, more rapid or more abundant accumulation of these sar proteins may be the molecular basis for systemic resistance. the physiological function of many of these genes has not been determined but increases in peroxidase activity in induced cucumber  <cit> , chitinase activity in arabidopsis and cucumber  <cit> , as well as antifungal properties in vitro  <cit>  suggest that these proteins play a role in producing a resistant state.

isolation and characterization of arabidopsis mutants has been a powerful approach to decipher the mechanism of sar. by screening a collection of t-dna tagged arabidopsis lines for mutants that fail to develop sar following induction with avirulent pseudomonas syringae pv tomato , the defective in induced resistance 1- <dig>  mutant was identified  <cit> . the dir1- <dig> mutant was not compromised in basal resistance and, interestingly, overexpression of dir <dig> did not enhance disease resistance or lead to a constitutive sar response. petiole exudates, enriched for phloem sap, collected from sar-induced wild-type leaves were effective in inducing the sar marker gene pr- <dig> when infiltrated into wild-type or dir1- <dig> plants, suggesting that the long-distance sar signal was present in these wild type petiole exudates and that dir1- <dig> can perceive this signal. however, exudates similarly collected from dir1- <dig> leaves were incapable of inducing pr- <dig> expression in wild-type leaves, suggesting that this mutant is defective either in the synthesis of the sar mobile signal or its transport to distant leaves  <cit> . these data and the fact that dir <dig> encodes a putative lipid transfer protein led to the hypothesis that dir <dig> is involved in long distance signaling and may chaperone a lipid signal to distant leaves during sar  <cit> .

lipid transfer proteins  are ubiquitous in plants and are associated with many developmental and stress response processes  <cit> . the structure of a number of ltps has been determined revealing that they possess a consensus motif of eight cysteine residues engaged in four disulphide bridges forming a central hydrophobic cavity which can bind long chain fatty acids  <cit> . lascombe et al.  <cit>  determined the structure and lipid binding properties of dir <dig> expressed in the yeast pichia pastoris using fluorescence and x-ray diffraction. dir <dig> shares some structural and lipid binding properties with the ltp <dig> family. in vitro, dir <dig> can bind two monoacylated phospholipids and contains two proline-rich sh <dig> domains. sh <dig> domains participate in protein-protein interactions in numerous proteins  <cit> . lascombe et al. postulate that the dir <dig> sh <dig> domains may play a role in interacting with the putative sar signal receptor in distant leaves. a number of studies implicate glycerolipids  <cit> , methyl salicylate  and azelaic acid  as sar long distance signal candidates  <cit> . overexpression/sar studies in dir1- <dig> identified two tobacco dir <dig> orthologs indicating that dir <dig> is important for sar in both arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> . a recent paper by chanda et al.  <cit>  provides evidence suggesting that glycerol-3-phosphate  may also be a sar long distance signal.

if dir <dig> is chaperoning a signal to distant leaves during sar, we hypothesize that dir <dig> accesses sieve elements for long distance movement. therefore, dir <dig> promoter transgenic lines were investigated to localize dir <dig> in leaves at the cellular and subcellular levels in healthy untreated plants and during sar. our results indicate that the dir <dig> promoter directs constitutive expression in seedlings and all leaf cell types. moreover, although dir <dig> expression is reduced upon sar induction, dir <dig> is still expressed in all living cell types comprising the vascular tissue.

RESULTS
localization of dir <dig> in leaves during sar
previous rna and protein gel blot expression studies indicated that dir <dig> is expressed constitutively at low levels in rosette leaves of  <dig> to  <dig> week old plants and its expression is reduced after sar induction  <cit> . if dir <dig> is involved in the long distance signaling stage of the sar pathway, it is possible that dir <dig> is expressed in the phloem, specifically companion cells, providing it direct access to the phloem for long distance movement. moreover, expression limited to the phloem would be consistent with low dir <dig> rna and protein levels observed in whole leaves  <cit> . dir <dig> expression in leaves was examined using the ß-glucuronidase  reporter gene. the gus reporter was chosen to amplify the weak dir <dig> expression signal and allow visualization of dir <dig> expression in various tissues and at the cellular level. transgenic plant lines were created in which the dir <dig> promoter region was placed upstream of gus in wild-type  plants or upstream of a dir1-gus fusion in the dir1- <dig> mutant background . a number of plant lines were examined at four weeks post germination  for gus activity before and during sar. dir1pro:gus in ws lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and dir1pro:dir1-gus in dir1- <dig> lines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were mock-inoculated , inoculated with sar-inducing avirulent pst  or left untreated. similar results were observed in all plant lines  inoculated leaves and uninoculated systemic leaves from the same plant were collected at  <dig> or  <dig> hours post inoculation , stained for gus activity and observed using light microscopy. under low magnification, abundant gus activity was observed in untreated and mock-inoculated leaves in the vasculature and mesophyll cells in both the dir1pro:gus- <dig> and dir1pro:dir1-gus- <dig> lines. in contrast, less intense gus staining was observed in inoculated and systemic leaves of both transgenic lines  inoculated with avirulent pst . due to differences in cell density and vacuole size of cells in the midvein, secondary vein and mesophyll, it is not possible to compare gus activity levels between these tissues. therefore gus activity was measured separately in each of these tissues using a relative scale of  <dig> to  <dig>  where  <dig> represents little to no gus activity and  <dig> represents intense gus activity or staining  to quantify the observed reduction in gus activity observed in figure 1a. intense staining occurred in the midvein and secondary veins in mock-inoculated or untreated leaves of both the dir1pro:gus- <dig> and dir1pro:dir1-gus- <dig> lines, whereas the level of gus activity was reduced in inoculated and uninoculated systemic leaves of plants inoculated with sar-inducing pst . a similar reduction in gus activity was observed in mesophyll cells of inoculated or systemic leaves collected from plants induced for sar compared to untreated or mock-inoculated leaves . comparable results for dir1pro:gus- <dig> in ws and dir1pro:dir1-gus- <dig> in dir1- <dig> are presented as additional files  <dig>  and  <dig> 

these studies indicate that the dir <dig> promoter region initiates expression of gus and dir1-gus throughout the leaf and confirms previous rna gel blot data  <cit>  that dir <dig> expression is reduced after sar induction with pst . dir <dig> expression in the vasculature was examined in more detail to determine if dir <dig> is expressed in phloem cells using both dir1pro:dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig> and dir1pro:gus-11/ws lines. gus-stained leaf and petiole midveins from  <dig> week-old plants were embedded, sectioned and viewed under high magnification. gus activity was present in all living cell types including the developing xylem tracheary elements, xylem parenchyma, phloem and phloem parenchyma in midveins of untreated, mock-inoculated, inoculated and systemic leaves from plants induced for sar . dir <dig> expression was reduced, but still detectable in all cell types of the midvein in leaves induced for sar, including both companion cells and sieve elements of the phloem . dir1-gus activity was also observed in all cells of untreated petiole midveins . therefore, dir <dig> is expressed in the phloem before and during sar induction and may access the phloem for long distance movement during sar.

expression of dir <dig> in seedlings, roots and flowers was also examined using the dir1pro-dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig> line. dir1-gus activity was observed throughout seven-day old seedlings including the roots, trichomes and in flowers and flower bolts of mature plants .

reduction in dir <dig> expression during sar induction is pst-dependent
a number of studies have demonstrated that virulence effectors delivered by the type iii secretion system  of pst are involved in suppressing arabidopsis cell wall-mediated basal resistance which includes the formation of cell wall callose appositions near pst colonies and the expression of a number of secreted proteins including some ltps  <cit> . we hypothesized that the reduction in dir <dig> expression after inoculation with pst observed in this and our previous study  <cit>  could be the result of t3ss delivery of virulence effectors into the plant cell. to test this hypothesis, dir <dig> expression was monitored in wild-type plants inoculated with either virulent pst or a hrps pst mutant. a high inoculum dose was used  because nonpathogenic pst hrp mutants do not reliably induce host transcriptional responses at the lower doses  <cit>  typically used in arabidopsis-pst inoculation experiments. leaves were collected at  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> hpi for rna gel blot analysis. the t3ss is not functional in hrps mutants and therefore no pst-encoded virulence effectors would be delivered into the plant cell  <cit> . dir <dig> was expressed at low levels in untreated leaves and its expression increased from  <dig> to  <dig> hpi after infection with hrps pst . in leaves inoculated with wild-type virulent pst, dir <dig> expression was reduced at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, but this suppression was attenuated by  <dig> hpi . these data demonstrate that reduction in dir <dig> observed after inoculation with pst is not a response by the plant, but rather a consequence of the delivery of pst virulence effectors into the plant cell.

to examine which cell types are affected by pst virulence effectors, dir1-gus expression in the dir1pro:dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig> line was monitored after inoculation with wild type pst and a hrpa pst mutant that does not make the major pilus protein, hrpa and therefore cannot form the t3ss hrp pilus or deliver effectors into the plant cell  <cit> . the hrpa mutant or wild-type virulent or avirulent pst  were inoculated  into dir1pro:dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig>  inoculated leaves were collected at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, stained and scored for gus activity. similar results were obtained at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, therefore just the  <dig> hpi data is presented in figure 3b and 3c. mock-inoculated leaves and leaves from plants inoculated with hrpa pst displayed high gus activity in the midvein, secondary vein and mesophyll cells compared to leaves inoculated with virulent  or avirulent pst . these visual results were corroborated by determining the relative gus activity using the subjective gus scale as described above. gus activity was reduced in the midvein, secondary vein and mesophyll cells in leaves inoculated with either avirulent or virulent pst as compared to leaves inoculated with hrpa pst . therefore inoculation with virulent or avirulent pst leads to suppression of dir <dig> expression in the midvein, secondary vein and mesophyll cells of leaves in a t3ss-dependent manner.

dir <dig> is targeted to the cell wall
lipid transfer proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum  and secretory pathway as preproteins under the direction of a short, n-terminal er entry peptide of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids that is cleaved after entry into the er. the mature proteins are secreted outside the cell and are typically associated with cell walls  <cit> , although several of these proteins have been discovered intracellularly within protein storage vacuoles or glyoxisomes  <cit> . the functionality of the predicted dir <dig> signal sequence was examined by agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation with t-dna encoding full-length dir <dig> fused to the eyfp  reporter , truncated dir <dig> lacking the putative signal sequence fused to eyfp  or 35s:eyfp into nicotiana tobaccum followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy to localize eyfp fusion proteins in tobacco leaf epidermal cells.

localization of dir1Δ1-25-eyfp was identical to that of the eyfp control, such that fluorescence was observed in  <dig> of  <dig> cells at the cell periphery, in cytoplasmic strands and also within the nucleus . detection of these proteins in the nucleus was likely due to passive diffusion from the cytosol. the  <dig> kda eyfp protein, as well as the dir1Δ1-25-eyfp fusion are smaller than the  <dig> kda exclusion limit of nuclear pores  <cit>  such that nuclear detection of cytosolic fluorescent fusion proteins is commonly observed in plant cells  <cit> . dir1-eyfp exhibited two distinct patterns of localization. in a small number of cells , dir1-eyfp was detected in a discrete network particularly enriched near the plasma membrane  coincident with the cortical er. in a majority of cells, , dir1-eyfp was localized to the nuclear and cell periphery . tobacco epidermal cells have a large central vacuole largely restricting the cytoplasm to a thin layer near cell boundaries, making it difficult to distinguish between plasma membrane and cell wall localization. to confirm that dir1-eyfp was secreted to the cell wall, cells were counterstained with propidium iodide, a dye which accumulates in the apoplast as it is excluded by intact plasma membranes  <cit> . dir1-eyfp partially colocalized  with the propidium iodide signal , demonstrating that the signal sequence directed secretion of dir1-eyfp out of tobacco epidermal cells into the cell wall. patches of dir1-eyfp signal did not colocalize with propidium iodide, but rather with regions surrounding the nucleus and the cell periphery indicating that some dir <dig> molecules localize to the er secretory system and perhaps the cytosol.

transgenic lines that express dir <dig> lacking its signal sequence in the dir1- <dig> mutant  were constructed and used to demonstrate the functionality of the dir <dig> signal sequence in arabidopsis. a number of lines were characterized  and line  <dig> was chosen for further study. gus activity in the leaves of 35spro: dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> line was monitored by inoculating leaves with  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> pst  followed by gus staining at  <dig> hpi. similar to dir <dig> promoter-directed expression , gus activity in the 35spro: dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> line was higher in untreated and mock-inoculated leaves compared to leaves inoculated with avirulent pst . dir1Δ1-25-gus was expressed in all cell types of the leaves similar to dir <dig> promoter-driven expression of dir1-gus. these data indicate that expression from the 35s promoter, like that from the dir <dig> promoter region, is reduced in response to inoculation with pst. however, unlike dir <dig> promoter-directed expression, 35s promoter-directed expression of dir1Δ1-25-gus in the midvein and secondary vein of systemic leaves of inoculated plants was similar to untreated or mock-inoculated leaves . other researchers have also observed a reduction in 35s promoter-driven expression after pathogen inoculation. for example, expression of gus in 35s:gus transgenic pear was significantly reduced following infection with erwinia amylovora  <cit>  and in arabidopsis and tobacco roots following infection with heterodera and globodera nematodes  <cit> .

to demonstrate that the dir <dig> signal sequence does target dir <dig> to the cell wall in arabidopsis, intercellular washing fluids  were collected from dir1pro:dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig> and 35s:dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> untreated leaves from  <dig> week old plants. iwfs consist of cell wall associated proteins and molecules and provide information about the soluble molecules associated with plant cell walls  <cit> . iwfs collected from dir1pro:dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig> and 35s:dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> leaves were assayed for gus activity . iwfs from dir1Δ1-25-gus plants displayed low gus activity while iwfs from dir1-gus plants displayed high gus activity . therefore when dir <dig> possesses its native signal sequence, dir1-gus activity is detected in iwfs which are enriched for soluble cell wall proteins. however, little gus activity was detected when the native dir <dig> signal sequence was removed. these results corroborate the tobacco immunofluorescence analysis demonstrating that the native dir <dig> signal sequence targets dir <dig> to the cell wall in arabidopsis.

expression of dir1-gus or dir1Δ1-25-gus rescues the sar defect in dir1-1
we hypothesize that dir <dig> may be involved in long distance signaling during sar and travel cytoplasmically via the phloem and/or cell to cell. evidence to date indicates that proteins destined to travel in the phloem in arabidopsis are made in companion cells and enter sieve elements via companion cell-sieve element plasmodesmata  <cit> . however, dir <dig> is targeted to the cell wall via the secretory system and according to current cell biology knowledge, dir <dig> would have no access to the cytosol and plasmodesmata. we hypothesize that dir1's targeting signal sequence is cleaved or becomes nonfunctional upon sar induction allowing it to remain in the cytosol with access to plasmodesmata. if this was true, then dir <dig> without its signal sequence may still function during sar. to test this hypothesis, sar assays were performed with dir1pro:dir1-gus-29/dir1- <dig> and 35s:dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> lines plus ws and dir1- <dig>  plants were either induced for sar with  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> pst  or mock-inoculated on two lower leaves, followed by challenge inoculation with  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> virulent pst in distant leaves two day later. bacterial densities were monitored in challenged leaves at  <dig> dpi. wild-type ws plants were sar-competent as demonstrated by the 10-fold reduction in pst levels in plants induced for sar versus those that were mock-inoculated, while the dir1- <dig> mutant displayed high levels of pst in plants that were or were not induced for sar . both transgenic lines expressing either dir1-gus or dir1Δ1-25-gus were sar competent as demonstrated by the 6-fold and 4-fold decrease, respectively, in pst levels in induced versus mock-inoculated plants . a replicate experiment is shown in figure 6b in which the transgenic lines displayed a 7- to 8-fold sar response compared to 5-fold in ws. results similar to figures 6a and 6b were observed using additional transgenic lines  providing evidence that expression of dir1-gus or dir1Δ1-25-gus restores the sar defect in the dir1- <dig> mutant. more importantly, these data suggest that removal of the dir <dig> signal sequence has no deleterious effect on dir1's ability to participate in sar.

discussion
the non-specific lipid transfer proteins  comprise a large, multigene family present in numerous plant species  <cit> . ltps are basic polypeptides of approximately 7- <dig> kd, whose key structural feature is the ltp fold formed by four disulphide bridges between eight conserved cysteine residues  <cit> . the ltp fold forms a tunnel-like cavity and in vitro studies indicate it accommodates various lipids, including phospholipids, fatty acids, glycolipids, prostaglandin and jasmonic acid  <cit> . due to their ability to bind lipids in vitro, ltps were originally hypothesized to traffick lipids between intracellular membranes  <cit> . however, this function seems unlikely as a number of ltps have been demonstrated to be synthesized as preproteins containing an er signal sequence such that the mature proteins are secreted to the apoplast  <cit> .

although the biochemical mechanisms involved are not clear, ltp proteins play important roles in plant defense against pathogens. several ltps exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro  <cit>  and overexpression of select ltp or ltp-like proteins leads to enhanced local resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens in arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> . dir <dig> is the first ltp protein whose function in pathogen resistance is defined genetically, as the dir1- <dig> arabidopsis mutant is impaired in systemic resistance to pst  but local resistance responses remain intact. furthermore, 35s promoter-mediated overexpression of dir <dig> does not lead to enhanced basal resistance or a more robust sar response  <cit> , strongly suggesting that dir <dig> does not participate directly in defense against pst, but instead plays a role in systemic disease signaling.

the overall goal of this study was to investigate the signaling role of dir <dig> during sar by localizing it at the tissue, cellular and subcellular levels. a number of transgenic lines were created in which the dir <dig> promoter region was placed upstream of gus or a dir1-gus fusion in ws and dir1- <dig>  respectively. examination of these lines indicated that the dir <dig> promoter region initiated expression of gus and dir1:gus in seedlings, roots and floral tissues and in all living cells including the veins and mesophyll cells of untreated and mock-inoculated leaves. this was somewhat unexpected as we had hypothesized that dir <dig> expression might be limited to the vasculature which would explain the constitutive, but low levels of dir <dig> expression observed in leaves  <cit> , while still providing dir <dig> access to the phloem for movement during sar. during sar induction, dir1-gus expression was reduced in mesophyll cells and vascular tissue of inoculated and distant systemic leaves of plants induced with sar-inducing pst . rna gel-blots  <cit>  revealed that dir <dig> transcript levels declined following sar induction in leaves. therefore reduced gus activity observed in sar-induced dir1pro:gus transgenic plants is the result of decreased transcription driven by the dir <dig> promoter region.

reduction in dir <dig> expression could be part of the sar response or could be due to pst-derived effector molecules delivered into plant cells. to test this hypothesis, expression of dir <dig> in leaves inoculated with sar-inducing avirulent pst, virulent pst, or with a pst hrps mutant, was determined using rna gel blot analysis. dir <dig> expression was reduced in leaves inoculated with virulent pst at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, however by  <dig> hpi, dir <dig> expression was no longer suppressed. reduction in dir <dig> expression was not observed in leaves inoculated with pst hrps. instead, dir <dig> transcripts accumulated abundantly at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi. a high inoculum dose was used  because nonpathogenic pst hrp mutants do not reliably induce host transcriptional responses at the lower doses  <cit>  typically used in arabidopsis-pst inoculation experiments. similar experiments with the dir1pro:gus or dir1pro:dir1-gus plant lines using a lower inoculum level  demonstrated that pst hrp-dependent suppression of dir <dig> expression occurs in the midvein, secondary veins and mesophyll cells at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. numerous in planta bacterial growth studies have demonstrated that the infection process proceeds faster in high compared to low dose experiments  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that the difference in timing of suppression of dir <dig> expression in these two experiments is due to the high versus low inoculum doses used.

collectively, these data suggest that suppression of dir <dig> expression occurs through the action of effector molecules delivered through the pst t3ss. this supports numerous studies in which genes associated with arabidopsis cell wall defense, including a number of ltps, are suppressed in a pst hrp-dependent manner  <cit> . transcriptional mechanisms are involved in the pst-mediated downregulation of dir <dig> expression in dir1pro:dir1-gus and 35s:dir1Δ1-25-gus- <dig> lines, but it is also possible that post-transcriptional mechanisms or dir1-gus instability contribute to the observed expression patterns.

hrp-dependent suppression of dir <dig> occurs in all cell types within inoculated leaves and in distant uninoculated leaves. recently it was discovered that pseudomonas syringae suppresses plant defenses not only in the infected leaf but also in systemic tissues, rendering the plant more susceptible to subsequent infection, a phenomenon known as systemic induced susceptibility   <cit> . sis observed after pseudomonas infection of arabidopsis requires the bacterial toxin coronatine  <cit> , a structural and functional mimic of the defense hormone jasmonic acid  <cit> . interestingly, pst hrp mutants are deficient in the production of coronatine  <cit> . reduction of dir <dig> expression in systemic tissue may therefore involve the action of widely mobile, bacterially produced molecules such as coronatine.

dir <dig> expression in the vasculature was examined in more detail to determine if dir <dig> has access to the phloem and therefore the potential for movement to distant leaves, a key characteristic of a sar long distance signal. microscopic examination of leaf and petiole cross-sections demonstrated that dir1-gus expression was observed in all living cell types including developing xylem, xylem parenchyma, mesophyll, phloem parenchyma and phloem. mature xylem tracheary elements are dead, and as expected appeared empty with no detectable gus activity. dir <dig> expression was reduced but still detectable after sar induction in all living cell types including companion cells and phloem sieve elements. therefore dir <dig> is present at the right place  and the right time  to participate in long distance signaling during sar.

the subcellular localization of dir <dig> and the functionality of dir1's predicted signal sequence were examined by transiently expressing dir1-eyfp fusion proteins in tobacco epidermal cells followed by visualization using confocal microscopy. as expected, eyfp alone and a fusion construct lacking the predicted er signal sequence  localized to cytosolic strands and diffused into the nucleus while intact dir1-eyfp localized to the er, cell periphery and showed colocalization with propidium iodide, an apoplastic marker. dir1-gus activity was detected in intercellular washing fluids from plants expressing wild type dir <dig>  but gus activity was greatly reduced in iwfs collected from plants expressing dir <dig> lacking the signal sequence, corroborating the dir1-eyfp tobacco localization experiments. therefore, the dir <dig> signal sequence does direct secretion of dir <dig> to the cell wall as has been previously observed for other ltps  <cit> , similar results were also obtained in a recent paper in which dir-gfp transiently expressed in nicotiana benthamiana was observed to localize to the er  <cit> . it is difficult to distinguish the plasma membrane from the cell wall using light microscopy  <cit>  and this may explain why chanda et al.  <cit>  concluded that dir <dig> is not secreted to the cell wall. we chose to examine intercellular washing fluids for the presence of dir1-gus for two reasons: to overcome the light-microscopy-associated problem of distinguishing the plasma membrane from the cell wall and to demonstrate that dir <dig> is secreted to the cell wall in both tobacco and arabidopsis.

evidence to date indicates that arabidopsis proteins destined to travel in the phloem are synthesized in companion cells and move into sieve elements through plasmodesmata  <cit> . patches of intracellular dir1:eyfp were detected in this study, however it is difficult to distinguish the cytosol from the er and the secretory system. nevertheless, these data support the idea that some dir <dig> protein is present in the cytosol and therefore gains access to the phloem through the cytosol of companion cells. alternatively, dir <dig> could enter the cytosol if the function of the signal sequence is disrupted during sar induction. it is also possible that pathogen-induced cell membrane disruption during the hr  may allow cell wall proteins including dir <dig> to enter cells. in any case, we hypothesized that cytosolic localization of a pool of dir <dig> is required for translocation of the long-distance sar signal. to address this question, a transgenic line was created in which the signal sequence was deleted from dir <dig> . we chose to use the 35s promoter in the signal sequence lines and the native dir <dig> promoter in the dir1pro:dir1-gus/dir1- <dig> lines because our data indicated that dir <dig> expression was very low in wild type plants  <cit> , and we wanted to increase the chance of observing dir1-gus in at least one of our lines. in retrospect, this was not necessary as dir <dig> expression was observed in the dir1pro:dir1-gus/dir1- <dig> lines, however space and funding constraints made it necessary to work with the 35s: dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> lines. little dir1Δ1-25-gus was detected in iwfs collected from 35s:dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> plants. additionally, removal of the signal sequence restricted expression of a dir1-eyfp fusion to the cytosol in tobacco cells. expression of dir <dig> without its er signal sequence rescued the sar defect in dir1- <dig> to the same extent as the entire protein . these experiments suggest that restricting dir <dig> to the cytosol does not impair sar and supports the idea that cytosolic localization of dir <dig> is important during the induction stage of sar. however, we can not rule out the possibility that higher levels of dir1Δ1-25-gus produced from the 35s promoter are responsible for the sar competent phenotype observed in 35s: dir1Δ1-25-gus-5/dir1- <dig> lines.

CONCLUSIONS
dir <dig>  like a number of other arabidopsis ltps, is expressed in seedlings, leaves, roots and flowers  <cit>  and contains a signal sequence that directs it to the cell wall. additionally, dir <dig> is upregulated during the basal resistance response to pst hrp mutants in a manner similarly observed in other plant-microbe systems  <cit> . our results also confirm previous expression studies that ltps in arabidopsis are the targets of hrp-dependent suppression by pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . although dir <dig> expression is suppressed by pst, dir <dig> is still detected in companion cells during the sar induction stage and restriction of dir <dig> to the cytosol does not impair sar, suggesting that dir <dig> gains access to sieve elements for transport to distant leaves during sar. in other words, dir <dig> is perfectly situated to participate in long distance signaling during sar.
