BACKGROUND
during drosophila oogenesis, germ-line and soma cells are known to interact intimately with each other, for example concerning follicle organization, vitellogenesis and egg-shell production  <cit> . in many cases, however, the exact routes of information exchange have remained elusive. during establishment of the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes, intercellular communication between germ-line and soma cells has been shown to be essential as well. besides other mechanisms, e.g. contact of membrane receptors and their ligands  <cit> , the transfer of small molecules via gap junctions might be involved in such communication processes.

in recent years, gap-junction mediated cell-cell communication in drosophila has gained growing attention, as several mutants have been described in which specific developmental defects are correlated with altered gap-junction plaques or channels  <cit> . in arthropods, the coordination of physiological and developmental processes by means of gap-junctional communication  <cit>  might be even more important than in vertebrates, since the channels of arthropods allow the exchange of molecules of up to  <dig> d  <cit> . in special cases, even much larger molecules, e.g. calmodulin, seem to be able to pass through gap junctions  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that gene expression can be regulated by neighbouring cells through the exchange of sirnas via gap junctions  <cit> .

while vertebrates use connexins for the assembly of gap-junction channels   <cit> , the main gap-junction proteins found in invertebrates are members of the innexin family  <cit> . however, additional proteins have been detected: the innexin-related pannexins  <cit>  and the ductins  <cit> . neither innexins nor pannexins have homologies with either connexins or ductins. while pannexins were found only in vertebrates, ductins were observed in gap junctions of vertebrates as well as invertebrates. in some studies on insect gap junctions, further proteins have been deteced  <cit> .

the ovarian follicle of drosophila consists of a group of  <dig> germ-line cells surrounded by a layer of somatic follicle cells . the oocyte and its  <dig> nurse cells form a cytoplasmic continuum via intercellular bridges as well as via gap junctions, and the same holds true for the follicle cells. with the germ-line cells, however, the follicle cells are only connected via gap junctions, that have been found to vary in structure and size during the course of oogenesis  <cit> . by way of the intercellular distribution of microinjected fluorescent tracers, we have previously revealed stage-specific communication between oocyte and follicle cells. a variety of treatments has been found to either inhibit or to stimulate dye-coupling, e.g. acidic ph, high intracellular , octanol, dinitrophenol, a juvenile hormone analogue or 20-hydroxyecdysone  <cit> .

of the eight known drosophila innexins, the mrnas of innexins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were detected in the ovary  <cit> . so far, only for innexin  <dig> the localization and functioning of the protein during early oogenesis have been analyzed  <cit> . we investigated by immunoblots and immunohistochemistry the occurrence and detailed localization of innexins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> throughout oogenesis. our results suggest that all analyzed innexins are involved in the formation of ovarian gap junctions.

in order to test whether innexins form intercellular communication channels in the ovary, we microinjected various innexin antisera in combination with the fluorescent tracer lucifer yellow into the oocyte of stage- <dig> follicles. we found that only innexin- <dig> antibodies were able to significantly reduce the dye-coupling observed between oocyte and follicle cells. therefore, innexin  <dig> is involved in cell-cell communication between germ-line and soma cells by participating in gap-junction hemichannels residing in the oolemma.

we further analyzed the developmental capacities of follicles following microinjections of innexin- <dig> antibodies. since oogenesis in vitro was affected in a significant fraction of microinjected follicles, we conclude that cell-cell communication via innexin-2-containing gap junctions is essential for various processes of normal follicle development through stages  <dig> to  <dig> 

methods
antisera
for immunocytochemical and immunoblot analysis as well as for microinjections, we used the following anti-peptide sera, which have been raised against cytoplasmic regions  of different innexins from drosophila melanogaster:  a rabbit antiserum to the c-terminus of innexin  <dig>   <cit> ,  two rabbit antisera to different regions of the c-terminus of innexin  <dig>  and ainx2rb-ct  <cit> ),  a guinea-pig antiserum to the cytoplasmic loop of innexin  <dig> ,  a guinea-pig antiserum to the c-terminus of innexin  <dig> ,  a rabbit antiserum to the cytoplasmic loop of innexin  <dig>   <cit> ,  a rabbit antiserum to the c-terminus of innexin  <dig>   <cit> , and  as a control, a rabbit non-immune serum . the antisera to innexins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were kindly provided by r. bauer and m. hoch , whilst the antiserum to innexin  <dig> was a gift from s. tazuke .

preparation of follicles
drosophila melanogaster wild-type oregon r flies were reared at about 20°c on standard food with additional fresh yeast. individual females of 2– <dig> days old were killed by crushing the thorax with tweezers without previous etherization or chilling. for detailed analysis, follicles of various stages  <cit>  were dissected out of ovaries in drosophila pbs   <cit>  using tungsten needles.

immunoblotting
immunoblots were performed as described previously  <cit> . in short, homogenates of ovaries were sonicated and briefly boiled. the proteins were separated using 12% sds-page and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder/pbs and the blots were incubated  in 1% bsa/pbs ,  in ainx1rb-ct ,  in ainx2rb-ct,  in ainx2gp-cl ,  in ainx3gp-ct ,  in ainx3rb-cl , and  in ainx4rb-ct , respectively. subsequently, the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies , streptavidin-peroxidase  and h2o2/4-chloro-1-naphthol  were applied, and photographs were taken using a digital camera. each experiment was performed at least three times.

indirect immunofluorescence preparations
for immunostaining, follicles were fixed for  <dig> minutes at 4°c in 4% formaldehyde dissolved in pbs, washed in pbs and blocked for  <dig> hour at 20°c with 2% bsa/ <dig> % triton x-100/pbs. thereafter, the follicles were incubated overnight at 4°c  in  <dig> % bsa/ <dig> % triton x-100/pbs ,  in nis diluted 1: <dig> with  <dig> % bsa/ <dig> % triton x-100/pbs ,  in ainx1rb-ct ,  in ainx2rb-ct,  in ainx2gp-cl ,  in ainx3gp-ct ,  in ainx3rb-cl , and  in ainx4rb-ct , respectively.

after washing  <dig> times for  <dig> min, the follicles were either treated with a 1: <dig> dilution of biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit igg or with a 1: <dig> dilution of biotinylated goat-anti-guinea-pig igg  for  <dig> h at 20°c, washed again  <dig> times and incubated in a 1: <dig> dilution of streptavidin-texas red  for  <dig> min. for double-staining experiments, a 1: <dig> dilution of goat-anti-rabbit-cy <dig>  as well as a 1: <dig> dilution of donkey-anti-guinea-pig-fp <dig>  were used for  <dig> h at 20°c. washing was repeated  <dig> times, and the nuclei were stained with  <dig>  μg/ml dapi  in pbs for  <dig> min. thereafter, the follicles were either mounted in fluoromount g  and viewed in a zeiss axiovert  <dig> wide-field fluorescence  microscope equipped with a hamamatsu orca er camera, or they were mounted in glycerine/pbs 1: <dig> and viewed in a leica dmre laser-scanning microscope . each experiment was performed at least three times.

microinjection procedure and analysis of dye-coupling
stage- <dig> follicles, in which the oocyte occupies about 1/ <dig> of the follicle's volume, were carefully isolated in r- <dig> medium  <cit> . samples of 5– <dig> follicles lacking any signs of injury were washed in r- <dig> and immediately transferred to the microinjection chamber. the microinjection procedure was described previously  <cit> . in short, micropipettes were pulled from 1-mm glass capillaries containing a filament, and microinjections were carried out on an inverted epifluorescence microscope . the injection pipette  was mounted on a motorized micromanipulator equipped with a piezo translator , and coupled to a microinjector . the recipient follicle was held in place with a suction pipette  mounted on a second micromanipulator, and coupled to a screw-adjustable syringe. the volume injected into each oocyte  was in the order of  <dig> pl, which is equivalent to about 5% of the oocyte volume  <cit> .

in control experiments, the fluorescent tracer lucifer yellow ch  in distilled water) and nis , respectively, were used. in further experiments the following antisera  were microinjected:  ainx1rb-ct,  ainx2rb-ct,  ainx2rb-ct),  ainx2gp-cl,  ainx3gp-ct,  ainx3rb-cl, and  ainx4rb-ct, respectively. using the hamamatsu orca er camera, very weak levels of fluorescence were detectable in the follicular epithelium. in table  <dig>  the results of six experiments were pooled. statistical significance of differences between relative frequencies of dye-couplig was established at the α =  <dig>  level using the Χ2-test.

in-vitro development of microinjected follicles
microinjections were carried out as described above. in-vitro culture of follicles through stages 10b to  <dig> was performed in small alcohol-cleansed glass blocks containing  <dig> μl r- <dig> medium covered by an air volume of about  <dig> ml and a glass slide at 20°c in a wet chamber  <cit> . in order to test for the effects of gap-junctional blockade on follicle development, the antisera ainx2rb-ct and ainx2gp-cl were microinjected into the oocyte. non-injected follicles, follicles injected with distilled water, follicles injected with nis and follicles injected with ainx4rb-ct served as controls. photographs were taken following microinjections at stage 10b and after  <dig> hours using a nikon smz <dig> stereomicroscope equipped with a canon digital camera. staging of follicles developed in vitro was performed as described before  <cit> . in table  <dig>  the results of four experiments were pooled. for statistical evaluation the Χ2-test  was used.

RESULTS
detection of innexins in the ovary by immunoblotting
using immunoblots, we analyzed whether the mrnas of innexins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which have been described in the drosophila ovary  <cit> , become translated during oogenesis. in ovarian extracts, some of the used innexin antisera, that have all been characterized previously , revealed only weak bands at the molecular masses calculated from the amino-acid sequences of the proteins. but further bands at lower molecular masses were always detected, which are specific for the respective innexin , and which have been observed in embryonic extracts too .

the antiserum ainx1rb-ct against the c-terminus of inx <dig>  recognized a weak band at the calculateded molecular mass of  <dig> kda . two inx2-antisera, ainx2rb-ct against the c-terminus and ainx2gp-cl against the cytoplasmic loop, both recognized bands at the calculateded molecular mass of  <dig> kda , whereas the reaction of ainx2rb-ct was very weak . both inx3-antisera, ainx3gp-ct against the c-terminus and ainx3rb-cl against the cytoplasmic loop, recognized bands at the calculateded molecular mass of  <dig> kda . the antiserum ainx4rb-ct against the c-terminus of inx <dig> recognized a very weak band at the calculateded molecular mass of  <dig> kda .

localization of innexins during oogenesis by immunocytochemistry
using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, we investigated the cellular localization of innexins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> during the course of drosophila oogenesis. for orientation, an overview of a stage-10b follicle is shown in fig. 1a. all antisera clearly recognized cytoplasmic as well as membranous antigens, with the exception of ainx2rb-ct, which appeared to be less suitable for whole-mount immunocytochemistry . punctate membrane labeling is presumed to represent gap-junction plaques, while diffuse or continuous membrane labeling represents either homogeniously dispersed channels or hemichannels. labeling of cytoplasmic clouds or particles is presumed to represent channel precursors. the results presented below are specific, since in control preparations, incubated without primary antibodies, no staining was observed .

we found inx <dig> predominantly localized to the baso-lateral domain of follicle cells , whereas in germ-line cells no membrane labeling was detected. inx <dig>  on the other hand, is positioned apico-laterally between follicle cells as well as apically between follicle cells and oocyte and also between follicle cells and nurse cells . inx2-labeling is present in the oolemma  and in the nurse-cell membranes . during stages  <dig> and  <dig>  when the apical follicle-cell membranes are connected with the oolemma via gap junctions located on microvilli spanning the developing vitelline membrane  <cit> , inx2-plaques are found in this region . in the nurse cells, the distribution of inx <dig> changed stage-specifically, starting with diffuse localization around the nuclei in stage 10a . during stages 10b and  <dig>  inx <dig> is observed in cytoplasmic clouds and particles , which become delivered into the growing oocyte during nurse-cell regression  <cit> .

inx <dig>  which has been shown to heteromerize with inx <dig> in embryonic epithelia  <cit> , is colocalized with inx <dig> in nurse-cell membranes as well as in lateral, but not in apical, membranes of follicle cells covering the oocyte . this contrasts with its lateral as well as apical appearance in follicle cells covering the nurse cells . in nurse cells, membrane labeling  and cytoplasmic labeling around the nuclei  was observed for inx <dig> 

inx <dig> is known to be germ-line specific  <cit> . we detected inx4-labelling in the oolemma up to stage  <dig> and in the nurse-cell membranes up to stage  <dig>  while continuous labeling was observed between nurse cells, characteristic plaques were found up to stage  <dig> in the germ-line cell membranes beneath each single follicle cell . in these membrane plaques, inx <dig> in germ-line cells appears to be in close vicinity to inx <dig> in follicle cells . inx4-plaques are also present between nurse cells and centripetally migrating follicle cells . beginning with vitellogenesis , only inx <dig>  but not inx <dig>  was detected in the oolemma .

analysis of dye-coupling following microinjections of innexin antisera
a critical test for the involvement of inx <dig> in intercellular communication between oocyte and follicle cells is the specific blockade of dye-coupling with antibodies directed against cytoplasmic regions of inx <dig>  we microinjected various antisera in combination with the fluorescent tracer lucifer yellow ch into the oocyte. for technical reasons, the youngest follicles that can be successfully microinjected are of stage  <dig>  <cit> . we used stage- <dig> follicles in the present experiment. since, beginning with stage  <dig>  only inx <dig> was detectable in the oolemma , antisera directed against other innexins served as controls .

we found the fraction of follicles showing dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells  largely reduced in comparison to nis by an antiserum directed against the intracellular c-terminus of inx <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and also, but to a minor extent, by an antiserum directed against the intracellular loop of inx <dig> . antisera directed against either inx <dig>  inx <dig> or inx <dig> did not reduce dye-coupling significantly when compared to nis . moreover, only inx2-antisera were found to reduce dye-coupling in a concentration-dependent manner . these results demonstrate that inx <dig> is involved in cell-cell communication by participating in gap-junction hemichannels residing in the oolemma. although the difference observed between the ct-specific and the cl-specific antiserum was not significant , the data suggest a prominent role of the c-terminus during closure of the pore.

in-vitro development following inhibition of gap-junctional communication
we further analyzed the developmental capacities of follicles following microinjections of inx2-antisera into the oocyte. in r- <dig> medium, stage-10b follicles are able to develop during  <dig> hours up to stage  <dig>  <cit> . when compared to nis, in-vitro development was found to be inhibited in significant fractions of follicles microinjected with either ainx2rb-ct or ainx2gp-cl . since inx <dig> is present in the oolemma only up to stage  <dig>  ainx4rb-ct served as a further control. the developmental capacities of follicles microinjected with ainx4rb-ct were not significantly different from those obtained with nis .

most of the follicles microinjected with inx2-antisera either stopped their development during stage 10b, which means that processes of follicle-cell differentiation, nurse-cell regression and oocyte growth were blocked . or these follicles failed to complete choriogenesis normally, which becomes apparent by missing respiratory appendages, incomplete chorionic layers and sizeable nurse-cell remnants  <cit> . therefore, it is obvious that communication between oocyte and follicle cells via inx2-containing gap-junction channels is essential for normal follicle development through stages  <dig> to  <dig> 

discussion
although further proteins have been detected in drosophila gap junctions  <cit> , the main invertebrate gap-junction proteins are members of the innexin family  <cit> . during oogenesis and embryogenesis, the eight known drosophila innexins show complex and overlapping expression patterns  <cit> . in the ovary, the mrnas of innexins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found. innexin mrnas  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and   <dig> were observed in the somatic follicle cells, especially in populations of migrating cells. in the oocyte and in the nurse cells, high amounts of innexin mrnas  <dig> and  <dig> were detected, whereas the expression of innexin mrnas  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was found to be rather low  <cit> .

since the mrna-expression pattern only gives hints of the distribution and function of a protein, one aim of the present study was to reveal the cellular localization of inx <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ovary. for inx <dig>  the early phases of localization and functioning have already been addressed: it is germ-line specific and plays an essential role during germ-cell differentiation in the germarium  <cit> . concerning inx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  nothing was known so far. moreover, it was not clear whether innexins form functional gap-junction channels in the ovary, and whether heteromeric channels  and/or heterotypic channels  may be involved.

during drosophila embryogenesis, the roles of inx <dig> and inx <dig> have been analyzed in detail  <cit> . both proteins participate in organizing embryonic epithelia by interacting with core proteins of adherens and septate junctions. by various experiments  <cit>  it has been shown that inx <dig> and inx <dig>  via their cytoplasmic c-terminal domains, form heterodimers, which are essential for the formation of heteromeric channels and for the integrity and polarity of the embryonic epidermis. also in a xenopus-oocyte expression system, inx <dig> formed functional heteromeric channels with inx <dig>  whereas inx <dig> alone, but not inx <dig> alone, formed homotypic channels  <cit> . in this system, also inx <dig> was found to form heteromeric channels with inx <dig> and inx <dig>  respectively, whereas inx <dig> only formed heterotypic channels with inx <dig>  <cit> .

our immunoblot analysis using various innexin anti-peptide sera, that have been characterized before , revealed the synthesis of inx <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ovary. although, in some cases, only weak bands at the calculated molecular masses were detected, further specific bands at lower molecular masses were revealed. moreover, some antisera appeared to be better suited for immunohistochemistry than for immunoblotting or vice versa. such phenomena are not unusual. for example, for inx <dig> , which is not expressed in the ovary  <cit> , only bands at lower molecular masses than deduced from the amino-acid sequence have been described  <cit> .

our immunhistochemical analysis revealed that inx <dig> is predominantly localized to the baso-lateral domain of follicle cells, whereas inx <dig> is positioned apico-laterally as well as apically between follicle cells and germ-line cells. inx <dig> was observed laterally in follicle cells and also in nurse cells, and inx <dig> was detected in the oolemma up to stage  <dig> and in nurse-cell membranes up to stage  <dig>  while inx <dig> and inx <dig> are colocalized between soma cells, inx <dig> and inx <dig> are colocalized between soma and germ-line cells.

from the analysis of drosophila mutants, inx <dig> has been inferred to exert diverse structural functions  <cit> . presumably, inx <dig> is acting indirectly through the formation of membrane channels necessary for intercellular communication. we found that dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells was largely reduced by inx2-antisera directed against both the intracellular c-terminus and the intracellular loop. analyzing in vitro the developmental capacities of follicles following microinjections of inx2-antisera revealed defects in follicle-cell differentiation, nurse-cell regression, oocyte growth and choriogenesis. also in other invertebrates, communication via gap junctions has been found to exert influence on oogenesis  <cit> .

taken together, our results suggest that inx <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are all involved in the formation of gap junctions during oogenesis. based on immunostaining and microinjection experiments , we propose the existence of a variety of channels between the three cell types:  heteromeric channels made of inx1/inx <dig> between follicle cells,  homotypic channels made of inx <dig> between follicle cells and oocyte,  homotypic channels made of inx <dig> between germ-line cells,  heteromeric channels made of inx2/inx <dig> between follicle cells,  heteromeric channels made of inx2/inx <dig> between nurse cells,  heterotypic channels made of inx2/inx <dig> between follicle cells and germ-line cells , and  heterotypic channels made of inx2/inx <dig> between germ-line cells.

in previous studies, using light and electron microscopy, we have shown that antibodies against ductin bind to antigens located in the plasma membranes and in the cytoplasm of various drosophila tissues, especially of ovarian follicles and embryos  <cit> . ductin has been found in both vacuolar-type proton pumps and gap junctions  <cit> . by microinjection experiments, we have demonstrated that antibodies directed against presumed cytoplasmic regions of ductin block dye-coupling between germ-line and soma cells and exert influence on oogenesis as well as on embryogenesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
thus, antibodies against both inx <dig> and ductin inhibit gap-junctional communication between oocyte and follicle cells in drosophila stage- <dig> follicles, and both proteins are present in the oolemma during this stage. in both cases, microinjected antibodies essentially affected normal follicle development. it remains to be clarified how innexins and ductins in gap junctions are related, and which molecules are to be exchanged between soma and germ-line cells.
