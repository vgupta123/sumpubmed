BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is an environmental gram-negative bacterium that causes a severe and often fatal disease called melioidosis. this is an important cause of sepsis in south-east asia and northern australia, a geographic distribution that mirrors the presence of b. pseudomallei in the environment  <cit> . melioidosis may develop following bacterial inoculation or inhalation and occurs most often in people with regular contact with contaminated soil and water  <cit> . clinical manifestations of melioidosis are highly variable and range from fulminant septicemia to mild localized infection. the overall mortality rate is 40% in northeast thailand  and 20% in northern australia  <cit> .

a major feature of melioidosis is that bacterial eradication is difficult to achieve. fever clearance time is often prolonged , antimicrobial therapy is required for 12- <dig> weeks, and relapse occurs in around 10% of patients despite an appropriate course of antimicrobial therapy  <cit> . the basis for persistence in the infected human host is unknown, although several observations made to date may be relevant to the clinical behaviour of this organism  <cit> . b. pseudomallei can resist the action of bactericidal substances including complement and antimicrobial peptides in human serum  <cit> . b. pseudomallei can also survive after uptake by a range of phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. macrophages have several strategies to control bacterial infection, including bacterial killing following uptake through the action of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen compounds, antimicrobial peptides and lysozomal enzymes. despite this, b. pseudomallei can invade and replicate in primary human macrophages  <cit> .

bacterial survival under adverse and rapidly changing environmental conditions is likely to be facilitated by phenotypic adaptability and plasticity. a previous study conducted by us found that 8% of primary cultures of clinical samples taken from patients with melioidosis contained more than one colony morphotype on ashdown agar. morphotypes could switch reversibly from one to another under specific conditions, and were associated with variable expression of putative virulence determinants including biofilm and flagella  <cit> . compared with parental type i , isogenic type ii  had increased biofilm and protease production, while isogenic type iii  was associated with increased flagella expression  <cit> . in vitro models suggested that switching of morphotype impacted on intracellular replication fitness after uptake by human epithelial cell line a <dig> and mouse macrophage cell line j774a. <dig>  we postulated that colony morphology switching might represent a mechanism by which b. pseudomallei can adapt within the macrophage and persist in vivo.

in this study, we investigated whether the variable phenotype associated with different morphotypes resulted in altered fitness during interactions with the human macrophage cell line u <dig> and after exposure to a range of laboratory conditions that simulate one or more conditions within the macrophage milieu. isogenic morphotypes ii and iii generated from each parental type i of  <dig> b. pseudomallei strains isolated from patients or soil were used in all experiments.

RESULTS
growth curve analysis of isogenic morphotypes
different growth rates may affect the number of intracellular bacteria following uptake by host cells. thus, prior to observation of intracellular replication in macrophages, extracellular growth of b. pseudomallei was compared between  <dig> isogenic morphotypes cultured in trypticase soy broth . using a starting inoculum of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml, log and stationary phase occurred at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, for all  <dig> morphotypes. there was no difference in doubling time between  <dig> isogenic morphotypes  with an average doubling time of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  minutes for types i, ii and iii, respectively.

replication of isogenic b. pseudomallei morphotypes in macrophages
evaluation of the initial b. pseudomallei-macrophage cell interaction using a multiplicity of infection  of 25: <dig> demonstrated that  <dig> % of the bacterial inoculum  was associated with macrophages at  <dig> h. there was no significant difference in this value between  <dig> isogenic morphotypes for all  <dig> isolates.

following removal of extracellular bacteria and incubation for a further  <dig> h,  <dig> % of the bacterial inoculum  was recovered. there was no significant difference in this value between  <dig> isogenic morphotypes for all  <dig> isolates.

the intracellular replication of b. pseudomallei between  <dig> to  <dig> h within macrophages is summarized in figure  <dig>  the replication rates for the  <dig> isogenic morphotypes of each strain obtained from two independent experiments were comparable . percent replication at  <dig> h was defined in relation to the  <dig> h time point, which was used as the reference count. analysis of pooled data for  <dig> isolates demonstrated that type i had a significantly higher rate of intracellular replication than either type ii or iii. the mean intracellular replication of type i at  <dig> h was  <dig>   times higher than that of type ii, and  <dig>   times higher than that of type iii . however, this pattern was not uniformly observed for each of the  <dig> isolates, as shown in figure 1b-f. the higher replication fitness for type i based on the summary data was largely accounted for strains  <dig> and k <dig>  other strains demonstrated a different pattern. for example, strain  <dig> type iii had a higher intracellular replication than type i, a finding that replicates those of a previous study  <cit> . the mean intracellular bacterial count also varied between individual isolates. these differences were not due to the relative sensitivities of  <dig> isogenic morphotypes to  <dig> μg/ml kanamycin, as this experimental condition removed  <dig> % of extracellular bacteria independent of type for all isolates .

susceptibility of isogenic morphotypes to acid
to examine the effect of acid, growth of  <dig> isogenic morphotypes in lb at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  was compared at each of  <dig> time points over  <dig> h of incubation. no growth difference was observed between morphotypes at any time point for ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig>  . when cultured in lb broth at ph  <dig> , all bacteria died within  <dig> h incubation.

susceptibility of isogenic morphotypes to reactive oxygen intermediates 
the susceptibility of  <dig> morphotypes to roi was initially examined on lb agar plates containing a range of h2o <dig> concentrations  . b. pseudomallei failed to grow on plates with h2o <dig> at a concentration higher than  <dig> μm, and so the percentage of viable bacteria were enumerated using agar plates with  <dig> μm h2o <dig> compared to those on plates without h2o <dig>  this demonstrated a difference in bacterial survival between the three isogenic morphotypes . percentage survival of type i was  <dig>   times higher than that for type ii, and was  <dig>   times higher than that for type iii .

further examination was undertaken of the susceptibility of the  <dig> morphotypes with a range of concentrations of h2o <dig> in lb broth. no bacteria survived in  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm h2o <dig>  in  <dig> μm h2o <dig>  type i of all  <dig> isolates multiplied from  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml  to between  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml. by contrast, all  <dig> type iii and  <dig> type ii isolates  obtained from the same experiment demonstrated no growth on the plates. this confirmed a higher resistance to h2o <dig> of parental type i compared to types ii and iii. a difference was also observed between three isogenic morphotypes in  <dig>  μm h2o <dig> . bacterial growth of type i was  <dig>   times higher than that for type ii, and was  <dig>   times higher than that for type iii.

susceptibility of isogenic morphotypes to reactive nitrogen intermediates 
susceptibility of b. pseudomallei to rni was observed following  <dig> h exposure to various concentrations of nano <dig> ranging between  <dig>  to  <dig> mm in acidified ph  <dig>  in lb broth. using a concentration of  <dig> mm nano <dig>  the percent survival of types i, ii and iii were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, with no difference observed between the three morphotypes .

susceptibility of isogenic morphotypes to lysozyme and lactoferrin
compared with initial inocula and untreated controls, treatment with  <dig> μg/ml lysozyme at ph  <dig>  did not decrease the bacterial count for the  <dig> isogenic morphotypes of b. pseudomallei, while this concentration could reduce the number of e. coli from  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml  to  <dig> cfu/ml. susceptibility was examined further in the presence of  <dig> mg/ml lactoferrin. a kinetic study over time demonstrated that lactoferrin alone could kill an entire e. coli inoculum of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml within  <dig> h at ph  <dig> . the same treatment did not affect the number of viable b. pseudomallei which was comparable to the inoculum and untreated control. adding  <dig> μg/ml lysozyme with lactoferrin did not enhance the killing efficacy of e. coli and had no effect on b. pseudomallei.

susceptibility of isogenic morphotypes to antimicrobial peptides
macrophages produce several antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . we examined the susceptibility of isogenic morphotypes to hnp- <dig>  hbd- <dig> and cathelicidin ll- <dig>  three of the main human antimicrobial peptides. the results demonstrated that  <dig> μg/ml hnp- <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml hbd- <dig> did not reduce the bacterial count for the  <dig> isogenic morphotypes of any of the b. pseudomallei isolates when compared with the initial inocula and untreated controls.

in a pilot experiment with a range of ll- <dig> concentrations and exposure times, we found that ll- <dig> reduced the b. pseudomallei count at a concentration of  <dig>  μm at  <dig> h. this condition killed 100% of a starting inoculum of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu/ml e. coli control and caused a  <dig>  to  <dig> % reduction of b. pseudomallei for different isolates. a difference in bacterial survival was observed between the three isogenic morphotypes . survival of type i was  <dig>   times higher than that for type ii, but was  <dig>   times lower than that for type iii .

growth in low oxygen concentrations
low oxygen concentration may limit the intracellular growth of aerobic bacteria within the host  <cit> . we examined the survival of  <dig> isogenic morphotypes and determined whether morphotype switching occurred in response to different oxygen concentrations during incubation on ashdown agar at 37°c. b. pseudomallei survived in 5-15% oxygen concentration for  <dig> days, with an average colony count of 95%  compared to control plates incubated in air for  <dig> days . there was no difference in the survival pattern between  <dig> isogenic morphotypes . b. pseudomallei colonies were not visible on ashdown agar after incubation in an anaerobic chamber for  <dig> weeks. the capability to recover from anaerobic conditions was observed as colonies were visible at  <dig> h after reincubation at 37°c in air, and colony counts were performed after incubation for  <dig> days. the percentage of bacteria recovered was not different between three morphotypes .

the data represents the mean of  <dig> b. pseudomallei isolates for each morphotype. the range reflected variation of % colony count between isolates. *% morphotype was the proportion of each morphotype on the plate. morphotype switching was observed for type iii  to either type i  or to type ii .

effect of laboratory conditions on morphotype switching
types i and ii did not demonstrate colony morphology variation over time in any of the conditions tested. figure  <dig> shows the effect of various testing conditions of type iii for all  <dig> isolates. between 1% and 13% of colonies subcultured from  <dig> h tsb culture onto ashdown agar switched to alternative types. the switching of type iii appeared to be important for replication in macrophages. following uptake, switching of type iii increased over time such that by the  <dig> h time point, between 48-99% of the agar plate colonies  had switched to type i  or to type ii . morphotype switching did not increase in acid, acidified sodium nitrite, or ll- <dig>  in contrast, morphotype switching from broth culture containing  <dig>  μm h2o <dig> increased over time of incubation, ranging between 24-49% of the plate colonies for different isolates. interestingly, between 15-100% of the total type iii colony count switched to an alternative morphotype after recovery from anaerobic conditions. the pattern of morphotype switching in all conditions tested was specific to isolates, with four isolates switching from type iii to type i , and one isolate switching to ii .

discussion
our previous paper reported a process of b. pseudomallei colony morphology switching that occurred during human melioidosis, and in an animal model, mouse macrophage cell line j774a. <dig>  human lung epithelial cell line a <dig>  and under starvation conditions in vitro. in this study, we investigated whether the variable phenotype associated with different morphotypes resulted in a survival fitness or disadvantage during interactions with a human macrophage cell line u <dig> and after exposure to factors that simulate the macrophage milieu. although our previous report described  <dig> different morphotypes from clinical isolates, the five isolates used here from  <dig> different clinical and  <dig> environmental samples were only observed to switch under nutritional limitation from parental type i to types ii and iii, allowing comparison of  <dig> isogenic morphotypes with known variable phenotype.

the initial interaction between the human macrophage cell line u <dig> and  <dig> isogenic morphotypes of b. pseudomallei was not different between the three types. despite a comparable rate of extracellular growth between isogenic morphotypes, heterogeneity in subsequent intracellular survival/growth after this time point was observed. type iii of each isolate was inconsistently capable of multiplication after uptake by human macrophages, and was associated with a change in morphotype. this suggests that type iii has a fitness disadvantage under these circumstances. a possible explanation for this is that type iii does not appear to produce biofilm  <cit> . a biofilm mutant demonstrated a mark reduction in intracellular survival in primary human macrophages than the wild type, suggesting that biofilm production is associated with the ability to survive in human macrophages  <cit> .

our previous study examined the survival and replication of b. pseudomallei strain  <dig> in the human respiratory epithelial cell line a <dig> and the mouse macrophage cell line j744a. <dig>  our finding here that type iii of strain  <dig> had increased survival in the human macrophage cell line u <dig> is consistent with our previous findings for the mouse macrophage cell line j774a. <dig> infected with the same strain  <cit> . however, the use of a wider number of strains in this study demonstrated that there was a lack of reproducibility between strains. we suggest that this is likely relate to variability in genomic content between the strains tested. future testing strategies require the evaluation of a large numbers of strains that have undergone whole genome sequencing to facilitate statistically robust comparisons between genomic variation and phenotypic behaviour.

several components of the innate immune system are efficient in killing organisms within human macrophages  <cit> . the most important of these are the antimicrobial peptides and nitric oxide , the superoxide anion , and hydrogen peroxide , all of which are directly toxic to bacteria. reactive oxygen species generated by the phagocyte nadph oxidase have an essential role in the control of b. pseudomallei infection in c57bl/ <dig> bone marrow derived macrophages  <cit> . type i of all  <dig> b. pseudomallei isolates tested here had the greatest resistance to h2o <dig>  followed by types ii and iii, respectively, suggesting that type i has the greatest potential to scavenge or degrade h2o <dig> molecules. this may explain the finding that type i had the highest replication after uptake by the macrophage cell line. type iii switched to type i or ii during culture in medium containing h2o <dig>  indicated that type iii had a survival disadvantage under such conditions that required switching to a more h2o <dig> resistant type.

one of the mechanisms by which b. pseudomallei escapes macrophage killing is by repressing inducible nitric oxide synthase  by activating the expression of two negative regulators, a suppressor of cytokine signaling  <dig> and cytokione-inducible src homology2-containing protein   <cit> . it is unknown whether there are variation between strains and isogenic morphotypes in the ability to interfere with inos induction. however, colony morphology differences did not influence resistance to rni. b. pseudomallei is protected from rni by the production of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase  protein and depends on oxyr regulator and a compensatory katg expression  <cit> . these mechanisms may not be associated with colony morphology variability.

b. pseudomallei survive in the phagolysosome  <cit>  which are acidified environments containing lysozymes, proteins and antimicrobial peptides that destroy pathogen. there was no difference in growth for the  <dig> isogenic morphotypes of b. pseudomallei derived from all five isolates at all ph levels tested above  <dig> , but a ph of  <dig>  was universally bactericidal, suggesting that morphotype switching did not provide a survival advantage against acid conditions.

all morphotypes of b. pseudomallei were highly resistance to lysozyme and lactoferrin. lysozyme functions to dissolve cell walls of bacteria. lactoferrin is a competitor that works by binding iron and preventing uptake by the bacteria. common structures for resistance to these factors such as capsule and lps  <cit>  were present in all isogenic morphotypes  <cit> . an alternative explanation is that b. pseudomallei may produce a morphotype-independent lysozyme inhibitor that counteracts the action of lysozyme and lactoferrin.

antimicrobial peptides are efficient at killing a broad range of organisms. they are distributed in variety tissues, and in neutrophils and macrophages  <cit> . all  <dig> isogenic b. pseudomallei morphotypes were resistant to α-defensin hnp- <dig> and β-defensin hbd- <dig>  but were susceptible to ll- <dig>  in contrast to sensitivity to h2o <dig>  type iii was more resistant than type i or ii to ll- <dig>  this ability may allow type iii to survive within host cells for a limited period before successfully switching to alternative phenotypes and may provide a fitness of advantage in macrophages.

another feature of bacterial survival during the establishment of persistent infection in the host is adaptation to hypoxia in the host microenvironment  <cit> . this study demonstrated that all  <dig> isogenic morphotypes were able to tolerate a low oxygen concentration and anaerobic conditions for at least two weeks. type iii switching to either type i or ii was observed during recovery from anaerobic incubation. the fact that types i and ii were stable following anaerobic incubation suggests that they are tolerant of fluctuations in oxygen concentration.

given the variation in the genome of different b. pseudomallei, it was not surprising to observe some variation in intracellular replication between isogenic morphotypes of different isolates. only one strain switched from type iii to ii, while the other four isolates switched from type iii to type i in all conditions in which a change in morphotype was observed. analyses of  <dig> isolates in this study provide evidence that colony morphology variation represents heterogeneous phenotypes of b. pseudomallei with different fitness advantages to interact, survive and replicate in the presence of bactericidal substances within human macrophages.

a limitation of this study is that the experimental methods were laborious and time consuming, which restricted the number of strains we could examine. it is also unclear whether these in vitro assays using a human macrophage cell line are a good model for human infection. further studies are required to determine the molecular mechanism of morphotype switching, and whether this is associated with persistence of b. pseudomallei in the human host.

CONCLUSIONS
b. pseudomallei can produce different colony morphologies in vivo and in vitro. this study has described the intracellular survival and replication of two isogenic morphotypes ii and iii generated from  <dig> different parental type i b. pseudomallei in the u <dig> human macrophage cell line, and has examined the survival of these isogenic morphotypes compared to the parental types in the presence of a variety of substances and under conditions which are potentially encountered within the macrophage milieu. data for  <dig> isolates demonstrated that there was variability in bacterial survival and replication following uptake by human macrophages between parental type i and types ii or iii, as well as variability between strains. uptake of type iii alone was associated with colony morphology switching. type i was associated with survival in the presence of h2o <dig>  in contrast, isogenic morphotype iii demonstrated higher resistance to antimicrobial peptide ll- <dig>  specific morphotypes were not associated with survival with susceptibility to acid, acidified sodium nitrite, or resistance to lysozyme, lactoferrin, hnp- <dig> or hbd- <dig>  incubation under anaerobic conditions was a strong driver for switching of type iii to an alternative morphotype in all isolates.
