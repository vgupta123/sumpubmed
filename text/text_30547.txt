BACKGROUND
the spinach plant belongs to the family chenopodiaceae, which is a diploid with 2n =  <dig> chromosomes. spinach has a long cultivation history in china, and was introduced in the  <dig> a.d. its strong resistance to cold renders it compatible with china’s short growing season. it can be multi-stubble cultivated in one year, making it an important edible green vegetable for three of the four seasons . spinach is also rich in minerals and vitamins . because of its rich nutrition and delicious taste, spinach is one of the most popular leafy vegetables. currently, there are more than  <dig> countries planting spinach, most of which are concentrated in the subtropical regions  <cit> . china is the largest grower and consumer of spinach. according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations   statistics in  <dig>  the top three producers of spinach were china, japan, and united states of america. china produced  <dig>  million tons, which was far more than the second leading country produced  <dig>  million tons. spinach breeding and related research has aroused the attention of chinese breeders.

spinach is a dioecious species with separate male and female plants and occasional monoecious plants with both male and female flowers  <cit> . due to its reproductive efficiency, easy cultivation, and small genome, spinach is particularly suitable for the study of the sex-determining gene  <cit> . for these reasons, researchers generally believe that spinach is an ideal dioecious plant model for investigating the mechanism of sex determination. in  <dig>  bemis and wilson et al. reported that sex in the species was regulated by a heteromorphic xy chromosome pair  <cit> . sex has been found to be genetically associated with the longest of the six spinach chromosomes containing the alleles x, x” and y, which affect sex determination  <cit> . a reciprocal translocation proved that the sex-determining genes are located on the short arm of chromosome  <cit> . in  <dig>  the y chromosome in spinach was isolated and analyzed by microdissection for the first time; the largest spinach chromosome was confirmed to be a sex chromosome at the molecular level  <cit> . some molecular markers linked to the x/y gene have been found and used for the study of molecular markers of spinach sex. akamatsu et al. found dnas that exist specifically in male spinach plants and then converted them to some sequence-characterized amplified regions  markers . in this way, the sex of spinach can be determined easily and rapidly before bolting using this method  <cit> . khattak et al. made the first genetic map of spinach, and the sex-determining gene was located on the linkage group  <dig> at a distance of  <dig>  cm from a ssr marker called so <dig>  <cit> . ten amplified fragment length polymorphism  markers and two male-specific dnas, t11a and v20a, were mapped to a  <dig>  cm region encompassing the x/y locus, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers  <cit> . though spinach is normally considered a dioecious species, monoecious plants are found in certain genotypes with various proportions of staminate and pistillate flowers  <cit> . the strictly monoecious character was considered to be conditioned by the known allele x
m . the genetic distance between the monoecious gene and so <dig> was  <dig>  cm, while the x/y gene was found to be  <dig>  cm with so <dig>  this showed that the monoecious gene was not the allele of the x/y gene, but is closely linked to it  <cit> . yamamoto et al. developed  <dig> aflp markers and narrowed down the location of the monoecious gene. these markers spanned  <dig>  cm and encompassed the monoecious gene. linkage analysis showed that the monoecious gene and y gene were located between different marker pairs. they were in different intervals  <cit> .

in many genetic and genomic researches high-density linkage maps were valuable tools, especially for the applications of qtl mapping, map-based cloning of trait-controlled genes, and the assembly of the genome. khattak et al. have reported a genetic linkage map using  <dig> aflp and nine simple sequence repeats   <cit> . the map was divided into seven linkage groups with a total length of  <dig> cm and the average genetic distance between the adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm. it is the first time to report the construction of a genetic linkage map for spinach. another genetic map was based on  <dig> single nucleotide polymorphism  markers identified in actively transcribed genes with a total size of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . the map was divided over six linkage groups that matched to the basic chromosome number in spinach, presenting a significant improvement over the published map by khattak et al. however, some linkage groups contained relatively large gaps,  <dig> cm in linkage group  <dig> and  <dig> cm in linkage group  <dig>  due to the limitations of the research foundation, such as the lack of rich and reliable molecular markers and the shortage of high-density linkage maps, many spinach researchers were restricted in gene mapping. with the development of sequencing technology and the reduction of its cost, many species have been sequenced and resequenced. deynze et al. have reported the reference genome illumina sequencing work of spinach. of those, 88% were completely assembled, and the spinach reference genome sequence was submitted to the national center for biotechnology information . this provided the basis for the follow-up study of the spinach genome.

a key section for constructing a high-density linkage map is the availability of abundant genetic markers. this is feasible due to the advances in next-generation sequencing  technology for large-scale markers discovery  <cit> . several large population genotyping platforms have emerged with the practical application of ngs. slaf-seq is based on reduced representation library  and high-throughput sequencing which provides an economical and efficient approach to large-scale genotyping. it can provide a large number of indel and snp markers at the same time and construct a high-density genetic map very quickly. besides, there are considerably more markers in the genetic maps produced by slaf-seq was than in conventional maps. this provides access for researchers to select the most information and reliable polymorphic markers needed to achieve the superior ability of functional gene mapping of important agronomic traits. slaf-seq technology has several distinguishing characteristics that have let to its widespread use in studies in the past  <dig> years  <cit> . up until now, this technology has been successfully applied to the construction of the genetic map in various species. li et al. constructed a high-density genetic map for soybeans, and  <dig> qtls were identified that contributed to the isoflavone content by this map  <cit> ; zhang et al. developed the first high-density genetic map in sesame  <cit> ; a high-density pumpkin genetic map was constructed and identified qtls were highly associated with pumpkin vine length  <cit> , in agropyron gaertn, for wax gourds, for mei  and so on  <cit> . more and more genetic maps are being constructed using slaf-seq technology.

in this study, a high-density genetic map of spinach has been constructed based on slaf-seq was reported. it is the highest density genetic map of spinach reported at present. at the same time, the sex-determining region was mapped to a single lg by the combination of bsa method and slaf technology. this map offered a valuable tool for the study of genome assembly, qtl mapping and map-based gene cloning in spinach, and will also provide a reference for sex determination mechanism studies in other dioecious species.

RESULTS
analysis of slaf-seq data and slaf markers
finally, a total of  <dig>  million paired-end read data was obtained from the high-throughput sequencing. the q <dig> percentage was  <dig> %, and guanine-cytosine  content was  <dig> % on average. all slaf paired-end reads with clear index information were clustered based on sequence similarity, and sequences with over 95% identity were grouped in one slaf locus. summary of the slaf markers after filtering out the low, repeat, and ambiguous tags was expressed in detail in table  <dig>  as shown, the slaf’s number of maternal and paternal parents was  <dig>  and  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold coverage, respectively, while the slaf number of offspring was  <dig> , with an average depth of  <dig> -fold coverage. through the statistical analysis of slaf tag data of parents and offspring,  <dig>  different high-quality slafs were developed altogether, and only  <dig>  of the slaf’s tags were effective polymorphic slafs, with a polymorphism percentage of  <dig> % . in order to facilitate subsequent genetic analysis, molecular markers were needed to carry out genotype encoding with genetics’ two allelic general encoding rules as shown in table  <dig>  finally,  <dig>  of the polymorphic slaf tags were successfully encoded. genotype distribution of slaf markers are shown in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  slafs fell into the aa × bb segregation pattern which were used for genetic map construction, the effective polymorphism of the genetic map was  <dig> %. to ensure the quality of the genetic map, slaf tags were filtered with some rules, which are shown in the method details. finally,  <dig>  slafs were obtained and used for the construction of the linkage map.table  <dig> summary of the developed specific length amplified fragment  markers

high-density genetic linkage map construction for spinach
a high-density genetic map of spinach based on slaf-seq technology was ultimately constructed. after linkage analysis,  <dig>  slaf markers were mapped onto the genetic map, making the mapping ratio of the available slaf tags about  <dig> %. with different linkage groups, the distribution of slaf numbers ranged from  <dig> in lg <dig> to  <dig> in lg <dig> . the map spanned  <dig> , <dig> cm with an average genetic distance of  <dig>  cm between the adjacent marker loci . it was divided into  <dig> linkage groups corresponding to the number of spinach chromosome. the length of the linkage groups in the genetic map ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm , with an average of  <dig>  cm. lg <dig> and lg <dig> was the highest density group, containing  <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively, both with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm. the shortest linkage group was lg <dig> that contained  <dig> markers with an average genetic distance of  <dig>  cm. the longest linkage group was lg <dig>  which contained  <dig> markers with an average genetic distance of  <dig>  cm. the largest gap, which indicated the degree of uniformity, was located on lg1and lg <dig> with a marker interval of  <dig>  cm. to our knowledge it is the highest density genetic map of spinach reported at present.table  <dig> description of basic characteristics for the six linkage groups

the integrated genetic of spinach contained  <dig> types of molecular markers: ‘snp-only’-type, ‘indel-only’-type, and ‘snp&indel’ markers, of which ‘snp-only’ was the main type. there were a total of  <dig>  snp markers in the genetic map. table  <dig> shows the number distribution of snp markers. snp mining and typing is an important step in gene mapping. snps are the more appropriate choice for genetic analysis based on sequencing at present; it has many advantages, such as large number, wide distribution, easy genotyping, and suitability for rapid and large-scale screening. these snp markers might provide important information for the location of functional genes.

mapping of the sex-determining gene x/y
to illustrate the sex determination of spinach, we used super-bsa to identify candidate genes associated with sex in spinach. combined with the high-density genetic map of spinach,  <dig> associated slaf markers were identified, and these markers were concentrated in two hot spots, which contained  <dig> genes on lg <dig> that may be related to the sex differentiation of spinach  . position results showed that the sex determination region  were fine mapping to the corresponding chromosome, which will provide important information for further studies of spinach .fig.  <dig> analysis of the sex phenotype on linkage groups 





discussion
high-density genetic map application
there were only a few studies on the genetic map of spinach, and, until now, only two genetic linkage maps were published. one study was constructed in a classical backcross population with  <dig> markers of ssr and aflps  <cit> . the markers number of this genetic map was not big enough, and the genetic map was divided into seven linkage groups,since spinach has only six chromosomes, two of the present linkage groups should probably be joined. the other genetic map was based on  <dig> snp markers identified in actively transcribed genes with a total size of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . the map was divided over six linkage groups, have more number and more convenient marker over the published map by khattak et al. however, the markers in linkage group  <dig> and in linkage group  <dig> were limited and not evenly distributed. in this study, a high-density genetic map of spinach based on slaf-seq technique was constructed. here,  <dig> slaf markers were located on the genetic map. the map spanned  <dig> . <dig> cm and was divided into six linkage groups corresponding to the number of spinach chromosomes, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between the adjacent marker loci. compared with the two previously reported genetic maps, this map has more numbers for accurate gene mapping. finally, the traditional method of constructing a genetic map was very time consuming and laborious; restrictions in throughput are a limiting factor of large-scale genotyping in the construction of a high-density genetic map.

ngs has revolutionized genomics, which allows efficient development of a large number of polymorphic markers in a short time and enables high-density genetic map construction to be more efficient than ever before. with the increase of the sequencing level and the reduction of the cost of sequencing, more and more high-density genetic maps were constructed. these were exceptionally valuable tools for qtl mapping, fine-scale mapping, and map-based cloning of trait-controlled genes. with a high-density genetic map of glycine max, the consistent qtls for isoflavone content across various environments were identified  <cit> . liu et al. used  <dig> ssr primer pairs to construct a map, followed by the identification of yield and seed trait qtl in upland cotton  <cit> . a locus-controlling weeping trait in mei was identified by the application of the high-density of genetic map  <cit> . one qtl for walnut anthracnose resistance was identified based on the high-density genetic map of walnuts  <cit> . a high-density genetic map of pumpkins was constructed for anchoring genome sequences and identifying qtls associated with the dwarf vine  <cit> . these successful localizations of important agricultural traits strongly indicate that the high-density map is a worthy reference in many genetic and genomic applications.

the advantage of slaf and super-bsa
the slaf represents a revolution in the simplified genome sequencing technology by its special characters, such as its effective read length, high throughput, flexible program design, and so on. it finds the best balance between the cost of sequencing and the depth of the sequencing. slaf can obtain the whole genome-wide variation image  and provide access for researchers to choose the most informative and reliable polymorphic markers in order to achieve the functional gene mapping of important agronomic traits of excellence. bsa was commonly used to locate two extreme-trait-related genes or regions. it is a classical method for rapidly and effectively identifying markers target genes, and it is widely used in crop breeding studies. super-bsa combined the slaf-seq with bsa to identify candidate regions associated with target traits. super-bsa has the following advantages over traditional bsa:i. large-scale mixed pool - the number of individuals in the mixed pool could reach or exceed  <dig>  which is larger than the traditional bsa.

ii. higher marker density : the number of sequenced tags that were used for dna pools scanning can reach  <dig> .

iii. quantitative statistical genotype frequency - the use of second-generation sequencing technology provided direct access to the digitized signal.

iv. finer positioning: the snps obtained from slaf-seq is evenly distributed in the genome and repetitive regions were avoided to the greatest extent possible, so the positioning effect was better than a traditional gel-based marker.

v. cost-effectiveness - uses the same cost with traditional marker screening and there is no need to invest excessive amounts of manpower and time.




in this study, we used sequencing data instead of dna samples to produce the extreme trait pool based on the spinach sex phenotype. each association marker was supported by the individual plant data, which would facilitate follow-up studies. super-bsa may greatly speed up the progress of target trait mapping and molecular marker-assisted selection breeding in the future.

the follow-up study of the sex-determining gene mapping in spinach
spinach sex is controlled by the sex-determining gene x/y. akamatsu et al. developed two scar markers, t11a and v20a, which lined with the x/y gens  <cit> . in the first genetic map of spinach made by khattak et al., the x/y gene was mapped on lg <dig> with a distance of  <dig>  cm to so <dig>  <cit> . ten aflp markers developed by bsa method were closely linked to the y, in which four markers were co-segregate with y. combined with t11a and v20a, the markers were mapped to a  <dig>  cm region encompassing the y locus, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers  <cit> . yamamoto et al. developed  <dig> aflp markers closely linked to the monoecious gene, and suggested that the monoecious gene and y were located in different intervals, t11a and v20a were co-segregated with y and so <dig> was lined with the monoecious gene. t11a and v20a markers were used in all these studies. in the current study, the super-bsa method was used to identify regions associated with the sex-determining gene of spinach. ultimately, two hot regions with  <dig> markers linked to the sex-determining gene were obtained, the sex-determining gene x/y was located at the position of lg <dig> , which were supposed to be the sex determining regions. the markers t11a and v20a have been used to detect the mapping population. results showed that the two markers were also located in the mapping region and co-segregated with x/y gene. so our x/y gene mapping region was consistent with previous research results and showed a finer accurate positioning.

using the genetic map to assist the spinach reference genome assembly, the scaffold was anchored to the corresponding sex linkage markers. through bioinformatics analysis, there were  <dig> genes in the two hot regions associated with sex determination. the function of these genes will be studied further to elucidate the mechanism associated with the sex-determining gene in spinach, and the associated snps will be used for mas of spinach. the plan for the next work is to expand the segregation population and develop new ssr, indel, and snp markers for fine mapping of the sex-determining genes. this is the first time any study, domestic or international, has used spinach reference genome information combined with the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology to study the molecular mechanism and cloning of the sex-determining gene of spinach. this work also provides reference data for the further study of other characters of spinach.

CONCLUSIONS
a high-density genetic map of spinach based on the slaf-seq technique was constructed, and is currently the highest density genetic map of spinach reported. in addition, the high-density genetic map of spinach was combined with super-bsa to identify candidate genes associated with sex in spinach. finally,  <dig> associated slaf markers were identified, and two main hot regions that were detected on lg <dig> may relate to the sex differentiation of spinach ; these contained  <dig> genes in the two regions. the use of this map will lay the foundation for the study of the molecular biology of spinach, and may be applied toward additional research endeavors . it will also provide a reference for studies in other dioecious plants and assist in studying the mechanism of sex determination.
