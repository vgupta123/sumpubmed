BACKGROUND
in the classical view , evoked potentials reflect a sequential 'bottom-up' processing of sensory stimulus inducing specific sequence of monophasic 'evoked' potential peaks that are embedded in 'random background' electroencephalogram . they are considered as distinctive components with fixed latency and polarity, reflecting anatomically distinct generators whose activity is independent from the spontaneous eeg, which is considered as noise that must be ruled out by means of averaging  <cit> . in this conceptual view, the eeg phase distribution is unaffected by the stimulation and the amplitude reduction of an evoked potential component is interpreted independently of temporal reorganization of the ongoing eeg.

an alternative view  suggested by pioneer experiments  <cit>  pointed out the fact that evoked potentials might result from phase-locking or phase-reset of the basic eeg rhythms within specific frequency bands, as a response to external stimulation  <cit> . evidence of stimulus-induced phase-locking has been reported by several groups, using a variety of signal analysis methods  <cit> .

in this context, the concept of synchronized resonances has been introduced by basar in  <dig>  <cit> . in accordance to the general theory of resonance phenomena it was proposed that a sensory stimulation gives rise to 'evoked' or 'induced' eeg rhythms in several frequency bands. the 'evoked' rhythms are phase-locked to the stimulus and can be observed in the averaged evoked potentials, while the 'induced' rhythms are cancelled out during averaging because of the jitter in the latency from one trial to the next  <cit> . contribution of the oscillatory model has been demonstrated in the generation of visual and auditory evoked potentials  <cit> .

here we tested whether this model can apply in somatosensory evoked potentials . we focused on the frontal n <dig> component of sep, as it is highly sensitive to interference or gating from concomitant involvement of the brain in sensory, motor and mental activities  <cit> . this wave is specifically modulated by electrical stimulation of the internal part of the globus pallidus or the subthalamus nuclei of parkinsonian patients  <cit> , suggesting that it may represent a reliable physiological index of the dopaminergic motor pathways  <cit> . investigation of the frontal n <dig> component has increasingly been used in a host of clinical conditions  <cit> . however, the physiological interpretation and the origin of the frontal n <dig> are still debated  <cit> .

the aim of this work was to study whether reorganization of background eeg activity contributes to the generation of the n <dig> component or whether this component essentially results from the activity of a generator unrelated to ongoing eeg rhythms, as posited in the additive model. confirmation of the latter hypothesis would imply that future research should continue to concentrate on the characterization of discrete local generators through improved cancelling out of ongoing eeg rhythms. in this view, inversion of the polarity of the n <dig> component, as illustrated in patients with early acquired basal ganglia lesions  <cit>  might be interpreted as reflecting a sign switch in cortical synaptic currents. in contrast, if oscillatory phase-resetting contributes to the n <dig>  future analyses should specifically address the relationship between stimulation and the dynamic organization of background eeg, including phase-synchronization of ongoing rhythms across various spatiotemporal scales. in the above example, n <dig> polarity inversion would reflect abnormal phase resetting of ongoing eeg rhythms rather than synaptic changes. this might also provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the facilitation of information transfer and in particular perceptual binding  <cit> .

making progress in the debate between the additive and the oscillatory models  <cit>  has become crucial because evoked potentials are increasingly used in clinic as physiological and neuropsychological index of brain areas or as link with other functional approaches such as fmri and the underlying network dynamics. it must be borne in mind, however, that the two models are not mutually exclusive. for example, phase-locked components  may be present in both the additive and oscillatory models. nevertheless, it was shown that phase-locking and power enhancement of theta, alpha and gamma rhythms may evolve independently in aging and development  <cit> , indicating the existence of different physiological mechanisms.

the approach of time-frequency analysis to single eeg trials we used was developed by makeig et al.   <cit> . this method allows to identify a superimposed neural contribution in the latency range of the evoked response by computing changes in the power spectrum in comparison with the pre-event activity. moreover, it allows to detect phase reorganization of eeg rhythms. however, a limitation of this approach was underlined in a recent simulation study demonstrating that the addition of a phasic signal on the ongoing eeg was able to induce a phase resetting in some eeg frequency bands  <cit> . indeed, there are two variants of the oscillation hypothesis. the first and simple situation is the pure phase resetting during which the occurrence of an event leads to resetting the phase of ongoing eeg rhythms without any change in the amplitude modulation of the eeg. this unequivocal situation has been described for the n <dig> component of the auditory  <cit>  and visual evoked potentials  <cit> . the second, more complex situation is described as phase resetting with enhancement during which the sensory stimulation induces an increase in eeg amplitude in addition to phase resetting  <cit> . in this case, it is not possible to distinguish the activity generated by phasic neural events  from those linked to eeg phase resetting  <cit> . this is the reason why we investigated whether phase-locking and event-related power spectral perturbation in specific eeg frequency bands occur in the production of this component. we focused our analysis on the presence or absence in the different trials of a pure phase-resetting participating in the production of the n <dig> sep component, as pure phase-resetting  would demonstrate the contribution of the oscillatory model to n <dig> generation.

RESULTS
grand averaged analysis
for alpha rhythm , a diffuse band of itc value reaching the maximum  at the latency of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms was present but no significant ersp value  was found at this frequency .

for faster gamma rhythm, a cluster with a diffuse shape was obtained . the maximal gamma itc corresponded to a frequency peak of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz occurring at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms. the grand average ersp map showed two distinct clusters around  <dig> hz and  <dig> hz, respectively . however, in contrast to the  <dig> hz ersp cluster, these higher frequency rhythms were differently expressed by the subjects and mainly provided by two of them.

identification of pure phase-locking
identification of phase resetting of spontaneous eeg activities in certain frequency bands requires the demonstration of the presence of these eeg oscillations in the absence of stimulus. we therefore measured the power spectrum of the spontaneous  <dig> hz oscillation in each single trial excluding the periods of evoked activity. for all the recorded trials, the mean of the  <dig> hz power spectrum represented a value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  db. this suggests that the  <dig> hz oscillation, may be involved in a phase-locking process. for indication, the  <dig> hz power spectrum represented ~65% of the power spectrum of the dominant alpha-mu rhythm  measured during the same period .

as it was demonstrated that in case of phase locking with enhancement, which corresponds to the present situation, it was impossible to distinguish the possible contribution of eeg phase-resetting from phasic activity  <cit> , we focused our analysis on the trials of individual subjects in which the power spectrum in the beta/gamma band respected the criterion described in equation n° <dig> and thus remained unchanged after stimulation.

for each of the  <dig> subjects, it was possible to identify a large percentage of trials  for which the power spectrum remained unchanged within the whole frequency range spanning  <dig> to  <dig> hz. figure  <dig> illustrates the result of this selection in one subject. when all the trials were taken into account a clear ersp cluster appeared in the beta/gamma band  and fig. 3a ). this power increase was concomitantly accompanied by a significant itc cluster  and fig. 3b ). after the selection, although no more ersp cluster could be found , a significant itc cluster in the beta/gamma band was still present . the maximal itc value, duration, peak latency and frequency band of the itc cluster were not significantly changed by the trial selection . conversely, the n <dig> amplitude was significantly reduced by the selection . in spite of this amplitude reduction, the n <dig> component conserved its initial morphology and peaked at the same latency . after the selection procedure the relative percentage of the  <dig> hz power remained the same .

these itc parameters were collected from eeglab template. one-way anova test shows that for each of the four presented parameters, the values measured for all the trials versus those measured for the trials with no ersp change were not significantly different.

although we selected trials for which power variation was statistically comparable to power distribution in the stimulus-free period, we compared the results obtained for the trials for which beta/gamma oscillation power was between rmsfree and rmsfree-1sd  and the one for which beta/gamma power was between rmsfree and rmsfree+1sd . no significant differences between the two groups of trials in the itc value  and n <dig> amplitude  were found. this indicates that both significant phase-locking and n <dig> component were already present if only the trials presenting a power decrease were taken into account.

phase-locking analysis
in order to demonstrate the temporal reorganization of beta/gamma oscillations following the stimulation, the instantaneous phase of each selected trial was calculated for each subject. figure  <dig> shows the spontaneous phases of all selected trials of all the subjects  in a cumulative histogram. before the stimulus, the histogram of phase distribution corresponds to uniform density function . after the stimulus a phase alignment occurred and the phase distribution became gradually more peaked.

the peak of the distribution reached a phase value of  <dig> radian at the latency of the n <dig> component . the comparison between the mean histogram calculated for the - <dig> ms pre-stimulus time  and the  <dig> ms post-stimulus time  showed a clear distinction between uniform and peaked distribution at  <dig> radian. the conservation of a same range of standard deviation throughout the distribution provided evidence for the reliability of the effect across subjects. figure  <dig> illustrates the z score of the kuiper's statistic κ. the difference in phase distribution between the pre-stimulus reference period  and the post-stimulus times was significant  below a z score value of  <dig> . this level was reached for each analyzed time after the stimulus and became highly significant around the n <dig> latency, reaching a value of - <dig>  ±  <dig> .

discussion
we found that the frontal n <dig> component of the sep was characterized by a significant increase of the power spectrum of beta/gamma rhythm peaking around  <dig> hz. this event-related spectral perturbation was accompanied by significant phase-locking of beta/gamma oscillation peaking at the latency of the frontal n <dig> component. in terms of the oscillation model of evoked potentials this situation corresponds to phase resetting with enhancement. in this situation, it is difficult to distinguish between the contribution of phasic neuronal activation versus phase resetting of ongoing eeg oscillation  <cit> . however, we demonstrated that for each subject a significant percentage of eeg trials show a beta/gamma phase-locking in the absence of any increase of the eeg power at the latency of the n <dig> component. this pure phase resetting indicates that some of the frequency content of the ongoing eeg  was phase-reset by the sensory stimulation and contributed to the frontal n <dig> amplitude.

we have focused the present paper on this beta/gamma oscillation because the itc and ersp values were maximal for this frequency band and that they coincide with the n <dig> latency peak. however, the absence of alpha power enhancement in the present data does not exclude the influence of its partial phase-locking on the evoked potentials amplitude.

it is generally admitted that phase-resetting implies  <dig> main requirements  <cit> :  oscillation at the dominant frequency of the evoked response must be present in the pre-stimulus period;  the transition between the pre- to the post-stimulus periods must involve phase concentration;  this phase transition must occur without concomitant increase in power at the dominant frequency of the erp  <cit> . the present findings respected these  <dig> criteria. with respect to the first criterion, power spectrum analysis in the pre-stimulus period revealed that spontaneous beta/gamma oscillations are present and that they might thus be involved in phase-locking process. this criterion is reminiscent of the oscillatory susceptibility rule of basar  <cit> .

in the same line of evidence, this necessary condition for a plausible physiological contribution of beta/gamma oscillation phase-locking to the n <dig> component is reinforced by previous demonstration of spontaneous cortical activities in this frequency band in the sensori-motor areas. in humans, beta rhythm has been recorded by intra cerebral recordings in the pre- and post-central gyrus and in the frontal medial cortex  <cit> . in monkeys, field-potential oscillations in the 20– <dig> hz range have been reported  <cit>  and were supported by synchronous oscillatory activity in a large number of cortical neurons  <cit>  providing synchronisation of neuronal firing between somatosensory and motor areas  <cit> .

as time frequency measures have revealed the existence of phase reset with power enhancement of beta/gamma oscillation, we singled out the trials for which such enhancement did not occur in order to analyze our findings in the framework of the second criteria. these selected trials represented about 62% of the original trials. in this way, we also complied with the third criteria of a strict absence of power enhancement in these selected trials. we demonstrated that the stimulus induced a temporal reorganization of the spontaneous phase of the ongoing beta/gamma oscillation in these trials. the absence of a concomitant power increase in these trials rules out the possibility that an evoked de novo beta/gamma rhythm might explain the phase transition of the ongoing beta/gamma oscillation. the presence of significant itc value and n <dig> amplitude when only the trials for which the power of beta/gamma oscillation decreases after the stimulation reinforces the contribution of ongoing eeg phase modulation in the n <dig> generation. however, it is important to emphasize that the presence of this pure phase locking does not exclude that evoked phasic activity occurs when all the trials were taken into account. indeed, when the trials presenting power enhancement were rejected, we found that the n <dig> amplitude was significantly decreased. as itc values remained the same, this amplitude reduction indicates the contribution of phasic activation to the n <dig> amplitude. this result was in line with theoretical  <cit>  and experimental  <cit>  studies demonstrating that phase and amplitude modulation could participate together in evoked potentials generation.

it was previously shown that median nerve stimulation was able to trigger an increase in the power of the  <dig> and  <dig> hz oscillations  <cit> , but only after a delay of  <dig> ms, which is  <dig> times later than the occurrence of the present  <dig> hz oscillation. the same type of stimulation evoked an increase in the power of beta/gamma oscillation peaking around  <dig> ms with a latency onset of  <dig> ms  <cit> . these authors showed a decrease in beta oscillation during hand manipulation whereas the amplitude of p140/n <dig> sep components was increased. however, the behaviour of early sep components was not the focus of these studies.

event-related synchronisation of gamma rhythms  to hand movement onset and offset  <cit>  may correspond to the present clusters of gamma itc recorded during median nerve stimulation. indeed, the present paradigm produced small twitches of the thumb, inducing an afferent sensory feedback. however, the peak latency of the gamma phase-locking occurred too early  to originate from thumb movement feedback.

resonance in the basal ganglionic-thalamo-cortical loop could be implicated in gamma oscillation triggered by sensory stimulation. the pallidum and the subthalamic nucleus form a functional network that resonates at  <dig> hz in the presence of a normal dopaminergic drive  <cit> . this rhythm is replaced by slower oscillations in the off-state of parkinsonian patients  <cit> , which could be related to the n <dig> alteration in the parkinsonian off-state  <cit> . recently, it was suggested that the  <dig> hz oscillation in the subthalamic nucleus that is suppressed during finger actual movement or mental imagery in parkinsonian patients could be physiological and present in normal subjects  <cit> .

the presence of a pure phase resetting in a large percentage of the sep trials is the key element of the present study. it resembles the situation of the n <dig> components evoked by visual  <cit>  or auditory stimuli  <cit> . the transition of the spontaneous phase from a pre-stimulus uniform distribution to a peaked form at  <dig> radian at the time of the n <dig> component demonstrates the reorganization of the ongoing beta/gamma rhythm. as proposed in the case of many erp components  <cit>  in addition to this phase resetting effect, the rest of the evoked component may be generated by coherent phasic activation of pyramidal neurons via thalamo-cortical input, as predicted by the classical view.

the present result could be integrated in the concept of synchronized resonances  <cit> . as described for the auditory  <dig> hz oscillation  <cit> , the n <dig> related beta/gamma rhythm may be viewed as a more global mechanism working in parallel to the stimuli processing of the somatosensory pathway. the phase-locking of this rhythm allows the placement of the sensory signal in the temporal context taking into account the intrinsic functional state of the brain at the arrival time of the stimulus.

the fact that we found power increase in some trials and not in others corroborates an integrative view that the classical and the oscillation models are not necessarily in opposition, but that their respective contribution must be clarified before tempting physiological or clinical conclusions.

as the activity recorded at one scalp channel sums activity from several cortical source areas  <cit> , the question of the origin of the phase-locked and non-phase-locked activities cannot be fully addressed without using multiple channels recording.

phase resetting of both local field potential and single-unit activity representative of the ongoing motor cortical beta  rhythms has been demonstrated in pyramidal tract stimulation in monkeys  <cit> . this view is also supported by in vitro and in vivo physiological studies  <cit>  showing enhanced oscillation when neurons fire in-phase with the oscillation field. this could explain at a cellular level how the depolarisation induced by the sensory stimulus is able to reset the oscillating phase and bring the system into a synchronous attractor basin at the latency of the n <dig> component.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that the frontal n <dig> component of the sep is characterized by an increase of the power spectrum of beta/gamma rhythm peaking at  <dig> hz and by a concomitant increase of the phase-locking. the fact that we found a pure phase-locking  in about two thirds of the trials accompanied by a reorganization of the spontaneous phase of the ongoing beta/gamma rhythm constitute evidence for the contribution of the oscillation model to the production of the frontal n <dig> component. the concomitant increase of the beta/gamma power in about one third of the trials indicating the contribution of phasic signal  implies interaction between the physiological mechanisms of stimulus phasic related component and phase-resetting of ongoing spontaneous oscillations.
