BACKGROUND
it is now well known that diversity at the protein level can result from different positions of transcriptional start and termination of a single gene, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications. however, there is now evidence that an additional level of diversity may also exist by the production of mrnas that combine sequence information from different genes, also known as intergenic mrnas. various mechanisms appear to be involved in this process and can be classified in two categories  trans-splicing events between pre-mrnas of distinct genes and  long transcription events across neighboring genes that normally act as independent transcription units. the latter case has been described for a number of genes including hai- <dig> and h2rsp  <cit> , the cyp2c locus  <cit> , galt and il-11rα  <cit> , p2y <dig> and ssf <dig>  <cit> , uev <dig> and kua  <cit> , 4e-bp <dig> and mask  <cit> . in all these cases, chimeric mrnas that are produced might encode proteins harboring functional domains that are usually not encountered on a single protein. however, although the chimeric transcripts appear to be present at a comparable level as single gene transcripts, the in vivo existence of chimeric proteins has not been confirmed so far, suggesting that the translation of chimeric transcripts might be subjected to a narrow regulation.

we describe here the existence of bovine chimeric transcripts involving the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma  gene and the neighboring gene, recently identified in human as the tsen <dig> gene   <cit> . these two genes are situated  <dig> kb from each other on human chromosome 3p <dig> and their respective position is conserved on bovine chromosome 22q <dig> . the pparg gene has been intensively studied because it encodes two nuclear receptors  implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle control, carcinogenesis, inflammation, atherosclerosis and mostly adipogenesis  <cit> . the reason why we decided to study this gene in cattle is because of its presumed implication in the amount of adipose tissue associated to the meat. the tsen <dig> gene encodes a protein involved in the formation of a human endonuclease complex whose function is the removal of introns from pre-trnas,. the complex is a heterotretramer formed by four distinct proteins that are well characterized in yeast  <cit>  but only very recently identified in human  <cit> . we identified two types of chimeric transcripts containing all but the last exon of the pparg gene followed by all the coding exons of the tsen <dig> gene . one chimeric transcript harbors a continuous open reading frame resulting from a perfect connection of the two coding regions, but lacks the region encoded by the last exon of pparg. the other chimeric transcript has an additional exon between the two regions, resulting from the transcription of a repetitive sequence situated in the 5' region of the tsen <dig> gene and introducing a stop codon in the coding sequence.

we show here that, in cattle, both genes can be expressed as independent transcriptional units or as a hybrid pparg-tsen <dig> transcript devoid of the last exon of pparg and the first exon of tsen <dig>  this chimeric transcript harbors an open reading frame encoding a putative chimeric protein combining domains from the two distinct proteins but we could not show any evidence of the existence of this protein. chimeric transcripts between these two genes cannot be detected in human or mouse.

RESULTS
the pparg and tsen <dig> genes form chimeric transcripts in cattle
when searching in the bovine est database for ests corresponding to the pparg gene, we found one est sequence  containing the end of pparg exon  <dig> followed by a sequence completely unrelated to the pparg gene. a blast search with this sequence revealed a high level of identity with two regions on the human genome :  the  <dig> bp situated downstream the pparg exon  <dig> on the est show 76% identity with a short sequence situated  <dig> kb downstream the pparg gene on human chromosome  <dig> and  the next  <dig> bp show 72% identity with the second exon of the tsen <dig> gene, situated  <dig> bp further down on the same chromosomal region . the exon junctions are perfectly conserved for pparg exon  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig> and the  <dig> bp region between the two exons on the est sequence appears to correspond on the human genome to a line l <dig> interspersed repeat.

the tsen <dig> gene  was recently identified in human  <cit> . it includes  <dig> exons spanning approximately  <dig> kb on human chromosome 3p <dig> and encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein. the start codon is situated in exon  <dig>  this gene was not characterized in cattle. we performed a blast search against the bovine est database using the human mrna sequence as target and identified several bovine ests corresponding to parts of the tsen <dig> gene . primers were designed from these est sequences and rt-pcr experiments were performed in order to confirm the existence of this transcript and get the full cdna sequence. a  <dig> bp cdna sequence  was amplified using total rna from various bovine tissues including liver, brain, skeletal muscles, spleen and heart, suggesting the ubiquitous expression of the gene. the bovine tsen <dig> cdna shows 77% sequence identity with the human cdna from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig>  which correspond to the coding sequence. it encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein displaying 72% sequence identity with the human protein. the untranslated exon  <dig> is not conserved between human and cattle .

in order to confirm the observation of the chimeric est, we performed rt-pcr experiments on bovine cdna using primers designed on pparg exon  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig>  rt-pcr was first performed on cdna from bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue . two different pcr products were obtained and sequenced. both fragments contained pparg exon  <dig> followed by tsen <dig> exon  <dig> and differed in the presence/absence of the  <dig> bp observed on the est bf <dig> and identified as a line l <dig> repeat. we then used primers from different regions of both genes in order to establish if these chimeric transcripts contain the whole coding sequence of pparg and tsen <dig> genes. we amplified two types of chimeric transcripts both containing pparg exon  <dig> to  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig> to  <dig>  and differing by the presence or absence of the line l <dig> repeat between pparg exon  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig>  . both types of transcripts use canonical splice sites for all exons coming from both genes.

the chimeric transcripts might be specifically expressed from the pparg <dig> promoter
two different transcripts differing in their 5' end are expressed from the pparg gene: pparg <dig>  and pparg <dig> . these two transcripts result from the existence of two promoters  <cit>  . we used forward primers specific of the pparg <dig> or pparg <dig> transcripts together with a reverse primer in the exon  <dig> of the tsen <dig> gene to test if the chimeric transcripts are expressed from both promoters. we did amplify transcripts spanning from pparg exon a <dig> to tsen <dig> exon  <dig> but we failed to amplify any rt-pcr product spanning from pparg exon b to tsen <dig> exon  <dig>  the experiment was repeated several times with different primer sets, using primers that allowed the amplification of the individual gene transcripts, and the results were always the same.

chimeric transcripts encode a putative truncated pparg protein and a putative chimeric pparg-tsen <dig> protein
both types of chimeric transcripts have an open reading frame using the start codon from pparg exon  <dig> and lack the stop codon of the pparg gene situated in exon  <dig>  the only exon missing in the chimeric transcripts. in the short chimeric transcript, the open reading frame is not interrupted between pparg exon  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig> and continues to the stop codon in tsen <dig> exon  <dig> . the first  <dig> nucleotides of tsen <dig> exon  <dig> are not included in the normal coding region of the gene, but they are perfectly inserted in frame with the coding sequence of the pparg gene. pparg exon  <dig> is normally interrupted by a phase i intron  but the connection with tsen <dig> exon  <dig> restores the codon and creates a short region encoding  <dig> amino acids in frame with the coding region of the tsen <dig> gene. consequently, the short chimeric transcript encodes a putative chimeric protein of  <dig> amino acids containing most of the pparγ <dig> protein and all the sen <dig> protein, plus nine additional amino-acids separating them.

in the long chimeric transcript, the presence of the line l <dig> repeat between pparg exon  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig> creates a premature termination codon , leading to a putative truncated pparγ protein lacking the last  <dig> amino acids that are encoded by exon  <dig>  but harboring instead  <dig> amino acids resulting from the translation of the first  <dig> nucleotides of the line l <dig>  however, because of the presence of a premature termination codon, this transcript may be subjected to degradation by rna surveillance mechanisms such as mrna decay  before being translated.

the organisation of the pparg-tsen <dig> genomic region is conserved between human chromosome 3p <dig> and bovine chromosome 22q24
we then decided to characterize and partially sequence the corresponding bovine genomic region in order  to establish if the relative position of the two genes is the same in cattle and human,  to determine if the line l <dig> repeat that is inserted in the long chimeric transcript is conserved and why that this short sequence is occasionally transcribed and  to localize the 5'untranslated exon  <dig> of the bovine tsen <dig> gene. we used a combination of approaches to obtain the genomic sequence of this region. we screened a bovine bac library with four sets of primers amplifying pparg exon  <dig>  pparg exon  <dig>  tsen <dig> exon  <dig> and tsen <dig> exon  <dig>  respectively. several bac clones were identified among which one clone  was positive for the four primer sets and one clone  positive with the three last primer pairs. the fact that the 3'end of the pparg gene and the 5'end of the tsen <dig> gene are present in the same bac clones confirm that they are close to each other in the bovine genome as in the human genome. we subcloned and sequence several regions from the bac clones and supplemented them using trace sequences from the bovine genome sequencing project . we obtained a  <dig> bp sequence containing the line l <dig> sequence present in the chimeric transcripts, exon  <dig> and part of intron  <dig> of the tsen <dig> gene , and a  <dig> bp sequence containing the end of intron  <dig>  exon  <dig> and beginning of intron  <dig> of the tsen <dig> gene .

we aligned the human and bovine sequences for the 5' region of the tsen <dig> gene. the line l <dig> repeat is conserved in sequence and position between human and cattle but there are canonical splice sites at both ends in cattle only, which might explain the fact that this sequence is present in bovine transcripts . the bovine untranslated exon  <dig> present in the est ck <dig> and in our cdna sequence is situated  <dig>  kb downstream of the line l <dig> repeat. in human, there are two different exons  <dig> . exon  <dig> is encountered in two human ests and is similar to the bovine exon  <dig>  exon 1bis is present in the reference mrna sequence for the human tsen <dig> gene  and is situated  <dig> bp downstream of exon  <dig>  the bovine sequence corresponding to the human exon 1bis is conserved and the canonical splice site at the 3'end  is present in cattle as well . however, we failed to obtain any rt-pcr product containing this exon 1bis, whereas we did amplify rt-pcr products harboring exon  <dig>  the difference in size of the region between the conserved line l <dig> sequence and exon  <dig>  is due to the presence in cattle of species-specific interspersed repeats, one line bov b and two sines, spanning approximately  <dig> kb.

we compared the bovine sequence to the corresponding region in mouse . the mouse cdna sequence  contains an untranslated exon  <dig> that is conserved with human and bovine exon  <dig>  there is no evidence in the genomic sequence of a sequence that might be similar to exon 1bis. the line l <dig> repeat is not present in mouse either.

the pparg and tsen <dig> genes are expressed in cattle as independent transcriptional units or as a hybrid pparg-tsen <dig> transcript
we used cdna from a set of bovine tissues to test the expression of the different transcripts. rt-pcr experiments were performed using three sets of primers specifically amplifying regions present in pparg transcripts only , tsen <dig> transcripts only  and chimeric transcripts only . the expected fragments were amplified in all tissues tested , suggesting the ubiquitous expression of both genes as well as of the chimeric transcripts. both long and short chimeric transcripts were present in all tissues tested but with variable proportion, the band corresponding to the long transcript being very faint in subcutaneous adipose tissue and brain. however, the same experiment was conducted on the same set of tissues from a different individual and these differences did not appear, suggesting that they may be due to individual variations and/or the quality of the rna.

the chimeric transcripts are expressed at a lower level compare to the pparg transcripts
we performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr experiments in order to compare the level of expression of the chimeric transcripts and the pparg transcripts. four different tissues from the same animal were tested and the relative expression of the different transcripts were normalized using the gapdh gene as control. the relative expression levels of the pparg transcripts  and the chimeric  transcripts are presented on figure  <dig>  because of the high ratio between the pparg and chimeric transcripts, we used a logarithmic scale in order to be able to display both values on the same figure. this ratio varies from  <dig> in adipose tissue to  <dig> in liver, with intermediate values in muscle and diaphragm. the amount of both pparg and chimeric transcripts is significantly different from one tissue to another and the ratio is not correlated to the relative level of expression. for instance, pparg is expressed at a similar level in liver and diaphragm while the ratio pparg/chimeric transcripts varies from  <dig> to  <dig> in these two tissues, respectively. this is most probably due to the variation in the activity of the different pparg promoters from one tissue to another.

the putative chimeric proteins are not detected on bovine tissues using immunodetection with an anti-pparγ antibody
we performed western blot experiments using a commercial anti-pparγ antibody. this antibody is directed against a peptide corresponding to the amino-acid residues 284– <dig> of mouse pparγ <dig> which corresponds to a region present in both pparγ <dig> and pparγ <dig>  this peptide is fully conserved in the human pparγ sequence and differs only from one amino-acid with the bovine pparγ sequence. it corresponds to a region encoded by the beginning of pparg exon  <dig>  which means that this region is present in the putative chimeric protein encoded by the short chimeric transcript. western blots experiments were performed on proteins isolated from human and bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue, bovine brain and skeletal muscle . a strong signal was obtained for all tissue at the expected size for pparγ <dig> and γ <dig>  but there was no evidence of a larger protein that could correspond to the chimeric protein which expected size was estimated to be around  <dig> kda.

chimeric transcripts are not detected in human or mouse
there is no evidence in the databases of any human and mouse chimeric cdna or est implying the pparg and tsen <dig> genes. we performed rt-pcr experiments on cdna isolated from human brain, adipocytes, mammary gland and skeletal muscle and a set of various mouse tissues  using primers designed on pparg  and tsen <dig> . transcripts specific of both genes were amplified in all tissues tested and confirmed by sequencing . however, even though we used several primer sets, we did not amplify any chimeric transcript.

in the three species, pparg exon  <dig> ends after the first nucleotide of a codon and the junction with tsen <dig> exon  <dig> would reconstitute this codon resulting in an in-frame connection between the pparg and tsen <dig> reading frames, the latter starting  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides downstream in cattle, human and mouse, respectively. however, whereas this short sequence between the two reading frames can be translated in cattle, it contains a stop codon in human and mouse. therefore, potential human or mouse chimeric transcripts with the same structure as bovine chimeric transcripts would anyway not encode any chimeric protein.

discussion
we describe here the existence of bovine chimeric transcripts resulting from intergenic splicing of two neighboring genes, pparg, encoding the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors γ <dig> and γ <dig> and tsen <dig>  encoding the trna splicing endonuclease  <dig> homolog. these two genes are situated about  <dig> kb apart in the same 5' 3' orientation on human chromosome 3p <dig> and bovine chromosome 22q <dig>  we identified two types of chimeric transcripts in cattle, differing by the presence/absence of an intermediate exon corresponding to a line l <dig> interspersed sequence situated in the 5' region of the tsen <dig> gene. there is no evidence of such a mechanism affecting these two genes in human or mouse. both types of chimeric transcripts contain all but the last exon of the pparg gene and all but the first exon of the tsen <dig> gene, which are normally the sites of termination and initiation of transcription, respectively. this situation is usually encountered in intergenic mrnas resulting from a bypass of transcriptional termination. however, the reasons why this occurs are still unknown. although this kind of event seems to be very rare, several examples have been reported, most of them affecting neighboring genes that are in the same orientation  <cit> . for the several cases described so far, the physical distance between the genes involved does not seem to have any influence. the genes p2ry <dig> and ppan are separated by only  <dig> bp  <cit> , whereas the disc <dig> and trax genes are separated by  <dig> kb  <cit>  and chimeric transcripts have been observed for genes of the cyp2c locus that are  <dig> to  <dig> kb apart  <cit> .

it is important to be cautious with the interpretation of "non-conventional" rt-pcr products such as chimeric transcripts since their existence can sometimes be attributed to experimental artifacts due to template-switching activities of the reverse transcriptase  or taq polymerase  <cit> . but the structure of the chimeric molecules appears to be related to the event they derive from, as shown for the hla class ii genes  <cit> . indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that the molecules we observe here are not in vitro artifacts. all transcripts are spliced using canonical splice sites whereas template switching activity is independent of splice sites. there is no sequence similarity that could contribute to a homology-dependent template switching. the fact that the two genes involved are adjacent to each-other and in the same orientation on the genome suggests the existence of a co-transcription unit due to a transcriptional termination bypass. moreover, in addition to the transcripts we observed, a bovine chimeric est is present in the est database.

the reason why this mechanism occurs between the pparg and tsen <dig> genes in cattle but not in human and mouse is not clear. furthermore, we observed that chimeric mrna molecules are transcribed from the pparγ <dig> promoter only. both genes are conserved in sequence, structure, position and orientation in the three species. sequence comparison of the pparγ <dig> promoter region in human, mouse and cattle shows a high level of identity . the full pparγ <dig> promoter genomic sequence was not available for cattle but it does not harbor any significant sequence similarity between human and mouse and the a <dig> exon is not conserved in sequence across the three species. this suggests that this promoter region might have species-specific functions among which is splicing regulation. indeed, there is now evidence that the promoter structure for polymerase ii plays such a role by coupling the transcription and splicing machineries .

the gene fusion event may also be the result of a weak termination signal for pparg gene transcription. however, we demonstrate that normal pparg and tsen <dig> transcripts are also expressed, meaning that normal transcription termination and co-transcription of the two genes co-exist. semi-quantitative rt-pcr showed that the amount of chimeric transcripts was much lower  than the amount of pparg transcripts, suggesting that this phenomenon is either strictly regulated, or results from a weak leakage in the cleavage/polyadenylation of the pparg transcripts. a sequence comparison of the 3'end of the pparg gene in human, mouse and cattle revealed a high sequence identity between the three species. the polyadenylation site in the three species seems to be situated between a highly conserved at-rich sequence and a reasonably conserved gt-rich sequence. these two structures constitute the most commonly found features for post-transcriptional processing. however, there is no obvious difference between the bovine and the mouse or human sequences that could explain a malfunction in cattle only. sequence analysis shows that the reading frames of both genes cannot be joined in human and mouse in the same way they are in the bovine short chimeric transcript. this might explain why chimeric transcripts are not found in these two species and would suggest that their presence in cattle has functional significance.

we could not establish the existence of the chimeric protein in vivo. this may be due to the fact that the expression might be very low and thus be undetectable by immunodetection, as suggested by the relative quantification of the different transcripts. it is also possible that the translation of the chimeric transcripts is subjected to a strict regulation, i.e they are not translated at all. indeed, although fusion transcripts for a number of genes have been reported, the existence of a fusion protein was reported only in the case of mask-4e-bp <dig>  <cit> . the functional significance of a chimeric protein resulting from the translation of a fusion transcript between the pparg and tsen <dig> genes is difficult to assess since these two genes have specific functions that do not have a priori anything in common. the fusion protein would contain the first  <dig> amino acids from pparγ <dig>  the complete sen <dig> protein and an intermediate region of  <dig> amino-acids resulting from the translation of the normally-untranslated part of tsen <dig> exon  <dig>  such protein would include the dna-binding domain and part of the ligand-binding domain of pparγ <dig>  and the trna intron endonuclease catalytic c terminal domain of sen <dig>  the sen <dig> protein binds to sen <dig>  sen <dig> and sen <dig>  forming the trna endonuclease complex and was also shown to form complexes with clp <dig>  which is a member of the human pre-mrna 3'end processing complex, involved in the cleavage/polyadenylation of pre-mrnas  <cit> . it is puzzling to see that tsen <dig> appears to be involved in a phenomenon presumably due to a malfunction in the mechanisms of pre-mrna maturation, while it is precisely one of the functions of the protein encoded by this gene.

the existence of fusion transcripts between unrelated genes is often referred to as a pathological phenomenon resulting, for example, from chromosomal translocations responsible for deregulation of gene expression and oncogene activation  <cit> . but is is tempting to speculate that non-conventional transcripts may encode new proteins with new functions. hybrids between heterologous mrnas, generated by mrna trans-splicing or transcription of long mrna across neighbouring loci may provide the cell with the potential for evolution and adaptation by acquiring new functions. with the increasing availability of sequence data for genomes and transcripts, it is likely that new cases of chimeric mrna molecules will be found. an in-silico based approach on the unigene database revealed that ~1% of the transcripts are chimeric  <cit> . non-linear splice forms can also be generated by rearrangement or repetition in exon order , leading to either shorter reading frames or repetition of a given domain  <cit> . these computer-based studies probably give an over-estimate of the number of such non-conventional mrna molecules because of the presence of artefactual sequences, and their sensitivity needs to be improved. however, these observations clearly suggest a biological significance of this phenomenon.

CONCLUSIONS
chimeric mrna molecules resulting from cotranscription and trans-splicing of the neighboring genes pparg and tsen <dig> were indentified in cattle. the existence of these transcripts appears to be restricted to the bovine species and is probably the consequence of a modification in the transcriptional termination regulation. the functional significance of this phenomenon, if any, remains to be determined. however, this might be an example of a way for a species to increase complexity and diversity at the protein level.
