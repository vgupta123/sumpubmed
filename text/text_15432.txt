BACKGROUND
circadian rhythms, periodicities with an approximate 24-h length, are essential physiological functions in almost all organisms on the earth and are generated by endogenous biological clocks. the biological clocks consist of  <dig> components: input, pacemaker, and output. the endogenous period length is not exactly  <dig> h and must be entrained by light. in mammals, other entrainment cues such as food intake or temperature, even social cues, can reset the circadian rhythm. the central oscillator in mammals is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei  in the anteroventral hypothalamus. recent studies revealed that the peripheral clocks reside not only in other brain regions but also in peripheral organs and even in cultured cells  <cit> . the output of the biological clocks includes broad physiological phenomena such as locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycle, hormonal secretion, cardiovascular condition, bowel movement, and even mental states. the disturbance of the biological clocks may cause many dysfunctions from routinely experienced jet-lag or work-shift problems to sleep disturbance and cardiovascular, metabolic or mental diseases  <cit> .

recent molecular biological studies have revealed that the molecular mechanism of the biological clocks is based on the interlocked loops of transcriptional and translational feedback  <cit> . among the transcriptional controls in mammals,  <dig> major clock components for canonical clock genes, i.e., e-box, rore, and dbpe, have been reported so far  <cit> . the e-box , for example, in the per <dig> promoter, is the most well-known regulatory element. it is considered the binding site for the heterocomplex of clock/bmal <dig>  which is a positive regulatory element. negative regulatory elements, pers and crys, restrain the transcriptional activity  <cit> . it is widely known that not only other clock genes are regulated by the e-box but also output regulators or clock-controlled genes are regulated by it as well  <cit> . on the other hand, bmal <dig>  whose circadian expression exhibits a sort of anti-phase to per <dig> expression, is positively regulated by rorα and negatively regulated by rev-erbα, through rore  <cit> .

per <dig> was literally cloned as a second mammalian period gene  <cit> , however, gene-knockout analysis revealed a more prominent role for mper <dig> in the mammalian clock than per <dig>  <cit> . using the in vitro rhythm oscillation monitoring system   <cit> , instead of the canonical e-box , we previously identified an e-box-like sequence  in the per <dig> promoter region in vitro  <cit> , which is essential for the cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of per <dig> as well as for per <dig> circadian oscillations in vivo  <cit> . for the cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of per <dig>  not only this e-box-like sequence but also the downstream region is involved in the circadian oscillation of per <dig>  <cit> . here, we identified closely spaced e-box or e-box-like elements in the regulatory regions of canonical clock genes including per <dig>  our comprehensive approach raised the possibility that not just a single e-box but a direct repeat of e-box-like elements is required for circadian oscillation of core clock and clock-controlled genes.

RESULTS
our previous study demonstrated that an e-box-like sequence  and its downstream region are essential for transcriptional oscillation of per <dig>  a crucial component of molecular clocks  <cit> . comparing with other mammalian genome sequences, within the conserved regions among mammalian  genomes, we found that an e-box-like sequence followed by another non-canonical e-box with 6-base pairs  between the two . in addition to per <dig>  we found a similar e-box or e-box-like sequence followed by another e-box-like sequence with an intervening space of  <dig> bp in per <dig> and per <dig>  which are other mammalian period homologues, in their upstream promoter region close to the transcription start site . the e-box or e-box-like sequences distal and proximal to tss were dubbed e <dig> and e <dig>  respectively, and collectively as the "ee-element" . these sequences are well conserved among diverse mammals, such as human, rhesus, rat, and mouse, and even the opossum which is evolutionally located at the farthest branch from humans among the mammals. to examine whether these ee-elements are involved in transcriptional oscillation, we performed the iv-roms established in our previous study by using the following constructs: the oligonucleotides of  <dig>  ee-elements were inserted upstream of the sv <dig> promoter in a luciferase  plasmid, and the constructed plasmids were used to transfect mouse nih3t <dig> cells. all  <dig> ee-elements gave significant oscillation of luciferase activity but the amplitudes were different among the genes . the hper <dig> ee-element displayed the most robust oscillation, whereas the hper <dig> ee-element gave the lowest amplitude, which correlated with the patterns derived from luc-constructs containing the longer promoter regions  <cit> . the amplitude in circadian oscillation seemed to correlate with the number of mismatches in the e <dig> sequence. in fact, a mutant hper <dig> ee-element, in which the gag at the end of the e <dig> sequence was replaced with canonical gtg, exhibited a higher amplitude than the wild-type hper <dig> ee-element .

to investigate whether both e <dig> and e <dig> were necessary for generating the cell-autonomous oscillation, we again performed iv-roms with the use of the mutant hper <dig> ee-element constructs. not only the double e-box-like mutations  but also the single e-box-like mutation  resulted in drastically reduced circadian transcription or led to an almost complete loss of transactivation . a longer per <dig> promoter  with double e-element mutants showed that the amplitude was heavily reduced, with circadian transcription hardly being observed . these results are similar to those obtained with mutations of  <dig> rores in the bmal <dig> promoter  <cit>  and suggest that these  <dig> e-box-like elements function in per <dig> transactivation.

to see whether endogenous clock transcription factors, bmal <dig> and clock, could bind to the ee-element, we investigated the binding of endogenous bmal <dig> and clock to hper <dig> double-stranded dna fragment immobilized on streptoavidin beads . for this experiment, we raised specific antibodies against bmal <dig> . mouse liver lysates were prepared at 4-h intervals and immunoblotted with antibodies against bmal <dig> or clock . when the lysates were incubated with the bead-bound per <dig> oligonucleotides and electrophoresis performed, followed by immunoblotting, bands corresponding to bmal <dig> and clock were detected . the shifted bands seen correspond to phosphorylated bmal1; and its phosphorylation level peaked around at ct   <dig>  which is consistent with our previous data obtained with the per <dig> promoter  <cit> . in contrast, the oligonucleotides with the same length but having scrambled sequences bound neither bmal <dig> nor clock proteins. the amounts of bmal <dig> and clock pulled down with mutant e1m or with the double-mutant e1me2m were drastically reduced or almost undetectable compared with those pulled-down by the wild-type ee-element . this result suggests that the endogenous bmal <dig> and clock proteins bound to the e <dig> element but not to e <dig>  on the other hand, when we used the e2m oligonucleotide, precipitated bmal <dig> and clock proteins were substantially detected. these results suggest that the binding of clock/bmal <dig> to e <dig> and that of unknown factors to e <dig> are necessary for cell-autonomous circadian transcription.

we next examined the length of the space between e <dig> and e <dig>  because the spaces between two e-box-like elements were  <dig> bp in all of  <dig> pers ee-elements . to see whether the space length was crucial for cell-autonomous circadian transcription, we constructed different spaces  between e <dig> and e <dig> of the hper <dig> ee-element and performed iv-roms . sp <dig>  in which there were  <dig> bp spacing nucleotides between the  <dig> e-elements, yielded a circadian rhythmicity of per <dig> transcription but with a slightly diminished amplitude compared with the wild-type oligonucleotide. the amplitude of sp <dig> and sp <dig>  or sp <dig>  displayed almost no or no oscillation of per <dig>  respectively. these results demonstrate that the spacing between the  <dig> e-elements was critical for rhythm generation and that the 6-bp  space was necessary for cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation. thus the ee-element for circadian rhythm may be defined as follows: 1) e <dig> and e <dig> allow  <dig> and  <dig> base mismatches, respectively, and 2) the space between the  <dig> e-elements is  <dig> or  <dig> bp .

previous studies  <cit>  in which clock or clock-controlled genes were extensively examined at the transcriptional level by dna microarrays revealed that a total of  <dig> genes exhibited circadian oscillation. so we examined how many genes contained the ee-element that met our criteria described above in their promoter regions within  <dig> kb upstream from the tss. as a consequence of in silico analysis,  <dig> ee-elements in  <dig> genes were found among  <dig> genes, which sequences are available from the vista database . the genes that appeared in different papers and organs were clock and clock-controlled genes, such as nr1d <dig> , dbp, avp and tef, besides per <dig>  this result strongly suggests that not a single e-box but a direct repeat of e-box-like elements is essential for the generation of cell-autonomous circadian oscillation. to confirm this, by using iv-roms we investigated whether the ee-element in dbp was also required for its rhythmicity. the hdbp ee-element showed circadian oscillation as well as the hper <dig> one . the mutants of e <dig> and/or e <dig> in the ee-element as well as the space mutants, sp <dig>  sp <dig>  and sp <dig> displayed no rhythmicity , which is consistent with the results of per <dig> described above.

discussion
among the genes identified by in silico analysis , arginine vasopressin  is a neuropeptide physiologically synthesized in the hypothalamus in a circadian manner but pathologically expressed by small-cell lung cancer. in the latter case, upstream stimulatory factor , another bhlh transcription factor, activates the vasopressin promoter via the adjacent non-canonical e-boxes in tandem with a 6-nucleotides space between them and the second e-box is important for full enhancer function of the first e-box  <cit> . furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig> , a bhlh-pas transcription factor, has recently been reported to regulate some hypoxia-inducible genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor  through an hif- <dig> binding site and its downstream hif- <dig> ancillary sequence, both of which are non-canonical e-boxes  <cit> . the space between these motifs in this case is  <dig> nucleotides and is crucial for activity of promoter. not only mammalian genes but also fly clock genes contain a direct repeat of e-box-like elements, as discovered in this study. the drosophila timeless promoter includes an e-box-like sequence dubbed ter <dig> and is considered as an ee-element together with its 7-bp downstream canonical e-box. this ter <dig> plays a major role in tim transcription  <cit> . these reports in addition to this study demonstrate that not a single e-box but an ee-element is crucial for transcriptional activation by certain bhlh transcription factors.

our results suggest that  <dig> dimeric complexes of transcription factors bind to the  <dig> e-box-like elements with a short distance between them, such as  <dig> nucleotides. to support this possibility, we simulated this binding of bhlh transcription factors to the ee-element on the dna by using the crystal structure of the bhlh domain of the myc-max heterodimer bound to dna   <cit> . since  <dig> turn of double-helix dna is approximately  <dig> Å and requires  <dig>  nucleotides, the distance from the beginning of e <dig> to the end of space, which consists of  <dig> nucleotides, spans  <dig>  Å . two binding faces form a  <dig> -degree angle . the maximum dimension of the bhlh structure, which lies along the dna, is about  <dig> Å . this dimension is within the  <dig> Å calculated above and allows the binding. when the space is  <dig> nucleotides, for example, the distance between  <dig> complexes shortens approximately  <dig> Å horizontally compared with the case of  <dig> nucleotides; however, the angle between them becomes  <dig> °. this precludes the possibility that the bhlh structure binds to the ee-element, because  <dig> whole structures including pas domains may collide with each other. this simulation supports our contention that  <dig> nucleotides between  <dig> e-box-like elements, not  <dig> nucleotides, allow the binding of bhlh transcription factors to the ee-element on the dna.

as a candidate for unknown factors that bind to e <dig>  another type of transcription factor can be a possible candidate as well as the bhlh family transcription factor including hif <dig>  <cit>  or the bzip family transcription factor e4bp <dig>   <cit> . our preliminary emsa suggests that some proteins may bind to e <dig> . alternatively, different forms of the clock and bmal <dig> complex can be involved in this circadian transcription. the circadian transcriptional complex includes at least clock, npas <dig>  bmal <dig>  pers and crys, probably in different combinations, and these proteins can be posttranslationally modified  <cit> . while e <dig> element is sufficient for binding of clock and bmal <dig>  it is possible that binding to e <dig> can occur only after clock and/or bmal <dig> originally binds to e <dig>  thus e <dig> can be necessary for the binding of different forms of the complex or perhaps the binding to e <dig> is important for complex activation. further studies, including identification of unknown factors or the circadian transcription complex and their crystal structures, will be required to elucidate the precise mechanism of transcriptional activation via an ee-element.

CONCLUSIONS
here we identified a direct repeat of e-box-like elements consisting of a canonical e-box or non-canonical e-box in tandem with an e-box-like element, having a short interval of  <dig> base pairs between them. although other regions outside the ee-element seem to be active in robust circadian oscillation with high amplitude  <cit> , the ee-element identified in this study, not a single e-box, is the minimal required element for the generation of cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of clock and clock-controlled genes.
