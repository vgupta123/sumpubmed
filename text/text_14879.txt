BACKGROUND
the placenta is the first human tissue to start developing once the embryo implants into to the mother’s uterus shortly after conception. at implantation, placental trophoblast cells begin to invade into the lining of the uterus, where they colonise and transform the mother’s spiral arteries and the extra-embryonic tissue placental tissue establishes its own network of blood vessels. together these processes facilitate the exchange of all nutrients, gases and waste throughout pregnancy. normal placental function is dependent on appropriate growth and development of its structural components, which are underpinned by the fine-tuned regulation of gene expression. consequently, alterations to placental gene regulation are thought to be a major contributor to pregnancy pathologies. several studies aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of placental development have utilised high-throughput gene expression technologies, such as rna sequencing  and microarrays, and show that the placenta undergoes global shifts in gene expression across human gestation . they also show that placentas from pre-eclamptic pregnancies feature a distinct expression signature , and that some of these expression differences arise approximately six months before the condition manifests  <cit> . recently, two placental transcriptome studies employing rna-seq have described the breadth of gene expression in the human placenta and show that the placenta exhibits unique patterns of exon splicing and greater than four-fold enrichment for > <dig> genes compared to other human tissues  <cit> .

a common feature in previous studies on placental gene regulation is that expression data are typically summarised at the gene level for between-group comparisons, widely known as differential expression. with differential expression, the greatest significance is attributed to individual genes where the differences between groups reach an appropriate significance threshold. although differential expression analyses have unquestionable utility, the inherent natural organisation of the transcriptome remains largely unexplored. conversely, co-expression analyses that consider the gene-wise relationships in gene expression data have cast new light on previously unappreciated patterns of transcriptional organisation with regards to processes and functions such as lipid metabolism  <cit> , cancer  <cit> , human brain development and neuropathology , and embryonic development  <cit> . gene co-expression analyses identify groups of genes where expression levels are highly correlated across samples. by leveraging the inter-individual expression variability between biological samples, a co-expression analysis can enable the identification of higher-order relationships among genes. further post hoc characterisation of these relationships can then provide insight into the biological processes arising from the underlying transcriptional program. therefore, to gain a new perspective on placental genome regulation across human gestation and between human and mouse, we performed a comprehensive analysis of placental gene co-expression.

RESULTS
rna sequencing
to explore patterns of gene co-expression in the healthy human term placenta, we performed single-strand 100-base paired-end total rna-seq for  <dig> samples, obtaining a total of  <dig>  billion paired reads with and average of  <dig> million reads per library. the mapping rate was  <dig>  ± <dig> % with an average of  <dig>  ± <dig>  million uniquely mapped pairs per library overlapping annotated genes . by summarising the rna-seq reads by counting the number of overlaps with hg <dig> genes , we detected  <dig>  genes  above the threshold of > <dig> read count per million, which we show is an accurate threshold of detection based on quantification of spiked synthetic rnas . the normalised gene expression values were also highly correlated , with a pearson’s correlation coefficient for each pair being  <dig>  ± <dig> .

constructing a weighted human placental co-expression gene network
to integrate gene-level expression profiles into a higher-order systems level framework, normalised gene expression values were used to perform a weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit> . to construct the gene-wise network, we first calculated pearson’s correlation matrix, then raised this matrix to a power to weight strong correlations at the expense of weaker ones, thus resulting in a weighted network . to identify groups of genes with highly correlated patterns of expression, these data were then transformed into a topological overlap matrix of ‘connection-strengths’  <cit> . this was then used as input for unsupervised hierarchical clustering, where we employed a dynamic tree-cutting algorithm  <cit>  to group tree branches into  <dig> distinct clusters of highly connected genes, which we refer to as modules .

each module was then summarised by calculating the module eigengene for each sample, which is the first principal component of gene expression values for the module. therefore, the eigengene represents a weighted average of gene expression. for each gene, we then define its membership in each module as the absolute correlation between the gene’s expression and the module’s eigengene, and represent this correlation as kme  <cit> . genes are assigned to modules if they have an absolute kme> <dig> . note that by quantifying membership through correlation, module membership for each gene is no longer binary and allows genes to be members of more than one module , thus connecting modules in a network.

the proportion of gene expression variation explained by each eigengene ranged between  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  . this demonstrates that even for large modules such as m <dig> , a significant proportion of variance can be captured by a single representative value. for each gene module, the top hub genes  are reported in table  <dig>  and genes with a kme> <dig>  for each module are listed in additional file  <dig>  the plots in fig.  <dig> demonstrate the high correlation of the top ten most connected genes for modules m <dig> and m <dig>  and how gene variance is accurately reflected by the module eigengene.

as our dataset featured equal number of samples from male and female fetuses, we expected that at least one co-expression module would be correlated with fetal sex status and would serve as a positive control. to test this, we performed a chromosomal enrichment test which identified module m <dig> to be significantly enriched for y chromosome genes . accordingly, m <dig> eigengene expression was also significantly higher for male samples .

as placental gene expression has previously been shown to be influenced by method of delivery and the onset of labor  <cit> , we tested for an association of delivery method  and found no significant associations for any co-expression module . we further tested for eigengene correlations with birthweight and gestational age at delivery and found that m <dig> eigengene expression was moderately correlated with birthweight , however this correlation failed to remain significant after bonferroni correction.

co-expression modules are reproducible
to evaluate the reproducibility of these gene modules in the third trimester placenta, we utilized rna-seq data from a previously published study on the human placental transcriptome  <cit>  and tested whether the density and connectivity patterns of gene modules we defined in our reference dataset were preserved. to quantify reproducibility, we applied a preservation permutation test  <cit>  to summarise evidence that the network topology is preserved in independent test sets and report the z
summary statistic to summarise module preservation. in this independent third trimester dataset, 4/ <dig> modules show highly significant preservation scores z

key co-expression modules are preserved across human gestation and conserved in the mouse
given that the human placenta undergoes significant growth and remodeling throughout the nine months of gestation  <cit> , we reasoned that if particular co-expression modules were involved in core placental functions, then these modules would be reproducible using gene expression data from earlier gestational time points. to test this hypothesis, we obtained microarray gene expression data from placental tissue collected during the first   <cit>  and second trimesters   <cit> . although these datasets contain expression data for substantially fewer genes after filtering and annotation , the module preservation statistics indicate that a majority of modules are nevertheless preserved across gestation at a low to moderate level of significance . in particular, m <dig> shows moderate preservation z
summary> <dig> across all gestational time points, indicating a conserved pattern of gene regulation throughout human gestation. in contrast, the m <dig> module is highly preserved in the third trimester datasets z
summary> <dig> with little to no evidence of preservation during the first or second trimesters, suggesting m <dig> genes constitute a molecular program more specific to third trimester placental functions.

as the mouse is the most widely utilised model for studying placental development, we next asked whether the co-expression gene modules were conserved between human and mouse. to achieve this, we obtained raw rna-seq data  for  <dig> mid-gestation  mouse placenta samples  <cit>  and showed that 5/ <dig> had some degree of evidence for module preservation z
summary> <dig>  with m <dig> showing a highly significant preservation score z
summary> <dig> . to further validate the conservation of co-expression between human and mouse, we assembled an independent and unsupervised de novo mouse co-expression network using the same methods as our human dataset. by counting the overlapping genes for each module and performing fisher exact tests, we show that five human modules have at least one mouse counterpart . as predicted from the human–mouse z
summary statistics, m <dig> showed the highest degree of overlap with a mouse module  and a highly significant kme correlation .

preserved modules feature a core set of transcription factor motifs
as several co-expression modules appeared to be highly conserved, we tested the 10kb up and downstream of genes in each module for enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs. this identified  <dig> transcription factors as potential regulators of co-expression , several of which were detectable in the placenta at the rna level and predicted to target multiple conserved co-expression modules. as m <dig> genes appeared to constitute the most highly conserved transcriptional network in this study , we then further analyzed the transcription factors that were detectable in the placenta at the rna level and predicted to target m <dig> genes. this identified znf <dig> and ebf <dig> which were both also members of the m <dig> module , and highly correlated with the m <dig> eigengene . znf <dig> has previously been reported to interact with ebf <dig> . here we show a majority of m <dig> genes with znf423-binding motifs also feature ebf <dig> motifs , and the density of these motifs is greatest immediately upstream of m <dig> transcription start sites . these multiple lines of evidence suggest znf <dig> and ebf <dig> are potential regulators of m <dig> gene transcription. when we performed the same enrichment tests for all other modules, znf <dig> and ebf <dig> were predicted to target a high proportion of genes within other co-expression modules . further inquiry revealed that the most highly preserved modules across human gestation, and between human and mouse , feature a core set of tf-binding motifs , suggesting these co-expressed genes share common regulatory elements and have a high degree of flanking sequence similarity.

modules of co-expressed genes are implicated in pregnancy complications
the origins of several pregnancy pathologies, such as preterm birth  and preeclampsia  are largely attributed to abnormal placental development . if co-expression modules constitute gene networks involved in placental development, we reasoned that if a particular module underpinned key placental processes, it may be enriched for genes implicated in pregnancy complications. to address this question, we obtained a curated gene list from the ptb gene database  <cit> , and a set of meta-analysis-validated differentially expressed genes in pe  <cit> , and tested our co-expression gene modules for enrichment of genes implicated in these pathologies . m <dig> was statistically enriched for genes associated with ptb , but more strikingly, modules m <dig> and m <dig> showed significant enrichment for pe-related genes . notably, three m <dig> intramodular hub genes  have consistently been shown to be up-regulated in pe  <cit> . this provided the first line of evidence that m <dig> gene co-expression genes may be altered in pe.

to further validate the finding that m <dig> was enriched for genes differentially expressed in pe, we obtained additional independent microarray expression data from a recent study on early-onset pe   <cit>  and tested for differences in m <dig> and m <dig> gene expression. first, a rotation gene set test  <cit>  showed that  of m <dig> genes are significantly up-regulated in the pe placenta , with m <dig> showing no significant enrichment . when testing for differential expression of all genes in preeclampsia versus controls independently,  <dig> genes were significant  with m <dig> showing the highest proportion of differentially expressed genes . this independent analysis thus provides a second line of evidence for the involvement of m <dig> genes in preeclampsia . following this, we calculated the first principal component for m <dig> genes in this dataset to obtain an eigengene measure, and showed that m <dig> eigengene expression is significantly different  between pe and control . this demonstrated the robust nature of the eigengene for testing for differences in gene regulation between control and pe pregnancies. together, these results implicate m <dig> co-expressed genes in pe and suggest that the mechanisms regulating m <dig> co-expression may be altered in pe.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
by conducting this comprehensive co-expression network analysis of the human placental transcriptome, we reveal previously unappreciated aspects of transcriptional organisation at the fetal-maternal interface. this analysis entailed the integration of multiple gene expression datasets and curated databases, which enabled the testing of specific hypotheses regarding placental genome regulation.

our results demonstrate that a large proportion of the placental transcriptome is organised into distinct modules of co-expressed genes, some of which are preserved across gestation, and conserved between human and mouse. the reproducibility of these networks, constructed from independent datasets and different platforms  suggest a fundamental modular organisation of the placental transcriptome. moreover, our cross-species analysis demonstrates that certain aspects of human placental transcriptional organisation are highly preserved in the mouse, indicating the evolutionary conservation of molecular processes which drive mammalian placental development.

when comparing the de novo human and mouse networks, five genes were identified as m3/m <dig> intramodular hub genes  in both species , demonstrating a high degree of inter-species module reproducibility. these hub genes are centrally located within the m <dig> module and may be critical components of the network. of particular interest, dock <dig> mutations in humans are associated with extreme placental angiopathy and a severely abnormal placental phenotype  <cit> , while dock <dig> expression is reported to be down-regulated in placentas from growth-restricted fetuses  <cit> . similarly, osbpl <dig>  an oxysterol-binding protein, is also reported to be differentially expressed in placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies  <cit> . for genes that do not have any previously reported placental phenotype association, these could be potential novel candidates for involvement in placental development. given the size of the m <dig> co-expression module, it is reasonable to expect that these genes would be involved in multiple cellular processes. the results of the gene ontology analysis do indicate that m <dig> genes are involved in processes such as cell adhesion, cardiovascular system development, growth-factor binding and extracellular matrix structre. together, there results suggests that the m <dig> co-expression network may be involved in multiple levels of placental development and regulation.

investigation of the tfs that potentially regulate co-expression revealed that the most preserved modules are predicted to be regulated by a core set of transcription factors, including the m <dig> genes ebf <dig> and znf <dig>  which potentially target a high proportion of genes in the most highly preserved modules. although the effects of znf <dig> and ebf <dig> on placental gene regulation remain largely unexplored, znf <dig> appears to be a multi-functional transcription factor associated with b cell regulation, retinoic acid signalling, notch signalling, dna damage response pathways, adipogenesis and cancer  <cit> . furthermore, homozygous mutation in the homologous gene in mice  results in smaller ataxic pups who die shortly after birth  <cit> . this indicates a critical role for znf <dig> in development. ebf <dig> can act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor and has known roles in tumour suppression  <cit> . when ebf <dig> binds dna directly as a dimer, it can activate transcription via p300-cbp co-activation  <cit> . in other contexts, the same dna binding dimer in conjunction with znf <dig> can recruit the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase  complex, triggering ebf1-mediated transcriptional repression  <cit> . the observation that ebf <dig> and znf <dig> are co-expressed in the placenta and members of the m <dig> module, and their widespread targeting potential across modules of co-expressed genes indicates that these tfs are candidate key regulators of transcription in the placenta.

the identification of m <dig> being enriched for genes implicated in pe demonstrates the utility of a co-expression analysis for identifying genes that may respond to the pathology, or may indeed underlie its aetiology. this guilt-by-association approach, clustered genes implicated in pe  in a completely unsupervised manner, suggesting expression differences in these genes are driven by a set of common factors. the observation that several m <dig> hub genes are up-regulated in pe, and show highly correlated patterns of expression, implies that expression of other genes within this module is likely driven by the same underlying factors, together indicating that these genes are implicated in placental development. moreover, the m <dig> network is preserved in the first trimester , the period where the pathogenesis of pe is considered to have its origins  <cit> . furthermore, these patterns of co-expression do not appear to be conserved in the mouse. although human and mouse placental development have many similarities, it is also important to note that mice do not develop preeclampsia. together, these findings indicate further investigation of the involvement of m <dig> genes and their upstream regulators in human placental development may be a valuable way of generating new hypotheses regarding the placental origins of pe.

concordant with our results, several m <dig> hub genes such as ndrg <dig>  inha, inhba were central to both protein-protein interaction networks  <cit>  and co-expression networks  <cit>  implicated in pe in previous studies. of particular interest, the intramodular m <dig> hub gene pvrl <dig>  which is up-regulated in pe  <cit> , is expressed more highly in the placenta compared to other human tissues  <cit> . pvrl <dig> is a potent mediator of epithelial cell colony formation  <cit>  and is also highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissue  <cit> . furthermore, cleaved pvrl <dig> is elevated in the serum of patients with ovarian cancer and is correlated with pvrl <dig> expression  <cit> , suggesting that maternal serum pvrl <dig> may hold potential as a biomarker of pe. together, these results suggest a potential role for m <dig> genes in the pathogenesis of pe.

one limitation of our study is the number of samples we have used to construct our co-expression networks, and the expression levels of some hub genes are relatively low. however, we are confident that our expression measurements are reasonably accurate at these levels as we emperically determined a threshold of detection using spike-in rnas . furthermore, we have bolstered our analysis by incorporating multiple independent datasets to validate our results assess the preservation of co-expression networks. secondly, as different placental biopsies can feature differing contributions of maternal versus fetal cells between different gestational ages and sampling methodologies, there are inherent limitations in comparing data between studies. this may be one underlying factor in driving the differences we observe between our dataset and the third trimeser validation dataset. we also recognise that the second trimester gene expression data  were from basal plate tissue collected from pre-term birth deliveries so they may not be directly comparable to the villous tissue data collected from uncomplicated pregnancies. additionally, the mouse placental tissue we have re-analyzed  was collected at approximately mid gestation  therefore the comparison with the late gestation human tissue should be interpreted with some caution. however, given the rarity of some of samples used in our analysis, we are of the opinion that the comparisons made still have value.

several new questions arise from this comprehensive co-expression network analysis. firstly, are patterns of co-expression altered in placental pathologies? our analysis of independent expression datasets from pe placentas provide compelling preliminary evidence that m <dig> genes are up-regulated in pe, which warrants further investigation into the regulators of m <dig> genes. secondly, what genetic and environmental factors influence co-expression? a comprehensive assessment of genotypes and environmental factors such as maternal diet has the potential to reveal drivers of placental expression variation. thirdly, does silencing of hub genes shift module co-expression and influence placental cell phenotype and behavior? functional studies aimed toward elucidating the biological function of co-expression modules may yield new insights into how placental development is regulated.

in summary, we show that a weighted gene co-expression network analysis can provide novel insights into the functional organisation of the placental transcriptome. to the best of our knowledge, the networks described herein have not been described previously, and emphasise that these findings could not be revealed through conventional gene-level summaries or differential expression experiments. in typical differential expression analyses, emphasis is placed on genes where the expression differences reach an appropriate level of significance. although such experiments have contributed significantly to our understanding of placental genome regulation, the significance of each gene is typically determined in isolation, subsequently failing to connect genes in a manner that reflects the functional organisation of the transcriptome. by connecting genes in a manner that reflects underlying genome regulatory programs, we have exposed previously unappreciated aspects of the placental transcriptional landscape and provide a framework for multiple avenues of post hoc inquiry.
