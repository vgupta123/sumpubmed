BACKGROUND
venomous marine cone snails have evolved a broad array of peptide toxins, called conopeptides, for prey capture and defense. these small bioactive compounds selectively act on a wide variety of receptors and channels in the central and peripheral nervous systems
 <cit> . these vast, mostly untapped, natural toxin libraries provide potent tools for studying the properties of these targets and have become a platform for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals
 <cit> . only ~2% of the estimated > <dig>  venom peptides expressed by the genus conus have been sequenced to date
 <cit> .

in the apical secretory cells lining the long convoluted venom duct
 <cit>  , mature mrna is translated to precursor conopeptides which are generally composed of three distinct regions: a n-terminal endoplasmic reticulum  signal sequence, a central pro-peptide region, and the c-terminal mature toxin. based on the conservation of their signal sequence, conopeptides are currently classified into  <dig> empirical gene superfamilies , and  <dig> minor families for those identified in early divergent clade species
 <cit> . in addition,  <dig> new superfamilies have been discovered in the past two years - b1
 <cit> , b2
 <cit> , b3
 <cit> , c
 <cit> , e
 <cit> , f
 <cit> , g
 <cit> , h
 <cit> , k
 <cit> , n
 <cit> . conopeptides can also be further divided into secondary classes based on the number of disulfide bonds they can contain - disulfide-rich conopeptides containing at least  <dig> disulfide bonds are colloquially known as conotoxins, whereas those with none or one disulfide bond are called disulfide-poor conopeptides
 <cit>  - or the cysteine patterns in the mature region of disulfide-rich conopeptides
 <cit> . although amino acid conservation in the pro- and mature regions of conopeptides from the same superfamily is much lower than for the er signal sequence , consensus cysteine patterns and connectivities are often highly conserved  and may be linked to particular pharmacological families
 <cit> .
1/λ=1/∑i=1rpi <dig>  for each amino acid position, a color gradient applies to the diversity index .

recent studies have reported the existence of new conopeptides, which do not clearly belong to any of the previous annotated superfamilies but share common pharmacological targets. although some show conserved signal regions, cysteine motifs or specific post-translational modifications, these conotoxins have been incorporated into  <dig> additional classes
 <cit>  called conantokin
 <cit> , conodipine
 <cit> , conohyal
 <cit> , conolysin
 <cit> , conomap
 <cit> , conomarphin
 <cit> , conopeptide y
 <cit> , conophan
 <cit> , conoporin
 <cit> , conopressin
 <cit> , conorfamide
 <cit> , conotoxin-like
 <cit> , contryphan
 <cit>  and contulakin
 <cit> .

advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, combined with directed studies of venom producing cells
 <cit> , have resulted in a data deluge which requires dedicated tools for the analysis and classification of conopeptide sequences. conoserver, a specialized database dedicated to conopeptides
 <cit> , implemented a web-based tool  that guides gene superfamily assignment of precursor toxins by the recognition of a limited number of known cleavage sites  and a sequence similarity search based on existing conopeptide superfamilies
 <cit> . however, the limitations of this program include the restriction to known conopeptide motifs, as well as a requirement that the query precursor sequences contain the signal region, which is rarely the case as most conopeptide screening is conducted on milked venom or dissected venom gland that almost exclusively contains mature protein products. another web-based program, conodictor, overcomes the issue of missing signal regions by using three independent sets of models built from signal, pro- and mature regions of conopeptides respectively
 <cit> . however, this tool only accepts selected amino acid sequences as input, only classifies conopeptides into the main superfamilies, does not provide any data quantitation, and perhaps most importantly, cannot facilitate the discovery of new conopeptide families. both conoprec and conodictor are limited in their ability to handle large transcriptomic or proteomic datasets, and therefore are unlikely to fill the need for large-scale analysis of cone snail transcriptomes or proteomes.

here we describe conosorter, a program able to classify conopeptides into superfamilies and classes from either protein sequences or rna sequencing data. conosorter has been designed to recognize all currently annotated gene superfamilies and classes. regular expression sequence searches are complemented by a profile hidden markov model  analysis allowing the classification of conotoxins that may be only distantly related to well-established conopeptide groups. conosorter also reports key sequence characteristics  and automatically searches the conoserver database for known precursor sequences, which facilitates clear and precise identification of known and novel conopeptides and their associated families. conosorter allows an investigator to efficiently deal with the thousands of sequences produced by high-throughput sequencing methods in a rapid and accurate manner.

RESULTS
identification and classification of known conopeptides
to assess if conosorter can accurately classify conopeptides into superfamilies and classes we performed two initial control experiments - analysis of the conoserver cone snail toxin database and an analysis of the universal uniprotkb/swiss-prot protein database
 <cit> .

the conoserver database contains  <dig>  entries of complete or partial conopeptide sequences. we employed  <dig> %  of the conoserver entries in the development of our training set, and here sought to assess the accuracy of both the regular expression and phmm approaches described above to hierarchically classify the entire suite of conoserver sequences into superfamily and class. we found that the regular expression analysis was able to classify 100% of well-defined conoserver sequence regions  for which the gene superfamily or class have been previously assigned. this approach also assigned a superfamily to  <dig>  sequences, and a class to  <dig> others, which were not previously classified. conosorter failed to confidently classify a total of only ~ <dig> sequences, all of which are derived from patents and synthetic constructs that contain one or more undetermined amino acids, or are sequences for which supportive data regarding their classification are unavailable or have been predicted with an unknown level of accuracy.

analysis of the conoserver entries with phmms showed true positive recognition rates of  <dig> % for superfamily , and  <dig> % for class  using the hmmer hmmscan script with the default e-value cutoff at  <dig>  this approach was also able to confidently assign  <dig>  sequences into superfamilies and  <dig> into classes, which had previously lacked annotation.

in the second experiment, the ability of conosorter to distinguish between conus peptide toxins and other proteins from various organisms has been assessed by screening the entire uniprotkb/swiss-prot database. using the version released on june  <dig> we examined a total of  <dig>  protein sequences isolated from  <dig>  cellular and non-cellular species. table 
 <dig> reports the specificity s calculated at  <dig> e-value cutoffs  according to the following equation:

 s=truenegativestruenegatives+falsepositives 

where true negatives = n – true positives , and false positives = the number of non-conus species matches plus the number of non-conopeptides conus matches.

the species specificity, s , of the conopeptide models has been assessed on uniprotkb/swiss-prot database  at different total e-value thresholds. percentages of specificity and false positive rates  are reported for the classification by gene superfamily, and by class.

at all e-value thresholds conosorter was able to confidently identify and classify conopeptides . of the  <dig>  amino acid sequences referenced in the uniprotkb/swiss-prot database, conosorter, using an e-value of 10- <dig>  was able to classify  <dig> peptide toxins from the genus conus with an annotated superfamily  with only  <dig> false positives  isolated from other organisms. similarly, conosorter was able to classify  <dig> conopeptides with an annotated class  with only  <dig> false positives .

analysis of conus marmoreus venom duct transcriptome
the results presented above indicate that conosorter is capable of identifying conopeptides at high specificity and sensitivity, and, even when the dataset being analyzed ostensibly includes all known proteins, accurately assigning the appropriate superfamily and class. we next sought to use conosorter’s regular expression and phmms searches to ascertain if it was possible to identify novel conopeptides, superfamilies and classes in a previously interrogated rna-seq dataset.

dutertre et al. have recently performed an analysis of the c. marmoreus venom duct transcriptome, which principally relied on serial blast homology searches
 <cit> . they reported  <dig> full conopeptides precursor sequences  that had been previously characterized in this species. a total of  <dig> novel conopeptides were also identified which were assigned to  <dig> known gene superfamilies. thirteen of these were classified, based on the high conservation of their signal sequences, into  <dig> new superfamilies dubbed b <dig>  e, f, h, and n.

we re-examined this medium-throughput  <dig> sequencing data  with conosorter, and identified  <dig> , <dig> putative precursor protein sequences derived from all possible translations of these sequences into six reading frames , which were analyzed hierarchically using the regular expressions and phmms described above to assign sequences to superfamily, class or 'unknown’. this led to the identification of 72%  of annotated complete conus marmoreus precursor conopeptides, including all but two of the sequences found in the previous manual analysis . moreover,  <dig> novel isoforms of known conus marmoreus precursor conopeptides  were identified and assigned the correct superfamily or class based on the signal, pro-, and mature regions. these conopeptides were confirmed by a tandem mass spectrometry  analysis of the milked venom, in which we were able to identify their corresponding mature sequences .

conosorter was also able to assign known gene superfamilies to  <dig> novel full-length precursor conopeptides . using the c. marmoreus milked venom mass spectrometry data, and employing the methods dutertre et al. used to match the ms data to putative novel conopeptides 
 <cit> , we were able to validate protein fragments of  <dig> of the novel conopeptide precursors . milked venom almost exclusively contains mature peptide toxins, which was reflected in the coverage of the mature peptide fragments compared to the full-length precursor conopeptide sequences .
4: table s <dig> 

conosorter also identified  <dig> additional precursor conopeptides which, despite showing conserved amino acids and high hydrophobicity in the signal region, could not be classified into known superfamilies . among these new precursors,  <dig> peptide fragments were identified in milked venom ms data . based on their conservation, and their similarities with known superfamilies, we propose classifying these  <dig> precursor conopeptides into  <dig> new gene superfamilies - h <dig>  i <dig>  m <dig>  n <dig>  o <dig>  q, r, u, w, x, y <dig>  y <dig>  and z. the names of these new groups have been taken from  the  <dig> available letters of the alphabet used to name the currently known superfamilies – q, r, u, w, x, z, or  the names of the superfamily which they are the most similar to, and from which a number has been appended. for example, h <dig> is 40% similar to superfamily h . the signal sequences of these  <dig> new groups of conopeptides show high intrinsic identity rates from  <dig> % to 100% . in addition, we find that the integration of these new distinct and well-defined superfamilies in the current classification does not interfere with the established superfamily classifications - for example, identity rates are as low as  <dig> % between the new w group and the empirical i <dig> superfamily . conosorter also assigned non-conotoxin classes to  <dig> conomarphin and  <dig> contryphan precursor sequences .

discussion
many studies have reported the existence of intraspecific variations in the venom content of distinct conus individuals belonging to the same species
 <cit> . reanalysis of the venom gland transcriptome of one conus marmoreus individual revealed that conosorter was able to identify 72% of the annotated and complete known precursor conopeptides previously isolated in this species, and also led to the discovery of  <dig> new precursor conopeptides,  <dig> % of which were validated in a matched ms/ms dataset. interestingly, we observed that the overall number of c. marmoreus precursor conopeptides found to date is comparable to the number conus species can theoretically produce
 <cit> . further investigation of the novel sequences identified by conosorter also allowed us to define  <dig> new superfamilies of conopeptides, which we have classified as h <dig>  i <dig>  m <dig>  n <dig>  o <dig>  q, r, u, w, x, y <dig>  y <dig>  and z based on their intraspecific conservation rates and identity to established superfamilies. we note that in all new precursor sequences we were able to detect putative pro-peptide cleavage sites , located just before the mature regions, an observation that is consistent with mass spectrometry data and supports the reliability of the matching between the venom duct transcriptome and the proteome of milked venom.

in this reanalysis we were able to retrieve  <dig> of the  <dig> known conus marmoreus precursor sequences. a manual investigation of the  <dig> conopeptide sequences conosorter failed to identify in this analysis and the  <dig> rna-seq data, revealed two likely sources of error:   <dig> sequencing errors, particularly those associated with homopolymers , and  lack of congruence between the rna-seq data read length and the length of the encoded conopeptides. indeed, although conopeptide precursors are relatively short polypeptides, their average length is nonetheless ~ <dig> amino acids , there are those, including calmkll- <dig> and - <dig> conotoxin precursors from conus californicus, that are  <dig> amino acids in length. the average length of a high quality rna-seq read in this dataset was  <dig>  bases, indicating that failure to detect known conotoxins could be improved with longer reads. we suspect that further work in this field will take advantage of platforms offering up to  <dig> ×  <dig> bp nucleotide reads, which not only allow for improved detection of conotoxins but may also facilitate de novo assembly of the conus transcriptome.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article we present conosorter, a high-throughput standalone program that implements regular expressions and phmms for large-scale identification and classification of precursor conopeptides into gene superfamilies and classes based on the er signal, pro-, and mature conopeptide regions generated from raw next-generation transcriptomic or proteomic data. conosorter also generates a set of relevant additional information - frequency of protein sequences, length, number of cysteine residues, hydrophobicity rate of n-terminal region, similarity to known conopeptides - that allows the user to assess the reliability and relevance of the results and aids the identification of new conopeptide superfamilies and classes.

when applied to conoserver and uniprotkb/swiss-prot databases, conosorter is able to recognize 100% of known conotoxin superfamilies and classes with a minimum species specificity of 99%. we also performed a reanalysis of conus marmoreus venom duct transcriptome and  correctly classified all sequences previously annotated,  retrieved  <dig> of the  <dig> precursor conopeptides known in this species,  assigned the correct classification to  <dig> novel precursor toxin isoforms,  identified  <dig> novel precursor conopeptide transcripts,  <dig> of which were confirmed by protein mass spectrometry, and  identified another  <dig> novel conotoxin gene superfamilies called here h <dig>  i <dig>  m <dig>  n <dig>  o <dig>  q, r, u, w, x, y <dig>  y <dig>  and z.

overall, conosorter provides a fully automated, accurate and easy-to-use tool for the analysis of large quantities of transcriptomic or proteomic data of conopeptide sequences, which could contribute to the acceleration of the discovery of new bioactive molecules.
