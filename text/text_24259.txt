BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is an infectious bacterial disease, caused primarily by mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . one third of the world's population is currently infected with tb bacillus. in many countries, immunization of infants with bacillus calmette-guérin vaccine  protects against tb meningitis and other severe forms of tb in children less than five years of age http://www.who.int/en/. however, bcg vaccination is not recommended for adults because the protection provided is variable  <cit> . the threat to human health presented by tb worldwide is increased by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains and co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus  <cit> . therefore, it is crucial to develop novel strategies to improve the bcg vaccine or to develop effective drugs to reduce the socioeconomic and health burden associated with tb.

membrane proteins play important roles in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cell metabolism, ion transport and signal transduction  <cit> . membrane proteins are represented by around 30% of the genome and constitute approximately 70% of all pharmaceutical drug targets  <cit> . traditional one-dimensional electrophoresis  and two-dimensional electrophoresis  coupled with ms are commonly used to study membrane proteome  <cit> . however, solubility and low abundance issues of membrane proteins remain to be the main challenges in gel electrophoresis  <cit> . large-scale identification of m. tuberculosis membrane proteins came forth since  <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig>  mattow et al. carried out membrane subproteomic analysis on m. bovis bcg copenhagen by 1-d sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and 2-de and obtained  <dig> unique proteins including  <dig> proteins harboring 1- <dig> predicted tmhs  <cit> . in  <dig>  målen et al. identified  <dig> proteins by a combination of both gel-based and gel-free protein and peptide fractionation methods, including  <dig> integral membrane proteins with at least one predicted transmembrane region  <cit> . recently, they also separated hydrophobic membrane and membrane-associated proteins directly from sonicated m. tuberculosis h37rv using sds page and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry   <cit> .

in general, proteins rarely function completely independently, which makes identification of protein-protein interactions crucial to our understanding of numerous cellular processes  <cit> . a range of proteomic approaches have been adopted to analyze diverse protein interactions  <cit> . blue native  page, a specialized type of native electrophoresis, is widely applied to investigate protein-protein interactions, especially for membrane proteins  <cit> . bn page was first described in  <dig> for the separation of membrane protein complexes from the respiratory chain of human mitochondria  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that multiprotein membrane complexes can be resolved into individual blue bands in 1-d by bn page, and the protein subunits of each complex can then be separated by various types of gel electrophoresis in 2-d, for example, sds page, doubled sds page  or ief/sds 3-d page  <cit> . however, identification of the stained protein spots in 2-d page by ms analysis is tedious and time-consuming, despite recent advances in automation  <cit> . furthermore, artifactual methionine oxidation that occurrs during sds page cannot be entirely prevented, which is a problem when attempting to identify physiological oxidative modifications of complexes  <cit> . in  <dig>  babusiak et al. presented a novel native 2-d separation technique that combined native electrophoresis with native lc and could be applied to the separation and identification of intact heme-binding protein complexes in murine erythroleukemia cells  <cit> . the feasibility of this approach was also illustrated by fandino et al. who combined bn page and non-gel shotgun methods  <cit> . wessels et al. extended this method to analyze full length of 1-d bn gel lanes and identified potentially interacting proteins by protein correlation profiling   <cit> . since these methods are fully compatible with ms/ms protein identification, they could be widely applied in the study of membrane protein complexes.

studies on a variety of membrane protein complexes have been reported, however, little is known about mycobacterial membrane complexes. here we investigated m. bovis var bcg nctc  <dig>  an attenuated derivative of m. bovis, by an approach coupling bn page to lc-ms/ms to analyze potential protein-protein interactions in membrane fractions. all proteins identified in 1-d bn bands were confirmed using 2-d gel. we have obtained a profile of the m. bovis bcg potential membrane and membrane-associated protein complexes, and these results may provide some insights into bcg protein interaction studies.

RESULTS
sample pre-treatments for bn page
the aim of this work is to isolate and characterize native and structurally intact membrane protein complexes directly from bcg membrane fractions. the protein complex stability during the sample preparation and separation is an extremely important factor in effective identification. it has been demonstrated that some detergents allow for effective solubilization of proteins in oligomeric state, maintenance of enzyme activity and sharp resolution in electrophoresis  <cit> . mild non-ionic detergents, triton x- <dig> and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside , were chosen to solubilize membrane fractions and the effect of different concentrations of detergents was tested experimentally. briefly, two samples of the extracted membrane fractions  were treated with 2%  triton x- <dig> to a final concentration of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, while another two samples were resolved with ddm to a final concentration of 2% and 1% , respectively. the migration of each sample treated with different detergents and concentrations was compared and the best result was obtained with  <dig> %  of triton x- <dig> . this concentration appeared to represent a good compromise, avoiding both the partial disintegration of native complexes caused by excess detergent, and the appearance of gel band smearing due to insufficient concentrations of detergent.

separation by bn page and sds page
in the present study, biological membranes were solubilized with  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> and separation by bn page. according to their size, proteins migrated more slowly with increased running distance and decreased pore size of the gradient gel and stopped almost entirely when they approached their size-dependent specific pore-size limit  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a representative bn page map of membrane fractions. to determine the protein composition in bn gel bands, nine bands with high staining intensity were excised and the peptide mixtures derived from them were individually subjected to lc-ms/ms system as described in the experimental procedures. finally, proteins were identified by database search and replicate measurements have confirmed the identity of these protein hits.

the result showed that each bn band represented a protein complex. totally, nine potential multiprotein complexes were obtained. the blue band i and band vii contained some subunits of lipid metabolism complex, whereas the sharp band ii was identified as atp synthase. in band iii and iv, two members of phenolpthiocerol synthase and three of emb protein complex were found, respectively. in band v two polyketide synthases were recognized, whereas band vi contained four members of heat shock protein family. in addition, several members of polyribosomal proteins were found in band viii. in the last band ix, two subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase  enzyme complex were identified.

in  <dig>  målen et al. obtained a comprehensive picture of the m.bovis bcg membrane protein repertoire  <cit> . of these proteins identified in their study, four protein complexes were found, including atp synthase, nad transhydrogenase, ubiquinone oxidoreductase and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. in detail, the soluble protein encoded by the pntaa gene has been shown to be associated with two other proteins encoded by pntab and pntb genes, forming nad transhydrogenases complex on the membrane. additionally, six subunits of the atp synthase complex, five subunits of the ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex and three subunits of the cytochrome bc <dig> complex were also identified, respectively.

in the present study, to confirm the protein composition of each complex, nine bands which cut out from 1-d bn gel were resolved into their individual subunits by denaturing sds page. the subunits of each complex were ordered according to their molecular weight in vertical rows. figure  <dig> showed a 2-d page map of protein complexes identified in bn gel bands and  <dig> spots were recognizable on the map. in total,  <dig> distinct proteins were identified by two or more peptide hits using the mascot algorithms. a complete list of all identified proteins is provided in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  on average, the identified proteins matched with more than six unique peptides. of these proteins,  <dig> proteins had at least one transmembrane helix  predicted by tmhmm  <dig>  . the average gravy value, which is used to evaluate the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along with its amino acid sequence, was  <dig>  for integral membrane proteins   <cit> . based on the pasteur institute functional classification tree, the identified proteins were distributed across several functional groups . most of the identified proteins were involved in intermediary metabolism and respiration . additionally, seven proteins  were required for lipid metabolism , information pathways  and cell wall and cell processes , respectively. it was interesting that some proteins with high hydrophobicity involved in complexes were identified in our study, for example, embc, emba and embb, which contained  <dig> tmhs. therefore, our method may offer an effective alternative strategy to identify proteins with high hydrophobicity or multiple tmhs in complex. to investigate the potential protein complexes, the molecular composition and function of the proteins were analyzed as discussed below.

analysis of potential membrane and membrane-associated protein complexes
lipid metabolism complex
in bn gel, one band migrated sharply in the upper part of the gradient gel. in this band, we identified mmpl <dig> and the polyketide synthase pks <dig>  along with the proteins papa <dig>  fadd <dig> and bcg_3890c. in 2-d gel this bn gel band was resolved into five proteins . spot number  <dig> migrated with an apparent molecular mass of about  <dig> kda and was identified as polyketide synthase. spot  <dig> was identified as integral membrane transport protein . in addition, a fatty-acid-coa ligase , a polyketide synthase associated protein  and a putative transposase  were also found in 2-d gel. genome analysis reveals that the mmpl <dig> gene is positioned  <dig> kbp downstream from the pks <dig> gene, and the papa <dig> gene is also linked to the pks <dig> gene . the co-localization of the mmpl gene with genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis  and lipid metabolism , suggests a similar role of these proteins in complex lipid transport in mycobacteria  <cit> . sequence analysis reveals mmpl <dig> protein comprises  <dig> amino acid residues and is predicted to contain  <dig> membrane-spanning alpha helices. the papa <dig> protein matched with four unique peptides and was a suspected membrane-associated acyltransferase, suggesting its involvement in the esterification of trehalose with methyl-branched fatty acids during the biosynthesis of polyacyltrehalose and sl- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, fadd <dig> can combine with the protein encoded by pks gene in various ways to form complex hybrid metabolites  <cit> .

this is also the case with mmpl <dig>  which is closely related to bcg_0241c and bcg_0238c . in 2-d gel, three proteins were unambiguous identified . these encoding genes occur within the same apparent gene cluster, which is conserved in all of the mycobacterial genomes sequenced to date and found to play a possible fundamental role in mycobacterial pathogenicity  <cit> . since proteins mmpl <dig> and mmpl <dig> may be involved in the transportation of molecules that function in host-pathogen interactions, inhibitors of mmpl <dig> or mmpl <dig> may provide novel drug targets in the future.

atp synthase complex
gel band ii comprised  <dig> proteins, as measured by lc ms/ms, including four imps. all members of atp synthase complex were identified from this band. resolution of the band on the 2-d gel revealed eight subunits of atp synthase were obtained. in detail, subunit a , which contained five transmembrane helices, matched with two unique peptides. subunit b , which embedded in the membrane and contained a long helical domain extending into the cytoplasm, was in contact with subunit a, and subunit c  with an apparent molecular mass of about  <dig> kda, which contained two hairpin-like tmhs, was connected by a central sequence that was exposed to the cytoplasm  <cit> . subunit β , which constituted part of the α3β <dig> hexamer, contained  <dig> peptides and the sequence coverage was  <dig> %. additionally, subunits α  and γ  consisted of  <dig> and nine peptides, respectively . subunits δ  and ε  contained nine and five unique peptides, respectively. in our work, although the stoichiometry of the α3β3γ complex could not be determined by ms/ms measurements, the numbers of the identified peptides represented, at least partially, the relative abundance of these subunits . in fact, using the procedure proposed by abresch et al., we were able to estimate the molecular ratios of the subunits  <cit> .

it is a common feature of bn page that minor fractions of multiprotein complexes precipitate during the electrophoretic run. in fact, spot  <dig> on 2-d gel  was identified as putative lipoprotein lpqw. analysis of lipoprotein lpqw with bioinformatic softwares predicted a gravy score of  <dig>  and no transmembrane helices. interestingly, string  <dig>  database analysis predicted that the lpqw protein is a functional partner of integral membrane arabinosyltransferase a  . it seemed that the lpqw protein was a cytoplasmic protein that interacted with the emb protein complex . additionally, the putative esterase  migrated as "free" proteins because of no attachment to other protein subunits using string database analysis. spot  <dig> was identified as chaperone protein , which was a subunit of heat shock protein family . spot  <dig>  aligned with other proteins in band ii, was observed but no identification was obtained by ms analysis.

phenolpthiocerol synthase complex
in band iii on bn gel, we obtained two members of phenolpthiocerol synthase  protein family, which was encoded by a large operon  <cit> . in 2-d gel spot  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as ppsc and ppsa, and they matched with eight and  <dig> unique peptides, respectively. a previous study demonstrated that ppsc was involved in a late step in the biosynthesis of phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol and disruption of ppsc in m. bovis bcg led to be an inability to produce mycoside b and phthiocerol dimycocerosates   <cit> . practically, since the proteins encoded by pps genes are unique to pathogenic mycobacteria, they may be used as targets in the high throughput screening of desperately needed antimycobacterial drugs. additionally, database search after ms/ms analysis of pigmented spot  <dig> did not yield any result.

emb protein complex
bn gel band iv was subjected to in-gel digestion and analyzed by lc-ms/ms. three proteins encoded by emb genes, emba, embb and embc, were identified in this band. in 2-d gel, three spots  were identified as arabinosyltransferases . on the basis of sequence analysis, these proteins are imps with  <dig> tmhs , and match with four, seven and three unique peptides, respectively. functional analysis showed that embc is involved in the synthesis of lipoarabinomannan, and emba and embb are responsible for the polymerization of arabinose into the arabinan of ag  <cit> . they have been proposed to be the main targets of ethambutol . disruption of these proteins would inhibit the formation of the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex and may lead to increased permeability of the cell wall and drug uptake  <cit> . therefore, they may serve as targets for the development of therapeutic approaches against tb.

in this band, a putative membrane alanine rich protein was obtained . analysis of the primary sequence of the protein predicted two transmembrane helices and string database analysis predicted that the protein bcg_2759c was no interaction among those proteins identified in our study. in this way, we were able to conclude that the protein bcg_2759c was a cytoplasmic membrane protein and a "free" protein because of no clear attachment to other protein identified in 2-d gel. in addition, spot  <dig> was identified as subunit a of atp synthase complex .

polyketide synthases
two polyketide synthases , pks <dig> and pks <dig>  were identified in bn band v. genome analysis reveals that pks <dig> and pks <dig> gene are located in a cluster of pks genes. the proteins encoded by these genes are large multifunctional enzymes and belong to the same pks family required for pdim synthesis in mycobacteria  <cit> . in 2-d gel, spot  <dig> migrated with an apparent molecular mass of great than  <dig> kda was identified as pks <dig>  and the protein matched with  <dig> unique peptides. it has been reported that pks <dig> plays an important role in virulence during the persistent phase of infection  <cit> . additionally, pks <dig>  matched with six peptides, and has been implicated in the biosynthesis of monomethyl-branched unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> .

heat shock protein family
heat shock proteins  are involved in a highly conserved family, and first recognized by their upregulated expression in response to host exposure to raised temperatures  <cit> . in the present study, we identified groel <dig>  groel <dig>  dnak, dnaj and fura in gel band vi . in 2-d gel, spots  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as the  <dig> kda chaperonin  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. it has been reported that  <dig> kda chaperonins are one type of molecular chaperones found on the surface of cells and these proteins have high affinity for lipid monolayers and bilayers and can associate with lipid membranes  <cit> . accordingly, it was no great surprise to detect the presence of two  <dig> kda chaperonins  in the membrane fractions.

additionally, dnaj  is a stress gene-encoding protein that is highly conserved among bacterial genera. therefore, gene dnaj is useful not only for identification of mycobacterial species but also for inferring their phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . suzanna et al. found that during the folding of some proteins, dnak  recognized extending polypeptide chains and cooperated with dnaj in stabilizing this intermediate conformation  <cit> . in addition, spot  <dig> was identified as a ferric uptake regulation protein . on the basis of bioinformatics analysis, fura was a cytoplasmic protein and no interaction with hsp family members. thus, the protein migrated as "free" proteins in 2-d gel.

polyribosomal proteins
in general, ribosomes are ribonucleoprotein particles consisting of two subunits, which are designated as the small subunit  and the large subunit  in bacteria  <cit> . ribosomal proteins involved in the subunits are the major components of the polyribosome complex where mrna is translated into protein  <cit> . in this study, seven ribosomal proteins were detected in band viii, including five proteins in the large ribosomal subunit  and two in the small ribosomal subunit . all these proteins identified in bn gel were confirmed using 2-d sds gel. despite the lack of predicted tmhs, some ribosomal proteins are associated with the plasma membrane by imps and may interact transiently with the nascent membrane or secreted proteins  <cit> . it is important to note that some ribosomal proteins can easily dissociate from polyribosomal complex during their preparation and separation.

succinate dehydrogenase complex
members of succinate dehydrogenase  complex were found in band ix. sdh is a membrane-bound protein complex and key enzyme participating in intermediary metabolism and aerobic energy production in bacteria  <cit> . this complex is composed of four subunits sdha/b/c/d. here we were only able to identify two subunits: sdha and sdhb . ms analysis indicated that sdha matched with  <dig> peptides, which was the highest number of unique peptide reported in our study. intriguingly, these two subunits can exhibit sdh activity in the absence of sdhc/d, which are the membrane components  <cit> .

in addition to the proteins discussed above, some spots were observed in 2-d gel but no identifications were found by ms analysis. for example, there were five spots presented in band vi  which showed exogenous stains on 2-d denaturing gel, while no proteins were determined among these spots. the spots without identifications also presented in other bands . this observation may suggest that some pigment molecules can bind to gel without destaining completely.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, by coupling lc-ms/ms to bn page we were able to unambiguously identify potential membrane/membrane-associated protein complexes in bcg membrane fractions. the proteins identified in complexes were confirmed using 2-d gel. for example, eight subunits of atp synthase complex which were obtained in bn gel band were all detected in 2-d gel. furthermore, we were able to identify large, extremely hydrophobic proteins in bn gel by in-gel digestion and ms/ms analysis. in summary, this study is the first to apply the bn page technique to the separation of potential bcg membrane protein complexes. our results may provide some clues for bcg protein interaction studies and designing strategies against bacterial infection.
