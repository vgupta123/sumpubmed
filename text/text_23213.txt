BACKGROUND
gene duplication was first proposed by bridges in  <dig> in a study of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . it was further detailed by ohno in a book, evolution by gene duplication, in  <dig>  <cit> . the ancestor of vertebrates experienced two rounds of whole-genome duplication which may have played a key role in adaptive evolution of vertebrate . the third round of whole-genome duplication that occurred in teleosts is thought to have driven the diversification of teleosts .

oxygen is critical to all aerobic life, particularly for animals living in water, which contains only 1/30th the oxygen of air at the same partial pressure . sophisticated cellular mechanisms have evolved to allow organisms to detect and react to changes in oxygen levels. in these mechanisms, oxygen acts as the terminal electron acceptor in the mitochondrion of metazoans  <cit> . when studying the expression of epo from hep3b cells under hypoxic conditions, semenza and wang  <cit>  identified a nuclear factor bound to the hypoxia-inducible enhancer  of the erythropoietin  gene at a site required for hypoxia activation of transcription. this nuclear factor was named hypoxia-inducible factor . in mammals, hif mediates major changes in gene expression under hypoxic conditions and participates in a series of processes including angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose and iron transport, glycolysis, and cell-cycle control . hif is a heterodimeric transcription factor of the bhlh-pas  family. it consists of an erratic alpha subunit  and a steady beta subunit  . according to studies in caenorhabditis elegans and d. melanogaster, there is only one hif-α in invertebrates, but in vertebrates, there are at least three functional hif-α isoforms: hif-1α, which regulates the acute hypoxic response; hif-2α, which regulates the chronic hypoxic response; and hif-3α, which inhibits the activities of the other two isoforms  <cit> . hif-1α and hif-2α both have two oxygen-dependent degradation domains  that are located in the central region, and two transactivation domains—an inner activation domain  that overlaps with the coddd and a carboxy-terminal activation domain . hif-3α lost the c-tad  <cit> . with adequate oxygen , one or both of the highly conserved prolyl residues located in oddd of hif-α  becomes hydroxylated by the prolyl-4-hydroxylase , and then the hydroxylated hif-α interacts with the von-hippel-lindau tumor suppressor  and recruits ubiquitin ligase, which is consequently degraded by the proteasome  <cit> . however, under hypoxic conditions, hif-α, which is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus via its nuclear localization signal  motif, where it dimerizes with hif-β into hif heterodimer and binds to the core dna motif  in hypoxia-response elements  for transcriptional activation of the target genes  <cit> .

the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication that occurred early in the teleost evolution generated six hif-α genes: 1a/b, 2a/b, and 3a/b, which was followed by the loss of one member of each a/b paralogous pair in most euteleosts but not in cyprinids  <cit> . the schizothoracine fish , which are divided into three groups  according to the differences in their scales, pharyngeal teeth, and barbels, are the endemic and most diverse group of cyprinids distributed in the tibetan plateau and its adjacent areas. the elevation in this area ranges from  <dig> to 5000 m, and the environment is characterized by hypoxia and low temperatures . primitive schizothoracine fish including schizothorax, schizocypris , and aspiorhynchus, are distributed at the edge of the tibetan plateau. specialized schizothoracine fish included diptychus, ptychobarbus, and gymnodiptychus, and highly specialized schizothoracine fish included gymnocypris, oxygymnocypris, schizopygopsis, platypharodon, chuanchia, and herzensteinia. the distribution of specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish is largely limited to the central region of the plateau  <cit> . each group represents specific periods of geological evolution of the tibetan plateau, which ultimately caused the modern distribution pattern of schizothoracine fish, in which primitive, specialized, and highly specialized schizothoracine fish are distribued from the edges to the central part of the plateau   <cit> . previous analyses of the mitochondrial genome have demonstrated that schizothoracine fish, which are teleost fishes, are well-adapted to high altitudes and hypoxia  <cit> . however, hif-α genes, which are related to hypoxia, have been little studied in schizothoracine fish. chi  <cit>  referred to the evolutionary patterns of the hif-α genes in two high-altitude fish, but no signs of adaptive evolution was detected since the species limitation.figure  <dig>

to better understand the relationship between adaptation to hypoxia and hif-α genes in plateau and plains fish, teleost-specific hif-α gene duplications  were cloned and identified in six species of schizothoracinae and in zebrafish. further computational and experimental analyses reveal the mode of evolution and response to hypoxia of these gene paralogs.

RESULTS
characterization of hif-α duplications and phylogenetic analysis
although many studies have focused on hif in cyprinids, duplicated hif-α paralogs have never been identified in schizothoracine fish. the sequences of hif-α paralogs  of the six species of schizothoracinae were obtained here for the first time . the n-terminal of zebrafish hif-1αa sequence was also isolated . the data sets supporting the results of this article are also available in the dryad digital repository  <cit> . the lengths of different hif-α paralogs in schizothoracine fish were found to vary. however, the lengths of specific hif-α genes remained consistent among highly specialized schizothoracine fish, even when the schizothoracine fish came from different genera .

protein analysis showed that hif-α paralogs from schizothoracine fish all contained the main domains, like their mammalian counterparts. the similarity between duplicated hif-1αa and hif-1αb was 52%, and the similarity between duplicated hif-2αa and hif-2αb was 55%. the bhlh-pas domain of hif-αs n-terminal was highly conserved, but the c-terminal was less conserved, especially near the oxygen-dependent proline hydroxylation sites. a deletion, specifically, the conserved proline hydroxylation motif lxxlap, was detected in the nodd domain of hif-1αa in all six schizothoracine fish and zebrafish . currently, hif-1αa was only amplified in cyprinidae, so this deletion might be cyprinidae-specific. sequence alignment suggested that there was a schizothoracine-specific mutation in the codd domain of the hif-1αb of specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish, specifically the proline hydroxylation motif mutated into pxxlap . all deletions and mutations were located in functional odd domains that interacted with phd via the phd-hif oxygen-sensing system  <cit> . this may affect function during biological processes. the targets of phd in mammals are proline  <dig> and proline  <dig> in the odd domain, but pro- <dig> is the primary critical substrate in phd binding to hif-1α  <cit> . it is here speculated that hif-1αb is more likely to change function than other hif-αs are.figure  <dig>

the chordate phylogenetic tree of hif-1α and hif-2α genes was reconstructed using the mrbayes and raxml softwares with sea squirt and amphioxus hif-α sequences as the outgroups  <cit> . the two computer programs inferred similar tree topologies. the bayesian posterior probability values and maximum likelihood bootstrap values were high . the topology was largely consistent with that found in previous studies  <cit> . however, the phylogeny estimated for the hif-1α gene was inconsistent with the recently published hif-1α phylogenies based on the phylobayes  <cit>  and raxml softwares  <cit> . recent results indicated a sister relationship between hif-1αa and hif-1αb, our results indicate instead that hif-1αb might be more similar to the ancient hif-1α than hif-1αa is. massey et al.  <cit>  and roje  <cit>  have researched on the effects of non-neutral gene on phylogeny. in this study, more hif-1αb sequences were used than any other studies, which might have led to a non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio  distinct from that obtained in previous studies. the phylogeny  in the schizothoracine fish constructed using concatenated hif-1α and hif-2α sequences agrees with that using mitochondrial cytochrome b  <cit> . for this reason, it was considered suitable for use in the following selection pressures analysis.figure  <dig>

molecular evolution of the teleostei hif-α duplicate
first, standard branch-site models in paml  <cit>  were used to assess the different selective pressures experienced by the protein coding sequences of each hif-α paralogous pair. in this model, the foreground branches are the branches tested for positive selection, and the background branches are all other branches on the tree  <cit> . in the likelihood ratio test , branch-site model a is the alternative model allowing ω <dig> to vary among codons, while the simpler null model is model a but with ω2 =  <dig> fixed  <cit> . in this study, three methods were used to specify the foreground branches. according to the lrt of branch-site models, for hif-1αb, when the clade of all schizothoracine fish was specified as the foreground branches, the likelihood obtained under model a was not significantly higher than that obtained under the null hypothesis of no positive selection; but when the clade of specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish was specified as the foreground branches, the likelihood obtained under model a was significantly higher than that of the null model  and ω >  <dig> . when only the clade of highly specialized schizothoracine fish was specified as the foreground branches, the likelihood obtained under model a was quite significantly higher than that of the null model  and ω >  <dig>  . the posterior probability of sites that had undergone positive selection was calculated using the bayes empirical bayes  method in model a. for these last two analyses, there were  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid sites in hif-1αb sequences with a posterior probability greater than  <dig> . in the second method, the amino acid sites at position  <dig>  had a posterior probability  <dig>  as indicated by beb, which was significant at the 1% level, but in the third method, the amino acid sites at position  <dig> and  <dig> had a posterior probability  <dig>  and  <dig>  as indicated by beb, which was significant at the 5% level. in this way, they were identified as crucial amino acid sites that had experienced positive selection. three of the  <dig> sites and  <dig> of the  <dig> sites were located in the odd domain by the last two methods. for hif-1αa, hif-2αa, and hif-2αb, no other positively selected site was detected.table  <dig>

secondly, stochastic branch-site models in fitmodel  <cit>  were used to detect the different selective pressures experienced on the protein coding sequences of hif-1α and hif-2α, respectively. for hif-1α, the likelihood obtained under m3 + s <dig>  model was significantly higher than that obtained under null  model with ω2 >  <dig> and 2Δlnl =  <dig>  . however, there were only  <dig> amino acid sites  with a posterior probability >  <dig> . for hif-2α, no other positively selected site was detected.

in standard branch-site models, although the foreground branches specified for hif-1αb were different, the last two methods showed similar positively selected sites with different levels of significance. with stochastic branch-site models, positive selection was also detected in hif-1αa and hif-1αb. it is here hypothesized that the hif-1αb experienced strong selective pressure, which may have led to changes in function. the higher the altitude at which the schizothoracine fish were distributed, the more significant the selective pressure was. this may be one of the mechanisms by which schizothoracine fish have adapted to the high altitudes of the tibetan plateau.

expression and hypoxic regulation of different hif-α paralogs in hek 293 t cells
rytkönen  <cit>  showed that the transcription of hif-1α decreased after hypoxic insult in adult zebrafish, but the transcription of hif-2αa remained stable and hif-2αb transcription increased significantly. to determine whether changes in oxygen tension regulate hif-α at the protein level, hek 293 t cells were transfected with either the indicated myc-tagged hif-α constructs or an empty vector, and cells were subjected to 18 h of hypoxic treatment after 6 h of normoxic cultivation. western blot analysis indicated that all the fish hif-αs could be expressed in hek 293 t cells. compared to the normoxic condition, there were only rarely significant increases in levels of protein expression under hypoxic conditions: hif-1αa and hif-1αb in d. rerio, hif-1αb in gd. pachycheilus and hif-2αa of g. eckloni . generally, the expression level of hif-1α was greater than that of hif-2α after hypoxic treatment and under normoxic conditions .figure  <dig> 
expression of hif-α in hek 293 t cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. n: normoxia, h: hypoxia. there was no significant different in protein expression levels under hypoxic and normoxic conditons, excepting that there was more expression of hif-1αa and hif-1αb of d. rerio, hif-1αb of gd. pachycheilus and hif-2αa of g. eckloni under hypoxic conditions.



to determine whether selective pressure could have affected the transcriptional activity of hif-α toward their common targets, empty vector  and the indicated myc-tagged hif-α constructs were co-transfected with the hre-luciferase reporter and ptk-renilla luciferase in hek 293 t cells. each hif-1α and hif-2α was found to upregulate luciferase activity under normoxic conditions . this indicated that the function of fish hif-αs had been conserved. in addition, hif-1αb showed more luciferase activity than other hif-αs, even under normoxic conditions, suggesting that hif-1αb protein may be more stable. the transcriptional activity of hif-2α was obvious under normoxic conditions but not detectable under hypoxic conditions.figure  <dig>

discussion
fish possess homologs of hif-α and hif-β that share strong similarity with those of humans. they may play roles similar to those of their mammalian counterparts in expression of oxgen-dependent genes  <cit> . the sequence of hif-α gene had been extensively characterized in fishes. the first fish hif-α gene was identified in rainbow trout  in  <dig>  <cit> . the sequence was slightly shorter than that of mammals. it included bhlh-pas and odd domains and proline and asparagine residues, which were relatively conserved in the deduced rainbow trout hif-α protein. subsequently, hif-α gene was reported from killfish , grass carp , crucian carp , zebrafish , atlantic croaker , asp , three-spined stickleback , russian sturgeon , naked carp , wuchang bream , chinese sucker , bighead carp , silver carp , prenant’s schizothoracin , namucuo naked carp , and so on .

although previous studies identified hif-α in schizothoracine fish, the present study is the first to identify teleost-specific duplicated hif-α paralogs. it not only provides new information for hif research in teleosts but also supplies a foundation for further study of the adaptation of schizothoracine fish to high altitudes and low oxygen levels in the tibetan plateau. each schizothoracine fish hif-α was smaller than the corresponding human hif-α. the hif-1αa/b and hif-2αa/b of schizothoracine fish shared more than  <dig> and 53% similarity with human hif-1α and hif-2α, respectively. hif-1αb and hif-2αb shared more sequence identities with human hif-1α and hif-2α than hif-1αa and hif-2αa did in all species except gd. pachycheilus. the bhlh-pas domain of hif-αs n-terminal was highly conserved, but the odd domain of the c-terminal was less conserved, especially in regions in the vicinity of the oxygen-dependent proline hydroxylation sites. a cyprinidae-specific deletion  in the nodd domain of hif-1αa may have occurred in all six schizothoracine fish, and a schizothoracine-specific mutation lxxlap mutated to pxxlap in the codd domain of the specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish hif-1αb. the hif hydroxylase pathway was regulated by the phd family of oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases in metazoans  <cit> . in mammals, the pro- <dig> in the codd domain is the primary critical substrate in phd binding to hif-1α  <cit> . it was here deduced that although the deletion and mutation were all located in the odd domain, the change in the codd domain of hif-1αb was more important than the deletion in the nodd domain of hif-1αa was in the evolution of schizothoracine fish.

the hif pathway plays a pivotal role in the response to hypoxia, and the phd family of oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylases plays a critical role in regulating hif stability  <cit> . some candidate genes associated with the hif pathway showed signals of positive selection in species living in the tibetan plateau. for instance, epas <dig> , egln <dig>  and ppara were detected in tibetans  <cit> ; adam <dig> in the yak  <cit> ; adora2a, ccl <dig>  eng, pik3c2a, pklr, atp12a, and nos <dig> in the tibetan antelope  <cit> ; srf, txnrd <dig>  and wnt7b in the ground tit  <cit> ; and epas <dig>  sirt <dig>  plxna <dig>  and mafg in the tibetan mastiff  <cit> . in this study, computational estimation suggested that the specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish hif-1αb have experienced significantly selective pressure. positively selected sites were detected in hif-1α, hif-2α, and hif-2α, respectively in schizothoracine fish, tibetans, and tibetan mastiff. this shows that fish and mammals developed different mechanisms for adapting to the special environment of the tibetan plateau.

functional analysis was performed by transfecting schizothoracine fish hif-α in hek 293 t cells. results showed that the expression level of hif-1α differed from that of hif-2α. hypoxia was found to increase the abundance of hif-1αa/b but not that of hif-2αa/b. the decrease in the protein levels of hif-2αa/b may be attributable to the combined impact of the reduced protein synthesis under hypoxic conditions and the rapid folding rate of hif-α protein in mammalian cells  <cit> . the luciferase assay showed that all the hif-αs characterized in this study were capable of forming functional heterodimers with human hif-β and could activate hre reporter gene, but they performed different levels of oxygen-dependent regulation. each hif-α  was able to upregulate luciferase activity under normoxic conditions, and hif-1αb was more significant, suggesting that hif-1αb was more stable under normoxic conditions. the transcriptional activity of hif-1αb was higher than that of other hif-1αs under hypoxic conditions, and transcriptional activity was stronger under hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. these results were also supported by structural analysis. for hif-1αb, the bhlh-pas domain, which is responsible for heterodimerization with hif-β and dna binding, was conserved; and the odd domain, which interacts with phd, was mutated  <cit> . it was also discovered that hif-2αa/b downregulated luciferase activity under hypoxic conditions. this was consistent with the decrease observed in protein levels of hif-2αa/b after hypoxia treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
the teleost-specific duplicated hif-α paralogs, hif-1αa, hif-1αb, hif-2αa, and hif-2αb, were successfully identified in schizothoracine fish. each deduced hif-α was found to have the same principal domains as its mammalian counterparts, and had evolved specialized roles in the response to hypoxia. it is here postulated that hif-1αb may be the most important regulator in the adaptation of schizothoracine fish to the environment of the tibetan plateau. although sequence variation and significant selective pressure were detected in hif-1αb of the specialized and highly specialized schizothoracine fish, transcriptional activity showed no significant difference between plateau fish  and plains fish . this might be because zebrafish are also hypoxia tolerant fish  <cit> . further studies are needed to explore the structure and functions of schizothoracine fish hif-αs and to determine their roles in the mechanism underlying the response to hypoxic conditions. the adaptation to tibetan plateau of schizothoracine fish involves a complicated evolutionary mechanism, which is affected by a cluster of genes. in the future, research on transcriptome and genome of schizothoracine fish may contribute to explain the mechanism of their adaption to tibetan plateau.
