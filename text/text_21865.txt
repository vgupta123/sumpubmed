BACKGROUND
integrin family receptors mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. integrins are heterodimers consisting of an α and a β subunit. at least  <dig> α and  <dig> β chains are known to date, which combine to  <dig> integrin receptors  <cit> . most receptors recognize more than one ligand and each ligand is capable of binding several integrins, which leads to a wide variety of possible interactions  <cit> . many β <dig> and β <dig> integrins are receptors for extracellular matrix molecules mediating not only adhesion of cells but also conveying signals which affect cytoskeletal architecture and thus cell morphology and differentiation : in renal cells, signaling via integrins can alter the expression of cytoskeletal proteins  <cit>  and the arrangement of cytoskeletal components, which is mediated via integrin linked kinase  <cit> . several studies have suggested a regulatory role for integrins in the differentiation of epithelial cells  <cit> , podocytes  <cit> , mesangial cells  <cit>  or fibroblasts  <cit> . moreover, integrin signaling is involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a phenomenon frequently seen in models of renal fibrotic disease  <cit> .

the α <dig> integrin chain is expressed predominantly on mesenchymal cells, like vascular smooth muscle cells, certain fibroblast cells and glomerular mesangial cells, where it serves as a receptor for fibronectin, vitronectin, tenascin-c fragments, osteopontin and nephronectin, but not for collagens  <cit> . moreover, a role for α8β <dig> integrin in migration, proliferation and survival of cells was described  <cit> .

a few studies suggested that α <dig> integrin may be involved in cell differentiation processes: α <dig> integrin expression was reported to contribute to the maintenance of the smooth muscle cell differentiated phenotype, because downregulation of α <dig> integrin led to a severe reduction of α-smooth muscle actin expression and an increase in cell motility  <cit> , while overexpression of α <dig> integrin had the opposite effects  <cit> . in fibroblasts, the downregulation of α <dig> integrin resulted in epithelialization, possibly due to induced wt- <dig> expression  <cit> .

a role for a <dig> integrin was suggested in atherosclerotic  <cit>  and fibrotic diseases  <cit> . changes in the cytoskeletal architecture of cells could influence their ability to adhere and migrate. this might have an important impact on the progression of atherosclerotic or fibrotic diseases. on the other hand, we did not observe alterations of the smooth muscle cell layers of renal arteries and arterioles in α <dig> integrin-deficient mice, whereas the glomerular mesangium of these mice was clearly abnormal  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that mesangial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells might be differently affected by a lack of α <dig> integrin. we investigated if the properties of mesangial and vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from α <dig> integrin-deficient mice differ from their respective counterparts cultured from wild type controls.

RESULTS
cultivated wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient mouse mesangial cells  were tested for mrna and protein expression of α <dig> integrin to confirm lack of α <dig> integrin expression in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs and presence of α <dig> integrin in wild type cells. α <dig> integrin mrna expression was readily detected in wild type mcs by real-time rt-pcr , while α <dig> integrin mrna expression was within background detection in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs . a <dig> integrin protein was detected in wild type mcs, but not in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs by western blot analysis .

wild type mcs in culture grew in a typical mesenchymal pattern , while the morphology of α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs was different with a more compact cell shape lacking long protrusions. moreover, α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs were arranged in groups forming cell islets . f-actin fibers were frequently arranged parallel to the cytoplasma membrane in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs , while in wild type mcs f-actin fibers were spanning the whole cell more irregularily  after an attachment time of  <dig> hours. focal contacts were shorter in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs compared to wild type mcs and frequently arranged in bundles . mrna expression of α-smooth muscle actin was clearly detectable in wild type mcs but downregulated in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs almost to background levels . α-smooth muscle actin protein was barely detectable by western blot analysis in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs . while wild type mcs α-smooth muscle actin stain was arranged in typical stress fibers, most α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs stained negative for α-smooth muscle actin, except for some occasional staining in short cortical fibers along the plasma membrane . double staining for α-smooth muscle actin and f-actin confirmed that in wild type mcs α-smooth muscle actin is a component of stress fibers . in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs f-actin staining is preserved despite the lack of α-smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity, arguing for a contribution of other types of actin to f-actin-positive fibers .

in contrast to mcs, vascular smooth muscle cells  downregulate α <dig> integrin expression after cell passaging in culture. in freshly isolated vsmcs of passage  <dig>  α <dig> integrin expression was readily detectable by real-time rt-pcr, while in vsmcs after  <dig> passages, α <dig> integrin became nearly undetectable . for this reason, we only used freshly isolated vsmcs in passage  <dig> for our further experiments. lack of α <dig> integrin expression in α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr  and western blot analysis .

in contrast to our findings in mcs, cell morphology was not different in wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs . moreover, the distribution of f-actin fibers was not different in α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs compared to wild type vsmcs  after  <dig> hours of attachment. adherent α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs developed focal contacts, which were comparable to the focal contacts of wild type vsmcs .

evaluation of α-smooth muscle actin expression revealed no significant differences between wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs . western blot analysis revealed that α-smooth muscle actin protein was abundant in wild type as well as α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs . α-smooth muscle actin fibers were spanning the whole cell and were not reduced in α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs compared to wild types .

as reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton can lead to changes in the expression of connective tissue growth factor , we assessed protein expression levels of ctgf in wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs in comparison to vsmcs. in mcs, a lack of α <dig> integrin resulted in downregulation of the protein expression of ctgf , while in α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs ctgf expression was not reduced .

we hypothesized that the differences in the effects of the lack of α <dig> integrin on cytoskeletal organization observed in mcs and vsmcs could be a consequence of a different regulation of other integrins in both cell types. therefore, we compared expression patterns of several integrins in α <dig> integrin-deficient cells and wild type cells. in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs, induction of integrin chains α <dig>  and even more prominently of α <dig> and α <dig>  was detected when compared to wild type mcs . in contrast, none of the investigated integrin chains was induced in α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs .

we then hypothesized that mcs lacking α <dig> integrin might downregulate not only α-smooth muscle actin but also additional mesenchymal markers. to analyze expression patterns of other mesenchymal markers, we performed real-time rt-pcr for vimentin and desmin and for the epithelial marker e-cadherin, because α <dig> integrins are known to upregulate e-cadherin-mediated adhesion  <cit> . in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs the expression of desmin was significantly lower than in wild type mcs , while in α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs desmin expression was not significantly different from desmin expression in wild type vsmcs . on the other hand, vimentin expression was not affected by the lack of α <dig> integrin, in none of the cell types . e-cadherin expression was barely above detection level in both wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs, compared to its expression in liver cells used as positive control . in vsmcs, expression of e-cadherin was not different in wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient cells .

to clarify if these differences of the properties of α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs and vsmcs have functional consequences, we performed proliferation assays. our results show that α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs and vsmcs differ in their growth response to fetal calf serum when grown on fibronectin, a ligand for α <dig> integrin . while stimulation of α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs leads to significantly more proliferation than stimulation of wild type mcs, proliferation of wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs was not different.

discussion
taken together, a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs differed from wild type mcs with regard to morphology, cytoskeletal architecture and proliferative capacity, while a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs did not differ from wild type vsmcs. this is in keeping with our previous in vivo findings suggesting changes in the glomerular mesangium but not in the media of renal arteries in a <dig> integrin-deficient mice  <cit> , although in normal mice both structures contain mesenchymal cells expressing a <dig> integrin. a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs downregulated expression of a-smooth muscle actin and desmin, but not vimentin, while expression of these mesenchymal proteins was not altered in a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs. a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs had higher expression levels of integrin chains a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> compared to wild type mcs. similar differences were not detected between a <dig> integrin-deficient and wild type vsmcs. moreover, increased proliferation rates due to a lack of a <dig> integrin were only detected in mcs, not in vsmcs.

several studies show that integrins can contribute to cell differentiation and to the maintenance of the phenotype of the cell via outside-in signaling from the surrounding matrix to the cytoskeleton and small adapter molecules inside the cell  <cit> . many integrins use a signaling pathway involving the β <dig> integrin chain and integrin linked kinase to regulate the cytoskeletal architecture of the cell  <cit> . moreover, integrins can alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton via proteins of the rho family, which also regulate ctgf  <cit> . ctgf, besides having profibrotic function, can act as a mediator of growth arrest  <cit> . in mcs, disassembly of actin stress fibers with an inhibitor of rho family proteins resulted in inhibition of ctgf expression  <cit> . we could show that mcs lacking a <dig> integrin rearrange their actin cytoskeleton and downregulate ctgf.

changes in the cytoskeletal architecture can alter cell adhesion and motility  <cit> . in a previous study, we showed that compared to wild type mcs, a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs adhered weaker to fibronectin and vitronectin, two ligands for a <dig> integrin, but adhered more easily on collagens, which are not ligands for a <dig> integrin  <cit> . on the other hand, a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs migrated more easily on fibronectin or vitronectin than wild type cells  <cit> . these results support the notion that α <dig> integrin could serve as an anti-migratory integrin, keeping mcs resting at their native location. firm adhesion, as mediated by α <dig> integrin, inhibits migration in many cell types  <cit> . thus the decreased ability of α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs to adhere to fibronectin or vitronectin could contribute to the increased ability of these cells to migrate. given these differences in migratory abilities, we hypothesized in the present study that wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs also differ in their cytoskeletal architecture and general morphology.

downregulation of a-smooth muscle actin expression in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs leads to a reduction in a-smooth muscle actin containing stress fibers and consequently to a reduction in firm adhesion. this in turn seems to lead to increased cell motility of a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs. similar observations were made in vsmcs after sirna knockdown of a <dig> integrin expression  <cit> : treatment with a <dig> integrin sirna reduced expression of a-smooth muscle actin and increased cell migration, which is in contrast to our findings in a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs, where both the a <dig> integrin-deficient and the wild type genotype expressed a-smooth muscle actin in comparable amounts. the reasons for the discrepancy of the results of the studies in vsmcs after blockade of a <dig> integrin expression with sirna and in a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs are unclear at present. our results regarding a-smooth muscle actin expression in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs are reminiscent of the findings of zaghram et al.  <cit>  after sirna blockade of a <dig> integrin in vsmcs. we therefore wanted to investigate the differences in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs and a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs: a compensatory increase of integrin chains a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> was detected in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs. a similar increase of integrin expression was not found in a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs. thus, it seems possible that changes in the cytoskeletal architecture and a-smooth muscle actin expression in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs is not a direct consequence of the lack of a <dig> integrin, but more likely due to the induction of other integrin chains. a <dig> integrin is usually not expressed in mcs, but is an integrin characteristic of epithelial cells, while a <dig> integrin is a typical mesenchymal integrin  <cit> . during kidney development, downregulation of a <dig> integrin, possibly by wt- <dig>  <cit> , results in epithelialization of mesenchymal cells and in the formation of tubular structures  <cit> . for this reason, we tested if a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs exhibit reduced expression of other mesenchymal markers or increased expression of a typical epithelial marker, widely used in the detection of epithelial-mesenchymal transition  <cit> . a reduction of desmin expression was readily detected, but vimentin expression was not reduced and e-cadherin expression was very low in a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs. these findings argue against the hypothesis that lack of a <dig> integrin, along with increased expression of a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> integrins, leads to an epithelialization of mcs, but more likely might result in dedifferentiation of mcs. why a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs undergo these changes in integrin expression and cytoskeletal architecture, while a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs do not, remains unclear. discrepancies in the differentiation status might influence the ability of cells to dedifferentiate more easily than others. mcs and vsmcs might also use distinct transcriptional mechanisms, like it was described for smooth muscle cell and myofibroblast a-smooth muscle actin expression  <cit> . moreover, no explanation exists to date as to why vsmcs after blockade of a <dig> integrin with sirna behave differently from a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs regarding a-smooth muscle actin expression and cytoskeletal rearrangements. as shown by zargham et al.  <cit> , blockade of a <dig> integrin with sirna results in a dysregulation of the expression of other integrins, like an increased expression of the a <dig>  a <dig> and av chains, or reduced expression of the a <dig> chain. in our isolations of a <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs we did not observe significant increases in the expression of the a <dig>  a <dig> and av chains, while the expression of the a <dig> chain indeed was reduced. one has to be aware that acute blockade of a <dig> integrin with sirna in vsmcs might not be consistent with a genetic knockdown of a <dig>  which is more comparable to a chronic deficiency from the time of vsmc differentiation on. as a consequence, many regulatory pathways might differ in the two cell types. moreover, the findings with blockade of a <dig> integrin with sirna was obtained in rat vsmcs  <cit> , while our data are derived from mouse vsmcs. species differences might exist with regard to vsmc biology.

finally, differences in the properties of mcs and vsmcc lacking a <dig> integrin were detected regarding cell growth. while a <dig> integrin-deficient mcs had significantly increased proliferation rates on ligands for a <dig> integrin compared to wild type mcs  <cit> , wild type and α <dig> integrin-deficient vsmcs showed a comparable growth response after stimulation. thus it is conceivable that the cytoskeletal and matrix receptor changes in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs may result in changes in proliferative capacities of these cells. both α <dig> and α <dig> integrin chains, which are upregulated in α <dig> integrin-deficient mcs, can promote cell proliferation  <cit> . on the other hand, increased proliferation rates in mcs lacking a <dig> integrin might be a consequence of rho-mediated disruption of actin stress fibers, leading to increased expression of ctgf, which was described to act anti-proliferative  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a lack of a <dig> integrin appears to be of little consequence in vsmcs whereas the deficiency of this integrin has profound effects on the mc phenotype. the different abilities of both cell types to induce other integrin chains might well result in different phosphorylation patterns of kinases involved in integrin signaling, which could lead to a different activation of signaling cascades, causing differences in cytoskeletal characteristics and proliferation capacities.
