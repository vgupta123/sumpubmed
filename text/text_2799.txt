BACKGROUND
the aquaporins , also known as the major intrinsic protein superfamily , are a family of integral membrane proteins. in mammals,  <dig> aquaporins were described . there are two subfamilies: the aquaporins, which transport only water, and the aquaglyceroporins, which transport glycerol, urea, and other small solutes in addition to water  <cit> . an exception is aqp <dig>  which is permeated by anions  <cit> . aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins are present throughout the body, including in the plasma membrane of renal epithelia, brain astrocytes, and red blood cells  <cit> .

here we focus on aqp <dig>  a protein with lower homology to previously characterized aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. aqp <dig> was previously described in mice  <cit> , although the authors were unable to measure solute transport. we aimed to establish the tissue distribution of rat aqp <dig> and to identify solutes transported by rat and human aqp <dig> 

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of aqp11
searching the human genome using psi-blast, we found two genes with sequences related to members of the aquaporin gene family . both were also present in rat and mouse genomes. these genes were previously annotated as aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> . a search for conserved domains  <cit>  revealed a significant alignment with mip domain, a feature of all aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. mouse aqp <dig> is expressed in pancreas; transport studies were inconclusive because tagged aqp <dig> failed to traffic to the surface of xenopus oocytes  <cit> . during preparation of this manuscript, morishita and colleagues published a report on mouse aqp11; transport studies were also inconclusive because tagged aqp <dig> failed to traffic to the surface of xenopus oocytes  <cit> .

using pcr, we amplified human aqp <dig> from colon cdna, and mouse and rat aqp <dig> from testes cdna. human aqp <dig> is 91% similar and 82% identical to rat aqp <dig>  and 92% similar and 83% identical to mouse aqp <dig> . aqp <dig> is 24–33% similar , and approximately 10% identical, to the previously characterized mammalian aquaporins , but 41% similar and 23% identical to aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> is most similar to aqp <dig>  and least similar to aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> . aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> are similar to non-mammalian aquaporins present in plant arabidopsis thaliana , puffer-fish tetraodon nigroviridis , mosquito anopheles gambiae and fruitfly drosophila melanogaster , and nematodes caenorhabditis elegans and c. briggsae . in addition to mouse and rat, human aqp <dig> has homologous putative genes in the dingo canis familiaris  and in the chicken gallus gallus . sequence alignments and analysis of the phylogenetic tree suggest that aqp <dig> and  <dig> are distinct from the known mammalian aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins  and may comprise a new mip subfamily .

compared to other mammalian aquaporins, aqp <dig> has several unique attributes . the two asn-pro-ala motifs of the aquaporin superfamily are present, although the first contains a cysteine instead of an alanine. following the second asn-pro-ala, aqp <dig> has a leucine, where all other mammalian aquaporins have an arginine. based on the high-resolution structures of aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  glpf, and aqpz  <cit> , this leucine is one of four residues which form the selectivity filter, the narrowest region of the monomeric pore. in the region of the pore leading from the constriction point to the cytoplasm, the other aquaporins have ser-gly--his. aqp <dig> has val-gly-thr-ser. the histidine  is conserved in all other mammalian aquaporins. similarly, the region of the pore leading to the outside of the membrane is not conserved in aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> contains a bulky, aromatic phenylalanine, where the other aquaporins have a methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or valine. these changes may have a significant impact on solute transport. based on this sequence alignment, the polarity and size of the constriction region of aqp <dig> is quite different from the other aquaporins. in addition, the change in amino acids lining the pore could greatly limit the size and/or charge of solutes transported by aqp <dig>  because the similarity to other aquaporins for which there is a high-resolution structure is so low, we were unable to use homology modeling to predict the 3-dimensional structure of aqp <dig> 

aqp <dig> mrna expression in rat tissues
we probed a rat multiple-tissue northern blot for aqp <dig> . the rat aqp <dig> predicted open reading frame is  <dig> nucleotides, coding for  <dig> amino acids. we found prominent bands, between  <dig>  and  <dig> kilobases , in testes, liver, kidney and brain. the bands in kidney and liver were slightly smaller than the bands in testes and brain. these tissues also had bands above  <dig>  kb, as did spleen and heart.

rt-pcr analysis revealed the expression of mrna encoding aqp <dig> in a range of rat tissues . in agreement with our northern blot, we found aqp <dig> message in brain cerebrum, in the renal cortex, and in testis. we also detected aqp <dig> in the intestinal tract from duodenum to ileum, and weaker expression in choroid plexus, cerebellum, colon and liver. since this rt-pcr was not quantitative, it is impossible to infer relative message abundance. in microisolated renal structures, we found mrna only in proximal tubules and not in glomeruli, thin limbs of the medulla, thick ascending limbs of the medulla and cortex, distal convoluted tubules, or in collecting ducts . this is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating aqp <dig> immunostaining in mouse kidney cortex proximal tubule but not in distal tubule  <cit> .

characterization of anti-aqp <dig> antibodies in cultured cells
to elucidate aqp <dig> protein distribution, we generated antibodies against the c-terminus and n-terminus of rat aqp <dig>  we transiently transfected cultured chinese hamster ovary cells  with rat aqp <dig> and stained them with our c-term antibody . we saw predominantly intracellular staining and some staining at the plasma membrane, and no staining in cells transfected with empty vector. aqp <dig> immunoblots of surface biotinylated cho cell lysates confirmed that aqp <dig> is present at both the plasma membrane and in the cytosol in transfected cho cells . we saw no bands in cells transfected with empty vector or in cells transfected with aquaporin- <dig>  demonstrating the specificity of our c-term antibody. we obtained similar results in transiently transfected mdck and hek <dig> cells using both n-term and c-term antibodies .

aqp <dig> protein expression in rat tissues
based on amino acid composition, the estimated molecular weight of rat aqp <dig> is  <dig> kda. an anti-aqp <dig> c-term immunoblot of multiple rat tissue membrane proteins revealed two prominent bands: an approximately  <dig> kda band in brain, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle; and an approximately  <dig> kda band in testes, kidney, and liver . de-glycosylation  or de-phosphorylation  assays did not produce changes in protein migration patterns . as a control, we also probed total protein lysate from cultured hek <dig> cells transfected with rat aqp <dig>  this produced only the  <dig> kda band. both bands disappeared when the antibody was preadsorbed to the antigenic peptide . there appears to be no correlation between the transcript size  and the protein size , as the testes contain a larger band in the northern blot  but a smaller band in the western blot.

our results demonstrate rat aqp <dig> rna and protein are found in testis, kidney, liver, and brain. we failed to detect aqp <dig> rna in skeletal muscle and heart , although western blot of these tissues was positive . since rna loading was normalized against β-actin hybridization signal , this discrepancy could be due to low levels of aqp <dig> rna in these tissues.

biochemical and structural evidence shows that many mammalian aquaporins form tetramers  <cit> . we subjected rat brain hemisphere membrane proteins to sucrose density ultra-centrifugation and found that aqp <dig> sediments in similar fractions as aqp <dig>  a water channel known to form tetramers . in agreement with previous work, we detected aqp <dig> in fractions 10– <dig>  with a peak in fractions 13– <dig>  <cit> . aqp <dig> was found in fractions 8– <dig>  with a peak in fractions 11– <dig>  this distribution overlaps significantly, though not perfectly. regardless, the first several fractions lack aqp <dig>  and it is in these fractions where we would expect to find an aqp <dig> monomer. we conclude that aqp <dig>  like aqp <dig>  exists in rat brain as a multi-subunit oligomer – presumably a tetramer like aqp <dig> and other aquaporins.

functional expression of aqp <dig> in xenopus oocytes
we injected oocytes with human aqp <dig>  myc-tagged human aqp <dig>  or rat aqp <dig> and confirmed surface expression of the second two proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy and by immunoblot . using an oocyte swelling assay, we tested aqp11-injected oocytes for transport of water, glycerol, or urea . compared to controls, oocytes injected with  <dig> ng or  <dig> ng of human wildtype or myc-tagged aqp <dig> crna showed no increase in the rate of water transport. rate of water transport was significantly less than in oocytes expressing an orthodox water channel, such as human aqp <dig> or rat aqp <dig> . additionally, we failed to detect transport of glycerol or urea in aqp11-injected oocytes. rate of glycerol and urea transport was similar to control oocytes, and significantly less than in oocytes expressing rat aqp <dig>  an aquaglyceroporin that transports glycerol and urea .

xenopus oocytes were injected with  <dig> nl water , or with  <dig> ng human aqp <dig> , rat aqp <dig> , rat aqp <dig> , human aqp <dig> , myc-tagged human aqp <dig> , or with  <dig> ng human aqp <dig> crna and tested for water, glycerol, urea, and ion transport. some oocytes were pre-incubated for  <dig> minutes with  <dig>  mm hgcl <dig> . units for water transport are μm/sec, for glycerol and urea transport 10- <dig> cm/sec, and for ion conductance μa/v. data represent mean ± sd for 6– <dig> oocytes, except for ion conductance which is mean ± se for 3– <dig> oocytes.

solute transport through other aquaporins, such as aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  is affected by ph  <cit> . lack of solute transport by aqp11-injected oocytes, however, was unaffected by raising the ph to  <dig> , or by lowering the ph to  <dig> or  <dig>  . incubating the oocytes with hgcl <dig> did not alter the water, glycerol, or urea permeability of aqp11-injected oocytes, although it did inhibit water transport in aqp2-injected oocytes and glycerol and urea transport in aqp9-injected oocytes . we also failed to see a change in ion conductance in oocytes expressing aqp <dig> . oocytes injected with aqp <dig>  however, showed an appreciable increase in conductance compared to water injected oocytes. at ph  <dig> , aqp <dig> injected oocytes showed no significant difference in ion conductance versus water injected control oocytes . similar results occurred at ph  <dig>  , whereas aqp <dig> injected oocytes displayed conductance values almost five times higher than oocytes injected with rat or human aqp <dig> or with water .

xenopus oocytes were injected with  <dig> nl water , or with  <dig> ng human aqp <dig> , rat aqp <dig> , rat aqp <dig> m <dig> , rat aqp <dig> , rat aqp <dig> , human aqp <dig> , myc-tagged human aqp <dig> , or with  <dig> ng human aqp <dig> crna and tested for water, glycerol, or urea transport or ion conductance at indicated ph. units for water transport are μm/sec, for glycerol and urea transport 10- <dig> cm/sec, for ion conductance μa/v. data represent mean ± sd for 6– <dig> oocytes, except for ion conductance which is mean ± se for 3– <dig> oocytes.

based on these oocyte studies, we conclude that under these conditions aqp <dig> does not transport water, glycerol, urea, or ions. it is possible that a putative aqp <dig> channel is closed unless a ligand or other regulatory molecule is present. it is also possible that aqp <dig> does not act as a solute channel in vivo. like aqp <dig>  a poor water channel that forms membrane junctions in the lens of the eye  <cit> , the role of aqp <dig> may be primarily structural. it is also possible that aqp <dig> transports a different, untested solute, such as ammonium, co <dig>  or no <dig>  finally, it is possible that aqp <dig> is not functional when expressed in oocytes. if true, this would be the first aquaporin that fails to function when expressed in oocytes.

a previous study reported that exogenous mouse aqp <dig> was not targeted to the plasma membrane in oocytes  <cit> . this conflicts with our observations using rat aqp <dig>  this discrepancy could be due to the amino acid differences between rat and mouse aqp <dig>  alternatively, it could be because the previous study utilized aqp <dig> tagged with gfp or v <dig>  these tags may alter aqp <dig> localization in oocytes.

aqp <dig> in rat brain
to further elucidate the location of aqp <dig> in rat brain, we stained rat brain sections with aqp <dig> n-term antibody. we found staining primarily in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex . in the cerebellum, aqp <dig> immunoreactivity was associated with the dendrites of purkinje cells. immunofluorescence microscopy revealed punctate labeling, indicative of intracellular localization . in the hippocampus, aqp <dig> positive neurons were found in the ca <dig> and ca <dig>  in cerebral cortex, staining was absent in cortical layer i, but present in layers ii-vi. we failed to see strong staining in other areas of the brain, such as in the thalamus or near the ventricles. similar staining was obtained with anti-c-terminal aqp <dig> antibodies . future studies using electron miscroscopy are necessary to more definitively assess the cellular localization of aqp <dig> 

a previous study demonstrated aqp <dig> protein expression in mouse kidney  <cit> ; using our aqp <dig> antibodies we were unable to see staining in rat kidney . the authors of the previous study did not stain brain sections, but they did note that mice lacking aqp <dig> began dying  <dig> days after birth, with renal failure and polycystic kidneys  <cit> . one explanation for the discrepancy might be due to differences in aqp <dig> localization in mouse versus rat kidney. in rat kidney, perhaps the termini of aqp <dig> are not accessible for antibody interaction.

aqp <dig> localization in the brain is different from the other brain aquaporins. aqp <dig> is restricted to astrocytes throughout the brain, while aqp <dig> is present in the choroid plexus  <cit> . aqp <dig> is present in astrocytes  <cit>  as well as in a population of catecholaminergic neurons  <cit> . the apparent intracellular localization of aqp <dig> in purkinje cells is unusual. only aqp <dig> is predominantly intracellular in vivo. the unique distribution and the apparent lack of water/solute transport by aqp <dig> may predict a unique function.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe rat aqp <dig>  an aquaporin with lower similarity to known mammalian aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins. aqp <dig>  along with aqp <dig>  may comprise a new aquaporin subfamily. unlike other aquaporins, we were unable to demonstrate transport of water, glycerol, urea, or ions by aqp <dig>  this is likely due to putative pore-lining residues that are not conserved between aqp <dig> and other mammalian aquaporins. aqp <dig> is expressed in a variety of rat tissues. in the brain, aqp <dig> is found in purkinje cells, hippocampal neurons of ca <dig> and ca <dig>  and cerebral cortical neurons. future studies are necessary to elucidate the physiological role of aqp <dig> in the brain.
