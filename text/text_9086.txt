BACKGROUND
laminae are interdigitated dermal and epidermal tissues found in the hooves of livestock that form the attachment to the distal skeleton. equids have an additional specialization in the form of secondary laminae that project from the primary laminae which further increase the surface area and thus strengthen this connection  <cit> . the junction between dermal and epidermal laminae must be strong enough to withstand the forces of weight bearing and motion without separation, while providing sufficient flexibility to absorb concussive forces and allow growth. inflammation of the laminae  is a devastating disease that can lead to separation of these tissues and a rotation of the third phalanx  away from the hoof wall.

the etiology of laminitis is poorly understood. many risk factors have been identified in the horse, including inflammation in other parts of the body, sepsis, metabolic conditions, or mechanical stress  <cit> . currently, as there are very few treatments available, prevention through avoiding known risk factors is recommended. in the early stages of laminitis , prolonged cooling of the hooves in ice water has been shown to reduce severity of the disease and prevent separation of the laminae  <cit> . however, if adequate treatment is not provided promptly, euthanasia is often the result. a study from the united states department of agriculture in  <dig> estimated the annual cost of lameness at $ <dig> million, with laminitis accounting for  <dig> % of the reported cases  <cit> . the american association of equine practitioners has specifically identified laminitis as the disease most frequently reported as needing more research  <cit> .

several methods have been devised to experimentally induce laminitis, including carbohydrate overload, oligofructose overload, and black walnut extract administration. although all of these models will result in the disease, key differences in physiological response  have been demonstrated  <cit> . however, as natural cases can be much more difficult to acquire, these models continue to serve an important role in research.

gene expression has been applied in studies to better understand the disease process. however, much of this research has focused on the expression of few known genes, using qpcr to target specific pathways . only two studies have attempted a transcriptome-wide view of laminitis. the first commercially available whole-transcriptome equine-specific microarray was not published until  <dig>  therefore early studies attempted two different approaches. the first study chose to use cross-species hybridization with the bovine gene expression chip, identifying  <dig> out of the  <dig>  genes assayed to be significantly up-regulated  <cit> . they were unable to identify any down-regulated genes, which was likely due to the high false-negative rate associated with imperfect hybridization. a second study instead generated a custom equine-specific array with  <dig> targets derived from leukocyte est libraries  <cit> . less than  <dig> of these genes were found to have significant differential expression.

both of these projects, and any current work utilizing microarrays, are hindered by insufficient genome annotation in the horse. the only major annotation attempt used an older sequencing technology, generating  <dig> bp reads from eight diverse tissue types  <cit> . they identified that  <dig> % of genes displayed tissue-specific expression patterns, with  <dig> % of the genes only found in one tissue type. however, this data was not incorporated into automatic annotation pipelines for the popular genome browsers, and lamellar tissue was not included in sequencing. using this data, the authors also demonstrated there were  <dig> genes completely lacking in equine annotation, even though many of these genes have data in other species  <cit> .

whole transcriptome sequencing  is a promising solution for interrogation of gene structure and expression, especially in a divergent tissue like the hoof. rna-seq is a hypothesis-free examination of all cdna in a given sample, allowing for the identification of unique features such as unannotated transcription, splice sites, allele-specific expression, anti-sense expression, and alternative poly-adenylation . additionally, technical variation is reportedly low, with high reproducibility between lanes  <cit> . studies have continuously demonstrated high correlation between microarray differential expression studies and rna-seq strategies, noting the main difference is improved sensitivity for low-abundance transcripts by rna-seq  <cit> . however, as rna-seq is still considerably more expensive and computationally intense than microarrays, much mainstream research still relies on microarrays or qpcr.

the objective of this study was to produce a transcriptome resource for the study of laminitis. given that recent studies rely heavily on qpcr, the generation of a set of equine, hoof-specific transcripts can greatly benefit in the selection of novel targets for expression studies. current annotation is largely based on computational predictions and gene models from other species, among which there is not a good physiological model for the laminae. additionally, while there have been a few equine rna-seq studies, raw data is often only placed in public databases and not fully processed or curated . thus these valuable datasets are difficult to access and may require intensive bioinformatic analysis before use in subsequent projects, and sadly are often underutilized.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and assembly
whole transcriptome sequencing of the three samples in this experiment generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. sequencing data from all three individuals was pooled for assembly in order to capture genes that may be rare or unique to the laminitic state. after filtering,  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads remained. the iassembler pipeline was used to correct for misassemblies due to heterozygosity   <cit> . a summary of assembly metrics can be found in table  <dig>  <cit> . the number of unigenes  mapped per locus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  averaging  <dig>  isoforms representing  <dig>  loci. many of these unigenes are shorter transcripts covering only a single exon or splice junction, partially due to low-expression transcripts lacking sufficient coverage for assembly . considering only the longer 3+ exon transcripts resulted in similar statistics .table  <dig> de novo assembly statistics

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we utilized rna-seq to successfully generate a transcriptome assembly of equine lamellar tissue. as the hoof is a specialized tissue, it likely has unique transcripts that previous annotation efforts would have missed. by pooling data from healthy and diseased tissues, we have captured loci that should be valuable to future differential expression studies. though the varied physiological states could result in differences between each transcriptome, pooling the data prior to assembly ensures sufficient power to assemble lower expressed loci. this data set represents a valuable tool for laminitis research, providing information on both known genes expressed in the hoof, as well as a wealth of previously unannotated transcripts. the transcripts identified in this study can now be utilized with other technologies to search for novel targets with relevance to laminitis.

rna-seq provides unprecedented power for transcript and isoform discovery. however, relatively little of this information trickles down to human-readable annotation and applied datasets useful to the average molecular biologist. while some resources now exist that attempt to bridge this gap by providing bioinformatics instruction for molecular biologists, this approach is not practical for all researchers  <cit> . our newly generated data is available in two ways. raw reads and identified variants have been deposited in public databases, so that they may be accessed or incorporated into automated pipelines. ncbi has recently begun to advantageously incorporate rna-seq data from the short-read archive into their refseq annotation pipeline, and the inclusion of additional unique tissue types is essential for robust annotation from this automated analysis. however, these updated annotations  are not always readily accessible in popular genome browsers. therefore, we have also provided downloadable browser extensible data  tracks of our assembly. the first file, labeled the “full” assembly, includes models of any number of exons. we have also provided only those models with  <dig> or more exons  in order to remove partial transcripts likely originating from poorly expressed loci and intronless non-coding rnas. the bed format is small and much easier to use than the raw sequencing data itself, including only the positions of each feature . bed files also are quite easy for individual researchers to load gene model annotation into their browser of choice  <cit> .

our data also includes potential non-coding rnas, which are an emerging field of research. as the refseq set is specifically designed for protein-coding genes, all other transcript types are not given accession numbers. there are existing databases of non-coding rnas available for the human and mouse genomes, however for all other species, there are only the few  entries manually curated from the literature  <cit> . unlike protein-coding genes, there is considerably less sequence conservation between species in non-coding rnas, necessitating within species identification  <cit> . within non-coding rnas, there are two main classes: small  and long   <cit> . while long non-coding rnas are often picked up in normal rna-seq experiments , the smaller molecules are often excluded in normal rna-seq library preparation, and require additional methodologies to sequence.

the function of non-coding rnas has been the subject of recent controversy. it is debatable whether the observed rna transcription is biologically relevant, or if transcription may simply be technical noise  <cit> . well documented functions for non-coding rna include regulation of the genome  and of cellular differentiation during development . one of the most well-known non-coding rnas is xist, which regulates x chromosome inactivation in females. more recently, several mutations that cause overexpression of a conserved long non-coding rna proved to be responsible for the bovine polled phenotype  <cit> . it is thus important to consider all possible rnas in studies of differential expression, instead of only the protein-coding transcripts.

utilization of this data in studies of laminitis could identify new targets and pathways to help further our understanding of the etiology. whereas current veterinary methods generally can only detect laminitis at the onset of lameness, the development of biomarkers could allow for rapid identification  of cases before permanent damage occurs. future understanding of the precise pathways underlying laminitis could lead to vital novel prevention methods and treatments.
