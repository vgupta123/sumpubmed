BACKGROUND
polyploidy is an important factor in the evolution of many plants and has attracted considerable scientific attention for a long period of time. many important economical crops are of polyploid origin, including wheat, cotton, and rapeseed  <cit> . cruciferae includes the model species arabidopsis thaliana and the economically important brassica crops. these important crops include three diploid brassica species, namely, b. rapa , b. nigra , and b. oleracea , and three allopolyploids spontaneously derived from pairwise hybridization of the diploids, which are b. napus , b. juncea , and b. carinata   <cit> . lysak et al.  confirmed the chromosome triplication history of brassica that corresponds to that of arabidopsis  <cit> . cheung et al.  found that the divergence of arabidopsis and brassica lineage was approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> , and the replicated brassica subgenomes  was diverged by  <dig>  mya  <cit> . in addition, the a and c genomes were estimated with  <dig>  mya divergence. woodhouse et al.  stated that the b. rapa lineage underwent a whole-genome triplication of 5– <dig> mya  <cit> . for the allopolyploids, b. napus probably arose from the natural hybridization of a and c genomes around  <dig>  years ago. however, when the hybridization between a and b genomes and between b and c genomes happened is still unclear. the precise ancestors of b. napus, b. juncea, and b. carinata are not yet identified  <cit> . the duplication of gene segments reported on brassica is explained as frequent loss, remote genome duplication, or unbalanced homologous recombination  <cit> . during the divergence of brassica species, the sub-functionalization and/or neo-functionalization of these paralogs coupled with novel gene interactions contribute significantly to genome evolution  <cit> . moreover, genetic mapping and sequencing analysis substantiate the triplication hypothesis of diploid brassica genomes  <cit> . the comparative mapping of brassica by using genetic markers has successfully revealed homologous rearrangements, translocations, and fusions that are crucial to the diversification of the a, b, and c genomes from a. thaliana  <cit> .

many linkage maps and karyotype analysis have identified extensive collinearity and genomic polymorphisms among brassica genomes. given the complexity of the gene copy number and syntenic conservation caused by polyploidization, brassica genomes are difficult to study  <cit> . identifying the genes related to specific traits based on the linkage maps is also challenging because of the complexity of the homologs and paralogs in polyploidy genomes  <cit> . profiling arrays of a. thaliana are useful in the transcriptome analysis of brassica  <cit> . however, a. thaliana-based microarrays lack the resolution of brassica specific genes and paralogous genes. furthermore, brassica microarrays were developed to confirm brassica-specific expressed genes  <cit> . identifying different homologous copies of brassica sequences is challenging for microarray expression analysis  <cit> . next-generation sequencing is an optimal method for genomic and transcriptomic studies and provides opportunities for polyploidy studies and enables the extensive genome profiling of crops with complex genomes, such as soybean, potato, tomato, cotton, maize, and common bean  <cit> . this technology also promotes sequencing analysis in brassica; the genome sequence of b. rapa has already been released and annotated  <cit> . the genome sequencing of b. oleracea, b. nigra, and b. napus is still in progress. however, the genome sequences of b. oleracea are available in the basic local alignment search tool in brassica database . the transcriptome profiling of b. napus has been analyzed via rna sequencing  <cit> . this information is valuable for the investigation of brassica genome evolution. many technologies have been applied to quantify transcript abundance, including microarray, serial analysis of gene expression, digital gene expression , and rna-seq. dge and rna-seq have been widely used to identify the molecular information of plant transcriptome and gene expression variation between comparable samples. dge, as a well-known technique suitable to directly quantify transcript abundance counts, is optimized over rna-seq because of its cost efficiency. rna-seq is a flexible approach that can detect full-transcript sequence, alternative splicing, exon boundaries, and transcript abundance. however, each transcript in rna-seq can be mapped multiple times, and the sequencing depth of rna-seq is correlated with but is not equal to transcript abundance. each read in dge is expected with a sole hit on an rna molecule. therefore, dge is better to represent rare transcripts or exclude transcripts with less interest than rna-seq  <cit> .

many studies have analyzed the genomic and phenotypic changes in synthesized brassica, particularly b. napus and hexaploid brassica  <cit> . however, limited information is available for the natural species of brassica. in the present research, we performed dge analysis on three diploid brassica species  and three allopolyploids  to determine the transcriptome changes after natural polyploidization. the expression profile of the genes in the six brassica species was reported, and the multiple gene expression differences were observed. differentially expressed genes  are involved in a wide range of stress resistance and development processes. this study is the first transcriptomic research that identifies degs and the pathways involved in the natural polyploidization of the six brassica species.

RESULTS
dge profile
this research investigates the transcriptome profiling of diploids and spontaneous allopolyploids in brassica by performing dge analysis on the seeding stage of the six brassica species, namely, b. rapa , b. nigra , b. oleracea , b. napus , b. juncea , and b. carinata . dge libraries from the leaves of four-week-old plants were generated and sequenced by an illumina technology. the sequence data are available from the geo repository with an accession number of gse <dig>  the statistics of the dge tags are shown in table  <dig>  approximately six million raw tags were generated for each library. clean tags were obtained after removing the low-quality sequences and adaptor sequences from the raw data.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clean tags were obtained in br, bg, bo, bn, bj, and bc, respectively. unambiguous tags  were counted and normalized to tpm to evaluate the gene expression level. to evaluate the normality of the dge data, the distribution of the total tags and distinct clean tags  over different tag copy numbers was analyzed. the distribution of the tag expression was similar for each library. moreover, the distribution of clean tags in the six libraries showed that most of the tags are from highly expressed genes . the percentage of distinct tags with high counts dropped dramatically, and the distinct tags with more than  <dig> copies accounted for less than 8%. however, more than 67% of the total clean tags accounted for more than  <dig> copies in each library. by contrast, more than 43% of the distinct clean tags had copy numbers between two and five, which represented approximately 96% of the total number of clean tags. generally, a small number of categories of mrna showed high abundance, whereas the other majority had a quite low expression level. this finding indicates that only a small number of mrnas are expressed at high abundance, and majority of them are expressed at very low levels  <cit> .table  <dig>

clean tags are tags after filtering low-quality tags from raw data. distinct tags are different tags and unambiguous tags are the remaining clean tags after removing tags mapped to more than one locus of reference genome.
distribution of total tag and distinct tag counts over different tag abundance categories from the six libraries.




the clean tags were then mapped onto the b. rapa genome with a maximum of one base-pair mismatch  <cit> . table  <dig> shows that the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tags in br, bg, bo, bn, bj, and bc were mapped to b. rapa genome, respectively. statistical analysis of clean tag alignment was conducted, including the analysis of total clean tags and distinct clean tags . more than 54% of the total clean tags and 42% of the distinct clean tags in each library were mapped onto the b. rapa genome. however, the tags mapped in the dge library of bg and bc were lower than those in the other four libraries, which might be due to the divergence of the b genome to the a/c genome. moreover, the tag mapping onto the b. rapa genome generated  <dig> tag-mapped genes for br,  <dig> for bg,  <dig> for bo,  <dig> for bn,  <dig> for bj, and  <dig> for bc. in total, approximately 61% of the genes in the b. rapa genome  could be mapped with unique tags . furthermore, we mapped all the clean tags of each dge library to the genome of a. thaliana, and the summary and details of the mapping result are listed in additional file  <dig>  only approximately 47% of a. thaliana genes  were successfully mapped, and the percent of unambiguous tag-mapped genes in a. thaliana is much lower than in b. rapa. the number of dge tags in each library that well matched with arabidopsis genome is also lower than that mapped to b. rapa. the difference in mapping rate is in accordance with the prediction that the a, b, and c genomes of brassica diverged after the divergence of arabidopsis and brassica lineages  <cit> . thus, we chose the mapping information that used b. rapa as reference for further analysis. saturation analysis was performed to check if the number of detected genes increased with sequencing amount. the result showed that the number of detected genes stopped increasing when the number of reads reached  <dig> million . the distribution of the ratio of distinct tag copy numbers in each pair of libraries was analyzed. more than 90% of the distinct tags had ratios up to five folds .

degs in brassica diploids
the degs in brassica diploids  were compared  to analyze the gene expression variations . a comparison of br and bo showed that  <dig> and  <dig> degs were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. by contrast,  <dig> degs were down-regulated and  <dig> degs were up-regulated in br compared with bg.figure  <dig>

moreover,  <dig> degs were down-regulated and  <dig> degs were up-regulated in bo compared with bg. the number of degs in bg compared with br/bo was more than br vs. bo, which indicates that the a and c genomes of brassica were closer than the b genome. among the  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the pair comparison of the three diploids , bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig> were up-regulated in bg compared with br/bo. moreover, bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig> were down-regulated in bg compared with br/bo. most degs between br and bo differed from those between br and bg as well as between bo and bg. figure 3a shows the distribution of the genes commonly expressed in br, bg, and bo, and  <dig> genes were co-expressed in the three diploid libraries apart from the degs. a second filter of expression differences  was performed in the pairwise comparisons to reduce the total number of significant changes. this analysis revealed  <dig> significantly expressed genes, such as br vs. bg =  <dig>  br vs. bo =  <dig>  and bg vs. bo =  <dig> . the functional significance of the genes expressed in each library was examined, and the go analysis results are shown in figure 3c. the well-annotated gene sequences were assigned to  <dig> functional groups of the three main go categories . the results showed that dges were primarily involved in the cell and organelle, in the binding, catalytic, cellular, and metabolic process, as well as in response to stimulus. two specific processes, the extracellular region part and the molecular transducer, were unique to bo. however, bo lacked a transporter, and bg lacked anatomical structure formation.figure  <dig>

degs among allopolyploids and ancestral diploid progenitors
to identify the degs in allopolyploids and ancient diploid progenitors, the dge profiles of br vs. bn, bo vs. bn, br vs. bj, bg vs. bj, bg vs. bc, and bo vs. bc were compared to analyze the gene expression variations after natural polyploidization . the results showed that  <dig> degs were up-regulated and  <dig> degs were down-regulated in bn compared with br, whereas  <dig> degs were up-regulated and  <dig> degs were down-regulated in bn compared with bo. after natural polyploidization,  <dig> degs were induced in bj compared with br, whereas  <dig> degs were down-regulated. moreover,  <dig> degs were induced in bj compared with bg, whereas  <dig> degs were down-regulated. with regard to bc,  <dig> degs were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated compared with bg, and  <dig> degs were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated compared with bg. the variations in the gene expression among the diploids and amphidiploids are essential to the diversity of phenotype, growth, and production. the  <dig> most abundantly expressed genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated in the pair comparison of amphidiploids and diploids are listed in additional file  <dig>  the distribution of the genes that were commonly and uniquely expressed in amphidiploid and its ancestral diploids is shown in figure  <dig>  the results further show that  <dig> genes were conserved in br, bo, and bn, whereas  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were specifically expressed in br, bo, and bn, respectively . a similar pattern was observed when bj was compared with br/bg  and bc with bg/bo . the expressional differences of species-specific genes might be caused by the genome interaction during natural polyploidization. the go pattern of the genes in amphidiploid and ancestral diploids is shown in figure  <dig>  based on figure 6a, the numbers of dges in the envelope, extracellular region, macromolecular complex, biological regulation, cellular component biogenesis, death, multicellular organism process, and pigmentation were different in br, bo, and bn. gos of molecular transducer was found in bo only. apparent go difference was observed among br, bg, and bj . as shown in figure 6c, gos of transporter were found in bg only, and anatomical structure formation was not present in bg.figure  <dig>

functional annotation of degs
pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the expressed transcripts of the six dge libraries. this analysis was performed by mapping all annotated genes in the kegg database to search for significantly enriched genes involved in the metabolic or signal transduction pathways . among the genes with kegg annotation, degs were identified in bn compared with br. in total,  <dig> degs were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways, and  <dig> of these pathways were significantly enriched with q values ≤  <dig>  . the enriched pathways include metabolic, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and peroxisome. a similiar pathway enrichment was discovered in pair comparison of other libraries . the  <dig> degs identified in bn vs. bo were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways,  <dig> of which were significantly enriched. the  <dig> degs identified in bj vs. br were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways, the  <dig> degs identified in bj vs. bg were assigned to  <dig> pathways, the  <dig> degs identified in bc vs. bg were assigned to  <dig> pathways, and the  <dig> degs identified in bc vs. bo were assigned to  <dig> pathways. all these pathways are involved in the process of plant growth and stress reaction, which are important for the morphological and physiological differences among the brassica species. the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, which was significantly enriched in bo vs. bn and bg vs. bc, explains the different fatty acid compositions in brassica species  <cit> . the degs identified in the peroxisome pathway were related to the improved stress ability of bn and bj.

clustering of degs
hierarchical cluster analysis of the degs in br, bg, bo, bn, bj, and bc were performed to examine the similarity and diversity of gene expression . all results were displayed by java treeview, where red and green represent the positive and negative values of gene expression, respectively. generally,  <dig> genes with differential expression in br, bg, and bo were clustered as deg intersections . the comparison of br, bg, and bo showed that  <dig> degs were clustered as the union of degs . moreover,  <dig> degs in bn, br, and bo were also clustered , and  <dig> degs differentially expressed in bn and br/bo are listed in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig> degs in bj, br, and bg were also clustered , and  <dig> degs differentially expressed in bj and br/bg are listed in additional file  <dig>  in addition,  <dig> degs in bc, bg, and bo were clustered , and  <dig> degs differentially expressed in bc and bg/bo are listed in additional file  <dig>  the functional categories of these degs showed similar enrichment patterns for each comparison, including categories of metabolism, development, cellular transport, and interaction with the environment . genes with binding function were enriched in each comparison, which is different from previous reports  <cit> .figure  <dig>

analysis of methyltransferase genes differentially expressed in brassica
epigenetic variation has an important function in the evolution of plants. dna methylation is included in this variation and has received much attention in previous years. proteins such as methyltransferase are considered important for plant methylation  <cit> . thus, the putative methyltransferase and methylase genes from all degs in each comparison were filtered to understand the mechanism of the changes in dna methylation in brassica . two methyltransferase genes  were differentially expressed in br, bg, and bo, and  <dig> genes exhibited differential expression in br vs. bo/bg vs. bo/bg vs. br. one methyltransferase gene  was differentially expressed in bn, br, and bo, and  <dig> genes exhibited differential expression in br vs. bn/bo vs. bn/br vs. bo. five methyltransferase genes  were differentially expressed in bj, br, and bg, and  <dig> genes exhibited differential expression in br vs. bj/bg vs. bj/bg vs. br. three methyltransferase genes  were differentially expressed in bc, bg, and bo, and  <dig> genes exhibited differential expression in bg vs. bc/bo vs. bc/bg vs. bo. the results showed that bra <dig> was significantly down-regulated in br compared with bg/bo, which was up-regulated in bn compared with br and down-regulated in bn compared with bo. the expression of bra <dig> in bj was higher than in br and lower than in bg. the expression of this methyltransferase gene in bc was significantly up-regulated than in bg and bo. moreover, bra <dig> was obviously down-regulated in bo compared with br/bg. different expression values were also examined in brassica amphidiploids compared with their ancestral diploid parents. the methyltransferase gene was up-regulated in bn compared with br and bo, which was also up-regulated in bc compared with bg and bo. however, the expression value of bra <dig> in bj was similar to that of br and bg.

non-additive genes expressed in brassica amphidiploids
the expression value of genes in brassica amphidiploids  were compared with the relative mid-parent value  to identify the genes with differential expression pattern. up to  <dig> genes in bn showed differences in expression from mpv,  <dig>  of these genes showed higher expression levels, whereas  <dig>  showed lower expressions than mpv. among the non-additively expressed genes,  <dig>  genes were expressed at higher levels, whereas  <dig>  genes were expressed at lower levels in br than in bo . this finding is similar to the data reported by jiang et al.   <cit> . with regard to bj,  <dig> genes showed differences in expression from mpv,  <dig>  of these genes were expressed higher in br than in bg, and  <dig>  genes were expressed at lower levels. moreover,  <dig> genes in bc showed differences in expression from mpv,  <dig>  of them were expressed higher in bg than in bo, whereas  <dig>  genes were expressed lower. significantly more non-additive genes than additive genes in amphidiploids implied the complicated evolution history of brassica. in this study, no standard rna sample was included in library construction. given that two samples often differ in the total number of transcripts per cell, the differences in transcriptome size, not just the differences in rna yields during extraction, can introduce biases  <cit> . in addition, polyploidization of plant species is a complicated process that is unequal to simple duplication or combination of ancient genomes; fractionation of duplicated genes would result in both gene and genome preferences in stabilized brassica polyploids  <cit> . the challenge to rna-seq is that the transcripts of duplicated genes are difficult to precisely assign to homologous polyploids, especially in the absence of a reference genome  <cit> . mpv is a valid criterion to assess non-additive gene expression changes and functional plasticity in allopolyploids  <cit> . for rna-seq, another shortcoming is that many short reads likely align to identical reference sequences, which may be excluded from transcript counting, thereby affecting the accuracy of estimated gene expression level  <cit> . given the information mentioned above, both the dge and non-additive genes identified in this study might not be as accurate as expected, and thus further verification is necessary.table  <dig>

discussion
differences in gene expression among brassica diploids
global brassica research programs aim to explore valuable information on novel traits and to create stable lines. br, bg, and bo exhibit many valuable agronomic traits including resistance against diseases and stress. these brassica diploids have been suggested to have a triplication history  <cit> . based on the dge data of diploid brassica species, multiple genes exhibited different expressional patterns in br, bg, and bo. moreover,  <dig> genes were expressed in the leaf tissue of all three diploids. in addition,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were uniquely expressed in br, bg, and bo, respectively. however,  <dig> degs were differently expressed among brassica diploids including genes that encode proteins with binding function, transmembrane transporter, glycosyltransferase , acyltransferase , and methyltransferase . different copies of homologs in a, b, and c brassica genomes and a comparative mapping of brassica have revealed extensive differences among the a, b, and c genomes  <cit> . the transcriptome changes in brassica diploids are possibly due to the polyploid history during species formation. these changes cause different genome dosages and sub-functionalization/neo-functionalization of genes, as well as morphological/physiological differences in br, bg, and bo. this result would facilitate the gene exploration related to species-specific characters, thereby accelerating the breeding of brassica.

gene expression differences among allopolyploids and ancestral diploid progenitors
the expression differences in allotetraploids and diploids were analyzed by comparing the normalized value of genes expressed in each brassica species. the results indicated that a larger number of gene expressional differences were identified between allotetraploids and diploids than among diploids. although  <dig> genes were conserved in bn, br, and bo,  <dig> degs were up-regulated in bn compared with br or bo, and  <dig> degs were down-regulated in bn after natural polyploidization. similarly, degs were also analyzed in bj and bc after polyploidization, and gene expressional changes were considered with parental preference. zhao et al.  also found that the gene expression in brassica hexaploid is more similar to br than to bc  <cit> . in accordance with previous results, a large number of degs in natural bn and br/bo suggests that the gene expression differences in resynthesized bn might be effectively inherited after polyploidization  <cit> . these results indicated that long-term and immediate responses to polyploidization are complicated. genome-biased expression and silencing of genes are also observed in natural and synthetic cotton  <cit> . zhao et al.  suggested that this observation might be due to the interactions of cytoplasm and nuclear genome during polyploidization  <cit> . hitherto, bj and bc have been used for the creation of synthesized brassica allopolyploids   <cit> . however, polyploidization of bj and bc have not been thoroughly studied. given that the b genome possesses valuable agronomic traits including black-leg resistance  <cit> , the study of b-genome evolution during the polyploidization of bj and bc is meaningful to the exploration of b-genome desirable traits. in the present research, many gene expressional differences in bj and bc after polyploidization were explored. the results showed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in bj, br, and bg, including genes that encode acyltransferase and metyltransferase. moreover, the degs in bj and bc after polyploidization were more than that in bn, which is partially due to the lack of a reference genome in this research. the b genome is more diversified than the a and c genomes  <cit> ; hence, some b genome-specific information were neglected during the analysis of dge data. most of the commonly expressed genes in the diploids were non-additively expressed in allotetraploids, which is similar to the non-additive pattern in synthesized bn and arabidopsis  <cit> . the repression and activation of these genes in allotetraploids are responsible for the sub-functionalization of duplicated genes  <cit> , which indicates a more complicated gene expression in allopolyploids rather than a simple combination of two genomes  <cit> . all of these non-additively expressed genes are important in studying the genome polyploidization of brassica. the expressional changes in allotetraploids are necessary for the adjustment to the environment during natural polyploidization  <cit> .

putative methyltransferase genes in brassica allotetraploids
one of the epigenetic variations is dna methylation, which is important to genome activity. plant polyploidization is normally accompanied with various phenotypic changes that are partially induced by new methylation changes during the interaction of different genomes  <cit> . extensive dna methylation differences have been reported in synthesized bn  <cit> . in the present research,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> methyltransferase genes were differentially expressed after the polyploidization of bn, bj, and bc, respectively. the methyltransferase gene bra <dig> was up-regulated in bn compared with br and bo, whereas the expression value of this gene in the early generations of resynthesized bn was lower than that of natural bn  <cit> . this finding implies the complexity of gene activation and silencing mechanism during brassica polyploidization. whether these methylation changes in brassica are responsible for the different expressions of degs in allotetraploids needs to be verified. further research of these genes is important to comprehend the transcriptome changes during brasssica polyploidization.

CONCLUSIONS
the genus brassica includes a group of crops with important economic and nutritional values, and these crops are most closely related to arabidopsis. brassica and arabidopsis have been confirmed to originate from a putative hexaploid ancestor. triplication occurred after the divergence of brassica and arabidopsis to form a genomic complexity of brassica  <cit> . three allopolyploids, which arose from the natural hybridization of a, b, and c genomes, introduced extensive genome reshuffling and gene loss, as well as neo- and sub-functionalization of duplicate genes  <cit> . therefore, the brassica species are taken as an important model for the evolution of polyploids. unfortunately, acknowledging the ancestors of brassica polyploids is difficult, and these tetraploids are suspected to have multiple origins  <cit> . resynthesizing brassica allopolyploids have provided an alternative way to study polyploidization, but the research in this area mainly focused on b. napus  <cit> . an overview of the transcriptome differences among natural brassica species would be interesting to gain initial knowledge on species diversification and polyploidization. this study demonstrated the dge approach in characterizing the transcriptome of brassica diploids and allotetraploids. however, the sampling from each genotype of brassica may not capture the true range of phenotypes that exists within this genus. the degs during the evolution of brassica diploids from a common hexaploid ancestor with arabidopsis were revealed. moreover, the degs in the natural polyploidization of brassica allotetraploids from the hybridization of diploids were determined. future work should concentrate on the function analysis of these degs, particularly stress resistance and methylase genes. analysis should be performed to uncover the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that would result in the phenotypic and physiologic differences among brassica species. elucidation of these differences is important to the discovery and utilization of genes for brassica breeding and to shed light on brassica evolution.
