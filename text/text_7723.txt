BACKGROUND
since microarray technology has become one of the most popular approaches in the field of gene expression analysis, numerous statistical methods have been used to provide insights into the biological mechanisms of gene expression regulation. the high dimension of expression data and the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms leading to transcriptional networks still forces statisticians and bioinformaticians to examine available methods and to develop new sophisticated approaches. however, there are already appropriate methods using different approaches to examine the underlying biological mechanisms determining the gene expression signatures and profiles measured by microarray experiments. supervised methods using prior knowledge like gene set enrichment analysis  deliver useful results under certain conditions. but there is still a lack of reliable data needed for non-classical analysis. widely used unsupervised approaches, like hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering, use correlations or other distance or similarity measures to identify genes with similar behavior under similar conditions. but these methods are not able to represent more complex structures and interdependencies in the regulatory machinery.

in contrast to the algorithms mentioned above, independent component analysis  explores higher-order statistics to decompose observed gene expression signatures , which form the rows of the input data matrix, into statistically independent gene expression modes , which form the rows of matrix s according to the data model xt = as. ica solves blind source separation  problems, where it is known that the observed data set represents a linear superposition of underlying independent source signals. but it can more generally be considered a matrix decomposition technique which extracts informative features from multivariate data sets like, for example, biomedical signals like eeg   <cit> , meg   <cit>  and fmri   <cit>  recordings. ica can also be considered a projective subspace technique appropriate for noise reduction  <cit> , or artifact removal  <cit>  if generated from independent sources.

in this work we will concentrate on the linear case, in which each single microarray ges is considered a linear superposition of unknown statistically independent gem. to decompose these mixtures into statistically independent components, ica algorithms like fastica or jade have been used. typically, these gems can be interpreted as being characteristic of ongoing, largely independent biological regulatory processes. the philosophy behind can be expressed as: co-expression means co-regulation. but the complexity of gene regulation and the various interactions of cellular processes demands a new interpretation of our ica-derived components. in the following we use these extracted gems to generate sub-modes, which may provide biological pathway information. the genes contained in these pathway-associated sub-modes can be regarded as more or less self-contained parts of larger regulatory networks, which can be represented by combining these sub-modes into meta-modes according to the functional role of the associated genes.

here we used m-csf dependent in vitro differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages as a model process to demonstrate that ica is a useful tool to support and extend knowledge-based strategies and to identify complex regulatory networks or novel regulatory candidate genes.

the major known pathways associated to m-csf receptor dependent signaling  <cit>  include expansion of the role of the map-kinase pathway  <cit>  and jun/fos, jak/stat and pi- <dig> kinase  <cit>  dependent signal transduction. up-regulation of immune-regulatory components involved in innate immunity response , specific   <cit>  and nonspecific   <cit>  opsonin receptors as well as charge and motif pattern recognition receptors   <cit> , is characteristic for monocyte/macrophage differentiation. beyond this, an increase of membrane biogenesis, vesicular trafficking and metabolic pathways including amino acids, glucose, fatty acids and sterols, as well as increased activity of lysosomal hydrolases that enhance phagocytotic function  <cit> , autophagy  <cit>  and recycling is triggered through m-csf signaling as a hallmark of innate immunity  <cit> . these mechanisms are tightly coupled to changes in cytokine/chemokine response  <cit>  and red/ox signaling  that drive chemotaxis migration, inflammation , apoptosis  and survival  <cit> .

RESULTS
m-csf dependent monocyte to macrophage differentiation involves the activation and regulation of many different cellular pathways. in this study we used several microarray experiments and combined them to a data set, which we analyzed using the jade algorithm. the extracted gems were labeled from  <dig> to  <dig>  according to decreasing energy. note that the extracted gems show positive as well as negative components. they are partitioned into a sub-mode containing the negative signals only, denoted by i. <dig>  and a corresponding sub-mode of the positive signals, denoted by i. <dig>  respectively. these sub-modes were then combined into so-called meta-modes according to the following super categories deduced from the mesh-filter used: apoptosis, signal transduction, cell cycle and regulatory sequences, see table. sub-classification and mapping to distinct pathways was then performed with the extracted sub-modes using the bibliosphere mesh- and geneontology-filter tools. note that our method not only takes into account that one gene can be part of more than one pathway, but also that one pathway can be involved in more than one cellular event. this cannot be achieved with classical clustering tools.

signal transduction
within the meta-mode signal transduction four sub-modes,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were combined together. the map-kinase pathway  could be identified as the major signal transduction pathway in sub-modes  <dig>  and  <dig> . sub-mode  <dig>  encompassed the functions signal transduction and cell communication. the remaining sub-mode  <dig>  could not be mapped to a defined pathway, but the majority of genes within this sub-mode are associated with innate immunity and defense functions. among these we identified relevant genes, also related to signal transduction, like cd <dig>  blnk. the transcription factors lmo <dig> and fli <dig> were unique in sub-mode  <dig>  whereas mmp <dig>  cd <dig>  ctsk, c1qr <dig> and mycl <dig> as a tf were also present in several other sub-modes.

the  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, identified mapk-pathway genes were all unique within their sub-modes , except il <dig> and dusp <dig>  which were present in both sub-modes. il <dig> is a member of the cxc chemokine family and thus one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. it is also a potent angiogenic factor and has a signalling function in the fas-pathway, whereas dusp <dig> is assumed to play an important role in the human cellular response to environmental stress, as well as in the negative regulation of cellular proliferation. another central gene of the mapk-pathway is caspase- <dig> , which was represented in sub-mode  <dig>  . caspase- <dig> is responsible for the maturation of the multi-functional cytokine interleukin-1Î² and as member of the fas caspase cascade it is involved in fas mediated cell death  <cit> . further remarkable genes associated with map-kinase in this sub-mode were s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  gadd45b, ctsk, sod <dig> and the transcription factors junb and atf <dig>  since they were all represented in other sub-modes or pathways, or play a central role in the mapk-pathway.

jak/stat
sub-mode  <dig>  combined the mapk-pathway with the thioredoxin  reductase/thioredoxin system. trx is involved in a variety of oxidation reduction reactions that regulate cell growth and survival decisions  <cit> . it reduces ligand binding and dna interaction by oxidizing cysteine residues within the dna binding domain of glucocorticoid hormone receptors. furthermore, txndc <dig> and txnrd <dig> were found in this sub-mode. trx also seems to be up-regulated by ngf through mapk <dig>  <cit> . other genes associated with the mapk-pathway were: stk17a, sh3bp <dig>  rps6ka <dig>  cd <dig>  g6pd, il1rn and the transcription factors egr <dig> 

in sub-mode  <dig>  all of the  <dig> genes involved in signal transduction were also related to the mesh-term cell communication. five of those signalling genes cflar, txndc <dig>  ywhaz, notch <dig> and psen <dig> were also involved in the negative regulation of cell death.

regulatory sequences
the mesh-term regulatory sequences is described as nucleic acid sequences involved in gene expression regulation. this meta-mode combines genes mapped to the tp53-pathway  and genes related to the oncogenes jun/fos , which are members of a family of transcription factors containing the basic-region-leucine zipper or bzip motif. the bibliosphere software did not define a specific pathway for sub-mode  <dig> , but there were a couple of peptidases and proteinases like lyz, ggh and cpm as well as a remarkable number of classical targets for the srebp transcription factors, regulating cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism: sqle, cyp51a <dig>  hmgcr, fdft <dig>  insig <dig>  idi <dig>  sc5dl and ldlr.

sub-mode  <dig>  represented an intersection of genes involved in gene expression regulation and the tp <dig> pathway. genes which fulfill both criteria were adm, ccnd <dig>  cd <dig>  cdc <dig>  dusp <dig>  gadd45a, gch <dig>  ier <dig>  ndufv <dig>  pim <dig>  slc2a <dig> and ube3a. moreover, sub-mode  <dig>  received high significance values  for the three other meta-mode categories and was also the sub-mode with the highest amount of genes represented in other sub-modes as well. this can be interpreted as an evidence for the complex and networked nature of gene expression regulation and the interactivity of cellular pathways.

the transcription factor jun also known as c-jun belongs to the family of c-jun n-terminal kinases  which are important for development and survival of macrophages  <cit> . sub-modes  <dig>  and  <dig>  combined twelve genes with a known relationship to the jun/fos pathway: ccnd <dig>  crem, cxcl <dig>  gadd45a, il1rn, jun, mapk <dig>  marcks, rala, plau, s100a <dig> and sod <dig> 

differentiation, cell cycle
the meta-mode cell cycle was completely governed by the tp <dig> pathway. although all three sub-modes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  represented tp <dig> related genes, the intersection of genes was marginal. only the genes dusp <dig>  pcna and prkca were mapped to the tp <dig> pathway and were also present in the sub-modes  <dig>  and  <dig> . sub-mode  <dig>  represented genes specialized in cell cycle pathways regulating the interphase and in particular the g <dig> phase, since it contained the genes ppp1r15a, dut, cd <dig>  cdkn1a and smc4l <dig>  sub-modes  <dig>  and  <dig>  mainly represented genes involved in cell growth and proliferation.

sub-mode  <dig>  was characterized by the tp <dig> related genes dhfr, vcan, app, eif2ak <dig> and the transcription factor hmgb <dig> and hmgb <dig>  here, the latter has not been mapped to tp <dig> pathway but is mentioned here because of its strong relation to hmgb <dig> 

the unique tp <dig> genes in sub-mode  <dig>  were: camk <dig>  ctsb, gstn <dig>  nme <dig>  hmgcr, gsn, cyp51a <dig> and il1rn.

survival/apoptosis
apoptosis related pathways play a major role during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. here we introduce the term "survival/apoptosis" for the mesh term apoptosis, because the identified apoptosis pathways here function as survival mechanisms for the differentiating cells. it has been shown, that an absence of m-csf induces apoptosis in cultivated monocytes  <cit> . since apoptosis is regulated through many different pathways and regulatory mechanisms, we could identify seven sub-modes  related to apoptosis. these could be classified to four different pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis: tp <dig> pathway, bax pathway, fas-pathway and calreticulin  regulated apoptosis. three of these sub-modes represented only one pathway. sub-modes  <dig> ,  <dig>  were mapped to the tp <dig> pathway and sub-mode  <dig>  is governed by calr regulated apoptosis, whereas the others could be mapped to more than one pathway.

due to the strongly networked nature of biological regulatory mechanisms, a lot of genes involved in more than one pathway can be regarded as connections between those. toshiyuki and reed  <cit>  showed that the human bax-gene is directly regulated by tp <dig> , whereas bax is participating in the regulation of endoplasmatic reticulum ca2+  <cit>  as well. in this way it acts as a gateway for selected apoptotic signals. this was represented by the sub-modes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  which could comparably be mapped to the tp <dig> and bax pathway. sub-mode  <dig>  here combined the most interesting combination of genes. the genes ccl <dig>  ccnd <dig>  paics, fyb, akab <dig>  il1rn, cxcl <dig>  mt1a and the tfs egr <dig> and atf <dig> could be implicated with bax. these genes overlapped with five of the seven genes mapped to the tp <dig> pathway: atf <dig>  bax, cspg <dig>  eif5b and il1rn. furthermore, the metallo-thioneins which are suggested to regulate dna binding activity of tp <dig>  mt1a, mt1f, mt1b and mt1x were represented in this sub-mode  <cit> .

the role of calr as a major ca2+-binding  protein in the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum is well known  <cit> . consequently, one might imagine that calr is involved in the regulation of apoptotic signals. the following genes of sub-mode  <dig>  are related to calr: slc11a <dig>  cd <dig>  procr, nme <dig> and atp2b <dig>  all of these genes, except atp2b <dig>  passed the mesh-filter apoptosis. the link to the tp <dig> pathway is the transcription factor foxo1a  and prkcb <dig>  which is also involved in various other cellular signaling pathways.

the member of the tnf-receptor superfamily fas plays a central role in the regulation of programmed cell death. sub-mode  <dig>  contained eleven genes related to fas: gstm <dig>  ralgds, alox <dig>  vcan, s100a <dig>  s100a <dig>  vil <dig>  ly <dig>  stab <dig>  hebp <dig> and cd <dig> 

otherwise classified
although not all sub-modes could be mapped to specific meta-modes, the remaining sub-modes still provide useful information. while the genes sorted to sub-modes  <dig>  and  <dig>  deliver no significant pathway information, they share common behavior. genes of sub-mode  <dig>  were all down-regulated in macrophages or up-regulated in monocytes, respectively, whereas genes of sub-mode  <dig>  were up-regulated in macrophages. among these, known marker-genes for the different cell types could be identified: mnda, fcn <dig> and the s <dig> calcium binding proteins s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> as monocyte and igf2r, tspan <dig>  mmp <dig>  ctsk, mmd, tns <dig> and calr as macrophage genes.

furthermore, the sub-modes  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  contained major histocompatibility class  genes. whereas the sub-mode  <dig>  genes hla-a and hla-c belong to mhc class i, the mhc genes of the three other sub-modes belong to mhc class ii which are: hla-dqb <dig>  hla-dqa <dig>  hla-dpb <dig>  hla-dpa <dig> and hla-dmb.

additional meta-mode tables are shown in additional file  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
it has been stated  <cit>  that the use of ica for the analysis of gene expression data is a promising tool, but there is still a lack of a careful discussion of the results. here we emphasized the exploration of the biological relevance and obtained a detailed insight into the networked structure of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. two map kinase related pathways could be identified as the main regulatory pathways during differentiation: the classical map kinase pathway and the jnk and p <dig> map kinase pathway, see figure  <dig>  these results confirm expectations, according to which the map kinase pathway is activated by the m-csf stimulus and functions as the main signal transduction pathway triggering macrophage differentiation and related pathways.

the conspicuous presence of tp <dig> associated pathways in m-csf induced monocyte differentiation is associated with a dramatic regulation of cell-cycle and apoptosis related genes. this leads to the assumption that human mononuclear phagocytes, which are considered to be arrested to non-proliferating cells, still preserve proliferative potential  <cit> .

furthermore, we could show that ica is able to distinguish between monocytes and macrophages concerning differential gene expression. this helpful attribute can be used to find specific marker genes not only for different cell types as it is shown here, but also for different tissues or normal and tumor cells.

moreover, we were able to identify different regulatory mechanisms during m-csf dependent differentiation. although signal transduction pathways are mainly regulated by protein modifications like phosphorylation or acetylation, genes associated to specific pathways involved in macrophage differentiation could be separated into sub-modes only by analyzing gene expression signatures and their related gene expression modes. furthermore, this analysis could be improved by combining gene expression sub-modes extracted from different microarray experiments into informative gene expression meta-modes. the results are in full agreement with the experimental literature on m-csf dependent differentiation  <cit>  and illustrate the potential power of such information-theory-based, unsupervised and data-driven analysis methods, see figure  <dig> 

to fully explore the potential of such information-theory-based unsupervised analysis tools and especially to determine the suitability and reliability of ica for the analysis of microarray datasets, further investigations are needed. the algorithms still suffer from the fact, that the number of estimated independent components, i.e. the extracted gene expression modes, depends on the number of available gene expression signatures and the dimension of the related gene expression profiles. therefor, the availability of greater datasets should lead to advancements, and as shown here, greater datasets can be obtained by the careful combination of smaller datasets.
