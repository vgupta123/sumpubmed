BACKGROUND
with continuous usage of antibiotics overtime, pathogenic bacteria buildup resistance, and this is a major drawback for the treatment of a plethora of bacterial infections. hence, there is an increasing need for antimicrobial agents with novel mechanisms of action, which target essential cellular metabolic processes and pathways. in order to combat recalcitrant pathogens, essential targets for viability, growth and pathogenicity must be identified  <cit> .

antimicrobial peptides  are a class of antimicrobial agents that have been of interest, and they are considered to be a potential substitute for conventional antibiotics  <cit> . amps are a group of bactericidal molecules of the innate immune system in multicellular organisms and in unicellular organisms, represses competing species  <cit> . cationic amps are small positively charged amphipathic peptides; having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends, which enable the molecules to be soluble in aqueous medium and to penetrate lipid-rich membranes of bacterial cells. it is well established that electrostatic attraction between the positively-charged antimicrobial peptides   <cit>  and the highly negative-charged bacterial membrane enables the first step of attachment of the peptide to the bacteria  <cit> . the negative charge is due to composition of the membranes of bacteria, which is different from eukaryotic cells. this difference partially explains the sensitivity of bacterial cells to amps and the lack of toxicity to eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

although the exact mechanisms of action of amps are not fully understood, several have been proposed, such as the interaction of amps with membranes in the carpet, toroid and barrel-stave models  <cit>  causing membrane damage. additionally, other mechanisms of action have been attributed to the integration of amps into the cytoplasmic membrane. however, membrane perturbation/depolarization alone may not be sufficient to cause cell death by cationic amps, as reported for gramicidin s action against p. aeruginosa  <cit> . furthermore, there is a gap in studies addressing the interaction of amps with essential genes involved in cellular metabolism and membrane biosynthesis genes.

p. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium and one of the most important clinical opportunistic pathogens. it is a persistent pathogen associated with nosocomial infections  <cit> , wound infections  <cit> , urinary tract infections   <cit> , otitis media, nasal infections  <cit>  acute and chronic lung infections in artificially ventilated  <cit>  and cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit> . p. aeruginosa infection is difficult to eradicate completely, especially in cf patients, in whom, infection results in decreased lung function and uncontrolled inflammation  <cit> . it continues to pose a therapeutic problem due to drug resistance developing during therapy, caused by low permeability of its outer membrane, multi-drug efflux pumps and ampc β-lactamases  <cit>  resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality. additionally, during the initial colonization of p. aeruginosa, the non-mucoid phenotype is the dominant phenotype, however, as the infection progresses there is a switch to a more persistent mucoid phenotype  <cit> . this conversion results from the production of a large quantity of alginate  <cit> , which is followed by the formation of a protected biofilm of micro-colonies  <cit> , resulting in persistent infections  <cit> , poor prognosis of infected patients and mortality and morbidity in cf patients. the mucoid state also enables p. aeruginosa to elude opsonization, phagocytosis, and digestion by host defense mechanisms  <cit> .

in this study, the antimicrobial activity of a novel antimicrobial peptide tp <dig> was investigated against a mucoid and a non-mucoid strain of p. aeruginosa. we assessed its effect on membrane biogenesis, peptidoglycan-associated genes and on essential genes of p. aeruginosa in order to determine the possible mechanisms of action of amps.

methods
bacterial cultures and reagents
p. aeruginosa strains atcc  <dig> and atcc  <dig> used in this study were purchased from the american type culture collection . cation-adjusted mueller hinton broth  was used to grow the bacteria for determination of in-vitro antimicrobial activity and time-kill assays. luria-bertani medium  was used for the membrane-depolarization assay and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction  analysis. todd-hewitt medium  supplemented with yeast extract  was used to grow the bacteria for scanning electron microscopy  and transmission electron microscopy . gentamicin sulphate and polymyxin b were purchased from fisher scientific .

antimicrobial peptide tp359
the proprietary antimicrobial peptide  tp <dig>  was synthesized with > 95 % purity by therapeutic peptides inc., . the structure of tp <dig> was predicted de novo by converting the peptide sequence to its tertiary structure using pepstr; a method for tertiary structure prediction of small bioactive peptides  <cit> . tp <dig> was one of several proprietary amps from therapeutic peptides inc. that was screened for antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa . tp <dig> showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa and thus was selected for further studies.

bactericidal assay
we evaluated the bactericidal activity of tp <dig> against p. aeruginosa by first determining the minimum inhibitory concentration . tp <dig> was serially diluted 2-fold starting at  <dig> to 0 μg/ml and added into non-treated polystyrene 96-well plates, according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute  m7-a <dig> method  <cit>  as previously described  <cit> . each well was next inoculated with 20 μl  of either strain of p. aeruginosa in ca-mhb to a final concentration of approximately 1 × 105 cfu/ml. bacteria alone served as positive control to verify bacteria growth, while negative control wells contained only media to ascertain culture sterility. to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration   <cit>  we used tp <dig> at two or three concentrations higher than its mic. the bacteria concentrations were then plated on luria agar  plates and viable cfu/ml counts were enumerated by plate count assay.

time-kill studies
the time-kill studies of tp <dig> against both strains of p. aeruginosa were performed as we recently reported  <cit> , according to the m26-a guidelines of the clsi  <cit> . either p. aeruginosa strains  were inoculated into non-treated polystyrene 96-well plates containing tp <dig> concentrations correlating to their respective mics . viable cell counts were determined after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h of incubation at 37 °c by plate count assay.

toxicity of the peptide to eukaryotic cell lines
cell lines used in this study were the human lung carcinoma epithelial a <dig> cell line  and the mouse j <dig> macrophage cell line . a <dig> was used because p. aeruginosa is known to infect the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis  patients, while macrophages are the first line of defense during infection. the a <dig> and j <dig> cell lines were cultured in f-12k medium  and dulbecco’s modified eagle medium , respectively supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum  and 1 % 100× antibiotic-antimycotic . the cytotoxic effect of tp <dig> on cell lines  was determined using the cell-titer 96® non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit  as previously described  <cit> .

membrane permeabilization assay
the effect of tp <dig> on outer membrane integrity of p. aeruginosa was analyzed using the live/dead baclighttm viability kit l <dig>  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. overnight cultures of bacteria were inoculated into thy and grown at 37 °c to an optical density of  <dig>   before being exposed to 4× mic for 4 h. negative cultures included those without added peptide. cultures were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, washed, further incubated in 1 ml of  <dig>  % nacl for 1 h and then finally re-suspended in 200 μl of  <dig>  % nacl. bacteria cells were then incubated in the dark for 45 min in a 2x stock solution of the baclight staining reagent containing a final concentration of 6 μm syto  <dig> and 30 μm of propidium iodide. images were captured using a nikon eclipse te <dig> microscope  using fitc-hyq  and tritc hyq  filters.

membrane depolarization assay
cytoplasmic membrane depolarization was determined using the fluorescent dye  <dig> -dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide  as described  <cit>  with some modifications. exponential-phase bacteria at approximately 1 × 109 cfu/ml in buffer  were incubated in  <dig>  mm disc <dig> . after this, kcl  was added to equilibrate the cytoplasmic and external k+ concentration followed by addition of bacterial suspension with either peptide, polymyxin b or gentamicin sulphate to optiplate 96-well white plates  for concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 80 μm. the fluorescence intensity was measured by using the hidex plate chameleon v  with an excitation wavelength of 622 nm and emission wavelength of 670 nm.

scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis 
sem and tem analyses of untreated- and tp359-treated exponential-phase bacteria  were performed essentially as previously described  <cit> . bacteria were exposed to approximately 4× mic for 4 h at 37 °c prior to analyses.

peptide effect on essential genes of p. aeruginosa
to determine the effect of tp <dig> on p. aeruginosa genes essential for viability, cellular metabolism, pathogenicity, outer membrane biosynthesis and assembly , were analyzed using qrt-pcr under bacteriostatic and bactericidal conditions. the bacteriostatic condition is indicated by bacterial recovery after 18 h of tp <dig> treatment, whereas at the bactericidal condition which causes cell death; samples were treated for a shorter time, to avoid complete cell death. p. aeruginosa at 1 × 105 cfu/ml were exposed to  <dig> × mic of tp <dig> and grown for 18 h in a shaker incubator at 37 °c to evaluate the bacteriostatic effects of tp <dig>  for the bactericidal condition, p. aeruginosa at 1 × 109 cfu/ml were exposed to 4× mic of tp <dig> and grown for 4 h, and subsequently for  <dig> and  <dig> mins to compare the effect at these time period to the bacteriostatic  <dig> h treatment condition. also, ​p. aeruginosa at 1 ×  <dig> cfu/ml were exposed to 4× mic of gentamicin and grown for  <dig> h for control. total rna samples from both conditions were purified using an rneasy mini kit , and quantified using a spectrophotometer . the cdna synthesis was carried out using the applied biosystems high capacity cdna reverse transcriptase kit . one microgram of rna was used to amplify selected key outer membrane biogenesis , cell division  and virulence  genes of p. aeruginosa using the applied biosystems viia 7tm real time pcr system . primer pairs for each gene are shown in table  <dig>  the amplification conditions used were one cycle of initial denaturation at 95 °c for 2 min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95 °c for 15 s, 56 °c for 25 s and 72 °c for 30s. the relative changes in gene expression were calculated using the equation: 2−ΔΔct  <cit>  where all values were normalized with respect to mrna levels of the house-keeping gene, rpod. fold changes in mrna gene expression levels were calculated relative to untreated bacteria samples. each real-time pcr assay was performed in triplicate from three independent experiments and the results are expressed as the mean ± sd.table  <dig> genes and product function

RESULTS
peptide characterization
characterization of tp <dig> revealed that it is rich in the hydrophilic amino acid residue lysine, and has a net charge of + <dig>  grand average hydropathy value of tp <dig> was − <dig> , indicating its hydrophilic nature, and hence its solubility in water. the tp <dig> peptide extends hydrophilic amino acids arginine , and lysine  residues towards the sides, and lys <dig> towards the bottom  . the hydrophilic amino acid lys contributes the positive charge to the peptide while arg <dig>  lys <dig>  lys <dig> and lys <dig> make it readily soluble. the non-polar amino acids at the n- terminal  are followed by a polar positively charged region . the c-terminal has positively charged polar lys8; the polar, hydrophilic patches are bridged by aliphatic non-polar ala <dig> and leu <dig> residues. the polar and non-polar features  and the three-dimensional structure analyses show that the peptide may possess the ability to penetrate the cell membrane.fig.  <dig> in silico analysis of tp <dig> a structure of tp359; b three-dimensional structure and surface development of the peptide. the amino acids are represented as per the hydrophobicity; c electrostatic influence of the peptide  shown in blue 



tp <dig> is bactericidal against p. aeruginosa
our results show that tp <dig> was highly effective in preventing the growth of p. aeruginosa. the peptide exhibited mics as low as  <dig> and 8 μg/ml and mbcs of  <dig> and 64 μg/ml, respectively against the mucoid and non-mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa. these values are consistent with the mic range of another cationic peptide, ec <dig> for a different strain of p. aeruginosa   <cit> . the positive controls, polymyxin b and gentamicin sulphate displayed mics between  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml . time-kill studies were performed to determine the time-frame required for the effective killing of p. aeruginosa by tp <dig>  our results showed a ≥ <dig> log cfu/ml within 8 h at 4× the mic and a 5-log reduction of the viable cell count within 2 h at 8× mic for the mucoid strain . also for the non-mucoid strain, the viable cell count decreased by ≥ <dig> log cfu/ml within 3 h at 8× mic . these results demonstrate that tp <dig> is bactericidal against p. aeruginosa and that its bactericidal activity is dose- and time-dependent.table  <dig> antimicrobial susceptibility of p. aeruginosa

cytotoxic activity
given the potential consideration of tp <dig> as a therapeutic agent against p. aeruginosa, it was necessary to examine its toxicity to the human-lung carcinoma epithelial a <dig> and mouse j <dig> macrophage cell lines. our results revealed that none of the tested concentrations  had toxic effects against a <dig> cells over a 48 h-time-frame . tp <dig> was nontoxic to j <dig> macrophages at lower concentrations but at higher concentrations cells remained viable up to 85 %  and  . overall, our data suggest the safety of the peptide for potential in vivo studies.fig.  <dig> cytotoxicity of peptide tp <dig>  human lung carcinoma epithelial a <dig> cells , and mouse j <dig> macrophages cells  were seeded in  <dig> well microtiter plates, and allowed to attach overnight before being exposed to the various peptide concentrations  for  <dig> and 48 h. fifteen microliter of mtt dye were then added to each well and plates were subsequently incubated for 4 h before adding 100 μl of the solubilizing/stop solution and read at a wavelength of 570 nm. this data is a representative of three separate experiments and significance was established at *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig> 



membrane permeabilization
to begin to understand the antimicrobial mechanisms of tp <dig>  membrane permeabilization was studied using the live/dead stain kit, consisting of the syto <dig> and propidium iodide  dyes. the syto <dig> labeled all cells  green, while only damaged membranes were labelled red by pi. the percentage of cells with damaged membranes was then calculated relative to the total number of cells at different spots in different samples . these data showed that tp <dig> is effective at permeabilizing the membranes of both strains, as the percentages of damaged membranes for both strains were ≥80 % for the treated samples, in contrast to ≤20 % for the untreated samples.fig.  <dig> membrane permealization. p. aeruginosa cells were exposed to 4× mic of tp <dig> for 4 h. cultures were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, pellets were washed, incubated and re-suspended in  <dig>  % nacl. cells were then incubated in the dark for 45 min in a 2× stock solution of the baclight staining reagent before fluorescence was captured by the nikon eclipse te <dig>  a and d show untreated mucoid and non-mucoid p. aeruginosa, respectively; b and e show tp <dig> treated mucoid and non-mucoid p. aeruginosa, respectively. images are representatives of separate experiments. for c and f random portions were selected for both treated and untreated samples using the nis element  <dig>  software and counted before extrapolating the percentage of damaged membranes in the mucoid and non-mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa, respectively. this data is a representative of three separate experiments and significance was established at *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig> 



membrane depolarization
since results from membrane permeabilization assay indicate om permeabilization, we sought to investigate if there is a breach of the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane. this was performed using the disc <dig> dye which crosses the outer membrane of the bacterial cells and concentrates at the cytoplasmic membrane. upon addition of membrane permealization agent, the dye is released into the surrounding medium, and the fluorescence intensity is measured relative to the amount of dye released. tp <dig> induced membrane depolarization in both strains at  <dig> to 80 μm was evidenced by the release of the dye. the positive polymyxin b control also induced membrane depolarization at those concentrations, while the negative gentamicin control failed to induce membrane depolarization . these data show that tp <dig> depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of p. aeruginosa, which may lead to cytoplasmic membrane damage and killing of bacteria.fig.  <dig> membrane depolarization. exponential phase bacteria of a mucoid p. aeruginosa and b non-mucoid p. aeruginosa were incubated in  <dig>  mm disc <dig> . bacterial suspensions and either peptide, polymyxin b or gentamicin sulphate were added to optiplate 96-well to obtain a series of concentrations ranging from  <dig> to 80 μm. fluorescence intensity was measured at baseline  and after 30 min of incubation . increase in fluorescence intensity was then obtained by subtracting the fi from ff.. this experiment was carried out in triplicate and significance was established at *p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig> 



tp <dig> induced structural changes and damage to the membrane of p. aeruginosa
we next used electron microscopy to begin to understand how tp <dig> kills p. aeruginosa. our sem images revealed that the tp359-treated mucoid cell population had punctured membranes, efflux of intracellular material, as well as disintegrated and agglomerated cells. ruptured cell debris was also evident , while bacteria without tp <dig> had smooth cell morphology . the non-mucoid tp359-treated cell population also showed similar changes; cells were disintegrated, with evidence of damages on the membrane  as compared to the untreated cells . tem similarly showed treated cells with compromised membranes and efflux of cytoplasmic contents proceeding into ghost cells . both sem and tem results established a possible mechanism of action, whereby tp <dig> interacts with the cell membrane causing membrane permeabilization and degradation, with resulting changes in cell morphology. these results indicate that tp <dig> caused loss of membrane structure resulting in morphological changes and cell death.fig.  <dig> scanning electron microscopy . tp359- treated and untreated mucoid and non-mucoid strains of p. aeruginosa, exposed to  <dig> × mic of peptide and grown for  <dig> h, fixed in glutaraldehyde/paraformaldehyde, treated with osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and sputter coated before sem. panels a and d show images of untreated mucoid and non-mucoid cells respectively. bacterial cells have intact cell membranes with uniform shape, while panels b and c show ruptured cells, with debris evident in peptide treated mucoid cells, and panels e and f show peptide treated non-mucoid bacterial cells. treated samples show cell disintegration , pores on cell membranes, upturned cells , and eruption of intra-cellular materials

tp <dig> effect on essential genes and protein expression of p. aeruginosa
selected critical genes involved in outer membrane biogenesis, peptidoglycan synthesis, cell division and virulence were analyzed to determine the molecular effect of tp <dig> against both strains of p. aeruginosa . as shown, tp <dig> did not significantly alter expression of genes associated with cell division  or virulence  under either bacteriostatic or bactericidal concentrations . contrastingly, tp <dig> perturbed the expression of p. aeruginosa membrane genes  under bacteriostatic or bactericidal concentrations . most notably, under bacteriostatic concentrations there was marked upregulation of the opri gene  that is essential for membrane integrity in mucoid and non-mucoid strains. examinations of the genes perturbed under bactericidal concentrations revealed a consistent and significant down-regulation of the opri and oprf genes . as shown, there was a 5-fold decrease in the expression of the opri gene for both strains. however, the most notable effect of tp <dig> was on the oprf gene , where a significant 10- and 5-fold reductions in its expression was observed for the mucoid and non-mucoid strains, respectively. this important finding shows the effect of tp <dig> on the oprf gene, which may suggest that disruption of membrane integrity, could contribute to bacterial cell death. moreover, this result strongly supports the findings of the sem and tem analysis, where tp359-treated cells show flaccid membranes, compared to the untreated control cells. additionally, p. aeruginosa exposed to tp <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> mins showed no significant changes when compared to the untreated, indicating that a longer period of treatment was required to evaluate tp <dig> effect on these genes . also, p. aeruginosa exposed to gentamicin showed no significant changes when compared to the tp <dig> treated samples, suggesting that tp <dig> effect was not merely due to stress . fig.  <dig> quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . p. aeruginosa at 1 × 105 cfu/ml and 1 × 109 cfu/ml were either untreated for control, or treated with  <dig> × and 4× the mic of tp <dig> and then grown for  <dig> and 4 h, representing bacteriostatic and bactericidal concentrations, respectively. total rna was extracted, quantified before cdna synthesis using reverse transcriptase, followed by pcr amplification. data obtained from three-independent experiments were used to analyze the relative gene expression by the 2-ΔΔct method. panels a and c show the mucoid and non-mucoid strains for the bactericidal concentration and panels b and d for the bacteriostatic concentration



we confirmed the effect of the peptide on outer membrane proteins by analyzing outer membrane protein fractions of tp359-treated p. aeruginosa using the experiontm automated electrophoresis system  followed by semi-quantification of proteins . as shown in fig.  <dig> a, there was a fully expressed  <dig>  kda oprf protein in both untreated mucoid and non-mucoid p. aeruginosa samples. in contrast, expression was visually absent in the tp359-treated mucoid strain and reduced in the tp359-treated non-mucoid strain samples. this data correlated with our gene expression analysis, where a significant down-regulation of the oprf gene was observed for both strains of p. aeruginosa. the oprl protein expression also was significantly reduced in the tp359-treated samples as compared to the untreated samples for the mucoid  but not the non-mucoid strain , which is congruent with the gene expression results. the opri, with molecular weight less than  <dig> kda was undetectable because its size is below the detection limit for the experiontm automated electrophoresis system.fig.  <dig> evaluation of outer membrane proteins of tp <dig> –treated and untreated p. aeruginosa. p. aeruginosa at 1 × 109 cfu/ml were either untreated for control, or treated with 4× the mic of tp <dig> and grown for 4 h. the omp fraction was extracted and then separated on the experiontm pro <dig> automated electrophoresis system for analysis. panel a show the protein concentrations of oprf and oprl  and b and c represent the mucoid and non-mucoid strains respectively



discussion
the antimicrobial activity and molecular effects of a novel proprietary cationic peptide, tp <dig> were investigated independently against a mucoid and a non-mucoid strain of p. aeruginosa. our results revealed the following:  both strains of p. aeruginosa were sensitive to tp <dig>   tp <dig> showed no toxic effects against human lung epithelial a <dig> and mouse j <dig> macrophage cell lines,  tp <dig> caused membrane damage, as shown by sem, tem, live/dead stain and membrane depolarization assay and  tp <dig> down-regulated p. aeruginosa membrane biogenesis and peptidoglycan synthesis associated genes.

tp <dig> exhibited antimicrobial activity against both strains of p. aeruginosa at mic concentrations, which is in agreement with most cationic amps  <cit> , with comparatively lesser effect on gram-positive strains. it was essentially non-toxic to eukaryotic cells, which is also in agreement with other amps . the lack of toxicity of amps to eukaryotic cells may be due to their membrane composition, which consists of zwitterionic phospholipids that are neutral in net charge  <cit> . this neutral charge reduces electrostatic interaction between the eukaryotic cell membrane and amps, thus increasing their potential for use as antipseudomonal drugs. our investigation into the effect of tp <dig> on the membrane of p. aeruginosa revealed that tp <dig> caused outer membrane permeabilization, which was further illustrated in the tp <dig> sensitivity assay, where bacterial cells were sensitive to tp <dig> , suggesting its effect on cell membrane integrity. generally, the antimicrobial activity of amps is mostly attributed to membrane dysfunction, and cationic amphiphilic amps are electrostatic, which makes them attracted to the negatively charged bacteria membrane surfaces  <cit>  causing membrane damage. results from our sem and tem analyses further confirm this, together with the leaking of cytoplasmic content. these observations suggest that tp <dig> may penetrate the bacterial membrane by electrostatic interaction between tp <dig> and the bacterial cell surface.

although the classic mechanism of action of amps is their ability to cause membrane damage, other mechanisms involve the inhibition of cell wall biogenesis, such as the lantibiotics-class  <dig> bacteriocins, lcn  <dig>  a class  <dig> bacteriocin and nicin  <cit> . another class of peptides which target cell wall biogenesis is the class of endogenous host defense peptides  such as the defensins and cathelicidins  <cit> . some reports also indicate that membrane perturbation alone may not be sufficient to elicit bacterial cell death  <cit> , so we investigated the molecular effect of tp <dig> against selected critical genes involved in membrane biogenesis, peptidoglycan synthesis associated genes, cell division genes and virulence genes.

analysis of tp359-treated cells showed that the transcriptional expression levels of some outer membrane genes were down-regulated at bactericidal concentrations, whereas they were up-regulated at bacteriostatic concentrations in both strains. the most significantly down-regulated gene in both strains at bactericidal concentrations was oprf, which encodes a major structural and outer membrane porin . the reduced translational expression of oprf further underscores its dysregulation by tp <dig>  p. aeruginosa oprf is essential for cell shape, maintenance of peptidoglycan association and structural integrity  <cit>  and also for complete virulence. therefore, a down-regulation of oprf expression, suggests a disruption in the outer membrane of the bacterial cell, which could result into a permeable membrane for foreign materials and water, leading to osmosis and cell lysis. this effect of the peptide on oprf expression indeed correlates with our sem analysis, where tp359-treated cells had a rough shape compared to the untreated cells, indicating defective bacteria membrane integrity. the significance of our findings is further accentuated by the observation that oprf mutants formed poor anaerobic biofilms in the lung of cf patients, and that lung secretions from cf patients with chronic p. aeruginosa infection have increased antibodies to oprf  <cit> , indicating the significance of oprf for persistent infection. hence, based on our findings, we could infer that tp <dig> could disrupt the cellular integrity of p. aeruginosa and increase clearance from cf airways. as a positive control, the effect of gentamicin on the outer membrane genes was investigated at both bactericidal and bacteriostatic condition. although some of the genes were downregulated in both treated strains, they were not statistically significant, suggesting that the effect of tp <dig> on these genes may not be due to stress and could be a contributory factor to its antimicrobial activity.

to our knowledge, our study is the first to comprehensively characterize the antimicrobial effect of a cationic amp at the gene level. based on the novelty of our findings, we propose the possible mechanisms of action of the tp <dig> peptide  which may include: i) direct contact with the bacterial cell surface due to the attraction between the negatively charged bacterial membrane and the positively charged peptide ii) permeabilization of the outer membrane either due to the downregulation of the outer membrane gene oprf, which is essential for maintaining membrane integrity and shape; or the presence of the hydrophilic portion of the peptide, in the hydrophobic rich portion of the bacterial membrane resulting in membrane instability, in addition to other outer membrane biogenesis genes and iii) inner membrane depolarization, through the displacement of membrane charges.fig.  <dig> proposed mechanism of action of tp <dig>  the proposed mechanism of action involves the interaction of the cationic tp <dig> with the outer membrane of p. aeruginosa, which is negatively charged due to lipopolysaccharide , causing membrane permeabilization and depolarization. this causes pores on the membrane resulting in efflux of cytoplasmic content to produce ghost cells. furthermore, tp <dig> also caused down-regulation of outer membrane associated genes such as the acpp, oprl, opri and most importantly the oprf. the protein products, acpp, oprl, opri and oprf are essential for fatty acid biosynthesis, transport of small molecules and structural membrane integrity. the effect of tp <dig> on the oprf gene may disrupt its product, the oprf, which encodes membrane integrity and structure, leading to a compromised membrane and ultimately cell death



CONCLUSIONS
our novel cationic peptide tp <dig> showed antibacterial activity against both strains of p. aeruginosa. tp <dig> also induced significant morphological changes, and reduced expression of outer membranes and peptidoglycan associated genes specifically the oprf gene, suggesting that the oprf gene could be a target for antimicrobial drug development. since the use of polymyxin b to treat p. aeruginosa has been abandoned due to its nephrotoxicity, tp <dig>  which showed low cytotoxicity in vitro, may prove to be a valuable therapeutic alternative, especially for cf patients. further studies would include the study of other cationic amps and verification of their effect on outer membrane biogenesis genes, which could enhance targeted antimicrobial effects. these could lead to in vivo investigations of the antimicrobial activity of tp <dig>
