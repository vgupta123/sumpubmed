BACKGROUND
enterovirus  <dig> , an rna virus of the picornaviridae family, is first recognized from the patients with neurological abnormalities in california in  <dig>  <cit> . it is known to be a causative agent of hand-foot-and-mouth disease , and occasionally its infection would lead to severe complications including encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and acute flaccid paralysis  <cit> . outbreaks of ev <dig> had been reported worldwide during the last decade  <cit> . in taiwan, there was a large epidemic of hfmd in  <dig>  more than  <dig>  cases were reported and the outbreak resulted in  <dig> deaths  <cit> . two years later, there was another outbreak of hfmd with  <dig>  reports and  <dig> deaths . ev <dig> can induce the apoptosis of human glioblastoma cells  <cit> , human microvascular endothelial cells  <cit> , and jurkat cells  <cit> . although it has been demonstrated that the spinal cord and brain stem were the target of ev <dig> infections  <cit> , the infection mechanism, tissue tropism, and the neurovirulence of ev <dig> remain unclear.

in  <dig>  two receptors for ev <dig> were discovered  <cit> . nishimura et al. found that human p-selectin glycoprotein ligand- <dig>  was a functional receptor for ev <dig>  <cit> . yamayoshi et al. reported that scavenger receptor class b <dig>  was cellular receptor for ev <dig>  <cit> . psgl- <dig> is glycosylated with sialyl lewisx epitope, and scarb <dig> is also a highly glycosylated protein. according to these results, cell surface glycans should participate in the infection of ev <dig>  hence, the glycomic factors which contribute to the epidemics of ev <dig> infection have attracted our attention.

carbohydrates expressed on cell surface involve in many physiological and pathological communications by interacting with their corresponding proteins or receptors  <cit> . among these events, cell surface glycan receptors which mediate viral binding and infection were well documented. for instance, jackson et al. indicated that the entry of food-and-mouse disease virus  into cell was initiated by the contact with cell surface heparin sulfate  <cit> . sulfated polysaccharides extracted from sea algae were demonstrated having potential to prevent the infection of viruses including herpes simplex virus , cytomegalovirus , human immunodeficiency virus  and enterovirus  <cit> . lactoferrin, an 80 kda iron binding glycoprotein presented in several mucosal secretions  <cit> , was reported to inhibit interaction between ev <dig> vp <dig> to rd cells  <cit> . in addition, sialic acids were cell surface ligands for many hemagglutinins  or viral proteins  including influenza, parainfluenza, reovirus type <dig>  adenovirus type  <dig>  human rhinovirus  <dig>  human enterovirus type  <dig>  <cit> , coxsackievirus a <dig>  <cit> , and hepatitis a virus  <cit> .

since the role and function of surface glycans in the attachment and infection of ev <dig> is still vague, this paper aims to decipher these issues and figure out the most important glycomic constituents. two ev <dig> susceptible human cell lines, rhabdomyosarcoma cells  and human neuroblastoma cells , are subjected to virus binding assay. cells were pretreated with neuraminidase or α2-3/α2- <dig> sialic acid binding lectins  for revealing the role of cell surface sialic acids during ev <dig> attachment. in addition, fetuin  was subjected to validate the interaction of sialic acids with ev <dig>  the significance of sialylation on scarb <dig> was also evaluated.

RESULTS
role of sialylation in ev <dig> infection
since sialic acids participated in the attachment of many viruses of the picornaviridae family  <cit> , we verified the effects of sialic acids in ev <dig> infection. rd cells pretreated with different units of neuraminidase were subjected to the binding of ev <dig> by elisa, flow-cytometry and real-time pcr assay. we found that the binding of ev <dig> to rd cells decreased dramatically in a dose dependent manner, which was accompanied with the increasing units of neuraminidase treatment . a clear cytopathic effect was also observed along with the decrease of neuraminidase used in ev71-gfp infected rd cells . it should be noted that the expression of cell surface scarb <dig> was nearly the same after neuraminidase treatment .

based on these results, we further investigated the sialic acid linkage preference of ev <dig> by lectin competition assay and carbohydrate solution microarray  <cit> . maa preferentially recognized α2- <dig> linked sialosides and sna specifically interacted with α2- <dig> linked sialosides. as shown in figure  <dig> a-f, preincubation of rd cells with maa or sna reduced the interactions of ev <dig> to rd cells up to 68% in a dose dependent manner. the retarded cytopathic effect also indicated that the replication of ev71-gfp in rd-cells was decreased by lectin treatment . these findings demonstrated that ev <dig> may interact with both α2- <dig> and α2- <dig> linked sialylated glycoproteins on rd cell surface. additionally, the same results and inhibition trends were obtained when we applied the same assays on sk-n-sh cells which were infected with ev <dig>  <dig> .

because it has been reported that lactoferrin, a highly sialylated glycoprotein, can inhibit the infection of ev <dig>  <cit> , we used another highly sialylated glycoprotein to confirm these interactions between ev <dig> with sialic acid. fetuin and asialofetuin were subjected to ev <dig> binding assay. not surprisingly, pretreated cells with fetuin reduced the attachment of ev <dig> to rd cells by 12-14% . these findings encouraged us to identify the carbohydrate ligands for ev <dig> viral particles and vp <dig> protein  by glycan solution microarray. but, unfortunately, none of the binding signals were observed .

characterization of scarb <dig> sialylation in ev <dig> infection
based on these findings, we tried to look deep inside the relationships of sialylation with viral receptor. by using lectin affinity chromatography  which contained maa and sna-agarose beads, we purified sialylated membrane proteins from rd cell membrane extracts. desialylation was performed with neuraminidase on purified glycoproteins to remove sialic acids. the desialylated glycoproteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation assay, in which ev <dig> viral particles were immobilized on protein g agarose beads through anti-ev <dig> antibody. as shown in figure  <dig>  the cellular receptor of ev <dig>  scarb <dig>  was observed in all of the purified and immunoprecipitated protein fractions. because of the neuraminidase treatment, band in lane  <dig> was slightly shifted down. in addition, band in lane  <dig> was slightly shifted up owing to the non-reducing treatment of ev <dig> pulled down fractions. to determine whether sialylation on scarb <dig> contribute to its interaction with ev <dig>  the binding of ev <dig> to recombinant human scarb <dig>  was analyzed by virus overlay protein binding assay . the result showed that desialylation of hscarb <dig> curtailed the binding ability with ev <dig> .

discussion
glycans that expressed on cell surface are involved in cell-cell adhesion, leukocyte rolling, cell-extracellular matrix interaction, and microbes’ infection  <cit> . carbohydrates, especially sialic acids, are also reported as receptors for gram positive or negative bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and plant lectins  <cit> . for example, sialyl lewisx is a ligand for the saba protein of helicobacter pylori <cit> . cholera toxin of vibrio chlolerae specifically binds to the gm <dig> moiety  <cit> . human influenza virus recognizes α2- <dig> sialylated glycans and infects host cells subsequently  <cit> . glycosaminoglycan, such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, are confirmed as antiviral agents in preventing coxsackievirus b <dig> and dengue virus, respectively  <cit> . further, sialic acid is reported as receptors of many picornaviridae viruses  <cit> .

several methods were established to evaluate the attachment and reproduction efficiency of ev <dig>  elisa assay and flow cytometry provided reliable and reproducible results in quantifying bound ev <dig> viral particles on cell surface. the binding and subsequent replication of ev <dig> was detected by measuring the copy number of viral rna by real-time pcr. in addition, the infection and replication of ev <dig> could also be confirmed by observing the fluorescence intensity and cytopathic effects in ev71-gfp infected cells. rd is an ev <dig> highly susceptible cell line which has been applied for viral replication. sk-n-sh cells established from human neuroblastoma were cell model for investigating the ev <dig> caused neuron toxicity. rd and sk-n-sh cells were infected with ev <dig> mp <dig>  and ev <dig>  <dig> , respectively  <cit> .

since glycosylation was a common and significant feature for cellular and functional receptors of ev <dig>  we first investigated the effects of tunicamycin and benzyl-α-galnac  in the binding and infection of ev <dig> to rd cells. both of the inhibitors decreased the binding of ev <dig> to rd cells significantly . we thus investigated whether the terminal sialic acids on cell surface was involved in ev <dig> infection to rd and sk-n-sh cells. we found that the expression of cell surface scarb <dig> was slightly increased after neuraminidase treatment, and neuraminidase treatment reduced virus binding to rd and sk-n-sh cells in a dose-dependent manner. in addition, the replication of virus was decreased because the binding of ev71-gfp to rd cells was reduced after neuraminidase treatment. these results indicated that sialylation on cell surface should be involved in the attachment and infection of ev <dig> 

as long as there are two major glycosidic linkages between sialic acid with galactose, we applied the lectin competition assay to characterize the binding preference of ev <dig> to rd and sk-h-sn cells. not surprisingly, the binding of ev <dig> was restrained by both lectins on rd and sk-h-sn cells. both cell surface α2-3- and α2-6-linked sialosides were participated in the binding of ev <dig> to host cells. the replication of virus was also dropped because the interaction of ev71-gfp to rd cells was blocked by maa or sna. these observations can also be found in the infection of other picornaviridae viruses such as human rhinovirus  <dig>  encephalomyocarditis virus, and hepatitis a virus  <cit> . then, fetuin/asialofetuin blocking assay was performed and the result indicated that sialylated glycoproteins, such as fetuin, lactoferrin and milk proteins, were inhibitors of ev <dig> infection  <cit> . in order to further identify the carbohydrate epitopes for ev <dig> infection, viral particles and recombinant viral capsid protein were subjected to carbohydrate solution microarray analysis. but, we could not observe any positive binding signal for viral particles or recombinant vp <dig> protein. it might be because we don’t have sufficient sialylated epitopes in our microarray library. further investigations are in progress .

to further characterize the role of sialylation on ev <dig> cellular receptor, we isolated cell membrane sialylated glycoproteins by lectin affinity chromatography. lac was a common and useful tool for proteomic and glycomic analysis  <cit> . for instance, butterfield et al. enriched and analyzed abnormal glycoproteins from brain of alzheimer disease patient by using lac  <cit> . alvarez-manilla and colleagues also identified potential glycobiomarkers from embryonic stem cells with lac technology  <cit> . hence, sialylated membrane proteins were purified with maa/sna lectin-agarose column from rd cell membrane extractions. then, the purified glycoproteins were treated with neuraminidase to remove the effect of sialic acid. the desialylated glycoproteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation assay that pulled down proteins specifically interacted with ev <dig>  not surprisingly, scarb <dig> was observed in western blotting of lac purified fraction, neuraminidase treated fraction, as well as the ev <dig> immunoprecipitated fraction. it should be noted that the position of band in lane  <dig>  was inconsistent with band in lane  <dig>  this result may come from sample preparation under non-reducing condition which could not break scarb2-viral protein interactions. these observations prompted us to investigate the binding of ev <dig> to sialylated and desialylated scarb <dig>  by using vopba, we found that recombinant hscarb <dig> lost some of the binding ability to ev <dig> after desialylation. the same phenomenon have been observed by yamayoshi et al who found that the interaction of ev <dig> with recombinant hscarb <dig> was moderately decreased after removing n-glycans from hscarb <dig> by enzymatic hydrolysis  <cit> . taken together, all of the results indicated that the attachment of ev <dig> to cell surface receptor should be assisted with sialic acids.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, we concluded that cell surface sialylation was important for ev <dig> infection to rd and sk-n-sh cells. although the glycan epitopes for ev <dig> was still unclear, these evidences sufficiently supported that sialylation of cell surface glycoproteins could assist the attachment of ev <dig> to host cells. in addition, we also demonstrated that scarb <dig> was a sialylated glycoprotein. interactions between scarb <dig> with ev <dig> were decreased after desialylation. our findings not only demonstrated the important role of sialic acid in ev <dig> infection to rd and sk-n-sh cells, but also opened a new direction for anti-ev <dig> drug discovery. finally, identification and characterization of glycans or proteins which interact with ev <dig> are now in progress.
