BACKGROUND
a number of studies have measured selection in nature in an effort to understand how populations adapt to their environment over time
 <cit> . reviews collating the estimates of selection in natural populations have debated their magnitude, mode and temporal stability
 <cit> . however, generalizations have been limited because many of the studies lacked temporal replication, comprised small sample sizes that reduced their statistical power to detect selection, or measured fitness components instead of total fitness
 <cit> . nonetheless, two patterns that do emerge are that phenotypic selection is often strong enough to cause evolutionary changes in relatively few generations, and that directional selection frequently prevails over stabilizing or disruptive selection
 <cit> . several factors may interact to reduce response to directional selection
 <cit> , including the fact that selection can vary in strength, direction and mode over time
 <cit> .

studies indicate that temporal changes in selection are attributable to variation in environmental and ecological factors, such as changes in climate, sex ratio or density
 <cit> . long-term investigation into patterns of selection provides insight into how phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits is maintained, and how populations adapt to variable environmental conditions
 <cit> . such information also allows predictions on whether and how populations evolve in response to human perturbations, thus facilitating effective conservation and management of exploited species
 <cit> .

salmonid fishes provide an ideal study system to study temporal changes in selection. these species are philopatric; in principle, it is possible to sample an entire population at maturity, and the assessment of lifetime reproductive success can be used to accurately measure selection
 <cit> . also, several life history traits have been shown to be under selection in these species
 <cit> . for example, several studies have demonstrated that return timing in salmon is often linked to fitness and responds to selection
 <cit> . variability in this trait is typically affected by environmental conditions such as rainfall, temperature or flow regime of their natal river, all of which tend to fluctuate annually
 <cit> . despite such fluctuations, however, the earlier return of males to the spawning grounds  is commonly reported in salmonids
 <cit> . this behavior may maximize mating opportunities in males, as females may not be reproductively active later in the season
 <cit> . however, protandrous arrival may not always be beneficial, as its fitness advantages depend on factors such as female availability, the number of competitors present or post-arrival mortality
 <cit> .

body size in salmonids is also an example of a trait that is acted upon by selection and might be linked to fitness
 <cit> . male salmon exhibit high variability in size at maturity, and such variation results in several alternative tactics to achieve fertilization
 <cit> . age at maturity is also linked to size variation; smaller, younger-maturing males may adopt sneaking to gain access to spawning females
 <cit> . on the other hand, large, late-maturating males may engage in fighting and outcompete smaller males to gain access to spawning females
 <cit> . in female salmon, variability in size and age tends to be smaller than in males, and studies suggest that large body size may increase their reproductive success
 <cit> .

within the salmonids, coho salmon  provides a simple study subject for studies on the effect of selection because it is strictly anadromous, and has shorter generation time and simpler age structure compared to most other salmonids; this species typically returns from the ocean at three years of age, while some younger-maturing males, “jacks,” return at two years
 <cit> . like most oncorhynchus, this species is semelparous
 <cit> ; thus, there are no repeat spawners that may hinder precise separation of parental and offspring generations, which could further complicate the assessment of the magnitude and mode of selection based on estimates of individual reproductive success.

the aim of this study was to investigate the temporal variation in selection by comparing the mode, direction and strength of selection on fitness related traits between two cohorts of wild coho salmon. here, we followed the convention of siepielski et al. <cit>  and defined the dynamics of temporal variation in selection as “the interannual differences in selection on a given trait within a population.” specifically, we examined selection on date of return and body length in the wild population at big beef creek, washington. information obtained was used to illustrate how selection operates in nature and to provide insights into the temporal dynamics of selection. pedigree reconstruction based on  <dig> highly polymorphic dna microsatellite loci was conducted using more than  <dig> individuals, and lifetime reproductive success of two parental brood years was quantified. younger- and older-maturing males of this species exhibit alternative tactics to maximize reproductive success . therefore, the mode, direction and strength of selection acting on males of two age classes and females of a single age class were estimated separately. estimated selection in this study are the results of both natural and sexual selection, as selection estimates were obtained from regression analyses with lifetime reproductive success as a fitness measure.

RESULTS
characteristics of sampled fish
a total of  <dig> returning adults were sampled from  <dig> to  <dig>  on december 3rd in  <dig>  an atypically large flood breached the weir, possibly allowing some late returning adults to enter the stream unsampled. a total of  <dig> individuals were sampled in  <dig> and 2007; these were considered candidate parents. in  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> individuals were sampled;  <dig> individuals were likely to be the offspring of the individuals collected in  <dig> and  <dig>  as 3-year-old individuals sampled in  <dig>  and 2-year-old individuals sampled in  <dig>  were candidate offspring of individuals returning in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. however, all individuals collected were genotyped and included in the analyses.

the number of fish returning in  <dig>  was greater than that in  <dig> . the sex ratio  was greater in  <dig>  than in  <dig> . there were consistently more males present in  <dig>  whereas the male to female sex ratio remained low for the majority of the season in  <dig> . in  <dig>  the proportion of 2- to 3-year-old males was  <dig> : <dig>  but this ratio decreased to  <dig> : <dig> in  <dig> . the date of return differed between the two years; individuals arrived from november 2nd to december 15th in  <dig>  but arrived earlier from october 1st to november 20th in  <dig>  the mean date of return by sex ranged from november 6th  to 9th  in  <dig>  and from october 23rd  to 26th  in  <dig> . individuals tended to be smaller in  <dig> .

population genetic statistics
genotyping error rate was small, with the error rate per locus ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> % . across years, no consistent presence of null alleles was detected in all loci, and no large allele dropout or accidental scoring of stuttering were detected.  <dig> % of the collected samples  were successfully genotyped at more than  <dig> loci, and  <dig> % of the collected samples  were successfully genotyped at more than  <dig> loci. all loci were moderately to highly polymorphic, with the number of alleles ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and observed heterozygosity ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . among  <dig> tests , significant deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium was observed in  <dig> tests . such results may be due to the large sample sizes in  <dig> and 2009; however, observed and expected heterozygosity was similar across all loci in all years . fis values tended to be small, ranging from − <dig>  to  <dig>  across all loci in all years .

parentage analysis
the exclusion probabilities for two-parent and single-parent assignments were >  <dig>  according to franz, indicating that the microsatellite dataset provided sufficient power to perform parentage analyses. results from the tests on the error in our parentage assignment suggest that our error in assigning parents was between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. specifically, when pedigree reconstruction was performed with individuals sampled in  <dig> as candidate parents and individuals sampled in  <dig> as candidate offspring,  <dig> % of the assignments  calculated by franz had greater than 99% posterior probability. when pedigree reconstruction was performed with individuals sampled in  <dig> as candidate parents and individuals sampled in  <dig> as candidate offspring,  <dig> % of the assignments  calculated by franz had more than 99% posterior probability. assignments with more than 99% probability obtained by franz were compared with assignments obtained by colony for the  <dig> brood year, and  <dig> % of mismatches in assignments were observed .

among  <dig> returning individuals that could be the offspring of adults returning in  <dig>   <dig> individuals  were assigned to both parents,  <dig> individuals were assigned to a father only ,  <dig> individuals were assigned to a mother only , and  <dig> individuals  were not assigned to any parents . among  <dig> returning individuals that could be the offspring of adults returning in  <dig>   <dig> individuals  were assigned to both parents,  <dig> individuals were assigned to a father only ,  <dig> individuals were assigned to a mother only , and  <dig> individuals  were not assigned to any parents . among a total of  <dig> individuals that had both parents assigned,  <dig> individuals were assigned to parents that were sampled across different years . given that such matings were impossible, further analyses were performed with and without these assignments. because the results and their significance did not differ, these assignments were excluded from further analyses.

number of offspring that were assigned to both parents, to a father only, to a mother only, or to no parents for the  <dig> and  <dig> cohort.

the majority of the population produced no or few offspring in both brood years, while some individuals produced a large number of offspring . in  <dig>   <dig> % of 2-year-old males,  <dig> % of 3-year-old males and  <dig> % of females produced no returning adult offspring. in  <dig>   <dig> % of 2-year-old males,  <dig> % of 3-year-old males and  <dig> % of females produced no returning adult offspring. average reproductive success in all three groups was higher for the  <dig> brood year than the  <dig> brood year . however, a significant difference in reproductive success between  <dig> and  <dig> was only detected in 3-year-old males and females , and no such difference was detected in 2-year-old males .

selection analysis
date of return
in the  <dig> brood year, a positive quadratic selection gradient  on return timing was observed in 2-year-old males, indicating that disruptive selection favored both early and late returning individuals ; the univariate cubic spline also supported this finding . a linear gradient in 3-year-old males was negative , indicating that earlier returning individuals had greater reproductive success . this trend is also illustrated by the univariate cubic splines . neither the linear nor quadratic gradients were significant in females , although the cubic spline showed that early returning individuals tended to produce more offspring .

coefficients of the best models of relative fitness for the  <dig> and  <dig> parental cohort. models were chosen based on the akaike information criterion  score. because of the log-link used with the zero-inflated model, these coefficients are in log space and quadratic terms are not transformed . one standard deviation is shown in parentheses.

in the  <dig> brood year, there was less evidence of selection on return timing. no statistical support for selection on date of return was observed in males of either age class . no strong relationship was detected via univariate cubic splines in 3-year-old males. however, the cubic spline implied that both early and late returning individuals tended to produce more offspring for 2-year-old males . the pattern for 2-year-old males may reflect the lack of power to detect selection in this dataset, as 2-year-old males were rare in  <dig> . in females, a significant negative quadratic gradient  was observed, indicating that females returning in the middle of the season had higher fitness than early or late returning females . however, no strong relationship was detected via univariate cubic splines in females .

body length
in the  <dig> brood year, no significant support for selection was detected for body length in males of either age class . however, the univariate cubic spline showed that large individuals tended to produce more offspring in both groups . a significant negative bivariate selection gradient on date of return and length  for 2-year-old males  indicated that higher reproductive success of younger- or late-returning males depended on their size. no significant gradient was detected for older males or for females. for females, the linear gradient on length was positive , indicating that directional selection favored larger individuals. graphical representation of the relationship between body length and reproductive success also supported the trend that larger females tended to produce more offspring .

in the  <dig> brood year, no significant selection gradient on length was detected in 2-year-old males , and no trend was observed via univariate cubic splines . in 3-year-old males, selection favored large size, as the linear gradient was positive ; the cubic splines also showed that larger individuals tended to produce more offspring in this group . the quadratic gradient in females was negative , indicating that intermediate-sized females had higher fitness than bigger-sized or smaller-sized females . the univariate cubic spline also implied that intermediate-sized individuals tended to produce more offspring .

environmental influence on return date
in  <dig>  the majority of the population returned at the beginning of the run . in contrast, fish in  <dig> returned episodically over a series of peaks throughout the run . a significant correlation was found between count of daily arrivals and the amount of daily water discharge for both males and females in  <dig> . no such correlation was detected in in  <dig> 

discussion
the aim of our study was to determine the temporal variation in the mode, magnitude and direction of selection in a natural coho salmon population using measures of individual fitness. our results have shown that reproductive success, as well as selection on body size and date of return to the spawning ground differed markedly between two parental cohorts. adults in the  <dig> brood year had higher reproductive success than those in  <dig>  and direction and strength of selection differed for both traits between two cohorts. in the first parental cohort, there was significant selection on date of return for 2- and 3-year-old males , and on body length for females . in the second parental cohort, there was significant directional selection favoring larger size in 3-year-old males and stabilizing selection on both date of return and size in females. the only evidence for bivariate selection on timing and size was in 2-year-old males in  <dig>  observed fluctuations in selection may be due to factors such as changes in precipitation, proportion of 2-year-old versus 3-year-old males, sex ratio and spawner density, as well as the occurrence of catastrophic events . although stream discharge itself did not explain variation in relative fitness in all groups, results suggest that precipitation affects return timing of big beef creek coho in some years, potentially explaining the variation in the intensity and the direction of selection on this trait.

pedigree quality and incorrect assignments can affect the estimated reproductive success and selection gradients
 <cit> . calculated exclusion probabilities showed that our microsatellite dataset was sufficient for identifying parents, and the addition of more markers is less likely to improve our estimates. low error rates in our parentage assignment affirmed that microsatellites used in our analyses provided enough statistical power to exclude non-candidate parents. nevertheless, our overall assignment rate of offspring to one parent or both parents was approximately 50% in the first cohort and 25% in the second cohort. such results may have occurred due to genotyping errors, to unsampled parents in the candidate parent generations, or to immigration from a non-natal stream during the candidate offspring generations. it is possible that a large number of parents were not sampled at the weir, especially in  <dig> when there was a late flood, and this could have led to reduction in assignment success. however, traps were maintained well past the return season and flooding occurred after this period. additionally, if the number of unsampled parents returned randomly during the season, we would expect to see a larger number of assignments to single parents than to both parents, especially given the number of individuals with unassigned parents. this outcome was not the case. assignment to single parents varied between two to six percent, and these figures are comparable between both cohorts. while we cannot rule out inefficiency in trapping, especially in  <dig>  the most plausible explanation for unassigned fish in the offspring generations is that they were immigrants. parentage estimates in similar systems
 <cit>  acknowledged that not all parents were sampled. in these studies, there was a greater proportion of single parent assignments  than we observed in this study. all information combined indicates that our sampling was not biased, and the results obtained here were sufficient to gain insights into the factors associated with reproductive success and the process of natural selection on adult size and return timing. because the estimates of selection were calculated on the parental generation using individual reproductive success, the rate of immigrants in the offspring generation has no bearing on selection estimates. however, we do acknowledge that offspring of the adults that might have emigrated to neighboring streams were not measured in our study, and we might have underestimated individual reproductive success. we assumed that offspring straying was not affected by parental phenotype.

in both  <dig> and  <dig>  the majority of the fish did not produce any returning adult offspring. however, overall reproductive success of the  <dig> parental cohort was higher than the  <dig> parental cohort across both sexes and age groups. such a drastic decrease in reproductive success may be explained by the substantial autumn flood that occurred in late  <dig>  in this year, all individuals arrived by november 20th, therefore nests of all females were susceptible to disturbance from the flood that occurred on december 3rd. this large flood likely scoured egg pockets of the nests, destroying fish eggs during incubation
 <cit> . a decrease in reproductive success may also be explained by density dependent effects; there was a greater number of spawners present in  <dig>  long-term data from big beef creek coho salmon has shown that there is an inverse relationship between the number of female spawners and the number of coho smolts produced by each female
 <cit> . this relationship is likely due to overspawning mortality because greater density of female spawners results in nest destruction and use of less suitable habitat
 <cit> .

the direction and strength of selection differed for both traits across all groups between the two parental brood years, and these results might be attributable to variation in return numbers, sex ratios and differences in environment. in  <dig>  precipitation did not occur until the beginning of november, delaying the return timing of the population . over 80% of the population returned in the first seven days of the return season, and the male–female sex ratio was particularly high at the beginning of the season . selection favoring early return in 3-year-old males suggests that earlier returning individuals may have had increased opportunities for mating under these circumstances
 <cit> . changes in male to female sex ratio during the season revealed that there were consistently more males present; an absence of selection in females thus implies that they were able to secure high-quality sites for nests and obtain mates throughout the spawning season. interestingly, males of both age classes returned from november 2nd to 22nd and from december 12th to 14th. these were the periods of high density in the stream, possibly explaining significant disruptive selection on date of return in 2-year-old males. as the ability of older, larger males to monopolize access to females tends to decrease at higher densities of spawners
 <cit> , “sneaking tactics” employed by 2-year-old males were likely more effective during these periods.

in  <dig>  the return period was protracted, and individuals returned earlier over a series of peaks from october 1st to november 20th . the male to female sex ratio remained low for the majority of the season , therefore earlier return might not have been necessary for males to maximize mating opportunities. in females, however, the low male to female sex ratio and the high number of returning females suggest that the opportunity for intrasexual competition among females would have been high. therefore, return in mid-season may have been important to both secure high-quality sites for nests and gain mates.

mating success of male salmon is often determined by female choice and intrasexual competition, and studies suggest that there is a positive relationship between male social status and body length
 <cit> . unlike in  <dig>  males were more abundant in 2007; therefore, intrasexual competition among males in  <dig> might have resulted in directional selection, favoring larger size in 3-year-old males of this cohort. although no selection on size was detected in 2-year-old males in  <dig>  this result may be due to a lack of power because these males were rarer in  <dig>  mating success of small, younger-maturing males  is frequency-dependent relative to large, older-maturing males
 <cit> , and jacks enjoy reproductive advantages when their form is rarer
 <cit> . therefore, it is possible that 2-year-old males had reproductive advantages in  <dig>  as they were uncommon . in females, selection favored large size in  <dig> but intermediate size in  <dig>  these results were unexpected, as numerous reproductive advantages are known to accompany greater size
 <cit> . however, several studies have suggested that selection may not always favor large size, because efforts of attaining large size also increase the cost associated with growth rate
 <cit> .

observed patterns of selection can be compared to other studies on natural populations of steelhead trout , coho salmon , and a colonizing population of coho salmon . all studies estimated selection on body length and return date in males and females. consistent directional selection toward later return date was observed by ford et al. <cit> . in contrast, our findings support the results of seamons et al. <cit>  and anderson et al. <cit> , who observed fluctuation in the mode, direction and strength of selection on return date in both sexes. variation in selection might have been observed because of the large number of replicates in seamons et al. <cit>  and anderson et al. <cit> . as we observed, environmental conditions  likely affect return date in salmon; thus, accurate patterns of selection on this trait may only be obtained using sufficient replicates. anderson et al. <cit>  observed consistent directional selection on body length, favoring large size in both sexes. in contrast, and similar to our study, seamons et al. <cit>  and ford et al. <cit>  observed fluctuations in the mode and direction of selection on this trait in both sexes. such results may reflect temporal variation in intraspecific competition. in particular, ford et al. <cit>  observed changing proportions of younger- and older-maturing males between two cohorts; different frequencies of these males potentially resulted in variation in intensity of intraspecific competition, leading to fluctuating selection. additionally, seamons et al. <cit>  attributed changes in sex ratio and breeding density in both sexes as a potential cause of fluctuating selection. our findings support both studies because changes in the proportion of younger- and older-maturing males, sex ratio and breeding density likely caused fluctuations in selection.

because coho salmon at big beef creek is a long established population, the distribution of studied traits was presumed to be at a stable optimum, and weak selection was expected. however, strong selection was observed in some years, and the direction and strength of selection were not consistent between two cohorts in this study. the extensive review on selection in natural populations found that the direction and strength of selection vary substantially and that quadratic selection is typically quite weak in wild
 <cit> . established wild populations may be “chasing” fluctuating optima, and that selection can be quite strong in some years, and not so in others, and that the direction of selection varies over time
 <cit> . such fluctuations in selection may act to maintain phenotypic variation in the traits in question, and we may have observed this process in our study.

CONCLUSIONS
we found evidence of selection on body length and date of return to the spawning ground, both of which are important fitness-related traits in salmonids. reproductive success and the mode, direction and strength of selection widely varied between two parental brood years; differences may be due to factors such as annual changes in precipitation, occurrence of catastrophic events , the proportion of younger- versus older-maturing males, sex ratio and densities of spawners. as these factors are seldom consistent each year, long-term studies may be important to gain insights into anticipated evolutionary change.
