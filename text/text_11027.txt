BACKGROUND
acyl-coa binding proteins  bind long chain acyl-coa esters through an acyl-coa-binding domain, with very high affinity . they are involved in the formation of long-chain fatty acyl-coa pools and act as an intracellular acyl-coa transporter . acbps are possibly the transporters of synthesized fatty acids from plastid to endoplasmic reticulum, prior to the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol , principal compound of essential oils used for food, biofuel and many industrial applications. arabidopsis thaliana acbps  are divided in four classes, with six members that differ in structure, functions, expression, subcellular location and acyl-coa ester affinities . class i are the smallest acbps, usually called acbp <dig>  and contain  <dig> amino acids. acbp <dig> are localized in the cytosol, where they have affinity to bind linoleyl-coa  <cit> , they are expressed in all plants organs  <cit> . these small acbps are involved in intracellular binding and trafficking of phosphatidylcholine in plant phospholipid metabolism  <cit> . they maintain balance between acyl-coa and phosphatidylcholine to improve acyl exchange  <cit> . class ii correspond to the ankyrin repeats proteins ; they share the  <dig>  % of identity and have respectively  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. acbp <dig> and acbp <dig> are localized in the plasma membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , both of them are membrane proteins involved in membrane-associated acyl-coa transfer and metabolism functions  <cit> , they bind linoleoyl-coa and linolenoyl-coa esters  <cit> . acbp <dig> are highly expressed in seeds and siliques  <cit>  and acbp <dig> are expressed in roots, stems and flowers  <cit> . the class iii acbps are commonly called “large acbps” or acbp <dig>  they contain  <dig> amino acids. acbp <dig> have an extracellular location, they are highly expressed in siliques and young shoots  <cit> . acbp <dig> bind arachidonyl-coa with high affinity  <cit> . the kelch motif proteins are the class iv acbps ; these two copies share the  <dig>  % of identity and have respectively  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. acbp <dig> and acbp <dig> are located in the cytosol  <cit> , where they have high affinity to bind oleoyl-coa. in presence of free oleoyl-coa that might inhibit the glucose-6-phosphate in the plastid, they can suppress synthesis dysfunction of starch and fatty acid  <cit> . they have more significant role in lipid transfer from the plastids to the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , and more roles for the biosynthesis of non-plastidial membrane lipids  <cit> . these kelch motif acbps are expressed in all tissues, with a higher expression of acbp <dig> in roots and a lower expression in siliques. acbp <dig> were found in young shoots and mature leaves but in a lower rate than acbp <dig>  <cit> .

brassica napus is an important oil crop. it is a descendant lineage from hybridization between brassica rapa and brassica oleracea. b. napus 10-kda acbps  were identified twenty years ago  <cit> . recent study revealed that they could change acyl-coa and tag composition in seeds  <cit> . the kelch motif atacbps have many important functions. besides their ability to maintain and transport oleoyl-coa from plastid to endoplasmic reticulum in plant metabolism, their structure that contains kelch domains, a protein-protein interaction site, makes them involved in plant stress responses  <cit> . due to the importance attributed to the kelch motif atacbps and those of small bnacbps, it might be possible that the kelch motif bnacbps share the same, or more, functions with them. thus, the identification and characterization of bnacbps could provide a basis for further studies about their functions. in this way, their exploitation can be useful in agriculture.

the present study aims to explore acbps in b. napus. this report contains four parts. firstly, acbps were identified and characterized in b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus; amino acid sequence identities were compared. secondly, atacbps and bnacbps domain structures were analyzed. thirdly, a phylogenetic analysis based on conserved domain was carried out. finally, the comparison in chromosome locations of the kelch motif acbps was made.

RESULTS
acbps in b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus
acbps were identified based on homology with atacbps. similar to atacbps, they could be divided in four classes, with multiple copies . small acbps had  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, ankyrin repeats acbps had  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, large acbps had  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids and kelch motif acbps had  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. small acbps in b. rapa  and in b. oleracea  had three copies each; however, small bnacbps had only four copies. they were inherited from bra <dig> , bra <dig> , bra <dig>  and bol <dig> . amino acid sequence comparison showed that small bnacbps could share an average identity of  <dig>  % with atacbps,  <dig>  % with bracbps, and  <dig>  % with b. oleracea acbps boacbps . each of ankyrin repeats bracbps and boacbps had two copies. thus, four ankyrin repeats bnacbps could share about  <dig>  % of amino acid sequence identity with atacbps,  <dig>  % with bracbps, and  <dig>  % with boacbps. in addition, two ankyrin repeats bnacbps  might belong to acbp <dig> subclass , and two other ankyrin repeats bnacbps  might be acbp <dig> . four copies of large bnacbps were inherited from four copies of large acbps of b. rapa and b. oleracea. they shared about  <dig>  % of amino acid sequence identity with atacbps,  <dig>  % with bracbps, and  <dig>  % with boacbps. eight copies of kelch motif bnacbps were cloned and sequenced. they are available on genbank . kelch motif bnacbps were cloned from material grown in a semi-winter type area in china, they were the subject to further function analysis; but also, different lines snp might exist as the material used for the sequencing of b. napus is not the same. these kelch motif bnacbps were compared with six copies of putative kelch motif bnacbps found in the database. amino acid sequence identity was compared . both ais <dig> and ais <dig> shared  <dig>  % of amino acid sequence identity with bnaa05g31780d, and  <dig>  % of identity with bra <dig>  however, ais <dig> shared  <dig>  % of identity with ais <dig>  similarly, both ais <dig> and ais <dig> shared respectively 100 % and  <dig>  % of identity with bnaanng02420d, and 100 % and  <dig>  % with bol <dig>  they, however, shared  <dig>  % of identity between them. besides, ais <dig> and ais <dig> shared  <dig>  % of identity and ais <dig> and ais <dig> shared  <dig>  % of identity. these eight cloned copies of kelch motif bnacbps could share amino acid sequence identity of about  <dig>  % with atacbps,  <dig>  % with bracbps, and  <dig>  % with boacbps. otherwise, ais <dig>  ais <dig>  ais <dig>  ais <dig>  ais <dig> and ais <dig> could be acbp <dig> , and ais <dig> and ais <dig> could be acbp <dig> . these results indicated that acbps were conserved in b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus. moreover, bnacbps shared high amino acid sequences identity with atacbps, bracbps and boacbps.table  <dig> acbp in a. thaliana, b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus. an, cn or un correspond to unspecified chromosome location

domain structure of atacbps and bnacbps
domain structure of atacbps and bnacbps were analyzed . they commonly contained the acyl-coa binding domain , but obviously differed in acbd location and in extra domain structures in two classes of acbp, the ankyrin repeats and the kelch motif acbps. acbd was the only domain apparent in small acbps and seemed to be extended in almost all the protein . ankyrin repeats acbps had n-terminal acbd , and c-terminal ankyrin domain . similar to small acbps, large acbps had only one domain corresponding to acbd  located in the c-terminal of the proteins. however, acbd were located in the n-terminal side of kelch motif acbps . additionally, four or five kelch motifs that belonged to kelch  <dig> superfamily were found. alignment of each kelch motif showed  <dig> highly conserved amino acid residues in the first kelch motif ,  <dig> residues in the second kelch motif ,  <dig> residues in the third kelch motif ,  <dig> residues in the fourth kelch motif , and  <dig> residues in the fifth kelch motif  . apparently, the second kelch motif was missing in at5g <dig>  in ais <dig> and in ais <dig> . alignment showed that at5g <dig> differed from other acbps in gln- <dig>  pro- <dig>  met- <dig>  cys- <dig> and ser- <dig>  likewise in ais <dig> and ais <dig>  phe- <dig> and ile- <dig> were uncommon. finally, the alignment of all four classes of acbps highlighted conserved amino acid residues, but only within the acbd. nevertheless, acbd had some dissimilar amino acid sequences in each class of acbp . these findings indicated acbps differed in domain structure, and bnacbps and atacbps domain structure were very similar.fig.  <dig> domain structure of atacbps and bnacbps. the architecture was generated by using batch cd-search from ncbi database. acbd are labeled in yellow, ankyrin repeats domains are in green and kelch domains are in blue



phylogenetic relationship of brassicaceae acbps
analysis was carried out to highlight the phylogenetic relationships among brassicaceae acbp families. five species belonging to brassicaceae family and two monocots species belonging to poaceae family were used for the analysis. each species could contain acbps belonging to the four classes, except for a. lyrata in which class ii was missing. sixty-four amino acid sequences were involved in the analysis. the tree was rooted with chlorella sp.  and was inferred based on domain structure using neighbor-joining  and maximum likelihood , topologies were very similar. the tree was divided into four major clusters corresponding to separate classes of acbp. the topology of the tree related to each class of acbp was almost uniform: monocots  diverged before the brassicaceae family and appeared to be distantly related with them. obviously, class i was basal, but lacked bootstrap support . class i acbps with  <dig> amino acids  diverged separately from those with  <dig> amino acids. class iv appeared as a well supported clade , it originated after the divergence of class i. acbp <dig> diverged before acbp4; similarly in class ii, acbp <dig> diverged before acbp <dig>  class ii was moderately supported . class iii, however, was weakly supported . as in class i, class iii shorter proteins  diverged separately from the longer ones. these results illustrated the evolutionary relationship of acbps, and their divergence leading to four distinct classes.fig.  <dig> evolutionary relationships of land plant acbps. the evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method based on equal input model. the analysis involved  <dig> amino acid sequences. evolutionary analyses were conducted in mega6



chromosome location of kelch motif bnacbps
in our previous analysis, eight copies of kelch motif bnacbps were cloned and they corresponded to six copies of kelch motif bnacbps found on the database. these six copies of kelch motif bnacbps were located on six different chromosomes and they were associated to ancestors bracbps, boacbps and atacbps. four maps were constructed. bnaa03g29000d  was located on a <dig>  similar to parent bra <dig> . bnac03g34240d  was located on c3; parent bol <dig> was placed on sca <dig> . to investigate where each chromosome was located on the scaffold, we used the blastp search of ensemblplants by ebi   <cit> , with bol <dig> as query. thus, bol <dig> is on sca <dig> of c <dig>  as well, bnaanng02420d  had homolog bol <dig> placed on sca <dig> of c <dig> . bnanng02420d should have been found on c <dig>  but obviously was located on an unspecified chromosome a. bnaa05g31780d  and parent bra <dig> were both placed on a <dig> . bnac02g39790d  and homolog bol <dig> were both located on c <dig>  whereas bnaa02g31230d  and bra <dig> were both placed on a <dig> . chromosome location of bnacbp-ais <dig> could not be predicted, considering amino acid identity it could share with available genes on the database, it might be on a missing genomic contig. in this study, genes could be related in ascendant or descendant order but synteny was still preserved. otherwise, one gene in a. thaliana might have two copies homolog on the same chromosome in brassica, also one gene copy in b. rapa or b. oleracea might have two copies homolog in b. napus. for example, at3g <dig> had two copies homolog to bra <dig> and bra <dig> on a <dig> . however, one copy of bracbp or boacbp had only one copy of bnacbp homolog on the related chromosome location. as predicted acbp <dig>  bnaa03g29000d , bnac03g34240d , bnaa05g31780d  and bnaanng02420d  were associated to homolog at3g <dig>  located on chromosome  <dig>  as well, predicted acbp <dig> bnac02g39790d  and bnaa02g31230d  were associated to at5g <dig> . these findings suggested b. napus inherited acbp from b. rapa and b. oleracea, conserving their chromosome location.fig.  <dig> comparison maps of kelch motif atacbp, bracbp, boacbp and bnacbp. maps were built manually, associating the homologue genes from each species. acbps are in bold. b. napus chromosomes are in yellow: this figure represents ais <dig> and ais76199



discussion
acbps were conserved in brassicaceae
bracbps, boacbps and bnacbps were identified based on homology to atacbps. their sizes were ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, which were relatively close to those of atacbps with  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . besides, eight copies of kelch motif acbp were cloned from b. napus of a semi winter-type growing area in china. however, only six copies were found on the database given that two cloned copies  shared the same amino acid sequence identity of  <dig>  % with one copy of the database , and one cloned copy  could only share its highest identity  with bnaanng02420d, which already shared 100 % of identity with ais <dig>  this might be explained by the difference in plant materials. the brassica napus french homozygous winter line ‘darmor-bzh’ was used as reference for the genome sequencing  <cit> . the number of acbp copies in b. napus obviously increased because b. napus inherited acbp copies from its parents b. rapa and b. oleracea. therefore, bnacbps could be divided into four classes. bnacbps shared an amino acid identity of  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % with atacbps, with the lowest rating in large acbps and the highest in the kelch motif acbps. four small bnacbps were acquired from the genoscope database. earlier, six genes of about  <dig> amino acids in bnacbps were identified, in which three genes were inherited from b. rapa and three genes were from b. oleracea  <cit> . the missing two copies corresponded to those inherited from b. oleracea  given that they were not clearly specified from the database. thus, small bnacbps shared the  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % of amino acid sequence identity with atacbps, closely similar to previous finding in which the amino acid identity between small bnacbp and atacbp was 84 %  <cit> . bnacbps shared high amino acid identity with atacbps, except for large acbps in which similarity was rather low compared to those of the other classes. nevertheless, comparing large bnacbps with homologues bracbps and boacbps exposed high amino acid sequence identity  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. substantial mutations might have occurred during evolution resulting in a significant difference in amino acid sequence identity between these large atacbps and bnacbps. two classes of atacbps had two members: ankyrin repeats acbps and kelch motif acbps. ankyrin repeats acbps could be subdivided in acbp <dig> and acbp <dig>  they shared the  <dig>  % of identity  <cit> . similarly, kelch motif atacbps included acbp <dig> and acbp <dig>  which shared the  <dig>  % of identity  <cit> . comparison in amino acid sequence identity allowed to define these subdivisions within the ankyrin repeats bnacbps and the kelch motif bnacbps. these findings affirm the conservation of acbps in brassicaceae, with high amino acid sequence identity.

bnacbps differed in domain structure, similar to atacbps
conserved domain in atacbps and bnacbps were analyzed through batch cd-search of ncbi. acbps common domain structure was the acyl-coa binding domain , which allowed them to fulfill their roles in binding acyl-coa esters with very high affinity . bnacbps structure conserved this acbd but locations were different, as in atacbps. moreover, in a. thaliana each class of acbp had dissimilar affinity in binding acyl-coa as introduced previously. this dissimilarity might probably due to difference in amino acid sequence . ankyrin repeats and kelch motif acbps differed from small and large acbps by the presence of protein-protein interaction site as additional domains  <cit> . one ankyrin domain was found in each protein. this domain of about  <dig> amino acid residues was involved in cell signals or regulation  <cit> . four or five kelch motifs were found in our analysis; previous findings reported five kelch domains in atacbps  <cit> . kelch motif is a sequence of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in the protein; it is one of ancient and ordinary domains, and usually a group of four to seven motifs forms the kelch repeat domain  <cit> . in our analysis, loss of one kelch motif  was observed in at5g <dig>  ais <dig> and ais <dig>  this loss might be explained with amino acid substitutions in this region of protein . function or expression of protein might be different within acbps, in consequence of this loss. for instance, atacbp <dig>  which contained five kelch motifs were highly expressed in root whereas atacbp <dig>  which was demonstrated in our study to have only four kelch motifs, was expressed in shoots and mature, leaves  <cit> . these five kelch domains belonged to the kelch  <dig> superfamily, but conserved amino acid residues were not identical, confirming the existence of multiple families of kelch domain  <cit> . ankyrin repeats and kelch motif domains could imply these acbps in many biological functions such as plant defense and stress responses  <cit> : ankyrin repeats atacbps were involved in response to heavy metal accumulation  <cit>  but also in tolerance of dry conditions  <cit> . kelch motif atacbp <dig> could act in response to accumulation of pb  in root  <cit> . these findings confirm bnacbps differ not only in size but also in domain structure.

acbps evolved into four separate classes of diverse structure
acbps from a selected group of brassicaceae and monocots were assembled for the phylogenetic analysis. to emphasize relationship among them, both nj and ml tree were reconstructed, based on the conserved domain. sixty-four acbps were involved, including acbp of algae to root the tree. the presence of acbps in these species indicated their importance in biological function, and their existence before the divergence of land plants  <cit> . one class might have more than one copy due to duplication event resulting in dissimilar sequences  <cit> . in monocots, class i contained two or three copies and the other classes contained only one copy, this shows that gene duplication occurred only in class i for this group  <cit> . a. lyrata class ii was missing. a.lyrata and a. thaliana are close enough that many traits are shared between them. their divergence occurred about ten million years ago. a. lyrata genome is twice larger than that of a. thaliana. the missing class ii acbps in a. lyrata might have resulted from the insertions and deletion events that occurred in this evolution  <cit> , leading to the loss of ankyrin repeats in a. lyrata acbp. monocots were distantly related to the brassicaceae family, their divergence occurred earlier, during the evolution of land plants. in all acbp classes, brassica genera and arabidopsis genera phylogenetic positions were close affirming that brassica acbps shared common ancestry with arabidopsis  <cit> . the tree illustrated four major clusters corresponding to separate acbp classes. class i might be basal, since phylogenetic analysis with rice acbps suggested class i might be ancestral  <cit> , which is also accurate in our study. however, class i had inappropriate bootstrap support, which makes this hypothesis uncertain. class i are single-domain proteins of about  <dig> amino acids, they were first cloned from b. napus  <cit> . class i was demonstrated to be highly conserved in all species, not only in plants  <cit> . class ii and class iv deviated separately after class i divergence. in our analysis, acbp <dig> and acbp <dig> were distantly related, suggesting their early divergence, similarly to acbp <dig> and acbp <dig> of class iv. both class ii and class iv are multi-domain proteins, which might be born from a pre-existing protein domain combination, since domains tend to combine within each other to generate new multi-domain proteins . class iii originated after class ii divergence; they had an n-terminal transmembrane domain as class ii. due to their phylogenetic position, class ii and class iii acbps were suggested to be functionally related  <cit> . acbp is highly conserved in plants and paralogues born from a common ancestor  <cit> . acbps become larger with evolution  <cit> . this might explain the difference in size of acbps, smaller in the proposed ancestral class i and larger in the other classes. in fact, protein domains as conserved in acbps are basic building blocks that define structure and function of proteins  <cit> ; they have an independent evolution . they originated from conglomerates of short polypeptide segments that fold together  <cit> . duplication, divergence and recombination of domains generate proteins. new genes are mainly harbored from duplication and this could happen also for domains  <cit> . thus, evolution of acbp by domain duplication and recombination might be possible. duplication induced mutations explaining divergence; and recombination harbored new folds of new proteins with new functions that evolved from common ancestors  <cit> . consequently, protein domains change within sequence, structure and function but also in occurrence in the genomes of different organisms  <cit> . because duplication, convergence or divergence of protein domains , or formation of multi-domain proteins  through domain combination  <cit>  are usual in protein evolution, this might have happened in evolutionary history of acbp. otherwise, acbps were demonstrated to show high evolutionary conservation in structure and function, precisely in basal cellular functions  <cit> . acbps were detected in different species: 30 % of residues among them are conserved in the acyl-coa binding domain   <cit> . alignment of the four classes of acbps in our study confirmed acbd as the only common domain; remaining amino acid residues had no similarities. nevertheless, acbds showed some dissimilarity, which could explain diverse acyl-coa-binding preferences of different classes of acbp  <cit> . these findings confirm the high conservation of acbps in land plants and their diversity as consequences of evolution.

b. napus inherited the kelch motif acbps from b. rapa and b. oleracea
previously, our results demonstrated the conservation of acbp in brassicaceae. the kelch motif bnacbps were demonstrated to conserve the same chromosome location as parents bracbps and boacbps, which homologues in a. thaliana were located on chromosomes  <dig> or  <dig>  in a. thaliana, chromosomes are subdivided into  <dig> blocks  <cit> . atacbps are located on block f of chromosome  <dig> and on block q of chromosome  <dig>  these blocks f and q have corresponding blocks identified in b. napus  <cit>  affirming their conservation in brassica genera. otherwise, gene loss and gene deletion possibly occurred within b. napus genome  <cit> . in our study, genes might appear to not have homolog in progenitors. this is the case of bnaa03g28980d and bnac03g34150d which homolog was absent in a <dig> of b. rapa and c <dig> of b. oleracea, respectively . gene deletion might have occurred. inversely, b. rapa and b. oleracea might not have homologues in b. napus. this is the case of bra <dig> and bol <dig> , where gene loss might have occurred. besides, genes could be present in a. thaliana but lacking in brassica genera or inversely absent in a. thaliana but present in brassica genera , as it was demonstrated that brassica genome showed mixed losses and insertions compared with a. thaliana  <cit> . lastly, bnaanng02420d , which is the homologue of bol <dig>  was not found on chromosome c in b. napus, but on an unspecified chromosome a . bnaanng02420d might be a converted gene, as many converted genes were found in b. napus genome  <cit> . however, the analyzing of neighbor genes showed that bol <dig> had homolog bnacnng24690d on an unspecified chromosome c, bol <dig> had homolog bnac03g46060d on c <dig> and bol <dig> had homolog bnac05g33680d on c <dig>  suggesting a misassembly of this region. these results confirm that synteny is preserved and kelch motif acbps are faithfully transferred to b. napus.

overview on the evolutionary history of brassica genomes, based on acbps
the allotetraploid b. napus  was synthesized from hybridization between diploid parents b. rapa  and b. oleracea . the current study focused on acbps in b. napus, but their identification was made with homology based on a. thaliana, b. rapa and b. oleracea acbps, which could highlight the evolutionary history of brassica genomes. acbps were conserved in brassicaceae. the descendant line b. napus inherited  <dig> copies each of class i, class ii and class iii acbps, and  <dig> copies of kelch motif acbps . in total,  <dig> copies of acbps were inherited from parents b. rapa and b. oleracea and presented high amino acid sequence identity, similar structure and chromosome location with them. as  <dig> copies of acbps were found in each of b. rapa and b. oleracea , four copies were lost in b. napus. they corresponded to two class i boacbps , one class iv boacbp  and one class iv bracbp  . besides, kelch motif acbps were faithfully transferred to b. napus, with six different chromosomal locations similar to parents b. rapa and b. oleracea. genomic block f and q, which contain kelch motif atacbps were also in b. napus. the chromosome evolution of brassica plants was studied through these genomic blocks, as reviewed by cheng et al.  <cit> . they emphasized that whole genome triplication  promoted the diversification of brassica plants. genome comparison between a. thaliana and b. rapa or b. oleracea exposed this wgt event experienced by these two brassica plants  <cit> . in fact, brassicaceae genomes are composed of  <dig> genomic blocks, the basic units of ancestral chromosome that reshuffled to generate the present day species. then, three sets of  <dig> genomic blocks should exist in b. rapa and b. oleracea, which means  <dig> blocks f and  <dig> blocks q each. this explains the increasing copies of kelch motifs acbps in b. rapa and b. oleracea .  <dig> blocks f and  <dig> block q, in each of b. rapa and b. oleracea, contain these kelch motif acbp. however,  <dig> copies were inherited by b. napus,  <dig> copies were lost. these  <dig> conserved copies were on  <dig> blocks f  and  <dig> blocks q . b. napus conserved these  <dig> genomic blocks from b. rapa and b. oleracea. these finding illustrate the evolutionary history of brassica genomes, using acbps as reference.

CONCLUSIONS
brassica napus acbps were identified and compared to acbps of relatives a. thaliana, b. rapa and b. oleracea. their close similarity is not surprising, no major abnormality was found. acbps had multiple copies. as domain proteins, they originated from the same ancestor that experienced domain duplication and rearrangement to generate new proteins with different stucture. this study is a prelude for acbp investigation in b. napus. multiple copies were found, multiple interesting functions are expected for crop improvement purpose.
