BACKGROUND
saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first eukaryote whose genome was fully sequenced and annotated  <cit> . it has since then been the focus of many genome-scale reconstruction efforts. forster et al  <cit>  reconstructed the first multi-compartment genome-scale metabolic model for yeast . the model accounted for  <dig> open reading frames   and  <dig>  metabolic reactions. the metabolic reactions for this model were compartmentalized between cytosol and mitochondria. transport mechanisms between these two compartments as well as between the environment and cytosol were included in the model. soon thereafter, the ind <dig> model was introduced, which included five additional compartments  by re-assessing the localization of gene products  <cit> . in a parallel study  <cit> , the predictive capability of iff <dig> was improved through a number of modifications in the biomass equation and the removal of blocked reactions . subsequently, another version of the yeast metabolic model with an improved description of the lipid metabolism containing  <dig> genes and  <dig>  reactions  was introduced by nookaew et al  <cit> . these improvements to the yeast model culminated with the imm <dig> model  <cit>  that increased the size of ind <dig> to  <dig> genes and  <dig>  reactions. all these metabolic reconstruction efforts were carried out largely independently of one another using different data sources or in some cases different interpretations of the same literature evidence. this lack of consistency motivated the yeast systems biology community to consolidate all available metabolic models into a single consensus reconstruction and annotation model  <cit> . this model has been updated regularly since it was published and the latest version  contains, in decompartmentalized form,  <dig> reactions and  <dig> proteins  <cit> .

despite all these efforts there still exists a gap in the quality between the available metabolic reconstructions for yeast and corresponding models for microbial metabolism. table  <dig> summarizes the quality metrics for the e. coli  <cit> , m. genitalium  <cit> , b. subtilis  <cit> , p. putida  <cit> , h. pylori  <cit>  and salmonella typhimurium  <cit>  latest genome-scale models when growth predictions are contrasted against experimental data for single gene deletions. as shown in this table, the accuracy  of the imm <dig> metabolic model of the yeast is significantly worse than any one of corresponding microbial models. this is partly caused by uncertainty in enzyme localization and inter-compartment metabolite transport in yeast  <cit> . this implies that a draft model reconstruction followed by even a detailed manual curation may not be a sufficient strategy to bring a eukaryotic genome-scale model to the same quality level as a microbial one. here we explore the extent of model correction that can be brought about by systematically comparing the model predictions for single and multiple gene deletions with available experimental data.

comparison of the fraction of correctly predicted lethal knockouts  of microbial genome-scale metabolic models against the yeast imm <dig> model for single gene mutation experiments.

the established standard  <cit>  for testing the accuracy of genome-scale metabolic models is to contrast the predicted growth phenotype of single mutant strains with the available experimental data under various growth conditions  <cit> . these comparisons result in four different outcomes  <cit> : gg or ngng when both model and experimental data either imply growth  or no growth  for the mutant strain, ngg when the model predicts that the gene deletion is lethal but the experiment shows that it is viable, and finally gng when the model predicts that the mutant strain would be viable but in vivo observations show a lethal effect. reed et al  <cit>  proposed a systems analysis approach to restore growth for nggs for a variety of growth media through the addition of appropriate metabolic and transport functions to the model. in another study, satish kumar et al  <cit>  introduced gapfind and gapfill, to first identify metabolites that cannot be produced or consumed in the model under any uptake conditions and then bridge these gaps by adding missing functionalities to the model. subsequently, another procedure termed growmatch  <cit>  was proposed to reconcile both ngg and gng growth prediction inconsistencies across different substrates . notably, in the growmatch procedure  <cit> , the gng mismatches are corrected by modifying the metabolic model so as to convert them to ngngs. alternatively, motter et al  <cit>  suggested to reconcile gngs by identifying candidate gene knockouts that can restore the growth of the mutants that were initially non-viable in vivo.

recent studies have suggested that making use of not only single gene deletion information but also synthetic lethal pairs or  can provide an additional layer for curation and validation of metabolic models. harrison et al  <cit>  showed that the investigation of falsely predicted synthetic lethals of s. cerevisiae can help to improve functional annotation. furthermore, recent research by our group  <cit>  demonstrated that mismatches between both growth and auxotrophy phenotypes of synthetic lethal predictions and in vivo observations can be used to provide  <dig> model correction hypotheses for the iaf <dig> model of e. coli. in this paper, we modify and deploy automated approaches  <cit>  for resolving falsely predicted single and multiple gene deletions under aerobic minimal and a complex  medium, through the generation of appropriate model-correction hypotheses for the imm <dig> model of the yeast. we chose imm <dig> for this study because it contains biomass composition and reaction reversibility information making it suitable for performing fba computations. following the workflow presented in this paper we pinpointed  <dig> model corrections and identified  <dig> missing regulatory constraints with supporting literature evidence that almost doubled the prediction accuracy of the growth phenotype of single and double gene deletions under aerobic minimal and yp media for the imm <dig> model. examples of literature evidence include interaction of two proteins to support a modification in gpr associations, presence of a specific compound in the cell wall to corroborate its inclusion in the biomass equation, or gene expression data to confirm suppression of a gene under a given condition. the majority of modifications proposed here  remain relevant even for the latest update of the community yeast model   <cit> .

RESULTS
single gene perturbations
analysis of the impact of single gene or reaction deletions on the growth phenotype  revealed  <dig> essential genes and  <dig> essential reactions for growth using a minimal medium as well as  <dig> essential genes and  <dig> essential reactions for the yp medium. we contrasted the predicted essential genes in both media to the experimental single gene deletion data reported by kuepfer et al  <cit>  to pinpoint any model inconsistencies. a summary of the model/experiment matches is given in figure 1a and 1b . we note that the two metrics specificity and sensitivity in this figure represent the fraction of correctly predicted lethal and viable mutants, respectively. comparing the accuracy of the imm <dig> model with iff <dig>   <cit>  for growth using yp medium, we find that there is a significant reduction in specificity. this reduction is primarily due to uncertainties associated with the assignment of functionalities to compartments as well as the expansion of the model with less studied reactions, as pointed out earlier  <cit> . we applied the computational procedures described in the methods section to reconcile these false predictions with the experimental growth. we note that all reaction and metabolite abbreviations throughout this manuscript are based on the imm <dig> model.

resolution of ngg inconsistencies
as denoted in figure 1a and 1b, we identified  <dig> nggs for the minimal and  <dig> for the yp medium. a summary of the pathways in which the nggs for both growth media are involved is given in additional file  <dig>  the first step towards resolution of nggs in the growmatch procedure is to look for alternate genes in yeast capable of carrying the same function but absent from the model or specific gene-protein-reaction  associations  <cit> . a bidirectional protein-protein blast  search against the s. cerevisiae genome revealed that seven of the genes involved in nggs under the minimal medium and three under the yp medium share significant sequence similarity over the entire length of protein  with other orfs in yeast. we however, rejected three such resolution strategies in the minimal medium and one in the yp medium due to contradicting experimental evidence . alternative correction strategies for the resolved nggs were also explored. two ngg inconsistencies under the minimal medium and one under the yp medium were resolved by relaxing the irreversibility of at least two reactions. for example, the deletion of gene adk <dig> , which is involved in nucleoside salvage pathway, becomes non-lethal by treating any of the reactions adpt , hxprt ), upprt  or guaprt  as reversible. the reversibility of these reactions was further supported based on the value of free gibbs energy change, Î”g, or previous reports in literature  <cit>  . notably, relaxing the irreversibility constraint on any of these reactions enables the production of prpp , which serves as a precursor for many biomass components.

upon incorporation of these two global modifications in the model, we pursued the resolution of additional nggs by adding transport reactions or reactions from the kegg database  <cit>  . we were able to reconcile the growth inconsistencies for two nggs in the minimal medium by this method. for example, ade <dig> , which codes for reaction garfti  was fixed by adding reaction r <dig>  to the model. garfti that serves as a step in the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathways is the only reaction in the model responsible for producing the essential metabolite fgam glycinamide). addition of reaction r <dig> to the model provides an alternative way of producing fgam that can compensate for the absence of garfti. by performing the blast bi-directional test we identified an orf in the yeast genome  with very high sequence similarity  with the enzyme phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase  <dig>  catalyzing r <dig> in methanococcus jannaschii, which supports the presence of this reaction in yeast.

except for two cases , all other nggs identified for the yp medium are also present and therefore corrected when considering the minimal medium. both rib <dig>  and rib <dig>  are fixed not by modifying the imm <dig> model but by adding missing compounds to the in silico yp medium description. both of these genes are involved in riboflavin  biosynthesis, which is a biomass precursor. because yeast extract is reported to be a major source of vitamin b <dig>  <cit> , we decided to add riboflavin to the list of components in the in silico yp medium. this renders the deletion of rib <dig> and rib <dig> non-lethal. notably, the importance of correctly describing the medium composition in growth phenotype predictions has been raised in previous studies  <cit> . overall, by using the growmatch procedure along with literature searches we were able to fix thirteen nggs under the minimal medium and eleven under the yp medium . the details of this analysis together with the evidence found in support of each modification are provided as additional file  <dig> 

resolution of gng inconsistencies
as shown in figure 1a and 1b, a total of  <dig> gng inconsistencies in both minimal and yp media was identified with  <dig> of them jointly present. the distribution of these genes across different functional classes of metabolism revealed that most of them are involved in trna charging, oxidative phosphorylation and extracellular transport . resolution of these gngs by growmatch generally involves suppression of incorrectly present alternative production routes of biomass components in the model. the identified gngs are divided into three major categories based on how they affect the flux distribution in the network  <cit> . the first category is comprised of genes coding for isozymes alluding that the deletion of these genes should not affect the reaction flux. a straightforward resolution strategy in this case is to suppress the other gene whose product serves as isozyme for the coded reaction. an alternative hypothesis is to modify the corresponding gpr relationship so as to recast the deletion of that gene as lethal. these resolution strategies would be viable only if the coded reaction are essential or form synthetic lethal according to the model. for example, gene aco <dig> , identified as a gng under minimal medium, is an isozyme  for mitochondrial aconitase  and also independently catalyzes cytosolic aconitaase  according to the imm <dig> model. notably, reactions, acont and acontm form a synthetic lethal pair under the minimal medium according to the imm <dig> model. we did not find any evidence indicating that aco <dig> is suppressed under aerobic glucose condition. instead, we found that the protein coded for by aco <dig>  is a putative mitochondrial aconitase isozyme, whose function has been assigned only based on the sequence similarity with aco1p  <cit> . therefore, we decided to remove aco <dig> from the gpr for acontm thus rendering the deletion of aco <dig> as lethal. this modification is consistent with the latest update of the community model  <cit> . notably, another possibility is that aco <dig> is correctly assigned to acontm, but aco <dig> is involved in other unaccounted in the model essential functions  in addition to its aconitase activity. we manage to fix five gngs under the minimal medium and three under the yp medium by using this procedure.

the second category of gngs contains genes that code for blocked reactions, i.e., the reactions that cannot carry any flux. this implies that even though the deletion of these genes will not affect the flux distribution in silico, their knockout is lethal in vivo. resolution of these inconsistencies involves first unblocking the coded reactions and next rendering its deletion lethal under the examined conditions. notably,  <dig> of such these gngs code for reactions that are always blocked in the model mainly due to the presence of a no-consumption metabolite. one can thus resolve the inconsistency by exploring whether the no-consumption metabolite is a component of the biomass equation. interestingly, we found that  <dig> of such these gngs code for trna charging reactions that can be converted to ngng consistencies by including the charged and uncharged trna molecules in place of the corresponding amino acids in the biomass equation. this strategy has been previously used in the reconstruction of the salmonella metabolic model  <cit> . for example, the gng prediction for wrs <dig> , which codes for the blocked reaction trptrs , was corrected by including charged trna  and uncharged trna  as a reactant and product of the biomass reaction, respectively. this modification simultaneously unblocks reaction trptrs and renders it essential.

in many cases, including the no-consumption metabolite of a blocked reaction encoded by a gng into the biomass equation was not a viable option as it also converted some gg consistencies to ngg mismatches . using the gapfind procedure  <cit>  we found that such problem metabolites are all upstream no-consumption, implying that they can be fixed if their corresponding root  no-consumption metabolite is resolved. therefore, we tested whether these gngs can be fixed globally, if the root or one of the downstream no-consumption metabolites is included as a component of the biomass equation. an additional seven gngs corresponding to blocked reactions were fixed by this method but were not added to the list of proposed model modifications due a lack of experimental validation . we note that the incomplete description of the biomass equation has been implicated as an important source of false model predictions in earlier studies  <cit> . therefore, we exercised great caution when modifying the biomass equation to fix an inconsistency. corrections were accepted only if solid corroborating literature evidence was found.

two other gngs were identified to correspond to a reaction that is blocked only under minimal conditions: genes mph <dig>  and mph <dig>  encode isozymes catalyzing the transport of maltose from the extra-cellular environment to cytosol . this reaction is blocked since no maltose is present in the minimal medium. therefore, we explored whether these two genes are also involved in the transport of d-glucose . a blast bi-directional analysis revealed that both of these genes have very high sequence similarity with glucose transport genes. interestingly, we found that previous studies have reported on the involvement of mph <dig> and mph <dig> in mediating residual glucose uptake  <cit> .

the third category of gngs contains genes whose deletion affects the flux distribution in the network. to rectify these mismatches we employed the original growmatch procedure introduced in  <cit>  and its modified version proposed in this study  to identify the minimal number of genes/reactions whose suppression lower the biomass formation below the pre-specified viability threshold. we performed this analysis by allowing for up to two simultaneous gene/reaction suppressions for each gng leading to the correction of  <dig> inconsistencies under the minimal and  <dig> under the yp medium. twelve of these fixed gngs in the minimal medium and fourteen in the yp were excluded from the list of corrected mismatches as we did not find any supporting evidence in the literature. overall, we fixed  <dig> gngs in the minimal and  <dig> in the yp medium by global modifications that do not conflict with any correctly predicted growth phenotype for single gene mutants. we note that  <dig> gngs that appeared in both media were corrected by the same mechanisms .

upon incorporating into the model only the corrections for nggs and gngs for which we found literature evidence, the accuracy of the imm <dig> model was substantially improved. the number of correctly predicted lethal knockouts  out of a total of  <dig> was increased from  <dig> to  <dig> for the minimal medium and from  <dig> to  <dig>  for the yp medium. the corresponding false viability rate  was decreased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the minimal medium and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the yp medium. these results are summarized in figure 1c and 1d.

double gene perturbations
we employed the sl-finder procedure  <cit>  to identify the set of all synthetic lethal  gene pairs under both minimal and yp media based on imm <dig> model of the yeast. this analysis led to identification of  <dig> sl pairs in the minimal medium and  <dig> in the yp medium. model sl prediction inconsistencies were identified by contrasting against the available experimentally identified sls . as shown in figure  <dig>  this comparison reveals a number of additional ways that model and experiment may differ in their predictions. notably, the "no growth" phenotype in this case could be due to either essentiality  or synthetic lethality  of the gene deletions. for example, ges and gsl inconsistencies refer to cases where the in silico deletion of a gene pair is not lethal  but in vivo they are lethal due to gene essentiality or synthetic lethality . similarly, esg and essl represent mismatches where the single deletion of one of the genes in silico is lethal , however, their simultaneous deletion in vivo results in either a viable strain  or a lethal phenotype , respectively. finally, slg and sles denote inconsistencies where the model implies that only the double gene mutation is lethal  but experimental observations support either growth  or lethality of any of the two single gene deletions , respectively.

in the following we describe how the restoration of each type of these inconsistencies can be used to improve the predictive capability of the imm <dig> model. in analogy to the definition of specificity for single gene mutations, we define the specificity for double gene perturbations as the fraction of correctly predicted synthetic lethals , i.e., specificity = #slsl/. we do not comment on the resolution of ges and esg mismatches, as they are completely equivalent to gng and ngg inconsistencies. in addition, we note that all the model corrections are based on the currently available incomplete list of experimentally identified sls.

resolution of gsl inconsistencies
the gsl inconsistencies denote cases where the model implies growth under the simultaneous deletion of two genes while experimental results show a lethal effect. a total of  <dig> gsls in the minimal medium and  <dig> in the yp medium were identified. we note that gsls for double perturbations can be treated similarly to the gng mismatches for single perturbations with the only difference that "no growth" in gngs is due to the essentiality of single genes whereas in gsls it is the result of synthetic lethality.

the strategy for fixing gsls involved in coding for isozymes is to repress the other genes coding for that isozyme under the examined condition or modify the gpr associations. when both genes code for isozymes for the same reaction this resolution strategy is viable only if that reaction is essential in silico. alternatively, when two genes are associated with two  different reactions they must form a synthetic lethal. we note that the gene repressions for this group of gsls can be inferred either manually by inspection of the gpr associations for each inconsistency , or automatically, by using the modified version of the growmatch . as an example, the modified growmatch procedure suggests that the gsl  can be fixed by suppressing gene yml096w. by reviewing the gpr relationships we found that genes asn <dig>  and asn <dig>  together with yml096w provide isozymes for catalyzing the essential reaction asns <dig> ). therefore, suppressing gene yml096w will render the simultaneous deletion of asn <dig> and asn <dig> lethal. note, however, that we did not find any evidence in support of yml096w suppression under aerobic minimal conditions, but we found that this gene is coding for a putative protein of unknown function and has been assigned to asn <dig> only based on the sequence similarity  <cit>  prompting us to remove yml096w from the gpr association to asn <dig>  this example demonstrates that the identified gene suppressions by growmatch may allude to incorrect assignment of genes to reactions.

resolution of gsl inconsistencies coding for the blocked reactions is more complicated than for gngs. different cases need to be examined:  if both genes appear in the gpr relationship for the same blocked reaction then we revert to the method discussed for fixing gngs.  if the two genes are coding for two  different reactions that are all blocked because of the same root no-consumption metabolite then exploring the addition of the  downstream, or the corresponding root problem metabolite, to the biomass equation as a reactant may fix the inconsistency.  if the two genes are coding for reactions that are blocked because of different root no-consumption metabolites or one of the genes codes for a non-blocked reaction then we cannot reconcile the growth inconsistency by simply modifying the biomass reaction. to resolve such gsls, the gapfill procedure is applied first to correct the root no-consumption metabolites by adding a consumption or export pathway to the model, thereby unblocking the coded reactions. with this modification, these gsls can now be treated as those where deletion of each single gene will change the flux distribution in silico. we could only fix one gsl inconsistency by modifying the biomass equation: kre <dig>  and skn <dig>  that provide isozymes for the blocked reaction 16gs  were fixed by including 16bdglcn  a root no-consumption metabolite in the biomass equation as a reactant. this modification is corroborated by the previous reports showing that  <dig>  Î²-d-glucan is a key component of the yeast cell wall  <cit> .

reconciling gsls where disruption of each single gene affects the in silico flux distribution, involves identifying missing regulatory constraints on genes/reactions by using the growmatch procedure and its modified version. we followed this analysis by allowing for up to two simultaneous gene/reaction suppressions for each gsl and considered only the global modifications. for example, genes zwf <dig>  and rpe <dig>  are both involved in the pentose-phosphate pathway and form a gsl . the deletion of either zwf <dig> or rpe <dig> will change the flux distribution in silico. application of the growmatch to fix this inconsistency suggests suppressing reaction g6pdh2er  which is identical to the reaction catalyzed by zwf1p in the cytosol . this suggests that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the endoplasmic reticulum is not sufficient to compensate for its deficiency in cytosol in an rpe <dig> mutant background. interestingly, it has been shown  <cit>  that mammalian cells have two sets of enzymes catalyzing the reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway  with the more active set in the cytoplasm and the less active in the endoplasmic reticulum. if this holds true for yeast then this could resolve the inconsistency. an alternative hypothesis for fixing the inconsistency is that zwf <dig> independently codes for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the endoplasmic reticulum  as well as in the cytosol . in another example, fur <dig>  and ura <dig>  form a gsl. they catalyze two reactions that serve as alternative production routes for ump  a biomass precursor. application of the growmatch procedure to fix this gsl suggests repressing reaction pynp2r ). according to the imm <dig> model, reaction pynp2r provides a source of uri , which subsequently is converted into ump. suppression of pynp2r will thus render the simultaneous deletion of fur <dig> and ura <dig> lethal by blocking all production routes for the biomass precursor ump . note that since pynp2r does not have any gene association in the model, its suppression to fix the gsl inconsistency also raises the possibility that this reaction is erroneously included in the model and should thus be removed.

not surprisingly all the identified suppressions for correcting gsls for the minimal medium were also valid for the yp medium. we identified only one case of a gene suppression to resolve a gsl, which was valid for only the yp medium. genes met <dig>  and met <dig> , identified as a gsl in both minimal and yp media provide isozymes for reaction mthfr <dig> ), which is involved in folate metabolism. application of the modified growmatch to resolve this inconsistency suggests suppression of cys <dig>  in both minimal and yp media. however, suppressing cys <dig> under the minimal medium will change some ggs to nggs  whereas, it is a global suppression in the yp medium. interestingly, in support of cys <dig> suppression in the yp medium, it was reported before that this gene is cystein, methionine and glutathione suppressed  <cit> .

finally, in some cases gsl mismatches allude to incorrect gpr relationships in the model. for example, we found four gsls  involved in a gpr that implicates genes prs <dig> through  <dig>  the first two include two genes  and ) and the other two contain three genes  and ). all these genes provide isozymes for the essential reaction prpps  according to the imm <dig> model. the inconsistency between model predictions and experimental observations can be resolved by changing the gpr relationship from  to  or  to render the simultaneous deletion of each of the aforementioned gene pairs/triple combinations lethal . interestingly, in a previous study a strong interaction between prs <dig> and prs <dig> as well as between prs <dig> and either prs <dig> or prs <dig> has been described  <cit> . in total, we fixed eleven gsls in the minimal medium and five in the yp medium by converting them to slsl consistencies by relying on literature vetted global modifications .

resolution of essl inconsistencies
the essl inconsistencies refer to cases where the model predicts that one or both of the genes are essential even though the experimental results show that they form a sl. based on the available data in literature, we identified  <dig> essls containing seven in silico essential genes in the minimal medium and nine essls containing five in silico essential genes in the yp medium . not surprisingly, all these in silico essential genes were part of the previously identified ngg mismatches for the single gene mutations. consequently, a direct resolution strategy to fix the essls is resolving the nggs for the single gene perturbations. following this route, we found that three essls in the minimal medium and one in the yp medium were automatically rectified and converted to slsls through the resolution of nggs . however, the rest of them were not resolved, instead they were converted into new gsl mismatches. except for one case, application of the methods discussed in the previous section for resolving gsl mismatches did not identify any global or literature supported correction strategies.

an interesting example of essl mismatches is the gene pair cho <dig>  and opi <dig>  where each gene is essential in vivo  <cit> . cho <dig> catalyzes the first step in conversion of pe_sc  to pc_sc  in phospholipid biosynthesis pathway , whereas, opi <dig> catalyzes the last two steps . we were not able to fix neither cho <dig> nor opi <dig> as separate nggs by any of the methods discussed previously. however, the fact that these two genes form a sl in vivo suggests that they may act as isozymes for reactions petohm_sc, mfaps_sc or pmetm_sc. interestingly, by mining the literature we found that previous studies have already demonstrated that opi <dig> can partially contribute as an isozyme in catalyzing reaction petohm_sc  <cit>  implying that the gpr for this reaction should be changed to . there were no reports implicating cho <dig> as an isozyme for catalyzing reactions mfaps_sc or pmetm_sc. however, previous studies have reported that s. cerevisiae is flexible with respect to phospholipid composition and can substitute pe_sc, ptdmeeta_sc  or ptd2meeta_sc  for pc_sc to a substantial extent  <cit> . in order to capture this lack of specificity we removed pc_sc from the biomass reaction and instead added a proxy phospholipid compound with the same stoichiometric coefficient as that for pc_sc. subsequently, we added four hypothetical reactions to the model that produce the phospholipid from any of pc_sc, pe_sc, ptdmeeta_sc or ptd2meeta_sc. note that these modifications to the model were all global and fixed the inconsistencies for opi <dig> as a ngg as well as  as an essl mismatch.

resolution of slg inconsistencies
the slg inconsistencies represent a mismatch where the two genes form an in silico sl, however, their simultaneous deletion results in a viable strain. slg mismatches for double gene perturbations can be viewed as ngg mismatches for single gene perturbations in the sense that they both imply that certain functionalities are missing in the model. the only difference between nggs and slgs is that the "no-growth" in nggs is due to the essentiality of single genes whereas in slgs it is the result of synthetic lethality of gene pairs. therefore, we simply adapt the same procedure that we used for fixing nggs to resolve slg inconsistencies.

we found and resolved one case of such an inconsistency in both minimal and yp media. this slg pertains to genes pgm <dig>  and pgm <dig>  that code for isozymes of reaction pgmt  involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. the simultaneous deletion of pgm <dig> and pgm <dig> is lethal based on the imm <dig> model since glygogen, a biomass precursor, cannot be produced in the absence of these two genes. application of the growmatch procedure to fix this slg, did not lead to any literature-supported correction strategy. we next mined the literature for a possible isozyme for this reaction and identified that gene pgm <dig>  is known to catalyze the interconversion of glucose-1-phophate to glucose-6-phosphate  <cit> , however, it is missing in the imm <dig> model. the addition of pgm <dig> to the gpr for reaction pgmt  renders the simultaneous deletion of pgm <dig> and pgm <dig> non-lethal.

resolution of sles inconsistencies
the sles mismatches denote cases where the model predicts that only the simultaneous deletion of both genes is lethal whereas one of the genes  is essential in vivo. this implies that deletion of one of these two genes cannot be compensated for by the other gene under the experimental conditions. therefore, sles inconsistencies are rectified by suppressing in the model the gene that is not essential in vivo. essential genes participating in in silico sls yield gng inconsistencies. therefore, the resolution of these gngs also fixes the sles mismatches for the double gene mutations. we identified  <dig> sles mismatches for the minimal medium and  <dig> for the yp medium. fifty one of these sless in the minimal and two in the yp medium were fixed by using the global modifications found for gngs. for example, gene ipp <dig>  which codes for ppa  forms a sl pair under both minimal and yp medium with gene ipp <dig>  that codes for the same reaction in mitochondria . however, ipp <dig> has been found to be essential in vivo  <cit> . therefore, to resolve this inconsistency, we conditionally suppress gene ipp <dig> under aerobic conditions. interestingly, by investigating the available expression data for these genes we found that the expression level of ipp <dig> under aerobic conditions with glucose as the carbon source is almost  <dig> times higher than that for ipp <dig>  <cit> , which may explain why ipp <dig> is not able to compensate for the deletion of ipp <dig> 

in another example, gene pgk <dig> , which is associated with reaction pgk  involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, participates in as many as  <dig> in silico sls under minimal medium. however, it has been found to be essential in vivo  <cit> . this implies that suppressing at least one of the  <dig> genes forming a synthetic lethal with pgk <dig> would resolve all these sless. although, we did not find any evidence confirming this resolution hypothesis for any of these genes except for pck <dig> , which is known to be suppressed in presence of glucose  <cit> : this gene is involved in gluconeogenesis, a process allowing yeast to synthesize glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors such as ethanol or glycerol. notably, suppression of pck <dig> in the imm <dig> model will block production of three biomass precursors, i.e., phe-l , trp-l  and tyr-l  in the absence of pgk <dig> 

overall, the resolution of model inconsistencies for double gene deletions improved the specificity of imm <dig> model from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  for the minimal medium and from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  for the yp medium. it is worth noting that these corrections are based on only the incomplete list of sl data available in literature.

auxotrophy inconsistencies
these mismatches refer to cases where the essentiality of single gene deletions or synthetic lethality of double gene knockouts are in agreements with in vivo observations, however, the model predictions for supplementation rescue  scenarios are inconsistent with experimental data. we found seven such these inconsistencies under minimal and five under yp medium, respectively, for correctly predicted essential genes, as well as four under both minimal and yp media for slsl predictions . notably, for all of these mismatches, the experimental results show that the single or double gene mutant strains can restore growth if additional compounds are added to the growth medium, while the model predictions imply that these genes remain essential or synthetic lethal even in the presence of these compounds. these inconsistencies can be treated in exactly the same way as the ngg or slg mismatches were treated, since they refer to the functionalities that are missing in the model but present under experimental conditions.

as an example, it has been reported that a strain containing the fol <dig>  deletion can grow if the medium is supplemented with folic acid  <cit> . nonetheless, folic acid is not included in the list of metabolites in imm <dig> model. by adding folic acid as well as exchange and transport reactions  to the imm <dig> model fol <dig> remains essential even though folic acid is allowed to be taken up. growmatch suggested addition of any of the two reactions r <dig>  or r <dig>  from the kegg database to the model so as to connect folic acid to rest of the network. interestingly, by searching the kegg database we found that the enzyme catalyzing these two reactions is present in yeast and the gene coding for this enzyme  is already present in the imm <dig> model.

the gene pair hmg <dig>  and hmg <dig> , which forms a slsl under both minimal and yp media. is an example of auxotrophy mismatches for double gene perturbations: although in vivo observations show that a mutant strain lacking these two genes can be rescued through addition of mev-r  to the growth medium  <cit> , in silico predictions imply that their double deletion is still lethal even in the presence of mev-r. the addition of an exchange and transport reaction between cytosol and extracellular environment for mev-r to the model resolves this auxotrophic inconsistency. notably, the addition of this import pathway for mev-r to the model also fixed the auxotrophy inconsistency for the essential gene erg <dig> , which is involved in mevalonate biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> corrections with supporting evidence to the imm <dig> metabolic model of yeast by using essentiality and synthetic lethality data. previous studies geared towards improving the predictive ability of metabolic models have used growth phenotype inconsistencies for single gene mutation experiments in microbial systems such as e. coli  <cit> . here, we go a step further by demonstrating the utility of synthetic lethality data for improving the accuracy of a multi-compartment metabolic model for a eukaryotic organism. this revealed missing or erroneously present metabolic functions in the model that could not be captured by only single gene perturbations. in addition, we found that in some cases fixing a mismatch for double gene deletions automatically fixes one or more mismatch for single gene perturbations. this was illustrated for the ngg, cho <dig> for which none of the mechanisms proposed to resolve the nggs were found to be successful. approximately, 20% of the total suggested corrections for the imm <dig> model use information from both single and double gene perturbations whereas 17% of them were exclusively discerned from double gene perturbations. a far larger contribution of synthetic lethals in providing model refinement strategies is thus expected as more synthetic lethality data are becoming available.

the high number of gng and gsl inconsistencies identified in this study runs contrary to the general perception that predictive inaccuracy of genome-scale metabolic models is primarily due to missing metabolic capabilities. it appears that the presence of not properly restricted to specific conditions functionalities in the model is the largest contributor to inconsistent predictions. application of growmatch to eliminate and/or properly regulate these functionalities led to the identification of  <dig> growth medium-specific regulatory constraints. these growth prediction inconsistency-based constraints complement existing regulatory constraints based on gene expression data  <cit> .

in this study we considered not only essentiality and synthetic lethality predictions but also disagreements in auxotrophy complementation. we also demonstrated that the identified growth-phenotype discrepancies are sometimes due to an incorrect or incomplete in silico description of the complex growth medium not the inaccuracy of the metabolic model. overall, we significantly improved the predictive capability  of the imm <dig> model for essentials and synthetic lethals by incorporating a minimum of  <dig>  suggested corrections. all of these modifications are global as they do not invalidate any of the correct model predictions. the proposed corrections span a wide array of changes to the model including relaxation of the irreversibility constraints on existing reactions in the model, adding new reactions, compounds or genes to the model, modifying the biomass equation, changing the gpr associations and medium-specific regulatory constraints. as we found independent corroborating evidence for the proposed corrections, the vast majority  of them remain relevant even for the latest update of the community yeast model   <cit> . this includes  <dig> model refinement strategies as well as  <dig> identified medium-specific regulatory constraints. of the remaining modifications to the imm <dig> model, twelve were also independently incorporated in yeast  <dig>  whereas five are different from the ones adopted in yeast  <dig> . a comparison of the suggested corrections with yeast  <dig>  is given in additional file  <dig> 

in addition to model refinement strategies with supporting evidence, we identified more than  <dig> other global modifications for which there was neither conflicting nor supporting evidence . these modifications can be treated as testable hypotheses for which experiments can be designed to prove/disprove their validity. overall, our study demonstrates the value of bringing to bear multi-gene deletion data to further improve the predictive capability of genome-scale metabolic models. the availability of high-throughput experimental techniques  <cit>  as well as efficient computational tools  <cit>  to elucidate synthetic lethal interactions opens the door to rapidly reveal additional model deficiencies. the model refinement approaches presented in this study are versatile enough to be employed for a wider range of experimental conditions  or synthetic lethal interactions of increasing size .
