BACKGROUND
dna microarray technology is a high throughput technique by which the expression of the whole genome is studied in a single experiment. in dual label experiments the fluorescent dyes cy <dig> and cy <dig> are used to label the two rna samples co-hybridized on a same array. recently two more dyes have been proposed  allowing the simultaneous hybridization of three or four samples. forster et al.  <cit>  have evaluated triple-target microarray by comparing results of single-target, dual-target and triple-target microarrays. they have concluded that the use of triple-target microarray is valid from an experimental point of view. one year later, staal et al.  <cit>  have investigated the four-target microarray experiments. their approach differs from that of  <cit> , but their conclusions are in fair agreement. their study has shown that alexa  <dig> is best suited as a third dye and that alexa  <dig> can be applied as a fourth dye on some microarray types. these extensions of the microarray technology are promising because they increase throughput, minimize costs and allow more powerful design of experiments. despite these advantages, triple-target microarrays are only sparsely used  <cit> . the lack of guidelines for designing these experiments and for normalizing more than two-color microarray data may be an explanation. recently woo et al.  <cit>  have proposed experimental designs for three and four-color gene expression microarrays. according to the previous work of  <cit> , the lowess procedure  <cit>  used to normalize data from two-color microarray is still applicable but it normalizes data sequentially because the ma-plot or the lowess correction is defined only for two dyes. consequently, application of such a normalization method does not globally correct the dye bias due to the three dyes. moreover the introduction of a third dye induces signal "bleeding". forster et al.  <cit>  have concluded that "it was considered as negligible between cy <dig> and cy <dig> signals, but seems to be important between alexa <dig> and cy <dig> signals," therefore signal cross-talk cannot be neglected.

we propose in this paper a normalization method for triple-target microarray experiments. first we quantify and correct the signal bleeding. then we correct the global dye bias using a generalized lowess procedure. triple-target experiments with arabidopsis thaliana microarrays are used to check if the proposed normalization is effective for correcting the dye bias. moreover the comparison of the statistical power of the triple-target experiment versus the usual two-color experiment is performed. all programs and data produced for this project are available under request.

RESULTS
bleeding
using the vocabulary of  <cit> , we call a channel, a blank channel when no material is hybridized for the associated dye. in theory, this blank channel should produce no signal values, and deviations from this show a bleeding phenomena from one dye-label to another. signal bleeding from one dye-labelled sample to another is a potential source of bias. indeed, bleeding artificially increases the signal in other channels of the same spot when the signal is high in one channel. assume that a gene is highly expressed in condition a and weakly expressed in condition b. the difference between the two conditions is decreased by the bleeding. therefore bleeding may induce a lowering in the statistical power for detecting differentially expressed genes. another possibility is that the bleeding effect induces a difference between two channels for the same gene: assume that a gene is highly expressed in condition a and equally expressed in conditions b and c; if the bleeding between the channel corresponding to condition a and the channel corresponding to condition b is higher than the bleeding between a and c, then a difference between signals b and c will appear, which is a technical artifact.

in order to investigate bleeding, we have made a "single target hybridization microarray experiment" where only one dye-labelled sample is hybridized . we also analyzed the single target hybridization data set from forster  <cit> .

experimental indications of the existence of bleeding
since cross-talks exist, we quantify then by using linear regression models. for example, when the sample is hybridized with alexa <dig> and cy <dig> and cy <dig> are the blank channels, the following models are used: gi = α <dig> + β1yi + εi and ri = α <dig> + β2yi + ε′i, where g, y and r stand respectively for green, yellow and red signals and i denotes the spot index. similar models are used with swapped dyes. estimation is performed using a robust method  to decrease the effect of outliers. table  <dig> contains the estimated parameters, which are low. this shows that the impact of bleeding on the signal is low. the greater coefficient is between cy <dig> and alexa <dig> . the weakness of the quantitative influence of bleeding is confirmed by the values of the standard error of the signal in the different channels: the values for the empty channels are between  <dig> and  <dig> times lower than the corresponding values for hybridized targets . these conclusions are made for only three dyes and two experimental platforms. it is possible that other dyes or other laser technologies induce a greater bleeding bias.

correction of bleeding
when there is a high level of bleeding it is necessary to correct it. a procedure is described in the methods section in order to fulfill this objective. it necessitates a preliminary experiment with three single-target slides. we have used the bleeding correction for the urgv dataset in the following studies. however the results obtained are very similar with and without bleeding correction, because the importance of bleeding is not sizeable, so the data have not been corrected for bleeding in the following studies.

note that the bleeding bias is cut down by a complete or partially dye-balanced experimental design, because the measure of the expression difference between two conditions is the mean of the individual measures of this difference taken on each slide. for example, if only one difference is distorted by the bleeding bias, its influence on the mean difference of expression is divided by the number of terms in the mean, which is equal to the number of slides containing the two conditions.

normalization of the dye bias
dye bias is a well characterized technical bias occuring in two-color microarray. it is mainly due to an incorporation difference between the two dyes. we refer to  <cit>  for details on this bias and also to  <cit>  for the gene-specific dye bias. this bias is the most important technical bias and must be corrected before any transcriptome data analysis. the most used method is the lowess correction proposed by  <cit> . in triple-target microarray, this bias also exists and must be corrected. unfortunately the lowess correction is defined only for two dyes. thus for the triple-target microarrays,  <cit>  used the lowess correction for three dye-label combinations per array: cy5/cy <dig>  cy5/alexa <dig> and cy3/alexa <dig>  however, this procedure does not allow a global correction of the dye bias. in this paper we propose a new method generalizing the lowess correction to correct the dye bias in one step.

let i =  <dig>  ⋯, n be the gene index , j =  <dig>  ⋯, p the channel index and, yij the log <dig> transformed intensity measure of gene i along the channel j. let y¯i=1p∑jyij, be the mean channel raw data for gene i on the log scale, and dij=yij−y¯i, the difference between channel j and the mean channel for gene i. we generalize the lowess method by modelling dij as follows

 dij=fj+eij 

and by estimating fj via a lowess. the value of the channel j after normalization of intensity dye-bias is defined by:

  y˜ij=yij−fj=y¯i+eij. 

we point out that if this normalization procedure is applied on a two-color microarray, it leads back to the usual lowess method. figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the result of the normalization procedure on an array issued from the forster triple-self dataset. figure  <dig> contains the plots showing the normalization function for each channel. in the context of two-color microarray, the ma-plot is the main graphical representation for visualizing the effect of the global dye-bias normalization. figure  <dig> contains the modified ma-plots for three dyes. in such plots, the x-axis coordinate is the mean intensity of the three channels y¯i and the y-axis coordinate is the difference between intensity of channel j and the mean intensity, dij=yij−y¯i. figure  <dig> contains the similar modified-ma-plots for the normalized data. the three usual ma-plot of the normalized data for each couple of dyes are represented in figure  <dig> 

validation of the normalization
the normalization procedure has to be validated on two points: first it must suppress or at least cut the technical bias and second it must not reduce the difference of expression between genes. we have used different experiments to check both points. we first use an analysis of variance  approach, and then a count of the number of differentially expressed genes.

analysis of variance of raw and normalized data
kerr et al.  <cit>  proposed to validate a given normalization method by analyzing the raw and the normalized data through the same anova model. a good normalization method should cut the sum of squares due to technical factors or interactions and should not decrease the sum of squares due to the interesting biological term under consideration, the gene-condition interaction. as expected, the normalization reduces all the technical biases and the gene-condition interaction is only slightly decreased. this proves that the normalization is effective .

number of genes declared differentially expressed
one way for checking the effciency of a normalization method is to analyze self-experiments, where only one sample is labeled with all the dyes and then hybridized on the same array. in such experiments, no differentially expressed gene is expected. differential analysis with varmixt  of the triple-self arrays of forster's experiment and of the urgv <dig> dataset gives no genes differentially expressed after normalization. a good normalization procedure should not decrease the true difference of expression between genes. we have compared the number of differentially expressed genes for two microarray experiments, studying three conditions:

 <dig>   <dig> triple-target microarrays 

 <dig>   <dig> two-color microarrays , a dye-swap for each comparison between two of the three conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
the proposed normalization procedure is effective: the number of false positives is under control, and the triple-target microarray experiments are more powerful than the corresponding two-color experiments.

there is thus room for improving the routine two-color microarray experiments. the normalization procedure proposed could be used for any number of channels p >  <dig>  so that it could be tested for four-target microarrays or used to evaluate the bleeding of alexa  <dig>
