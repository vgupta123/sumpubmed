BACKGROUND
aquareoviruses have been isolated from a wide variety of aquatic animals  <cit> . these viruses represent a great threat to the aquaculture industry in china and east asia. as a genus of the family reoviridae, viruses in aquareovirus have eleven-segmented dsrna genomes. the virus particles are icosahedral in symmetry and have a double-layered capsid. aquareoviruses have been divided into seven species  according to rna-rna blot hybridization or sequence comparison  <cit> . there are three aquareoviruses that have complete sequence information: grass carp reovirus , golden shiner reovirus , and american grass carp reovirus   <cit> . in addition, nearly complete sequence data was available for chum salmon reovirus  except for segment  <dig>  additionally, some other aquareoviruses have sequence information for parts of the genome segments. however, sequence and molecular data seems to be insufficient for comparing species in orthoreovirus, which was considered as the most related genus with aquareovirus  <cit> .

the family reoviridae contains fifteen genera of reoviruses with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> dsrna genome segments  <cit> . members in orthoreovirus  and aquareovirus make up the fusogenic reovirus, whose infection causes cell-cell fusion and the formation of a syncytium  <cit> . up to now, the nonstructural fusion associated small transmembrane  proteins represent the only known nonstructural viral proteins that induce cell-cell fusion; however, they are not directly related to virus entry or exit. a number of fast proteins have been identified in orthoreovirus and aquareovirus species, and the protein topology, structural motifs, and some key amino acids have also been identified  <cit> . thus, the identification of new fast proteins would help to the further elucidate their functions.

the only reported aquareovirus in china was grass carp reovirus , which was isolated from fresh-water grass carp. recently, a scophthalmus maximus reovirus  was isolated and identified from a diseased turbot. it is the first isolated aquareovirus from a marine fish in china. the complete genome sequence of smrev was determined and compared with other reoviruses. sequence and functional analysis also identified a fast protein that utilized a non-aug translation start site.

RESULTS
pathology, morphology, and the genome of smrev
smrev could cause a cytopathic effect  in grass carp fins  and in chinook salmon embryo  cell lines after 4- <dig> days incubation. the optimal temperature was 20°c. the cpe contained several separate plaques in which syncytia formed .

electron microscopy observations showed that the negatively stained virions had the typical morphology of aquareoviruses, including an inner nucleocapsid surrounded by double-layered capsids, and were about 70- <dig> nm in diameter . the biophysical and biochemical properties of smrev included resistance to heat, acid , and alkaline  treatment. treatment with chloroform or 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine  did not affect the viral infectivity.

the smrev genomes were purified and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. as shown in figure 1c, the genome segments were separated into  <dig> distinct bands, with segments  <dig> and  <dig> comigrating. comparison with the genome of gcrv- <dig> showed that migration of smrev genome segments was different from those of gcrv.

the complete sequences of segments 1- <dig> of smrev were obtained and have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers hm989930-hm <dig>  the lengths of smrev genome segments ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, with a total of  <dig> bp .

non-coding regions of smrev genome segments
as shown in table  <dig>  the lengths of smrev non-coding regions ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides at the 5' end and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides at the 3' end. the s <dig> genome segment had a non-coding region as long as  <dig> nucleotides at the 3' end, which was longer than the corresponding segment any other aquareoviruses so far sequenced.

conserved terminal nucleotide sequences have been considered as a feature in reovirus classification. comparison of the genome sequences of smrev showed that all of the segments had conserved terminal sequences. the conserved nucleotides 5'-guuuuau/g/a-3' were present at the 5' ends in all the positive strands of each segment and 5'-u/au/aucauc-3' was present at the 3' end. they were very similar to those of chsrv   and agcrv   . however, there were some differences between smrev and species in aqrv-c . interestingly, a newly isolated aquareovirus from grass carp showed a distinct terminal sequence at 5' end   <cit> . conserved terminal sequences could be used in genome assembly and packaging as "sorting" signals  <cit> .

moreover, the first and last nucleotides of each segment in all aquareoviruses were complementary . potential imperfect inverted repeats were also predicted in the sequences adjacent to each termini of the smrev positive-sense strand . it had been reported that complementary sequences in the 5' and 3' ncr could facilitate viral replication by circularizing the rna transcript  <cit> .

proteins encoded by genome segments s1-s <dig> and s8-s11
the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the core spike protein vp <dig>  which functions as the mrna capping enzyme. four conserved amino acids, two lysines and two histidines, were found in the n-terminus of vp <dig> . the vp <dig> proteins of smrev and gcrv shared a sequence identity of 44%  and were highly similar in their hydrophobic profiles.

the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the core protein vp <dig>  which is an rna-dependent rna polymerase . the catalytic domain of rdrp was identified between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> in vp <dig> by motifscan . previous research had identified five important motifs, motif a, b, c, d and e, in rdrp  <cit> . motif a , motif b , and motif c  were found in the predicted catalytic domain of smrev vp <dig>  amino acid alignments revealed that these motifs are also conserved in the rdrp proteins of aquareovirus and orthoreovirus species. moreover, a hydrophobic region was identified in the c-terminus of smrev vp <dig> that could be motif e of rdrp.

the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the core protein vp <dig>  which functions as a helicase and ntpase. a zinc finger c2h <dig> domain was identified in the smrev vp <dig> at amino acid positions 113- <dig>  which is known to bind rna. as revealed by cryo-em analysis, amino acids glu <dig>  ser <dig>  thr <dig>  and thr <dig> are involved in rna transcription in gcrv  <cit> . amino acid alignments showed that the four amino acids were conserved in mrv, gcrv, gsrv, and agcrv. however, the corresponding amino acids were glu, thr, thr, and thr in smrev and chsrv.

the s <dig> genome segment was predicted to encode the nonstructural protein ns <dig>  this segment was larger than its homologs in other aquareovirus species. the high percentage of g+c in the 5' portion and the complicated secondary structure of the genomic rna made it difficult to determine the complete sequence of this segment. in this study, reverse transcriptase that was stable at 65°c was used in 5' race to clone the 5' part of s <dig> genome segment. it was anticipated that ns <dig> was necessary to form viral inclusion bodies during virus infection, in which the virus genome replication and virion morphogenesis occurs. there were two coils  in ns <dig>  as predicted by coils program. sequence analysis also revealed that the corresponding ns <dig> proteins in aquareovirus species all contained the two coils regions, and conserved histidine and cysteine.

the s <dig> genome segment was predicted to encode the minor core protein vp <dig>  which is thought to be a nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase as a putative cofactor of vp <dig>  amino acid sequence alignments showed two conserved lysine residues  in smrev vp <dig>  which were also conserved in mrv, arv, and aquareovirus species except chsrv.

the s <dig> genome segment was predicted to encode the outer capsid protein vp <dig>  an autolytic cleavage site was predicted to be located between amino acid residues asn <dig> and pro <dig>  in addition, a myristoylation consensus sequence, which is essential for the autolytic cleavage, was located in the n-terminus of vp <dig>  sequence alignment revealed that the n-terminal sequence of vp <dig> in aquareovirus species was highly conserved.

the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the core protein vp <dig>  vp <dig> has an amino acids sequence identity of about 20% with the σ <dig> protein of mrv species . secondary structure predictions revealed that a large number of β-sheets and turns existed in the n-terminal portion  of smrev vp <dig>  which are characteristics of σ2/σa proteins in mrv and arv species  <cit> . however, there were some differences in the c-terminal regions between smrev vp <dig> and mrv σ <dig>  as revealed by hydrophobic analysis. most of the amino acid residues in the c-terminal regions of vp <dig> are hydrophobic; however, they are hydrophilic in σ <dig> 

the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the nonstructural protein ns <dig>  ns <dig> is thought to be involved in the formation of viral inclusion bodies with ns <dig>  the amino acids sequence identity between ns <dig> and mrv σns is lower than 20%, but they show a high similarity in secondary structure and in their hydrophobicity.

the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the major outer capsid protein vp <dig>  as the major outer capsid protein, vp <dig> had the most variability among aquareovirus species groups.

the s <dig> genome segment of smrev was predicted to encode the nonstructural protein ns <dig>  no equivalent proteins of ns <dig> were found in reovirus species other than aquareoviruses by blast analysis. an immunofluorescense assay showed that ns <dig> is distributed in the cytoplasm during smrev infection .

genome segment s <dig> encodes a fast protein
initial orf analysis by editseq in dnastar software showed that smrev genome segment s <dig> contained only one orf, which started from an aug codon at nucleotide  <dig>  however, except for chsrv, the s <dig> segment in aquareoviruses usually contains more than one orf. to determine the orfs contained by smrev s <dig>  different recombinant plasmids that contained all or part of the s <dig> segment cdna were constructed and expressed in fish cell lines. when the entire s <dig> segment cdna was expressed, cultured fish cells formed syncytia in which the nucleus aggregated . however, the expression of cdna  did not cause cell-cell fusion . cells expressing cdna  formed syncytia . this indicated that the 5' part of the smrev s <dig> segment encoded a protein that could cause cell-cell fusion and was translated from a non-aug translation start site. furthermore, expression of s <dig> cdna  and cdna  could induce cell-cell fusion , but no cell-cell fusion occurred when cdnas  and  were expressed. in addition, a point mutation at nucleotide  <dig>  did not influence the ability to form syncytia. however, syncytium formation was ablated by a point mutation at nucleotide  <dig>  . considering the consensus sequence  of the non-aug start site  <cit>  and the sequence  near the nucleotide position  <dig> of s <dig> segment, it can be concluded that smrev s <dig> segment encoded a protein from a cug translation start site. this orf starts from a cug codon at nucleotides 17- <dig> and is terminated by uga at nucleotides 611- <dig> 

thus, the s <dig> genome segment of smrev contained more than one orf. the first orf encoded the fast protein ns <dig> and the second orf was predicted to encode a nonstructural protein, ns <dig> 

fusogenic proteins in smrev and gcrv
in addition to ns <dig> of smrev, the ns <dig> protein encoded by the first orf  of the s <dig> genome segment of gcrv- <dig> was also identified here as a fast protein. in vitro expression of ns <dig> in fish cells induced syncytium formation . expression of ns16-egfp recombinant protein also induced syncytium formation, while ns16-egfp was distributed in the fused cells . hydrophobic analysis by protscale  revealed that ns <dig> and ns <dig> had a similar hydropathy profile . however, there were some differences in the motifs contained in ns <dig> and ns <dig>  a myristoylation consensus sequence  was found in the n-terminus of ns <dig>  but, surprisingly, no myristoylation site was predicted to exist in ns <dig>  it had been reported that n-terminal myristoylation was necessary for the fusion activity of reptilian reovirus  p <dig> protein  <cit> . ns <dig> and ns <dig> were both predicted to contain a transmembrane domain  by tmpred  <cit> . following the tm domain, there are regions that contain a stretch of basic amino acid residues  in both proteins . the polybasic regions are thought to support the translocation of the n-terminal domain  into face the extracellular environment  <cit> . besides the tm domain, another hydrophobic region, the hydrophobic patch , was predicted to exist in the c-terminal fragment of both proteins . moreover, there are two regions that are rich in arginine, proline, and histidine  in ns <dig> . however, there are three rph domains in the fast protein of asrv- <dig>  <cit> , despite its high sequence similarity with smrev ns <dig> 

comparison with other reovirus species and phylogenetic analysis
comparison of the electropherotype of smrev in agarose gel electrophoresis with those reported from other aquareoviruses  <cit>  revealed that the electropherotype of smrev was similar to the members in aqrv-a. interestingly, it was different to the electropherotype of trv, which was isolated from turbot in spain  <cit> .

the genome sequence and deduced amino acids were compared to the sequences available from other aquareoviruses. smrev had a larger m <dig> genome  segment than other sequenced aquareoviruses . overall identity values between smrev and other aquareoviruses homologous proteins ranged from 13% to 94%. the highest identity was between smrev and species in aqrv-a, for example, chsrv, which ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. however, the chsrv genome sequence information lacked the complete m <dig> segment .

the genes and proteins of smrev were compared with their homologs from reovirus species other than aquareoviruses. the results showed that smrev had a high similarity with species in orthoreovirus . the highest amino acid sequence identities  between smrev and orthoreovirus species  were observed in the rna-dependent rna polymerase  . a phylogenetic tree among members of fourteen genera of reoviridae, for whom sequence information was available, was constructed based on the rdrp sequences . the genus aquareovirus was clustered more closely with the orthoreovirus. interestingly, as shown in figure 5a, several genus groups that have different genome segments numbers and hosts have a relatively close evolutionary relationship. for example, members from the genus cardoreovirus and seadornavirus were closely clustered. members from the genus cypovirus and dinovernavirus were also closely clustered. in addition, there were two subfamilies in reoviridae: spinareovirinae and sedoreovirinae. members in spinareovirinae are turreted reoviruses, which have turrets situated on the virus core structure. members in sedoreovirinae are non-turreted reoviruses. two large species groups also existed in the present phylogenetic analysis. on the left side of figure 5a , are members in spinareovirinae. members in sedoreovirinae are clustered on the right side of figure 5a.

as the viral major outer capsid protein, vp <dig> is the most variable protein in aquareoviruses. a phylogenetic tree was constructed with vp <dig> amino acid sequences in aquareoviruses. it showed that smrev was most related to viruses in aqrv-a  . interestingly, the viruses from hosts that had a seawater life history were closely related , and were different from those whose hosts lived in fresh water .

discussion
putative functions of proteins revealed by motif comparison
it has been reported that the four conserved amino acids  in vp <dig> are essential amino acids for the guanylyltransferase activity of the homologous proteins in mrv, arv , and gcrv  <cit> . several functional domains were also identified in gcrv vp <dig> by cryoem analysis, such as the gtpase domain, the methyltransferase domain, and the immunoglobulin domain  <cit> .

the two lysine residues in vp <dig> are essential for atpase activity in homologous protein μa of arv  <cit> . by comparison with the proteins from mrv and arv, vp <dig> was thought to be a nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase and a putative cofactor of vp <dig> 

the autolytic cleavage site, asn <dig> and pro <dig>  which allowed the protein to be cleaved during virus infection to produce an n-terminal fragment and a c-terminal fragment  <cit> , was identified as smrev vp <dig>  previous research reported that vp <dig> and vp <dig> formed heterodimers to form the outer capsid in gcrv  <cit> . in the early stage of infection, the outer capsid is proteolytically cleaved and disassembled to form the infectious subviral particles , which have enhanced infectivity  <cit> .

viral inclusions, or viral factories, are formed in the cytoplasm during reovirus infection. it has been reported that mrv nonstructural proteins μns and σns form viral inclusion bodies in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . based on sequence comparisons, it was anticipated that smrev ns <dig> had a function in forming viral inclusions along with ns <dig>  the two coils structure in ns <dig> was thought to be essential for viral inclusions formation. conserved histidines and cysteines between the two coil regions are also important for inclusion formation in mrv and arv  <cit> . in addition, the n-terminal amino acid residues in ns <dig> were predicted to form an alpha-helix, which could be important for nucleoprotein complex formation in the σns protein  <cit> .

moreover, the second orf of s <dig> segment in mrv encodes the σc protein, which is a structural protein and is involved in cell attachment  <cit> . however, the protein corresponding to σc in aquareovirus species is a nonstructural protein  <cit> .

fast proteins of aquareoviruses with different translation start sites
sequence and structural analysis agreed with the previous report that there were two types of fast proteins in aquareoviruses  <cit> . one type comprises the ns <dig> proteins encoded by gcrv, gsrv , and agcrv . the other type comprises the ns <dig> proteins encoded by smrev and asrv- <dig> . the fast proteins of smrev and asrv- <dig> use a non-canonical translation start site. there are some differences in the motifs in the two types of fast proteins . racine et al. reported that ns <dig> could be a homolog of the reptilian orthoreovirus  p <dig> fast protein. however, p <dig> contains an n-terminal myristoylation site that is essential for fusion activity  <cit> . sequence analysis found no n-terminal myristoylation site in ns <dig>  this indicated that ns <dig> could not be a homolog of rrv p <dig>  the sequence comparison also showed that the motif and structural arrangements of ns <dig> were more similar with arv p <dig> fast protein  <cit> . further analysis of the functions of each motif could facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms involved in syncytium formation and the evolution of fast proteins.

non-aug translation start codons have been reported in many organisms, including viruses  <cit> , such as the sendai virus  <cit>  and the moloney murine leukemia virus   <cit> . recently, a cug start codon was identified in asrv- <dig>  which was utilized for translating a fast protein  <cit> . the non-canonical start site  used in fast proteins could be a strategy by which the translation efficiency is regulated. inefficient expression of fast proteins could reduce the rate of cell-cell fusion and facilitate the production of viral progeny. in addition, the start codon of the fast protein of gcrv  is aug; however, the nucleotide sequence around this aug site  did not accord with the kozak consensus sequence . this also indicated that ns <dig> could be translated with relatively low efficiency.

taxonomic status of smrev and evolution analysis
aquareoviruses have been divided into seven aquareovirus species groups   <cit> . the division of the different aquareovirus species groups was based on electropherotype, serological comparison, the ability to reassort during mixed infections, conserved terminal sequences, and rna sequence analyses. genome electrophoresis, and gene and protein comparison revealed that smrev could be a member of species group aqrv-a. interestingly, turbot reovirus , which was isolated from spain, was classified in species group aqrv-e by rna-rna hybridization  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis indicated that the evolution of vp <dig> was affected by selective pressure from the host organisms. evolution of aquareoviruses was closely related to the environment in which the host organisms lived. the family reoviridae contains a large number of members that infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi. members in aquareovirus and orthoreovirus have a common evolutionary origin with those from mycoreovirus and coltivirus, cypovirus, and dinovernavirus. it is interesting that viruses from vertebrates and fungi have a common ancestor. these genera comprise viruses that have genome segments ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  it has been speculated that reoviruses diverged from a common ancestor may have gained or lost a genome segment that was required or not in different hosts during the course of evolution  <cit> . in this case, the s <dig> segment in aquareovirus species that has no equivalent in orthoreovirus may be involved in virus-host interactions. moreover, the model of genetic "jump", which involves changes in the number of genome segments, has been reported between the rotaviruses and the seadornaviruses, and between the aquareoviruses and the coltiviruses  <cit> . this model involves a process in which a single segment undergoes duplication and deletion to generate two separate segments. in this case, the s <dig> segment of aquareoviruses corresponds to segments  <dig> and  <dig> of coltiviruses.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study provided the complete genome sequence of a newly isolated turbot reovirus from china. it is the first complete sequence of an aquareovirus from marine fish. amino acids comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggested that smrev is a new aquareovirus in the species group aquareovirus a. phylogenetic relationships among aquareoviruses revealed that vp <dig> could be used as a reference to divide the aquareovirus from freshwater hosts from those from marine hosts. based on the complete genome sequence, a fast protein with a non-aug start site was identified, which partially contributed to the cytopathic effect caused by viral infection. these results provide new insights into the virus-host or virus-environment interactions.
