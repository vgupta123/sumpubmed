BACKGROUND
being a fast growing, non-pathogenic mycobacteria, mycobacterium smegmatis has been widely used as a model organism to study the biology of other virulent and extremely slow growing species like m. tuberculosis. the genome of m. smegmatis, as listed at the tigr site, contains a large number of putative gntr-like regulators. these regulators play an important role in the cellular physiology. many such regulators are involved in regulation of gene expression in response to various oxidized substrates related to either amino acid metabolism or at the branch points of various other metabolic pathways.

the gntr family of bacterial regulators is named after the bacillus subtilis transcription regulator- gntr- a repressor of the gluconate operon  <cit> . regulators of this family possess a conserved n-terminal domain that is involved in the dna binding. based on this conservation, these proteins can easily be recognized by a conserved domain database  search  <cit> . however, the c-terminal domain, which is involved in the effector binding and/or oligomerization , is quite diverse and heterogeneous. as a consequence of this heterogeneity, the gntr regulators have been further classified into six subfamilies   <cit> . the members of subfamilies possess conserved secondary structural features specific to their subfamily and interact with a limited number of molecules  <cit> . considering these conserved secondary structural features in sequence analysis, gntr regulators are defined as a part of specific subfamily  <cit> . earlier, we have characterized gntr regulators from m. tuberculosis  <cit> . in present study putative gntr regulators from m. smegmatis are classified into their specific subfamilies. further, suitable orthologs of the m. smegmatis gntrs were also identified using reciprocal blast searches in m. tuberculosis, m. avium, m. bovis, m. ulcerans, m. sp. kms, m. sp. mcs, m. vanbaalenii pyr- <dig> and b. subtilis. to identify the dna targets of these regulators, we utilized the information about the nucleotide preferences for regulators of a given subfamily. all the upstream dna sequences of the gntr coding genes were scanned to locate potential palindromes that matched the nucleotide preference criteria  <cit> .

RESULTS
classification of the putative m. smegmatis gntrs into subfamilies
unrooted tree of the m. smegmatis gntrs was constructed with the classified representatives of all subfamilies   <cit> . among all putative m. smegmatis gntrs two proteins  were found to be identical in sequence, hence only one of them msmeg_ <dig> was taken for the classification. each branch of the constructed tree represents a subfamily. bootstrapping, involving  <dig> replicates, shows all subfamily branches clustered with high bootstrap values. fadr subfamily is divided into two groups, fadr and vanr .

fadr-like proteins of m. smegmatis
of all the putative gntrs,  <dig> proteins were classified as the fadr-like regulators. these subfamily members are further classified into two groups fadr and vanr where the c-terminal effector binding and/or oligomerization domain length is about  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues respectively comprising all α-helices  <cit> . among all fadr-like regulators,  <dig> regulators were clustered as members of the fadr group while  <dig> for the vanr group . to study secondary structural features both the group members were dealt with separately. c-terminal domain of all the members of fadr group were predicted with seven α-helices except msmeg_ <dig>  all the regulators showed distinguishable predicted secondary structural features specific to this subfamily   <cit> . secondary structural patterns of the regulator msmeg_ <dig> revealed an extra secondary structural element, which could be significant in studying protein family evolution. fadr-like regulators are known to be involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to oxidized substrates related to either amino acid metabolism or at the branch point in various metabolic pathways such as glycolate  <cit> , pyruvate  <cit> , lactate  <cit> , malonate  <cit>  or gluconate  <cit> . one of fadr-like classified transcriptional regulator msmeg_ <dig> is known to be involved in the regulation of piperidine and pyrrolidine metabolism  <cit> . these results provide a starting point for a detailed biochemical and genetic characterization of m. smegmatis fadr-like regulators.

hutc-like proteins of m. smegmatis
contrary to the fadr-like regulators, the regulators of this subfamily consist of both α-helices and β-sheet structures in the c-terminal domain. we identified eight gntrs as members of this subfamily . all these members showed distinguishable predicted secondary structural features specific to this subfamily   <cit> . these regulators are known to acquire the same protein fold as escherichia coli ubic; hence it is also named as ubic transcription regulator-associated  domain  <cit> . this effector-binding domain responds to various ligands like histidine   <cit> , long chain fatty acids  <cit> , trehalose 6-phosphate  <cit>  or alkylphosphonate  <cit> . a range of known ligands, specific to many hutc-like regulators, will help in characterizing the classified m. smegmatis regulators.

mocr-like protein of m. smegmatis
among all the putative gntr regulators, eight were classified as members of the mocr subfamily . all the eight regulators showed distinguishable predicted secondary structural features specific to this subfamily   <cit> . mocr-like regulators show homology to the class i aminotransferase proteins  <cit> , which requires pyridoxal 5'-phosphate  as a co-factor. all mocr-like regulators exhibit a plp attachment site with a conserved lysine residue, which is also evident in the classified mocr-like regulators . it would thus be interesting to study the role of pyridoxal phosphate regulation in the classified regulators.  <cit> .

ytra-like protein of m. smegmatis
the ytra subfamily is the least represented gntr-like regulator in the bacterial genomes. among all m. smegmatis gntr regulators, only one regulator msmeg_ <dig>  showed the signatures of the ytra subfamily member . ytra possesses a reduced c-terminal domain with only two α-helices. the average length of the putative effector binding and/or oligomerization domain is about  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . ytra from b. subtilis is an experimentally explored regulator, which is part of a large self-regulated operon. this operon consists of genes encoding the atp binding cassette  transport systems in addition to the ytra  <cit> . it would be interesting to study further, whether msmeg_ <dig> has any role in modulating such an operon.

operator/binding site analysis
we have tabulated a list of potential operator sites near the perfect palindrome sequence with conserved residues, which are found to be specific for most of the subfamily members   <cit> . we did not find an operator sequence in the upstream sequences of all the remaining regulators. all the predicted sites were found to be in the upstream region from the translation start site except msmeg_ <dig>  identification of these sites is an important step to understand the gntr associated regulon or the gene regulatory network in the genome  <cit> .

ortholog prediction
we have found a number of m. smegmatis gntr regulators that are orthologs of proteins from the other species of mycobacteria and b. subtilis . as orthologs typically share the same function, these regulators could serve as a model to study homologues from the other species of mycobacteria. these characterized orthologs may provide clues for initiating detailed biochemical characterization of m. smegmatis proteins. many putative orthologs were experimentally known like rv0165c that is involved in regulation of mce <dig> operon  <cit> ; gntr, a transcriptional repressor of gluconate operon  <cit> ; ycbg, involved in utilization of d-glucarate and d-galactarate  <cit> ; ycnf, involved in utilization of gamma-aminobutyrate  <cit> . however, we did not find the orthologs for all m. smegmatis gntrs in other pathogenic species.

'-' represents, corresponding orthologs are not present in the genome. m.smeg – m. smegmatis; m.tub – m. tuberculosis; m.aviump. – m. avium para.; m.bov – m. bovis; m.van – m. vanbaalenii pyr-1; m.spmcs – m. sp. mcs;m.spkms – m. sp. kms; m.ulc – m. ulcerans; b.sub – b. subtilis.

our results help in extending the annotation of gntrs encoded in the m. smegmatis genome. we have classified putative m. smegmatis gntrs into four subfamilies. though in the present study, we have made an attempt to explore m. smegmatis gntr regulators, this approach could also be effectively employed to extend the gntr family classification in other bacterial species as well.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis has shown that m. smegmatis is equipped with large number of gntr-like regulators, belonging to four subfamilies. it further suggests that the gntr regulatory repertoires of m. smegmatis are far more complex than in m. tuberculosis. indeed, additional gntr regulators possibly control a subset of genes required for adapting to a range of environmental conditions. one of the fadr-like regulators shows additional secondary structural elements, suggesting a possible origin of a new group within the fadr subfamily. identified orthologs from m. smegmatis could serve as a model to decipher molecular regulation events taking place in the pathogenic mycobacteria. potential operator sites were also identified based on the nucleotide recognition preferences of gntr-like regulators.
