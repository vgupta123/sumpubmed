BACKGROUND
penicillin-binding proteins  are responsible for the final synthesis steps of the universal peptidoglycan exoskeleton of bacteria. since their initial identification by brian spratt  <cit>  most attention has been paid to the activities of these proteins in model microorganisms such as escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus pneumoniae.

the rise in resistance to β-lactam antibiotics and the diversity of the mechanisms involved, including modification of the target pbps often seen in gram-positive pathogens, has resulted in increased interest in this group of proteins.

listeria monocytogenes causes relatively infrequent but often very serious food-borne infections termed listerioses, with mortality rates that can reach 25-30%  <cit> . newborns and immunocompromised individuals are at special risk, and in these cases controlling the infection with antimicrobial agents can potentially be hindered due to the emergence of l. monocytogenes isolates with reduced susceptibility to ampicillin  <cit> .

the penicillin-binding proteins  of l. monocytogenes were first identified by vicente et al.  <cit>  using radiolabeled β-lactams, and it was subsequently suggested that pbp <dig> is the primary lethal target of these antibiotics  <cit> . however, as in many other bacteria, the exact mechanism of β-lactam-induced cell death remains unknown. there have been a limited number of reports dealing with the pbps of l. monocytogenes. earlier studies carried out in our laboratory - when only five pbps were known - resulted in a re-estimation of the copy number of individual l. monocytogenes penicillin-binding proteins  <cit>  and elucidation of the enzymatic properties of pbp <dig>  and pbp <dig>   <cit> . a different approach to studying the penicillin-binding proteins of l. monocytogenes was made possible by the availability of the complete genome sequence of this bacterium  <cit> . the insertional mutagenesis of genes encoding seven potential pbps -two of class a, three of the high molecular mass  class b and two of the low molecular mass  type - helped to clarify their role  <cit> .

in the present study we have positively identified eight penicillin-binding proteins in whole cell extracts of l. monocytogenes, and another lmm pbp  was characterized by the bocillin-fl -binding ability of the purified recombinant protein.

RESULTS
detection and identification of l. monocytogenes pbps
the "surfaceome" of the model l. monocytogenes strain egde has been annotated  <cit>  and recently revised  <cit> . it includes proteins involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan. examination of sequence information from a database dedicated to the analysis of the genomes of l. monocytogenes  and its non-pathogenic relative listeria innocua  http://genolist.pasteur.fr/listilist, as well as that from the pfam database http://www.sanger.ac.uk/software/pfam and information from the ncbi conserved domain database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cog/ and the interpro database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/, has identified  <dig> putative genes for pbps, classified according to molecular class .

pbps form a covalent complex with β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . when fluorescent β-lactams are employed, these proteins can be visualized immediately following sds-page  <cit> . total protein from whole cells or a cell wall extract of l. monocytogenes egd were incubated with different concentrations of boc-fl, bocillin- <dig>  or ampicillin-alexa <dig>  for  <dig> min at 37°c. the highest affinity binding was obtained with boc-fl and bands identified using this compound in the whole cell assay are shown in figure  <dig>  pbps a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig>  d <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were also identified with boc- <dig> and amp- <dig> . two types of non-specific band were also observed  and they represent the natural intrinsic fluorescence of other proteins in the cell extract. however, the bands that are absent in lane  <dig>  compared with lane  <dig>  represent specific pbps. those bands that completely disappeared , partially disappeared  or remained present  reflect total, partial and no binding of ampicillin, respectively. the results of an experiment examining saturation with  <dig> μm boc-fl, the binding capacity of each pbp for boc-fl and the affinity of the pbps for ampicillin  are presented in table  <dig>  these assays involved incubation of whole cell with ampicillin followed by a similar incubation with boc-fl. therefore, only those pbps with no or low affinity for ampicillin would be able to bind boc-fl during the second incubation. the deacylation rate for the pbps is actually extremely low, which permitted their detection in the gel for several hours after binding. boc-fl binding to pbps b <dig> and d <dig> was completely inhibited by amp at  <dig> μg/ml, and these two pbps exhibited high  and medium  affinity for boc-fl, respectively. pbps a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> showed low affinity  for boc-fl.

characterization of protein lmo <dig> 
gene lmo <dig> was amplified by pcr from the wild-type egd strain and cloned in vector pet30a without its putative lipobox signal peptide. expression of the his-tagged fusion protein in e. coli bl <dig> cells was induced with iptg and it was purified from cell lysates on a nickel affinity column. the recombinant lmo <dig> protein was eluted from the column by washes with  <dig> and  <dig> mm imidazole. these two fractions were combined and further purified on a desalting column, yielding  <dig> mg/ml of pure protein.

the purified protein was incubated with different concentrations of boc-fl . saturation binding studies showed that lmo <dig> covalently bound boc-fl, indicating that the recombinant protein retained its authentic activity. lmo <dig> was the major band on gels, with a slower migrating minor band thought to represent a dimeric form .

the names of the bands are indicated on the right, and the positions of the molecular weight markers are shown on the left.

the β-lactam binding capacity of lmo <dig> was evaluated with three different fluorescent antibiotics: boc-fl, boc- <dig> and amp- <dig>  the purified protein was able to bind these compounds with apparent affinity constants  of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively.

since most lmm pbps are dd-carboxypeptidases, the enzymatic activity of lmo <dig> was characterized in an in vitro assay using the synthetic tripeptide nα,nε-diacetyl-lys-d-ala-d-ala at concentrations of up to  <dig>  mm as substrate with  <dig> μg of purified protein. the maximum activity was  <dig>  pmoles/μg min, indicating low dd-carboxypeptidase activity under these assay conditions.

no β-lactamase activity could be detected in assays performed using the purified protein .

the hydrolysis of whole peptidoglycan and purified natural muropeptides was also analyzed, but no such enzymatic activity was detected when the purified lmo <dig>  was incubated for up to  <dig> h in the presence of  <dig> μg of whole peptidoglycan or up to  <dig> μg of the natural dimeric muropeptide d <dig> . however, lmo <dig> was found to cleave the peptide bond between the subterminal and terminal d-alanine moieties  of the pentapeptide side chain of the monomeric muropepeptide m <dig>  to convert the pentapeptide into a tetrapeptide m <dig> . no such cleavage occurred in the absence of lmo <dig> 

the ph-dependence of the activity of lmo <dig> against monomeric muropepeptide m <dig> was determined in the ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the highest activity was detected in assays performed at ph  <dig>  in a tris-mg buffer, where half of the substrate was converted to the tetrapeptide .

construction of single and double penicillin-binding protein mutants
allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to create in-frame deletions in the lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> genes, which encode the penicillin-binding proteins lmo <dig>  and pbp <dig> , respectively. dna fragments representing regions near the 5' and 3' ends of the genes were independently amplified, spliced, and inserted into the e. coli - l. monocytogenes shuttle vector pksv <dig> to generate derivatives pkd <dig> and padpbp <dig>  carrying the spliced regions of the lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> genes, respectively. l. monocytogenes cells transformed with these constructs were grown for several generations in tsbye broth at 30°c in the presence of chloramphenicol to select for chromosomal integration of the plasmids. excision of chromosomally-integrated plasmids was facilitated by repeated growth in the absence of antibiotic pressure, and a subsequent shift in the growth temperature was used to cure the cells of the excised plasmids. colonies grown on tsbye plates were screened for loss of chloramphenicol resistance and several sensitive clones were then examined by pcr to identify those in which an allelic exchange event had resulted in chromosomal replacement of the wild-type copy of the gene with the mutant allele. this first round of allelic exchange mutagenesis led to the isolation of the derivative l. monocytogenes kd <dig>  which had a 627-bp deletion in the lmo <dig> gene.

the kd <dig> single mutant was used in a second round of allele replacement mutagenesis, which began with the transformation of this strain with plasmid padpbp <dig>  completion of the mutagenesis procedure led to the isolation of a double-mutant strain, l. monocytogenes ad <dig>  which had a 627-bp deletion in the lmo <dig> gene and a 1113-bp deletion in the lmo <dig>  gene.

characterization of kd <dig> and ad <dig> mutant strains
to examine the effect of pbp deletion on cell growth rate, the doubling times of cultures of egd, kd <dig> and ad <dig> were determined. the doubling time of the wild-type strain grown at 37°c was  <dig> min, whereas those of the single and double mutants were  <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively. these data indicate that the single and double pbp deletion strains grew significantly slower  than egd. the doubling time of the double mutant was also significantly different from that of kd <dig>  thus, although the bacteria were viable in the absence of lmo <dig> and pbp <dig>  they grew more slowly than the wild-type.

to determine the effect of these mutations on cell morphology, the strains egd, kd <dig> and da <dig> were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy . as cells of the mutant strains displayed irregular morphology when grown at 42°c , the cell lengths were only determined when the strains were grown at  <dig> and 37°c. cells of the l. monocytogenes strains lacking lmo <dig> were significantly longer than those of the wild-type  . at 30°c the average cell length compared to strain egd was increased by  <dig> % in strain kd <dig> and by  <dig> % in the double mutant strain. the respective values at 37°c were  <dig> % and 43%. the populations of the single and double mutant strains also showed some variation in cell morphology. a proportion of the cells of strain kd <dig> showed an altered phenotype at each of the tested temperatures. the variant cells were characteristically curved with a bend at either one or both ends and subterminal constrictions. the number of cells with altered morphology was increased as the growth temperature was raised . cell bending was more pronounced in the population of ad <dig> mutant cells . more than 90% of cells of the double mutant exhibited irregular morphology at 42°c. to determine whether disruption of the pbp-encoding genes had an impact on the β-lactam resistance of l. monocytogenes, microdilution mic tests were performed. the results demonstrated that the lack of functional lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> genes had little effect on the sensitivity of the mutant strains to the panel of β-lactam antibiotics tested . similar results were found for a mutant of l. monocytogenes lacking pbp <dig>  examined in a previous study  <cit> .

to compare the murein of l. monocytogenes mutants kd <dig> and ad <dig> with that of the wild-type strain, muropeptides were released from isolated peptidoglycan by complete digestion with muramidase and the reduced muropeptides were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography  to that obtained for wild-type l. monocytogenes, but that of the double mutant was markedly different . comparison of the peptidoglycan profiles of the wild-type strain and ad <dig>  indicated that both the composition and relative amount of a number of muropeptides were dramatically altered. all of the well characterized muropeptides identified in the murein of strain egd, with tripeptide side chains in monomers or cross-linked muropeptides , were dramatically decreased or entirely absent in the double mutant. furthermore, a number of novel muropeptides  were detected in ad <dig> pepidoglycan. peaks b <dig> and b <dig> may correspond to monomers with a disaccharide-pentapeptide structure, while b3-b <dig> may represent different forms of a dimer - a bis-disaccharide penta-tetra  <cit> .

discussion
previous analyses  <cit>  of the l. monocytogenes cell membrane identified only five proteins able to bind i125-penicillinx, h3-benzylpenicillin, s35-penicillin or i125-ampicillin , which correspond to pbpa <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  a <dig> and d <dig>  respectively. in silico analysis of the l. monocytogenes genome revealed the presence of ten open reading frames that potentially encode penicillin-binding proteins  <cit> . we believe that the present study is the first to have used fluorescently labeled antibiotics  to identify the pbps of l. monocytogenes. with this method, we were able to identify eight pbps, both in whole cell and membrane extracts. pbpb <dig>  encoded by the gene lmo <dig>  was classified as a subclass b <dig> pbp  <cit> . all pbps in this subclass, e.g. pbp2a of staphylococcus aureus and pbp <dig> of enterococcus faecium, are thought to exhibit low affinity for penicillin  <cit> . we found that pbpb <dig> also has low affinity for all the β-lactams tested. a recent study of seven l. monocytogenes genes encoding potential penicillin-binding proteins showed that interruption of the lmo <dig> gene resulted in increased susceptibility of strain egde to β-lactams  <cit> . it was concluded that protein lmo <dig>  may play a central role in the β-lactam resistance of l. monocytogenes  <cit> . we identified two additional lmm pbps, pbpc <dig> and pbpc <dig>  which contain a β-lactamase class c domain. pbpc <dig> is predicted to be located at the surface of the bacterium, while pbpc <dig> lacks any recognized cell surface association domain  <cit> . however, we detected both proteins in intact cells, which indicates that some physical interaction of pbpc <dig> with the cell wall must exist.

the product of gene lmo <dig>  lmo <dig> , was not found to bind β-lactams with any of the various methods employed and consequently cannot be considered a pbp.

lmo <dig> , a low molecular mass pbp, has been identified as a class c type  <dig> protein related to the peptidase s <dig> family  <cit> . as lmo <dig> was not observed in boc-fl-, boc-650- and amp-430-labeled extracts, it seemed possible that it does not bind β-lactam antibiotics. however, β-lactam binding experiments with purified recombinant protein demonstrated that lmo <dig> does bind the three different fluorescent antibiotics efficiently. the apparent affinity constants  for boc-fl, boc- <dig> and amp- <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively. the absence of an observable band corresponding to lmo <dig> following sds-page of the boc-fl-labeled listerial extract cannot be due to lack of interaction with the β-lactam. this result suggests that l. monocytogenes grown in culture expresses this protein at a very low level. it has recently been shown that the two-component system cesrk controls the transcriptional induction of lmo <dig>  the expression of lmo <dig> is positively regulated by cesr and inducible with ethanol and cefuroxime  <cit> . on the other hand, we were able to identify protein lmo <dig> in a whole cell extract using fluorescent-labelled antibiotics, and the expression of this pbp is also dependent on cesr  <cit> .

bacteria often have a major type- <dig> pbp which represents the most abundant lmm pbp they produce. the most highly expressed pbp in listerial membranes is pbp <dig>  in a previous study we confirmed that pbp <dig> is a dd-carboxypeptidase that preferentially degrades low-molecular-weight substrates  <cit> . in the present study we found that pbp <dig> is also a protein with a high affinity for β-lactams.

l. monocytogenes produces one more type- <dig> pbp - lmo <dig> - but its role in cell wall biosynthesis and catalytic activity had not previously been examined. in this study, recombinant lmo <dig> was expressed in e. coli and purified in order to characterize its enzymatic activity and role in cell physiology. lmo <dig> lacking its signal sequence was expressed as a his-tagged fusion protein in the cytoplasm of e. coli, which allowed the purification of large amounts of functionally active protein.

type- <dig> pbps, with the exception of s. aureus pbp <dig>  are strict dd-carboxypeptidases and are unable to catalyze transpeptidation reactions  <cit> . using the synthetic tripeptide nα,nε-diacetyl-lys-d-ala-d-ala and the natural monomer nacglc-nacmur-pentapeptide in an in vitro assay, we showed that lmo <dig> displays weak dd-carboxypeptidase activity, cleaving the peptide bond between the subterminal and terminal d-alanine moieties. however, the recombinant lmo <dig> was active against neither e. coli peptidoglycan nor the natural dimeric muropeptide d <dig> . this suggests that lmo <dig>  like pbp <dig>  <cit> , preferentially degrades low-molecular-weight substrates. analysis of the muropeptide profiles of a l. monocytogenes mutant demonstrated that the lack of lmo <dig> activity does not affect the muropeptide structure of its peptidoglycan. however, the ratio of pentapeptides to tripeptides was found to be increased in cells lacking both lmo <dig> and pbp <dig>  similar changes have been observed in the peptidoglycan from a l. monocytogenes mutant lacking pbp <dig>  <cit> , b. subtilis devoid of pbp <dig>  <cit>  and s. pneumoniae with disrupted pbp <dig> activity  <cit> . these changes in the muropeptide profile indicate that l. monocytogenes pbp <dig>  like pbp <dig> of b. subtilis and pbp <dig> of s. pneumoniae, is a dd-carboxypeptidase that plays a basic role in the maturation of the cell wall peptidoglycan.

mutations in genes coding for low molecular mass pbps are not lethal for the bacterial cell and in general these proteins seem to be redundant. mutants can survive not only the lack of individual lmm pbps, e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , s. pneumoniae  <cit> , s. aureus  <cit>  and myxococcus xanthus  <cit> , but also the loss of all lmm pbps, e.g. e. coli  <cit> , neisseria gonorrhoeae  <cit>  and b. subtilis  <cit> . similarly, we demonstrated that the inactivation of l. monocytogenes genes lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> is not lethal and these gene products are dispensable for the growth and survival of the cells.

the results of the present and previous studies indicate that the growth of l. monocytogenes is only slightly impaired when it lacks the activities of lmo <dig> or both lmo <dig> and pbp <dig>  <cit> . reduced growth rates have also been reported for a s. pneumoniae mutant lacking functional pbp <dig>  <cit>  and for a double n. gonorrhoeae mutant lacking both pbp <dig> and pbp <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, no changes in growth rate were observed for e. coli or b. subtilis mutants lacking most or all of their dd-carboxypeptidase activity  <cit> .

however, the loss of lmo <dig> did result in significant changes in morphology. the mutant cells were significantly longer, slightly curved and had bent ends. these changes were even more pronounced in the double mutant ad <dig> lacking both lmo <dig> and pbp <dig>  this finding is interesting because we did not notice any alterations in cell shape in a l. monocytogenes mutant lacking pbp <dig> alone, although the cell wall of the mutant was much thicker than that of the parental strain  <cit> , even though guinane et al.  <cit>  did describe such changes. the differences between our observations may be due to variation in the strain  or growth conditions employed  <cit> .

the reason for the prominent morphological changes in strain kd <dig> is difficult to pinpoint since there do not seem to be any remarkable changes in the muropeptide structure of the peptidoglycan of this mutant. however, the observed changes in cell morphology implicate the protein in the late stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, presumably in the determination of the availability of pentapeptide substrates. our finding that lmo <dig> preferentially degrades low-molecular-weight substrates may point to the a role for this protein in cell wall turnover. further studies are required to clarify the function of lmo <dig>  although, as in the case of extensive studies on the d-alanine carboxypeptidases of e. coli  <cit>  and other bacteria, they may not yield conclusive results.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study conclusively show that nine of the ten previously identified putative pbp genes of l. monocytogenes code for proteins that bind β-lactam antibiotics and their labeled or fluorescent derivatives. eight of these proteins were identified in whole cell extracts, whereas the ninth protein, lmo <dig>  was only shown to bind β-lactams following expression in e. coli and subsequent purification by affinity chromatography. the inability to detect lmo <dig> activity in the l. monocytogenes cell may be explained by the low abundance of this protein, whose expression is regulated by the two-component system cesrk  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that the lmm pbp lmo <dig> is a dd-carboxypeptidase and has no discernible β-lactamase activity. mutants lacking the protein grow normally, although their cells are often longer and slightly curved. similar morphological changes were observed in the case of a double mutant lacking two lmm carboxypeptidases: lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  our results indicate that lmo <dig> most probably participates in the late stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, in the determination of the availability of pentapeptide substrates. moreover, the fact that lmo <dig> preferentially degrades low-molecular-weight substrates may point to a role in cell wall turnover. the product of the tenth putative pbp gene, lmo <dig>  was not found to bind β-lactams with any of the various methods employed and consequently cannot be considered a pbp. in this respect it resembles the homologous protein vany from vana- and vanb-type enterococcal strains. this study extends the number of identified penicillin-binding proteins from the original five  <cit>  to the final number of nine which represents the full set of these proteins in l. monocytogenes.
