BACKGROUND
t cell migration to sites of inflammation and infection is essential for adaptive immunity and host protection. current methods of analyzing t cell migration and homing primarily rely on obtaining mouse end-organ tissues and subsequent detection of cells within these organs, either through in situ analysis by immunohistologic methods or by isolation and analysis of recovered t cells from disrupted tissues. while each of these approached offers unique advantages , neither permits "real-time" analysis of t cell dynamics following antigenic exposure and is limited to specific time points and tissues chosen for study. bioluminescent imaging represents a powerful alternative for the monitoring immune cell homing and migration in vivo that does not require animal sacrifice for analysis.

luciferase proteins produce light in the visible spectrum  following interaction with luciferin substrate molecules. this reaction only requires atp and oxygen and thus can occur in any actively metabolic cell. luciferin, a small water-soluble molecule, readily crosses cell membranes and can penetrate into virtually all tissues. light produced by the luciferase-luciferin reaction is detectable by low-light detection devices, such as charge-coupled device 4cameras. bioluminescence imaging is a good model for in vivo imaging based on the low background signal, since it only detects chemical reactions between the enzyme and substrate. bioluminescence also requires relatively short imaging times , is easy to use, and the instrumentation is relatively inexpensive  <cit> .

luciferase imaging techniques have previously been used to track localization of bacterial and viral pathogens, monitor therapeutic responses in tumor xenografts, and allograft cell survival  <cit> . recent studies have utilized bioluminescence to track t cell homing patterns following adoptive transfer of luciferase-expressing allogeneic t cells into mhc-mismatched recipient mice  <cit> . we have also reported use of luciferase-expressing cd <dig> t cells for analysis of population dynamics in response to viral-based antigenic-challenge  <cit> . these studies reveal that t cell proliferation, in the context of graft versus host disease or viral infection, can be visualized in 'real-time' within recipient mice. the luciferase-expressing t cells can also be identified within specific tissue sites in order to determine homing and migration kinetics over time  <cit> .

in the current study, we describe the generation of a transgenic mouse  model in which the luciferase gene is specifically expressed by t cells, thereby permitting analysis of t cell population dynamics in living mice in real-time. by crossing the t-lux transgenic mice with ova-specific cd <dig> tcr transgenic mice , we have generated a reporter model with which to track antigen-specific cd <dig> t cells in vivo, in real-time. our studies reveal the population dynamics of the cd <dig> clonal response within draining lymphoid tissues and antigen injection sites in individual mice and demonstrate the utility of this model for non-invasive analyses of t cell clonal responses.

methods
mice
c57bl/ <dig> and c57bl/ <dig> ly <dig>   mice were obtained from jackson laboratory . thy <dig> -expressing c57bl/ <dig> mice were obtained from charles river breeding laboratories. mice used for imaging were placed on a low light diet  to reduce non-specific luminescence. all mice were housed or bred in our specific pathogen-free facility, and were initially used at 6– <dig> weeks of age. all mice were housed and treated according to national institutes of health guidelines under the auspices of the uab institutional animal care and use committee  of the university of alabama at birmingham.

generation of t-lux transgenic mouse
the luciferase coding sequence was excised from the pgl <dig> plasmid  by xba i/nco i digestion, blunted with klenow and ligated into a sma i-linearized hcd <dig> minigene cassette plasmid . the t-lux transgene was restriction mapped for correct orientation and sequenced across the integration joints to confirm the correct reading frame and terminus of the luciferase gene . the reporter gene construct was introduced into single-cell embryos of donor c57bl/ <dig> mice by pronuclear injection in the uab transgenic mouse facility. potential founder lines were screened by luminescence analysis of peripheral blood. red blood cells were lysed from  <dig> μl of blood using ack buffer for  <dig> minutes. cells were then plated into 96-well plates and luciferin  added to each well  <dig> minutes prior to imaging. bioluminescence imaging of the plates was performed using the ivis® imaging system with stage at  <dig> cm height for  <dig> seconds. one founder line  with readily detectable luminescence that transmitted the transgene in the germline was selected for subsequent studies.

antibodies
the following antibodies were used for fluorescence labelling of cells for flow cytometric analyses: fluorescein isothiocyanate -labelled anti-mouse cd <dig> ; phycoerythrin -labelled anti-mouse cd <dig> ; pe-labelled anti-mouse cd <dig>  ; biotin-labelled anti-mouse cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  . all were purchased from ebiosciences . percp-labelled anti-mouse cd <dig>  was purchased from bd pharmingen .

flow cytometric analysis
single cell suspensions from specified target organs were analyzed by facs at the indicated time points. cells were stained for flow cytometry with fitc-, pe-, percp-, or biotin-conjugated mabs indicated in the appropriate figure legends. cells labelled with biotinylated primary ab were detected with allophycocyanin-conjugated streptavidin. for analytical flow cytometry, at least  <dig>  events with forward and side scatter properties of lymphocytes were collected on a facscalibur flow cytometer  and analyzed using cellquest software . some analyses were performed using flowjo software .

isolation and transfer of t-lux cells
splenocytes were harvested from t-lux mice and cd4+ t lymphocytes isolated using dynal bead separation , according to manufacturer's instructions. briefly, t-lux splenocytes were incubated with cd4+ specific magnetic beads for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. the cell-attached beads were then incubated with detach-a-bead at room temperature for  <dig> hour. thoroughly washed cells were counted, resuspended in rpmi medium without serum, and transferred to recipient mice via tail vein injection.

in vivo bioluminescence imaging of mice
mice were anesthetized with isofluorane gas and placed in a light-tight chamber. a photographic  reference image was obtained at  <dig> minutes after d-luciferin injection ; bioluminescent images were collected immediately thereafter. images were obtained with a ccd camera cooled to -120°c, using the ivis®  <dig> imaging system  with the field of view set at  <dig> cm height. the photographic images used a  <dig>  second exposure, 8f/stop,  <dig> binning , and an open filter. the bioluminescent images used exposures ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> seconds, 1f/stop,  <dig> binning and open filter. the bioluminescent and gray-scale images were overlaid using living image software . igor image analyses software  was also used to obtain a pseudocolor image representing bioluminescence intensity . regions of interest were drawn around organs and the total counts  were summed in the entire organ areas. the total counts in each region of interest were normalized to total acquisition time to obtain counts/sec.

RESULTS
transgenic mice containing the firefly luciferase gene, luc, under control of a human cd <dig> mini-gene cassette produce t cell-specific bioluminescence
the human cd <dig>  minigene cassette has previously been utilized to direct transgene expression in mouse t cells  <cit> . the hcd <dig> minigene contains an ~ <dig> kb 5' flanking/promoter region and a  <dig>  kb 3' region that contains a locus control region . the lcr of the hcd <dig> contains a t cell-specific enhancer and additional regulatory elements responsible for establishing an active chromatin domain in t lymphocytes  <cit> . the intact first intron of human cd <dig>  located downstream of the promoter region, improves efficiency of transgene expression. transgene expression levels are typically independent of the integration site, and the level of expression is proportional to the number of transgene copies  <cit> .

firefly luciferase gene, luc, was inserted into the partial second exon of hcd <dig> minigene . the transgene was then injected into the pronuclei of single-cell embryos from c57bl/ <dig> female mice. two rounds of injections resulted in  <dig> mice. red blood cell-depleted peripheral blood was imaged after the addition of luciferin, using the ivis® imaging system. four founder mice that displayed luciferase expression were identified  . one of these founders, t-lux founder # <dig>  transmitted the transgene in the germline and displayed t lineage-specific expression , and was used for all subsequent studies.

the distribution of luciferase-expressing cells was determined in intact founder mice. bioluminescent imaging revealed increased signal within lymphoid tissue regions . as anticipated, bioluminescence was detected from the thymus, as well as spleen, peripheral lymph nodes , and gastrointestinal lymphoid tissues, consistent with normal lymphocyte homing patterns  <cit> . light emission from circulating t cells and skin t cells delineated the anatomical outlines of the mouse.

splenocytes from t-lux transgenic mice were isolated in order to determine the lineage specificity of the luciferase transgene. splenocytes were separated by facs into four populations, cd4+, cd8+, b220+, and a triple-negative population. the facs purity of the sorted populations of cd4+ and cd8+ were 98% and 99%, respectively, while the b220+ and the negative populations were 96% and 90% pure. cells were plated into 96-well plates in equivalent numbers of each population  and were imaged for bioluminescence ex vivo. as shown in figure 1e, bioluminescent signal was almost exclusively within the cd4+ and cd8+ t cell populations. quantification of light emission of these cell populations confirmed the purity of the sort. ratios of cd4:b <dig> and cd4:negative show a 4% and 5% bioluminescent signal, respectively. these numbers are consistent with the low level of t cell contamination of these populations detected by facs analysis. t-lux t cells retained normal t cell proliferation in response to tcr stimulation and produced similar levels of cytokines compared to wild-type t cells . thus, the t-lux transgene produces a detectable bioluminescent signal that is limited to the t cell compartment, and does not alter t cell function in these cells.

t-lux cd3+ t cells rapidly home to secondary lymphoid tissues and produce a stable luciferase signal within  <dig> hours following adoptive transfer
naïve t cells are excluded from non-lymphoid tissues and preferentially home to secondary lymphoid organs  <cit> . expression of cd62l and ccr <dig> allow for recognition and binding to the high endothelial venules within lymphoid tissues  <cit> . t cells typically reside within the lymph nodes for approximately  <dig> hours before re-entering the circulation unless activated by dendritic cells  <cit> . until antigen is encountered, these t cells will migrate randomly between secondary lymphoid tissues  <cit> .

the ability to monitor t cell signal within the live mouse over time provides an opportunity to efficiently analyze t cell distribution kinetics serially in single mice, eliminating the need for use of large cohorts of mice that can be analyzed only at individual time points. to test the homing characteristics of the t-lux t cells following adoptive transfer into immunocompetent mice, we transferred  <dig> ×  <dig> t-lux cd3+ cells into cd <dig> , non-irradiated b <dig> recipients . individual recipient mice were imaged beginning  <dig> minutes post-transfer and at the indicated time intervals . detectable signal was present within the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes as early as  <dig> min following adoptive transfer, consistent with previously published studies  <cit> . a splenic signal was also visible prior to  <dig> hour after transfer in anterior-posterior  image orientations, and was readily detectable  <dig> min post-transfer in left lateral images .

bioluminescent signal  was calculated in order to quantitate the bioluminescent signal intensity change over time, as t cell migratory patterns can be delineated by analyzing the signal flux within different regions of measurement. when the signal flux ceases to change, it can be concluded that pool size homeostasis has been achieved in the anatomical regions of interest. we collected and graphed whole body light emission measurements over time and assessed migratory trends of t-lux t cells. following a brief decrease in signal due to redistribution following injection, whole body bioluminescence increased, reaching a plateau between  <dig> and  <dig> hours . notably, signal intensity in the intestinal lymphoid tissues equilibrated more rapidly , consistent with more rapid recruitment to these tissue sites prior to redistribution, whereas signal intensities in other secondary lymphoid tissues equilibrated by ~ <dig> hours post-transfer . there was no detectable early enrichment in the lung fields, indicating that no significant trapping of transferred t cells in the pulmonary capillary beds was evident.

correlation of bioluminescent signal intensity with t cell distribution in vivo
to determine the relationship between bioluminescent signal and t cell numbers in the t-lux mouse, the per-cell signal intensity was defined under non-attenuating conditions in vitro to provide a baseline for subsequent in vivo studies. in vitro, t-lux spleen and peripheral lymph node t cells were added to a 96-well plate in decreasing cell numbers from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cd3+ cells. bioluminescent signal was quantified for each population . a comparison of signal strength  and t cell numbers demonstrated a linear relationship  , and the per-cell signal intensity was ≈  <dig>  counts/cell/sec.

the signal of t cell bioluminescence within the intact mouse was assessed following adoptive transfer of luciferase-expressing cells. initial studies were designed to analyze whole body bioluminescent signal generated by differing numbers of t-lux t cells. increasing numbers of cd3+ t-lux cells  were injected via tail vein into congenic c57bl/ <dig> recipients. bioluminescent imaging of the entire mouse was performed at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours following transfer. representative images obtained at  <dig> hours are shown in figure 3c. stable bioluminescent signals in the abdominal region, spleen, and cervical lymph node regions were present by  <dig> hours post-transfer . comparison of whole body counts/sec versus t-lux cell dose confirmed a linear and proportional relationship .

subsequent experiments were performed to determine the correlation of t cell number to bioluminescent signal within specific anatomical tissue regions. t cells  were obtained from cd <dig> + t-lux mice and introduced into congenic cd <dig> + c57bl/ <dig> recipients. use of the cd <dig> allelic marker allowed discrimination by facs of the donor cd <dig> -expressing t-lux cells. recipient mice were imaged every three days in defined anatomical regions following t cell redistribution to secondary lymphoid tissues. direct analysis of transgenic t cell numbers in those sites by flow cytometry was then performed and compared to the luciferase bioluminescent signal .

the peripheral lymph node  regions of interest  generated an observable signal following t cell transfer  at all time points . comparison of signal strength to t cell numbers resulted in a  <dig>  counts/cell/sec ratio . cervical lymph nodes produced similar results of  <dig>  counts/cell/sec. by comparison, the signal to cell ratio within the spleen was reduced in ap positioning , consistent with increased attenuation of luciferase signal from t cells resident in the deeper tissues , although on lateral view, this attenuation was not apparent .

signal to cell ratios from mesenteric lymph nodes surprisingly revealed an increased signal to cell ratio  compared to superficial lymph nodes . this is likely due to a contribution of additional signal from other lymphoid tissues within the gut, producing a "generalized" signal. additional experiments were performed on mice after surgically opening the abdomen under anesthesia and exposing intestinal tissue. these "open" images revealed t-lux signal within individual peyer's patches and other regions not clearly seen within the overall abdominal signal . collectively, these experiments demonstrated the ability to quantify t cell numbers in situ in real-time using bioluminescence, and although the signal intensity per cell varied depending on anatomic location, the calculated values proved reliable for estimating t cell number in each site at different time points in the same animal, and even between individual mice that received comparable t cell transfers.

tracking homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic hosts
normal t cells undergo extensive homeostatic proliferation in a lymphopenic setting. expansion of t cells following transfer into an immunodeficient host can be due to both thymic-dependent and -independent mechanisms  <cit> . an essential role for interleukin- <dig> in thymic-independent expansion of t cells has been well described  <cit> . the luciferase-expressing t-lux mouse provided a model to visualize homeostatic t cell expansion over time within the live host.

we transferred  <dig> ×  <dig> t-lux cd3+ cells into c57bl/ <dig> rag-deficient  mice , which lack mature t and b cells. reconstituted rag-/- mice were then imaged for bioluminescent signal at the indicated time points post-transfer. whole body bioluminescent images revealed rapidly increasing signal during the first two weeks following transfer , followed by plateau. comparison studies performed with transfers of  <dig> ×  <dig> t-lux cd3+ cells into wt c57bl/ <dig> mice showed that, in contrast to the luciferase signal in the lymphopenic rag-/- mice, immunocompetent mice showed a modest decline in luciferase signal after two days, followed by a relatively stable signal over the ensuing three weeks . in the rag-deficient recipients, the t cell signal was evident in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, consistent with some degree of memory t cell development and distribution. whole body bioluminescence signal from reconstituted rag-/- mice was approximately 20% of the intact, wild-type t-lux mouse. this finding correlated with the relative total t cell numbers when organs were harvested and transferred cells counted .

non-invasive tracking of t cell half-life
diversity of the t cell receptor repertoire is essential for protection of the host from infection. previous studies have demonstrated that the number of cells bearing the same mhcii:peptide-specific tcr within the naïve cd4+ t cell repertoire is in the range of 20– <dig>  <cit> . this same group also demonstrated that survival of cd4+ t cells in vivo is determined in part by tcr specificity attributes, but also clonal frequency, with an inverse relationship between t cell number and half-life. the half-life of adoptively transferred polyclonal cd4+ t cells within secondary lymphoid tissues was calculated to be  <dig> days  <cit> .

whole body bioluminescent imaging using t-lux t cells provided a non-invasive method of measuring the half-life of t cells within the entire mouse. adoptive transfer studies were performed by infusing  <dig>  ×  <dig> polyclonal naïve t-lux cd3+ cells  into cd <dig> -positive, b <dig> mice. bioluminescent imaging was performed on recipient mice every other day, beginning  <dig> day post-transfer and for a total of  <dig> days, and in some studies extended for a total of  <dig> days. as seen in figure 6a, there was a progressive decline in bioluminescent signal from individual mice following transfers. in extended experiments, the t cell half-life calculated on the basis of decay in luminescent signal yielded a calculated half-life of ~ <dig> days, in good agreement with published data  <cit> . further, the decline in signal did not appear to be due to active immune clearance, as parallel studies using non-transgenic, cd <dig> -positive, cd3+ t cells transferred into cd <dig>  b <dig> recipients demonstrated a comparable decline in t cell numbers as determined by facs analysis of lymphoid tissues .

we next determined whether there was stability of single-cell luciferase signal by t-lux cells following adoptive transfers. after transfer of  <dig>  ×  <dig> t-lux cd3+ cells, we imaged distinct regions of interest  for peripheral, cervical, and mesenteric lymph nodes. spleen was not included in this analysis due to the attenuation of signal previously demonstrated in ap determinations. we obtained bioluminescent signal measurements from all rois every  <dig> days for  <dig> weeks. we then quantified t cell numbers from each region using flow cytometric analyses at the indicated time points post-transfer based on the cd <dig>  marker, and calculated the counts per cell produced within these lymphoid organs . the ratio of counts/cell remained constant despite the decline in overall transferred cell numbers, indicating that signal loss was due to decline in the number, not single-cell intensity, of luciferase-expressing cells. thus, the luciferase reporter appears to be stable for prolonged periods following adoptive transfer and shows no evidence of provoking an alloantigenic response, at least in the c57bl/ <dig> strain background.

whole body imaging of clonal cd4+ t cell response to antigen
after encountering antigen, cd4+ t cells undergo marked clonal expansion followed by a contraction phase on clearance of antigen  <cit> . the t-lux mouse represents a novel model for the analysis of t cell dynamics following antigen encounter. to study the cd4+ t cell antigen-specific response in individual mice, we crossed the t-lux mouse with the ot-ii tcr transgenic mouse  <cit> , and transferred t-lux-ot-ii t cells into immunocompetent congenic recipients. ova peptide emulsified in a non-toxic, multiple emulsion adjuvant   <cit> , or adjuvant alone, was injected into the footpad of recipient mice and the clonal cd4+ t cell response imaged over time .

quantification of the bioluminescent signal was performed for the draining lymph nodes , non-draining  lns, dorsal injected footpad, as well as whole body and other regions of interest. strict gating on the injection site  was performed to isolate injection site signal from the draining popliteal node signal . bioluminescent signal was analyzed over time for each of these sites . increased t cell signal was first demonstrated in the draining lymph node at day  <dig> . this signal was greater in the group given  <dig> μg ova compared to  <dig> μg . increased signal in the draining lymph node preceded t cell migration to the injection site by 1– <dig> days, with increasing signal at the injection site apparent on day  <dig>  this pattern is consistent with previous studies demonstrating t cell expansion within the draining lymph node followed by migration and accumulation within non-lymphoid tissue sites  <cit> . t cell bioluminescent signal in both these regions, as well as whole body, peaked at day  <dig> and showed similar patterns of decreasing signal by day 10– <dig>  although residual signal was evident in the injection site for several days after attenuation of signal in the draining ln. t cell signal was higher in whole body, draining lymph node, and footpad regions in those mice given  <dig> μg compared to  <dig> μg ova injections . the non-draining lymph node showed minimal increase in signal , but notably, other distal lns demonstrated significant signal increase at the peak of the response . t cell migration to non-lymphoid tissues was largely restricted to the injection site, with minimal apparent trafficking to other tissue sites . notably, the t cell signal was substantially higher in the injection site than in the draining lns at the respective peaks of signal intensity, suggesting that t cells activated in the draining lns rapidly trafficked to the site of antigen/adjuvant injection and accumulated there before declining in number. given that the large majority of the total body signal was accounted for in the draining lns and injection site, the rapid decrement in signal after day  <dig> indicates cell loss, rather than redistribution to other tissue sites. thus, following the contraction phase, t cell bioluminescent signal diminished to levels comparable to that of the pre-injection levels  and those of sham  injected mice.

discussion
t cells undergo a complex pattern of clonal proliferation and expansion following primary and secondary antigenic challenges  <cit> . using luciferase-expressing ot-ii t cells, we were able to monitor antigen-specific cd4+ t cell dynamics serially in the same animal. in accord with previous reports, our results demonstrated initial expansion within the draining lymph node followed rapidly by migration and accumulation within a footpad injection site  <cit> . notably, and in agreement with a previous study  <cit> , we find that overwhelmingly the t cells that leave the lymph node draining the site of antigen injection migrate to the antigen injection site, although some enhanced accumulation of cells in other secondary lymphoid tissues is evident. despite early increases in t cells numbers in the draining lymph nodes, t cell numbers within both the draining lymph node and the injection site demonstrated a peak  <dig> days after injection, followed by a rapid decline in signal intensity both in the draining lymph nodes and injection site that was only marginally delayed kinetically in the latter. the concordance of the peak of t cell expansion in the draining lymph node and injection site in our study is somewhat different from previous studies, which demonstrated a more prolonged time course  <cit>  and kinetic delay between peak t cell numbers in draining lymph node and injection site. this likely reflects the more rapid clearance of the antigen-adjuvant depot in our study, as the me adjuvant is far less viscous and is more rapidly cleared from tissue sites than the oil-based emulsions used in previous studies . this highlights the importance of sustained antigen in the injection site to prolong recruitment and/or survival of immigrating t cells attracted to the site of antigen delivery  <cit> .

in the current study, there was no detectable redistribution of cd <dig> t cell signal to non-lymphoid tissues following clonal contraction in the draining lns and injection site, which is in contrast to previous studies wherein antigen and adjuvant were delivered systemically, or in studies of the cd <dig> response to viral infection. again, this likely reflects differences in the distribution and kinetics of antigen clearance in the different studies. this may also reflect characteristics of the ot-ii tcr transgenic model, clonotypic t cells from which have a relatively low avidity for the mhc-ovap complex that may allow endogenous clones reactive to ova peptide to out-compete the ot-ii response over time. future studies, following crosses of the t-lux reporter transgene with other tcr transgenic specificities should help address this. in any case, given the relative technical ease with which t cell clonal dynamics can be monitored using the t-lux model, efforts to implement these types of single animal longitudinal studies represents a significant advance for conducting studies of adjuvant type and delivery for future studies, with attendant advantages for optimizing future vaccine therapies for infectious agents and cancer.

homeostatic proliferation of mature t cells occurs within the lymphopenic host and has been shown to be associated with a concomitant shift toward memory phenotypes . t cell expansion in this setting has been shown to be due to il- <dig>  <cit>  and il-15/il-2-dependent mechanisms  <cit> . il- <dig>  in particular, has been demonstrated to induce a memory phenotype in cd8+ t cells that is associated with an alteration of cell homing receptors  <cit> . it is not surprising; therefore, that we observed t cell expansion and localization of t-lux cells within non-lymphoid tissues following transfer into the rag-deficient mice. localization within non-lymphoid tissues as well as the activation profile of these cells has important implications in immune reconstitution following infection and bone marrow transplantation, and implementation of the t-lux model for efficient characterization of this process is demonstrated herein.

bioluminescent imaging technology provides a mechanism to observe t cell homing and specific cd4+ t cell immune responses in vivo, in real-time in individual animals. this technique eliminates the need for large groups of mice terminated at varying time points, reducing animal usage and cost. in addition, this provides a method to efficiently observe and quantitate t cell responses in all tissue sites simultaneously, providing a window on t cell response dynamics not easily achieved using approaches that require tissue disruption for localization and quantitation of t cells. also, given the lack of alloreactivity of the luciferase reporter molecule in the c57bl/ <dig> strain, the t-lux mouse provides an excellent method for long-term immune studies following adoptive transfer. we have monitored t-lux t cell survival up to  <dig> days following adoptive transfer and found no evidence of immune clearance in re-transfer studies . previous studies in rats have demonstrated the absence of immunogenicity of firefly luciferase using transgenic tissue allografts  <cit> . in contrast, studies using green fluorescence protein , another bioluminescent tracking molecule, have demonstrated an immune response to the molecule and decreased lifespan for gfp-expressing cells  <cit> . thus, the t-lux mouse is ideal for model systems investigating long-term immune recognition, such as mouse bone marrow transplant models. other groups have utilized luciferase expression for analysis of lymphocyte homing following adoptive transfer  <cit> . these authors have utilized bioluminescence to perform elegant studies on the role of regulatory t cells in graft versus host disease  <cit> . we feel that our t-lux model improves on previous luciferase models through the generation of t-cell-specific bioluminescence. limiting luciferase expressing to the t cell compartment enables the specific study of t cell dynamics within the intact mouse and eliminates potential confounding factors, such as an alteration of the normal tcr clonal precursor frequency that can affect t cell dynamics in adoptive transfer studies  <cit> .

a current limitation of the t-lux model is the attenuation of bioluminescent signal from t cells in deeper tissues. this is due to light absorption by superficial tissues situated between the t cell source and the detector when imaging cells within deeper organs. decreased or attenuated luciferase signal is particularly apparent in the case of interference within blood rich organs, such as spleen, as hemoglobin absorbs light in the wavelength emitted by the luciferase enzyme  <cit> . however, this limitation only affects absolute quantitation of t cells within deep tissues, while relative quantitation and dynamic changes over time are unaffected, as demonstrated herein. further, the orientation of the animal can offset much of this limitation, depending on the tissue of interest . finally, recent advances in the development of tomographic luminescent imaging instruments that can generate 3d images promise to enhance both sensitivity and spatial resolution of the t cell signal using this model, and should permit finer mapping of the real-time dynamics of t cell distribution to all tissue sites in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized a novel transgenic mouse model that utilizes t-cell specific luciferase bioluminescence for tracking t cell homing and migration dynamics in vivo. to our knowledge, this represents the first report of real-time, in vivo analysis of cd4+ t cell homeostatic proliferation and clonal response to antigen. although our results are largely confirmatory of prior studies that have examined t cell responses through direct tissue-based analyses of t cell numbers and distribution, implementation of the t-lux model has provided some important new insights, and highlights certain advantages of this approach for tracking the in vivo t cell response.
