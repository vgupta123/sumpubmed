BACKGROUND
antimicrobial and antimycotic peptides are small cationic and amphipathic molecules, generally with fewer than  <dig> amino acids. these ubiquitous peptides have been isolated from prokaryotes and eukaryotes in the plant, bacterial, fungal, and animal kingdoms  <cit> . nature has strategically placed antimicrobial and antifungal peptides as a first line of defence between the host organism and its surrounding environment, because these peptides are able to inhibit quickly a wide spectrum of infectious microbes without significant toxicity to the host organism. when insects are infected within a short period they secrete an array of cationic peptides to combat the invading organism  <cit> . although antimicrobial peptides  are the primary means of combating organisms in lower forms of life, these peptides have an adjunct role in the immune system of phylogenetically more advanced organisms.

there is a large array of antifungal proteins with different structures. in addition to the well-known glucanases  <cit> , chitinases  <cit> , thaumatin-like proteins  <cit> , defensins  <cit>  and ribosome-inactivating proteins  <cit> , there is a diversity of other antifungal proteins such as lipid transfer proteins  <cit>  and protease inhibitors  <cit> .

both fungi and humans are eukaryotes and at the molecular level, their cells are similar. this makes it more difficult to find or design drugs that target fungi without affecting human cells. consequently many antifungal drugs cause side effects. some of these side effects can be life threatening if the drugs are not used properly. despite chemical therapies, serious fungal infections remain difficult to treat, and resistance to the available drugs is emerging  <cit> . antifungals work by exploiting differences between mammalian and fungal cells to kill the fungal organism without dangerous effects on the host. a common theme with most of these wide-spectrum amps is that they lyse the cell membranes of the pathogens without harming the host targets. despite this non-specific mechanism, many of these peptides do not lyse mammalian membranes at concentrations that can inhibit the pathogen  <cit> .

in the last decades, the incidence of fungal infections by pathogenic c. albicans and other related human opportunistic yeast species has increased dramatically due to the rise in the number of immunocompromised patients. several candida species especially c. albicans normally inhabit the oral cavity, respiratory and intestinal tracts, and vaginal cavity of humans and animals. in recent years, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of treatment failures in candidiasis patients receiving long-term antifungal therapy, which has posed a serious problem in its successful use in chemotherapy. candida cells acquire multidrug resistance  during the course of the treatment  <cit> .

many bacterial strains, and particularly their enzymes, that perform catalysis efficiently at low temperatures are used in a number of biotechnology applications  <cit> . enterococci, as part of the natural intestinal flora of humans and animals, are known to play an important role in maintaining microbial balance  <cit> . many different enterocins have been described from enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. some of these peptides showed activity against escherichia coli <cit>  and salmonella pullorum <cit> .

since the literature on bacterial antifungal proteins is rather scanty compared with that on bacterial bacteriocins, there is a pressing need to explore and isolate from new sources potential bacteria capable of producing novel amps and to characterise them for further applications. in the present study, we report the purification and characterisation of an antifungal protein produced by e. faecalis, that shows broad-spectrum activity against the indicator organisms, multidrug resistant c. albicans with negligible haemolytic activity.

RESULTS
characterization of species
the promising anti-mycotic strain in the present study was determined to be gram-positive cocci, acid producing, non-motile, catalase and oxidase negative. the strain showed good growth at  <dig> %  nacl at  <dig> and 37°c. in addition it was esculin hydrolysis-positive as it fermented mannose which is the characteristic of the genus enterococcus. the producer of the anti-mycotic principle was identified as enterococcus faecalis based on its physiological and biochemical characteristic. based on the 16s rdna gene sequence, the strain was identified as e. faecium <cit> . further, using the primers em1a and em1b  <cit> , an amplicon of approximately  <dig> base pairs was observed on  <dig> %  agarose gel confirming the strain to be e. faecium. however, this strain reduced potassium tellurite and produced black colour colonies, indicating the species e. faecalis.

the two wild type isolates  of the pathogenic indicator organism were identified as c. albicans based on 18s ribotyping. the sequences of the di and wi isolates showed closest homology  to the sequences of c. albicans m <dig> ysasrsua and aj <dig>  respectively.

determination of inhibitory spectrum
the susceptibilities of various multidrug resistant c. albicans strains to growth inhibition by the supernatant as well as dialysed concentrate of e. faecalis are presented in table  <dig>  the supernatant and dialysed concentrate also showed inhibitory activity against one wild type c. albicans strain  isolated from a diabetic patient from goa. amongst these strains, maximum activity was observed against c. albicans strains mtcc  <dig>  mtcc  <dig>  mtcc  <dig>  and ncim  <dig> and minimum activity was observed against wild type c. albicans   and c.krusei . the biological activity of acp at different dilutions is shown in figure  <dig>  against mtcc  <dig> 

antimicrobial activity of cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts
the antimicrobial activity of the cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of e. faecalis was determined using a cut-well agar assay on mgyp and bhi plates. no zone of inhibition was produced against c. albicans mtcc  <dig>  pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc  <dig> and staphylococcus aureus mtcc  <dig> by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts, establishing that the inhibition was mainly due to extracellular substances.

kinetics of antifungal protein production
biomass and antimycotic protein production by e. faecalis in modified trypticase soya  broth, was analysed at the incubation temperature of 14°c . this strain reached the stationary phase after  <dig> h. prolonged incubation up to  <dig> h promoted degradation of the acp but no lysis of biomass. no acp was produced within  <dig> h at 14°c, but it was produced during the active growth phase, and its concentration reached a maximum at  <dig> h, at the middle of the maximum stationary phase. the highest activity  against c. albicans  was recorded between 44– <dig> h of incubation and decreased thereafter. the ph dropped rapidly during the exponential phase, probably because of the strong production of acid associated with growth.

effects of heat, ph, and hydrolytic enzymes
the activity of the cell-free supernatant  was stable upon treatment at different temperatures, for up to 90°c for  <dig> min, but the activity was lost completely after boiling and autoclaving . the antimycotic property of the cfs also remained unaffected at the ph range of  <dig> – <dig> . however, at ph values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  the activity was reduced by 50%, whereas at ph values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  the activity was completely lost. the acp was sensitive to different proteolytic enzymes  confirming its proteinaceous nature whereas it was resistant to pepsin, α-amylase, lipase, lysozyme and trypsin at the concentration of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> .

effects of surfactants, organic solvents and storage
the antimycotic peptide acp remained fully active when treated with different surfactants and organic solvents as mentioned in ‘methods’. the activity was enhanced by  <dig> % in the presence of sds  . long-term storage  at −80°c did not affect the antimicrobial activity , but a slight reduction  in activity at 4°c and −20°c was found.

purification of the anti-candida compound
the highest antifungal activity against different c. albicans strains was present mainly in the fraction precipitated with 85% ammonium sulfate . fractions precipitated with 30% and 50% ammonium sulfate exhibited weak inhibition. the supernatant obtained after 85% ammonium sulfate precipitation clearly did not exhibit any antifungal activity. the antifungal substance present in the 85% cut-off also inhibited germ tube formation in c albicans ncim  <dig> . as is clear from table  <dig>  ammonium sulfate precipitation resulted in an approximate 2-fold increase in specific activity. after ion- exchange chromatography using deae sepharose, the adjacent fractions 31– <dig> in the chromatogram, showed biological activity , and the specific activity increased 17-fold. after gel filtration, the recovery was approximately 22-fold. based on the purification steps summarised in table  <dig>  it was concluded that the total active antimycotic protein recovered was  <dig> % only.

direct detection of activity on page
after gel filtration, partially purified active pooled fractions , were loaded onto tricine gel containing 10% resolving and  <dig> % stacking gel. a clear zone of inhibition on the c. albicans mtcc  <dig> overlaid gel was shown in a petri dish , wherein a simultaneously silver stained gel showed a corresponding band that was responsible for the biological activity. based on the polypeptide molecular weight marker, the molecular mass of the active peptide was estimated to be approximately  <dig> kda . we did not observe any biological activity of the bands using glycine native page.

amino acid sequencing
the first  <dig> amino acid residues of the n-terminal were determined by edman degradation. the minor sequence obtained from the twice repeated n-terminal sequencing was gpggpg, and the same partial sequence was matched for homology. complete homology was not found in the ncbi blast result. however, the gpgg sequence matched a known abc transporter, i.e. abc transporter peptide permease and hypothetical protein. the first three amino acid residue gpg matched with n-terminal sequence of enterocin 1071b  <cit> . likewise the gpg sequence was also observed in entc <dig>  <cit> . analysis of the major n-terminal sequence devytvksgls revealed the presence of s’ suggesting a modified serine which is a feature of class i lantibiotics. this sequence was almost similar to those found in autolysin and hypothetical protein of e. faecalis.

amino acid composition and sequence analysis done by de novo sequencing
based on the de novo sequence the combined peptides having  <dig> amino acid residues were assembled. individual peptides having m/z  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found. the combined peptide did not contain any charged acidic residues . hydrophobic amino acids constituted . the peptides did not significantly match any known proteins present in the mascot and blastp databases. the amino acid sequence of acp  obtained from peptide fragments after digestion of the antimycotic protein with trypsin was analyzed by ms/ms spectra using peaks studio version  <dig>  sp <dig>  with subsequent de-novo sequencing. the peaks obtained are indicated in the sequence below, and overlapping residues are shown in bold. the de novo spectra for peptides are given in figure 5a, b, and c.

unfiltered blast searches using the de novo sequences did not identify any sequence with homology in the protein data bank . only a small patch of sequence matched; for example, a wl motif that was found  <dig> times in enterocin 1071b amino acid sequence  <cit> , and was found  <dig> times in wlppagllgrcgrwfrpwllwlqs gaqykwlgnlfglpgk in the combined de novo sequence  of acp. earlier study on ponericin w <dig> and w <dig> revealed wl and gl motifs and the presence of hydrophobic residues.

mic of the dialysed concentrate containing acp
the highest minimal inhibitory concentration ,  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of dialysed concentrate containing acp was found against wild type c. albicans  whereas the lowest mic,  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was found against mtcc  <dig> and mtcc  <dig> the mic of acp against mtcc  <dig> was  <dig> μg ml- <dig> .

haemolytic and haemagglutination activity assays
freshly grown e. faecalis, streaked on sheep blood agar plates, did not produce a clear haemolytic zone whereas a clear transparent zone was produced by streptococcus pyogenes and s. aureus used as controls. the cytotoxic effect of the extracellular proteins of e. faecalis against human rbcs was determined by haemolytic and haemagglutination assays. the effect of various concentrations of the purified anti-candida compound on human erythrocytes is reported in figure  <dig>  the acp showed negligible haemolytic activity up to the concentration of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> whereas a very weak haemolytic activity of  <dig> % at the concentration of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> of anti-candida protein was found.

no haemagglutination activity of acp was found up to <dig>  mg ml-1; however, a slight haemagglutination activity was observed at  <dig>  mgml- <dig> concentration .

discussion
 biochemical characteristics and fatty acid methyl ester  analysis identified the strain as e. feacalis, whereas  <dig> s rdna sequencing identified the strain as e. faecium <cit> . potassium tellurite reduction, however, distinguished the strain as e. faecalis rather than e. faecium. the concentrate made from the cfs of the test strain inhibited  <dig> multidrug resistant strains of c. albicans.

 there are several bacteriocins from e. faecalis and other species origin  <cit> , but antimycotic peptides or proteins are rare. pseudomonas syringie and some bacillus species produce antifungal peptides, but no such reports about e. faecalis <cit>  were found. the genus enterococcus belongs to a group of important lactic acid bacteria  that participate and contribute towards different fermentation processes. their functionality in dairy and meat products has been reported in detail  <cit> . several bacteriocins produced by enterococcus species  <cit>  or other enterococci of different origins  <cit> , have been reported and characterized at the biochemical and genetic levels. several antifungal peptides  were discovered from bacillus and pseudomonas. nikkomycins, produced by streptomyces tendae and s. ansochromogenes, and polyoxins, produced by s. cacaoi, are the most widely studied antifungal peptides, whereas antifungal peptides from enterococcus species  <cit>  are rare. various strains of bacillus subtilis produce iturin a and bacillomycin l peptide. iturins inhibited the growth of fungi including aspergillus niger, c. albicans, and f. oxysporum <cit> . initial clinical trials involving humans and animals showed that iturin a was effective against dermatomycoses and had a wide spectrum of antifungal properties and low allergenic effects  <cit> . unfortunately, bacillomycin l and iturin a are haemolytic, which may reduce their potential use as antifungal drugs  <cit> .

 in an era of increased incidence of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients  <cit>  and greater resistance to ‘frontline’ antifungal therapies  <cit> , there is a growing need to discover new antifungal therapies. although newer azole derivatives such as voriconazole are more effective and have cidal activity against filamentous fungi such aspergillus fumigatus <cit> , these derivatives are fungistatic and not fungicidal against pathogenic yeasts. the inability to kill yeasts leads to resistance to azole in prolonged infections and increases the likelihood that these agents will lack efficacy in severe candida infections in immunosuppressed patients. amphotericin b has also been commonly used to treat serious fungal infections, but in contrast to azoles, amphotericin b is fungicidal against yeasts. nevertheless, resistance to amphotericin b is slowly developing in selected candida species  <cit>  and there are significant side effects associated with its use, including nephrotoxicity. although recently developed antifungal agents, including the peptide-based agents’ micafungin and caspofungin, are very promising, resistance to these therapies has already been reported  <cit>  and will no doubt become more widespread. the development of resistance to current antifungal agents, the limited efficacy, and the side effects associated with several of these agents increase the importance of continued development of new alternative approaches.

the identified enterococcus faecalis strain produces the antimycotic substance, acp, extracellularly. the activity of the acp was stable upon treatment at different temperatures, for up to 90°c for  <dig> min but the activity was lost after boiling and autoclaving. while similar results have been reported for bacillomycin d from b. subtilis <cit>  and durancin l28-1a from e. durans <cit> , bacteriocin st <dig> from e. faecium was inactivated when subjected to 121°c for  <dig> min  <cit> . the antimycotic property of the acp also remained unaffected in the ph range of  <dig> – <dig> . at ph values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , however, the activity was reduced by 50% whereas at values of ph  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  activity was lost completely. these results are similar to those reported for the bacteriocin produced by e. mundtii <cit> . several bacteriocins produced by enterococci are known to exhibit a wide range of ph stability  <cit> . the acp was stable in different organic solvents and surfactants; such stability has been a common feature of many bacteriocins produced by enterococcus, amp produced by bacillus species, and other lab  <cit> .

 the acp was fully sensitive to proteinase k and partially sensitive to pronase e, confirming its proteinaceous nature. its resistance to pepsin, lysozyme and trypsin indicated that the anti-candida active principle may be a cyclic peptide containing unusual amino acids and therefore more resistant to protease hydrolysis  <cit> . these results suggested that this antimycotic peptide could survive in the intestinal environment and might therefore be administered with food  <cit> . on the other hand, the ineffectiveness of α-amylase and lipase on antimycotic activity suggested that the acp might not be glycosylated and might not contain a lipid moiety. when the acp was heated with  <dig> mmol and  <dig> mmol β-mercaptoethaol at 80°c for  <dig> min to ensure thiol residues existed in the reduced state, no particular change in antimycotic activity was observed. this indicates that the oxidation state of the cysteine residues may not be important for the antimycotic activity  <cit> . when the dialysed acp was treated with the reducing agent dtt, no decrease in inhibitory activity was observed, indicating that disulphide bonds are not responsible for biological activity. it was also observed that storage of acp at −80°c for  <dig> year did not significantly affect biological activity. ammonium sulfate salt as well as sodium phosphate buffer did not inhibit acp activity at the concentration used and did not modify the result of the assay. the dialysed concentrate of acp, dissolved in  <dig> mmol sodium phosphate buffer, weakly bound with the deae sepharose matrix, indicating that the acp bears negative charges. being weakly negative, it was separated easily in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. after purification by ammonium sulfate fractionation, dialysis, anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration, the final amount of recovered protein  was found very low. this could be increased by using protein engineering and optimization methods.

comparing the partial amino acid sequence of the purified antimycotic protein to other antimicrobial peptides and bacteriocins by using protein-protein blast in ncbi revealed no complete homology with other known bacteriocins or amps. the combined n-terminal and de novo sequence gpggpg…wlppagllgrcgrwfrpwllwlqsgaqykwlgnlfglgpk had high amounts of glycine, proline, leucine and tryptophan. this has been observed in many antimicrobial peptides including bacteriocins like enterocin and acidocin.

 it was reported earlier that the glycine-rich antifungal peptide tenacin- <dig> enters the c. albicans cytoplasm  <cit> , although tenacin- <dig> seems not to induce membrane permeabilisation. linear peptides with an extended structure were characterised by an unusual proportion of one or more amino acids   <cit> . penaedins characterised from shrimps and prawns had a high content of pro/arg/gly residues in the extended n-terminal domain  <cit> . oxypinin  <dig> has a gvg motif, and ponericin g has glycine residues flanking the central proline, resulting in a gpg motif with calculated grand average of hydropathicity  of − <dig> . <dig>  the presence of gly-pro hinges in antimicrobial peptides like oxypinins, ponericins, and cecropins supports the antimicrobial potential of acp, wherein a similar sequence was observed. the regional flexibility provided by proline was sometimes enhanced by the presence of glycine residues  <cit> . in another recent report, a penaedin homologue, hyastatin from spider crab  <cit> , was shown to possess a pro/gly domain similar to the n-terminal domain of penaedins that bind chitin tightly. this information strengthens the idea that the n-terminal minor sequence gpggpg of the anti-candida protein in the present study could interact with the cell wall of candida as a primer for antimicrobial action  <cit> . in such a proline-rich sequence, a proline kink has all the potential to create pores  <cit> . it was cogently argued that in cationic hydrophobic peptides the presence of polar residues confers a hydrophilic property to the proline-rich peptides. in an earlier study conducted on curvaticin fs <dig>  the neutral  and hydrophobic  residues at the n-terminal constitute a significant proportion which helps to explain the hydrophobic interactions that curvaticin fs <dig> displays. it was reasoned that the high proportion of gly residues  would likely provide a significant amount of flexibility to the antimicrobial molecule  <cit> . in fact, the increase of hydrophobicity of the peptides also correlated with fungicidal activity  <cit> . in accordance with many other bacteriocins of lab e.g., lactococcin a  <cit> , lactacin f  <cit> , and curvaticin fs <dig>  <cit> , a high proportion of glycine was likely to provide a significant amount of flexibility to the molecule. a recent study on lactococcin g, enterocin 1071b, and entc <dig> suggested that the n-terminal sequence of the peptide of each bacteriocin  is important for determining target cell specificity  <cit> .

previously, the n- terminal sequence of the antimicrobial dermaseptin b was reported to be highly hydrophobic which could enable its binding to zwitterionic outer and negatively charged surfaces  <cit> . in addition, the part of the n-terminal sequence which contains gly-pro residues and the combined de novo sequence detected in the anti-candida protein acp  <dig> under current investigation, were supported by the inference that proline-rich peptides  enter cells without membrane lysis and after entering the cytoplasm bind to and inhibit the activity of specific molecular targets causing cell death  <cit> . other studies with model amphipathic all l- amino acid peptides with the sequence kx3kwx2kx2k, where x = gly, ala, val, or leu showed that the leucine-rich peptide, rather than the ile- or val-containing peptide, was particularly antimicrobial  <cit> . our result is in agreement with this observation: leucine amounted to  <dig> %, and proline  was in association with arginine.

the combined sequence derived from the de novo sequencing, wlppagllgrcgrwfrpwllwlq sgaqy kwlgnlfglgpk, showed high content of glycine , proline, leucine and tryptophan. the amino acid content also revealed that the peptide was quite hydrophobic due to the presence of high amounts of leucine , and this is believed to play a role in the interactions with the cell membrane  <cit> . the hydrophobicities  of individual peptides having m/z  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were  <dig> , - <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which indicates that these peptides are relatively hydrophobic and characteristic of many bacteriocins isolated from enterococcus species  <cit> . high levels of glycine  and glutamine  residues in another cationic antifungal peptide constitutively produced by s. peregrine larva were also reported to bind c. albicans through electrostatic interaction and disturb the osmotic integrity of treated cells  <cit> . in contrast, a novel glycine/leucine-rich antimicrobial peptide, leptoglycine  derived from leptodactylus pentadactylus failed to inhibit c. albicans. we have used the combined de novo sequence to predict the structure using the psipred  server. the sequence wfrpwllwlqsgaqyk showed alpha helical structure, which is characteristic of many antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

the mic of the acp against wild-type c. albicans di was  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  whereas the lowest mic,  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  recorded was against mtcc  <dig> and mtcc  <dig> the mic of the acp against mtcc  <dig> was  <dig> μg ml- <dig> which was slightly higher than the mics of iturin and bafilomycin f  <cit> . in this study, the results of toxicity experiments were of great interest. acp was non-toxic to human erythrocytes up to a tested concentration of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig>  at this concentration, the percent haemolytic activity was  <dig>  which is comparatively much less than the haemolytic activities of baciamin  <cit>  and bafilomycin f  <cit> .

it was also concluded that acp was not able to hemagglutinate human red blood cells up to the concentration of  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> , however the concentration higher than this were able to hemagglutinate the human rbc, whereas this concentration is much more than the mic of the acp. these properties taken together might render this antimycotic protein acp, a potent candidate for treating candidiasis, and its related pharmaceutical application can be established in synergy with other relevant antifungal antibiotics of low dosage.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study an antimycotic protein, acp from the bacterial strain e. faecalis was purified to near homogeneity. this antimycotic peptide has negligible haemagglutination and haemolytic activity and hence potentially warrants use in synergy with low dosages of available antifungal drugs to inhibit multidrug resistant c. albicans.
