BACKGROUND
ageing is due to the gradual accumulation of unrepaired random molecular faults, which leads to an increased fraction of damaged cells and eventually to the functional impairment of older tissues and organs . cellular components are continuously renewed by the processes of catabolism and resynthesis as they wear out or become damaged. however the mechanisms of renewal are not perfectly efficient and over time there may be an increase in damaged molecular structures. for example, there is an accumulation of incompletely degraded intralysosomal waste material, known as lipofuscin, in postmitotic cells  <cit> . in  <dig>  terman proposed the "garbage catastrophe theory" of ageing  <cit>  which states that the process of ageing may derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged, relatively indigestible material, the accumulation of which further hinders cellular catabolic and anabolic functions. terman points out that this theory applies mainly to postmitotic cells and not to proliferating cells. this is supported by the evidence that tissues composed of postmitotic cells such as the heart and brain show the most pronounced age-related changes  <cit> , whereas tissues with constantly proliferating cell populations such as the intestinal epithelium show only minor changes with age  <cit> . a possible reason for this difference is that during cell growth and division, most cellular structures are renewed and there is a dilution of any undigested material.

terman mainly applied his theory to the lysosomal pathway of degradation. he suggested that lysosomes gradually accumulate lipofuscin and that the lipofuscin granules attract lysosomal enzymes which, however, fail to degrade the pigment. this leads to a shortage in lysosomal enzymes, resulting in a decrease in degradation by this pathway. however, the major pathway for the rapid degradation of proteins is the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. proteins need to be degraded either because they are short-lived e.g. key regulatory proteins or because they have become damaged and partially unfolded. partially unfolded proteins have exposed hydrophobic surfaces and are liable to form aggregates. molecular chaperones bind to the exposed surfaces and an attempt is made to refold the protein. if refolding is unsuccessful then chaperones assist in the removal of these proteins and so prevent their aggregation  <cit> .

interestingly, proteasomes themselves are degraded by the lysosomal system and there is evidence for cross-talk between the two degradation pathways  <cit> . it has been observed that there is a progressive decline in the overall proteolytic capacity of the cell with age  <cit>  resulting in an accumulation of oxidized and cross-linked proteins  <cit> . these observations have been linked to an increase in free radicals with age  <cit> . however, there is also evidence that free radicals do not increase with age  <cit> , suggesting that the observed increase in damaged proteins may be a result of a decline in removal of damage rather than an increase in the rate of damage itself. proteins that have been damaged by free radicals appear resistant to proteolytic degradation and can act as inhibitors of lysosomal hydrolases and proteasome activity  <cit> . the small aggregates which precede the formation of mature amyloid fibres are particularly pathogenic in many amyloid diseases  <cit> . sitte et al <cit>  found a dramatic decline of proteasome activity, but not of proteasome enzyme levels in nondividing human bj fibroblasts during hyperoxic ageing. such a decline is not a cell culture artefact because it has been observed in many tissues including cardiac and skeletal muscle, skin, lens and brain . sitte et al <cit>  did not observe a decrease in lysosomal activity with time in nondividing bj fibroblasts. however, both proteasome and lysosomal activity decreased in proliferating bj fibroblasts  <cit> .

it has been reported that aggregated protein directly impairs the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . another set of data indicates that aggregation occurs when the capacity of the proteasome degradation pathway is exceeded but no distinction could be drawn between the possibility of increased substrate expression or a decline in proteasome activity  <cit> . therefore, it is not clear whether aggregated protein directly impairs proteolysis or whether its presence is a symptom of impaired proteolysis. the issues of cause versus effect require further investigation particularly in the role of ageing.

many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. these inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome  <cit> . it has been suggested that cells possess a protective mechanism to sequester and isolate toxic misfolded cytoplasmic intermediates by delivering them to ubiquitin-rich structures, called aggresomes at the microtubule-organising centre   <cit> . nuclear inclusions may serve a similar function, sequestering aggregation-prone polypeptides into relatively inert higher-order complexes. it has been demonstrated that misfolded proteins are less toxic to cells capable of forming nuclear inclusions  <cit> .

in order to be recognised and degraded by the 26s proteasome, proteins must first be tagged with chains of four or more ubiquitin molecules. ubiquitin is a small protein found in all eukaryotic organisms. ubiquitination occurs as a result of the sequential activity of three classes of enzymes, e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> . in the first step, ubiquitin is activated through atp hydrolysis mediated by an e <dig> enzyme. the activated ubiquitin is then transferred to an e <dig>  enzyme. there are approximately  <dig> different e <dig> proteins in mammalian cells  <cit>  that have limited substrate specificities. e <dig> bound to ubiquitin then forms a complex with an e <dig>  enzyme. there are hundreds of e <dig> proteins  <cit>  specific for different substrates. three classes of e <dig> proteins have been identified: the hect , the ring  finger, and the u-box domain types . the following describes the action of a hect e <dig>  as well as binding to the e2-ubiquitin complex, e <dig> binds to the protein which is to be degraded. the activated ubiquitin is then transferred to the substrate with the release of e <dig> and e <dig>  at this stage the protein is mono-ubiquitinated. further ubiquitin is then attached to form a chain by the further action of e <dig> and e <dig> enzymes. a ubiquitin chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules has physical affinity for the proteasome and delivers the substrate for degradation in an atp-dependent manner  <cit> . during degradation, the ubiquitin is released for recycling and the protein is cleaved into short peptides, which are then reduced to amino-acids by cytosolic proteases. note that for simplicity our model ignores alternative mechanisms of chain assembly  are also found within all eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in addition to processing the primary pro-protein translation products of the ubiquitin genes dubs may edit polyubiquitin chains on substrates and thereby prolong the half-life of such substrates by preventing the formation of threshold length chains required for proteasome binding.

a model of protein turnover and the role of the molecular chaperone hsp <dig> in maintaining protein homeostasis has previously been developed  <cit> . this model contains a pool of proteins in its correctly folded native state . at any point in time, a native protein can become misfolded with the rate of this reaction depending on the level of reactive oxygen species  within the cell . the pool of misfolded proteins is represented by a species misp. there are three possible outcomes for a misfolded protein. the first possibility is that a misfolded protein binds to hsp <dig> and once bound, it can either be refolded and return to the pool of native protein or it may dissociate from hsp <dig> and so remain in its misfolded state. secondly, a misfolded protein may be degraded and so removed. thirdly, a misfolded protein may bind to another misfolded protein to form a small aggregate . the model contains details of the regulation of hsp <dig> through its interaction with heat shock factor- <dig> . however, no detail is included of either the degradation pathway or the process of aggregation.

the aim of this paper is to show that the model previously used to simulate chaperone function can be extended to model ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, incorporating molecular details of this degradation system. we have also sought to incorporate details of the aggregation process. one approach would be to take the computer code for the chaperone model and then extend the code. however, a better approach is to build a new and separate model that can be tested individually and then linked with the chaperone model. a network diagram of the ubiquitin-proteasome model is given in figure  <dig>  details of how the model was built are given in the methods section.

RESULTS
normal conditions
the model was simulated with the initial values and parameter values given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. since the model is stochastic, each simulation produces slightly different results even when starting with the same set of initial values and parameter values. figure 2a shows the random fluctuations for two of the model species when simulations are repeated  <dig> times. the model predicts that the level of native protein remains fairly constant, with a mean value of  <dig>  with some small fluctuations due to stochastic effects and the level of misfolded protein remains low with a mean of  <dig>  misfolded proteins at any one time. the mean values were calculated over a five hour time period from  <dig> simulations. the model output for a range of species from a single simulation is shown in figure 2b. initially there is a very steep decline in monomeric ubiquitin corresponding to the pool of ubiquitin that binds to e <dig> and e <dig>  the pool of free ubiquitin further declines as misfolded protein is ubiquitinated. when the system settles down after about two hours, the pool of ubiquitin conjugates is larger than the pool of monomeric ubiquitin which agrees with experimental data ). the fluctuations in the ubiquitin pools are mainly due to the fluctuations in the amount of ubiquitin bound to misfolded proteins including those bound at the proteasome due to the opposing reactions of ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination. some of the variation is also caused by fluctuations in the amount of e <dig> bound to ubiquitin ). we kept track of the number of degradation reactions and the length of ubiquitin chain at the time of degradation. we found that the number of degradation reactions increases with the length of chain ). since the degradation rate does not depend on chain length, then the reason that misfolded proteins with longer polyubiquitin chains are more likely to be degraded is that they spend more time physically associated with the proteasome. under normal conditions, there is no formation of aggregates and so no inhibition of the proteasome ,). the levels of available unbound proteasomes fluctuate between  <dig> and  <dig>  as a result of varying levels in bound polyubiquitinated protein.

we carried out a sensitivity analysis to see how changing each of the model parameters affects the simulation output. the only parameters which have a significant effect on the results when increased or decreased by an order of magnitude were k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig>  varying the parameter for protein synthesis, k <dig>  affects the levels of native protein but only an increase in k <dig> has any affect on any of the other species. increasing protein synthesis leads to a depletion in monomeric ubiquitin pools due to the increase pool of protein requiring degradation. an increase in the parameter for misfolding, k <dig>  leads to an increase in misfolded protein, a decrease in native protein, all the ubiquitin ending up in conjugates and an increase in degradation. conversely, a decrease in k <dig>  leads to higher levels of native protein, more monomeric ubiquitin, less ubiquitin conjugates and less degradation. increasing the parameter for binding of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein to the proteasome, k <dig>  has no effect on the model output, but a decrease in k <dig> leads to a depletion in monomeric ubiquitin pools, an increase in unbound polyubiquitinated misfolded protein and less degradation. increasing the parameter for the chain shortening of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein, k <dig>  has the same effect as decreasing k <dig>  however, decreasing k <dig> has little effect on model output except that nearly all the degradation reactions are via the substrates with the longest ubiquitin chain. increasing the parameter for proteasome activity, k <dig>  leads to more degradation and less ubiquitin conjugates, whereas decreasing k <dig> has the opposite effect and also results in depletion of monomeric ubiquitin due to less recycling of ubiquitin.

proteasome inhibition
we carried out an in silico experiment of inhibiting the proteasome by setting the parameter k <dig> =  <dig>  the model predicts that there is initially a build up of ubiquitinated protein and that the pool of monomeric ubiquitin is depleted. the depletion of ubiquitin is followed by a steady rise in the level of misfolded protein . note that our experimental data invariably show a decline in monomeric ubiquitin in imr <dig> cells but that the results are more variable in ts <dig> cells; in some experiments there is no evidence of depletion in monomeric ubiquitin in the ts <dig> cells  this suggests that there is compensatory upregulation of ubiquitin in ts <dig> cells after proteasome inhibition. currently our model assumes that the total pool of ubiquitin remains constant but the model can easily be extended to include detail of ubiquitin turnover . the model predicts that the level of native protein is not affected, as protein synthesis continues at the same rate and so replaces any protein which becomes misfolded . aggregated protein starts to form after five hours and there is a low level of aggregates bound to proteasomes.

we also varied each of the parameters in turn to see which parameters affect the kinetics of aggregation. we found that apart from the parameters actually involved in the aggregation steps , the only parameters which affect aggregation are k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig>  either an increase in protein synthesis  or in the misfolding rate  leads to an increase in aggregated protein which in turn leads to both an increase in sequestered aggregated protein  and binding of aggregated protein to the proteasome . this is due to the increase level of misfolded protein which can not be degraded. on the other hand an increase in refolding  leads to a reduction in aggregation. increased refolding could occur if there was an upregulation in molecular chaperones. increasing the rate of binding of e <dig> to misfolded protein  also reduces the level of aggregation suggesting that, if a particular protein was involved in aggregation, then overexpressing the relevant e <dig> for a misfolded protein could help to prevent the accumulation of aggregates. however, aggregates are usually composed of a variety of proteins, so this approach may not be feasible. as expected, increasing the rate of aggregation by either increasing k <dig> or k <dig> leads to more aggregation, and varying the parameters k <dig> or k <dig> changes the ratio of seqaggp to aggp_proteasome.

parameters which affect protein turnover
by setting the rate of protein synthesis, k <dig> to zero, we can see which parameters affect the protein half-life. figure  <dig> shows that with the default parameters, the protein half-life in this model is about  <dig> hours. we both increased and decreased each of the model parameters in turn by an order of magnitude. we found that only three parameters have an effect on protein half-life: k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig>  the parameter for the protein misfolding reaction  is most sensitive with a ten-fold increase leading to a ten-fold decrease in protein half-life, and a ten-fold decrease leading to a ten-fold increase in half-life . the parameter for proteasome activity  only has an effect when decreased, with a ten-fold decrease leading to a four-fold increase in protein half-life . the reason that increasing k <dig> has no effect is that we chose parameters so that under normal conditions proteasomes are working well below their maximum capacity. a ten-fold increase in the rate of shortening the chains of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein bound to the proteasome , leads to a slight increase  in protein half-life . this is due to more bound conjugates being released instead of being degraded by the proteasome.

shutting down e <dig> activity
the ts <dig> cell line is a chinese hamster ovary line in which a temperature-sensitive mutation in e <dig> allows functional inactivation of this enzyme at the nonpermissive temperature  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the results of the wet-lab and in silico experiments wherein e <dig> activity is eliminated, and subsequent conjugation of ubiquitin precluded. when ts <dig> cells are cultured at 34°c and then subject to a temperature shift to 42°c, there is initially no decline in ubiquitin conjugates . then after  <dig> to  <dig> hours, the conjugates start to disappear and there is a corresponding increase in the monomeric pool of ubiquitin. the model predicts that when e <dig> activity is stopped , ubiquitin conjugates continue to increase for a further half hour and then they start to decline, with levels becoming low after  <dig> hours  and disappearing completely after  <dig> hours as shown in fig 5b. lowering the rate of dub activity ten-fold, slowed down the removal of ubiquitin conjugates, so that it took  <dig>  hours, after cessation of e <dig> activity for the conjugates levels to reach low levels and  <dig>  hours to completely disappear 

discussion
we have built a computer model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative process of model-building and validation of the model against experimental data. the initial conditions and parameters for the model were chosen so that the model output fitted the experimental data under normal conditions. the model was then validated by mimicking the experimental conditions such as proteasome inhibition and shutting down e <dig> activity. for example, with our original choice of parameters our model predicted that if e <dig> activity is shut down, then there is an almost immediate conversion of ubiquitin conjugates to monomeric ubiquitin. however, experimental data show that this conversion takes about two hours . therefore, we adjusted the parameters to reduce the rates of the reactions involved in ubiquitination, de-ubiquitination and degradation until the model output fitted the experimental data.

with this final set of parameters, the model output also agrees with experimental data under normal conditions and when the proteasome is inhibited. however, under conditions of proteasome inhibition our model only agrees with data for imr- <dig> cells and not ts <dig> cells with respect to the pool of monomeric ubiquitin. imr- <dig> cells are diploid fibroblast-like cells isolated from human fetal lung  <cit> ; they are nontransformed and with prolonged culture will reach the hayflick limit and undergo senescence. the ts <dig> cell line is an immortalized line derived from the e <dig> chinese hamster ovary line  <cit> . whereas cell lines were found to be variable with respect to ubiquitin content  there did not seem to be a correlation between ubiquitin content and immortalization or oncogenic transformation . it may be that the robust growth of transformed cells places demands on ubiquitin pools and that such cells have devised mechanisms to maintain or replenish their pools; if so the imr- <dig> results may be a more accurate representation of normal ubiquitin homeostasis. in order to be able to use our model for different cell types  it will be necessary to add detail of ubiquitin turnover instead of assuming a constant pool.

we carried out a sensitivity analysis to see which parameters affect the model output, not only under normal conditions but also under experimental conditions such as proteasome inhibition and shutting down e <dig> activity. under normal conditions, pools of native protein were affected by changing the protein synthesis or misfolding rate, and pools of monomeric ubiquitin were affected by changing the rate of polyubiquitinated misfolded binding to the proteasome, the rate of chain shortening of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein bound to proteasomes, or the rate of proteasome activity. under conditions of proteasome inhibition, increasing the rate of either protein synthesis or protein misfolding, or decreasing the rate of either refolding or binding of misfolded proteins to e <dig> led to an increase in protein aggregation . these results suggest that the availability of chaperones and e <dig> enzymes are important in maintaining protein homeostasis.

we also examined which parameters affect protein half-life. the most important parameter in this respect was the parameter for misfolding with a ten-fold increase/decrease leading to a ten-fold decrease/increase in protein half-life. since the misfolding reaction can be driven by the level of ros in the cell, our model would predict a similar outcome by changing ros levels, with an increase in ros leading to higher misfolding and an increase in degradation, consistent with current thought linking protein oxidation and ageing  <cit> . our model predicts that a ten-fold decrease in the rate of proteasome activity leads to a four-fold increase in protein half-life but that an increase in proteasome activity did not decrease protein half-life. it has been suggested that since proteasome levels can only increase slowly due to their slow assembly time, that they must have residual capacity for degrading proteins when cells are stressed  <cit> . our model allows for this residual capacity and explains why a ten-fold increase in proteasome activity has no effect on protein half-life.

there are also many other modifications that we could make to the model. for example, we have assumed that e <dig> binds to misfolded protein in one simple step; however it is likely that when a native protein misfolds, the first step would be for a molecular chaperone  to bind to the exposed hydrophobic surface to prevent inappropriate interactions. we could easily add this detail by including the following steps:

misp + hsp <dig> ↔ hsp90_misp 

hsp90_misp + e <dig> → e3_misp + hsp90

similarly, we could include the possibility that chaperones aid in delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome.

our model includes a hect e <dig>  but it would be easy to adapt the model for other types of e <dig> enzymes. for example if e <dig> is a ring ligase, then it has to be in complex with e <dig> before it can bind to the misfolded protein. this could be represented by the following reactions:

e <dig> + e2_ub ↔ e2_e3_ub 

misp + e2_e3_ub → e2_e3_misp_ub

e2_e3_misp_ub → misp_ub + e <dig> + e3

our model only includes one pool of long-lived proteins and so far ignores the fact that the majority of proteasome activity is involved in the turnover of short-lived regulatory proteins and also the elimination of incorrect newly-synthesised proteins. it would make the model more realistic to include an additional pool of short-lived proteins and this work is currently in progress.

we have so far restricted our models of protein turnover to the ubiquitin-proteasome system; however work is currently in progress to develop other models of protein turnover. it will be important to incorporate models of lysosomal pathways since studies suggest that protein aggregates such as mutant huntingtin are removed by autophagy .

we have included the possibility of aggregated protein inhibiting proteasomes. another possible cause of proteasome inhibition is via unaggregated damaged protein which could also sequester proteasomes. it would be fairly straight forward to add this extra detail to our current model. by running simulations over long time periods, the models can then be used to see how proteasome activity is affected by damaged and/or aggregated protein. this would be more realistic, than simply setting the parameter for proteasome activity to zero.

our model predicted that levels of native protein did not change when misfolded protein levels rise, but in reality we would not expect total protein levels to continually rise. this prediction was due to our assumption of a constant protein synthesis rate. we could later include detail of feedback mechanisms such as the unfolded protein response which downregulates translation when unfolded protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum.

we have encoded our model using sbml which not only allows for easy portability but also enables the model to be modified and extended in a very straight-forward way. the model is available on the basis website and can be freely accessed from the public repository, so that the interested reader can run simulations, make their own modifications, or download the sbml code. the basis website has a stochastic simulator and a database for storing models and simulation results.

computer models of other molecular mechanisms involved in ageing are being developed at newcastle university, for example the role of mitochondria, the antioxidant system, and dna damage signalling pathways. methods to link models in an automated way are also under development which will greatly facilitate the development of integrated models. for example, our model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system could be linked to a model of the mitochondria. this would be very valuable since neurodegeneration is not only associated with an increase in aggregated protein but also an increase in damaged mitochondrial dna  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. we have used sbml to encode the model to ensure that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process. the model and its extensions will be an invaluable aid to further our understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in maintaining protein homeostasis and how it is disturbed during ageing.
