BACKGROUND
in homo sapiens, the protein family of chemotactic cytokines, i.e. chemokines, functions as traffic coordinators for the innate defense system, but it also orchestrates lymphocyte trafficking and homeostatic cell homing in the human body. thus, chemokines represent a fundamental component in innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . however, chemokines have also been subject to various mimicry mechanisms exploited by viruses and parasites. macrophage migration inhibitory factor  is an evolutionarily ancient protein that is best known for its functions as an immune and inflammatory factor and that was more recently recognized to have chemokine-like properties to regulate a plethora of processes in the biology and pathophysiology of humans  <cit> . mif is a prototypical member of the growing functional family of clf  chemokines that share with classical chemokines chemokine receptor-mediated chemotaxis and cell recruitment activities, but that do not possess the canonical n-terminal cysteine residues or chemokine-fold  <cit> . human mif  has  <dig> amino acids, forms a trimer in the x-ray structure  <cit> , and is a required upstream component of human innate and adaptive immunity, but it is also overexpressed in various human diseases  <cit> . if dysregulated, hsmif is a pivotal mediator of inflammatory, infectious and immune diseases including septic shock, colitis, malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis, as well as in several tumors  <cit> . in fact, hsmif was discovered already 50 years ago, but it took until the early 1990s and mid-2000s until the mif protein was characterized and the mif receptors were identified, respectively  <cit> . mif functions are mediated through three receptor proteins: on the one hand, mif signals through the type ii receptor protein cd74/invariant chain, but on the other hand it also serves as a non-cognate ligand for the classical cxc chemokine receptors cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  <cit> .

the structural interfaces governing mif/receptor interactions have partly been unraveled, but important mechanistic details of its structure-activity characteristics, cell- and environment-specific receptor usage, cross-reactivity, interplay with bona fide ligands, or receptor complexes are unclear  <cit> . moreover, mif is abundantly expressed in the cytosol of numerous cells and features two evolutionarily conserved catalytic sites, i.e. a dopachrome tautomerase and a thiol-protein oxidoreductase  activity, implying links to mif’s role in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . the catalytic activities have been suggested to localize to a three-dimensional proline-2-containing tautomerase site at the n-terminus and a cys-xaa-xaa-cys motif-spanning sequence at amino acids 57– <dig>  respectively. both catalytic hsmif activities can be readily measured in vitro, but physiologic substrates have been elusive and the functional role of the activities in vivo is unclear. strikingly, hsmif and its human paralog mif-2/d-dt  are found across kingdoms with expression verified in mammals, xenopus laevis, caenorhabditis elegans, bifidobacterium longum, clostridium acetobutylicum, or unicellular parasites such as brugia malayi. while co-expression of ddt and mif has been observed in some species, functional evidence on ddt has been scarce. ddt shares with mif an exacerbating role in endotoxic shock and models of melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and renal tumorigenesis, and mimics the cardioprotective effect of mif in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury of the heart  <cit> . in contrast, the effects of ddt on cell survival and apoptosis are complex and the receptor mechanisms conveying ddt activity are unclear at the molecular level. also, a combined functional analysis of both mif proteins in other organisms has not yet been undertaken.

arabidopsis thaliana is a dicotyledonous plant species and is arguably the best-studied model plant  <cit> . although its genome sequence has been resolved more than a decade ago  <cit> , approximately half of its ca.  <dig>  genes remain functionally unknown or are annotated only on the basis of static analyses such as protein motifs or similarities  <cit> . the uncharacterized genes also include apparent mif-like genes, whose existence in the arabidopsis genome has been previously noted  <cit> . however, the genes have not yet attained any attention by the plant or cytokine/chemokine community, and accordingly neither the genes nor the respective gene products have been characterized to date.

to further broaden the understanding of the role of mif-like proteins across kingdoms we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of plant mif/ddt-like  genes/proteins with an emphasis on the reference species arabidopsis thaliana. we deployed several analysis tools to unravel the copy number, gene structure, expression profile and predicted subcellular localization of the arabidopsis mdl genes/proteins. we extended the study by sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis including a broad range of mdl sequences across the entire plant kingdom.

RESULTS
arabidopsis thaliana encodes three mif-like proteins
we performed blastp searches against the predicted proteome of the dicotyledonous reference species arabidopsis thaliana  using human mif  as a query sequence. this analysis revealed three hits with moderate sequence similarity to hsmif, comprising proteins at5g <dig> , at5g <dig>  and at3g <dig> . the three proteins are of similar length as human mif and ddt ; accordingly, their calculated molecular weight is within a comparable range . these values refer to the conceptual full-length proteins as predicted from the corresponding cdna sequences. human mif and ddt are known to undergo proteolytic processing of the n-terminal methionine and thus in its mature form comprise only  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively  <cit> . the sequence similarity to human mif and ddt extends nearly along the entire protein, with  <dig> invariant amino acid residues interspersed, except for the very c-terminus, which shows little sequence conservation between the five aligned proteins . the  <dig> invariant amino acids include a proline at position  <dig> , which is essential for the tautomerase activity of hsmif  <cit> . by contrast, the two cysteine residues  that form the tpor motif and are crucial for the oxidoreductase activity in hsmif  <cit>  are not preserved in the arabidopsis proteins . the arabidopsis proteins also lack the so-called pseudo elr motif . this sequence motif, which is comprised of the amino acids glutamate , leucine  and arginine , is found in a variety of chemokines. it is critical for receptor binding and essential for chemotactic activity of elr+ cxc chemokines  <cit> . in hsmif, it is present in a non-canonical manner , constituted by non-adjacent residues in neighboring loops but with identical parallel spacing as in the authentic elr motif  <cit> .table  <dig>

analysis with interproscan  <dig>  indicated the presence of characteristic mif  and tautomerase  domains as the sole recognizable features in the three arabidopsis proteins . accordingly, we named these arabidopsis mif/ddt-like  polypeptides atmdl <dig> , atmdl <dig>  and atmdl <dig> , although the ipr <dig> motif --x-s---x--), which is located at amino acids 55– <dig> in hsmif and hsddt and corresponds to the catalytic tpor site in hsmif, is missing in the three arabidopsis proteins . the three atmdl proteins exhibit considerable pairwise sequence similarity with atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig>  showing a higher degree of relatedness to each other than to atmdl <dig> . this is somewhat higher than the kinship of hsmif and hsddt, which exhibit 37% identity and 52% similarity. despite the high overall degree of sequence relationship, the calculated isoelectric point  of the three arabidopsis mdl proteins differs greatly, with a pi of  <dig>  for atmdl <dig>   <dig>  for atmdl <dig> and  <dig>  for atmdl <dig>  as compared to a pi of  <dig>  for hsmif and  <dig>  for hsddt . the three arabidopsis mdl proteins and their respective genes are largely uncharacterized since according to our literature searches no studies with functional data are available to date.

genomic organization and distribution of atmdl genes
for atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig>  the arabidopsis reference database tair  lists two distinctive gene models each . these models differ in the number of exons/introns and the localization of splice sites, resulting in different predicted transcripts, which suggests the potential occurrence of alternative splicing events at the transcript level. however, blast searches against arabidopsis expressed sequence tags  at the ncbi database solely support gene models at5g <dig>  and at5g <dig> , suggesting that the two other models  may either rely on faulty genome annotation or may represent rare splicing variants. in the following, we therefore only considered the conceptual amino acid sequences that are based on gene models at5g <dig>  and at5g <dig> .

atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> are characterized by the presence of two introns, while atmdl <dig> has a single intron. the former is similar to the situation of hsmif, which also harbors two introns, whereas the human ddt gene has three introns, of which the first is located outside the coding sequence in the 5´-untranslated region. notably, the relative position of the first intron in atmdl <dig>  atmdl <dig> and hsmif, the second intron in hsddt and the sole intron in atmdl <dig> is precisely preserved . this finding indicates common ancestry of the plant and human mif/ddt genes and suggests that at least part of the genomic organization of the mif/ddt genes has been retained since the separation of the plant and animal lineages ca.  <dig>  billion years ago  <cit> . the relative positions of the second introns are also conserved for atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> on the one hand and hsmif and hsddt on the other hand, indicating the acquisition of lineage-specific introns later during evolution .

the arabidopsis thaliana genome has been shaped by a whole genome duplication event, which resulted in extended yet reshuffled blocks of tandem repeated genomic regions that exhibit large-scale conservation in the number, order and orientation of genes  <cit> . interrogation of the plant genome duplication database  revealed that none of the atmdl genes has a recognizable counterpart as the result of intragenomic duplication. this finding suggests that the diversification of the atmdl genes occurred prior to the whole genome duplication event, which has been estimated to have occurred ca.  <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

structure prediction of atmdl proteins
the three-dimensional  structure of hsmif has been initially resolved by x-ray crystallography at  <dig>  Å resolution  <cit> . hsmif crystallizes as a trimer, while solution analyses have produced variable results about the oligomerization state of hsmif, ranging from monomer to dimer or trimer species depending on the protein concentration and method applied  <cit> . the hsmif monomer consists of two antiparallel α-helices that pack against a four-stranded β-sheet. a 3d topology with similar structural elements was subsequently determined for hsddt on the basis of x-ray crystallography at a resolution of  <dig>  Å  <cit> . we used the fold recognition server phyre <dig>  to predict in silico the 3d structure of the three atmdl monomers. this analysis, which is based on homology modelling, revealed a surprisingly well conserved tentative 3d structure of the arabidopsis mdl proteins in comparison to hsmif , despite the limited similarity of these proteins at the level of the primary amino acid sequence . the noted architectural conservation is reminiscent of the high degree of 3d similarity between mammalian mif/ddt proteins and tautomerase-active homologs found in protists  and bacteria  and 5--2-hydroxymuconate isomerase . further support for similar structures of hsmif and the atmdl proteins is provided by a second structure prediction algorithm , which allows ab initio calculation of protein 3d structures. although the 3d structure of hsmif monomer predicted with quark differs from the experimentally determined structure , quark calculated similar 3d structures for hsmif and the three atmdl proteins . together these findings further strengthen the notion that the atmdl proteins are bona fide co-orthologs of hsmif and hsddt that may share functional conservation with respect to core biochemical activities of this protein class. we further visualized the electrostatic surface potential of these proteins to find out whether the noted differences in the pi of mif/mdl proteins  is reflected by prominent alterations in surface charge distribution. since this was not the case, we speculate that the amino acids causing the charge differences are either not surface-exposed and/or distributed to such an extent that differences become unrecognizable.figure  <dig> predicted atmdl 3d structures. amino acid sequences of the atmdl proteins were subjected to analysis via the phyre <dig> fold recognition server  and rendered with pymol . the predicted 3d structures  of atmdl <dig>  atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> are visualized in comparison to the known x-ray-resolved 3d structure of hsmif. in the upper panels, green arrows symbolize β-sheets and green coils α-helices. in the lower panels, red color indicates an excess of negative and blue color an excess of positive charges near the surface, while white color specifies neutral regions. for simplicity, the structure of the monomer is shown only. a view with the four-stranded β-sheet in front. b view with the two antiparallel α-helices in front.



subcellular localization of atmdl proteins
using a panel of prediction servers, we inspected the three atmdls in silico for the presence of canonical targeting signals that could provide first hints on their subcellular localization. all three proteins lack a number of analyzed targeting signals for dedicated subcellular localization, including n-terminal secretion signals , transmembrane domains , transit peptides for mitochondrial  or chloroplast  localization and nuclear import signals . lack of these sequence motif features is shared by hsmif and hsddt, which are secreted by non-conventional pathways that do not require er/golgi transit  <cit> . however, atmdl <dig> has a predicted leucine-rich nuclear export signal  at amino acid positions 85– <dig> and atmdl <dig> possesses a predicted c-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence  . notably, the predicted nes is shared by hsmif, where this putative signal occurs at the corresponding relative position .

two of the three atmdls have been previously identified in shot-gun proteomic studies of arabidopsis organelles. atmdl <dig> was found as a stromal protein in the chloroplast proteome  <cit>  and atmdl <dig> was discovered as a peroxisomal protein  <cit> . the latter localization is consistent with the presence of a c-terminal pts <dig> localization signal in atmdl <dig>  and also with fluorophore-based subcellular localization studies  <cit> , whereas the experimentally found stromal localization of atmdl <dig> is not supported by a recognizable chloroplast-targeting sequence. nevertheless, further experimental evidence is needed to substantiate the predicted subcellular localization of the atmdl proteins.

expression profiles of atmdl genes
we used an arabidopsis microarray-based gene expression analysis tool  to analyze the expression profiles of the three atmdl genes in different tissues, during development and upon different abiotic and biotic stress cues. we found that atmdl <dig> and in particular atmdl <dig> show fairly constitutive expression in most aerial plant tissues and during most developmental stages, whereas expression in roots is comparatively low. in contrast to this broad expression pattern, atmdl <dig> expression seems to be restricted to cotyledons, rosette leaves and sepals . overall, atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> show higher basal transcript levels than atmdl <dig>  but reveal little alteration in transcript levels upon abiotic or biotic stress cues. by contrast, atmdl <dig> exhibits strongly enhanced transcript accumulation in leaves upon cold treatment  and a less dramatic increase following osmotic stress, wounding and uv-b treatment . atmdl <dig> shows also elevated transcript levels in leaves upon exposure to various biotic stresses, including microbial elicitors  and pathogens . taken together, atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> reveal comparatively constant expression levels in most organs, tissues and conditions, whereas atmdl <dig> is characterized by lower basal levels, but elevated transcript accumulation in response to various abiotic and biotic stress cues.

co-expressed genes and interacting proteins
co-expression of genes has recently been recognized as one possible predictor of gene products that cooperate in a given process or biochemical pathway  <cit> . accordingly, a number of databases have been established to explore potential gene co-expression. we used the online tool atted-ii  to identify arabidopsis genes that are co-expressed with the three atmdl genes. for each gene we retrieved a list of the top  <dig> co-expressed genes and compared these for potential communalities. we noted that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes co-expressed with atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> are identical , suggesting that the two genes are largely expressed in the same conditions, together with a shared set of genes. among these common genes is a conspicuously high number of genes coding for cytosolic or plastid-specific ribosomal proteins . we subjected the co-expressed genes to pageman-based overrepresentation analysis . this indeed revealed statistically highly significant  overrepresentation of genes encoding cytoplasmic  and plastid-specific  ribosomal proteins . interestingly, human ribosomal protein rps <dig> has been identified to interact with hsmif  <cit> , suggesting that association with ribosomes and/or ribosomal proteins could be a general feature of mif-like proteins. notably, none of the genes that were found to be co-expressed with atmdl <dig> or atmdl <dig> is co-expressed with atmdl <dig> or vice versa, indicating that atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> on the one hand and atmdl <dig> on the other hand may function in fundamentally different biological processes. we noted the occurrence of several genes firmly implicated in plant defence among the top  <dig> genes co-expressed with atmdl <dig>  including pen <dig>  <cit> , pen <dig>  <cit> , pad4/sag <dig>  <cit> , sid <dig>  <cit> , efr  <cit> , sobir <dig>  <cit> , different wrky genes  <cit> , as well as mlo <dig> and mlo <dig>  <cit> . however, atmdl <dig> is not an integral part of the previously described defence regulon  <cit> , although the genes of the defence regulon and the set of atmdl3-co-expressed genes partially overlap . in further support of a putative function in plant immunity, pageman analysis indicated statistically highly significant  overrepresentation of receptor kinases among the genes co-expressed with atmdl <dig> . in sum, the results of the co-expression analysis are consistent with the expression profiles of the three atmdl genes, which indicated mostly constitutive expression of atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> and stress-inducible expression of atmdl <dig> .

we next interrogated the plant interactome database  for potentially known physical interactors of the three atmdl proteins. this revealed one identified interactor each  for atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig>  the protein interacting with atmdl <dig> is at2g <dig> , a protein implicated in dna repair, while atmdl <dig> interacted with at5g <dig>  a protein of unknown function. the biological relevance of these interaction partners identified by yeast-based methods remains, however, to be shown.

mdl proteins in other plant species
to explore to which extent mdl genes are also present in other plant species, we performed blast searches with a focus on fully sequenced and annotated plant genomes at the plant genome database . we included species that represent different levels of plant evolution, i.e. green algae , a bryophyte , a lycophyte , a gymnosperm  and various angiosperms . in some cases we found mdl proteins with otherwise identical amino acid sequences but differing c-termini in the database. these likely comprise annotated splice variants of the same gene locus, as reported above for atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> . for consistency, in these cases we only included the variants that seemingly resemble the atmdl versions, although we cannot rule out that some of the putative splice variants might be biologically meaningful. similarly, we removed variants that are nearly identical and possibly just the result of sequencing errors or natural genetic variation within a species.

we discovered that each species harbors genes encoding mdl proteins, with typically multiple copies  present per species, except the non-vascular plants , which encode a single mdf protein each . we also noted a trend towards a higher number of mdl paralogs in dicotyledonous than in monocotyledonous plant species, with an average of  <dig>  paralogs per dicotyledonous species and no species having less than three paralogs, compared to two paralogs per monocotyledonous species.table  <dig>

using clustalw <dig> we generated a multiple sequence alignment of the curated set of plant mdl proteins identified in the context of our blast searches . this analysis revealed seven invariant amino acids  plus a number of highly conserved residues. each of the invariant residues is also present in hsmif and hsddt , suggesting that these are crucial amino acids for the structure and/or function of mdl proteins. overall, there is good conservation of amino acid sequences along the entire plant proteins, except at the very c-terminus. as expected, the angiosperm mdl sequences showed the highest level of conservation, while the sequences of the more distantly related gymnosperms, the lycophyte s. moellendorffii and the non-vascular plants  were more variable.

the multiple sequence alignment revealed that most plant mdl proteins harbor either one or no cysteine residue. exceptions are the algal mdl sequences of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri, which include two cysteine residues, and one of the s. moellendorfii sequences with three cysteines . if present, the cysteine residues are in positions different from those seen in hsmif. thus, the vast majority of plant mdl proteins lack the capacity to form an intramolecular disulphide bridge.

we recognized the occurrence of potential variants of the c-terminal pts <dig> peroxisome localization signal in some of the sequences. closer inspection of these amino acid sequences with pts <dig> predictor  indeed corroborated the presence of likely pts <dig> sequences in most of these proteins, while prediction results were ambiguous for two of the analyzed polypeptides . these findings suggest that not only atmdl <dig>  but also mdl proteins of other plant species localize to peroxisomes. we noted that each dicotyledonous plant seems to encode one putatively peroxisome-localized mdl paralog, while these were apparently absent from monocotyledonous plants and outside the angiosperm lineage . this notion was further substantiated by dedicated blast searches using atmdl <dig> as a query sequence, which revealed that pts1-carrying mdl sequences appear to be restricted to dicotyledonous plant species. a basic isoelectric point as recognized for atmdl <dig>  seems to be a common feature of these mdl proteins, as they all exhibit calculated pi values of  <dig> - <dig> .

unlike the predicted pts <dig> signal in atmdl <dig>  which could be also recognized in several paralogs from other plant species, the predicted nes in atmdl <dig> could not be confirmed in the atmdl <dig> relatives. although all amino acid sequences from this clade show a tendency towards an nes in the respective region , the threshold for a positive prediction is only passed in the case of atmdl <dig> . the relevance of these in silico analyses remains to be tested experimentally.

phylogenetic analysis of plant mdl proteins
we extended our study by performing phylogenetic analysis of the subset of plant mdl protein sequences applying two widely used computational phylogenetic methods . results of these analyses consistently revealed that atmdl <dig> is a member of a clade that comprises sequences from both mono- and dicotyledonous plant species . by contrast, results differ for atmdl <dig>  while the distance matrix-based neighbor-joining method indicates that the atmdl <dig> clade also harbors sequences from both mono- and dicotyledonous plant species , the probability-based maximum likelihood tree separates mdl members from these two lineages . in both phylogenetic trees the two sequences of the gymnosperm plant p. sitchensis each group as sister branches of these major clades, suggesting that the respective dichotomous split occurred before the gymnosperm-angiosperm separation ca.  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . in the neighbor-joining tree, the moss  mdl sequence groups together with the atmdl <dig> clade and one of the four lycophyte  sequences, suggesting that this branch reflects the most ancestral mdls of land plants. this issue remains, however, unresolved in the maximum likelihood tree.figure  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of plant mdl sequences. the evolutionary history of mdl proteins was inferred using either the neighbor-joining method  or the maximum likelihood method based on the jtt matrix-based model . the analysis involved  <dig> mdl sequences. all ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. evolutionary analyses were conducted in mega <dig>  <cit> . atmdl <dig>  atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> are shown in bold. angiosperm mdl proteins grouping with the arabidopsis proteins are coloured in green, red and blue, respectively. a the optimal tree with the sum of branch length =  <dig>  is shown. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  is shown next to the branches  <cit> . the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. the evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method  <cit>  and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site. b the tree with the highest log likelihood  is shown. the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. initial tree for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. when the number of common sites was <  <dig> or less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise bionj method with mcl distance matrix was used. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site.



atmdl <dig> is a member of a discrete clade, containing exclusively sequences of dicotyledonous mdl proteins with a predicted c-terminal peroxisome localization signal. this clade is a sister clade of the atmdl2-containing clade, suggesting that the atmdl <dig> lineage originates from a gene duplication event, involving a common progenitor of atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig>  after the divergence of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species ca.  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . as expected, human hsmif and hsddt cluster as out-groups in both trees and show closest relationship to mdl sequences from primitive plants such as green algae and three out of the four lycophyte mdls.

based on the phylogenetic separation we established dedicated clade-specific sequence alignments of atmdl1-, atmdl2- and atmdl3-like angiosperm mdl proteins . this revealed that atmdl2-like sequences show the highest degree of sequence conservation, with  <dig> invariant amino acids within this clade, as compared to  <dig> and  <dig> invariant amino acids in atmdl1- and atmdl3-like sequences, respectively.

discussion
our in silico analysis revealed that plant mdl proteins resemble hsmif and hsddt with regard to primary amino acid sequence and predicted three-dimensional structure . together with the presence of this type of protein in other kingdoms of life , this finding suggests a common evolutionarily preserved core biochemical function for mdl proteins. human mif is a multifunctional polypeptide with at least three biological activities. first, it serves a role as an extracellular cytokine/chemokine that binds to the hla class ii histocompatibility antigen gamma chain  or to the classical cxc chemokine receptors cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  thereby modulating innate immune responses  <cit> . the significance of a more broad relationship of hsmif to classical chemokine receptors was most recently corroborated by the discovery of hsmif/cxcr <dig> interactions on platelets  <cit> . of note, this suggests that cxcr <dig> shares with cxcr <dig> not only the cognate ligand cxcl <dig>  but also interacts with hsmif,  <cit> . in addition, hsmif has two physically separated catalytic sites that confer tautomerase as well as oxidoreductase activity, although the authentic in vivo substrates of these enzymatic activities remain unknown  <cit> . the contribution of these catalytic activities to hsmif´s chemokine function is controversially discussed and has not been fully resolved  <cit> .

plant mdl proteins seem to lack at least two of these three roles, namely chemokine function and oxidoreductase activity. unlike vertebrates, plants do not have professional mobile immune cells such as macrophages. instead each plant cell largely relies on its own capacity to combat microbial intruders . consistent with this type of innate immunity, plants do not possess components such as chemokines that could attract migrating immune cells to biotic stress sites. plant mdl proteins are therefore unlikely to be secreted as signaling molecules to the extracellular space. this notion is supported by the absence of a recognizable n-terminal secretion signal and the lack of the so-called pseudo-elr motif. lack of a canonical n-terminal secretion signal in hsmif in conjunction with experimental findings has led to the view that human mif and ddt are secreted via unconventional secretion pathways  <cit> . it nevertheless remains at least a formal possibility that also plant mdl proteins exert an extracellular function. in favor of this latter notion would be the finding that atmdl <dig> and related plant mdls exhibit a fairly basic pi value above  <dig> . hsmif has a pi value of  <dig>  and it is believed that this feature contributes to endothelial deposition of extracellular mif, similar to the well-known arrest chemokines  <cit> . the some  <dig> classical chemokines generally exhibit basic pi values in the range between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and it is this biophysical property that guarantees their endothelial immobilization following secretion on the extensively acidic proteoglycan  layer of the endothelium. once immobilized, chemokines form a haptotactic gradient enabling them to mediate leukocyte arrest and transmigration during homeostatic homing processes or in inflammatory leukocyte extravasation  <cit> . in fact, acidic proteoglycans have been proposed to function as co-receptors in leukocyte arrest  <cit> . biochemical evidence for direct mif-proteoglycan interaction is still missing, but both human and mouse mif are known to be deposited on the endothelial surface following secretion from endothelial cells and/or leukocytes and thrombocytes, promoting leukocyte activation and arrest  <cit> . moreover, the surface form of cd74/invariant chain, a receptor for human and mouse mif, is chondroitin sulfate-modified, a posttranslational prerequisite necessary for high affinity interaction with mif  <cit> .

two closely linked cysteine residues form the central part of the tpor site that is required for oxidoreductase activity in hsmif . these paired cysteines are thought to serve a thioredoxin-like role during redox reactions catalyzed by hsmif. to also exert such an enzymatic activity the presence of paired cysteine residues would be expected in plant mdl proteins. however, most plant mdls either have none or only one cysteine residue, with only few plant mdls harboring two or more cysteines . exceptions are the algal mifs encoded by the c. reinhardtii and v. carteri genomes, which each possess two similarly spaced cysteines in the same relative position . based on these amino acid features it is conceivable that at least the majority of plant mdls do not possess oxidoreductase activity. this is in agreement with mif-like proteins from several other non-vertebrate species, which were also suggested to lack this catalytic capacity  <cit> . however, it seems that plant mdls have the principal potential to share tautomerase activity with their counterparts from other kingdoms of life . evidence for this assumption is conservation of an n-terminal proline residue that is known to form the catalytic site for tautomerase activity . since to our knowledge this sequence feature is present in all mif proteins known so far, tautomerase activity could be the ancestral function of mdls. although no in vivo tautomerase substrate has been identified, the presumed conservation of tautomerase activity may hint at a chemical or chemical class whose presence is conserved across a broad range of taxa. d-dopachrome has been recognized as an artificial substrate of hsmif and other mdls  <cit> . this compound is a cyclization product of l- <dig> -dihydroxyphenylalanine  and an intermediate in the biosynthesis of melanin-type pigments. l-dopa is best known for its role as a precursor molecule of various human neurotransmitters, but it also exists in plants where it seems to serve a role as precursor of different secondary plant metabolites  <cit> . although plants lack conventional melanins, they are able to synthesize catechol melanin, which is also chemically related to l-dopa  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether the natural substrate of mdl´s tautomerase activity is indeed related to l-dopa.

we observed a tendency towards an increased copy number of mdl genes with increasing organismal complexity within the plant lineage. while evolutionarily older non-vascular plants such as algae and mosses contain only one mdl copy, evolutionarily younger vascular plants contain two or more paralogs . a further increase in complexity of the mdl gene family can be seen within the angiosperm clade: while monocotyledonous plant species typically have two mdl copies, dicotyledonous species encode three or more mdl paralogs . the additional copy in dicotyledonous plant species represents a type of mdl with unique gene and protein features. this mdl type, in arabidopsis represented by atmdl <dig>  has a c-terminal peroxisome targeting sequence  and a different overall amino acid composition, as reflected by a markedly higher isoelectric point and a separate position within the phylogenetic tree . moreover, the respective gene has at least in arabidopsis a different genomic organization , is the only arabidopsis mdl that shows stimulus-dependent expression, and is co-expressed with a unique gene set . together, these features point to neofunctionalization of this plant mdl paralog in dicotyledonous plants.

the arabidopsis product of this mdl paralog  is predicted  and has been experimentally shown  to localize to peroxisomes. plant peroxisomes are involved in numerous biological processes, including primary and secondary metabolism, development, as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stress cues. similar to peroxisomes in mammalian cells, they are best known for their role in fatty acid oxidation . in plants, they are also involved in the biosynthesis of the phytohormones indole acetic acid  and jasmonic acid and they contribute to the process of photorespiration  <cit> . transcript accumulation of atmdl <dig> is responsive to various abiotic and biotic stress stimuli, indicating that the respective protein may play a role in these conditions. indeed, peroxisomes have been found to be responsive to abiotic stress  <cit>  and biotic stress  <cit> . with regard to the latter, pen <dig>  an atypical myrosinase presumably involved in the biosynthesis of toxic glucosinolate metabolites, has been found to be associated with peroxisomes  <cit> . notably, pen <dig>  which is also part of an antifungal defence regulon  <cit> , is in the list of genes co-expressed with atmdl <dig> . accordingly, atmdl <dig> may have a role in pathogen defence. if this was true, and if this was a general feature of angiosperm atmdl3-like proteins, then we may face the situation of convergent evolution in higher plants and mammals/vertebrates, characterized by neofunctionalization of mifs/mdls towards a role in innate immunity.

the remaining two types of plant mdls  show constitutive expression and are both co-expressed with an overlapping set of genes. this essentially resembles the expression profile of hsmif, which was also described to be constitutively expressed in immune cells and stress-responsive tissues of the endocrine system  <cit> . among the genes co-expressed with atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> are a remarkably high number of genes encoding ribosomal proteins. notably, hsmif has been reported to interact with ribosomal protein s <dig> , thereby attenuating its pro-inflammatory function  <cit> . as rps <dig> can be released in inflammatory lesions by apoptotic cells, it has been suggested to act as an extracellular negative regulator of mif function in this context  <cit> . co-expression with a greater number of genes coding for ribosomal proteins suggests that at least atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> may act together with ribosomes, e.g. during protein biosynthesis. the similar expression pattern and an overlapping set of co-expressed genes further indicate that the two genes might be functionally redundant in arabidopsis. owing to a lack of dedicated targeting sequences, one might expect that the atmdl <dig> and atmdl <dig> proteins localize to the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus . the functional relevance of a putative nes detected in atmdl <dig> awaits experimental verification.

only two proteins have so far been identified as interaction partners of arabidopsis mdls. according to large-scale yeast two-hybrid data atmdl <dig> interacts with at2g <dig>  and atmdl <dig> interacts with at5g <dig> . none of these interactions has been validated in planta so far. in contrast to the atmdl proteins, a substantial number of interacting proteins have been identified for hsmif. these comprise pag  <cit> , jab/csn <dig>  <cit> , bnipl  <cit> , hpo  <cit>  and rps <dig> . since currently no common theme or interrelation of these interaction partners can be recognized, one may speculate that hsmif functions through a number interactions with a diverse set of proteins.

to further unravel the function of plant mdls, genetic, molecular and cell biological analyses will be necessary. t-dna insertion lines for all three atmdl genes can be found in public repositories  and could be used to identify potential phenotypes of atmdl knock-out plants. further protein-protein interaction screens are required to uncover additional interaction partners of the arabidopsis mdl proteins. moreover, in planta assays will be necessary to validate these yeast-based interactors. subcellular localization studies using fluorophore-tagged proteins will shed light on the cellular site of action of the arabidopsis mdls. analysis of plant mdls may help to finally get a hold of the long-sought after natural substrates of the mif/ddt tautomerase activities.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed an in depth in silico analysis of plant mdl proteins. this unraveled that mif/ddt-like proteins are present in all plant taxa, with an increasing number of paralogs in higher plant species. plant mdls share extensive sequence similarity  and predicted 3d structure  with their non-plant counterparts. they are predicted to lack oxidoreductase activity but possibly retained tautomerase activity as catalytic function. phylogenetic analysis  allowed reconstruction and time estimates of the likely phylogeny of the mdl protein family in the course of plant evolution. the genome of the dicotyledonous model plant species arabidopsis thaliana harbors three mdl genes, of which two are constitutively expressed and share an overlapping set of co-expressed genes, many of which code for ribosomal proteins. the third gene exhibits stress-inducible transcript accumulation and is co-expressed with a number of genes implicated in plant immunity. this gene encodes an mdl variant  with a c-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal . the  expression pattern and subcellular localization of atmdl <dig> suggest convergent evolution in higher plants and vertebrates towards mdl variants with a novel role in innate immunity. precedence for such a scenario is provided by the convergent neofunctionalization of xanthine dehydrogenase towards aldehyde oxidase after recurring gene duplication events  <cit> . functional analyses will be required to validate this hypothetical convergent neofunctionalization of mdl proteins in two separate kingdoms of life.

the comprehensive characterization of plant mdl proteins as undertaken in this study should aid in understanding the broader biological role of these proteins across kingdoms and should form the basis for future experimental work on these proteins. the catalytic activities of mif have been extensively studied by numerous laboratories across the globe for more than 15 years. however, most of these studies have focused on the pure in vitro activity. moreover, the physiologically relevant substrates have remained elusive and the functional role of these activities in mif’s physiologic and pathophysiologic activities in humans and rodents is still unclear and under debate. studying the catalytic activities of mdl proteins in plants and identifying novel mdl interaction partners could thus aid in uncovering the long sought-after natural substrates.

a broad body of evidence now clearly suggests that hsmif is an evolutionarily conserved protein that has both intra- and extracellular functions. in the human and mouse studies, the extracellular activities of mif have been primarily addressed, with mostly only indirect evidence obtained about its intracellular effects. we therefore hypothesize that clarifying mif’s role in a remote organism/kingdom such as plants in which a circulation/extracellular space-based mobile immune and defense system is missing, could provide valuable novel information about mif’s intracellular effects, assuming that these are highly conserved and likely appeared first in the evolution of mif proteins.
