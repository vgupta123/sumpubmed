BACKGROUND
klebsiella pneumoniae, a member of enterobacteriaceae, is a rod-shaped gram-negative opportunistic pathogen. a common cause of nosocomial infection, it is also found in various community-acquired infections, including bacteraemia, septicaemia, and urinary tract and respiratory infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients  <cit> . in asian countries, especially taiwan and korea, k. pneumoniae is the predominant pathogen found in pyogenic liver abscess in diabetic patients  <cit> . the rapid development of antimicrobial resistance in k. pneumoniae has further troubled the clinical choices for treatments  <cit> . studies of the pathogenic mechanisms of k. pneumoniae are, therefore, essential in identifying new targets for the development of antibacterial agents.

multiple virulence factors have been identified to be involved in k. pneumoniae infection, which include capsular polysaccharide , lipopolysaccharides, fimbriae, iron-acquisition system, and antibiotic resistance. among these factors, cps is probably considered the major determinants of pathogenesis. the pyogenic liver abscess isolates often carry heavy cps that could protect the bacteria from phagocytosis and killing by serum factors  <cit> . apart from the antiphagocytic function, klebsiella cps also helps the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation at the infection sites  <cit> . the capsular serotypes of k. pneumoniae have been classified as more than  <dig> recognized capsular antigens  <cit> . in taiwan, a high prevalence of k <dig> and k <dig> serotypes of k. pneumoniae was documented in liver abscess of diabetes mellitus patients  <cit> . the cps gene clusters that are responsible for the synthesis of different serotypes of cps have been determined  <cit> . the k <dig> cps gene cluster of k. pneumoniae chedid contains a total number of  <dig> open reading frames  organized into three transcription units, orf1-2orf3- <dig>  and orf16- <dig>  <cit> . in the previous studies, numerous regulatory systems were demonstrated to control the biosynthesis of cps via regulating the cps transcriptions in k. pneumoniae, such as the rcs system, rmpa, rmpa <dig>  kvhr, kvgas, and kvhas  <cit> . among these, ferric uptake regulator  represses the gene expression of rcsarmpa, and rmpa <dig> to decrease cps biosynthesis  <cit> . therefore, overlapping regulons governed the regulation of these assorted virulence genes in response to numerous stress conditions.

bacterial cells are constantly challenged by various environmental stresses from their natural habitats. similar to many gastrointestinal  pathogens, k. pneumoniae faces several challenges during infection and colonisation of the human body. these include gastric acid, the immune system, and a limited supply of oxygen and nutrients  <cit> . among these, the concentration of iron in the environment is critical for the control of cellular metabolism. limitation of iron abolishes bacterial growth, but high intracellular concentrations of iron may damage bacteria because of the formation of undesired reactive oxygen species . iron homeostasis maintained by the transport, storage, and metabolism of iron is tightly controlled by fur in many gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . to regulate gene transcription, fur protein functions as a dimer with fe2+ as a cofactor to bind to a 19-bp consensus sequence, called the fur box , in the promoters of downstream genes  <cit> . in several gram-negative pathogens, fur represses the expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis and in the regulation of multiple cellular functions such as oxidative stress, energy metabolism, acid tolerance, and virulence gene production  <cit> . in k. pneumoniae, fur plays a dual role in controlling cps biosynthesis and iron acquisition  <cit> . recently, we also found that type  <dig> fimbriae expression and bacterial biofilm formation were also controlled by fur and iron availability  <cit> . therefore, the regulatory mechanism of fur in control of multiple cellular function and virulence factors in k. pneumoniae needs to be further investigated.

although fur typically acts as a repressor, it also functions as a transcriptional activator for the gene expression such as acnafuma, and sdhcdab , bfr and ftna , and sodb   <cit> . however, positive regulation by fur is often indirect, mediated by fur-dependent repression of a small non-coding rna , ryhb  <cit> . ryhb negatively regulates gene expression by base pairing with mrnas to trigger their degradation via rnase e and rnase iii  <cit> . in many bacteria, ryhb participates in fur-mediated positive regulation of various important cellular functions, including tca cycle activity, resistance to oxidative stress, and iron homeostasis in escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae  <cit> ; biofilm formation in v. cholerae  <cit> ; and virulence in shigella dysenteriae  <cit> . in e. coli, ryhb has been demonstrated to directly regulate more than  <dig> transcripts, encoding a total of  <dig> proteins, most of them involved in iron metabolism  <cit> . although the significance of ryhb has been demonstrated in different species, to date, the regulatory relationship of ryhb and fur, and functionality of ryhb in k. pneumoniae has not been studied.

in this study, the regulatory role of fur in ryhb expression in k. pneumoniae was investigated. a ryhb-deletion mutant in wild type  and Δfur strains and the induced expression of ryhb in wt were generated to demonstrate the role of ryhb in mediating cps biosynthesis and iron acquisition systems.

RESULTS
fur directly represses ryhb expression in k. pneumoniae
to determine whether k. pneumoniae ryhb is regulated by fur, a lacz reporter system was used. the ryhb promoter was cloned into the upstream region of a promoterless lacz gene in placz <dig>  the resulting plasmid pryhb <dig> was then introduced into k. pneumoniae cg43s <dig> Δlacz and ΔlaczΔfur. the bacterial β-galactosidase activity was measured to assess the expression level of ryhb. as shown in figure 1a, the expression of ryhb was higher in ΔlaczΔfur than Δlacz. introduction of the complement plasmid pfur, but not the empty vector control , into ΔlaczΔfur restored the fur-deletion effect. moreover, addition of the iron chelator  <dig>  2-dipyridyl  to the growth medium increased ryhb promoter activity, suggesting that a fur-fe complex influences ryhb expression. to verify that fur directly regulates the expression of ryhb, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  was performed. as shown in figure 1b, purified recombinant his6-fur protein was able to bind the upstream region of ryhb , but not the pryhb* fragment, whose putative fur-box was deleted. in addition, the binding ability was abolished by the addition of  <dig> μm edta to the reaction mixture . furthermore, e. coli h <dig>  when harbouring a plasmid containing k. pneumoniae pryhb, also showed a fur titration assay -positive phenotype . the results suggest that, in an iron dependent manner, fur suppresses ryhb promoter activity in k. pneumoniae by direct interaction with the fur-box region upstream of ryhb.

ryhb activates cps biosynthesis
in k. pneumoniae cg <dig>  we found that the deletion of fur resulted in elevated cps production  <cit> . to investigate if ryhb participates in fur-regulated cps biosynthesis, the cps amount was assessed using measuring glucuronic acid content, which served as an indicator for klebsiella k <dig> cps  <cit> , in k. pneumoniae strains, including wt, Δryhb, Δfur, and ΔfurΔryhb, was quantified. as shown in figure 2a, although the deletion of ryhb alone did not change on the amount of k <dig> cps production, the elevated cps amount in Δfur cells was abolished by the deletion of ryhb when the bacteria were grown in lb medium. the result indicates that fur regulates the expression of ryhb to repress cps biosynthesis. to confirm the ryhb expression could activate the cps biosynthesis, the effect of ryhb induction on cps amount was determined using an iptg-inducible vector, petq. as shown in figure 2b, the induced expression of ryhb in k. pneumoniae cg <dig> increased cps production, which confirms that ryhb positively regulates cps biosynthesis.

ryhb increased the transcriptional level of the k <dig> cps gene cluster
to investigate whether ryhb affects the expression of the three cps gene clusters, the mrna levels of orf1orf <dig>  and orf <dig> in Δfur and ΔfurΔryhb strains were measured by quantitative real-time pcr . as shown in figure 3a, compared to the mrna levels in the Δfur strain, the mrna levels of orf <dig> and orf <dig> were apparent decreased in the ΔfurΔryhb strain, and that of orf <dig> also had a slight reduction in the ΔfurΔryhb strain. the result suggests that overexpression of ryhb activated the cps gene expression. to confirm our hypothesis, the effect of ryhb induction on the mrna levels of orf1orf <dig>  and orf <dig> was tested using an iptg-inducible vector, petq. as shown in figure 3b, the mrna levels of orf <dig> and orf <dig> were higher in the petq-ryhb strain with iptg induction than the petq mock strain, while no significant difference in orf <dig> expression was observed. to further investigate whether ryhb acts as a transcriptional activator for the promoter activity of orf1orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  the reporter plasmids porf <dig> , porf <dig> , and porf <dig> , each carrying a lacz reporter gene transcriptionally fused to the putative promoter region of the k <dig> cps gene cluster  <cit> , were used to transform the k. pneumoniae strains cg43s3ΔlaczΔfur and ΔlaczΔfurΔryhb. the promoter activity measurements shown in figure 3c revealed that the deletion of ryhb in ΔlaczΔfur reduced activity of porf1-2::lacz by at least 50%, while no obvious change was detected in the activity of porf3-16::lacz. the activity of porf16-17::lacz was reduced by more than 75% in ΔlaczΔfurΔryhb as compared to the ΔlaczΔfur strain. these results imply that ryhb enhances cps biosynthesis in k. pneumoniae by boosting the transcriptional level of the orf <dig> and orf <dig> gene clusters.

ryhb does not affect the rcsa, rmpa <dig>  and rmpa mrna expression level
in previous studies, k. pneumoniae fur was found to repress the expression of genes encoding the cps regulatory proteins rcsa, rmpa, and rmpa <dig>  <cit> . to investigate whether ryhb affects the expression of rcsarmpa, and rmpa <dig> to increase the orf <dig> and orf <dig> transcripts, the mrna levels were measured by qrt-pcr after inducing the expression of ryhb in wt. however, qrt-pcr results did not show a significant effect of ryhb on the mrna levels of rmparmpa <dig>  and rcsa , suggesting that the activation of ryhb on the orf <dig> and orf <dig> expression is not via rmpa, rmpa <dig>  and rcsa.

deletion of ryhb attenuated the higher serum resistance in Δfur strain
in addition to the roles played by ryhb and fur in regulating the cps amount, we suggest that ryhb and fur may also affect the ability of the strain to resist the bactericidal effects of serum. in a human serum resistance assay, we found that the deletion of fur in wt increased the survival rate in treatment with 75% normal human serum from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . however, the deletion of ryhb in wt had no apparent effect on the survival rate on treatment with 75% serum, and the higher serum resistance in Δfur cells was abolished by the deletion of ryhb. this result indicates that ryhb may participate with fur in regulating serum resistance in k. pneumoniae.

the regulatory role of ryhb in iron-acquisition systems
to assess whether ryhb affects iron-acquisition in k. pneumoniae, the chrome azurol s  assay was used to measure siderophore secretions in Δfur and ΔfurΔryhb strains . when bacteria were grown in m <dig> minimal medium  to mimic iron-limited condition, the deletion of ryhb in Δfur reduced the formation of the orange halo. however, this change was not observed when bacteria were grown in lb medium . compared to m <dig> minimal medium contains ~2 μm iron, lb medium is considered an iron-repletion medium. under iron-repletion, fur is able to exert its repression on ryhb transcription. thus, ryhb-deletion effect is difficult to observed under the growth condition that ryhb is poorly expressed. our results suggest that in the regulation of iron-acquisition systems, ryhb plays a role downstream of fur in k. pneumoniae under iron-limiting conditions.

to investigate the effects on downstream targets of ryhb in iron-acquisition regulons, the expression of genes corresponding to the eight putative iron-acquisition systems in k. pneumoniae cg <dig> was measured in Δfur and ΔfurΔryhb by qrt-pcr . in m <dig> minimal medium, the expression of genes  corresponding to three iron-acquisition systems  was decreased by half in the ΔfurΔryhb strain . however, the expression of fhua and sita was significantly increased more than two-fold . these results imply that ryhb activates the expression of iuca, fepa, fepb, entc, feca, and fece, but represses the expression of fhua and sita.

discussion
in this study, we provide an initial characterisation of k. pneumoniae ryhb. in k. pneumoniae, sequence comparison indicated that the nucleotide sequence of the ryhb gene  is  <dig> % identical to the e. coli version . however, the promoter sequence of k. pneumoniae ryhb is only  <dig> % identical to that of e. coli. in this study, we found that the expression of ryhb in k. pneumoniae is directly repressed by fur-fe, as is the case in e. coli .

in addition, structure of the genomic neighbourhood of ryhb differs between the  <dig> species. in the e. coli genome, ryhb is found between yhhx and yhhy. in the k. pneumoniae genome, ryhb is flanked by yhhy and a hypothetical orf. by pfam search, the hypothetical orf was found to contain a bactofilin domain , which belongs to a new class of polymer-forming proteins that serve as versatile molecular scaffolds in a variety of cellular pathways  <cit> . even though the function of this hypothetical protein in k. pneumoniae has not yet been investigated, we found that ryhb could strongly repress the expression of this hypothetical protein . this result suggests that ryhb could participate in a variety of cellular pathways in k. pneumoniae.

we previously showed in k. pneumoniae, fur represses cps biosynthesis via regulation of rmpa, rmpa <dig>  and rcsa. in addition to these  <dig> regulators, one or more regulators may be involved in the fur-mediated control of cps transcription  <cit> . in this study, we found that ryhb also participates in fur-regulated cps biosynthesis via activation of orf <dig> and orf <dig> transcription and is independent of the  <dig> regulators, rmpa, rmpa <dig>  and rcsa . we want to further analyse whether any potential transcriptional regulator-binding motifs exist in the promoter sequences of orf <dig> and orf <dig>  we noted that a binding site typical of iscr, a transcriptional repressor that controls fe–s biosynthesis  <cit> , was located 172 bp upstream of the translation start site of galf . the predication indicated that iscr could participate in control of orf <dig> expression. furthermore, a previous study reported that ryhb promotes the degradation of iscsua transcripts, resulting in an increase in the ratio of apo-iscr/holo-iscr  <cit> . whether ryhb activates cps biosynthesis via regulation of the ratio of apo-iscr/holo-iscr in k. pneumoniae awaits further analysis. however, the regulatory mechanism of cps transcription is more complex than expected; whether another unknown transcriptional regulator is involved in activation of ryhb’s effect on orf <dig> transcription needs to be investigated. in addition, cps is considered the major determinant that can protect the bacteria from phagocytosis and killing by serum factors  <cit> . in this study, higher serum resistance was found in Δfur, but this higher serum resistance was attenuated by further deletion of ryhb . we suggest the protective role of ryhb against serum killing is due to the activation of cps biosynthesis.

in e. coli, ryhb plays a positive role in control of the intracellular iron concentration via the degradation of nonessential iron-using proteins or an increase in siderophore production  <cit> . in this study, we also found the deletion of ryhb in Δfur decreased siderophore production on the cas plate under iron-limiting condition . consistent with e. coli  <cit> , ryhb in k. pneumoniae regulates siderophore production by activating the expression of enterobactin system genes . in addition, we found that ryhb may activate iuca and feca expression. since srna may positively regulate its target mrnas via an anti-antisense mechanism to disrupt an intrinsic inhibitory structure in the 5′ mrna region that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and the first translation codon  <cit> , the 5′-untranslated regions of the iuc and fec operons were analysed for sequences complementary to ryhb by prediction with the bioinformatics application rnahybrid  <cit>  . however, no apparent base pairing was found in the 5′-untranslated region of the iuc or fec operons, suggesting that the activation of iuca and feca by ryhb is not a result of direct interaction. furthermore, ryhb was found to repress the expression of fhua and sita in k. pneumoniae. in e. coli, ryhb represses the expression of fhua, which also corresponds to our results  <cit> . a possible paring between ryhb with the adjacent sequence of translational start site of fhua and sita was also predicted by the rnahybrid algorithm. alignment of the protected residues predicts that ryhb forms a 7 + 4 + 4 bp rna duplex with the sita mrna , but no apparent base pairing was found between ryhb and fhua. however, the direct interaction of ryhb with the sita mrna remains to be confirmed. in e. coli, ryhb has been shown to repress several genes that are involved in iron-binding, which may increase the intracellular iron concentration, thereby allowing a better usage of iron and more complete fur repression of these genes  <cit> . nevertheless, this possibility in k. pneumoniae needs to be proven by careful experiments. in this study, the coordinated action of fur and ryhb was found to regulate the expression of the iron acquisition systems for maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis in k. pneumoniae.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we provide an initial characterisation of k. pneumoniae ryhb. our results suggest that ryhb plays an important role in the fur regulon, which modulates the cps biosynthesis and iron acquisition systems in k. pneumoniae, both of which contribute to the infectivity and survival of the bacterium.
