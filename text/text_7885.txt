BACKGROUND
the endoderm gives rise to the respiratory and digestive organs such as pancreas, liver, lung, stomach, and intestine. these developmental processes are of great importance in therapeutics. the multipotent endoderm has the potential to be used to repair tissues. however, in spite of the importance of the definitive endoderm  derived tissues, not much is known about how they emerge from the primary gut tube. fate mapping studies suggest that the fate of the de begins to segregate at embryonic day 6- <dig>   and that the progenitors that are fated to become specific tissues of the gut tube appear shortly after the completion of gastrulation  <cit> . the expression of the regional specific transcription factors has provided clues to how the endoderm is patterned into organ domains. in the chick, the progenitor for stomach, pancreas and intestine are segregated immediately after the completion of gastrulation. the progenitors receive inducing signals from the adjacent mesoderm during their migration and are specified before they reach their final destination  <cit> . pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene  <dig>  expression is by far the first sign of pancreatic differentiation detected at e <dig>  in dorsal endoderm of the gut. pdx <dig> is expressed before the buds become evident, and is required for the progression of pancreatic and rostral duodenal development  <cit> . genetic lineage tracing studies have shown that the pdx1-expressing cells give rise to all three cell lineages in the pancreas, the endocrine, exocrine and duct cells.

recent advances in analysis and identification of early endodermal or pancreatic genes is remarkable  <cit> . several reports have demonstrated the identification of novel endodermal genes using early embryos. embryonic stem  cells are also a highly useful tool in the study of endodermal development. es cells are pluripotent cells and can be cultured indefinitely in an undifferentiated state, and stimulated to differentiate into various cell types. progress in es cell studies has demonstrated that es cells provide a good system for studies of developmental biology, in addition to the use of es cells as a surrogate cell source for regenerative medicine. several groups have reported the differentiation of mouse or human es cells into the de or pancreatic lineages  <cit> . we recently established a procedure, where es cells were cultured on a monolayer of mesodermal-derived m <dig> cells, and sequentially induced into the mesendoderm, de and regional specific de-derived organs in vitro. this occurred in a manner that mimics early embryonic inductive events in vivo  <cit> . with the addition of activin and bfgf, mouse es cells differentiated into pdx1-expressing cells efficiently, reaching 60% of the de  <cit> . this m <dig> procedure turned out not only to be useful in directing de lineages, but also the ectoderm and mesoderm lineages from es cells, by altering the culture conditions  <cit> . using this m <dig> differentiation procedure, we tried to validate the differentiated cells by analyzing the expression profiles of three germ layer cells and the pancreatic progenitor cells  <cit> . comparison of the expression profiles between the cells of the three germ layers, which are derived from the es cells based on this m <dig> procedure, revealed a clear distinct clustering of the genes specifically expressed in each germ layer. studies of pdx1-exprssing cells derived from es cells led to the discovery of a novel pancreatic progenitor marker, eppk <dig>  <cit>  and identification of a novel surface marker, daf1/cd <dig>  expressed in the de  <cit> . therefore, it is feasible to identify genes related to early de development and pancreatic differentiation by close investigation into the es cell-derived cells.

here we describe an extensive gene expression profile analysis of es cell-derived definitive endodermal cells and pdx1-expressing cells. we chose candidate genes by the comparisons between es cell-derived pdx1-positive or negative de with the undifferentiated es cells, es cell-derived ectoderm, mesendoderm and mesoderm cells. then we carried out whole mount or section in situ hybridization using mouse embryos at e <dig>  or pancreas at e <dig> , respectively. out of  <dig> candidate genes examined,  <dig> candidate genes are expressed in the de at e <dig>  and  <dig> genes are expressed in the pancreatic bud at e <dig> . these results indicate that the es cell-derived differentiated cells serve as good models for studies of candidate genes during early embryogenesis.

RESULTS
microarray analysis of es cell-derived de cell lineages
as previously described, we developed an efficient procedure using mesodermal-derived m <dig> cells as feeder cells with the supplementation of activin and bfgf, to sequentially differentiate es cells into, mesendoderm  at day  <dig> , de   and then pdx1-expressing cells ,   <cit> . es cells were also differentiated into the three germ layers under different conditions . using these procedures, es cell-derived differentiated cells of the ectoderm  , mes , lateral plate mesoderm  , paraxial mesoderm   and de at d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> were prospectively isolated, by the expression of specific cell surface antigens using flow cytometry. de cells at d <dig> were further subdivided into pdx1/gfp-negative and -positive populations. the efficiencies of the induction of individual populations were similar to that previously reported . the values were as follows: mes , lpm , pam , d5de , d5ect , d7de , d8de , and d8de pdx <dig> , or d8de pdx1+ . since ect was done by negative selection, we confirmed the purity of the ect using a sox1/gfp es cell line  <cit> . ninety-four percent of the sorted ect turned out to be sox1/gfp-positive neuroectoderm. rna was extracted from these cells and analyzed by affymetrix dna microarray. then, gene expression profiles of undifferentiated es cells , es cell-derived ect, lpm, pam, mes, d5de, d7de, pdx1- d8de and pdx1+ d8de, were compared. a remarkable transition of the gene expression profile was observed from d5de to d7de and thereafter .

to validate the microarray results, we selected six representative genes, which showed increased expression levels at > <dig> fold changes in d8de, compared to the median signal intensities of other populations, namely es, ect, lpm, pam, mes and d5de. we examined the actual expression patterns of these genes in es cell-derived cells. figure 1c shows the signal intensities of  <dig> genes: ai <dig>  akr1c <dig>  foxp <dig>  hipk <dig>  pcbd <dig> and tmem184a, together with those of sox <dig>  an endodermal gene, and pdx <dig>  in each indicated population of es cell-derived cells obtained in the microarray . then, transcription levels of the above genes were quantified by real time pcr analysis . the patterns of the quantitative pcr results correlated well with the signal intensities obtained in the microarray analyses . the high expression level of sox  <dig> in d5de, d7de and pdx <dig> in d8de pdx1+ population, further confirmed the characters of the es cell-derived cell populations.

identification of de specific genes in es cell-differentiation
to identify genes involved in de and pancreatic development, we chose genes that showed raw expression levels above  <dig> and increased expression in d5de or d8de pdx1+ more than  <dig> fold change compared to the median signal intensity of es, ect, lpm, pam, mes, d5de and d8de pdx1+. as a result,  <dig> probe sets  or  <dig> probe sets  showed increased transcripts at d5de and d8de pdx1+, respectively, with  <dig> probe sets  overlapping between the two populations. thus,  <dig> probe sets  were specifically up regulated at d5de, and decreased thereafter. one hundred and fifteen probe sets  were up regulated through d5de to d8de pdx1+. six hundred and sixty-five probe sets  were up regulated at d8de pdx1+.

we then examined the expression pattern of some of these de specific genes in early stages of development. unknown genes, or genes with specific domain structures, transcription factors or genes whose expression in the endoderm or early pancreas development have not been described, were chosen and analyzed by whole mount in situ hybridization. figure  <dig> shows the summary of the numbers of genes analyzed and the genes, which were positive in the expression in the gut endoderm at embryonic day  e <dig>   and/or the pancreatic bud at e <dig>  . of the  <dig> probe sets  that were up regulated at > <dig> fold at d <dig> & d8de pdx1+,  <dig> genes were picked,  <dig> genes were expressed in the e <dig>  gut epithelium, and  <dig> genes were expressed in e <dig>  pancreas bud . of the  <dig> probe sets  that were up regulated at > <dig> fold at d8de,  <dig> genes were examined,  <dig> genes were expressed in the e <dig>  gut epithelium, and  <dig> genes were expressed in the e <dig>  pancreatic bud. additionally, we randomly picked  <dig> genes whose expression increased at d7de at >  <dig> fold compared to d5de, and  <dig> genes that were expressed at d8de in the pdx1+ population at > <dig> fold compared to the pdx1- population. of the genes examined,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were expressed in the e <dig>  gut epithelium, respectively, and  <dig>  genes were expressed in e <dig>  pancreas bud .

genes up regulated in es cell-derived de cells are also expressed in the gut endoderm at e <dig> 
as shown in figure  <dig>  out of  <dig> genes examined, the expression of  <dig> genes, which increased at > <dig> fold at d5de through d8de, were expressed in e <dig>  or e <dig>  endoderm. the  <dig> positive genes were: ai <dig>  akr1c <dig>  daf1/cd <dig>  foxq <dig>  nptx <dig>  pga <dig>  parm <dig> and tmem184a. their expression patterns at e <dig>  are shown in figure  <dig>  ai <dig> and nptx <dig> were expressed in the whole gut endoderm throughout the anterior-to-posterior region . akr1c <dig> was expressed weakly in the anterior intestinal portal  at e <dig> , and in the liver bud, pancreas and intestine epithelium at e <dig>  . daf1/cd <dig> expression is observed in the lateral gut and aip at e <dig> , which was published earlier  <cit>  . similarly, tmem184a was expressed in the lateral gut and aip at e <dig> . foxq <dig> was expressed strongly in the aip. parm <dig> was expressed in the dorsal anterior gut epithelium. pga <dig> was expressed weakly in the whole lateral gut epithelium. the regions positively detected by in situ hybridization are marked by arrows . cross sections were made and representative results of parm <dig> and tmem184a expressions are shown .

all genes up regulated > <dig> folds in d5de, d7de or d8de, and their expressions are observed in e <dig>  endoderm or e <dig>  pancreatic buds are listed. descriptions, genbank number, expression patterns in e <dig>  endoderm, e <dig>  pancreatic buds, and previous publications are summarized.

the expression patterns by in situ hybridization in e <dig>   of  <dig> positive genes, whose expression increased first at d8de are shown in figure 4a. apoe was expressed in the lateral endoderm and visceral endoderm at e <dig>   and strongly in the liver bud at e <dig>  . most genes, including chi3l <dig>  cpm, c2cd4b, fam184b, fhl <dig>  foxp <dig>  hipk <dig>  lbh, pcbd <dig>  pbxip <dig>  sox <dig>  tcf7l <dig> and zmiz <dig>  were expressed in the anterior intestinal portal  in e <dig>  embryos . in addition to the aip, c2cd4b was also expressed in the hindgut; cpm, foxp <dig> and zmiz were also expressed in the lateral gut epithelium. irf <dig> was expressed in the anterior endoderm and hindgut epithelium. the lateral gut epithelium expression of zmiz <dig> was shown by sectioning the e <dig>  embryo after in situ hybridization . an ig domain gene, palld <dig>  was expressed in the dorsal gut epithelium, also confirmed by sectioning the e <dig>  embryo after in situ hybridization .

the followings are the expression patterns of the genes that were up regulated at d7de or d8de, at > <dig> fold compared to d5de  or at a > <dig> fold increase in pdx1+ versus pdx1- population : among the  <dig> genes examined , aebp <dig>  barhl and kiss1r were expressed in e <dig>  embryos. aebp <dig> was strongly expressed in the whole gut tube, and barhl <dig>  kiss1r in the lateral gut epithelium .

all genes described in figure  <dig> and  <dig> are summarized in table  <dig>  with their gene descriptions, genbank number, expression patterns in e <dig>  endoderm, and previous publications on expression or function in the endoderm or pancreas. although they have been implicated in the function of pancreas or other endodermal derived organs, this study showed, for the first time, the expression of many genes in the early stage of development.

genes expressed in distinct pancreas domains at e <dig> 
as described above, of the  <dig> genes analyzed,  <dig> genes were expressed in the e <dig>  gut epithelium . it was reported that transcripts of genes could be categorized based on their expression patterns into one of five expression domain in the pancreas at e <dig>   <cit> . we then examined all  <dig> genes for their expression in e <dig>  pancreatic buds. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes are expressed in e <dig>  pancreatic buds. the expression patterns were categorized . aebp <dig>  ai <dig>  akr1c <dig>  creb3l <dig>  foxp <dig>  hipk <dig>  pcbd <dig>  sox <dig>  tcf7l <dig> and tmem184a were expressed in the pancreas epithelium . pbxip <dig> and c2cd4b were expressed in the trunk region . parm <dig> and pcdh <dig> were expressed in the tip region . ai <dig>  creb3l <dig> and tcf7l <dig> were also expressed in the mesenchyme, in addition to their epithelial expressions . pcdh <dig> was expressed only in the mesenchyme . apoe was expressed in the vascular cells . the above gene expression domains in e <dig>  pancreatic buds are summarized in table  <dig> 

coexpression of the genes with endocrine and exocrine markers in the pancreatic bud
to investigate further into the function of the genes, their co-expression with the endocrine markers, namely insulin and glucagon, or an exocrine marker, amylase, and pdx <dig> were examined.

c2cd4b, a gene expressed in the trunk , was co-expressed with insulin, but not glucagon, implicating its function in endocrine β cell differentiation . hipk <dig> was co-expressed with glucagon, but not insulin, implicating that it might associate with α cell differentiation . akr1c <dig> was co-expressed with pdx <dig> or insulin, thus suggesting its possible function in β cell differentiation . foxp <dig>  pcbd <dig> and aebp <dig>  which are expressed in the epithelium, were co-localized in part with amylase staining .

discussion
we previously reported the prospective isolation and global expression profiles of the es cells derived three germ layer cells, such as the mesendoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm and de, which were obtained by culturing es cells on m <dig>  <cit> . therefore, m <dig> provides a platform to compare expression profiles of different lineages derived from es cells.

in our previous analyses, without the addition of activin and bfgf, but with m <dig> feeder cells, es cells derived into immature de cells, and there were few genes that were expressed in e <dig>  pancreatic buds  <cit> . here, we used a differentiation protocol with the supplementation of activin and bfgf, a procedure that allows for approximately 50-60% of the differentiated es cells to give rise to the de, and among which 60% cells give rise to pdx1-expressing cells  <cit> . under the present protocol, es cells differentiated into a pancreatic developmental pathway. many genes expressed specifically in the pancreas are identified by comparing d7de or d8de with other populations. this may explain the reason for the small differences between gfp+ and gfp- population, since gfp- population are committed to a similar developmental pathway. using this protocol, we efficiently identified genes specifically expressed in the de and the pancreatic lineage.

we also examined in our es cell-derived cells, the expression levels of genes enriched the e <dig>  embryo endoderm   <cit> , e <dig>  endoderm   <cit> , and e <dig>  pdx1+ cells   <cit> . many of the enriched genes in de of e <dig>  embryos were also found to be up-regulated in our es cell-derived d5de, d7de and d8de gfp+ cells . of the endoderm enriched genes in e <dig>  embryos, genes such as spink <dig>  clic <dig>  foxa <dig>  krt <dig>  crb <dig>  ell <dig>  rab <dig> rbm35a, st <dig> and tmprss <dig> are expressed at a higher level in d7de or d8de than d5de. a limited number of e <dig>  pdx1+ cells enriched genes, such as mest, peg <dig>  col1a <dig>  tnc, capn, gap <dig> and meis <dig>  were up regulated in the d8de gfp+ cells. these results therefore suggest that gene expression profiles in d <dig>  d <dig> and d8de were similar with that of e <dig>  embryonic de. however, d <dig> and d8de resembled e <dig>  embryonic de compared to d5de, whereas d8de resembled e <dig>  embryonic pdx1+ cells compared to the other populations.

genes expressed in endodermal tissues other than the pancreas
among the genes whose expression is increased in the es cell-derived de population, several genes are found to be expressed in the foregut, hindgut or whole gut. there are genes previously reported to be expressed in the gut endoderm, or genes with some aspects related to pancreas endocrine or exocrine functions.

foxq <dig>  a fork-head transcription factor, was previously described to be specifically expressed in the stomach in developing and adult gastrointestinal tract. mice carrying foxq <dig> mutations show absence of mrna and protein of the major stomach mucin muc5ac, and the mutant mice show a paucity of foveolar cell secretory vesicles and a notable loss of stomach mucus  <cit> .

cpm, carboxypeptidase m, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol -anchored membrane protein with b-type carboxypeptidase activity and is a member of the 'regulatory' or carboxypeptidase n/e subfamily of metallocarboxypeptidases. cpm expression has been described in the developing and adult lung in alveolar type i cells  <cit> . recently, the expression of cpm was described to be one of the genes expressed in the foxa2-expressing endoderm cells  <cit> .

foxp <dig>  a member of the forkhead box family of winged-helix genes, is described to be expressed in the pulmonary, neural and gut tissues during embryonic development  <cit> . it was recently reported to mediate transcriptional repression, by interaction with a component of nurd, and regulate gene expression and epithelial injury response in the lung via regulation of interleukin- <dig>  <cit> .

pcdh <dig>  protocadherin- <dig>  is a member of the δ-protocadherin subgroup of non-clustered protocadherins. the expression is described to be especially prominent in blood vessels in organs derived from the embryonic gut, such as the esophagus, intestines, liver, lung, and submandibular glands  <cit> .

zmiz <dig>  also known as zmip <dig>  is a member of pias  family of genes. like the other members of this family, zmiz <dig> contains the zinc-binding sp-ring zn-finger domain, which confers sumo-conjugating activity. at e <dig>  zmiz <dig> transcripts were generally observed in the epiblast, and expression was detected in the neuroectoderm, dorsal aorta and foregut at e <dig>   <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that genes up regulated in the es cell-derived de at d <dig> and later, or genes up regulated at d <dig>  are good candidates for being expressed in the gut endoderm at e <dig>  during early embryogenesis. therefore, es cell-derived de resembles normal early embryos, and serves as a good source for providing cells for studies on development.

genes expressed in the pancreas
since the differentiation procedure for de at d <dig> or d <dig> is in favor of pancreatic differentiation, there turned out to be many genes expressed in the pancreatic bud. parm <dig>  riken cdna 9130213b <dig>  is one of the top ranked  <dig> genes whose expression is decreased in pdx <dig> mutant mice in the e <dig>  dorsal pancreatic bud  <cit> . tmem <dig>  also described as sdmg <dig>  is a component of secretory granules in mouse secretory exocrine tissues, such as pancreas, salivary gland, and mammary gland. its expression in the developing pancreas was recently reported  <cit> . homeodomain-interacting protein kinas - <dig>  is expressed in the embryonic and adult pancreas and positively regulates pdx <dig> transcriptional activity by directly phosphorylating the c-terminal portion of pdx <dig>  <cit> . nptx <dig> is one of genes reported with aberrant dna methylation in familial pancreatic cancers  <cit> .

tcf7l <dig>  also known as tcf- <dig>  is a component of the canonical wnt signaling pathway. a strong genetic association relationship between tcf7l <dig> polymorphisms and type  <dig> diabetes mellitus was identified  <cit> . tcf7l <dig> was shown to be involved in stimulating the proliferation of pancreatic β-cells and the production of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide- <dig> in intestinal endocrine l cells  <cit> . silencing of tcf7l <dig> in human and mouse islets results in a decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increased beta cell apoptosis  <cit> .

similarly, variants at c2cd4b loci are associated with reduced glucose-stimulated β cell function  <cit> . sox <dig>  a gene of a member of the homeodomain and basic helix-loop-helix families of transcription factors, is expressed in developing mouse pancreas  <cit> . sox <dig> reportedly has a role in insulin secretion in the adult β-cell downstream of the katp channel, and is identified as a risk factor for diabetes and obesity  <cit> . kiss1r, also known as gpr <dig>  is expressed in the islets and in β  and α  cell lines  <cit> . kisspeptin, a novel peptide as endogenous ligand of kiss1r, plays a crucial role in puberty and reproductive function  <cit> , and potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets  <cit> .

most genes listed here are revealed for the first time to be expressed at this early stage of e <dig>  and e <dig> . it is of interest that genes responsible for β-cell maturation are expressed at early stages of development. future works examining their function would reveal their role in replication or differentiation of the pancreas. these results again highlight the usefulness of the es cell-derived cells for the discovering of genes that have a role in the development and function of the pancreas.

genes found for the first time to be expressed in the definitive endoderm or pancreas
there are genes that have never reported to be expressed in the de or the pancreas. akr1c <dig> is an aldo-keto reductase family  <dig> member c <dig>  <cit> . aebp <dig> encodes a zinc finger protein that has been shown to interact with the mammalian polycomb repression complex <dig>   <cit> . its drosophila homolog, jing, is a zinc-finger transcription factor that interacts with the fly polycomb group  protein complexes, and plays an essential role in controlling cns midline and tracheal cell differentiation  <cit> . pbxip <dig> is a pbx interacting protein, also known as hpip, inhibits the binding of pbx1-hox complexes to dna  <cit> . creb3l <dig>  also known as oasis, is a zip  transcription factor, which is a member of the creb/atf family, has a transmembrane domain, and has been identified as an er stress transducer  <cit> . the physiological functions of these genes in normal pancreatic development remain to be explored.

finally, there are genes whose expression we could not detect in the pdx1+ cells during normal pancreatic development. this might be due to their low expression levels and/or technical limitation. in addition, some of the genes show expression patterns that are difficult to be catalogued at e <dig> , since the pancreatic differentiation undergoes a secondary transition at this stage and many genes show a dramatic change in their expression patterns after the secondary transition.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data show that es cell in vitro differentiation is an excellent model system for studies of early developmental processes. es cell-derived de cells or pdx1/gfp-expressing cells obtained from m <dig> based differentiation procedure mimic cells of the normal developmental processes. markers identified will be useful for the elucidation of the pancreatic development. this data will also help to derive cells from es cells that are useful for therapeutics.
