BACKGROUND
an escalating magnitude of drug resistance among bacterial pathogens has been installing a serious threat on the public health and economy of the developed world. a survey report has suggested that the direct cost to us economy alone due to drug resistant bacterial infection is around $4-$ <dig> billion annually  <cit> . even for pharmaceuticals companies, it turns out to be a heart-dying situation that after investing ~$ <dig> million and about  <dig> years of atrocious labor to introduce a drug in the market, the pathogens already attains resistance against the drug. therefore, there is an urgent need to recognize new inhibitors against novel and/or known targets. undoubtedly, well-established bacterial targets i.e. cell wall and membrane biosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, nucleic acid etc always the first choice for developing antibacterials. the recent trend in this direction indicates that researchers are looking for novel targets alongside to discover new classes of inhibitors/antibiotics.

the amino acids biosynthetic pathways specifically lysine pathway has gained special attention because of its potential role in bacterial cell wall and protein synthesis  <cit> . the d, l-diaminopimelic acid , an important intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of lysine is crucial in cross-linking peptidoglycan chains to provide strength and rigidity to the bacterial cell wall . the absence of this pathway in mammalian system suggests that specific inhibitors of this biosynthetic pathway may be a valuable for developing novel classes of antibacterial agents. in this study, we explored dhdps enzyme of the pathway, which catalysis condensation of pyruvate and aspartate semialdehyde to form dhdp. figure  <dig> shows the established dap pathway for dap and lysine biosynthesis. the enzyme is encoded by dapa gene, which has been cloned and expressed from several strains, including thermatoga maritima, corynebacterium glutamicum, mycobacterium tuberculosis and bacillus anthracis. the three-dimensional structures of dhdps enzyme from escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, m. tuberculosis and b. anthracis enzymes with substrate pyruvate and without have been reported  <cit> .

the antibacterial identification using experimental techniques is invariably very expensive, requires extensive pains and labor. therefore, in silico techniques, which have the power to cut down these unavoidable steps, would be valuable. in recent years, in silico techniques like quantitative structure activity relationship  and molecular docking are gaining high popularity in the drug discovery  <cit> . both these methodologies allow the identification of probable lead candidates expeditiously prior to chemical synthesis and characterization, thereby, making the process more cost effective  <cit> .

in the present study, we attempt to integrate power of two in silico potential techniques: qsar and molecular docking by using docking generated energy-based descriptors for building qsar models. using this strategy, the information regarding binding mode of ligands in the active site is accumulated which would in turn assist the accurate prediction of better inhibitor with improved ki values. to facilitate this we also developed a web-interface to help experimentalist working in the field of designing novel inhibitors against dhdps enzyme.

RESULTS
for the docking of  <dig> inhibitors, e. coli dhdps crystal structure stored in the pdb file 1yxd was retrieved. the crystal structure of dhdps consisted of two similar chains  with inhibitor bound at allosteric site  <cit> . the water molecules and inhibitor were removed using pymol software and chain a was considered for the docking purpose. the python scripts were used for carrying out automated flexible docking of  <dig> inhibitors on the predefined and experimentally characterized binding pocket, where the residue lys <dig> being particularly very important. hence, it's important to consider the flexibility of lys <dig> and the inhibitors, while performing docking. figure  <dig> shows the docking of two inhibitors: inh- <dig>  and inh- <dig>  at the active site of dhdps enzyme. in order to validate our docking methodology another crystal structure of e. coli dhdps  with substrate bound at the active site was obtained from pdb. the enzyme 1yxd could not be used as it enclosed bound conformation of an allosteric inhibitor -lysine. since crystals were remarkably similar , therefore, the same procedure for the docking of pyruvate was adopted which resulted in very slight variation in the rmsd value of  <dig>  Å. hence, the docking protocol adopted in the present study was able to reproduce the conformation comparable to the crystal structure with substrate at active site. additionally, analysis of  <dig> docked poses of substrate generated by autodock software was also carried out. in additional file 1: table s <dig> we have shown the values of free binding energies and rmsds in the inreasing order of ranking. it was observed that rmsd value for the fifth ranked pose was lesser in comparison with the pose with best and minimum free binding energy. we also calculated the pair-wise corelation between free binding energy and rmsd, resulted in r value of  <dig> , which reveals that there exists correlation between free binding energy and rmsd values, however not the ideal or perfect one. therefore, it's not always true that the pose with the lowest binding energy is the one with the lowest rmsd to the crystal structure. ofcourse, one can validate or check the rmsd values for a single ligand system with bound crystal structure known. however, during virtual screening procedure with large number of unknown structures to dock, it's practically impossible to obtain the rmsd values. therefore, in such cases, it has been shown in the past that the compounds with the lowest binding energies are generally considered as potential hits.

it's important to mention that in general, after docking, autodock computes  <dig> types of energy values i.e. - i) estimated free energy of binding ; ii) final intermolecular energy , which is the sum of  <dig> energies such as  vdw + hbond + desolv energy ,  electrostatic energy ,  moving ligand-fixed receptor , and  moving ligand-moving receptor ; vii) final total internal energy , again the sum of  <dig> energy values such as  internal energy ligand , and  internal energy receptor ;  torsional free energy  and  unbound system's energy . finally,  <dig> types of energy values based descriptors were then used as independent variables for qsar modeling.

to obtain significant and non-correlated variables from the above-mentioned  <dig> descriptors, a statistical package, statistica, was used. indeed all the descriptors were highly significant, showing the p <  <dig> . to filter out correlated descriptors, pair-wise correlation coefficient at the cut-off value of  <dig>  was imposed. the two variables namely eunb and eintl yielded the pair-wise correlation values >  <dig>  with eftot and therefore filtered out from the further analysis .

using mlr, a qsar based model was generated using  <dig> variables namely, efreebind, eelec, eintr, and etors which accomplished correlation  values of  <dig> / <dig>  with mae of  <dig>  . though model was able to obtain good correlation values however, q <dig> value was observed to be very low . next, svm along with f-stepping variable selection approach was employed. during first cycle of f-stepping remove-one, an elimination of fifth descriptor i.e. emlfr from the set of n =  <dig> and the development of svm model using  <dig> remaining variables attained the best correlation r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>   listed in table  <dig>  for the second cycle, the removal of 9th descriptor i.e. eintr further improved the correlation value to  <dig> / <dig>  showing reduction in mae to  <dig>  . the next cycle however did not enhance the correlation values significantly as exclusion of emlmr offered correlation values  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>   therefore, making its absence or presence to elicit no influence on correlation values. the correlation between predicted and actual activity values is shown in figure  <dig>  in the subsequent cycles of variables selection, no improvement in correlation values was observed. therefore, it can be deduced that  <dig> descriptors i.e. efreebind, eintermol, evhd, eelec, eftot and etors are important to predict the inhibitory activity values for the present dataset of  <dig> inhibitors against dhdps. further, an external cross-validation was carried out by randomly dividing  <dig> inhibitors dataset into three different sizes of training and test sets such as  <dig> and 2;  <dig> and 4;  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the highest correlation q2/r <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>   was obtained for the largest training and smallest test sets of  <dig> and  <dig> inhibitors . an increase in the size of test set with corresponding decrease in training set size reduced the r <dig> values along with slight reduction in q <dig> values. the notion behind this splitting was to appraise a high predictive correlation values on the test set even when the size of training set was very low.

besides, pair-wise correlation coefficient values listed in table  <dig> between ki and energy-based descriptors for  <dig> inhibitors were calculated. surprisingly, three descriptors such as efreebind, eintermol, and evhd from the finally selected  <dig> energy-based descriptors  showed high fluctuations with respect to ki values , which in turn have higher pair-wise correlation coefficient values . on the other hand, the variables i.e. eftot and etors observed to be neutral, indeed provided low correlation values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the emlfr, which showed high correlation value of  <dig>  with ki, was removed in the first cycle of variables selection. these deviations prompted us to carry out the clustering of the dataset of  <dig> inhibitors using jchem software http://www.chemaxon.com/. as shown in figure  <dig>  all  <dig> inhibitors clustered into two unique groups however, three compounds inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig> were variable. hence, to filter the noise that might be caused due to these  <dig> inhibitors, a qsar model was again generated removing these  <dig> structures. using f-stepping variable selection approach,  <dig> energy-based input variables i.e. efreebind, eintermol, evhd, eintl and emlfr generated a qsar model attaining correlation r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>  .

additionally, qsar modeling was also carried out using six non-correlated descriptors i.e. efreebind, eelec, eftot, eintr, emlmr and etors having pair-wise correlation value less than  <dig> . using mlr, the qsar model was developed with four types of input variables- efreebind, emlmr, eintr, and etors, which accomplished correlation  values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>  . hence, a small increase in correlation values in comparison to earlier mlr model , was observed. further, svm model was trained using six descriptors but the model attained poor correlation  values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>   signifying the presence of some descriptors ideally may not required for robust model generation. thus, employing the f-stepping variable selection approach, the removal emlmr from the set of n =  <dig> energy-based descriptors and using the  <dig> remaining descriptors for the svm model development achieved best correlation r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>   . next, filtering of etors enhanced the correlation  value of model to  <dig> / <dig>  with reduction in mae to  <dig>  . then, qsar modeling was carried out on the remaining four descriptors and the removal of eftot augmented the correlation value to  <dig> / <dig>  with attenuation of mae value to  <dig> , a noteworthy enhancement. the correlation between predicted activities for the inhibitors and their actual experimental values is depicted in figure 8a. there exists a good agreement between predicted and experimental activity values hence suggesting the robustness of qsar model. therefore, the three energy-based descriptors such efreebind, eelec, and eintr were imperative to predict the inhibitory activity values. interestingly, the performance of three descriptor based qsar model was found to be better in comparison to the six descriptors based svm model  which was described earlier using cut-off value of  <dig> . additionally, the removal of three outliers like inh- <dig>  inh- <dig> and inh- <dig>  further enhanced the prediction efficiency of qsar model by increasing the correlation  values to  <dig> / <dig>  and reduction in mae to  <dig>  . further, high external training/testing cross-validated correlation values  in the range of  <dig> - <dig> / <dig> - <dig>  was attained by randomly splitting the dataset into several training sets for model building and independent testing on corresponding test sets .

in order to assess robustness and validation of the finally developed three descriptors based qsar model, a bootstrap analysis for  <dig> runs by statistical sampling of the original dataset was also performed which yielded a higher q2bootstap value of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . thus, higher and lower values of q2bootstap and standard deviation parameters comprehensively support the statistical validity of the presently developed qsar models. further, y-randomization test was also carried out using shuffled activity dataset which resulted in poor performance i.e. nearly all of the q <dig> values were < zero , thereby signifying the consistency of qsar model.

2d descriptors based qsar modeling
to compare the performance of three energy-based qsar model with simple 2d qsar models, the 2d qsar modeling with  <dig> non-correlated descriptors was also performed. the study was commenced by mlr modeling, which tried to establish structure-activity relationship using five descriptors i.e. msd, pji <dig>  jhetm, alogp <dig>  and me by attaining correlation r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>  . the performance of 2d descriptors based model was found to be lower in comparison with four energy-based mlr model described earlier . further, using all  <dig> non-correlated descriptors for the training of svm model, a very poor correlation  value of  <dig>  was observed. the removal of  <dig> descriptors: nbm, bli, jhetm, gats1v, nhacc, alogp and mats <dig> m  and the training of svm model with remaining  <dig> descriptors attained r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>  . during the next cycle, an exclusion of jgi <dig>  optimized the svm model  by achieving correlation r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig> . in the next cycle, the removal of nh  descriptor improved the correlation value to  <dig> / <dig>  with reduction in mae value to  <dig>  . finally, elimination of me constitutional descriptor and the development of qsar model on the remaining  <dig> descriptors, which included two topological descriptors-msd, pji <dig>  molecular property-alogp <dig> and burden eigenvalues descriptor-behm <dig>  yielded correlation r/q <dig> values of  <dig> / <dig>  and mae of  <dig>  . hence, the performance of svm based 2d qsar model was found to be very low in comparison with three energy values based qsar model developed using svm.

implementation of webserver
we attempted to develop efficient qsar model and based on these models, a web server "kidoq"  using cgi-perl and python scripts was developed. user can draw the structure of ligand molecule using jme editor incorporated on the server. the server also accepts input as mol/mol <dig> structure files pasted or uploaded on the server . the working flow of kidoq server is shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
the qsar modeling has been accepted as a promising methodology for lead identification. nevertheless, if high-resolution target structure is available, then receptor structure based approach is often a first choice. the recent studies have shown the better performance of qsar models even in the presence of target structure. however, simple qsar approach can sometimes lead to false prediction if the collected data does not cover the complete property space or the selected 2d/3d descriptors are not reliable. therefore, both techniques have their own advantages and limitations  <cit> . keeping in view, the importance of docking and better performance of qsar, we integrated both approaches by using docking generated energy-based scores as descriptors for qsar modeling. the major benefit presumed by this integration would be an additional validation of the docking predicted inhibitors as bioactive or inactive by prediction of their bioactivity values using qsar models henceforth, would facilitate in reduction of false positives.

in the present study, docking of the  <dig> experimentally known inhibitors of dhdps at its active binding site resulted in  <dig> energy-based descriptors. for valid statistical results, it was imperative to restrict the maximal number of descriptors or to remove highly correlated ones, as presence of redundancy reduced the discriminating power of input variables, thereby reducing their worth in model development. ideally, a regression model with n training set compounds and k descriptors may be acceptable only if n > 4k and for any of the k descriptors- i) the significance level p is <  <dig> ; ii) the pair-wise correlation coefficient should be <  <dig>   <cit> . therefore, we also looked for statistically significant and non-correlated energy-based descriptors. all  <dig> types of energy-based descriptors were statistically significant but only  <dig> and  <dig> variables showed pair-wise correlation value >  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, resulting their removal necessary for rigorous qsar modeling. as qsar modeling for dhdps enzyme's inhibitors is being carried out for the first time, therefore both linear  and non-linear  techniques were employed. in our study, the performance of svm model was found to be much better in comparison with mlr model. the simple linear model was unable to handle the diversity of the present dataset; therefore, the cases where simple linear techniques fail, non-linear techniques could provide a better option.

further, it was also noticed that the structural diversity of  <dig> inhibitors and redundancy among finally selected six descriptors resulted in wrong selection of input variables. therefore, we removed highly diverse three structures and used remaining  <dig> inhibitors for qsar modeling. interestingly, the performance of model was found to be enhanced in comparison to the model developed using  <dig> inhibitors. further, qsar modeling carried out with highly non-correlated  <dig> descriptors i.e efreebind, eelec, and eintr  provided better correlation values in comparison to the earlier six descriptors  based qsar model. therefore, removal of redundant descriptors reduced the noise and enabled the better training of qsar models. the three non-correlated descriptors appeared to be governing factors in establishing structure actvity relationship for dhdps enzyme. one of the possible reasons for their selection was a higher pair-wise correlation value with respect to ki in comparison with other descriptors i.e. eftot, emlmr and etors removed during qsar modeling.

among three descriptors, the value of efreebind based descriptor was found to be dependent on other two descriptors i.e. eelec, and eintr as well on other correlated energy based descriptors . generally, in the absence of receptor's flexibility eintr remains constant and does not make any significant contribution to efreebind, however, the flexibility incorporates transformations leading to internal energy changes. in the present study, the changes in the value of eintr were observed as the lys <dig> was kept flexible. it was noticed that inhibitors with lower ki value were characterized by high negative eintr values. these inhibitors included aliphatic compounds generally the pyruvate and aspartate semialdehyde analogues. on the other hand, inhibitors such as inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig> and inh- <dig> with higher ki values exhibited lower negative eintr. in view of this, we suggest eintr based descriptor is an important discriminating variable for developing robust qsar models. further, eelec was also found to be imperative as variations in the eelec values was highly dependent on the number and type of receptor residues involved in establishing charge interactions with inhibitors. we observed that inhibitors such as inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig> and inh- <dig> with strong electrostatic interactions with receptor exhibited strong binding, resulting in higher negative efreebind and eelec values that in turn provided lower ki values. a few inhibitors such as inh- <dig> and inh- <dig> characterized by aromaticity, the strong electrostatic or π-cationic interactions though provided higher negative eelec values however, at the cost of reasonable reduction in the eintr values, which in turn provided higher ki values, in comparison to the aliphatic inhibitors and the ones with weak electrostatic interactions. in addition, it was also figured out that inhibitors i.e. inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig>  inh- <dig> and inh- <dig> exhibited strong affinity to receptor albeit no or very weak electrostatic interactions were observed. this suggest that binding of inhibitors to dhdps is not specifically dependent on electrostatic interactions, however other bonded and non-bonded interactions appeared to be playing important role, which in turn provided higher negative efreebind values and lower ki values .

as we have employed a complex procedure of using docking generated energy-based descriptors for qsar modeling; therefore, it became imperative to compare the model performance with simple conventional 2d qsar models. the svm based 2d qsar model achieved a poor correlation value of  <dig> / <dig>  in comparison with docking energy-based svm model  indicating inadequacy of 2d descriptors in providing acceptable and robust qsar model for dataset of  <dig> inhibitors. this low performance of 2d qsar models may be due to presence of high structural diversity among the inhibitors that was not easily captured using simple 2d descriptors.

to conclude, the present strategy of predicting ki values using docking generated energy-based descriptors for qsar modeling is a promising approach to predict potent inhibitors against dhdps enzyme.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we describe a new approach for prediction of antibacterial compounds that both take qsar and docking strategy into its consideration. by using this approach, we get promising results instead of using these two strategies individually and develop a webserver called kidoq. this webserver will be helpful for better prediction of antibacterial compounds against dihydrodipicolinate synthase .
