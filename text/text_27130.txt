BACKGROUND
growth traits can directly affect production of beef cattle, which is an economically important sector of global agriculture. both body weight measurements and visual trait scores of conformation, precocity and muscling are used to select calves and steers for breeding and to predict carcass parameters. various factors can regulate growth traits through the modulation of gene expression levels, and genomic variation is one of the mechanisms, which is not only persistent but also inherited. to date, several genomic variations, such as str  and snp  have been employed to identify genetic markers related to cattle growth traits  <cit> . copy number variation  belongs to another family of genetic markers, which could affect gene expression and consequently phenotypes by changes in gene structure and dosage  <cit> . in human and mouse studies, cnv was found to account for  <dig> to 30 % of the genetic variation in gene expression and showed critical roles in both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility  <cit> . however, only few studies have been published using cnvs as candidate markers for genetic selection and disease association at the genome level because the traditional cnv discovery studies tried to detect as many variable regions as possible, instead of emphasizing common cnvs shared by different individuals  <cit> .

the application of cnv information in animal breeding had long been held back due to the lack of reliable genotyping methods for cnvs. in livestock, most cnv studies had been limited to cnv detection methods . studies performing cnv association with body traits were mainly focused on single rather than genome-wide cnvs . several studies attempted to predict the effects of cnvs on phenotypes based on the function of genes within the cnv regions. for example, an earlier study in holstein cattle reported cnv loci enriched for solute carriers and abc transporters that may affect milk production traits  <cit> . exploration of genome-wide association study  using cnvs and phenotypes has just gotten started recently. our previous studies have indicated that cnvs could be associated with resistance or susceptibility to gastrointestinal nematodes in angus cattle  <cit>  and residual feed intake in holstein cows  <cit> . a study on chinese cattle has shown that one cnv region  had significantly negative effects on expression of pla2g2d gene and two cnvrs were associated with body measurements  <cit> . subsequently, we have reported and characterized  <dig> significantly associated cnvs with milk production traits in holsteins  <cit>  and found one deletion polymorphism associated with resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes in angus cattle  <cit> . the increase in resolution of the snp microarray data dramatically improves the accuracy and the number of cnv detected. up to now, no systematic study of the relationship between cnvs and beef growth traits using snp microarray data with high resolution has been published.

few cnv studies including bos indicus data have been reported. we once performed a high resolution cnv analysis in  <dig> animals of  <dig> breeds, which included  <dig> animals with bos indicus background  <cit> . nellore is one the most important sub-breeds of bos indicus cattle, which is predominant in brazil, the world’s second largest producer of cattle. they are farmed for beef that can be seriously affected by growth traits. the present study is the first using common cnvs to detect association with production traits in bos indicus. using bovinehd genotyping beadchip assay data of  <dig> nellore bulls and cows, we detected common cnvs and performed a systematic gwas analysis between cnvs and nine growth traits in order to identify candidate cnvs and genes that could be used in cattle genetic improvement programs.

RESULTS
cnv segments and genotyping
in total,  <dig>  cnvs were extracted by the multivariate method supplied by golden helix svs  <dig> . <dig>  after merging all the segments, we found  <dig> non-redundant cnv events  occurring in the  <dig> individuals analyzed. as generally accepted, a cnv is one type of structural variation ranging from 50 bp to 5 mb  <cit> . we used a two-step strict method to filter possibly false cnvs. first, we calculated the frequencies of the three cnv types and filtered those appearing in less than  <dig> samples . then, cnvs over 5 mb were filtered out. in fact, when we filtered cnvs with low frequency, there were only two cnvs over 5 mb with frequencies of  <dig>  %. this meant that large segments were mainly predominant with low frequency and could be removed by a high frequency threshold. finally, a total of  <dig> cnvs with high confidence, ranging from 894 bp to  <dig> ,088 bp, were retained and used in further analysis. they were named as cnv <dig> to cnv <dig>  according to their loss frequencies from highest to lowest . we performed  <dig> quantitative pcrs to validate  <dig> selected cnvs in  <dig> samples and over 80 % of the results were in agreement with our svs predictions .fig.  <dig> distribution of the high confidence cnvs and significantly associated cnvs on each chromosome. outside circle: distribution of the high confidence cnvs, the height of histograms represents the variant frequency of each cnv; inside circle: distribution of the significantly associated cnvs and its overlapped genes; colors of the histograms for variant frequency: red, over  <dig> ; yellow, between  <dig>  and  <dig> ; black, under  <dig> 



traits’ correlation analysis
body weight measurements and visual scores are important traits in the evaluation of carcass yield for beef cattle selection in field conditions. in this study, nine related body traits were selected to be employed in further analysis: birth weight , post weaning gain , weaning gain , conformation at weaning , muscling at weaning , precocity at weaning , conformation at yearling , muscling at yearling  and precocity at yearling . estimated breeding values  were available for all traits, and only samples with accuracy of at least  <dig>  were analyzed for each trait. in order to assess whether these traits present genetic correlations, we computed pearson product-moment correlation coefficients for all pairs of the nine traits from  <dig> nellore cattle with complete data . the results showed that bw and pwg had low correlation , and they were both positively correlated with wg showing r values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. interestingly, the correlation of these body weight traits with the visual traits of conformation, precocity and muscling  exhibited regularly increasing trends along with the increasing age. bw had no or low correlation with visual traits. on the other hand, the body weight traits after birth  had higher correlations with cpm, especially wg, which showed strong correlations with cw  and cy . as expected, the six cpm traits were all positively correlated with each other in our study. precocity and muscling were strongly correlated with the lowest value of  <dig>  between mw and py. lower correlations  were seen for conformation traits with the other four cpm traits. since these traits were not independent, it is expected that certain cnvs may be associated with two or more related body traits and fewer significantly associated cnvs would be found than expected as compared to the situation where the nine traits were independent. moreover, as these correlations suggest genetic dependence among traits, cnvs regulating two or more traits may be considered as pleiotropic structural variants.fig.  <dig> pairwise pearson correlation coefficients for the nine body traits



cnv significant association analysis
it is difficult to directly use the traditional cnv discovery method in cnv-based gwas since they tend to expand cnv counts instead of finding common cnvs  <cit> . in this study, we performed a genome wide association analysis using the  <dig> cnvs and three body weight traits plus six visual  traits. there were  <dig> significant associations identified among  <dig> cnvs and  <dig> body traits. no significantly associated cnvs were found for bw and pwg. the lowest p value for bw was  <dig> . cnv <dig> and cnv <dig> had trends to be associated with pwg, with p values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. for the other seven traits, we found  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cnvs significantly associated with wg, cw, cy, mw, my, pw and py, respectively . among the  <dig> cnvs, two cnvs  were significantly associated with all  <dig> traits, and seven cnvs  were commonly associated with all of the precocity and muscling traits. cnv <dig> had trends to be related to cw  and it was related to all other six traits with significance. additionally, only nine cnvs had their unique associated body traits. those results were consistent with the trait correlation results.fig.  <dig> manhattan plots of associated cnvs for wg and cpm traits. negative log 10-transformed p values from a genome-wide scan were plotted against genomic coordinates on  <dig> autosomal chromosomes

significant cnv characterization
we compared the  <dig> significantly associated cnvs discovered with those previously described in hou’s study with the same cattle genome reference  <cit> . only  <dig> cnvs were not supported by hou’s study. the frequencies of the  <dig> cnvs ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, with the lowest frequency cnv <dig> located at chr3: <dig> ,000- <dig> , <dig> and the highest frequency cnv <dig> located at chr1: <dig> ,097- <dig> , <dig>  the longest cnv was also cnv <dig> with  <dig>  bp and the shortest cnv <dig>  was 1632 bp. to further analyze the association between discovered cnvs and body traits, we overlapped the  <dig> significant cnvs with previously reported qtl at the cattle qtl database . considering all together,  <dig> cnvs were found to be overlapped with qtls . there were three cnvs  overlapped with qtls that regulate intramuscular fat which is highly related to the growth traits. iron content is an important factor affecting the quality of beef, including color and flavor. we found cnv <dig> significantly associated with mw, overlapping with qtls related to iron content, suggesting that there may be some relations between iron content and mw. it is noted that although we used comparatively strict criteria to examine the overlap of cnv with qtl, some of them may be due to chance.

cnvs can have dramatic phenotypic consequences caused by altering gene dosage, disrupting gene coding sequence or perturbing long-range gene regulation. we compared the locations of the  <dig> significantly associated cnvs with the bovine refgene database . there were  <dig> cnvs overlapping with  <dig> genes . among these  <dig> genes, five  were overlapped by at least one exon on their 5’ terminal end. cnv <dig> and cnv <dig> were completely located at the last introns of ephb <dig> and col26a, respectively. conversely, five genes were completely located within two cnv regions . cnv <dig> was also overlapped with the 9th intron of pancc. nucleotide sequence variation in the promoter region can also affect the corresponding gene’s expression. we also examined whether any cnvs overlapped with regions up to 2000 bp upstream of gene transcript start sites but none was found.

kcnj <dig> as a candidate gene for muscling
several of the genes found in this study might contribute to body traits, when associated with overlapped cnvs, according to their gene ontology and pathway annotation in different species. we selected kcnj <dig> , located at chr19:  <dig> ,280- <dig> , <dig> as a candidate to do further analysis. its first exon overlaps with cnv <dig> , which was significantly associated with the two highly related traits , as well as being associated with the wg and the visual conformation traits. both muscling and precocity visual traits are designed to predict carcass features in the live animal, as an approximation of the muscle  contained in the carcass itself after slaughtering. previous studies have shown that kcnj <dig> gene family members were expressed in brain and muscle  <cit> . rna-seq analysis reported by previous studies revealed that bovine kcnj <dig> gene expression was significantly up-regulated from fetal to adult stage in longissimus muscle  <cit> , pointing out its role in muscle development.

however, to date, there is little knowledge about this gene in cattle. we first compared the amino acids sequence of kcnj <dig> in different species including cattle, human, mouse, rat, monkey, pig and dog, showing that kcnj <dig> was fairly conserved except for some variable amino acids in the 3’ termination among all the mammals . this means that the function of kcnj <dig> gene may also be conserved in the above species. according to the gene ontology annotation  database, the cattle kcnj <dig> gene has  <dig> go terms and it modulates the activity of inward rectifier potassium channel, which regulates the electrical activity of neuronal cells, insulin secretion and epithelial k+ transport  <cit> . since the muscle fiber number does not increase after birth  <cit> , the increase of muscle mass is mainly due to increase in length and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers stimulated by neural, hormonal and nutritional factors after birth. in human, kcnj <dig> was found to participate in muscling contraction process  <cit> . this may be one of the mechanisms by which kcnj <dig> regulates the amount of muscle mass through the modulation of muscle contraction in cattle. kcnj <dig> was annotated in the gabab receptor activation pathway, in which gabab receptors  are metabotropic transmembrane receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid  which are linked via g-proteins to potassium channels. previous studies reported that they were required for normal development and that, together with ionotropic gabaa receptors, gababr could help gaba to stimulate feeding which is another mechanism to promote muscle or even fat accumulation  <cit> . it’s worth mentioning that the cnv <dig> was also overlapped with qtls related to intramuscular fat and calf size. moreover, we checked the kcnj <dig> expression pattern in bovine gene atlas data   <cit> , hosted by the innatedb   <cit> . we found that it was expressed in  <dig> out of  <dig> tissues. it was highly expressed in multiple muscle types or muscle related tissues . we examined the effect of the cnv100’s copy number on the gene expression of kcnj <dig> in muscle tissues using qpcr. the nellore cattle with  <dig> copies of cnv <dig> had a significantly higher rna level of the kcnj <dig> gene than the nellore cattle with  <dig> copies had . therefore, kcnj <dig> might also help muscle accumulation by increasing food intake through cooperation with gabab receptors. in summary, the bovine kcnj <dig> gene could be selected as a candidate gene for muscling traits in beef cattle in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study applying gwas approaches between the common cnvs and bos indicus  growth traits using bovine high density snp microarray data. the use of high-density snp panels enabled the increase in four times the number of cnvs found when compared to holstein cattle using low density snp microarray data  <cit> . we identified  <dig> cnvs with high confidence and  <dig> of them were significantly associated with seven moderately or highly correlated growth traits. three cnvs  were found significantly associated with all the seven growth traits. our association study was also supported by the results of overlapping the cnv locations with known qtls and refgene databases. we selected kcnj <dig>  overlapped with cnv <dig>  to functionally assess and concluded that it may be a candidate gene for muscling through the modulation of muscle contraction and food intake.
