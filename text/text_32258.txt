BACKGROUND
approximately  <dig>  liver transplants are performed annually in the united states . the shortage of available organs, remains a major problem and contributes to a waiting list mortality greater than  <dig> deaths per  <dig> patient years on the waiting list  <cit> . the current donor shortage is further compounded by the increasing prevalence of hepatic steatosis in potential donors. fatty infiltration of the liver is now the most common adverse condition in potential donors, with a prevalence of 13-50% in some populations  <cit> . steatotic livers are more susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion  injury induced by both warm and cold ischemic periods during transplantation, which directly lead to higher rates of primary nonfunction and delayed graft function  <cit> . initial primary nonfunction predisposes to three-fold increased incidence of early rejection and graft loss within three months of transplantation  <cit> . the severity of i/r injury is associated with the degree of fatty infiltration. severely steatotic livers  are contraindicated for liver transplantation  <cit> . although, moderate steatosis  is a relative contraindication for transplantation, however, due to the limited availability of the organs, these allografts are also being used with greater frequency in several transplant centers  <cit> .

efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for poor graft function in steatotic livers. however, research to date has been limited by focus on individual pathways or molecules. given the numerous intracellular changes which are likely to occur, a global molecular approach is required to identify mediators of injury. proteomics provides one approach to identify and study potential biomarkers and mediators and offers the advantage of elucidating overall patterns of injury-induced changes at the protein level, including both changes in relative protein abundance and post-translational modifications of proteins  <cit> . proteomics has been successfully employed in the study of various liver injury models and models of ischemia/reperfusion   <cit> . high levels of oxidative stress and decreased levels of antioxidant proteins have been implicated as important mediators of injury due to ethanol-induced steatosis  <cit> . steatosis has been implicated to induce changes in the mitochondrial proteome  <cit> . the i/r injury in other organs is shown to increase mitochondrial permeability, contributing to activation of apoptotic pathways  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that proteins and enzymes involved in lipid and energy metabolism, redox signaling and oxidative stress responses were affected during cold and warm i/r phases in transplantation  <cit> . despite research into the mechanisms of injury in liver i/r and in steatosis, a comprehensive study on the proteome in liver subjected to i/r has not yet been studied. therefore, we performed a proteomic analysis on fatty rat livers following a period of warm ischemia to identify potential mediators of ischemia/reperfusion injury.

methods
animals
male obese  and lean  zucker rats were purchased from harlan laboratories . upon arrival at the pathogen-free barrier facility at washington university in st. louis, rats weighed  <dig> to  <dig> grams and were 8–11 weeks old. animals had access to standard chow ad libitum and were maintained on a 12 h light-dark cycle. animal protocols were approved by the animal studies committee of washington university in st. louis and experiments were performed in accordance with the national institutes of health guidelines for the use of laboratory animals.

liver ischemia
a model of selective  hepatic warm ischemia was used. anesthesia was induced with 3% inhaled isoflurane and maintained with  <dig>  - 2% isoflurane. animals were placed on a warming table and the abdominal wall was shaved and sterilized with betadine. laparotomy was performed through a midline incision. the portal triad was dissected free of surrounding tissue. portal vein and hepatic artery branches to the left and median hepatic lobes were identified and occluded with a microvascular clamp for 45 min . this method of partial hepatic ischemia prevents mesenteric venous congestion and permits decompression of the gut through the right hepatic vessels. observed blanching of the left and median hepatic lobes confirmed appropriate placement of the clamp. the abdomen was covered with saline-moistened gauze during ischemia. upon portal clamp removal, evidence of reperfusion was observed through immediate color change of the left and median lobes. the abdominal wall was closed with a running 4– <dig> monofilament suture. after 1 h of reperfusion, a median lobectomy was performed by ligation of the median lobe portal pedicle with a 4– <dig> silk suture. the left lobe was removed in a similar manner after two hours of reperfusion. all tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at-80°c until processing.

sample preparation
the sample preparation for two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis was performed with liver protein extracts as previously described  <cit> . individual pieces of frozen liver tissue  from lean or obese animals were covered with liquid nitrogen in a pre-cooled biopulverizer  and crushed to a fine powder. each sample was solubilized in lysis buffer , 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% chaps), and the total protein content was determined using the advanced protein assay . a total pool was generated using equal amounts of each pool to represent all proteins found in the study. an aliquot containing 50 μg of protein from each sample was diluted to 50μl with lysis buffer , 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% chaps) and labeled with  <dig> pmol of charge-matched cyanine dyes  3--3-ethyloxacarbocyanine halide n-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester  for lean, or 1--10-methylindodicarbocyanine halide n-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester  for obese. all chemicals unless otherwise specified were obtained from sigma-aldrich . the total pool sample was labeled using 1--10-propylindocarbocyanine halide n-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester  for combined protein pool as internal standard for intergel comparison. the pool consisted of all  <dig> samples and was prepared by combining 50 μg of each individual sample. all labeling reactions were carried out for 45 min at 4°c and protected from light. the reaction was quenched with 10 nmol of lysine for 10 min . labeled lean and obese samples were combined with a total pool aliquot and the resulting mixture was diluted by addition of 300 ml of rehydration buffer )  <cit> .

two dimensional electrophoresis  and imaging
each combined tripartite-labeled sample  was rehydrated into 24 cm, 3– <dig> nl ipg strips  under low voltage  for 12 h, followed by isoelectric focusing  using a protean ief cell  for a total of  <dig>  kvh . after focusing, proteins were reduced by placing the ipg strips in 10 ml of equilibration buffer , 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% sds, bromophenol blue) containing freshly prepared dtt  for 15 min at room temperature. the proteins were then alkylated by adding iodoacetamide . ipg strips were then rinsed with 1x sds running buffer  and layered on 10-20% polyacrylamide gels and sealed with agarose . commercially prepared gels  were cast between low-fluorescence glass plates using bind-silane  to attach the gel to one plate as per the manufacturer’s instructions. second-dimension sds-page separation was carried out on all gels simultaneously using 5 w/gel for the first 15 min followed by 1 w/gel for 17 h with circulating buffer  in the lower buffer chamber. images of the labeled proteins in each gel were generated using a typhoon imager  and the following excitation/emission wavelengths for each dye . after image generation, the nonsilanized glass plate was removed and the gels were placed in fixing solution  for 2 h. gels were then rinsed with deionized water  for 15 min and stored in water-filled, sealed bags at 47°c. all steps were performed to minimize exposure to ambient light.

gel image analysis
protein features with significant abundance ratios  between experimental groups  were selected by gel image analysis  and analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography /mass spectometry . imagequant  software was used to crop the gel images and remove portions of the image corresponding to the ipg strip, the spacers between the gel plates, and any remaining dye front from the electrophoresis. the decyder  dia  module was used to identify gel feature boundaries and calculate abundance ratios using a normalization algorithm that was applied as previously described  <cit> . standard parameters were used to determine boundaries estimating  <dig>  features per image. gel artifacts were removed by software from each gel image using a peak volume filter set at  <dig> . additional gel artifacts  were excluded manually. images were compared across multiple gels using the decyder bva  module. this analysis matched features in the pool images from each gel, using this sample as a quantitative reference for protein features in the remaining images allowing quantitative comparison of features in all images in the experiment. the decyder extended data analysis  module was used to perform t-test analysis and generate heatmaps. matched features with significant differences in abundance ratios  or with abundance ratios >  <dig>   and 100% gel presence were selected for further analysis.

gel digestion, preparation of peptides and mass spectrometric analysis
selected features were excised robotically  using a triangulation algorithm implemented with in-house software. proteins in the gel pieces were digested in situ with trypsin  <cit> , and stored at −80°c until analyzed by mass spectrometry. samples were analyzed using a nanoflow  pulse-free liquid chromatograph, interfaced to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer  using a picoview system , or nano-reversed-phase hplc interfaced to an electrospray-linear ion trap-fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometer  operated as previously described  <cit> . the ms and ms/ms data were collected in the profile mode. the “raw” files were processed using mascot distiller, version  <dig> . <dig>   and searched using mascot version  <dig> . <dig> against the uniprot rat database  with  <dig>   <dig> entries . the resulting dat files were imported into scaffold, ver.  <dig> . <dig>  to identify proteins with greater than or equal to 95% confidence and to determine the spectral counts for each protein. the detailed mass spectrometry and peptide data are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

network and pathway analysis
proteins identified from the uniprot database were imported into ingenuity pathway analysis  software, version  <dig>   to generate interactive protein networks. duplicate gi numbers were manually removed prior to loading. gi numbers were loaded into ipa; proteins not recognized by ipa were removed from analysis. a network analysis was performed with limitations set at  <dig> proteins; direct and indirect relationships were permitted. core analysis of the protein set generated, producing  <dig> interactome networks.

gene networks were created by submitting gene symbol lists to the granite web application , a tool to generate gene relational networks . the “enhanced” granite function was used to discover genes not present in but are targets of or interact with submitted gene sets. gene sets combined with any discovered genes were reloaded into granite to complete connections from discovered genes to genes in the original list. raw and filtered granite output was directly loaded into cytoscape for network integeration and visualization  <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of protein targets in warm i/r injury
to analyze the differences in the proteome leading to warm i/r injury in steatotic livers, total protein was collected from lean and obese zucker rats. a 50 μg protein sample individually collected from lean and obese rats subjected to i/r injury were labeled with cyanine dye cy <dig> and cy <dig>  respectively, and subjected to 2-de with an ief range of ph  <dig> to  <dig>  the proteome of lean and obese rats were compared following  <dig> and 2 h of reperfusion . the total protein pool of 25 μg was treated with cyanine dye cy <dig> and run on 2-de as internal standard to compare between intergel variability. the differential in gel analysis  module for software decyder v  <dig>   was used to calculate the protein spot volumes and normalized volume ratio for each differentially labeled co migrated protein . the values of  <dig> standard deviations of the mean volume ratios were between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and only features with greater than  <dig>  fold changes in volume in both gels per time point were defined as altered. as shown in lower panel of figure 1b-d, there is no significant difference between the  <dig> and 2 hr reperfusion of lean rats, and similarly there is no significant difference between the  <dig> and 2 hr reperfusion of obese rats.

a heat map generated from the decyder extended data analysis  module  was utilized for hierarchical clustering and additional statistical analysis. as shown in figure 2b, an initial analysis showed  <dig>  features on the gels which have a volume ratios  variance of at least greater than  <dig> . this ratio was taken as a threshold value above or below which spot volume observed in the analytical gels were considered significant. the standardized abundances of all features matched protein features were compared across four analytical protein gels , and students’ t-test was performed with the decyder biological variance analysis  module to validate the significance of the detected difference between spot volumes at p <  <dig> . a total of  <dig> features were selected from the initial automated analysis. manual inspection for artifact elimination , and further statistical analysis, produced  <dig> features of interest  for feature excision, in-situ gel digestion and identification using tandem mass spectrometry with database searching.

identification of the differentially regulated proteins by mass spectrometry
the  <dig> features of interest identified by anova analysis on the 2-de were excised subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and the peptide pools from each excised feature were analyzed using nano-lc-ms, as described under ‘materials and methods’. the database searches were qualified using the protein prophet algorithm  within the scaffold software. the analysis identified  <dig> proteins with  <dig> peptides in the  <dig> ‘differential’ features . these lead protein targets were utilized for further analysis to identify the biochemical pathways involved in the i/r injury.

differential expression of er stress related molecular chaperones in steatotic liver after i/r compared to lean liver
no differential gene expression was observed between  <dig> and 2 h of reperfusion in either the steatotic liver or the lean liver. therefore, steatotic liver tissue from 1 h and 2 h reperfusion were pooled, and lean liver tissue obtained after  <dig> or 2 h reperfusion were pooled. all further analysis was performed to compare protein expression between fat and lean liver samples. one hundred four proteins with significant abundance ratios were identified. a pubmed/medline search was performed for each protein by protein name and corresponding gene id. based on published literature in this database, proteins were grouped according to functional category. functional grouping revealed four categories of importance: molecular chaperones/endoplasmic reticulum  stress, oxidative stress, metabolism, and cell structure . hypoxia up-regulated  <dig> , calcium binding protein  <dig> , calreticulin , heat shock protein  <dig> , heat shock protein  <dig> , and protein disulfide isomerase  <dig>  were chaperonins down-regulated in steatotic liver following i/r. only one chaperonin, heat shock protein  <dig> , was significantly upregulated.

ingenuity pathway analysis identifies four molecular chaperone mediated pathways as the critical targets of i/r injury
ingenuity pathway analysis was used to determine relationships of our known significant proteins with each other and other known proteins in the literature which did not show differential expression in our project. ipa generated nine networks, with  <dig> proteins mapping into at least one of these networks . a network of great significance was that representing cellular assembly and organization, protein degradation, with connections to more than  <dig> identified proteins with differential expression from the liver samples. this included four of the chaperonins previously identified: hyou <dig>  calr, hsp90b <dig>  and pdia <dig>  these four proteins were indirectly related through interactions with akt, a well-known serine/threonine kinase, and x-box binding protein- <dig>  ), a key mediator in one of three er stress response pathways. a total of  <dig> proteins were identified in functional or canonical pathways. not surprisingly, the greatest functional categories and canonical pathways with differential profiles between steatotic and lean liver were those involving amino acid metabolism and small molecule biochemistry.

discussion
the recent genomic revolution has resulted in a paradigm drift in the comprehensive analysis of biological processes and biochemical regulators. a continuous body of literature strongly indicating a non-predictive correlation between mrna and protein level expression  <cit> , along with posttranscriptional modifications leading to control in the rate of synthesis and half-life of proteins place  <cit>  an increased importance on the direct measurement of the protein expression by proteomic techniques to analyze the biochemical signaling pathways. in this report using various proteomics based approaches we determine the key role of regulatory molecular chaperonins in the i/r injury in the setting of liver steatosis.

the demand for liver allografts remains a challenging problem for transplant centers in the us and across the globe, especially with the increasing prevalence of hepatic steatosis in the donor population  <cit> . attenuation of steatosis-associated ischemia/reperfusion injury is an important strategy for reducing allograft shortages. proteomic analysis is an important tool for large-scale analysis of cellular changes induced through various injury models, including that of hepatic ischemia . this particular analysis revealed that the proteome profile of steatotic liver following a period of warm ischemia/reperfusion significantly differs from that of lean liver. some functional groups, such as those involved with amino acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and cellular structure, are expected to be significantly different in steatotic liver, regardless of i/r injury. a novel finding, however, was the significant down-regulation of multiple molecular chaperones. chaperonins have important roles in protein folding and structure  <cit> . disruptions in cellular homeostasis can cause perturbations in protein processing, resulting in an accumulation of unfolded proteins. this triggers the “unfolded protein response” , or endoplasmic reticulum  response, a response to cellular stress which can lead to adaptation or trigger apoptotic pathways  <cit> . chaperonins reduce er stress by stabilizing proteins which become unfolded during periods of cellular stress . pdia <dig> encodes erp <dig>  a known molecular chaperone with well-established interactions with calreticulin and their role in antigen-processing/loading of mhc class i molecules  <cit> . erp <dig> is also known to regulate grp <dig>  a key molecular chaperone in initiating one of three er stress signaling cascades  <cit> . the chaperonin subset of proteins, with these molecules in particular, represent potential therapeutic targets for mitigating i/r injury.

the akt pathway, a serine/threonine kinase, has been shown to play an important role in various types of ischemia/reperfusion. although it did not show significant differential expression at the reperfusion time points analyzed in our study, akt is indirectly related to multiple chaperonins which do play a significant role in protein folding and processing, and have implicated roles in endoplasmic reticulum stress in other models. akt has also been shown to play a role in er stress. given these relationships which we have identified, it is likely that er stress plays a role in the greater injury sustained by steatotic liver following intervals of ischemia/reperfusion  <cit> . also, certain key mediators of the unfolded protein response , atf <dig>  and chop) are shown to be upregulated in both a murine model of hepatic warm i/r and a rat liver transplant model  <cit> .

the potential role of chaperones as drug targets has been well established. previous studies in our laboratory using a chaperones targeting small chemical molecule, taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid , has shown to decrease er stress response and decrease ischemia repurfusion injury in animal models of steatotic liver allografts  <cit> . the role of chaperones in ischemia injury has also been established in other transplant models such as cardiac myocytes  <cit> . not just limited to transplant settings, but in other disease states such as malaria, chaperones are considered as important drug targets  <cit> . however, in our initial study along with chaperones/er stress protein group we have also identified other protein groups such as oxidative stress, metabolism, and cell structure. although, it is currently unclear of their potential role in drug targeting these protein groups in ameliorating i/r injury and enhancing survival of steatotic liver allografts, future research on these protein groups could offer novel molecular targets.

certain inherent limitations with 2-de based proteomics approaches associated with artifacts and database subset mapping in identifying exact target proteins  <cit>  warrants further direct cell based functional studies to validate our current findings. lean liver tissue served as the comparison, or control, for steatotic liver subjected to warm ischemia and a short period of reperfusion; however, it might be revealing to compare these samples to liver tissue not subject to i/r. samples obtained at additional reperfusion times would help establish a trend in protein expression profiles. in spite of limitations we still consider our current study to add new insights and further research to study the functional basis and potential chaperonin-based therapeutic strategies to enhance long term survival of the liver allografts.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, using a broad-based proteome analysis, we identified key differences between ischemic responses in steatotic and lean livers. down-regulation of the chaperonins identified in this analysis may contribute to the increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress and, consequently, apoptosis and necrosis observed in steatotic livers compared to lean livers. the proteins identified in this report, provide an initial platform for investigating the role of molecular chaperones in i/r injury in fatty liver and provide potential therapeutic targets for increasing viability of steatotic liver allografts.
