BACKGROUND
the formin family consists of large multidomain proteins that control cytoskeletal organization  <cit> . formins are conserved in all eukaryotes, where they govern complex cellular processes such as cell shape and motility, migration and cytokinesis. the human genome contains  <dig> formin genes that are subdivided in diaphanous-related formins  and non-drfs. the protein family is defined by the formin homology  <dig> domain , capable of polymerization straight actin filaments. fh <dig> attaches to the actin filament during elongation, protecting it from capping proteins. almost all formins contain a proline-rich formin homology  <dig> domain  n-terminal to fh <dig>  fh <dig> enhances actin nucleation by recruiting profilin-bound actin monomers for fh <dig> actions.

formin-like  <dig> , a member of the drfs, contains a gtpase-binding domain and autoregulatory domains, and is proposed to function as a downstream effector of rho family guanosine triphosphatases   <cit> . rho gtpases influence cell morphology by activating effectors in different cellular compartments. as most formins, the mouse fmnl <dig> orthologue is known to polymerize actin filaments  <cit> .

furthermore, drfs are tied to transcriptional regulation, mediating the activation of serum response factor . srf activation in turn, leads to transcription of several cytoskeleton-associated genes  <cit> . recently, a microdeletion including the fmnl <dig> gene was associated with precocious puberty, short stature and severe mental retardation  <cit> .

as actin regulation is a fundamental process, inherited or acquired defects in this complex activity can result in different diseases. these include developmental disorders, muscle disorders, various neoplasias, immune deficiencies, diseases of the nervous system and kidney diseases. as key regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics, formins are interesting not only from a biological but also from a disease perspective. despite intensive studies, the distinct functions of different formins remain unresolved. fmnl <dig> mrna is expressed in many normal tissues and cancers  <cit> . surprisingly, the presence of fmnl <dig> protein has not systematically been studied by immunohistochemistry in any species, possibly due to the lack of antibodies suitable for such analysis. the aim of this study was to determine the expression profile of fmnl <dig> in normal human tissues, using an antibody designed for immunohistochemistry. the expression pattern can be used as a reference in further analyses of fmnl <dig> biological functions and disease associations.

methods
mrna expression analysis
the genesapiens database was utilized to study the fmnl <dig> mrna expression across all human normal tissues  <cit> . all the samples included in this database have been analyzed on the affymetrix platform and due to unique normalization and data quality verifications, gene expression profiles collected from different studies can be combined to generate an overview of the expression profile in human tissues.

tissue samples and immunohistochemistry
tissue samples were collected for this study prospectively from surgical specimens sent to the department of pathology at the turku university central hospital for diagnostic purposes. informed consent was asked before surgery. the procedure was approved by the hospital district ethics committee. within one hour from surgical removal, macroscopically normal tissue areas were sampled. central nervous tissue specimens were an exception, as autopsy material was collected. tissues were fixed in formalin, dehydrated, paraffin-embedded and sectioned.

immunostaining was performed using the streptavidine-peroxidase method, using a labvision autostainer device. for antigen retrieval, the slides were treated with citrate buffer . endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% h2o <dig>  after  <dig> min incubation in normal nonimmune serum at 37°c, the sections were incubated  <dig> min at 4°c in affinity-purified rabbit fmnl <dig> antibody . after washing with pbs, the sections were treated with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by streptavidine-peroxidase. diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogene. individual tissues and cell types were evaluated by scoring the staining intensity by grading from  <dig>  to + + + .

northern hybridization of human cell lines
total rna was isolated from the cell line samples using trizol reagent , according to manufacturer instructions. the concentration of rna was determined spectrophotometrically and the quality was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining by evaluating the integrity of 28s and 18s ribosomal rnas. northern blotting, hybridization and the detection of the hybridized probe was performed according to dig application manual for filter hybridization  with some modifications. briefly,  <dig>  μg of total rna was size-fractionated on a denaturing  <dig> % agarose/formaldehyde gel and stained with ethidium bromide. rna was blotted to a positively charged nylon membrane  by capillary transfer. rna was treated with  <dig> mm naoh before transfer. the membrane was uv-crosslinked  and equal quantity of transfered rna samples was checked with ethidium bromide. after prehybridization for an hour in high sds hybridization buffer  at 50°c, the membrane was hybridized in the same solution overnight at 50°c with a denaturated dig-11-utp labelled human fmnl <dig> rna probe . the sequence of the probe matched the antibody epitope . the final washing conditions were  <dig>  × ssc,  <dig> % sds at 65°c for two times  <dig> min. the amount of hybridized probe was visualized with alkaline phosphatase labelled anti-digoxigenin fab fragments  and chemiluminescent detection using cdp-star substrate .

western blotting of human cell lines
cells from seven different human lines  were harvested and lysed in elb buffer , 1% nonidet p- <dig> or in ripa buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. samples were normalized for protein concentration and equal amounts of material in laemmli sample buffer were subjected to sds-page, transferred to nitrocellulose filters and immunoblotted with fmnl <dig> antibody  in bsa/tbs/tween  <dig> %, followed by secondary antibody . bound proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. to verify the specificity of the fmnl <dig> antibody, its reactivity was blocked by  <dig> hour preincubation with a 100-fold molar excess of the gst-fmnl <dig> - fusion protein , or as a control, with gst. the α-tubulin antibody, used as a control for protein loading, was from invitrogen.

fmnl <dig> small interfering  rna
fmnl <dig> expression was silenced in mkn- <dig> and wm <dig> cells using smartpool sirna . non-targeting pool sirna  was used as a control. cells were transfected with dharmafect  <dig>  according to manufacturer's instructions. fmnl <dig> levels were examined in cell lysates  <dig> hours after transfection by immunoblotting.

immunocytochemical analysis
wm <dig>  a <dig> and mkn- <dig> cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for  <dig> min. the cells were permeabilized in cold acetone for  <dig> min. after  <dig> min in 1% bsa in pbs, the cells were incubated for one hour with the fmnl <dig> antibody , followed by a secondary antibody, alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit . f-actin was visualized with alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin . the mounting media contained dapi for staining nuclei . in control slides the primary antibody was replaced with 1% bsa in pbs. the cells were imaged with a zeiss lsm  <dig> meta confocal microscope . image j  <dig> q  software was used in picture analyses.

RESULTS
antibody validation
the fmnl <dig> rabbit anti-human polyclonal monospecific antibody was produced by the swedish human proteome resource , in a project with emphasis on generating antibodies for immunohistochemistry  <cit> . an epitope specific for fmnl <dig>  was chosen for recombinant protein production of protein epitope signature tags  and for immunization. rabbit polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified and initially validated by elisa-based prest-array of antibody specificity. in this assay, the antibody was highly specific.

to further validate the fmnl <dig> antibody, western and northern blot analyses were carried out on several cell lines. based on sequence information, the predicted molecular mass of fmnl <dig> is  <dig> kda. the fmnl <dig> antibody detected a single band slightly higher than expected size  in the human cell lines mcf- <dig>  hacat, a <dig>  mkn- <dig> and wm <dig>  no band was detected in jurkat and k <dig> cells . the reactivity of the antibody was confirmed by a peptide competition assay. preincubation of the antibody with gst-fmnl <dig> fusion protein resulted in loss of the  <dig> kda band in all three tested cell lines, a <dig>  mkn- <dig> and wm <dig>  whereas preincubation with gst did not alter the reactivity .

as a further test, wm <dig> and mkn- <dig> cells were transfected with fmnl2-specific sirna or with control sirna, and lysates were blotted with the fmnl <dig> antibody. fmnl <dig> knockdown resulted in markedly reduced or undetectable antibody reactivity, whereas control sirna had no effect on antibody reactivity .

the fmnl <dig> transcript in the cultured cells was analyzed by northern blotting. the analysis revealed a major  <dig>  kb transcript in all four cell lines, in which fmnl <dig> was detected by western blotting. in a <dig>  mkn- <dig> and wm <dig> cells an additional weaker and smaller band was seen. in jurkat cells, no transcript was detected .

fmnl <dig> mrna expression in human tissues
to gain an overall picture of fmnl <dig> mrna expression in various human tissues, gene expression data from genessapiens database was utilized. fmnl <dig> mrna expression profile across human tissues is presented in figure  <dig>  overall, fmnl <dig> mrna was widely expressed. the highest mrna expression was seen in central and peripheral nervous systems. relatively high expression was detected in ovary, placenta, colorectal tissues, respiratory and endocrine systems, and salivary gland. the lowest expression of fmnl <dig> was seen in bone marrow, testis, liver/biliary system, heart and pancreas  <cit> .

immunohistochemical analysis of fmnl <dig> in human tissues
immunohistochemical analysis of  <dig> different human tissues was performed, and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  examples of the staining results and cellular distribution of fmnl <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  as an overall impression, most tissues and cell types expressed fmnl <dig> although the staining intensity varied. the subcellular location of fmnl <dig> was cytoplasmic and the distribution appeared to be uniform.

* <dig> = no staining, + = weak staining, + + = moderate staining, + + + = strong staining

central nervous system
in the brain, both nerve cells and glial cells expressed fmnl <dig> widely and abundantly . in samples taken from  <dig> different areas of the brain, moderate to strong staining was seen in neurons, oligodendroglial cells and astrocytes alike.

respiratory system
in the lung, expression was strong in alveolar macrophages, but weak in alveolar epithelium . the respiratory epithelium in bronchi expressed fmnl <dig> strongly.

gastrointestinal system
fmnl <dig> expression was strong in epithelia of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and colon. moderate expression was seen in the glandular cells of parotid gland.

in the esophagus, pancreas and liver, staining was weak indicating low expression. however, the pancreatic neuroendocrine cells of langerhans islets showed intense immunoreactivity . while most cell types had uniform cytosplasmic staining, the secretory epithelia stained granularly and enterocytes had a particularly strong apical perinuclear dot. ganglion cells, representing the peripheral nervous system, expressed fmnl <dig> abundantly.

endocrine organs
samples from thyroid gland, parathyroid gland and adrenal gland were studied. in all three locations, fmnl <dig> was strongly expressed. expression was equally strong both in the cortex and medulla of the adrenal gland. follicular epithelial cells of the thyroid gland and parathyroid chief cells also expressed fmnl <dig> strongly. parathyroid oxyphil cells, in contrast, stained weakly.

urinary system
samples from kidney and urinary bladder were analyzed as examples of the urinary system. fmnl <dig> was present in both tissues. in the kidney, mesangial cells did not express fmnl <dig>  podocytes, on the other hand, expressed fmnl <dig> abundantly . tubular epithelial cells varied in intensity, most tubules stained moderately. in the urinary bladder, urothelial cells expressed fmnl <dig> moderately. intensity was weaker in umbrella cells than in basal cells.

female reproductive system
in the fertile ovary, fmnl <dig> was expressed in several cell types. granulosa cells surrounding the maturing oocyte expressed fmnl <dig> strongly. the oocyte itself, as well as stromal cells, expressed fmnl <dig> moderately. in the uterus, myometrial smooth muscle cells expressed fmnl <dig> moderately. a perinuclear particularly strongly staining dot was noted. secretory phase endometrial glands expressed fmnl <dig> strongly, stromal cells weakly . in the non-lactating breast, fmnl <dig> was strongly expressed in both ductal and lobular epithelium. myoepithelial cells stained moderately. in the full term placenta, both syncytiotrophoblast and trophoblast cells expressed fmnl <dig> strongly, whereas the staining of stromal cells was weak .

male reproductive system
fmnl <dig> immunoreactivity was detected both in testis and prostate. in testis, strong expression was seen both in spermatocytes and sertoli cells. leydig cells, in contrast, expressed fmnl <dig> weakly. in the prostate, epithelial cells expressed fmnl <dig> moderately, with an especially strong perinuclear apical dot . smooth muscle cells stained weakly. moderate staining was seen in prostatic peripheral nerves.

haematopoietic system
samples from lymph node, spleen and bone marrow represented the hematopoietic system. in all these tissues, fmnl <dig> was detected. in both the lymph node and spleen, fmnl <dig> was widely and strongly expressed. in the bone marrow, erythroid cells did not express fmnl <dig>  megakaryocytes, on the other hand, expressed fmnl <dig> abundantly. myeloid cells stained moderately .

skin
fmnl <dig> was present in epidermal keratinocytes and adnexal structures. in the epidermis, basal layers stained moderately. expression gradually weakened toward the surface. superficial cells did not express fmnl <dig> 

vasculature
in vessel walls, fmnl <dig> expression was weak or negative in endothelial cells. in muscular arteries, also smooth muscle cells stained weakly.

skeletal muscle
in striated muscle, weak fmnl <dig> expression was detected. fmnl <dig> was uniformly distributed, without a striated pattern.

subcellular distribution of fmnl <dig> in wm <dig>  a <dig> and mkn- <dig> cells
to study the subcellular location of fmnl <dig> in detail, wm <dig>  a <dig> and mkn- <dig> cells were stained with fmnl <dig> antibody, phalloidin and dapi. confocal microscopic analysis revealed a primarily cytoplasmic distribution of fmnl <dig> in all three cell types. fmnl <dig> often showed perinuclear accumulation in wm <dig> and a <dig> cells, consistent with the golgi apparatus . a similar staining pattern was occasionally observed in mkn- <dig> cells .

in mkn- <dig> and a <dig> cells, fmnl <dig> staining did not co-localize with f-actin, visualized by phalloidin staining. instead, in wm <dig> cells a partial overlap was seen. in contrast to the other cell types wm <dig> cells contained protrusions with long actin filaments. dots containing both fmnl <dig> and f-actin were observed at the tips of these protrusions in most of the analyzed cells .

discussion
the expression of different formin proteins in human tissues has not been systematically investigated. as the protein family has  <dig> members, the proteins are expected to possess individual and different functions and expression patterns, reflecting the demands for cytoskeletal regulation in various cell types. here, we set out to investigate how widely fmnl <dig> is expressed by using immunohistochemistry. an antibody was raised for this purpose. after validation by western and northern blotting, as well as a peptide competition and sirna experiments, we conclude that this antibody is specific and suitable for immunohistochemistry.

fmnl <dig> mrna has been reported to be expressed in many normal tissues  <cit> . using a large set of information on fmnl <dig> transcripts, we confirmed that fmnl <dig> mrna indeed can be detected in virtually all tissues  <cit> . highest expression was seen in the central nervous system, followed by the peripheral nervous system and several epithelial tissues. a consistent result was achieved by immunohistochemical analysis of  <dig> tissues. in the central nervous system, expression was wide, as strong expression was seen both in neurons and supporting glial cells. strong expression was, however, not exclusive for nervous tissues. moderate or strong expression was seen in most epithelia and lymphatic tissues. especially gastric, intestinal, mammary and endocrine epithelia expressed fmnl <dig> strongly. connective tissue components including fibroblasts, endothelium and adipose cells expressed little or no fmnl <dig>  it will be interesting to study whether fmnl <dig> expression changes in invasive cancer, when epithelial cells lose their polarity and cell-to-cell contacts.

in the hematopoietic system, lymphocytes, myeloid precursors and macrophages displayed moderate to strong fmnl <dig> expression. erythroid precursors, as well as mature red blood cells were negative. consistent with this, no fmnl <dig> was detected by western blotting in the k <dig> erythroleukemia cells. such cell-type specific expression in cells differentiating from a common precursor may have clinical implications. another drf, diaphanous  <dig> , has been linked to bone marrow disease. mdia <dig> knockout mice develop age-dependent myeloproliferative defects mimicking human myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes  <cit> . fmnl <dig> could also be involved in diseases with defects in myelopoiesis. however, the phenotype of an fmnl <dig> knockout mouse has not been described.

one of the epithelia expressing fmnl <dig> was colon. the expression was relatively high both as analyzed by mrna signal and immunohistochemistry. our findings are distinct from the results reported in a study linking increased fmnl <dig> expression to metastatic activity in colorectal cancer. in that study, normal colorectal epithelium was reported to be devoid of fmnl <dig> or express it only weakly  <cit> . the difference may be due to several causes. the previously reported antibody may have a lower sensitivity than ours, resulting in positive immunoreactivity only in tissues with exceptionally high fmnl <dig> expression. also, the antibodies may have different isoform-specifity. the antibody used for the colorectal cancer metastasis study was directed toward an antigen in fmnl <dig> isoform  <dig> that shares 91% identity with fmnl <dig> isoform  <dig>  it is possible that the antibody has weaker or no affinity to fmnl <dig> isoform  <dig>  in contrast, the antibody used in our study was raised towards a sequence common to both isoforms. the colorectal metastasis study illustrated the relative change of fmnl <dig> expression in normal colon and colorectal adenocarcinoma, especially metastatic disease. at this point, we conclude that normal colorectal mucosa does express fmnl <dig>  but do not compare the level of expression to cancer. thus, our results do not necessarily contradict the conclusions made. our preliminary transcription analysis indicates that fmnl <dig> expression is up-regulated in several forms of cancer, and future studies will be directed to find the ones where this difference has biological and medical relevance.

uncontrolled proliferation, combined with invasive and metastatic potential, is a hallmark of malignancy. rho gtpases have been shown to mediate cytoskeletal changes essential for malignant cell behavior in vitro, and evidence of in vivo relevance is mounting. rho gtpases activate effector molecules in different cellular locations. effectors, in turn, mediate cytoskeletal changes  <cit> . identifying rho gtpase effectors is crucial for understanding actin remodeling in normal and malignant cells. fmnl <dig> contains a gtpase binding domain. recently, fmnl <dig> was identified as a specific rhoc effector  <cit> . in the same study, rhoc and fmnl <dig> were, by using rna interference, found to be essential for the invasive motility of rounded human melanoma cells. fmnl <dig> silencing did not affect the invasive capacity of breast carcinoma cells or fibrosarcoma cells, which display a more mesenchymal elongated morphology. in our study, confocal microscopy of wm <dig> melanoma cells revealed a co-localization of f-actin and fmnl <dig> at the tips of cell protrusions. a <dig> squamous cell carcinoma cells and mkn- <dig> gastric carcinoma cells had a different, unspiked morphology and in these cells fmnl <dig> and f-actin were not co-localized. these results are in agreement with the finding that fmnl <dig> has cell-specific functions and that it has a special role in protrusions of invading melanoma cells.

as rho gtpase expression levels change in malignancies, changes in effectors are to be expected. without doubt, several other formins will in the near future be identified as effectors specific rho gtpases. understanding the cascades behind malignant cell behavior in different malignancies can ultimately offer targets for novel therapies.

CONCLUSIONS
with a novel fmnl <dig> antibody, we show that immunohistochemistry is a useful method of investigating fmnl <dig> expression in human tissues. in healthy tissues, fmnl <dig> is widely expressed. highest expression is in the central nervous system. in melanoma cells, fmnl <dig> shows a distinct co-localization with actin dots in cellular protrusions. studies on fmnl <dig> in cancer tissues are warranted.
