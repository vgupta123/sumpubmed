BACKGROUND
panax ginseng c. a. meyer is a widely used medicinal plant with multiple clinical and pharmacological effects related to cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. it also promotes immune and central nervous system function as well as relieving stress  <cit> . the major bioactive components of p. ginseng are the ginsenosides, a group of dammarane- and oleanane-type triterpenoid saponins. the total ginsenoside content is highest in the flower, followed by the root, leaf and stem  <cit> . the large size and high complexity of the p. ginseng genome, which is reportedly tetraploid and ~ <dig>  gb in size  <cit> , has made it difficult to obtain a complete genomic sequence for this species. many researchers have obtained genomic information for p. ginseng by employing expressed sequence tags , which are considered an efficient tool for gene discovery, especially in plants lacking an assembled genome  <cit> . previous studies have generated ests derived from p. ginseng roots, rhizomes, seeds and leaves using the sanger method  <cit> . however, as this method has a high cost and is very time consuming, only  <dig>  ests obtained using this technique have been deposited in ncbi to date. next-generation sequencing  technologies provide a rapid and economical way to sequence extremely large amounts of genetic material  <cit> . for example, chen et al. generated  <dig>  ests from 11-year-old p. ginseng roots via  <dig> sequencing  <cit> . given that different tissues exhibit specific gene expression patterns, it is necessary to obtain the global transcriptome of other tissues to obtain full genomic information for p. ginseng.

ests are considered to represent a reliable source of data for predicting micrornas  and their targets, especially in species without complete genome information  <cit> . mirnas are important regulators in a wide range of developmental processes in plants, including cell proliferation, the stress response, metabolism, inflammation and signal transduction  <cit> . mirnas have been identified successfully from plant est databases based on sequence conservation and characteristic mirna features  <cit> . however, mirnas have not yet been identified from p. ginseng.

simple sequence repeats , also termed microsatellites, are nucleotide motifs consisting of tandem repeats of two to six base pairs. it is more likely for ssrs from ests  to be tightly linked to specific gene functions and perhaps even play a direct role in controlling important agronomic traits  <cit> . to date, only  <dig> ssrs have been identified in p. ginseng <cit> .

in the present study, we globally sequenced the transcriptomes of the roots, stems, leaves and flowers of 4-year-old p. ginseng plants. novel and tissue-specific p. ginseng unigenes were obtained. furthermore, our database includes all of the genes encoding enzymes involved in ginsenoside backbone biosynthesis and modification. based on the obtained unigenes, we also identified  <dig> potential p. ginseng mirnas and  <dig> of their potential target genes. moreover, a total of  <dig>  est-ssrs were identified from the p. ginseng unigene dataset, which will facilitate marker-assisted breeding of p. ginseng.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
to characterize the transcriptome of p. ginseng and generate expression profiles, we sequenced cdna samples from four p. ginseng tissues  using a roche/ <dig> gs-flx  pyrosequencing machine. one half run was performed for each sample, yielding approximately  <dig>  million raw reads, ultimately totaling ~ <dig>  billion base pairs . of these ests,  <dig> % were over  <dig> bp in length. the size distributions of the raw reads from the four samples are shown in additional file  <dig>  to acquire high-quality reads, we filtered out adapter sequences and reads that were shorter than  <dig> bp. the high-quality reads from each sample were then used to build a de novo assembly using gs de novoassembler software, v <dig> , both for each tissue individually and for all tissues as a group. the size distributions of the contigs from each tissue are presented in additional file  <dig>  after assembling the reads from all four tissues together, the generated contigs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, with an average size of  <dig>  bp, while the size of the singletons ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, averaging  <dig>  bp. we obtained  <dig>  unique sequences, totaling approximately  <dig>  mb. all of the high-quality reads generated in this study have been deposited at ncbi and can be accessed in the sequence read achieve  sequence database under project accession number srp <dig>  this transcriptome shotgun assembly project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under accession gaag <dig>  the version described in this paper is the first version, gaag <dig>  a summary of the  <dig> sequencing and assembly results for the four tissues is shown in additional file  <dig>  and the data for together assembly is presented in table  <dig> 

the current p. ginseng est library found in the tsa database contains  <dig>  ests from 11-year-old root tissue  <cit> . these ests are included in the  <dig>  homologous unigenes revealed in the 4-year-old p. ginseng root transcriptome examined in the present study. furthermore,  <dig>  novel p. ginseng root unigenes were discovered in this study, some of which may be specifically expressed in 4-year-old roots. whereas there are  <dig>  ests in the ncbi database that were obtained via  <dig> and sanger sequencing,  <dig>  homologous genes and  <dig>  novel unigenes were discovered in the present study. the large quantity of novel unique sequences identified in this study constitutes a powerful resource for p. ginseng researchers.

functional annotation and candidate genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of ginsenosides
to obtain the most informative and complete annotation, all of the contigs from roots, stems, leaves and flowers were annotated separately. the numbers and percentages of the annotated unique sequences are presented in additional file  <dig>  in total,  <dig>  unique sequences presented at least one significant match in the public databases. the remaining unigenes that were not annotated appeared to be either p. ginseng-specific genes or homologous genes with unknown functions in other species.

based on the annotation results, transcripts encoding all of the known enzymes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis and modification were identified in our dataset . in most cases, multiple unigenes were annotated as corresponding to the same enzyme . such unigenes may represent different fragments of a single transcript or different members of a gene family.

chen et al.  <cit>  analyzed the transcriptome of 11-year-old p. ginseng roots and discovered many genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis. however, several genes encoding key enzymes involved in ginsenoside skeleton biosynthesis were absent, such as mevalonate kinase , geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase , amyrin synthase  and dammarendiol synthase . from the global tissue transcriptome analysis, we obtained higher coverage genetic information and more candidate genes for further analysis. mvk, gps and ds were found in our 4-year-old root cdna library . this difference of results may be due to these three enzymes being actively expressed in the 4-year-old p. ginseng root, but expressed only at a low level in the 11-year-old p. ginseng root, or to the high coverage of the 4-year-old root transcriptome. as was absent in both the 4- and 11-year-old p. ginseng roots but was found in the 4-year-old p. ginseng stems, leaves and flowers in the transcriptome database. this result may indicate that the biosynthsis of oleanane-type ginsenosides might be actived in the stem, leaf and flower of 4-year-old p. ginseng, but not in the root of the 4- and 11-year-old p. ginseng.

specific cyp450s catalyze the conversion of dammarenediol-ii or β-amyrin to various ginsenosides. han et al. identified the involvement of cyp716a <dig> in the hydroxylation of the c- <dig> position to yield protopanaxadiol  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> putative cyp <dig> unigenes were identified, including the cyp716a <dig> gene. based on our cyp <dig> pool, further research will be performed to identify other cyp450s that may participate in ginsenoside biosynthesis in p. ginseng. glycosylation, the transfer of activated saccharides to an aglycone substrate, is the predominant type of modification that occurs in the last step of ginsenoside biosynthesis. glycosylation of dammarane- and oleanane-type aglycones is required for ginsenoside bioactivity. in this study,  <dig> putative udp glycosyltransferase  unigenes were found in the p. ginseng transcriptome, of which  <dig> showed a high sequence similarity to the candidate glucosidase genes identified in p. quinquefolius by sun et al.  <cit> . these putative p. ginseng ugts included contig <dig>  contig <dig>  contig <dig>  contig <dig>  contig <dig> and contig <dig> from the database derived from assembling all tissues simultaneously. the roles of these candidate ugt unigenes in ginsenoside biosynthesis need to be further characterized.

comparative and gene ontology analyses of p. ginseng root, stem, leaf and flower unigenes
unigene sequences of the p. ginseng four tissues were compared with each other and was shown by a venn diagram . the four tissues shared  <dig>  unigenes, which likely include housekeeping genes playing key roles in p. ginseng. the number of unigenes only can be found in the database of each tissue was  <dig>  for the root,  <dig>  for the stem,  <dig>  for the leaf and  <dig>  for the flower. the number of unigenes which can only be found in root database was highest among the four tissues, maybe because that the root expressed more genes than the other three tissues. the unigenes only found in the stem, leaf and flower databases corresponded to  <dig> % of the novel genes discovered in our study and might represent genes controlling development in different tissues.

gene ontology  is widely used to standardize the representation of genes across species and to provide a controlled vocabulary of terms for describing gene products  <cit> . the contigs from four tissues were assigned go terms based on blastp searches against sequences with products whose functions were previously identified. these go terms were summarized into three main go categories  according to the standard go terms and  <dig> sub-categories . in each tissue, the biological process category comprised the majority of go annotations, followed by the cellular component and molecular function categories. the percentage of each sub-category in each tissue was quite different. notably, within the biological process category in the root transcriptome, multicellular organismal process and growth were the most dominant subcategories, reflecting the rapid growth occurring in the root. in the other three tissues, the dominant subcategory was response to stimulus. for the cellular component category, the most highly represented subcategory in roots and leaves was extracellular region part, while in stems, it was organelle and in flowers, it was extracellular region. under the molecular function category, the main subcategory in roots and leaves was catalytic activity, while it was transcription regulator activity in stems and binding in flowers. these go annotations represent a general gene expression profile signature of the different tissues of p. ginseng and demonstrate that the genes expressed in these different tissues encode diverse structural, regulatory and stress response proteins.

analysis of the predominant transcripts in p. ginseng roots, stems, leaves and flowers
the abundance of particular transcripts within a specific tissue provides clues about the biological processes occurring there. the most highly expressed genes observed in each cdna library are listed in table  <dig>  the genes encoding catalase and superoxide dismutase were present in all four cdna libraries and presented particularly high levels in the root. catalase and superoxide dismutase are two antioxidant enzymes that play key roles in antioxidant defense systems and in the protection of plant cells against oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species  <cit> . other abundant transcripts in the root-derived library encoded a latex-like protein, ribonuclease-like storage protein,  <dig> -alpha-glucan branching enzyme and some proteins with unknown functions, which could be p. ginseng-specific proteins.

in the stem-derived cdna library, the most highly expressed gene encoded phloem protein  <dig> -like protein. pp <dig> is involved in the assimilate stream and has the capacity to interact with the mesophyll plasmodesmata to increase their size exclusion limit as well as cell-to-cell trafficking  <cit> . the second most highly expressed gene encodes a dehydration-related protein involved in the response to environmental stresses  <cit> . genes encoding photosynthesis-related proteins, such as chlorophyll a-b binding proteins, peroxidase and the photosystem ii psbk protein, were also found to be abundant in the stem. genes encoding chlorophyll a-b binding proteins were the most highly expressed genes in the stem-, leaf- and flower-derived libraries, and the root-derived cdna libraries also contained several transcripts of chlorophyll a-b binding genes. this difference may be because stems, leaves and flowers are all chloroplast-containing tissues, whereas there are no chloroplasts in the tissues found in the root.

the most highly expressed genes in the leaf-derived cdna library encoded proteins including ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, photosystem ii  <dig> kda polypeptide and the chlorophyll a-b binding protein, as well as some proteins with an undefined function. ribulose biphosphate carboxylase was also the most abundant transcript in the flower-derived libraries. ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase catalyzes the initial step in the photosynthetic fixation of carbon dioxide  <cit> .

histone h <dig>  aquaporin and a photosystem ii  <dig> kda polypeptide represented the three dominant transcripts in the flower-derived cdna library. histone h <dig> acetylation within euchromatic and heterochromatic domains plays a key role in dna replication  <cit> . in higher plants, aquaporins are water channel proteins that facilitate the passage of water through biological membranes and play a crucial role in plant growth  <cit> .

all of the predominantly expressed transcripts in each of these four tissue-derived cdna libraries belong to the group of  <dig>  genes shared by the four tissues. these genes are normally associated with housekeeping functions and play key roles in p. ginseng growth and development. some housekeeping genes exhibit high expression levels in specific tissues, as observed for transport-related genes in the stem and photosynthesis-related genes in the leaf. this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the proteins encoded by these genes are responsible for the characteristic functions of the corresponding tissues.

identification and characterization of potential mirnas in p. ginseng
mirnas are a class of noncoding, small endogenous rnas, ~ <dig> nucleotides  in length that have been shown to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting mrnas for degradation or inhibiting protein translation  <cit> . there are currently  <dig>  mirnas that have been identified from  <dig> plant species deposited in the mirbase database  <cit> . however, no mirnas have been identified in p. ginseng until now. because only mature mirna sequences  are conserved among plant species, mature mirna sequences were used as queries for blast searches against the high-quality p. ginseng reads derived from our experiments. this process yielded  <dig>  reads that were found to significantly match at least one mature mirna sequence with no more than two mismatches and that could be related to either a target or an mirna precursor sequence. a total of  <dig>  noncoding reads were obtained after removing repeat and protein-coding sequences. ultimately, we identified  <dig> candidate p. ginseng mirnas with a proper mirna precursor secondary structure and a minimal folding free energy index  of at least  <dig>  .

ml, mature length; nm, number of mismatches in mirna/mirna* duplexes; arm, location of mature mirna; pl, precursor length; mfe, minimal folding free energy; mfei, minimal folding free energy index; est id, the high quality reads number which can be accessed in the sra sequence database under project accession number srp <dig> 

mature mirna sequences can be located on either arm of the secondary stem-loop hairpin structure of the potential mirna precursor . of the  <dig> identified p. ginseng mirnas,  <dig> were found to be located on the 5′ arm of the stem-loop hairpin structure, while  <dig> resided on the 3′ arm. the length of the putative p. ginseng mirnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, with an average of 21 ±  <dig>  nt. the majority  of the mirnas were  <dig> nt in length. the length of the p. ginseng pre-mirnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, averaging 143 ±  <dig> nt. the length distribution of the mirnas and their precursor sequences was similar to the distributions described in previous reports in other plant species  <cit> .

the minimal folding free energy  is important for the formation of rna secondary structures. generally, the lower the mfe, the more stable the secondary structure of a given rna sequences. the average mfe value obtained in the present study for the p. ginseng mirnas was − <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol, with a range of − <dig>  to − <dig>  kcal/mol. the minimal folding free energy index  is a criterion for distinguishing mirnas from other rnas. previous studies have shown that a sequence is more likely to be a potential mirna if it presents an mfei value greater than  <dig>   <cit> . for the  <dig> newly identified p. ginseng mirnas, the average mfei was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , with a range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the secondary structures of the putative p. ginseng mirna precursors are reported in additional file  <dig> 

target prediction for the p. ginseng mirnas
identification of mirna target genes, in addition to constituting indirect existence evidence of mirnas, is a fundamental step for the determination of biological function for mirnas. evolutionarily conserved targets have been shown to be useful in testing the effectiveness of mirna target detection. a perfect, or near perfect, complementarity between an mirna and its target mrna, which is a peculiar feature of plant mirnas, provides a powerful tool for the identification of target genes through blast analysis of mature mirna sequences against est sequences. after carefully considering the alignment results, we predicted at least one target for  <dig> mirnas and a total of  <dig> potential targets for  <dig> mirnas . there were  <dig> and  <dig> targets predicted for mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, while the targets associated with other mirnas were much less abundant, or may have failed to be sequenced. zhou et al. detected a large number of targets for mir <dig> and mir <dig> and a small number for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> in rice  <cit> . mirnas with a large number of targets may represent nodes in gene regulatory networks, while those with a small number of targets may act through more specialized pathways.

several studies have demonstrated that mirnas can target transcription factors that control plant growth and development  <cit> . in the present study, the putative p. ginseng mir <dig> was predicted to target the transcription factor apetala <dig> , which plays an important role in the control of the flowering time and floral morphology. mir <dig> has also been shown to target ap <dig> in tobacco, the opium poppy and brassica oleracea <cit> . aukerman and sakai found that overexpression of mir <dig>  which targets ap <dig>  causes early flowering and suppresses the floral organ specification in arabidopsis <cit> . in addition, this study suggested that myb proteins might be the target of mir <dig> in p. ginseng. previous studies have also shown that myb proteins may be targeted by mir <dig> in b. oleracea <cit> . the myb transcription factors found in plants constitute a superfamily of proteins with a conserved myb dna binding domain that play a regulatory role in developmental processes and defense responses  <cit> . zinc finger protein family members were predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  zinc-finger proteins orchestrate the responses of plants to changes in environmental conditions and play a central role in reactive oxygen and abiotic stress signaling in arabidopsis <cit> . other mirnas identified in this study, such as mir403b, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  can be considered putative regulators of gene expression at the protein level.

identification of simple sequence repeats  in p. ginseng
ssrs are one of the most powerful types of molecular marker because of their relative abundance and ease of generation, and they have been widely applied for molecular-assisted selection  in plant breeding programs  <cit> . ssr markers derived from expressed sequence tags are likely to be even more transferable across lines, populations and species than random genomic ssrs  <cit> . in this study, a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  unigenes, with  <dig>  of the p. ginseng unigenes containing at least two ssrs. the observed frequency of unigenes was  <dig> %, and the distribution density was  <dig>  per mb. as is shown in table  <dig>  the most abundant repeat type was dinucleotides , and the most common number of tandem repeats was  <dig> . the dominant repeat motif was ag/ct, with a frequency of  <dig> % . the primer pairs for each ssr conforming to a series of primer-designing parameters  are offered in additional file  <dig> for further investigation of the potential of these ssrs as genetic markers.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a large-scale est investigation was performed in root, stem, leaf and flower tissues from p. ginseng. the obtained est dataset provides a comprehensive resource for gene discovery and genetic analyses in p. ginseng. the genes identified in this study will help to decipher the molecular mechanisms of secondary metabolism in p. ginseng. moreover, this study identified putative mirnas from p. ginseng and their targets, thus representing a foundation for further research into transcriptional regulation. finally, the large set of ssrs identified in this work provides abundant genetic markers for molecular breeding and genetic applications in this species.
