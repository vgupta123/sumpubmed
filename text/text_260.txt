BACKGROUND
plant resistance genes  play an important role in direct or indirect recognition of proteins encoded by specific avirulence  genes of pathogens  <cit> . in recent years, a large number of r genes which confer resistance to diverse pathogens have been cloned from different plant species by using either map-based cloning or transposon tagging approaches  <cit> . based on the amino acid sequence comparison among cloned r genes, several highly conserved domains, such as nbs, lrr, protein kinase , transmembrane domain , and tir were identified as the majority of known r genes  <cit> . these distinct conserved domains provide scientists a convenient way to identify and then clone additional r genes and rgls or resistance gene analogs .

the largest class consists of r genes which contain nbs and lrr domains . this class can be further divided into two sub-classes, tir-nbs-lrr and non-tir-nbs-lrr, based on the presence or absence of a tir domain at the n-terminus  <cit> . the second class of r genes is comprised of those with lrr and pk domains , such as fls <dig> in arabidopsis and xa <dig> in rice  <cit> . the third class contains those with a large extracellular lrr domain, for example, cf- <dig> in tomato and vf <dig> in apple  <cit> . the fourth class contains those only with the pk domain, such as pto in tomato and pbs <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . and finally, the fifth class includes all other r genes that confer resistance through different mechanisms, for example, hm <dig> in maize and mlo in barley  <cit> .

based on conserved domains of known r genes, pcr amplification has been successfully used to isolate rgls or rgas from arabidopsis  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , and many other plant species  <cit> . for example, bertioli et al. isolated  <dig> rgas from cultivated and wild peanuts by using degenerate primers designed on nbs conserved domains  <cit> . leal-bertioli et al. identified candidate genome regions for disease resistances by using a combination of nbs profiling, sequence characterized amplified region  markers, and southern blot by probes with nbs encoding regions  <cit> . in common bean, eight classes of disease resistance related sequences and  <dig> rgas have been isolated based on the conserved nbs and tir domains  <cit> . an rga, sb <dig>  was found to cosegregate with the crg gene which is known to be responsible for resistance to the rust pathogen uromyces appendiculatus  <cit> .

recently, data-mining approaches have been employed to identify rgls and rgas from plant est databases. in maize,  <dig> rgls have been identified using data-mining, modified amplified fragment length polymorphism , and rapid amplification of cdna ends  methods  <cit> . in sugarcane, rossi et al. identified  <dig> r-gene-like ests via the data-mining method  <cit> . in wheat, dilbirligi and gill found  <dig> expressed r-gene candidates using modified rna fingerprinting and data-mining approaches  <cit> . in medicago, zhu et al. have revealed  <dig> unique nbs-lrr rgls by using combination methods of database queries, hybridization with rgls from related species, and pcr  <cit> . with the availability of several complete and nearly complete plant genome sequences, r gene analyses at the whole genome level have been carried out in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , and lotus  <cit> . as a result,  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding genes and an additional  <dig> related genes have been identified in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . also  <dig> predicted nbs-lrr genes were identified in the rice genome, all of which belong to the non-tir-nbs-lrr class  <cit> . from the medicago truncatula draft genome , ameline-torregrosa et al. have identified  <dig> non-redundant nbs-lrrs and predicted  <dig> to  <dig> nbs-lrrs in the full genome  <cit> . in the lotus genome,  <dig> nbs-encoding sequences have been isolated and nearly 40% of them are pseudogenes encoding incomplete protein sequences  <cit> . with advances in sequencing technologies over the past few years, next-generation sequencing technologies have become widely available and have dramatically accelerated biological research  <cit> , making identification of r gene homologs and members of other related gene families by data-mining methods much more efficient.

common bean  is one of the most important legume crops in the world. due to its high protein and low fat content, it has become a principal source of dietary protein and fiber in many developing countries, especially those in eastern and southern africa and latin america  <cit> . diseases such as anthracnose, angular leaf spot , rust, common bacterial blight , and bean golden yellow mosaic virus  highly reduce bean production and quality. for example, cbb is a serious seed-borne disease that can cause over 40% yield loss in both temperate and tropical bean production regions  <cit> . rust can cause 18% to 100% yield loss of susceptible bean genotypes under favorable environmental conditions  <cit> . therefore, it is very important to better understand disease resistance in common bean.

the objective of this study was to identify expressed rgls from common bean and to develop rgl-tagged molecular markers for genetic mapping of candidate genes and qtls for disease resistance.

RESULTS
identification of rgls from  <dig> sequences and ests in genbank
more than  <dig>  million sequences with  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  were generated by  <dig> sequencing from an adapter-ligated normalized cdna collection from four different plant organs  of common bean. after clustering and assembling using the newbler software from roche , these sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons with sequence size more than  <dig> base pairs  <cit> . moreover,  <dig>  common bean ests are available in genbank . therefore, a total of  <dig>  sequences were used for identification of rgls.

full length protein sequences of the  <dig> known r genes  were used to perform tblastn searches against 454-derived sequences and common bean ests in genbank. a total of  <dig> contigs and nine singletons from 454-derived sequences and  <dig> common bean ests were identified with scores more than or equal to  <dig> and e values less than or equal to 1e- <dig>  after clustering,  <dig> non-redundant sequences were developed and considered as tentative p. vulgaris rgls, named as pvrgls . the average size of pvrgls was about  <dig>  base pairs, although some fragments were  <dig>  base pairs or longer. among these  <dig> tentative pvrgls,  <dig>  pvrgls were from 454-derived sequences,  <dig>  were from common bean ests, and  <dig>  pvrgls were present in both of the groups .

in addition, all tentative pvrgls were used to identify their putative functions by blastx searches against the genbank databases. among the  <dig> tentative pvrgls,  <dig> belonged to the nbs-lrr class,  <dig> belonged to the lrr, lrr-tm, and lrr-pk classes,  <dig> belonged to the pk class, six were similar to r gene reated sequences with putative tm domains, and five showed high similarity to r genes with toxin reductase domains .

validation of expression of selected rgls
in order to determine whether the identified pvrgls from common bean were expressed, cdna was prepared from two-week old leaves of the genotype sierra grown in the greenhouse. rt-pcr was then used to amplify with primers specific to each of the  <dig> selected pvrgls. twenty four of the  <dig> primer pairs produced a single product and we showed amplification of  <dig> of these primer pairs . furthermore, to ensure that the amplification products actually amplified from expressed mrna and not from contaminating dna, we used genomic dna, cdna, cdna control , and water as templates to perform rt-pcr and the results showed that only dna and cdna have specific products, while cdna control and water have no products . based on these results, we concluded that there was no dna contamination in the cdna and our pvrgls were indeed expressed.

mapping identified pvrgls to the p. vulgaris genome
mapping of the identified pvrgls is important for isolation of candidates of a particular resistance gene or quantitative trait locus . recently, a finger_printed contigs  physical map has been established for common bean http://phaseolus.genomics.purdue.edu/ with about 9x coverage of the genome  <cit> . the common bean fpcs makes it possible to integrate some of the pvrgls into the physical map by comparison to bac-end sequences  <cit> . blastn search was used to determine those pvrgls matching to a bac-end sequence with the criteria of scores more than or equal to  <dig> and e values less than or equal to 1e- <dig>  as a result,  <dig>  of the  <dig> tentative pvrgls matched to bac-end sequences with minimum criteria and could be integrated into the physical map .

interestingly, there were five cases of two pvrgls and three cases of three pvrgls located to one physical contig: for example, pvrgl <dig> and pvrgl <dig> were located in the p. vulgaris physical map fpc_contig <dig> while pvrgl <dig>  pvrgl <dig> and pvrgl <dig> were located in the p. vulgaris physical map fpc_contig <dig>  surprisingly, pvrgl <dig> and pvrgl <dig> have a match to different regions of the same bac-end sequence pv_gba0056b <dig> r . another seven pvrgls matched to a genome survey sequence  with e value less than 1e- <dig> from other common bean genotypes in genbank.

mapping pvrgls to g. max pseudomolecules and p. vulgaris genetic map
in order to take advantage of the synteny blocks between common bean and soybean as per mcclean et al.  <cit> , we used the blastn algorithm to search against soybean genome with the same criteria as mcclean et al.  <cit> . given that nearly every common bean locus can match to two soybean loci, the best two soybean hits were selected. out of  <dig> pvrgls,  <dig>  pvrgls could be mapped to the g. max genome pseudomolecules. among the  <dig> pvrgls,  <dig>  have soybean hits with e value less than 1e- <dig>  the  <dig> pvrgls are broadly distributed among the  <dig> g. max pseudomolecules. among the  <dig> soybean loci matched to  <dig> pvrgls ,  <dig>  have transcripts. the annotation of these transcripts indicates most of them show high similarity to sequences containing nbs, lrr, pk, tm and toxin reductase domains . based on the comparison of pvrgls to the soybean genome sequences and the conserved blocks between common bean and soybean  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  pvrgls can be located in the p. vulgaris genetic map. the pvrgls are broadly distributed among the  <dig> p. vulgaris linkage groups, but the distribution was not even. p. vulgaris chromosome  <dig>  contained the largest number of pvrgls, 41; while pv <dig> contained the least number of pvrgls,  <dig> .

rgl-tagged molecular markers
ninety primer pairs were designed based on the  <dig> pvrgls matching to bac-end sequences. eighty two of ninety primer pairs  have specific products among the six genotypes. all of the pcr products were sequenced three times from both the 5' and 3' ends to ensure polymorphisms were not due to sequencing errors. the average fragment size was about  <dig> base pairs, while the range was from  <dig> to  <dig>  base pairs. approximately  <dig> kb of sequence data was collected from six genotypes for sequence analysis. sequence alignments indicated single nucleotide polymorphisms  and small insertions/deletions  occurred frequently. twenty three snps were related to restriction enzyme sites, and  <dig> small indels were identified.

based on small indels,  <dig> rgl-tagged sts markers gave rise to distinct and polymorphic pcr bands among six genotypes . likewise,  <dig> rgl-tagged caps markers have been obtained from those snps related to restriction sites , and each caps marker showed unambiguous polymorphic bands following digestion with its corresponding restriction endonuclease.

discussion
as a component of the gene-for-gene resistance mechanism in plants, resistance genes play an important role in recognizing products encoded by specific avirulence genes of a pathogen  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> tentative rgls from common bean were successfully identified by data-mining based on the availability of 454-derived sequences in our lab and common bean ests in genbank. about 60%  of identified pvrgls were from 454-derived sequences; moreover,  <dig>  of the  <dig> pvrgls were new transcripts.

ests are highly valuable for genome annotation and gene structure prediction  <cit> . the  <dig> sequencing is a faster and more cost-effective method of producing sequence data than the sanger method and is capable of producing a  <dig> to  <dig> million base pairs per run with  <dig> to  <dig> base pair read length  <cit> . it has been successfully used to maximize gene discovery, improve gene predictions, and detect snps and mutations  <cit> . in the past few years, data-mining approaches have been successfully used to isolate rgls or rgas from sugarcane  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . as reported previously, dilbirligi and gill  <cit>  adopted four different data-mining methods including domain search, individual and multiple motif searches, consensus sequence search, and individual full-length search to mine r-gene-like wheat sequences, and showed that the individual full-length search was the most successful method. there were  <dig> nbs-lrrs in addition to  <dig> other types of expressed r-gene candidates which were then isolated via an individual full-length search using a low e value of e- <dig>  <cit> . xiao et al.  <cit>  used three methods including modified aflp, race and data-mining to isolate rgas and r-gene-like ests from maize and found that the data-mining method is the most efficient way. a total of  <dig> expressed rgas were recovered from  <dig>  maize ests using a moderate e value of e- <dig> or better  <cit> . rossi et al. revealed  <dig> rgls from sugarcane ests by using a very stringent e value of e- <dig> or better and represented three major classes of r genes, namely nbs-lrr, lrr-tm and pk  <cit> . the above three research reports showed that different e values have a great effect on the number of resulting rga or rgls. in the present study, the moderate e value of e- <dig>  similar to that in maize, was used to mine common bean rgls and a total of  <dig> tentative pvrgls were identified. of the  <dig> tentative pvrgls,  <dig> belonged to nbs-lrr type,  <dig> belonged to lrr, lrr-tm, and lrr-pk type,  <dig> belonged to pk type, six and five contained sequences with similar to putative tm domains and toxin reductase domains, respectively. the number of rgls identified in the present study was about two times more than those in maize due to three reasons. firstly,  <dig>  million 454-derived sequences and common bean ests were screened to identify rgls in common bean, about three times more est sequences than those in maize . secondly,  <dig> sequencing can generate more sequence data than the sanger sequencing. therefore, transcripts at extremely low levels can be detected  <cit> . finally, some identified pvrgls match the same r genes or rgls. for example, pvrgl <dig> and pvrgl <dig> match different regions of the same bac-end sequence.

rt-pcr was used to examine the expression of the pvrgls in this study. results indicated that all of the selected pvrgls were actually expressed in the leaves of genotype sierra . in contrast, many rgls or rgas amplified from genomic dna using degenerate primers or mined from whole genome are not expressed  <cit> . previously, eight classes of disease-resistance related sequences were amplified from common bean dna using degenerate primers based on the conserved nbs domain  <cit> . expression analysis indicated that three rgas  were not expressed  <cit> . in lotus,  <dig> nbs-encoding sequences were considered as pseudogenes due to encoding of incomplete protein sequences  <cit> . in arabidopsis, at least  <dig> nbs-lrr-encoding genes were predicted to be pseudogenes due to frame shift and nonsense mutations  <cit> .

the pvrgls discovered in this study correspond to most of the  <dig> previous common bean r genes or rgas in the prgdb database  <cit> . pvrgl <dig> and pvrgl <dig> have strong hits to the p. vulgaris tl <dig> disease resistance protein gene with amino acid identity of 90% and 85%, respectively. tl <dig>  located in the i locus of common bean, controls resistance to bean common mosaic virus  <cit> . pvrgl <dig> matched to coiled-coil nbs-lrr -b <dig> with amino acid identity of 94%. cnl-b <dig> was mapped in the b <dig> r gene cluster which contained at least three r genes  and qtl effective against anthracnose, and bean golden yellow mosaic virus  <cit> . pvrgl <dig> was a part of polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein  gene. pgip can inhibit fungal endopolygalacturonases and is considered to be an important factor for plant resistance to phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . pvrgl <dig> was the same as, but much longer in the 5' end than the previous rgl sb <dig> and ob <dig>  <cit> .

so far, most of the known r genes have been cloned by map-based cloning and transposon tagging approaches  <cit> . therefore, mapping rgls and rgas to genomes and/or genetic maps is very important and will facilitate r gene cloning. in this study,  <dig> pvrgls could be integrated into the common bean fpc physical map by comparison of pvrgls to p. vulgaris bac-end sequences. additionally, we were able to anchor  <dig> pvrgls to the common bean genetic map by using conserved syntenic blocks between common bean and soybean. the pvrgls are broadly, but unevenly distributed among the  <dig> linkage groups of common bean with a strong tendency of clustering. for example,  <dig> pvrgls, the largest number, were mapped to pv <dig>  while  <dig> of them clustered at the bottom of pv <dig>  david et al.  also found that many specific r genes against various pathogens cluster together: for example, in the b <dig> resistance gene cluster,  <dig> bac clones  were identified by using a nbs probe prlj <dig> to screen a common bean bac library  <cit> . in the present study, pvrgl <dig> was anchored at the top of pv <dig> by in silico mapping. meanwhile, pvrgl <dig> shows high similarity  with bac-end sequence fi <dig>  and fi <dig> , respectively. pvrgl <dig> should be located in the b <dig> resistance gene cluster. the b <dig> resistance gene cluster contains various r genes resistant to different pathogens, such as colletotrichum lindemuthianum , uromyces appendiculatus , and pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola , in addition to qtls for resistance to bgymv and anthracnose; therefore further work will be needed to determine the role of pvrgl <dig>  in medicago, two superclusters of disease resistance genes were identified. one is located at the top of mt <dig> containing  <dig> cnl and  <dig> tnl encoding sequences. the other is located at the bottom of mt <dig> containing  <dig> tnl encoding sequences  <cit> . clustering of r genes facilitates the genetic variation of r genes and benefits in the evolution of new r genes. bertioli et al. found that retrotransposons were associated with the evolution of some resistance gene clusters via analysis of the synteny among arachis, lotus, and medicago  <cit> . several other hypotheses such as duplication, gene conversion, and unequal crossing-over have been proposed to elucidate r gene cluster and evolution  <cit> . therefore, further studies will be needed to better understand common bean r gene evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> pvrgls were identified from 454-derived sequences and common bean ests in genbank using data-mining. as a result,  <dig> and  <dig> pvrgls were mapped to the p. vulgaris fpc physical map and genetic map, respectively. rgl-tagged markers were developed for  <dig> unique pvrgls, including  <dig> sts and  <dig> caps markers. these methods and results will help develop more rgl-tagged molecular markers that can be used further for genetic mapping and the isolation of resistance genes from common bean in the future.
