BACKGROUND
homologous genetic recombination plays critical roles in meiosis, for genetic diversification and precise disjunction of homologous chromosomes. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic recombination is initiated by chromatin locus- and timing-specific dna double-strand breaks  <cit> , which require the function of the spo <dig> protein  <cit> . saccharomyces cerevisiae spo <dig> shares amino acid sequence homology with subunit a of the type ii dna topoisomerase  from the archaeon sulfolobus shibatae  <cit> . type ii topoisomerases generate double-strand breaks  at specified sequences in the cleavage complex, an intermediate for topological dna reactions, composed of the covalent complex of a topoisomerase subunit and the terminus of each dsb strand. as in the cleavage complex, spo <dig> covalently attaches to the 5' termini of a nascent meiotic dsb. spo <dig> is then removed from the dna by the endonuclease activity of mre <dig>  <cit> , and by the functions of the sae2/cpt <dig>  <cit>  and rad <dig> proteins  <cit> , but not by nbs <dig>  the third component of the mrn complex  <cit> .

spo <dig> is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, including s. cerevisiae  <cit> , the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe   <cit> , the fruit-fly drosophila melanogaster   <cit> , the nematode caenorhabditis elegans   <cit> , the basidiomycete coprinus cinereus  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> , and each has a single gene encoding a spo11-orthologue. thus, it has been assumed that spo <dig> is the essential protein to introduce dsbs for the initiation of meiotic recombination in eukaryotes .

in contrast to these organisms, searches for homologues of spo <dig> or top6a  in genome databases revealed that plants have multiple spo11-homologues: arabidopsis thaliana has atspo11- <dig>  atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  <cit> , and their homologues in indica rice  are ostop6a <dig> , ostop6a <dig>  and ostop6a <dig> , respectively  <cit> . genetic studies revealed that efficient meiotic recombination in arabidopsis depends on both the atspo11- <dig>  <cit>  and atspo11- <dig>  <cit>  gene products, which are involved in the induction of dsbs and the initiation of meiosis. in contrast, atspo11- <dig> plays a major role during somatic cell development, but not in meiosis and meiotic recombination. the loss of the atspo11- <dig> function results in abnormal endoreduplication, an extreme dwarf phenotype and deficient cell proliferation  <cit> . atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> interact with attop6b , as shown by two-hybrid studies  <cit> , suggesting that they function as dna topoisomerases. in rice, ostop6a <dig>  is required in rice meiosis  <cit> . as with atspo11- <dig>  overexpression studies in arabidopsis suggested the functions of ostop6a <dig>  and ostop6b in stress adaptation in mitosis  <cit> .

genetic studies indicated that spo11s play critical roles in dsb formation, for the initiation of meiotic recombination. in s. cerevisiae, meiotic dsb formation for meiotic recombination initiation requires the products of at least nine genes , in addition to that of the spo <dig> gene . however, many of these proteins are not conserved in other organisms. although mre <dig>  rad <dig> and xrs <dig> are respectively conserved in mammals as mre <dig>  rad <dig> and nbs <dig>  and in arabidopsis as atmre <dig>  atrad <dig> and atnbs <dig>  their corresponding proteins are not required for meiotic dsb formation  <cit> . instead, for meiotic dsb formation, arabidopsis requires prd <dig>  which appears to be an orthologue of mammalian mei <dig>  <cit> , while d. melanogaster requires mei-p <dig>  <cit> , which has no homologue in other eukaryotes. these observations suggested that higher eukaryotes and yeasts differ in their activation control of meiotic dsb formation and in their protein requirements for spo <dig> to express its dsb-forming activity.

genetic studies demonstrated the activity of spo <dig> to generate meiotic dsbs, but the biochemical function of spo <dig> is essentially unknown. we previously isolated a soluble form of atspo11- <dig>  with a dna binding activity that functions in meiosis  <cit> , and other plant spo11s . however, the dsb-forming activities of atspo <dig> alone, with or without an attached tag, and of the complex of atspo <dig> with a protein  required for spo11-dependent dsb formation have not been detected in vitro  <cit> . the inability to detect the dsb-forming activities of spo <dig> in vitro may simply be due to the in vitro conditions chosen for the tests, the improper folding and absence of eukaryote-specific posttranslational modifications of the protein expressed within bacterial cells, the unsuccessful multimer formation, or the absence of required spo11-interacting proteins.

to overcome these difficulties in determining whether spo <dig> by itself has dsb-forming activity and which plant spo <dig> candidates function in dsb formation for meiotic recombination initiation, we tried to develop an in situ assay for dsbs, by expressing a plant spo <dig> in eukaryotic cells. we chose the fruit-fly, drosophila melanogaster, in which the expressed proteins would be folded and modified under the in vivo conditions of eukaryotic cells and the chromatin is loosened during meiosis to allow the access of spo <dig> to the canonical dsb sites in chromosomal dna  <cit> . in addition, many well-established cytological and genetic techniques are available for drosophila. the dsbs generated by the plant spo <dig> were detected by in situ immunostaining, using an antibody that recognizes drosophila phosphorylated histone h2av . h2av is the sole drosophila h2a variant and the functional homolog of human h2ax. the phosphorylated form of h2av accumulates at dsb sites in drosophila  <cit> , as in mammals  <cit> . genetic analyses of the consequences of the ectopic expression of plant spo11s in drosophila would provide further support for their dsb-forming activities.

here, we report quantitative analyses of the dsb-forming activities of plant spo11s in the absence of plant spo11-interacting proteins in drosophila oocytes, as a bioassay system. the dsb formation in the oocytes was further confirmed by measuring the meiotic loss of the x chromosome, which was expected as the result of abortive dsb formation in meiosis, in the absence of authentic spo <dig>  in addition, using these assays, we tested three candidates of meiotic spo <dig> in rice, and identified a novel spo <dig> homologue, osspo11d, which possesses dsb-forming activity and is expressed specifically in meiotic tissue.

RESULTS
detection of dsb signals induced by plant spo11s expressed in drosophila oocytes
since a biochemical assay was not available, in order to address the questions of whether spo <dig> has dna cleavage activity by itself and which rice spo <dig> candidates function in dsb formation for rice meiotic recombination, at first we tested the rice spo <dig> homologues, osspo11a osspo11b and osspo11c, which phylogenetically correlate with atspo11- <dig>  atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> , respectively , and the novel fourth homologue, along with the arabidopsis spo <dig> homologues, atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  for the heterospecific complementation of the reduced fertility of the arabidopsis spo11- <dig> mutant. only atspo11- <dig> complemented the deficiency of the mutant. these negative results and the advantages of the drosophila systems as described prompted us to test drosophila meiotic recombination mutants, to address the above questions.

a cytological technique to detect dsbs is available in drosophila, by the use of an antibody against a phosphorylated human histone h2a variant, γ-h2ax, in which serine  <dig> is phosphorylated upon dsb formation  <cit> . the anti-human γ-h2ax antibody recognizes γ-h2av, the phosphorylated drosophila histone h2a variant, h2av, which is phosphorylated after dsb formation induced either exogenously or during meiosis  <cit> . this technique revealed that in wild type drosophila, dmspo <dig> -dependent dsbs appeared transiently in region 2b of the germarium, in which the γ-h2av signals overlap with the chromosomal dna signals and disappear in region  <dig>  . in postmeiotic nuclei of stage  <dig> or later egg chambers, the chromosomes are condensed to form a compact karyosome.

in yeast, unrepaired spo11-dependent meiotic dsbs reportedly accumulated in dsb-repair defective mutants, such as rad50s, and the dsb-repair defective mutants facilitated the sensitive mapping and reliable quantification of the spo11-dependent meiotic dsb formation  <cit> . in dsb-repair deficient mutant flies , such as mus <dig>  spn-a , spn-b  and okr , unrepaired meiotic dsbs accumulate and persist in the oocyte nuclei of the stages beyond the germarium region 2b of ovaries  <cit> , and cause defective karyosome morphology  in stage  <dig> or later egg chambers  <cit> . thus, this dsb-repair defective phenotype provides a sensitive and reliable measure of spo11-dependent meiotic dsbs.

in our positive control experiment, mei-w <dig> heterozygous  and mus <dig> hemizygous  flies showed the extensive accumulation of γ-h2av signals in almost all oocyte nuclei at stage 2- <dig> egg chambers, and defective karyosome morphology in most oocyte nuclei at stage 3- <dig> egg chambers . the γ-h2av signals in the oocyte nuclei were red outside the partially compact karyosome, and some yellow signals  were present in a tiny area within the stained dna  area . this slight overlap of the dsb signals and the major dna signals was previously reported: while the normal karyosome in dna repair-proficient oocytes is condensed in stage  <dig> or later and visualized by nuclear staining , in the oocyte nuclei of the dsb repair-deficient mutant spn-a, a rad <dig> paralogue, the unrepaired dna is dispersed and not visible by nuclear staining, except for a tiny overlapping region . however, the unrepaired dsbs were recognized by the anti-γ-h2ax antibody  as γ-h2av foci outside the partially condensed karyosome, where the unrepaired chromosomal dna is dispersed in the nuclei  <cit> .

in the negative control experiment, only small fractions of the oocyte nuclei of the mei-w <dig> homozygous and mus <dig> hemizygous flies without the transgene showed dsb signals and defective karyosome morphology . when the dmspo <dig> transgene was expressed under the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter in the mei-w <dig>  mus <dig> double mutant flies, almost all of the oocyte nuclei showed the extensive accumulation of γ-h2av signals, as in the case of the positive control , and the defective karyosome morphology . thus, we are confident that the γ-h2av signals in the postmeiotic nuclei of fly oocytes represent the dsbs formed by spo <dig> 

we then attempted to detect the dsbs induced by a plant spo <dig>  expressed in drosophila mei-w <dig> homozygous  and mus <dig> hemizygous  double mutant female flies, by an immuno-assay for phosphorylated histone h2av , and by monitoring the number of oocyte nuclei with defective karyosome morphology. the atspo11- <dig> or atspo11- <dig> transgene was expressed under the control of the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter in the mei-w <dig>  mus <dig> double mutant flies. both atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> are required for meiotic recombination in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, we were surprised to find that the expression of either atspo11- <dig> or atspo11- <dig> significantly increased both kinds of dsb signals in flies, the frequency of γ-h2av signals and the defective karyosome morphology, as compared with the negative control without the transgene . these results indicated that both atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> have the ability to induce dsbs, without the coexpression of other plant proteins, in drosophila oocyte nuclei.

to confirm the expression of transgenes in drosophila oocytes, we performed a quantitative rt-pcr analysis. the expression levels of the transgenes were higher than that of the drosophila ribosomal protein  <dig>  gene in drosophila oocytes .

* the amount of mrna from each copy of the plant spo <dig> transgene in drosophila ovaries was normalized by the amount of mrna from the rp <dig> gene. the average value with sd for each of the relative levels of transcripts was obtained from three samples, each containing 5~ <dig> ovaries.

analyses of disjunction in drosophila mei-w <dig> -deficient mutants expressing the spo <dig> transgene
in order to confirm that the expressed plant spo <dig> alone introduced dsbs in the chromosomes of drosophila oocyte nuclei, we examined the profiles of x chromosome disjunction caused by mei-w <dig>  deficiency in the drosophila dsb-repair proficient  background, assuming that the unrepaired dsbs caused the x chromosome loss, and the dsbs formed by the plant spo <dig> restored the normal x chromosome disjunction in the dmspo11-deficient background.

the recessive null mutation of mei-w <dig>  causes female sterility associated with a high frequency of chromosome nondisjunction in meiosis i, since the crossing-over type of homologous recombination induced by spo <dig> is essential for chiasma formation   <cit> . thus, during meiosis i in mutant cells devoid of meiotic recombination, in half of the cases, one daughter cell receives both paired chromosomes, and the other has none . drosophila mei-w <dig> heterozygous  mus301-proficient females displayed 88% fertility, and in contrast, mei-w <dig> homozygous  mus301-proficient females exhibited 26% fertility . the ubiquitous transcription of the mei-w68+ cdna by the hsp <dig> promoter complemented the reduced fertility of the mei-w <dig>  homozygotes . however, the expression of the plant spo <dig> cdnas by the same promoter never rescued it , and thus the dsbs introduced by a plant spo <dig> in drosophila are somehow different from those introduced by the host spo <dig>  mei-w <dig> . as mentioned in the introduction, the spo <dig> protein requires various species-specific interacting proteins for its meiotic function. thus, it was expected that the expressed plant spo11s, without their specific interacting proteins in drosophila, would be unable to complement the meiotic defects due to the mei-w <dig>  mutation .

in meiotic recombination-defective mutants, the nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes in meiosis will theoretically generate an equal number of nullo-x eggs and diplo-x eggs . a nullo-x egg fertilized with a single x sperm produces a special progeny called an x <dig> son, and a diplo-x egg fertilized with a single y sperm produces a progeny called an xxy daughter, when tested females are crossed with normal males with xy chromosomes. the cross of the mei-w <dig> homozygous females without the transgene to wild-type males produced progeny that included  <dig> % x <dig> sons, reflecting the proportion of nullo-x eggs to total fertile eggs, and  <dig> % xxy daughters, reflecting the proportion of diplo-x eggs to total fertile eggs . we interpreted this disparity in the proportion of nullo-x eggs to diplo-x eggs to be the outcome of x chromosome loss caused by spontaneously generated dsbs, occurring with inappropriate timing relative to the progression of meiosis. this interpretation is consistent with the  <dig> % background level of dsb signals in mei-w <dig> homozygotes with mus <dig> dsb-repair defects. it is further supported by the fact that the x-ray irradiation of cells at meiosis efficiently rescued the crossing-over defect and the homologous chromosome nondisjunction in mei-w <dig> female flies, while the irradiation of the premeiotic and postmeiotic cells did neither  <cit> .

the expression of atspo11- <dig> significantly increased x-chromosome loss, as observed by an increase in nullo-x eggs without associated diplo-x eggs . the expression of atspo11- <dig> increased it slightly . these results support the conclusion obtained from the above cytological assays that the expression of either atspo11- <dig> or atspo11- <dig> actually induces dsbs in the x-chromosomes of oocytes in the absence of functional dmspo <dig> in drosophila, but the induced dsbs are not repaired by the normal recombination required for chiasma formation. the dsb forming activity of atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  as shown by cytological and genetic means, was independent of other plant proteins, such as arabidopsis prd <dig>  indicating that atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> express the dsb forming activity either by themselves or with the use of functional drosophila analogues of other plant proteins.

identification of a novel spo11-homologue
since the bioassay for dsb induction by an expressed spo <dig> transgene successfully detected the dsb-forming activities of atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  we then tried to identify the spo11s that function in dsb formation in the rice o. sativa. candidates of rice spo11-homologues were cloned from a cdna library, constructed from rna isolated from anthers containing meiotic pollens of japonica rice, nipponbare . osspo11a, osspo11b and osspo11c are almost the same as ostop6a, ostop6b and ostop6c, respectively, of indica rice  <cit> . the fourth rice spo11-homologue, ak <dig>  was found by a homologous sequence search of the database of full-length cdna clones from japonica rice, kome , using the amino acid sequence of atspo11- <dig>  and consists of  <dig> amino acid residues.

we constructed the full-length cdnas of all rice spo <dig> candidates from the cloned cdna fragments . consistent with osspo11a, osspo11b and osspo11c, the amino acid sequence derived from the fourth spo11-homologue contained all five conserved motifs of spo <dig>  as well as the conserved tyrosine  that is assumed to be essential for the dsb-forming activity in the first motif   <cit> . the dxd sequence in motif v, which is proposed to coordinate a mg2+ cation  <cit> , is also conserved in the fourth spo11-homologue. thus, we tentatively named the fourth spo11-homologue osspo11d . while osspo11a, osspo11b and osspo11c are very likely to correspond to atspo11- <dig>  atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  respectively, with similarities of 58%, 63% and 69%, osspo11d has no arabidopsis counterpart, since it shows low similarity to the arabidopsis spo11s , and a blast search revealed no similar gene among the genomes of other plants, including sorghum  <cit>  and brachypodium  <cit> , which are both phylogenetically much closer to rice than arabidopsis. thus, spo11d is unique to rice.

osspo11d is expressed in anthers containing meiotic pollen mother cells
we then examined the expression of the rice genes encoding spo11-homologues at the mrna level, in anthers containing different developmental stages of pollens, from meiotic to mature pollens, as well as in leaves and roots, by the use of quantitative real-time rt-pcr. in rice, the distance between the auricles of the last two leaves  correlates well with the developmental stage of pollens. the panicle in the  <dig> cm dall  contains the majority of pollen mother cells at meiosis  <cit> . the panicle in the  <dig> cm dall , which is almost two days before heading, contains the mature pollens. the flowers at the bb stage  are one day before blooming. the panicles in the  <dig> cm dall  and  <dig> cm dall  contain immature to young mature pollens. we isolated the anthers from nipponbare panicles at the different stages according to the dall size, and analyzed the expression of the four genes. the results are shown in figure  <dig> 

the expression patterns of osspo11a and osspo11b were very similar to each other and rather different from those expected from their meiosis-specific functions; i.e., the osspo11a and osspo11b genes showed lower and constant levels  of expression in the anthers containing pollens of all stages , from meiosis to mature pollen, than osspo11c and osspo11d, although their expression levels were higher than those in the somatic cells, such as leaves and roots. the expression of osspo11a and osspo11b was induced to a 3- <dig> fold higher level  only at the bb stage, as compared to the other stages of pollen development.

the amounts of osspo11c mrna during pollen development from meiosis to the mature pollen stage were within  <dig> -fold of that in leaves, and tended to decrease through pollen development, but were generally  higher than those of the other spo <dig> genes, except for osspo11d. these osspo11c expression profiles suggest that it might be expressed in the somatic cells of leaves and anthers.

on the other hand, the expression pattern of the osspo11d mrna resembled those of genes that are specifically expressed in meiosis; i.e., the amount of osspo11d mrna increased to a much higher level  in the anthers containing meiotic pollens at the  <dig> cm dall , and subsequently decreased. in the anthers containing meiotic pollens, the amount of osspo11d mrna was the highest among the osspo <dig> genes; i.e., the amount was 4-6-fold higher than those of osspo11a and osspo11b . these results support the proposal that, unlike the other osspo <dig> homologues, the transcription of osspo11d is induced specifically and transiently in the meiotic stage of pollen development, suggesting that osspo11d plays an important role in rice meiosis.

osspo11d has dsb-forming activity, as detected by the drosophila bioassay
to investigate whether osspo11d, osspo11a and osspo11b can induce dsbs, we measured the dsb forming activity by each of their transgenes, expressed under the control of the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter, in the mei-w <dig>  mus <dig>  double mutant flies. the expression of osspo11d in the flies generated large numbers of oocyte nuclei with both kinds of dsb signals, the γ-h2av signals and the defective karyosome morphology . in order to confirm that osspo11d directly introduced dsbs in drosophila oocytes, we expressed a mutant transgene, osspo11dy213f, with the phenylalanine-substitution of the 213th tyrosine in the putative catalytic center, under the control of the drosophila hsp <dig> promoter. the osspo11dy213f transgenes were expressed at a similar level as the wild-type osspo11d transgene , but never showed any additional dsb activity over the background level, in terms of dsb signals  and karyosome morphology . thus, we conclude that osspo11d has intrinsic dsb-forming activity.

the expression of osspo11a in flies generated almost the same levels of dsb signals and defective karyosomes as atspo11- <dig> . on the other hand, the expression of osspo11b in flies did not generate any significant differences in the dsb signals and karyosome morphology over the negative control , unlike the case of its arabidopsis counterpart, atspo11- <dig> . in addition, the co-expression of osspo11a and osspo11b in flies showed no additive or synergistic effect on the generation of dsb-signals in fly oocytes . these results indicate that osspo11a and osspo11d have the ability to induce dsbs without the coexpression of other plant proteins in drosophila oocytes.

to confirm the dsb activity of osspo11d in drosophila, the nondisjunction test was performed. the expression of osspo11d in the mei-w <dig> homozygous  mus301-proficient flies increased the proportion of nullo-x eggs without associated diplo-x eggs by  <dig> % from the control level . the catalytic mutant transgene of osspo11d showed no increase in the proportion of nullo-x eggs without associated diplo-x eggs . from these results, we conclude that osspo11d, like atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  has dsb forming activity.

finally, to test whether the osspo11d-induced dsbs are repairable, we examined the dsb signals in mei-w68-deficient, but mus301-proficient, flies with the osspo11d transgene under hsp <dig> promoter control . among  <dig> oocyte nuclei , only  <dig> nuclei showed γ-h2av signals, and no defective karyosomes  were observed , suggesting that the osspo11d-induced dsbs are joined by a dsb-repair mechanism that does not allow chiasma formation.

discussion
plants have multiple functional spo <dig> candidates , and the spo <dig> candidate responsible for meiotic dsb formation has not been identified. to answer this question, we developed a drosophila bioassay for the quantitative evaluation of the dsb activity of spo <dig> candidates expressed from transgenes in fly oocytes. the interspecies bioassay that we developed in this study was effective to detect the dsb signals generated by the trans-expression of spo11s and to identify the spo11s with dsb-forming activities, among the candidates in plants. it was shown for the first time that both atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> exhibit dsb activity alone, in the absence of species-specific  interacting proteins for spo <dig> functions. arabidopsis has three genes encoding spo <dig> homologues. two of them  are required for meiosis. our results are surprising, since previous genetic studies showed that both atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> are required for meiosis, and interacting proteins, such as prd <dig>  are required for the spo <dig> functions . note that our results do not mean that atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> work independently in arabidopsis. it is likely that in arabidopsis, spo11-interacting proteins coordinate atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> to induce functional meiotic dsbs, leading to chiasma formation.

by using this method, we further investigated the three rice spo <dig> homologues and a novel one, osspo11d. osspo11a and osspo11b are considered as the counterparts of arabidopsis atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  respectively, from their amino acid-sequence similarities. the bioassay revealed that osspo11a has dsb activity, as in the case of its arabidopsis counterpart . however, we obtained another unexpected result from other tests: our assay did not detect any significant dsb-forming activity of osspo11b, unlike the case of its arabidopsis counterpart, atspo11- <dig> . this was surprising, since osspo11b was expressed in the fly at a similar level as osspo11a, and at two- to five-fold higher levels than atspo11- <dig>  atspo11- <dig> and osspo11d, which all showed dsb signals in the oocyte nuclei . this observation does not support the suggestion from the phylogenetic analyses  that osspo11b is an orthologue of atspo11- <dig>  osspo11d displayed robust dsb activity .

all of the results obtained from the analysis of the γ-h2av signals were supported in parallel by the analysis of the frequencies of oocyte nuclei with defective karyosome morphology in the dsb-repair defective fly, which represent the ectopically expressed plant spo11-induced dsbs in drosophila oocyte nuclei .

in order to obtain additional evidence for the dsb activity of spo11s, we performed genetic tests, using the dmspo11-deficient, but mus301-proficient , flies. we assumed that if the dsbs induced by a plant spo <dig> are not repaired, then the dsbs caused the x chromosome loss in drosophila oocytes, and if they are repaired by a normal recombination process leading to chiasma formation, then the dsbs restored the normal meiotic x chromosome disjunction. the expression of dmspo <dig> from the transgene fully restored the meiotic deficiencies of the dmspo <dig> mutant flies . the expression of the rice spo <dig> transgenes, as well as the arabidopsis spo11s, in oocytes bearing the dmspo <dig> mutation caused an increase in nullo-x eggs, without associated diplo-x eggs . the aberrant x-chromosome segregation, which was induced by the expression of the osspo11d, atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> transgenes in dmspo <dig> mutant flies, correlated well with the abilities of the expressed osspo11d, atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig> proteins to induce dsbs, as shown by the γ-h2av signals in the oocyte nuclei of the dmspo <dig> mus <dig> double mutant flies . this profile is explained by the x chromosome abnormalities caused by aberrant dsbs, as shown in figure 3c. therefore, we conclude that osspo11d, as well as atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  has dsb activity in oocytes.

then, one may wonder why the dsbs induced by the plant spo11s did not complement the meiotic defect of the dmspo <dig> mutant flies. the importance of the timing of dsb formation in meiotic disjunction was clearly shown by bhagat et al.  <cit> : x-ray irradiation of prophase i oocytes of dmspo11-deficient mutant flies efficiently induced meiotic exchanges and suppressed meiotic nondisjunction of the mutant flies. however, pre-meiotic or post-meiotic irradiation did not induce meiotic exchange and caused more severe nondisjunction in the mutants. the s. cerevisiae spo <dig> protein, expressed by the ubiquitous adh <dig> promoter in the host, exhibited dsb activity only in meiotic cells  <cit> . in addition, the dsb activity of spo <dig> required meiosis-specific and meiosis-nonspecific interactors  <cit> . these findings indicated the presence of regulatory factors for spo <dig> to exhibit the proper timing of the dsb activity. in this study, we found that dmspo <dig>  expressed by the ubiquitous hsp <dig> promoter in the drosophila dmspo <dig> mutant, allowed normal progression through meiosis. this suggested that, in drosophila, a regulator conferring the stage specificity of dmspo11-induced dsb formation prevents the dna scission by the dmspo <dig> protein in the premeiotic or postmeiotic stage, but in early pachynema, another regulatory factor induces the active form of the dmspo <dig> complex, leading to dsb formation for crossing-over. it is likely that the drosophila regulatory factors are unable to regulate the arabidopsis spo11s. thus, the dsb induction by plant spo11s, expressed by the ubiquitous promoter hsp <dig> in the absence of plant spo11-interacting protein factors, is unregulated and causes untimely dsbs in drosophila oocytes. the dsbs induced at inappropriate times are repaired in the mus301-proficient fly as described, probably through inter-sister chromatid-homologous recombination or non-homologous end-joining, rather than inter-homologous chromosome-recombination, which is required for chiasma formation.

a recent paper reported that rna interference for osspo11d  reduced pollen viability and seed setting rates in rice  <cit> . our finding of the specific expression of osspo11d at the transcriptional level in the anthers containing meiotic pollens  further strengthens the specific role of osspo11d in meiotic recombination, as in the case of spo <dig> in the yeast s. cerevisiae, which is expressed specifically at meiosis i under strict transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

more studies on osspo11d are necessary to prove this hypothesis. the bioassay described in this study would also be helpful to identify species-specific spo11-interacting proteins that stimulate the spo <dig> functions, the dsb forming activity specific for prophase i pachytene chromosomes, and the following interactions with repair enzymes. the biochemical characterization of purified spo11s is necessary. we purified atspo11- <dig>  <cit> , and other plant spo11s  in soluble forms, but they lacked detectable endonuclease activity. a recent report claimed that osspo11d exhibited dsb forming activity by itself in vitro  <cit> . further studies are needed to determine whether the purified spo11s introduce the dsbs with either site- or sequence-specificity and are attached covalently at the termini of the cleavage sites, and which amino acid substitutions inactivate the spo11s.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that, in the absence of other plant proteins, the arabidopsis spo11s required for meiosis, atspo11- <dig> and atspo11- <dig>  and the rice atspo11- <dig> counterpart, osspo11a, exert the dsb activities by themselves or with the use of drosophila functional analogues of other plant proteins. the drosophila bioassay revealed a novel rice spo <dig> homologue, osspo11d, which was suggested to be a functional spo <dig> in rice meiosis, along with osspo11a.
