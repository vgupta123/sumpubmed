BACKGROUND
chlorinated ethene congeners  are among the most frequently detected groundwater contaminants in the united states of america and other industrialized countries  <cit> . chloroethenes are often incompletely dechlorinated by bacteria in these anoxic environments, leading to an accumulation of vinyl chloride, a group  <dig> human carcinogen  <cit> . growth-linked reductive dechlorination of vinyl chloride is critical to avoid its accumulation and achieve in situ remediation of chloroethenes  <cit> , but vinyl chloride respiration has only been observed in certain strains of dehalococcoides  <cit> . dehalococcoides is a genus-level phylogenetic group within the chlorofiexi phylum  <cit> . dehalococcoides are strictly anaerobic bacteria that gain metabolic energy exclusively via the oxidation of h <dig> coupled to the reduction of organohalide compounds  <cit> . this catabolic reductive dehalogenation of organohalide compounds  is catalyzed in dehalococcoides by heterodimeric, membrane-bound enzymes called "reductive dehalogenases"  <cit> . reductive dehalogenases typically contain corrinoid and iron-sulfur clusters as cofactors, and have varied substrate ranges that do not necessarily overlap  <cit> .

the catalytic subunit of reductive dehalogenases is encoded in dehalococcoides by reductive dehalogenase homologous genes . dehalococcoides possess as many as  <dig> rdha per genome  <cit> , but few of the encoded enzymes, rdha, have been purified and characterized in vitro. many rdha are co-expressed  <cit> , further confounding a determination of the rdha responsible for catalysis of an observed reductive dehalogenation activity. the only reductive dehalogenase shown to catabolically reduce vinyl chloride, vcra, was purified from a highly-enriched vinyl chloride respiring culture dominated by dehalococcoides strain vs  <cit> . the operon encoding vcra, vcrabc, was identified by reverse genetics, and highly-similar vcra were detected in other vinyl chloride respiring dehalococcoides cultures  <cit> . primers targeting vcra are now commonly used as an indicator of attenuation potential at vinyl chloride contaminated sites . a putative vc reductase operon, bvcab, shares only limited similarity with vcrab and is present in a different vc respiring dehalococcoides strain, bav <dig>  which does not contain vcrabc  <cit> .

although dehalococcoides are the only known microorganisms capable of vinyl chloride respiration, both vcra and bvca appear to be horizontally acquired  <cit> . both vcra and bvca have a highly unusual, low % codon bias that appears maladapted to dehalococcoides genomes  <cit> , and both are found within a low % "genomic island"   <cit>  that interrupts local gene synteny relative to other dehalococcoides strains. in strain vs, this vcrabc -containing genomic island  integrated at the ssra locus, and as a result is flanked by ssra and a  <dig> bp direct repeat of the ssra 3' end  <cit> . ssra is a single-copy gene essential in bacteria  <cit>  encoding transfer messenger rna , which plays a key role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis  <cit> . specific integration of genetic elements at ssra is also common across many bacterial phyla, and often results in a direct repeat at the genomic island boundary opposite the site of integration  <cit> . in addition to the vcr-gi, over a dozen ssra direct repeats were previously detected downstream of ssra in dehalococcoides, collocated with many strain-specific rdha in a region of high genomic variability between dehalococcoides strains  <cit> . to further understand the acquisition and dissemination of vcrabc, as well as the impact of ssra-specific integration on dehalococcoides genome dynamics, we determined the conserved features of dehalococcoides ssra-specific genomic islands  from all publicly available genomes and metagenomes of dehalococcoides cultures, including the recently-sequenced dehalococcoides strain gt  <cit>  and the metagenome sequences of the vinyl chloride respiring dehalococcoides enrichment cultures kb- <dig>  <cit>  and anas  <cit> . we also amplified and sequenced ssra-gis from the vinyl chloride respiring dehalococcoides enrichment cultures evanite   <cit> , pm  <cit> , wbc- <dig>  <cit> , and wl  <cit>  using primers designed to target either vcr-gis specifically, or conserved features present in all available dehalococcoides ssra-gis. previous studies have implicated a subset of rdhab with horizontal gene acquisition, but evidence for the method of integration, mobilization, replication, and transfer is limited  <cit> . we describe here a family of putative ssra-specific integrative and mobilizable elements  <cit>  that share a conserved 'integration module' while also encoding a broad variety of putative and unknown functions, including reductive dehalogenation. the key conserved integrase encoded on these elements is a homolog of the ccrb family of site-specific serine recombinases that specifically integrate/excise the methicillin-resistance element "sccmec" in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . using a robust whole-genome phylogeny and several estimates for mutation rate, we estimate the age of the most recent common ancestor of contemporary dehalococcoides strains, as well as the age of divergence for dehalococcoides ssra-gi integration module components.

RESULTS
ssra genomic islands in dehalococcoides
the region downstream of ssra in available dehalococcoides genome sequences contains multiple tandem genomic islands that are primarily distinguished by their boundaries - ssra or its  <dig> bp direct repeat - as well as disruption to local gene synteny and in many cases the presence of a characteristic cluster of integration-associated genes adjacent to the left edge . all direct repeats are located within  <dig> kbp downstream of ssra, with varying numbers per strain and no duplicate genomic islands within any strain. these findings are consistent with ssra-specific integration described for other bacteria  <cit> , as well as a class of integrating and mobilizing elements that encode their own specific integration but do not replicate independently from the chromosome nor encode for conjugation  <cit> . from available dehalococcoides genomic data  we have detected a total of  <dig> ssra-gis containing  <dig> rdha,  <dig> hypothetical protein encoding genes,  <dig> putative complete crispr modules and arrays  <cit> , as well as other genes; most of which are not believed to encode a core function and are present in only a subset of dehalococcoides strains.

sixteen of the identified dehalococcoides ssra-gis contain an integration module comprised of  <dig> syntenic protein encoding genes oriented on the reverse strand and located adjacent to attl .

beginning from attl, the integration module contains genes that appear to encode  a  <dig> residue serine recombinase family putative site-specific integrase we call dehalococcoides ssra-specific integrase, dsib ;  a smaller  pinr  homolog that also contains a serine recombinase catalytic domain , dsia;  a small  recf homolog likely involved in dna recombination or repair  <cit> ,  a  <dig> residue protein with parbc domain, possibly catalyzing single-stranded dna cleavage, circular element nicking, element segregation ;  a mom  <cit>  homolog , predicted to play a role in restriction endonuclease resistance via methylation  <cit> ; and  a large  protein containing a dna-directed rna polymerase domain in the first  <dig> residues . these integration modules also contain a  <dig> bp conserved trna-like locus embedded within the first  <dig> bp of the fifth protein encoding gene, approximately  <dig> bp from attl . it is usually labeled as 'pseudo-trna' by automated annotation pipelines, but alignment-based rna folding analysis predicts a complete trna-gly-like structure . the elevated sequence conservation at its 3' end provides an effective target for primers, as do the regions surrounding ssra direct repeats and a site of locally high nucleotide conservation within dsib .

alignment of the ~ <dig> bp surrounding each of the  <dig> ssra direct repeats reveals additional nucleotide conservation and allows identification of the site of insertion in ssra . a  <dig> bp motif  occurs adjacent upstream of the direct repeat and does not align well with the corresponding positions in dehalococcoides ssra , indicating that insertion likely occurs between  <dig> and  <dig> in ssra. this location corresponds to the middle of the t-loop of the encoded tmrna, between the canonical insertion positions called 'sublocations ii and iii'  <cit>  .

specific features of vcr-gis
vcr-gis are a distinct subset of dehalococcoides ssra-specific genomic islands, present in two dehalococcoides genomes  and two metagenomes . using primers that target conserved features of all ssra-gis or specific features of vcrabc, we amplified and sequenced  <dig> additional vcr-gis from independently derived vinyl chloride respiring dehalococcoides enrichment cultures . in all instances the vcr-gi is located immediately adjacent to ssra, except strain gt where it is the second genomic island downstream of ssra. because ssra is an essential single-copy gene encoding a structural rna  <cit> , its sequence provides a coarse phylogenetic identity of the chromosome from which it was amplified  <cit> . this allowed confirmation that the vcr-gis acquired via metagenomic and targeted sequencing are dehalococcoides chromosomal segments, even though the source genomic dna was from a mixed culture .

these vcr-gis contain integration and cargo  modules with discordant evolutionary histories. the boundary between integration module and vcrabc is delineated by an unambiguous difference in nucleotide identity,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . this boundary reveals that vcr-gi integration modules contain a seventh protein encoding gene oriented in the opposite  direction encoding a rubredoxin domain protein, in addition to the  <dig> integration module genes described previously . these integration modules  are related as three distinct branches with nearly-identical leaves , grouped in a topology that is discordant with the corresponding tree of the  <dig> bp vcrabc cargo . relatedness of vcrabc -cargo sequences was estimated based on the  <dig> variant positions in their alignment, appearing mostly  in the form of substitutions in the leader sequence of vcra  <cit>  . ka/ks ratios for the vcra leader sequence  ranged between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  for different pairwise combinations  <cit>  and phylogenetic nodes  <cit> , suggesting this region is under purifying selection. by contrast, the ka/ks ratio for the remainder of vcra was incalculable because all  <dig> variant positions  were non-synonymous substitutions, suggesting recent positive selection on the mature vcra enzyme. this latter conclusion must be tempered by the limited information available in just  <dig> variant sites, the complete lack of indels detected in any vcra , as well as the clear influences of recent horizontal gene transfer and recombination on these vcr-gis. for example, vcrc is identical across all strains, within a  <dig> bp region of perfect identity.

age of dehalococcoides
a core-gene phylogenetic tree was constructed to support age estimates based on evolutionary models. the core-gene tree was built from  <dig> core orthologous protein encoding genes shared between available dehalococcoides genomes and dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens bl-dc- <dig>  a chlorofiexi strain that is a phylogenetic outgroup to dehalococcoides and its closest completely-sequenced relative  <cit> . age estimates depend heavily on the assumed rate of mutation. we iterated our calculations on multiple published mutation rates , as well as an empirical observation for mutation rate derived from the known divergence time  between the isolation of dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain  <dig>  <cit>  and the generation of a metagenome of its parent culture, donna <dig> . the latter empirical rate is substantially faster than the published values of faster-growing microbes , possibly because it includes mutations that already existed between strain variants within the donna <dig> culture prior to isolation of strain  <dig>  although we expect a long-term average mutation rate in the natural environment to be slower, and hence ages based on this rate to be an underestimate, it remains useful as a conservative bound on the 'recentness' of the events in question. similarly, we used a range of growth rates to estimate the age of dehalococcoides. for a recent bound we used the fastest reported dehalococcoides doubling time , as well as a range of slower reported growth rates from anaerobic environmental systems for more realistic estimates . the corresponding estimates and lower  bounds are presented in table  <dig> 

calculation
strain 195
reported age estimates  are based on the rate of evolution listed in the column header as well as the average dehalococcoides doubling time from published values . all estimates are reported in units of  <dig> million years. age estimates of the dehalococcoides clade from the splitstree consensus network are based on branch lengths of strains to the common network node. '16s clock' is based on 1-2% 16s rrna gene divergence per  <dig> million years  <cit> . values in parenthesis are results from different doubling time estimates:  <dig>  days - the fastest reported doubling time for dehalococcoides  <cit> ;  <dig>  days - anaerobic benthic sediment community doubling time  <cit> ;  <dig>  days - bacterial doubling time in anaerobic seawater  <cit> ;  <dig> days - approximate doubling time of the strictly anaerobic annamox bacteria  <cit> . for the secondary calculations of age estimates, an extra significant digit has been reported to allow distinguishing of estimates.

in relative terms, the divergence of dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas are comparable to the predicted most recent common ancestor  of available integration modules, approximately an order of magnitude earlier than the mrca of dehalococcoides strains. the mrca of vcr-gi integration modules also significantly precedes the divergence of contemporary dehalococcoides strains. in contrast, the high similarity among vcrabc sequences results in an estimated age that is at least an order of magnitude younger than dehalococcoides speciation .

discussion
age and specific features of vcrabc acquisition
nucleotide similarity is significantly higher between vcrabc cargo modules than can be expected if it was an orthologous locus present in the dehalococcoides common ancestor . in all cases vcrabc is located within a syntenic putatively-mobile element, vcr-gi, that is part of a broader class of ssra-specific mobile elements that appear to be common among dehalococcoides. in all vcrabc -containing strains except gt, the vcr-gi is located adjacent to the primary site of integration, ssra, structural evidence that vcr-gis are among the most recently integrated of the available dehalococcoides ssra-gis. within phylogenetic branches, integration modules are perfectly identical, except for a large identical deletion in the ev and pm vcr-gis. the significantly unusual nucleotide signature of vcr-gis  <cit> , as well as the discordance between the vcra tree and the corresponding dehalococcoides strain phylogeny, indicate that vcrabc has not been stably maintained in dehalococcoides genomes since their divergence. taken together, these observations suggest recent horizontal acquisition and dissemination of vcrabc across all dehalococcoides ecotypes by way of a ssra-specific mobile element with conserved attachment site and integration module.

because anthropogenic release of chloroethenes into the environment is a relatively recent phenomenon , we are particularly interested in the recent bounds for estimates of the age of the mrca of these vcrabc sequences as a proxy for their horizontal acquisition by dehalococcoides. using our highest estimated rates of mutation and chromosomal replication, the divergence of these vcrabc sequences appears to have occurred  <dig> years ago. this value is in flated by the inexplicably high variation within the leader sequence of vcra. if we remove the vcra leader sequence from the calculation, the age of divergence decreases to  <dig> years. however, there is clear signal for positive selection in the remaining vcrab sequence alignment: all  <dig> variant positions  are predicted to result in amino acid substitutions. if positively selected, these mutations may have accumulated faster than the background rates assumed in our molecular dating calculations. because the relative increase in substitution rate is unclear and the total information represented by just  <dig> variant positions is low, we cannot confidently distinguish the divergence of these vcrabc from the first industrial production of chloroethenes. by contrast, our most conservative estimate for the mrca of contemporary dehalococcoides strains is  <dig>  years ago , long before industrial civilization had a chance to influence the evolution of dehalococcoides and their streamlined genomes specialized for organohalide respiration.

it is important to note that these molecular dating estimates use the available vcrabc sequences to predict the first horizontal acquisition of vcrabc by dehalococcoides. this analysis is not meant to predict the age of genesis of the first vinyl chloride reductase. we did not detect partial homology with other rdha that would suggest vcra is a chimera resulting from a recent homologous recombination event. moreover, the existence of an alternate vinyl chloride reductase from strain bav <dig>  bvca  <cit> , that shares deeply branching ancestry with vcra on a tree of available rdha  <cit> , suggests that vinyl chloride reductases have existed for a considerable period of time, just not within strains of dehalococcoides for which sequence data is currently available. in fact, naturally occurring vinyl chloride has been detected in soils  <cit> , providing a plausible source of selective pressure to explain the existence of vinyl chloride reductases in nature prior to human pollution. however, we have not identified any candidate lineages as the possible progenitor of vinyl chloride reductases, and we have no way of knowing whether the primary substrate for the ancestral vcra or bvca was consistently vinyl chloride, leaving their ancestral history unclear.

the phylogenetic discord between integration modules and their attached vcrabc indicates that homologous recombination - or perhaps a more directed form of 'module swapping' - has recently occurred between vcr-gis . this additional inter-element recombination may be independent of ssra-specific integration, but it would still require horizontal transfer so that  <dig> or more vcr-gis are collocated within the same cell. multiple vcr-gi variants have not been detected in the same complete genome. however, we did detect a low-coverage variant in the kb- <dig> metagenome assembly with  <dig> corroborating reads that perfectly match a different vcr-gi integration module found in vs, wl, gt, and wbc- <dig> cultures, providing preliminary evidence of the physical collocation of two vcr-gis within the kb- <dig> culture .

ssra-gis appear to be integrative and mobilizable elements
a subset of dehalococcoides rdhab were previously implicated in horizontal transfer  <cit> , including the trichloroethene reductase gene, tceab  <cit> . although the selective conditions in chloroethene-contaminated environments favors maintenance of tceab and vcrabc, the genes implicated in tceab transfer  <cit>  share no detectable homology with the ssra-specific system described in detail here. we hypothesize that these dehalococcoides ssra-gis behave as integrative and mobilizable elements  because they do not appear to encode conjugation, although they share many other features of the broadly defined class of integrative and conjugative elements   <cit> . it may be possible that conjugation is encoded by a surprisingly minimal gene set within the integration modules  <cit> , similar to the small  integrating and conjugating element 'psam2' of streptomyces ambofaciens, which requires only a single gene, trasa, for inter-mycelial  transfer  <cit> . dehalococcoides core genes do include putative pil genes, the functions of which are unclear but may play a role in conjugation. some strains of dehalococcoides contain unambiguous prophages, providing an alternative hypothesis for the mechanism of ssra-gi transfer, via illegitimate packaging of the excised ssra-gi into a phage capsule. the length of dehalococcoides ssra-gis is within the range of typical phage genomes. however, evidence for a complete prophage is not as ubiquitous among dehalococcoides as the presence of ssra-gis, and there have been no descriptions to date of dehalococcoides phage that also encode an rdha, leaving the influence of phage on rdha evolution unclear. based on currently available evidence, we hypothesize that dehalococcoides ssra-gis are mobilizable but not conjugating elements that sometimes mobilize adjacent tandem islands but in all cases rely on a host- or phage-encoded system for cell-cell transfer of a transient, presumably circular, intermediate.

dehalococcoides also contains comea, and it is unknown if dehalococcoides is transiently competent for uptake of exogenous dna. however, transfer via stochastic competence is an unsatisfying explanation, mainly because dehalococcoides ssra-gis appear to lack genes encoding independent replication, and stable non-phage extrachromosomal elements have not been observed in dehalococcoides  <cit> .

occasionally integrating and conjugating elements do have replicative forms  <cit> , as in the case of rolling circle replication of psam <dig> in the donor cell  <cit> . maphosa et al. recently described a field site in which there were  <dig> to  <dig> orders of magnitude more vcra copies detected than copies of tcea, bvca, or dehalococcoides 16s rrna genes  <cit> . vcra was also more abundant than dehalococcoides 16s rrna genes in a dechlorinating bioreactor inoculated from the site  <cit> , suggesting either  there exists a vcr-ime that can replicate independently or has integrated within an element that can replicate independently, or  they detected a non-dehalococcoides population that also possesses vcra, coexisting with a dehalococcoides population.

it is important to note that, while a conspicuous and common feature, not all dehalococcoides ssra-gis contain an integration module. we identified  <dig> ssra-gis without integration modules, containing a total of  <dig> rdha as well as other genes. these might be 'cis-mobilizable elements' that encode neither integration nor transfer, but retain functional attl/attr sites  <cit>  and are occasionally or constitutively mobilized with adjacent genomic islands through a process known as accretion  <cit> . in some cases these tandem ssra-gis may have been previously mobile but are now fixed in the chromosome. for example, there is a region immediately downstream of the direct repeats furthest from ssra that is similarly dense in rdha while also syntenic across dehalococcoides strains, phylogenetically coherent with whole genome estimates, and devoid of ssra-gi signatures ; suggesting this region was present in the mrca of available dehalococcoides  <cit> . some or all of this region may have been acquired originally as an ssra-gi, but deletion and amelioration has erased evidence of horizontal gene transfer.

likely roles within ssra-gi integration modules
the first identified dehalococcoides ssra-specific integrase gene   was sequenced following the original identification and characterization of vcra, and noted for its proximity to vcra on the chromosome  <cit> . it is now clear that dhcvs_ <dig> is part of an integration module in an adjacent downstream ssra-gi , one of  <dig> dsib homologs detected in dehalococcoides genome sequences. the closest relative to dsib in the public database is present on a fully-sequenced metagenomic fosmid from a deep  ocean subsurface sample , within an apparent integration module that also includes homologs to dsia, parb, mom, and a putative trna embedded in mom, as well as an unambiguous ssra-direct repeat at the homologous attl position embedded in dsib . this is especially intriguing in light of the recent sequencing of  <dig> novel rdha amplified from various marine subsurface sediments  <cit> , many of which appear phylogenetically within a major rdha branch  that is otherwise populated only by rdha from dehalococcoides or dehalogenimonas. given this indirect evidence and the large diversity of organohalogens detected in marine systems  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that dehalococcoides plays a role in these settings. however, in the absence of direct observation of dehalococcoides-like microorganisms in marine  settings, this role remains unclear.

a more sensitive database search indicated that dsib is a structurally similar homolog of ccrb, containing the serine-recombinase-catalytic domain at the n terminus, as well as similar motifs along its ~ <dig> residue length . ccrb specifically integrates/excises the so-called 'staphylococcus cassette chromosome'  family of mobile elements that are a vector of antimicrobial resistance , with major consequences for hospitals and the greater community  <cit> . ccrb was shown to have dna-binding and recombination activity for atts of scc  <cit> , but scc integration  <cit>  and attb-specific excision both required the product of a smaller, co-transcribed serine recombinase gene, ccra, that does not encode a dna-binding domain  <cit> . similarly, dehalococcoides integration modules encode on a putative operon a second, smaller serine recombinase, dsia, that also lacks a detectable dna-binding motif. dehalococcoides ssra-gis and scc also share overlapping size ranges and specifically integrate at a non-trna, single-copy essential gene. we hypothesize that integration/excision of dehalococcoides ssra-gis occurs in a homologous mechanism to scc, via dsib in concert with dsia, with other integration module elements likely playing a role in regulation of integrase/excisionase activity or modification of the excised element to facilitate transfer or maintenance. unfortunately, the mode of scc transfer among staphylococcus is unclear  <cit> , and so does not provide additional clues regarding a likely transfer mechanism.

interestingly, dsib is always found overlapping attl at its 3' end. a stop codon occurs only upstream of the genomic island, even if that means overlapping substantially with an adjacent genomic island or ssra itself. complimentary overlap of ssra with small open reading frames has been detected in some bacteria with ambiguous implications  <cit> . it seems unlikely in this instance that the 3' terminal ~ <dig> bp of ssra also encode a functional region of dsib on its complementary strand. accordingly, alignments of dsib are divergent at this portion of their sequence, both in length and amino acid similarity. the majority of dsib is upstream of ssra or its direct repeat, and already comprises the expected length for homologs of ccrb . in addition to a trivial explanation in which dsib undergoes low-efficiency translation that is variable at the c-terminus, it may be that dsib is only fully functional when encoded on the circularized element, or alternatively when encoded on the chromosome downstream of an adjacent genomic island containing the requisite 3' gene fragment. in any case, the overlap of dsib with attp/attl leaves the stop codon of dsib unclear, and may have functional relevance or affect regulation of dsib.

CONCLUSIONS
structural comparison of new genomic data, as well as targeted sequencing from unsequenced vinyl chloride respiring enrichment cultures, resulted in identification of  <dig> homologous mobile elements containing the vinyl chloride reductase operon, vcrabc. these vcr-gis are a subset of mobile genetic elements in dehalococcoides that specifically integrate at the single-copy gene, ssra. a detailed comparison of these ssra-gis allowed identification of the precise position of insertion, the direct repeat created by the insertion event, as well as a conserved module of syntenic integration-associated genes that includes the likely ssra-specific integrase, which we named dsib. ssra-gis are most likely 'integrating and mobilizable elements'  that do not encode their own mechanism of cellular transfer. core genome phylogenetic analysis allowed an estimation of timing of divergence of dehalococcoides strains, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years ago, suggesting that the specialization by dehalococcoides for respiration of organohalide compounds far precedes industrial synthesis by humans. by contrast, time estimates for the first horizontal acquisition of vcrabc sequences by dehalococcoides are not confidently distinguishable from the first industrial synthesis of chloroethenes ~ <dig> years ago. vinyl chloride reductases may be ancient, nevertheless, and the donor of recent genetic diversity to dehalococcoides remain undetermined.
