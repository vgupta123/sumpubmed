BACKGROUND
although molecular oxygen  is used as stable terminal electron acceptor in many essential metabolic processes, its partially reduced or activated forms, singlet oxygen , superoxide radical , hydrogen peroxide  and hydroxyl radical , are highly reactive  <cit> . overproduction of these reactive oxygen species  can initiate a variety of autooxidative chain reactions on membrane unsaturated fatty acids, thus yielding lipid hydroperoxides and cascades of events ultimately leading to destruction of organelles and macromolecules  <cit> .

in plants, ros are continuously produced as byproducts of various metabolic pathways, principally through electron transport chains in chloroplasts and mitochondria, photorespiration in peroxisomes, oxidases and peroxidases  <cit> . ros, which also act as signalling molecules, have been shown to affect the expression of multiple genes  <cit> , and to be involved in activation and control of various genetic stress-response programs  <cit> .

however, numerous environmental factors such as uv-radiation, high light, drought, low or high temperature, mechanical stress and some xenobiotics disturb the prooxidant-antioxidant balance and lead to irreparable metabolic dysfunctions and cell death  <cit> . different classes of herbicides are direct or indirect sources of oxidative damages in plants. the herbicide atrazine, of the triazine family, binds to the d <dig> protein, which results in inhibition of photosystem ii  by blocking electron transfer to the plastoquinone pool  <cit> , thus leading to production of triplet chlorophyll and 1o <dig>  <cit> .

because of widespread use, atrazine is a common contaminant in soils, streams, rivers and lakes  <cit> . the length of water residence time associated with high loading rates results in prolonged exposure of phytoplankton communities to atrazine. numerous studies have been carried out on the sensitivity of aquatic photosynthetic communities towards atrazine and on effects of this herbicide on reduction of photosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, cell growth and nitrogen fixation  <cit> . in the case of wild terrestrial plants, most studies deal with mutations of d <dig> protein in atrazine-resistant weeds  <cit> , rather than with atrazine-related toxic effects.

exogenous supply of soluble sugars, particularly sucrose, has been shown to confer to arabidopsis plantlets a high level of atrazine tolerance  <cit> . transcriptome profiling revealed that atrazine sensitivity and sucrose-induced atrazine tolerance were associated with important modifications of gene expression related to ros defence mechanisms, repair mechanisms, signal transduction and cellular communication  <cit> . thus, sucrose-induced atrazine tolerance was shown to depend on modifications of gene expression, which to a large extent resulted from combined effects of sucrose and atrazine. this strongly suggested important interactions of sucrose and xenobiotic signalling or of sucrose and ros signalling, thus resulting in induction of specific transcription factors and in an integrated response to changing environmental conditions  <cit> .

complex arrays of detoxification mechanisms have been selected in plants against ros accumulation and toxicity. biochemical antioxidants, such as ascorbate, glutathione, tocopherol, flavonoids, anthocyanins and carotenoids  <cit> , and ros-scavenging enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , glutathione peroxidase  and catalase   <cit> , are involved in maintaining the redox balance of cells. for example, transgenic plants with enhanced sod activity exhibit increased tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit> . moreover, ramel et al.  <cit>  have shown that, during sugar-induced protection against atrazine, expression of several ros defence-related genes was enhanced.

the present work analyses the relationships between ros patterns, expression of genes involved in synthesis of antioxidant molecules or antioxidative processes and respective enzyme activities in order to characterize atrazine sensitivity and sucrose-induced tolerance against atrazine-dependent oxidative stress. atrazine-treated plantlets were found to exhibit an original pattern of ros with increased levels of 1o <dig> and h2o <dig> associated with a decrease of o <dig> - content, whereas the protective sucrose-atrazine combination favored accumulation of o <dig> - and h2o <dig>  these ros patterns were associated with differences of antioxidant gene expression and enzyme activities, thus suggesting that atrazine injuries might be due to deficient ros-detoxification mechanisms. the possible interferences of sucrose, xenobiotic and ros signalling are discussed.

RESULTS
patterns of accumulation of singlet oxygen, superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide
the transfer of plantlets after  <dig> weeks of growth to control and treatment media, as described in methods, was designed to compare plantlets at the same developmental and physiological stages. as previously described in numerous studies of sugar effects in plants, mannitol treatment was used as osmotic control. moreover, we previously showed that the deleterious effects of atrazine on arabidopsis plantlets followed the same dose-response curve and the same time dependence in the absence or presence of  <dig> mm mannitol  <cit> . it was also verified that, in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , exogenous sugar treatment resulted in increased levels of endogenous soluble sugars in arabidopsis plantlets .

at the end of treatments, plantlets were specifically stained for singlet oxygen, superoxide radical, and hydrogen peroxide. hideg et al.  <cit>  described some limitations in the use of vacuum infiltration of ros probes and reagents with excised leaves or leaf segments from pea, spinach or tobacco. however, vacuum infiltration has been successfully used on whole arabidopsis thaliana plantlets under various experimental conditions  <cit> . moreover, under the conditions of the present work, whatever the dye used and therefore the ros detected, the non-stressed plantlets, transferred to  <dig> mm mannitol or  <dig> mm sucrose media, presented expected responses related to ros production . plantlets that were transferred for  <dig> h on mannitol medium presented the same ros levels as three-week-old plantlets prior to transfer .

detection and quantification of singlet oxygen  were performed with the specific singlet oxygen sensor green® reagent  <cit> . for atrazine-containing treatments , green fluorescence indicating primary events of 1o <dig> accumulation was detected in cotyledons as soon as after  <dig> hours of treatment . tolerance treatment  maintained a low level of 1o <dig> in cotyledons throughout the treatment, while atrazine treatment  strongly increased 1o <dig> production in cotyledons and leaves from  <dig> to  <dig> hours of treatment. the presence of sucrose in herbicide-containing medium thus appeared to prevent accumulation of 1o <dig> generated by atrazine.

superoxide radical  detection and quantification were performed using the nitroblue tetrazolium  staining method. the levels of superoxide radical staining after  <dig> hours of transfer  were quite similar in the absence  or presence  of  <dig> μm atrazine. however, the time-course revealed constant levels of o <dig> - in control plantlets , while a strong blue coloration appeared in plantlets treated with sucrose . this increase was more visible in young leaves. superoxide radical levels in atrazine-treated plantlets  decreased from  <dig> hours of treatment. the combination of sucrose plus atrazine  led to an intermediate state with slight coloration maintained in young leaves throughout the treatment. low levels of o <dig> -, relatively to the mannitol control, were also observed when a drop of  <dig> μm atrazine solution was directly applied to leaf tissue .

h2o <dig> detection and quantification were performed using the  <dig> '-diaminobenzidine  staining method  <cit> . polymerization of dab, visible as a brown precipitate in the presence of h2o <dig>  was detected under all conditions. no coloration was observed when infiltration was carried out in the presence of ascorbic acid, thus confirming the h2o <dig> specificity of dab staining, in accordance with previous reports  <cit> . figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> summarize the time-course of h2o <dig> accumulation. from  <dig> hours of transfer, control  and sucrose-treated  plantlets exhibited a much weaker level of h2o <dig> than plantlets of atrazine-containing treatments . no variation of h2o <dig> accumulation was detected in the presence of mannitol, whereas h2o <dig> content decreased in sucrose-treated plantlets. in contrast, atrazine in the absence or presence of sucrose tended to increase progressively h2o <dig> levels until  <dig> hours of treatment. this increase could be detected as early as the fourth hour of atrazine treatment . likewise, an immediate increase of h2o <dig> levels was also observed when a drop of  <dig> μm atrazine solution was directly applied to leaf tissue .

patterns of singlet oxygen quenching mechanisms
transcriptomic analysis showed that genes linked to the synthesis of 1o2-quenchers presented contrasted patterns of expression in relation to atrazine sensitivity and tolerance . some genes exhibited higher transcript levels under tolerance condition  and repression under atrazine injury condition , thus suggesting the possibility of more efficient quenching mechanisms in the presence of sucrose. thus, seven genes encoding thioredoxin family proteins  were characterized by significant atrazine repression of expression, which was lifted by sucrose-atrazine tolerance treatment . only two genes encoding thioredoxin family proteins exhibited higher expression under atrazine treatment  than under sucrose plus atrazine treatment . in contrast, two thioredoxin genes  and one thioredoxin reductase gene  were significantly induced under tolerance conditions  compared to atrazine treatment  . thioredoxins have been shown to be involved in supplying reducing power to reductases detoxifying lipid hydroperoxides or repairing oxidized proteins  <cit> . thioredoxins could also act as regulators of scavenging mechanisms  <cit>  and as components of signalling pathways of plant antioxidant network. finally, das and das  <cit>  presented evidence that human thioredoxin was a powerful 1o <dig> quencher, which could protect cells and tissues against oxidative stress.

relative expressions of gene are given with their log <dig> for sucrose versus mannitol , mannitol plus atrazine versus mannitol  and sucrose plus atrazine versus mannitol  comparison. nde: not differentially expressed. genes with a bonferroni p-value higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described by lurin et al.  <cit> .

another group of genes exhibited induction of expression under atrazine conditions, whereas they were less induced or not differentially expressed under sucrose-atrazine conditions. activation of these genes might reflect stress signalling due to high 1o <dig> content in atrazine treated-cells, as revealed by ros detection . some of these genes belonged to carotenoid biosynthesis pathways, such as zeta-carotene desaturase zds <dig> , beta-carotene hydroxylase  or 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase hpd  . carotenoids, which are known to act in chloroplasts as accessory pigments in light harvesting, can detoxify 1o <dig> and triplet chlorophyll and dissipate excess excitation energy  <cit> .

transcriptome profiling was carried out after  <dig> hours of treatment  <cit> . measurements of carotenoid levels at different times of treatment showed that modifications were most contrasted after  <dig> hours of treatment  <cit> . thus, given the potential delay between transcription and metabolic fluxes, modifications of carotenoid levels after  <dig> hours of treatment were compared with transcript-level modifications after  <dig> hours of treatment. carotenoid  levels in arabidopsis thaliana plantlets after  <dig> hours of treatment are presented in table  <dig>  atrazine treatment tended to reduce carotenoid contents, while addition of sucrose in presence of atrazine maintained carotenoid levels near control levels. however, carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios were not significantly different, thus indicating that the photoprotection role of carotenoids was maintained in the presence of atrazine.


higher induction by atrazine treatment was also found for the violaxanthin de-epoxidase precursor  gene, which is involved in the xanthophyll cycle . together with carotenoids, zeaxanthin, synthesized from violaxanthin via the xanthophyll cycle, protects chloroplasts by accepting excitation energy from singlet chlorophyll  <cit> . two genes involved in the shikimate  and terpenoid pathways , which are essential for tocopherol synthesis  <cit> , were also induced by the herbicide and not differentially expressed by the tolerance treatment  . the antioxidant tocopherol is known to scavenge oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxy radicals and 1o <dig>  <cit> . finally, the presence of atrazine alone was found to induce the at3g <dig> gene, which is involved in proline synthesis, with a higher intensity than under conditions of combination with sucrose . proline is also known to be an 1o <dig> quencher  <cit> .

patterns of superoxide radical scavenging mechanisms
excess of superoxide radical caused by numerous environmental stresses is detoxified by superoxide dismutase  enzymes and converted into h2o <dig>  seven isoenzymes have been identified, differing by their metal cofactor , in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . transcriptome profiling was carried out after  <dig> hours of treatment  <cit> . measurements of enzyme activities at different times of treatment showed that modifications were most contrasted after  <dig> hours of treatment . thus, given the potential delay between transcription and protein synthesis, modifications of global sod activities after  <dig> hours of treatment were compared with modifications of sod-encoding transcript levels after  <dig> hours of treatment.

sod activity  was decreased by atrazine treatment  in comparison to the mannitol control . in contrast, addition of sucrose in the presence of atrazine  maintained a functional level of sod activity equivalent to that of the mannitol control. since sucrose alone was found to increase sod activity, it thus seemed that sucrose might balance the negative effect of atrazine in the situation of sa treatment.

among the six isoenzyme-encoding genes represented in this microarray analysis , three exhibited significant variations of transcript levels in comparison with control conditions, thus suggesting their potential involvement in o <dig> --detoxifying processes in relation to atrazine sensitivity and tolerance. three genes, encoding csd <dig>  msd <dig>  fsd <dig>  were characterized by significant repression under conditions of atrazine treatment compared to control, in accordance with the measurement of global sod activity . the csd <dig> gene , encoding cytosolic cu-zn superoxide dismutase, exhibited an induction under tolerance conditions . in contrast, msd <dig>  and fsd <dig>  genes, which, respectively, encode mitochondrial and chloroplastic superoxide dismutases, were not differentially expressed in the presence of sucrose. exogenous sucrose, whether combined or not with atrazine, therefore re-established the basal level of transcripts  and of global activity , thus avoiding the repressive effects of the herbicide.

relative expressions of gene are given with their log <dig> for sucrose versus mannitol , mannitol plus atrazine versus mannitol  and sucrose plus atrazine versus mannitol  comparison. nde: not differentially expressed. genes with a bonferroni p-value higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described by lurin et al.  <cit> .

potential origin of hydrogen peroxide accumulation in the presence of atrazine
h2o <dig> contents in atrazine-treated plantlets in the presence or absence of sucrose seemed to be independent from o <dig> - dismutation. indeed, o <dig> - level was low in sucrose plus atrazine-treated plantlets and null in atrazine-treated plantlets. thus, atrazine, in the absence or presence of sucrose, may promote h2o2-producing pathways independently from o <dig> - and 1o <dig> accumulation. transcriptomic analysis revealed induction of two genes encoding h2o2-producing enzymes in atrazine-treated plantlets in the presence or absence of sucrose  : amine oxidase  and proline oxidase . moreover, other potentially h2o2-producing genes were upregulated either under ma condition: a glycolate oxidase putative gene  and a glyoxal oxidase-related gene ; or under sa condition: two genes encoding acyl-coa oxidases  .

patterns of hydrogen peroxide scavenging mechanisms
in order to investigate the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide scavenging mechanisms, global h2o2-scavenging enzyme activities and transcript levels of related genes were analysed. as explained above, modifications of enzyme activities after  <dig> hours of treatment were compared with modifications of transcript levels after  <dig> hours of treatment.

h2o <dig> can be principally scavenged by two different ways: ascorbate-glutathione cycles and catalases, which play important roles in plant defence and senescence. ascorbate-glutathione cycles are catalysed by a set of four enzymes: ascorbate peroxidase , monodehydroascorbate reductase , glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase , and glutathione reductase   <cit> .

the five enzymes belonging to h2o2-scavenging mechanisms presented two different profiles of global activity according to the different treatments. the majority of enzymes involved in ascorbate-glutathione cycles  were differentially affected by the different treatments. activity of these three enzymes was significantly reduced by addition of atrazine, while sucrose treatment had an opposite effect and significantly increased these activities . the tolerance condition  succeeded to limit repressive effects of the herbicide and maintained enzyme activities at the control level. the fourth enzyme of the ascorbate-glutathione cycles, gr, did not present any significant variation of activity between the different treatments . finally, catalase exhibited slightly lower activity under conditions of sucrose plus atrazine, when compared to control and atrazine-containing medium .

the repressive effect of atrazine in the absence of sucrose  on apx global activity was correlated with a general repression of apx genes . among the six apx genes present in the microarray, the cytosolic apx <dig> , the stromal sapx  and the chloroplastic apx <dig>  genes exhibited important decrease of transcript levels under conditions of atrazine treatment  compared to mannitol control, while the other apx genes were not differentially expressed in the presence of atrazine. whereas apx <dig> expression remained downregulated in the presence of sucrose plus atrazine, this tolerant condition balanced the repressive effects of atrazine for apx <dig> and sapx genes, which recovered a level of transcript similar to the control. finally, and in contrast with global apx activity, the thylakoid-bound tapx  gene was not affected by atrazine, while sucrose repressed its expression under s and sa conditions.

dehydroascorbate reductase  is a key component of the ascorbate recycling system. dhar recycles dehydroascorbate into ascorbate by using reduced glutathione as a reductant. two functional dhar genes, among three that are encoded in the arabidopsis thaliana genome, plus a putative gene, were represented in the microarray . the cytosolic dhar <dig>  and putative dhar  genes exhibited high induction in the combined presence of sucrose and atrazine, and, respectively, a slight repression or no variation in the presence of atrazine in comparison to control condition. in contrast to the repressive effects of atrazine, which were associated with a decrease of dhar activity, the increase of dhar transcript levels in the combined presence of sucrose and atrazine was not associated with an increase of global dhar enzyme activity .

reduction of monodehydroascorbate by monodehydroascorbate reductase  is also an important step in ascorbate recycling. among the five mdar genes present in the microarray, only cytosolic mdar <dig>  exhibited differential expression patterns according to the treatment applied. while atrazine repressed its expression, the protective combination of sucrose and atrazine upregulated it . atrazine was also found to decrease global mdar activity, while sucrose plus atrazine treatment resulted in maintenance of mdar activity relatively to the mannitol control .

glutathione serves as a reductant in oxidation-reduction processes, such as recycling of oxidised ascorbate by dehydroascorbate reductase  <cit> . reduction of oxidised glutathione is catalysed by glutathione reductase , which requires nadph. among the two isoenzymes present in the microarray, only the cytosolic glutathione reductase gr <dig>  was found to be induced by sucrose-atrazine and sucrose treatments, while no variation of expression was detected in the presence of atrazine . these variations of expression were not associated with changes of global gr activity, since no significant difference of activity was observed between treatments .

the second way to reduce h2o <dig> content in cells is activation of catalases , which catalyse dismutation of h2o <dig> into water and oxygen  <cit> . little variation of transcript levels was detected for the three catalase isoenzymes . cat <dig>  exhibited upregulation by atrazine stress, while cat <dig> was slightly downregulated by the protective sucrose plus atrazine treatment. in relation with these slight changes of transcript levels , global catalase activities were found to show little variation .

relative expressions of gene are given with their log <dig> for sucrose versus mannitol , mannitol plus atrazine versus mannitol  and sucrose plus atrazine versus mannitol  comparison. nde: not differentially expressed. genes with a bonferroni p-value higher than 5% were considered as being not differentially expressed as described by lurin et al.  <cit> .

discussion
characterisation of the impact of atrazine on ros patterns
ros patterns appear to depend strongly on the nature and intensity of stress conditions applied to plants  <cit> . it is therefore of great importance to characterise ros accumulation kinetics associated with a particular stress, and not to rely on expected effects. thus, while, as expected, atrazine inhibition of photosystem ii was associated with 1o <dig> accumulation  <cit>  , decrease of superoxide radical levels and increase of h2o <dig> levels were also observed . this disagreed with the proposed, but experimentally unproven, accumulation of superoxide radical by triazine treatment in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . it was however coherent with inhibition of photosynthetic activity and of the mehler reaction, whereby superoxide radical is formed by reduction of oxygen at the psi site  <cit> . atrazine binding to d <dig> protein of psii and inhibition of electron feeding to psi were indeed likely to decrease superoxide radical production by blocking the mehler reaction.

the induction of h2o <dig> accumulation by atrazine was all the more surprising as it occurred rapidly after transfer to atrazine  and in the absence or in the presence of sucrose, which by itself had a negative effect on h2o <dig> accumulation. this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of rapid in vivo h2o <dig> accumulation under conditions of atrazine treatment. the negative effect of sucrose on h2o <dig> accumulation was consistent with the previously-described repression of protein and lipid catabolism, including a number of oxidase-based processes, by soluble sugars  <cit> . in contrast, atrazine by itself was found to induce a number of genes encoding oxidases, the most highly induced being a gene encoding a proline oxidase . since this induction occurred prior to significant impairment of photosystems and phototrophic growth  <cit> , it could not be ascribed to a situation of metabolic starvation. activation of protein and lipid catabolism and of oxidase-based processes has been reported to occur under conditions of carbohydrate limitation or starvation  <cit> . in this context, it was extremely interesting that, in the presence of exogenous sucrose, i.e. in a situation of carbohydrate optimum, atrazine was able to induce a number of oxidase-encoding genes and other genes typical of carbohydrate-limitation response, such as the gene encoding isovaleryl-coa dehydrogenase  <cit> .

numerous abiotic stressors, including xenobiotics, are known to produce oxidative stress in photosynthetic organisms. this is the case for benzoxazolinone  <cit> , metronidazole, dinoterb  <cit> , acetochlor  <cit> , copper  <cit> , wounding  <cit>  and high light  <cit> . studies on these stresses mainly focus on the effects of a single ros and rarely consider the effects of ros combination. however, ros are chemically distinct and selectively perceived for the fine control of adjusting antioxidants and photosynthesis to different environmental stress conditions  <cit> . indeed, cross-talk between 1o <dig> and h2o <dig> has been clearly demonstrated by laloi et al.  <cit> , who suggested antagonistic interactions between 1o <dig> and h2o <dig> with a reduction of 1o2-mediated cell death and stress signalling response by h2o <dig> content. in contrast, the present condition of atrazine treatment, which eventually leads to plantlet death, was characterised by high 1o <dig>  high h2o <dig> and low superoxide radical levels. laloi et al.  <cit> , who described antagonistic effects between 1o <dig>  and h2o <dig>  modulated h2o <dig> levels in arabidopsis transgenic plants at the plastid level. it was thus possible that non-antagonistic effects of h2o <dig> and 1o <dig> under conditions of atrazine treatment were due to differences of ros localisation.

finally, among the set of  <dig> induced transcription factors that have been characterized as 1o2-specific by gadjev et al.  <cit> , only one was slightly induced  during the course of atrazine treatment despite the high accumulation of singlet oxygen . the analysis of 1o <dig> responses by gadjev et al.  <cit>  was based on studies of the arabidopsis conditional flu mutant  <cit> . it was thus clear that other signals than 1o <dig> were perceived by atrazine-treated plantlets or that atrazine-induced 1o <dig> accumulation involved other processes and responses than flu-mutant-dependent 1o <dig> accumulation  <cit> . however, full characterisation of the signalling events associated with xenobiotic exposure in plants remains to be carried out.

impairment of antioxidant defences in the presence of atrazine
atrazine-treated plantlets were characterised by low o <dig> - levels and high h2o <dig> levels, in contrast with sucrose-treated atrazine-tolerant plants, which showed high o <dig> - and high h2o <dig> levels. these differences of ros patterns were associated with striking differences of gene expressions and enzyme activities involved in ros-scavenging pathways.

thus, atrazine sensitivity was associated with down-regulation of key players of h2o <dig> scavenging. among the four enzymes involved in ascorbate-glutathione cycles, which are essential to remove large amounts of h2o <dig> generated by stress  <cit> , three enzymes  exhibited a significant decrease of global activities in atrazine-treated plantlets. moreover, this repression was correlated with a global down-regulation of typical corresponding transcripts , which, conversely, have already been shown to undergo important induction during responses to several environmental abiotic stresses. apx <dig>  a cytosolic enzyme, has previously been described as a central component of the reactive oxygen gene network of arabidopsis  <cit> . involvement of sapx in response to oxidative stress has also been reported by transcriptional induction in the presence of h2o <dig>  methylviologen, fecl <dig> or uv treatments in soybean seedlings  <cit> . finally, yoshida et al.  <cit>  reported the importance of dhar <dig> under conditions of ozone treatment, with higher sensitivity to ozone in a dhar2-deficient mutant, probably due to insufficient recycling of ascorbate.

consequently, repression of these transcripts and decrease of the corresponding enzyme activities in the presence of atrazine might accentuate the effects of h2o <dig> accumulation by reduction of ascorbate recycling, thus leading to disruption of antioxidant mechanisms and propagation of atrazine injuries. it was thus clear that the effects of atrazine at transcript level  <cit>  had actual negative consequences on biochemical defences and could be involved in xenobiotic sensitivity. this is strong evidence that xenobiotic sensitivity may be linked to gene regulation effects in plants. correlatively, the situation of sucrose-induced tolerance was characterised by the lifting of atrazine repression, in the case of apx <dig> and sapx, or by the induction by sucrose-atrazine combination, in the case of dhar <dig> and mdar <dig>  these positive effects on transcript levels were associated with maintenance of the corresponding enzyme activities at control levels. although ros can mediate induction of protective proteins involved in the stability of specific mrnas  <cit> , they can also cause rna oxidative damages and induce protein inactivation and degradation  <cit> . increase of transcript levels was therefore likely to be an adaptive response to ensure protein synthesis under stress conditions resulting in higher protein turnover.

the decline of o <dig> - levels in atrazine-treated plantlets, which, as explained above, could be ascribed to inhibition of electron transfer through psi, was associated with a general repression of transcripts encoding the different isoenzymes of sod and with a decrease of the global activity of this o <dig> --scavenging enzyme family, thus indicating that atrazine-treated cells responded to the low superoxide radical situation. association of low o <dig> - and high h2o <dig> may be a cause for the ill-adapted response of anti-oxidant defences in atrazine-treated plantlets, thus suggesting that further work should be carried out on the adaptation of organisms to fluctuations of ros combinations.

mechanisms of sucrose-induced tolerance to singlet oxygen
in contrast with non-induction of h2o2-scavenging systems, atrazine-treated plantlets seemed to be able to sense the increase of 1o <dig> levels and induce some genes potentially involved in 1o <dig> quenching . thus, atrazine-treated plantlets, in the absence or presence of sucrose showed increased expression of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase  gene , which could be involved in the maintenance of the photoprotective role of carotenoids. the at5g <dig> gene, encoding a chloroplastic thioredoxin, which is a potential 1o2-quencher  <cit> , was also induced in atrazine-treated plantlet. however, generally, the thioredoxin gene family was negatively affected by atrazine treatment, with  <dig> genes among  <dig> significantly repressed by atrazine. correlatively, ten of these twelve genes showed lifting of repression or significant induction in the combined presence of sucrose and atrazine. nevertheless, most of these genes encoded extraplastidial thioredoxins or thioredoxins of unknown localisation . the link of thioredoxin gene family differential expression with efficient 1o <dig> quenching in the presence of atrazine plus sucrose  was thus difficult to ascertain. on one hand, several studies have shown the efficiency of thioredoxins in maintenance of cellular reductant environment and in cytoprotective mechanisms  <cit> . on the other hand, efficient 1o <dig> quenching in the case of psii inhibition by atrazine would require the involvement of chloroplastic trxs. two trx genes, at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  have been described as encoding chloroplastic trxs . expression of these two genes showed contrasted patterns in the presence of atrazine or in the presence of sucrose plus atrazine, with at3g <dig> being repressed by atrazine, and at5g <dig> being induced by atrazine, whereas the presence of sucrose and atrazine resulted in a return to baseline levels. thus, further work would be required to analyse the physiological significance of this different pattern, and whether the at3g <dig> gene product may play an important role in atrazine responses. further work would also be required to characterise the potential importance of at1g <dig> and at2g <dig> trx genes, which are induced by sucrose and by sucrose plus atrazine, in sucrose-induced tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
parallel and integrative analysis therefore revealed correlated modifications of ros patterns, antioxidant biochemical defences, and corresponding transcript markers, under conditions of atrazine sensitivity and of sucrose-induced tolerance. atrazine injury was shown to be related with increased levels of singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide in leaves. sucrose-treated plantlets were able to sense changing ros levels and activate efficient quenching and antioxidant systems, whereas, in the absence of sucrose protection, atrazine-treated plantlets failed to develop fully these defence mechanisms. it thus seemed that atrazine may generate signals that activate some h2o2-producing pathways, and that impair the induction and activation of antioxidant defence mechanisms. further work is needed to characterise completely the complex signalling events associated with xenobiotic exposure in plants.
