BACKGROUND
encephalitozoon cuniculi is a member of the phylum microsporidia which are obligate intracellular parasites related to fungi  <cit>  and which infect most animal taxa and some protists. the environmentally resistant spores of e. cuniculi can infect a wide range of mammalian hosts, and is recognized as an opportunistic human pathogen in immunocompromised patients  <cit> . e. cuniculi is often described as a model organism for highly compacted genomes  <cit> . the high degree of host dependence leads an extreme reduction in the number of genes encoded in its genome  <cit> .

the ~  <dig>  mbp nuclear genome of e. cuniculi consists of  <dig> chromosomes ranging in size between  <dig> and  <dig> kbp  <cit> . restriction mapping indicated that the ends of each chromosome share a common domain of ~ <dig> kbp marked by the presence of one 16s-23s rdna transcription unit  <cit> . three e. cuniculi strains  have so far been identified on the basis of their immunological profile as well as by molecular analyses based on the presence of a variable number of gttt repeats within the unique rdna internal transcribed spacer separating the two rrna-coding regions  <cit> . comparative analyses of isolates differing in host and/or geographic origin revealed inter- and intra-strain karyotype variability  <cit> . chromosomal length polymorphisms  were found to be in the form of insertion-deletion events  over 3– <dig> kbp in size, occurring within transition zones between rdna units and chromosome cores  <cit> .

the genome sequence of the e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> strain i which was reported in  <dig>  <cit>  was obtained using whole genome sequencing . this effort revealed an unusually small genome containing about  <dig> candidate protein-coding genes that are densely packed and very rarely interrupted by introns of short sequences. although single-copy genes are predominant in this genome, the two ends of the smallest chromosome  share a common segment of ~  <dig> kbp that encompasses the subtelomeric rdna unit and covers a cluster of six genes  <cit> . genome mapping have indicated that the chromosomes of e. cuniculi contains one rdna gene at each extremity  <cit> . however due to an incomplete assembly of the genome of this parasite, only three rdna units have so far been assembled. chromosome ends assembly is inherently difficult and the process can be laborious even for reference genomes such as those of yeast, human or malaria parasites . in many cases, sequencing of chromosome ends is performed independently using a combination of molecular and bioinformatics methods . full assembly of chromosome ends in yeast and humans using this approach revealed a mosaic of specific interchromosomal segmental duplications  <cit> . in human pathogens, repeated sequences in these regions encode factors involved in host-cell interaction and/or immune escape mechanisms .

here we describe the final assembly of chromosome ends of e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> isolate. these ends represent about 15 % of the haploid size of the genome. the sub-terminal region of each chromosome is composed of large repeat units encoding components of four multigene families. these genes are organized in a novel mosaic structure of segmental duplications  ranging in size between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kbp. we have mapped specific recombination sites at the boundary of the subtelomeric and coding-core regions of the chromosomes and propose that double strand break repair mechanisms are responsible for their mosaic organization. these genetic rearrangments may have play a major role in parasite diversity, virulence and host-pathogen interactions.

RESULTS
mosaic organisation of chromosome ends
the two ends of each chromosome  of e. cuniculi were designated as Σα and Σβ, referring to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the watson strand of the sequence deposited in the database, respectively. sequence comparison between the different chromosome ends was first performed with miropeat software to identify gap free repeats  and confirmed by blast as previously described  <cit> . our analysis revealed that the available sequence of the subtelomeric regions is incomplete for the following three reasons:  the rdna-containing repeat is only found on both ends of chromosome i and on ivα extremity whereas previously reported physical mapping data indicated that each subtelomere includes the rdna unit  <cit> ;  no genes belonging to gene families known to associate with chromosome ends were detected on iiiβ and ixα, and  short duplicated sequences at far extremities are due to artificial truncations of subtelomeric specific repeats .

to determine chromosome ends organization in e. cuniculi in gb-m <dig> isolate, long pcr reactions were performed to amplify the chromosome extremities between the rdna region and the sequences available in the genbank database . overall, we obtained about  <dig> kbp of new sequence data, which are accessible under accession numbers hg <dig>  hg <dig>  hg <dig> and hg <dig>  the genome of e. cuniculi is diploid and the gb-m <dig> genome contains two chromosome iii homologues differing by a single indel  <cit> . we isolated and sequenced the two different chromosome iiiβ extremities from pcr products . sequencing effort further revealed uncharacterized sequences at chromosome iiα and ixα extremities. the new dna sequence characterized on chromosome iiα was also found to be present at chromosome ivβ extremity. the other extremities showed sequences in agreement with the data published so far. we deduce the sequence organisation between the end of available contigs and the rdna region on the basis of pcr and sequencing. this first step was essential to establishing the existence of large blocks of adjacent repetition units clustered at the ends of e. cuniculi chromosomes. using this approach, we defined  <dig> ext repeats that are completely or partially repeated among the  <dig> chromosome ends . they encode several cds, including house-keeping genes . altogether, these data indicate that ext repeats are components of the subtelomere in e. cuniculi.fig.  <dig> mosaic organization of subtelomeric sequences in the genome of encephalitozoon cuniculi gb-m <dig> . numbering from i to xi refers to the haploid set of chromosomes. the α end of each chromosome is represented on the left and β end on the right. as the diploid genome of e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> displays two homologous chromosomes iii having diverged at the β end, a total of  <dig> subtelomeres are described. colour gradation was used to represent the different ext sub-sequences issuing from the same ext repeat. the scale has been conserved to represent the different ext sub-sequences



e. cuniculi subtelomeric region includes the rdna unit and surrounding dna with a maximum length of  <dig> kbp on chromosome i. this so-called sub region is present and identical at all extremities . it has no similarity with either the ext repeats defined above or with the core sequences in the e. cuniculi genome even at cds level. this region lacks the stretches of repetitive sequences characteristic of the telomeric ends. based on pfge data  <cit> , the missing data between the sub region and the telomere could be estimated to about  <dig> to  <dig> kpb. the sub region contains a small taaa microsatellite, upstream of the rdna unit, at position  <dig> on iα. a small indel between chromosome i and chromosome iv  is the only polymorphism found between the sub copies in the e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> genome. the length of the sub region is variable near the ext repeats . the first breakpoint at  <dig>  kbp from the beginning of the rdna unit was labelled r <dig>  and was present on iiiα, vα and xβ ends . it marks the transition between the sub region and the ext <dig> repeat. the second breakpoint  at  <dig>  kbp from the beginning of the rdna unit indicates the transition between sub and either ext <dig>  or ext <dig> . the region between r <dig> and r <dig> sites, called sub- <dig>  is found on half of chromosome ends .fig.  <dig> distribution of ext sub-blocks illustrating extensive variations of chromosome ends organisation. a. the assignation to two main types of ext organization was performed on the basis of an anchoring with either recombination site r <dig>  or r <dig>  to the conserved sub region. breaks within ext blocks are indicated by vertical red bars. fusion events are marked by circles. the discontinuous lines connect the two recombination sites involved in the fusion. the inverted copy of ext6- <dig> is shown by an arrow.the inverted triangle indicates that ext <dig> contains divergent sub- <dig> and ext1- <dig> sequence presenting large deletions. colour gradation was used to represent the different ext sub-sequences issuing from a same ext repeat. the scale has been conserved to represent the different ext sub-sequences. b. distribution of the recombination sites  delimiting ext sub-blocks. these sites are often hot spots of sequence rearrangement and were identified by their telomere-associated distal sequence which was conserved after genetic events. the two iiiβ variants originate from a homologous recombination event that involving two r <dig> sites, that was conservative of the proximal block . the distal sequence of these sites is highly conserved over about 1000 bp  between ext2- <dig>  and ext3- <dig> 



chromosome ends assembly
all e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> chromosomes contain a  <dig> kbp large inverted repeat at each extremity . in some cases, the ext organization increases the size of the inverted repeat at chromosome extremities. the chromosomes with large symmetrical organisation are chromosome i , vi  and viii . consequently, the e. cuniculi chromosomes are the largest amphimeric molecules described so far . each ext repeat is generally present once per extremity. we identified sub-sequences because some ext copies were truncated. breakpoints within ext are scattered among the  <dig> extremities . no physical link was established between the ext <dig> repeat and the sub region in the first release of the e. cuniculi genome. sequencing of long-pcr products specific of extremities iiα and ivβ revealed that the sub-to-ext <dig> junction occurs via a sub/ext <dig> sequence organization .

ext <dig> and ext <dig> are unique in the genome sequence of e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> strain, but are of ext origin. ext <dig> was characterized on the basis of blast homologies shared with other exts, particulary with regard to cdss ecu06_ <dig> and ecu06_ <dig>  sequence of ixα extremity shows the presence of a degenerated copy of ext <dig>  the sequence is marked by a large deletion in the ext1- <dig> region . we therefore postulate that the ixα extremity represent an early step in the evolution of a new ext .

characterization of the two iiiβ extremities  was particularly difficult to achieve . this organisation was determined based on long-read assembly from subclones obtained from a long-pcr product and it was confirmed using data from the genome project. the iiiβ <dig> consensus shows a genomic organization that is close to the viβ extremity with repeats order sub/ext3-1/ext4-1/ext2- <dig>  the ext-to-core transition is made by a new ext block  encompassing the newecu <dig> gene characterized at transcriptional level by dia et al.  <cit> . pcr amplifications, sequencing and reassembly of reads from the genome project have shown that the ext <dig> and ext-to-core transition are conserved among the two iiiβ chromosome copies . the iiiβ <dig> organization is highly homologous to iiiα providing a new example of large amphimeric molecule . high sequence similarities between ext2- <dig> and ext3- <dig> may explain the difficulties in discriminating between the two iiiβ extremities in the previous genome assembly. the size difference between the two iiiβ genomic organisations reach  <dig>  kbp which is consistent with the pfge-estimated size polymorphism  <cit> . the present study revealed that the size polymorphism between chromosome iii homologues results from an unequal exchange of chromosome ends. this exchange likely resulted from a homologous recombination in the highly conserved sequence between ext2- <dig> and ext3- <dig> fig.  <dig> sequence features justifying chromosome length polymorphism  for two chromosome iii homologues in e. cuniculi gb-m <dig>  cdss are represented by boxes with arrows indicating transcription direction and are ordered from telomere  to chromosome core . grey colour is applied to the members of three multigenic families: interb, interc or interd. name and/or uniprot accession number are given for cdss characterized by the genome project. the telomere-associated distal parts of the two extremities are identical up to r <dig> recombination site. the region of homology between the two extremities starts again just upstream of ext <dig>  in between, the ext4-1-ext2- <dig> organisation is  <dig>  kbp longer than ext3- <dig>  vertical bars show recombination sites. their width covers the region where they are expected to be located. r <dig> is the only site that is precisely mapped in this region. the iiiβ <dig> and iiiβ <dig> ext <dig> copies are differing by the number of copies of a catca microsatellite extending 3’ of newecu <dig> at ~ 50 bp of r <dig>  very few mismatches are observed between ext2- <dig> and ext3- <dig> over ~ 1000 bp at the left-hand part of r <dig>  the iiiβ <dig> sequence is strictly identical to viβ end up to r <dig> but significant homologies persist downstream of r <dig> up to the middle of the newecu <dig> gene. both ext2- <dig> and ext3- <dig> display a g indel in a polyg repeat restoring a complete interc cds 



recombination sites border ext repeats
the irregular distribution of subtelomeric repeats among the different chromosomes of e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> indicates a significant reshuffling of chromosome ends . a striking feature of this organisation is the gradient of diversity in ext composition from the rdna unit to the coding core of the chromosomes . a total of  <dig> recombination sites  were mapped and identified on the basis of their distal sequence . some of them are involved in more than one transition event in the e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> genome and might be considered as hotspots of sequence rearrangement . r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> were the only sites that could be precisely mapped. in this study, the other recombination sites could only be approximately mapped . the r <dig> recombination site is located in the subtelomere and is associated to the sub-ext <dig> transition. fifteen recombination sites are associated with the ext-to-core transitions. r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> are associated with two ext-to-core transitions. the recombination sites r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> result from ext truncations. the r <dig> site is present twice in the genome and at a different distance from the r <dig> site because of the presence of two iiiβ ext sequence organisations .

nine recombination sites  are associated with internal ext rearrangements responsible for various arrangements of ext repeats at the different chromosome extremities . r <dig> recombination site is at ext3-ext <dig> transition; the r <dig> site is associated with the ext5-ext <dig> transition; the r <dig> recombination hot spot is responsible for a rare translocation event at viβ and iiiβ <dig> extremities. consequently, the r <dig> site is located in two different ext regions  that share strong homologies in their proximal extremities . this site is in the area of the transition with ext <dig> both at iiiβ <dig> and iiiβ <dig> extremities. r <dig> site is also at the ext4-ext <dig> transition. the r <dig> site corresponds to the ext4-ext <dig> transition. the r <dig> recombination site is associated with the ext6- <dig> inverted copy at ext6-ext <dig> transition. in this case r <dig> recombined with r <dig>  according to fig.  <dig>  inversion of ext repeats is a rare event in the genome of the e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> isolate.

ext repeats-associated multigene families
an important finding in this study is that ext repeats differ in gene content, some of them encoding housekeeping genes. an aminopeptidase-dihydrofolate reductase -thymidylate synthase  gene cluster is indeed specific to ext1- <dig> . three other adjacent genes encoding serine hydroxymethyltransferase, an abc transporter and a protein of the nap/set family are located in the ext1- <dig> sub-sequence. the ext1- <dig> repeat is restricted to chromosome i. the sub-sequence ext7- <dig> contains the ribosomal protein rl12-encoding gene. we estimate that ~  <dig> cds are associated with chromosome ends in the current assembly of the e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> genome.

sequence comparison of ext repeats revealed that they are composed of a common set of repeats called a, b, c, d and e . all of these sequences overlap with predicted cdss. the presence of four multigene families was confirmed by gene-to-gene comparison at the genomic scale. they were named interae, interb, interc and interd. repeats a and e refer to the same gene family. ext <dig> and ext <dig> encode the c- and n-terminal regions of a same putative proteins, respectively . more divergent copies of interae genes exist, the a repeat being the only conserved part of the gene . some interae genes are pseudogenes because of the presence of a frameshift between the a and e repeats  or due to the absence of the e corresponding sequence . multigene families interb, interc and interd also contain pseudogenes. overall, we found  <dig> interae,  <dig> interb,  <dig> interc and  <dig> interd related cds in the e. cuniculi genome .fig.  <dig> miropeat comparison of eight e. cuniculi ext blocks . the detected repeats correspond to cdss classified into four distinct inter gene families . ext <dig> sequence was extracted from iα end, ext <dig> from iiα, ext <dig> from xβ, ext <dig> from xiα, ext <dig> from viiα, ext <dig> from xα, ext <dig> from viiiβ and ext <dig> from viα . ext <dig> was extracted from entry hg <dig>  and ext <dig> from entry hg <dig> . ext <dig> and ext <dig> were too divergent from other ext blocks to be presented on the diagram, at the used threshold value. the a and e repeats are located inside the same cds that is therefore designated as interae. the e repeat is more variable than a. some similarity exists between interae and interb proteins . only two ext blocks  harbour c-type sequences but other copies of these sequences are found in the core regions of chromosomes ix, x and xi. one divergent interc copy has been identified in ext <dig>  as many recombination sites are mapped within interd genes, d repeat have been separated into two parts d <dig> and d2



the pfam database identified four protein domains of unknown function among the proteins encoded by these genes: 1) duf <dig> domain was identified because of the high level of sequence similarities that exist at the amino acid level between the c-terminus part of interae  and interb proteins; 2) duf <dig> domain corresponds to the n-terminal part of the proteins encoded by full interae and interb genes; 3) duf <dig> is found in interc genes encoded polypeptides; and 4) duf <dig> is found in interd proteins. more divergent sequences were found in the uncharacterized protein family entries of uniprot knowledgebase: upf <dig> , upf <dig> . these domains were also found, albeit less frequently, in telomere-associated orfs in other encephalitozoon species  <cit> . the interb gene family is also present in more distant microsporidian species vittaforma cornea and anncaliia  algerae  <cit> .

while interae, interb and interd families are restricted to subtelomeres, twelve additional interc genes were found on three chromosome cores. eight genes are found on chromosome ix and two on chromosomes x and xi. the orientation of all interae and interb genes is the same and the genes are transcribed in the same orientation as the rdna unit, i.e. towards the telomere. the interc and interd genes are transcribed in the opposite direction, i.e. in a centripetal way. experimental evidence for transcription capacity has been previously shown for interb genes  <cit> . most of the recombination sites are associated with these multigene families. a large part of the polymorphism in interae gene family is due to the presence of the r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> recombination sites within the e inter-region . rearrangement events between interb genes are less common. some of these genes are disrupted by the r <dig> site  and two recombination sites are associated with interb 5-prime sequences . the duplicated r <dig> recombination site and r <dig> site are adjacent to the 3-prime region of interc genes .

six breakpoints  are found within interd genes ; with r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> as hot spots of recombination. genes from the interd multigene family are the most overhauled compared to the three other gene families. the interd consensus gene could be divided into two segments, d <dig> and d <dig>  encoding the respective n-terminal and c-terminal protein regions . the d <dig> part of the genes extends over the promoter region. most interd genes encode a full protein of about  <dig> residues. some recombination events results in the linkage of an interd segment  to a non-specific orf . this tight relationship between multigene families and recombination sites support the model that all ext repeats have a common origin and that chromosome end organisation results mostly from homologous recombination events.

nucleotide composition of chromosome ends
the extremities of e. cuniculi chromosomes contain a high gc content  compared to the central parts of the molecules . the gc content is calculated using a sliding window whose order of magnitude is usually around 500 bp. this approach is useful to study long-distance tendency but is characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio and low resolution . as described by other authors  <cit> , all the e. cuniculi chromosome cores share a bell-shaped gc % curve with a nearly central apex reaching 54–59 % . the sequences at the transition with ext blocks exhibit the lowest values . the transition rate value between the minimum gc % value associated with a chromosome end and the maximum value observed in the nearby ext region could increase sharply or slowly as shown on additional file 1: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> the ext-to-core transition is associated to a shift of gc % average values. a the gc % is calculated over one horizon  along the sequence of chromosome ii. all chromosome extremities are characterised by a high gc content in e. cuniculi. the transition with the central part of the chromosome is improved by the bell-like shape of the gc % curve over the coding core region. the gc % values are high at the centre of the molecules. the gc content of the chromosome core sequence diminishes progressively from the centre to the end by accumulation of local minima. the chromosome ii is represented in a opposite orientation. b ext <dig> repeat in a gc rich region at iiβ extremity . all ext repeats  are associated with high gc % values. after touching its minimal value, the gc-curve is growing more or less rapidly depending on extremities when ext sequences are read in a core to telomere orientation. the iiβ extremity is part of extremities presenting a slow growing curve at the ext-to-core transition. c ext-to-core transitions are associated to low gc %. the gc % minimum value was plotted in function of the ext-to-core transition for each extremity. coordinates were calculated from the corresponding end of the consensus sequence



two alternatives approaches have been used to evaluate in more details the base composition at chromosome ends. we first used the genefizz software implementing a helix-coil transition model to search for local variations in dna melting properties . the state of the dna molecule was measured at different temperatures along the whole chromosome with a sliding window of 20 bp  <cit> . curves calculated at different temperatures were superimposed to identify regions where the transition between closed and open states requires an increase of the temperature by several degrees . the gc rich regions of the genome such as chromosome ends are in closed state at  <dig> or 75 °c. it was possible to identify rapid transition between open and closed states in those regions when temperature is increased because of the high resolution of the genefizz local analysis of the dna melting properties. recombination sites found in ext repeats are associated with open-close transitions of more than 3 °c . the average distance between the recombination site and the temperature shift is approx. 700 bp.fig.  <dig> recombination sites are located close to dna melting resistant regions. a the state of the dna molecule between “closed”  and “open”  was measured at different temperature along the viiiβ extremity. the genefizz software was implementing an algorithm which was able to calculate melting state of the dna molecule locally  <cit> . this algorithm had no mathematical horizon . curves calculated at different temperature were superimposed to identify regions where the transition between closed and open state requires a temperature increase of several degrees . doubled arrows at the top of schema indicate the distance between the recombination site and transition zone. recombination sites have been mapped in centromere proximal part of a closed region. we never found recombination sites within a closed region, but the distance to a closed region vary from a hundred of base pair to one kbp. the hatched area associated to r <dig> recombination site covers the region where it is expected to be located. r <dig> and r <dig> have been precisely mapped. b recombination sites are associated with dna melting resistant regions. the transition between closed and open state of the dna molecule was plotted in function of the position of the recombination site for all sites at all extremities. coordinates were calculated from the corresponding end of the consensus sequence



the second approach consisted of the characterization of at and gc skews along dna strands in a 2d representation. this method is known as “dna walk”  <cit> . it is a graphical method where the trails obtained for e. cuniculi chromosomes support the existence of a strong difference in the base composition between the core and the chromosome ends. each chromosome core appears as a highly compact area with a wealth of loops . the compactness of the curve is higher than in a random sequence measuring brownian motion . by contrast, the ext and sub regions display near-monotonic functions . the progression in the sequence from the core to the extremity shows a g + a enrichment for most of the ext blocks and a g + t enrichment for sub blocks including the rdna region . the ext-to-core frontier does not agree with the transition from a compact to a near-monotonic function . this transition occurs between dhfr and ts genes within ext <dig>  in the case of iα, iβ and viiiα extremities. in the case of iiα chromosome end, transition takes place within the coding core at ~  <dig> kbp from ext region. local analysis of ext repeats revealed that the dna walk properties are tightly associated with interae, interb and interd cds .fig.  <dig> genomic landscape of encephalitozoon cuniculi. gc and at base composition skews were evaluated simultaneously using a 2d representation where the curve is drawn while reading the sequence from the 5-prime to 3-prime end. the course of the curve is obtained by going up for a g and down for a c and left or right whether an a or a t was read respectively. the evolution of gc and at skews is similar for the  <dig> chromosomes of e. cuniculi. in a 2d representation, the core of the molecule presents a globular structure whereas the ext and sub sequences are characterized by g enrichment . the at skew is in an opposite way between ext repeats and sub region. the distal end of the sub region is composed of repeats which present a t accumulation only. the compactness of the coding core regions of e. cuniculi chromosomes is apparently higher than thus observed in a random sequence . horizontal and vertical discontinuous lines indicate the zero position on the ordinate and abscise respectively. the two lines get cross at the first base in 5-prime of the consensus sequence deposited in the database

fig.  <dig> gc and at base composition skews in ext repeats and sub regions are associated to transcription and replication. a
e. cuniculi chromosome iα extremity containing ext <dig> repeat. terminal regions  present accumulation of g. the inversion of the at skew takes place at r <dig> recombination site. this observation suggests that the region between r <dig> and r <dig> sites is related to the sub region despite the presence of an interd gene close to r <dig>  the accumulation of a is strongly associated with the presence of interae and interb genes. the curve is in fact doing the revers in the gene poor region upstream of ecu01_ <dig> interae gene. the g enrichment starts after the dhfr-ts gene cluster in ext1- <dig> repeat. these knee points on the curve do not match with recombination sites. b
e. cuniculi chromosome iiα extremity containing ext <dig> repeat. r <dig> and r <dig> recombination site are not present in the consensus sequence of chromosome ii actually present. the accumulation of a in ext <dig> repeat is strongly associated with the presence of interae and interb genes. it is also associated to interd genes in ext2- <dig> but not in ext2- <dig> sub-sequence. the interc gene in ext2- <dig> displays a frame shift. it is therefore encoded by two putative cds which may be two parts of a pseudogene. as all interc members, these cdss are not associated to any base composition biases. the coding core region outside ext <dig> also exhibits an accumulation of a up to cds ecu02_ <dig>  the inflexion of the curve between ecu02_ <dig> and ecu02_ <dig> cds is marked by the inversion of both gc and at skew. the same phenomenon is observed between ecu02_ <dig> and ecu02_ <dig> cds. in both case genes are all transcribed in the same orientation. this suggests that origins of replication are present at these points in the iiα extremity. c
e. cuniculi chromosome xiα extremity containing ext <dig> repeat. an a + g accumulation is detected all over the ext <dig> repeat starting at r <dig> recombination site. however, the curve shows several inflexion points due to local inversion of at skew. the two interb genes present in this repeat are associated with these knee points. cds names have been reduced to the last four digit numbers for a matter of space



discussion
first inventory of telomere-associated gene families in a microsporidian species
the interae, interb, interc and interd gene families of e. cuniculi gb-m <dig>  currently offer the most complete view of subtelomeric gene repertoires in a microsporidian species. the interae and interb full genes such as ecu04_ <dig> encode a protein precursor with an er-signal peptide and a mature polypeptide containing a single n-terminal transmembrane domain and two conserved intracellular domains . the interc genes encode polypeptides with  <dig> to  <dig> predicted c-terminal transmembrane domains associated with the duf <dig> domain . no recognizable signal peptides were found in these proteins suggesting that the first transmembrane domain could be involved in endoplasmic reticulum targeting. position of positively charged amino acids and tmpred predictions suggest that the n-terminal end of the interc proteins is located in the cytosol. most interd proteins have  <dig> transmembrane domains. the physiological function of these genes remains unknown.

as shown in a study specifically devoted to interb gene family, some gene copies can be actively transcribed  <cit> . genetic rearrangement among this gene family is less frequent than in the interae or interd families. indeed, interb multigene family contains only two truncated copies , one pseudogene in ext <dig> and only one recombination site . we also demonstrated that interb genes are conserved in four microsporidian species known to infect humans  algerae), but not in species that parasitize insects or fish  <cit> . the finding of such genes in a. algerae is notable because  this species is a parasite of mosquitoes and accidentally infect humans  <cit> , and  its genome is more complex  than the one of encephalitozoon species  <cit> . hence, the interb repository would be of relatively ancient origin and might play a key role in the adaptation to the invasion of mammalian hosts.

the present work revealed the predominance of genes assigned to the interd family. the interd coding sequences are all oriented in the opposite direction of interb genes in ext repeats. many recombination sites have been mapped within interd genes and several cds represent pseudogenes. orf fusion is also observed in the interd multigene family. interestingly, the promoter region of the consensus copy  is predicted to contain a ccaat box upstream of the tata box, a rare case among all other e. cuniculi genes. thus, a transcriptional control involving specific interactions of the ccaat box with a heteromeric complex similar to the yeast hap2/hap <dig> complex  <cit>  may be considered for interd gene regulation. the two candidate cdss for this complex are ecu03_ <dig>  and ecu10_ <dig> . ecu03_ <dig> encodes a truncated hap <dig> homologue .

the interc and interd gene repository can be found in other encephalitozoon species sequenced so far according to microsporidiadb. noteworthy some members of the interc gene family are present in the chromosome coding core region . this is also the case of some multigene families coding for variable surface antigens in protozoan parasites, e.g. var family in plasmodium falciparum  <cit> , vesa genes in babesia bovis  <cit>  or vsg family in trypanosoma brucei  <cit> . the interc family is only represented by  <dig> genes at chromosome extremities. we notice that four of them are presenting a frame shift mutation. as many interc genes are present in the coding core of chromosome ix , x  and xi , it is conceivable that the existence of chromosome core-associated loci reflects an early phase of the expansion of a subtelomeric gene family. this view is underpinned by the specific organization of interc genes at internal loci which are present by pair in inverted orientation. the transfer of genes towards proximal subtelomeric domains might have taken place afterwards as suggested by the presence of the ecu07_ <dig> gene at ext-to-core transition of viiβ extremity. then, the duplication of ext regions responsible for the amplification of interae, interb and interd multigene family would also have enhanced interc gene copy number at chromosome extremities. however, we cannot fully exclude the alternate hypothesis involving a subtelomere-to-core gene transfer, as a prerequisite to the preservation of an essential function.

the sequencing of several encephalitozoon genomes revealed the high level of conservation of gene content and structure of chromosome coding core region . microsporidiadb database confirmed the presence of the four gene families in e. intestinalis, e. hellem and e. romaleae genome. other telomere-associated gene families were also described in these species  <cit> . the ext region remains much less extended in the genome of e. intestinalis  <cit> . protein features  strongly suggest the products of these gene families could interact between each other. for a better understanding of the adaptation of microsporidia to their host organisms, it will be especially important to determine whether expression of some of these genes is required for immune evasion and/or host cell invasion.

chromosome regionalisation in e. cuniculi genome
the chromosomes of e. cuniculi gb-m <dig> show three regions that share little to no homologies between each other: the coding core, the ext repeats and the sub region. ext repeats and sub region persist on all chromosome ends of the small genome of e. cuniculi, which contrasts with the low redundancy of chromosome core-associated genes and the lack of large repetitive elements related to transposons. the whole length of dna allocated to chromosome ends reaches about  <dig> kbp, representing ~ 15 % of the haploid genome size. the sub region is  <dig> kbp large encompassing one rdna unit and ending with the telomere. the size of the chromosome regions comprising the ext repeats varies from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp. the gene density is high in ext repeats. genetic information appears highly compartmentalized in e. cuniculi genome.

base composition at chromosome ends is significantly different from the coding core region. chromosome extremities are characterized by a high gc content . this gc enrichment is associated with a gc skew that extends from the ext-to-core transition to the end of the rdna region . base composition of the ext and sub sequences does not depend on gene content. it might result from strand asymmetries in the frequency of mutations which could be related to either replication and/or transcription. replication and transcription are intrinsically asymmetric processes that could lead to biased mutation rates between leading and lagging strands or template and non-template strand respectively. in prokaryotes, where transcription and replication often occur in the same direction, the leading replicating strand presents an excess of g over c and of t over a . in eukaryotes, the existence of similar replication-associated asymmetries has been established both in the human genome and in the yeast centromeric and telomeric regions . in fact, the lagging strand is temporarily single-stranded during the replication process and is more likely to undergo deamination of methylated cytosine which will be mutated into thymine  <cit> . the same strand asymmetry has been observed in the polycistronic region of the genomes of kinetoplastidae  <cit>  but transcription can be associated with a different transition rate asymmetry in genomes where transcriptional units are organized in a more standard way  <cit> . processes such as default in the repair machinery are then invoked to explain differences between replication- and transcription-associated base transition rates  <cit> . other dna associated mechanisms do influence base composition as well. meiotic recombination which is a symmetrical process influences gc content at hot spots of recombination in eukaryotic genomes . the process driving w  - > s  transition in regions surrounding meiotic recombination sites is called gc-biased gene conversion .

the strand-asymmetry found in the sub sequence, between the ext repeats and rdna region, is characterized by an excess of g and t on the strand read in that orientation . according to transition rate models described above, this asymmetrical skew pattern is indicative of constitutively active replication origin for many generations. it suggests that no origin of replication is present within the sub region or in the telomeric region. the last origin of replication should be located in either an ext repeat or the coding core part of the chromosome. we observed an inversion of the at skew between ext and sub regions. the excess of a could result from the activity of the rna polymerase. the g + a over c + t enrichment is strongly associated with cds except for the interc genes that behave as the coding-core regions . chromosome iiα extremity strengthens this view because the at and gc skews extend far away beginning of the ext2- <dig> repeat in the coding region where all genes are transcribed in the same orientation and skews are inverted as genes are transcribed in the opposite way . the origin of replication responsible for the duplication of the iiα extremity during s phase might then be located between cds ecu02_ <dig> and ecu02_ <dig> 

strand-asymmetry in e. cuniculi chromosome ends is in agreement with the model that replication and/or transcription are acting all over the region in a centripetal way. replication may then continue up to the telomere past the rdna unit. the absence of gc skew in the part of the molecule might be related to its origin. although available only for chromosome i ends, the terminal sequence extending downstream of rdna is characterized by heterogeneous degenerated tracts of telomeric dna  <cit> . strand-asymmetry dna walk profiles strengthen the idea of a regionalisation of the end of e. cuniculi chromosomes and helps to differentiate the subtelomere  from a subterminal region corresponding to the ext repeats.

chromosome regionalisation reflects cellular organization
telomere bouquets are common structure in eukaryotes. in yeast and plasmodium, these structures where the telomere is attached to the nuclear membrane exist all along the cell cycle . nuclear periphery has emerged as an essential aspect of gene regulation during interphase  <cit> . this compartment is enriched for silencing factors such as sir <dig>  a nad-dependent lysine deacetylase involved in the formation of heterochromatin . in the absence of insulator, the effect of telomere-associated protein complexes  can extend over several kbp  <cit> . repression of genes in sub-terminal regions is called the telomere position effect: tpe  <cit> . many components of the telosome are present in e. cuniculi . this mechanism may influence the expression of ext genes which are very likely polii genes. indeed, dia et al. have shown that the interb genes are not transcribed with the same efficiency in e. cuniculi  <cit> . furthermore, the sub region in e. cuniculi could be considered as heterochromatin for several reasons: 1) it contains the rdna region, a usual component of constitutive heterochromatin ; 2) it codes for very few genes and 3) significant methylation of the cytosine in the heterochromatin region would increase the possibility of c- > t transitions.

the telomeres are associated with dna repair and recombination factors which are recruited by members of the telosome . these factors are essential to double strand breaks  repair processes at chromosome extremities. these dsb are deleterious as they are associated with the loss of the telomere and correct anchoring of the chromosome extremity to nuclear periphery. repair mechanisms of double-strand break  involve homologous recombination  or non-homologous end joining   <cit> . e. cuniculi lacks nearly all nhej pathway associated proteins  <cit> . the break induced replication pathway  is a dbsr that depends on homologous recombination at micro-homology domains and enables telomere capture . in yeast, telomere capture would lead to recombinant chromosomes that share similar structure and favour the formation of amphimeric molecules  <cit> . mosaic organisation and gradient diversity of ext regions could be explained by dsbr such as bir. cluster of telomere at nuclear periphery would help this phenomenon. interestingly, this mechanism could also be at the origin of many clp observed in e. cuniculi isolates  <cit> .

the regionalisation of e. cuniculi chromosomes is the result of multiple interactions at chromosome extremity . the telomere recruits the telosome, a protein complex that is rich in proteins involved in dsbr. mosaic organisation of chromosome ends suggests that ext repeats are more susceptible to dsb. we consider the resistance to tensile and bending of the dna molecule to model and assess the presence of the sub-terminal region in e. cuniculi . on one side of the ext regions, transcription and replication acting continuously in the coding core of the chromosome are generating a continuous agitation of the dna molecule. on the other side, the subtelomeric region  is attached through the telomere to the nuclear periphery and protected from tensile and bending by the compactness of constitutive heterochromatin organisation. ductile overload fracture will occur as forces are applied to ext repeats causing permanent distortion and subsequent fracture . this model might be universal suggesting that telomeric, subtelomeric and sub-terminal regions could in fact be distinguished among eukaryotic chromosomes. further analysis will be essential to evaluate their relative presence in other genomes. genetic importance of chromosome extremities emphasizes the fact that great effort will be necessary in the future to characterize more carefully these regions during whole genome sequencing efforts.fig.  <dig> regionalisation of the dna molecules depends on several biological processes. four regions could be found in e. cuniculi genome . we summarize all the possible mechanism that may influence genetic structure and base composition of e. cuniculi chromosome extremities . the sub region corresponds to the subtelomere and is related to heterochromatin state. the ext repeats are presenting a mosaic organisation in e. cuniculi genome. they contain genes that might experience telomere position effect . we suggest that continuous tensile and bending forces applied on the ext by the movement of the coding region are responsible for double strand breaks . the predicted “ductility” of the dna need to be further tested. this model can be applied to other eukaryotic genomes with specific properties of each organism. gene content and protein complexes such as telosome, dna or rna replication might deeply influence the presence of sub-terminal region in other genomes



CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the e. cuniculi chromosome extremities revealed novel properties of sutelomeric regions: a mosaic organisation of the sequence, a gc content bias, presence of putative coding sequences  that were organized in multigene families that seemed specific to human microsporidia and recombination sites as borders of blocks of repeats. the organization of the chromosome ends in e. cuniculi has been compared with those of reference genomes such as that of yeast, human or malaria parasites. in many cases, sequencing of chromosome ends revealed a mosaic of specific interchromosomal segmental duplications as observed in e. cuniculi. the potential importance of the multigene families described is also discuss as in many human parasites where repeated sequences in these regions encode factors involved in host-cell interaction and/or immune escape mechanisms.

the findings reported here on this important model genome for a human parasite may change our understanding of chromosome ends in eukaryotes, their biology, evolution and relationship to pathogenesis.
