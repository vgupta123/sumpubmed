BACKGROUND
rumen epithelium  consists of leaflike papillae, which not only serves as absorptive structures, but also epithelial barrier to prevent the invasion of rumen microbes and/or toxins  <cit> . the morphology of the rumen epithelium plays a critical role in coping with altered dietary regimens in ruminants  <cit> . during the dietary transition period, the morphology of re could be changed by diets with different energy density, which may be attributed to the varied volatile fatty acids  concentrations  <cit> . in addition, physical features of diet such as the finely ground compared with unground feed were also known to alter the re morphology in dairy cows  <cit> .

recent studies have found that butyrate acts as a mitogenic factor and signaling molecule during cell proliferation in both cattle and humans . the increase in the total thickness of the re in goats after ruminal butyrate infusion has been reported, and the expression of cyclin d <dig> gene was found to be associated with the increased papillae growth at the same time  <cit> . in addition, the changes in epithelial thickness can be linked to various cellular functions, such as cell proliferation  <cit>  and epithelial differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . at the transcriptional level  <cit> , it has been identified that re morphology was related to gene targeting functions such as cellular development  <cit> , epithelial proliferation  <cit> , papilla size and surface area  <cit> , and tight junctions  <cit> . these studies revealed aspects of the potential mechanisms by which re morphology is regulated, but the systematic mechanisms involved in regulating rumen epithelial morphology remain to be clarified.

rna sequencing , a high-throughput sequencing based transcriptome profiling, has been proven to provide extensive quantitative and qualitative information on the expression of genes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit>  and their potential changes under different conditions. this technique has been successfully applied to identify potential transcriptional mechanisms underlying phenotypic and physiological changes in bovine species  <cit> , leading to the findings of “potential gene markers”  <cit> . therefore, in the current study rna-seq based transcriptomic profiling was used to investigate the effects of dietary forage sources with different nutritional values  and physical forms  on the re morphology and the underlying mechanism in dairy cows.

discussion
rna-seq is an effective, efficient, and widely used method for conducting analyses in transcriptional status and functional gene discovery  <cit> . the transcripts detected from rumen epithelial tissue in this study with dairy cows were relatively lower compared with the previous study detected from rumen epithelial tissue of beef cattle  <cit>  . however, the majority of the transcripts was identified in both studies, with  <dig>  common transcripts. in this study, feeding lactating dairy cows with three diets with different forage sources, which varied in feed particle sizes and energy densities, led to changes in rumen papillary morphology and vfas concentrations in the rumen. by linking dietary composition, rumen fermentation traits, rumen epithelial morphology, and rumen epithelial transcriptomes together, the effects of dietary physical and nutritional factors on rumen epithelial morphology and the underlying mechanisms were identified.

nutritional factors
in the current study, we found that the function of ah associated de gene dsg <dig>  was enriched under the ion-binding function as well as was associated with tight junctions. this gene encodes a member of the desmoglein protein subfamily which has been reported to be involved in epithelial cell proliferation in bovine epidermis and tongue papillae  <cit> . it has been speculated that ion binding in the rumen may be attributed to the na+-k--atpase transport system for nutrient absorption  <cit> . na+-k- pumps are predominately localized to the innermost living cell layers of the stratum spinosum and the stratum germinativum  <cit> . increased vfas absorption by greater na+-k--atpase activity could prevent possible disturbance of epithelial functions   <cit> . the higher amount of vfas and the greater expression of dsg <dig> in cows fed ah diet indicates likely more nutrient transport through re when animals fed ah diet.

in the meantime, the absorption of the nutrients through the re consists of active transport and passive transport pathways  <cit> . the transmural movement of vfas is a concentration-dependent passive diffusion process, which contributes to the absorption of vfa in addition to the carrier-mediated vfas transport  <cit> . the rate of uptake of vfas through passive pathway can be as high as up to 75% in the re  <cit> , and the wp of re could be directly associated with the passive nutrient uptake. therefore, the increased wp in rs fed animals indicate the potentially lower absorption of vfa which may lead to lower productivity and feed efficiency  <cit>  when compared to ah and cs-fed animals. moreover, the function of arg <dig>  has been reported to be involved in catalyzing the hydrolysis of arginine to ornithine and urea in bovine liver  <cit> . it has been reported that n conversion efficiency in cs or rs-fed cows were lower than that in ah-fed cows  <cit> . the observed expression differences in genes involved in aa metabolism in re may further provide the explanation of re function in n metabolism under different forage-based diets.

in this study, de gene c <dig>  was enriched in the function of complement activation, alternative pathway, playing an integral role in the assembly of complement complex  <cit> , and c <dig>  an activator of the classical complement pathway  <cit> , was enriched in the function of extracellular region. activation of the complement system forms a major part of the innate immune system, resulting in the formation of complement complex  <cit> . complement c2/c <dig> was involved in the complement component that is a key system for immune surveillance and homeostasis  <cit> . serum amyloid a protein  is an inflammatory factor and plasma saa is considered as the important acute phase proteins in cattle  <cit> . furthermore, the expression of c <dig>  c <dig>  and saa <dig> was correlated with the concentration of butyrate , total vfa and acetate , and total vfa, acetate, and propionate , respectively, regardless of dietary effects. to date, the expression of these genes was not reported from re, and the findings of its relationship with butyrate and other vfas under ah or rs may provide the evidence on its function in the rumen health.

in addition, the expression of lpo and krt <dig> was negatively correlated with butyrate and total vfa concentration regardless of dietary effects or in cs. lactoperoxidase  is an important component of defense mechanism in the body with the antimicrobial and physical properties  <cit> . keratins , the epithelial-specific intermediate filaments, changes in keratin gene expression implied the effect on terminal keratin synthesis, which might affect the epithelium morphology  <cit> . the previous study found that butyrate infusion could down-regulate the expression of lpo and krt <dig> in re  <cit> . moreover, the expression of pi <dig> was lower in cows fed ah compared with cs and rs and enriched in the function of extracellular region. the pi <dig> gene, which is also known as the elastase-specific inhibitor, is a low-molecular-weight proteinase inhibitor that is synthesized and secreted at the site of neutrophil infiltration  <cit> . the covalent cross-linking of the pi <dig> protein to ecm proteins  <cit> , confers the antimicrobial activity on pi <dig> and promotes its involvement in the innate immune system, and protects epithelial surfaces from being infected  <cit> . therefore, the down-regulation of pi <dig> together with increased vfas in ah may suggest the protective function against for adverse or irritant factors’ absorption but promoting vfas’ assimilate from re, which then improving the animal performance for ah-fed animals. therefore, the identified de genes and their relationships with vfas in response to different forage diets reveal that the observed changes in re morphology could result from dietary induced vfa changes, especially butyrate, and their effect on gene expression. future studies are needed to understand the roles of vfas on the expression of c <dig>  c <dig>  saa <dig>  lpo, krt <dig>  pi <dig> and rumen epithelium barrier, nutrient absorption, as well as the pathway of complement and coagulation cascades in re using in vitro and in vivo models.

in ruminants, the stimulation of papilla growth by vfas or concentrates stimulating rumen epithelial functions has also been well described  <cit> , for example, butyrate is a specific inhibitor of ruminal apoptosis as well as a stimulator of papillae proliferation  <cit> . additionally, the cellular or tissue proliferation/apoptotic processes in re could directly affect rumen papillae morphology. in this study, we reported the expression of bag <dig> was down-regulated in cows fed ah and was positively correlated with ruminal wp . the bag <dig> has been reported to play an important role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion  <cit> , suggesting that the lower expression of this gene could be associated with the lower proliferation/apoptotic processes in re which could subsequently lead to thinner epithelial layer in cows fed ah. in addition, it has been reported that bag <dig> and hspb <dig>  member 8) were chaperone complex targeting misfolded proteins to macroautophagy  <cit> , which is a process that can be activated in response to the nutrient deficiency in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . hspb <dig> is known to recognize the misfolded proteins whereas bag <dig> might recruit and activate the macroautophagy machinery  <cit> . thus, the expression differences in hspb <dig> and bag <dig> in cows fed cs and rs suggest that the cells of re might suffer macroautophagy due to the lower energy supply and nutrient availability  from these two cereal straw diets.

from the above results, it is suggested that energy density may regulate the immunologic barrier and nutritional transport in ruminal epithelium by influencing ion binding, complement activation, and cell growth, partly induced by altered ruminal vfas concentration.

physical factors
recent studies have proposed that in addition to nutrients , fiber particle characteristics  and the effective fiber content may also play a key role in rumen muscularization and volume development  <cit> . in the current study, the observed significant greater rumen papillae width when animals fed with rs, which contains higher pendf comparing to in cs and ah, further highlights the importance of dietary physical factor in affecting the ruminal morphology.

particle size can regulate rumen development by altering blood supply to the re  <cit> . when cows ingested large quantities of solid rice straw, the re was exposed to indigestible solid fiber, and the rumen cyclically contracted to mix the solid fiber  <cit> . accordingly, the cows fed a diet with a larger particle size  may secrete more saliva, since the salivary secretion could be enhanced by an increased intake of physically effective fiber  <cit> . it has been proposed that rumen development regulation can be mediated through decorin  and the egf receptors and that a direct interaction exists between these two receptor to regulate cell growth during remodeling  <cit> . the egf, a bioactive peptide  <cit> , stimulates epithelial proliferation and differentiation when supplied to the luminal side of the rumen via the saliva  <cit> . intrinsic egf-like molecules in the digestive tract are known to maintain mucosal integrity by controlling epithelial cell turnover and accelerating the healing of mucosal injuries  <cit> . indeed, the expression of gene encoding multiple egf like domains  <dig>  was positively correlated with the rumen papillae width  although it was not differentially expressed among the diets. gene expression is not always correlated with the protein expression, therefore, future study is needed to measure the protein level of dcn and megf <dig>  in order to provide more information on how these two genes are involved in rumen epithelial cell proliferation. in addition, the expression of dcn  was significantly higher in rs compared to cs-fed animals, which might be attributed to the increase in salivary secretion due to stimulation by a larger dietary particle size  <cit> . future studies are needed to measure the salivary secretion difference in ah, rs, and cs-fed cows to verify their role in affecting wp.

in the current study, the expression of igfbp <dig> was lower in cows fed rs compared with those fed ah. the igfbp <dig> has been well characterized to have functions opposing igf- <dig> events  <cit> . igf- <dig> is reported to be involved in rumen epithelial growth, as it induces re cell proliferation in vitro  <cit> . the cellular events associated with igf- <dig> are modulated by the function of igfbp  <cit> , which may either inhibit or stimulate cellular proliferation or differentiation due to the effects of igfs  <cit> . in addition, the down-regulated expression of the igfbp <dig> genes in re of cows was mainly due to the accelerated cellular migration and postmitotic aging induced by subacute ruminal acidosis, which can influence ruminal epithelial growth  <cit> . the changes in mrna abundance of igfbp <dig> in rs cows might be attributed to reduced organization and intercellular adhesion between the cells of the stratum granulosum. this suggests that the physical factor affects the structural integrity of the re, through influencing the expression of several related genes such as igfbp <dig>  in the meantime, the expression of cyr <dig> and nov were also down-regulated in rs fed cows compared to that in ah fed cows. their encoded proteins are members of the cnn family, which share similarities with igfbp. cyr <dig> is a secreted, extracellular matrix -associated heparin-binding protein, mediating cell adhesion, stimulates cell migration, and potentiates growth factor-induced dna synthesis in fibroblasts and endothelial cells  <cit> . therefore, the down-regulation of igfbp <dig> and cyr <dig>  as well as up-regulation of pi <dig> might enhance cellular growth in the re under the rs diet, which could be one of the causes of the increase in epithelial width.

the expression of hla-dqa <dig> was higher in cows fed rs, compared to cs, and was significantly positively correlated with the ruminal wp. it has been reported that the down-regulation of this gene can reduce antigen-specific human t cell proliferation  <cit> , which might indicate the potential function of hla-dqa <dig> in cell proliferation and explain the observed relationship with rumen epithelial width under rs diet. the expression of ugt2b <dig> was down-regulated in cows fed rs diet compared with that fed cs diet. down-regulation of ugt2b <dig> by growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor family may increase the proliferation of androgen-dependent tumors  <cit> . therefore, its significant negative correlation with the wp might indicate its potential function in the proliferation of rumen epithelium. although both hla-dqa <dig> and ugt2b <dig> showed potential relationship with wp under different diets, the functions of these genes in the rumen epithelia have not been reported. future studies are needed to verify their changes in expression and their function in cell proliferation in re, and how they could be related to rumen wp in other studies or potentially in vitro cell models. regardless, this is the first study to report the physical factor derived expression change of these genes in the rumen epithelia and their relationship with rumen epithelial morphology. future studies are needed to verify their function and the action of mode in impacting the ruminal epithelial morphology.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our obtained de genes by transcriptome analysis suggest that diet can affect the expression of genes involved in ion binding, cellular growth, and cell proliferation, which may lead to the alteration of re morphology. a possible mechanism that affects the rumen epithelium function and morphology through physical and nutritional factor under different forages based diets was proposed . the interaction of dietary nutritional and physical factors could affect the rumen microbiota and microbial fermentation that could subsequently alter the expression of the de genes including igfbp <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  saa <dig>  bag <dig>  hspb <dig>  pi <dig>  lpo, arg <dig>  dsg <dig>  hla-dqa <dig>  and ugt2b <dig>  which have the function associated with the tissue morphology or nutritional absorption. the de genes hla-dqa <dig> and ugt2b <dig> identified in this study may be also involved in cell proliferation in rumen epithelium, with further validation research needed. among the identified de genes, hla-dqa <dig>  igfbp <dig>  dsg <dig>  and bag <dig> may be potential gene markers for the re morphology and the indicators for nutrient metabolism in the rumen, c <dig> and pi <dig> may be potential gene markers for the nutrient transport such as vfas absorption through re. overall, our results suggest that the dietary physical form is important for the morphology of re in lactating dairy cows in addition to the dietary nutritional level, indicating that the forage particle size should be moderate when prepared for total mixed ration diet; and that shorter particle size of low-quality forage may be beneficial for vfas synthesis as well as absorption . future studies are needed to identify how the morphological changes in the re-induced by nutritional and physical factors as well as the interaction between them impact nutrient absorption by the rumen papillae, thereby increasing our understanding of how feeding strategies influence the function of the rumen. also, measuring the protein level of the identified de genes from this study is needed to verify the dietary effects on the relationship between the re morphology and altered gene expression. regardless, our results provide novel insights into the potential transcriptional mechanisms involved in regulating rumen epithelial width and may offer guidance for future experimentation related to balancing rumen epithelial characteristics and dietary regimens.fig.  <dig> a proposed relationship between transcriptional mechanism and phenotype of the morphology of re affected by nutritional and physical factors in the cows fed three different diets. the arrows with solid red line indicate the significant correlation between the two defined items from this study . arrows with solid blue line indicate the determined or reported relationship between the two defined items. while arrows with dotted blue line indicate the potential correlation between the two items identified from this study. ah = total mixed ration  containing alfalfa hay as the main forage; cs = tmr containing corn stover as the main forage; rs = tmr containing rice straw as the main forage. the different colors or shapes across the genes represent the differentially expressed genes among the comparisons between  <dig> dietary treatments. bag3 = bcl2-associated athanogene 3; c2 = complement c2; c7 = complement c7; dsg1 = desmoglein 1; hla-dqa1 = major histocompatibility complex, class ii, dq alpha 1; hspb8 = heat shock protein family b  member 8; igfbp3 = insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3; lpo = lactoperoxidase; pi3 = peptidase inhibitor  <dig>  skin-derived; saa1 = serum amyloid a1; ugt2b17 = udp glucuronosyltransferase family  <dig> member b <dig>  color version available in the online pdf
