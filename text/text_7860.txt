BACKGROUND
the ability to adapt to different environments is critical for all living organisms. mechanisms of adaptation range from rapid changes in gene transcription to stable genetic changes that occur over an evolutionary time frame. phase variation is a specific adaptive mechanism that typically involves a rapid switch between two different states  to enable individual microbial cells to vary expression of proteins. bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli, neisseria meningitides and helicobacter pylori are examples of organisms where phase variation, affecting the expression of flagella, fimbriae and outer membrane proteins, has been well documented  <cit> . phase variation has also been observed in a number of non-pathogenic bacteria including geobacillus stearothermophilus, acidithiobacillus ferroxidans, and bacillus subtilis  <cit> .

regulation of phase variation can occur through multiple, different mechanisms, including homologous and site-specific recombination events that generate chromosomal changes that activate or inactivate expression of a gene  <cit> , e.g., due to inversion of a promoter element. another effective mechanism for rapid phenotypic diversification among bacteria is through generation of genetic diversity in regions of short sequence repeats , and, in particular in homopolymeric tracts . frameshift mutations in hts can occur at high frequencies and enable efficient and reversible gene inactivation  <cit> . the high mutation rate in hts results from slipped-strand mispairing , which occurs during dna replication and causes insertions or deletions   <cit> . indels in hts located in coding genes usually create a shift in the gene's translational reading frame, resulting in expression of truncated and often non-functional proteins. in particular, mutations at the 5' end of a coding gene usually lead to expression of short, non-functional peptides. for example, the bacillus subtilis swra gene, which is involved in swarming, is phase variable due to a frameshift insertion in a poly ht between nt  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in campylobacter coli, a deletion in a poly ht at the 5'end of flha has been shown to be responsible for the phase variation of flha expression  <cit> . in the human foodborne pathogen listeria monocytogenes, frameshift deletions have been observed in a 5' poly ht in the virulence gene inla  <cit> . this gene encodes the internalin protein, a virulence factor necessary for internalization into human intestinal epithelial cells and hence required for effective systemic infection  <cit> . although the 5' frameshift mutation in inla seems to be more prevalent among food isolates, a few human isolates have also been found presenting this genotype  <cit> .

to broadly probe for the distribution of hts in prokaryotes and to gain further insights in possible regulatory roles of hts, the coding sequences of  <dig> prokaryotic  genomes were scanned for the presence of hts . our data indicate that prokaryotes have evolved to contain hts within the 5' ends of coding sequences, probably to contribute to regulation of gene expression  as frameshift mutations closer to the 5'end of coding genes would more effectively abolish expression of the full protein. further functional studies in l. monocytogenes showed that the poly ht located in the inla 5' end shows a high 6a to 7a reversion frequency, which is about  <dig>  fold higher than the estimated average frequency for point mutations. combined with other studies that also showed high mutation frequencies in other bacterial hts, our data indicate that hypermutable hts appear to represent a universal system for regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes.

RESULTS
poly and poly hts with up to  <dig> bases are generally overrepresented in prokaryotic coding genes
analyses of the coding genes of  <dig> prokaryotic  genomes showed that poly and poly hts ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bases in length were significantly  overrepresented in the coding genes of most prokaryotic genomes evaluated . for example, poly hts with  <dig> bases were overrepresented, in coding genes, of  <dig> of the  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> of the  <dig> archaeal genomes. as genomes with high gc content will have low expected frequencies of poly and poly hts with  <dig> or more bases, genomes with high gc content do not show underrepresentation of poly and poly hts . for example, the expected frequency of poly hts with  <dig> bases for a genome with gc content of 70% and approximately  <dig>  mb of coding sequence is close to  <dig> ; hence it would be statistically impossible to detect an underrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> bases in this genome. the converse is also true for genomes with low gc content, which will have low expected frequencies of poly and poly hts with  <dig> or more bases. while a total of  <dig> genomes showed no overrepresentation of poly or poly hts with  <dig> to  <dig> bases, there are no apparent common features among these genomes. briefly, these  <dig> genomes represent  <dig> bacterial genomes and  <dig> archaeal genomes. the genomes include human pathogens  as well as fungal symbionts  and non-pathogenic free living organisms . in terms of genome features, the gc content of these  <dig> organisms range from 33% to 74%, the total length of coding genes range from  <dig> , <dig> nt to  <dig> , <dig> nt and the number of coding genes in each genome ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> 

while poly and poly hts with more than  <dig> bases were generally underrepresented in the genomes evaluated, poly hts with  <dig> and/or  <dig> bases were overrepresented in  <dig> genomes  and poly hts with  <dig> and/or  <dig> bases were only overrepresented in  <dig> genomes . among the genomes that show overrepresentation of poly or poly hts with  <dig> or  <dig> bases, only thermus thermophilus has a gc content greater than 50% .

hts longer than  <dig> bases were generally not overrepresented among the coding genes evaluated, although some exceptions could be observed. for example, coding genes in  <dig> of  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> of  <dig> archaeal genomes also showed overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> bases. overall,  <dig> genomes showed significant overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> and/or  <dig> bases, including buchnera aphidicola, borrelia burgdorferi, and chlamydia trachomatis, three of seven organisms with less than  <dig> genes in their chromosome included among the genomes analyzed here. b. aphidicola and b. burgdorferi also showed overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases.

among the archaeal genomes, only the candidatus methanoregula genome showed significant overrepresentation of poly or poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases . wilcoxon tests on z-scores for overrepresentation of poly and poly hts showed that, compared to archaeal genomes, bacterial genomes showed increased overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> to  <dig> bases  and poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases . furthermore, prokaryotic genomes of mammalian pathogens showed significant overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases  as compared to other prokaryotes .

as it is tempting to hypothesize that hts may be associated with specific functional gene classes , we also performed a preliminary analysis on the frequency of hts among genes representing different role categories  in two model organisms, i.e., l. monocytogenes strain egd-e and b. aphidicola strain cc, which presented overrepresentation of long poly and poly hts with highest deviations from the expected values among the organisms studied. these analyses did not show any clear pattern that would indicate that some specific role categories would be associated with overrepresentation of long hts . for example, only l. monocytogenes genes classified as "hypothetical proteins" or "regulatory functions" showed an overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> bases, while all role categories but "signal transduction" and "protein synthesis" showed overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> bases. no role categories showed overrepresentation of hts with  <dig> or more bases in l. monocytogenes. conversely, in b. aphidicola, all role categories showed overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases and only "regulatory functions" did not show overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> bases.

poly and poly hts are located significantly closer to the 5'end of coding genes, suggesting a role for poly and poly hts in regulation of gene expression through phase variation and reversible gene inactivation
we hypothesized that if hts evolved to contribute to regulation of gene expression , selective pressures would favor the placement of the hts near the 5' end of the reading frame, where frameshift mutations would more effectively abolish expression of the full protein. therefore, the relative position of hts  within a given coding gene was also investigated among the  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal genomes analyzed. as the number of bases in poly and poly hts increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  the hts were located closer to the 5' end of coding genes . however, hts >  <dig> bases as well as poly and poly hts were not located significantly closer to the 5'ends of coding genes. to further assess whether the relative locations of poly and poly hts with  <dig> to  <dig> bases were significantly biased towards the 5'end of coding genes, we compared the observed number of a ht in the first 10% of coding genes  against the expected number of the same ht  under the assumption that hts are uniformly distributed within a given gene. the observed numbers of hts in the first 10% of coding genes was significantly greater for all hts as compared to the expected number of hts . moreover, the odds ratio of having an ht in the first 10% bases of coding genes in the observed dataset as compared to the expected dataset generally increases as the number of bases in the ht increases .

overall, poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases were located significantly closer to the 5'end of the genes in the genomes of mammalian prokaryotic pathogens as compared to other prokaryotes  . poly hts, on the other hand, were not located closer to the 5' end in the genes of mammalian prokaryotic pathogens as compared to other prokaryotes . wilcoxon one-sided tests also revealed that, compared to archaeal genomes, poly hts with  <dig> to  <dig> bases from bacterial genomes are located significantly closer to the 5'end of coding genes . conversely, compared to bacterial genomes, poly hts with  <dig> bases from archaeal genomes are located significantly closer to the 5' end of genes .

while aaa and ttt codons are preferentially located at the 5' end of genes, the same is not observed for aag and ttc codons, which encode the same amino acids as aaa and ttt
to test whether the positioning of poly and poly hts was associated with the placement, at the n-terminal end of proteins, of amino acids encoded by the aaa or ttt codons, we analyzed the distribution of these two codons as well as the distribution of the aag and ttc codons, as these pairs of codons encode the same two amino acids, i.e., lysine  and phenylalanine . analyses of the coding sequences from all  <dig> genomes tested here found that both aaa and ttt codons are located significantly closer to the 5' end of the coding genes as compared to the aag and ttc codons, respectively . these results suggest that the location of poly and poly hts closer to the 5'end of coding genes is not a consequence of a preferential location of the lys and phe amino acids at the n-terminal of prokaryotic proteins.

when compared to a randomly generated uniformly distributed dataset of pseudo relative locations, lys was located significantly closer to the c-terminal ends of proteins  than it would be expected if the relative locations of lys were uniformly distributed. the c-terminal enrichment of lys can not be explained by the distribution of poly hts as 39% of the lys at the c-terminal are encoded by the aag codon and poly hts are located significantly closer to the 5'end of genes. we thus investigated the location of all other  <dig> amino acids in all coding genes of the  <dig> prokaryotic genomes and observed that, in additions to lys, arginine  was also located in the c-terminal of proteins. this c-terminal placement of arg was also statistically significant . as lys and arg are similar amino acids  these data suggest that the c-terminal enrichment for lys is associated with the biochemical characteristics of the amino acid itself.

position of poly and poly hts at 5' ends of genes is not associated with aaa and ttt codon usage
one possible explanation for a bias towards aaa and ttt codons at the 5' end of genes could be selection for common  codons at 5' end of genes to improve translational efficiency and avoid ribosome stalling. we thus assessed whether the position of poly and poly hts was associated with codon usage patterns for aaa and ttt codons. among the  <dig> prokaryotic genomes analyzed, aaa and ttt were preferred codons  for  <dig> and  <dig> genomes, respectively. on the other hand, for  <dig> and  <dig> genomes, aag and ttc codons represented the preferred codons; in these genomes aag and ttc represented > 70% of the lys and phe codons, respectively. even among these genomes with high preference for codons aag and ttc, significant clustering of aaa and ttt codons in the 5'end of genes was observed . overall, these data suggest no association between the positioning bias of hts and codon bias and thus indicate that the position of poly and poly hts within prokaryotic coding genes is not driven by codon bias.

a 5' poly ht in l. monocytogenes inla facilitates high frequency adenosine insertion that restores inla translational frame
to further investigate the role of hts in phase variation and gene inactivation, we used the facultative intracellular pathogen l. monocytogenes as a model. l. monocytogenes shows significant positioning of poly hts with up to  <dig> bases closer to the 5'end of genes; a <dig> hts occur with a frequency of approx.  <dig>  hts per coding gene . a <dig> and t <dig> tracts are also located significantly closer to the 5'end of genes  in the l. monocytogenes genome.

we specifically used a l. monocytogenes poly ht in the 5' end of inla as a model to investigate the mutation frequency of poly hts. the 5' inla poly ht was previously shown to be polymorphic in l. monocytogenes. in one phylogenetic l. monocytogenes lineage  the 5' end of inla either includes an a <dig> ht, which leads to an in-frame inla, or an a <dig> ht, which causes a frameshift mutation with a premature stop codon after aa  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, all l. monocytogenes isolates in lineage i characterized so far as well as some lineage ii isolates carry a "aagaaaa"  sequence  instead of an a <dig> or a <dig> ht  <cit> . translational out of frame fusions between the three different allelic variants at the 5'end of inla and kanr, a kanamycin resistance gene, were created in l. monocytogenes fsl f2- <dig>  to investigate the frequency of frameshift mutations including the frequency of  a <dig> → a <dig> and  a <dig> → a <dig>  and  the frequency of deletions in a2ga4; in each case, the mutation of interest would revert an out-of frame kanr fusion to an in-frame kanr fusion that yields a kanamycin resistance phenotype. in three biological replicates, the strain carrying an a <dig> out of frame kanr fusion showed between  <dig>  and  <dig>  revertants per  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> bacteria, indicating an a <dig> → a <dig> reversion frequency of approx.  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . on the other hand, only a single revertant was obtained in one of the three replicate experiments with the strain carrying an a <dig> out of frame kanr fusion, indicating a low a <dig> → a <dig> reversion frequency . in three biological replicates, no kanamycin resistant revertants with a deletion in the a2ga <dig> region were observed, indicating a very low frequency of deletions .

the frameshift mutation in a poly ht in the 5' end of l. monocytogenes inla has at least two independent origins
to further investigate the origin of the frameshift mutation in l. monocytogenes inla, the dna sequences including the noncoding region upstream inla as well as the 5' coding region of the gene from  <dig> l. monocytogenes isolates  were used to probe the phylogenetic history of this fragment in these isolates. the frameshift mutation seems to have arisen at least twice, independently, among l. monocytogenes lineage ii isolates . interestingly, one of the clusters containing inla sequences with the a <dig> allele  also contained isolates with the a <dig> allele. in this clade, the only difference between the inla sequences with a <dig> ht and the inla sequences with the a <dig> ht was the single adenine indel in this ht.

phylogenetic analyses of inla sequences also showed that all inla sequences for l. monocytogenes lineage i isolates  have an a2ga <dig> instead of an a <dig>  sequence. among the  <dig> lineage ii isolates only  <dig> carried this a2ga4; the other lineage ii isolates carried either an a <dig>  or an a <dig>  sequence at this location. the  <dig> lineage ii inla sequences with an a2ga <dig> sequence at the 5' end formed five cluster, including three clusters that were located within the clade that contained all lineage i inla sequences, suggesting that these lineage ii isolates acquired this allele from a lineage i ancestor through horizontal gene transfer followed by homologous recombination. the observation that the other inla sequences with an a2ga <dig> sequence at the 5' end of inla formed two distinct clusters within the clade that contained only lineage ii inla sequences, suggests that these two clusters with an a2ga <dig> sequence 5' end of inla arose at least twice independently, suggesting a strong selective pressure for this change.

discussion
genome wide analyses on  <dig> prokaryotic genomes  as well as in-depth characterization of evolutionary history and reversion frequency in a poly homopolymeric tract in l. monocytogenes inla were performed to evaluate the role of homopolymeric tracts as general regulatory features allowing for rapid gene silencing and phase switching. overall, our data indicate that  poly and poly homopolymeric tracts are overrepresented in prokaryotic genes and preferentially located at the 5' ends of genes, indicating selective pressure for presence of these homopolymeric tracts consistent with their role as regulatory elements, and  poly homopolymeric tracts show high mutation frequency in l. monocytogenes and are used to selectively inactivate the virulence gene inla.

poly and poly homopolymeric tracts are overrepresented in prokaryotic genes and preferentially located at the 5' ends of genes
our analysis of homopolymeric tracts in coding genes of  <dig> prokaryotic genomes showed that poly and poly hts with  <dig> to  <dig> bases are overrepresented in most of these genomes while poly and poly tracts are not. interestingly, mammalian pathogens showed increased overrepresentation of poly hts with  <dig> and  <dig> bases as compared to other prokaryotes . this may reflect the higher need for phase-variable antigens among mammalian pathogens in order to evade the host immune system  <cit> . for example, several h. pylori outer membrane proteins were shown to be phase variable during murine infection  <cit> . additional putative targets of the mammalian immune system were shown to be phase variable in other pathogens, including mycoplasma spp  <cit> , burkholderia mallei  <cit> , and bordetella pertussis  <cit> , among others. the only organism, among those analyzed, with overrepresentation of poly and poly tracts with  <dig> to  <dig> nt was the endosymbiont b. aphidicola. poly hts had previously been shown to be overrepresented in the b. aphidicola genome, which is extremely at rich  <cit> . while frameshift mutations were observed in several poly tracts in b. aphidicola, transcriptional polymerase slippage appears to generate heterogeneous mrnas for these genes, including a number of mrnas encoding in-frame proteins, suggesting that at least in some organisms frameshifts in homopolymeric tracts may not always fully inactivate gene function.

overall, our data also showed that longer poly and poly hts are located significantly closer to the 5' ends of genes as compared to shorter tracts in prokaryotic genomes. as there was no association between the location of these hts close to the 5' end of coding genes and either  codon bias or  placement of amino acids encoded by aaa and ttt codons , these data support the hypothesis that the location of hts at the 5' end of coding genes was driven by selection for dna sequences that provide an effective mechanism for high frequency mutations, which would permit phase variation or reversible gene inactivation. as the frequency of frameshift mutations tends to increase as the ht length increases  <cit> , longer hts located closer to the beginning of genes are likely to allow for more efficient phase variation and gene inactivation as compared to shorter hts.

our hypothesis that homopolymeric tracts located at the 5' ends of prokaryotic coding genes provide a general mechanism for effective phase variation or reversible gene inactivation in the majority of prokaryotes is also supported by a number of previous studies on specific organisms or specific genes. for example, in b. subtilis, frameshift mutations in a poly ht at the 5'end of swra occur at high frequency, roughly 10- <dig> and 10- <dig> for a base pair deletion  and insertion , respectively  <cit> . a c. coli poly ht at the 5'end of flha showed a deletion frequency of  <dig> × 10- <dig>  and an insertion frequency of  <dig> × 10- <dig>   <cit> . in mycoplasma hominis, a 5'poly ht in vaa- <dig> is associated with phase variation of the vaa antigen. the switching frequency between the vaa+  and vaa-  phenotypes was estimated as 10- <dig> to < 10- <dig>  <cit> . in our model, the l. monocytogenes inla 5' ht, we observed a frequency of insertion of an adenine in the a <dig> tract  in the order of 10- <dig>  while the frequency of an adenine deletion in this ht  was lower, suggesting that mutation events that lead to reversion to a full length inla are more common in this ht. further examples of hts involved in phase variation include a poly ht at the 5'end of the mycoplasma fermentans p <dig> gene, which encodes the abc transporter subunit p <dig>  <cit> . in this ht, deletion of one adenine in the 7-base tract was shown to result in inactivation of the gene. frameshift mutations in a 5' poly ht in flhb from pseudomonas putida have also been described  <cit> . interestingly, our data showed that h. pylori is the only species in our dataset with overrepresentation of poly, poly, poly, and poly hts with  <dig> to  <dig> bases. consistent with this observation, there are many examples of h. pylori genes that are phase variable due to indels in hts  <cit> . for example, tannaes et al.  reported a poly ht involved in phase variation of h. pylori plda, which encodes the phospholipase a. this gene has been shown to be phase variable during murine colonization of the gastric environment by h. pylori  <cit> ; gene inactivation occurs by insertion of a guanine in a  <dig> nt poly ht in plda.

poly homopolymeric tracts show high mutation frequency in l. monocytogenes and are used to selectively inactivate the virulence gene inla
as initial data have shown that a 5' poly ht in inla, which encodes the l. monocytogenes internalin a protein, shows frequent frameshift mutations that result in a truncated and inactive  <dig> aa peptide  <cit> , we used this gene as a model to further probe the contributions of hts to phase-shifting and reversible gene inactivation in bacterial pathogens. natural l. monocytogenes isolates have been shown to either carry an a <dig>  a <dig>  or a2ga <dig> sequence starting at inla nt 6; while an a <dig> or an a2ga <dig> sequence at this location maintain an in-frame inla orf, an a <dig> sequence at this location leads to the truncated  <dig> aa peptide. although l. monocytogenes represents at least four phylogenetic lineages   <cit> , a <dig> or a <dig> hts have so far only been identified in the inla gene of lineage ii isolates . all inla sequences for isolates representing other lineages  were found to harbor an a2ga <dig> sequence at the 5' location of inla, which our data indicate represents a stabilized ht that shows a lower mutation frequency as compared to the poly ht at this location. the frequency of an a <dig> → a <dig> reversion was estimated as approx.  <dig>  fold higher than the estimated average point mutation frequency . although the experimentally observed reversion frequency from a <dig> → a <dig> is not significantly different from the lack of any revertants observed for a2ga <dig>  our population genetics studies clearly show that the deletion a <dig> → a <dig> occurred at least twice, indicating that this mutation occurs in nature and is biologically relevant. interestingly, while l. monocytogenes lineage i strains are overrepresented among human disease associated isolates and lineage iii isolates are overrepresented among animal disease associated isolates  <cit> , lineage ii strains are overrepresented among foods and non-clinical disease associated isolates, even though they are regularly isolated from human and animal listeriosis cases  <cit> . hence it appears that disease associated l. monocytogenes have evolved an inla sequence that facilitates stable expression of this virulence gene, which is essential for infection  <cit> , while some generalist strains  have evolved mechanisms that allow for reversible silencing of inla, possibly during environmental survival or inside hosts where inla is not required . interestingly, some lineage ii strains have acquired, through multiple independent events, an a2ga <dig> sequence at the inla 5' end, possibly suggesting adaptation, of some clades and strains within lineage ii, to a more disease associated lifestyle . these data suggest that evolutionary forces select for presence of hts in specific prokaryotic genes and genetic lineages, possibly to facilitate adaptation to specific ecological niches and lifestyles . as our genome wide analyses suggest broad selection for presence of hts and their location in the 5' region of coding genes in prokaryotic genomes in general, hts thus appear to play important roles in facilitating adaptation and gene regulation in prokaryotes. future phenotypic and genetic studies will be needed though, to clarify the biological relevance of hts in l. monocytogenes and other prokaryotes. for example, even though l. monocytogenes showed a considerable number of genes with poly and poly hts, beyond our data reported here, no functional analyses of long hts in l. monocytogenes have been reported. in addition, none of the previous genome analyses in listeria have included a comprehensive analysis of frameshift mutations, even though one hts in l. monocytogenes flar has been found to show evidence for phase variation based on population data  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on our findings, we propose that hts, particularly those at the 5' end of coding genes, represent a universal prokaryotic system that allows for effective gene inactivation and phase switching. this system for gene regulation is considerably slower than rapid transcriptional and translational mechanism of gene regulation, but faster and more reversible than other chromosomal mutational events. as an emerging body of evidence also supports that hts also enable rapid diversification of both coding and regulatory genetic sequences in eukaryotes  <cit> , hts appear to represent a universal mechanism for mutational adaptation across diverse life forms.
