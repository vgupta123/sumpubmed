BACKGROUND
with the completion of its genome sequence populus trichocarpa, the genus populus  has become the consensus model taxon for woody plant genomics and biotechnology. many attributes of populus makes it well suited for genomic research, including facile transformation of selected genotypes; abundant natural genetic diversity; ease of vegetative propagation; rapid growth; interspecific hybrids and mapping pedigrees; availability of genome scale microarrays; and abundant est resources . although herbaceous short generation models such as arabidopsis have powerful advantages for studying plant development, including fundamental aspects of lignocellulosic tissue development  <cit> , poplar enables a detailed, integrated analysis of secondary growth and other developmental processes such as seasonal dormancy induction whose expression is not fully developed in annual herbaceous species.

the perennial stem growth habit of most tree species is characterized by secondary growth that results in a cumulative increase in girth during each growth cycle. this is achieved by cell division activity of the vascular cambium, with subsequent differentiation of secondary xylem towards the inside of the cambium and secondary phloem towards the outside. this coordinated and environmentally responsive program of meristematic differentiation and tissue patterning involves multiple developmental processes with interacting regulatory mechanisms .

with the increasing availability of genomic tools, many studies have been conducted to help understand these developmental processes in more depth. wood development has been characterized by expression profiling in aspen  <cit> , pinus  <cit> , black locust  <cit> , eucalyptus  <cit>  and spruce  <cit> . these studies, and investigations on vascular cell development in herbaceous species arabidopsis and zinnia, have identified several classes of important transcription regulators and structural genes involved in secondary cell wall biogenesis . the developmental transition from primary to secondary growth that occurs along the stem has been used as a unique system to identify processes specific to secondary growth in sitka spruce  <cit>  and aspen  <cit> . the aspen studies, based on cdna-aflp, characterized  <dig> and  <dig> transcript derived fragments, respectively, as differentially expressed during secondary growth, and includes many regulatory and structural genes involved in secondary growth and secondary wall biogenesis. our study extends this line of work to comprehensively cover the transcriptome of populus during primary to secondary growth transition. we detected more than  <dig>  populus trichocarpa genes, and found that more than  <dig>  were differentially expressed during stem development. we also provide an in depth look at the expression of several classes of transcription regulators and structural gene families whose functions are closely linked to stem and wood development.

RESULTS
poplar stem development
to determine transcriptional changes that occur during primary and secondary growth phases of stem development, we analyzed stem segments from successive internodes below the apex , and from internode   <dig> from further down the stem. in <dig> was not analyzed as it was too short to sample without including tissue from the nodes and axillary meristems.

the shoot apical meristem of poplar is an indeterminate primary meristem that gives rise to ground tissue and procambium. the vascular tissue of primary growth, primary xylem and primary phloem, develops directly from procambium and is the dominant vasculature in in <dig> and in <dig> . in <dig> shows the first signs of interfascicular parenchyma cells that differentiate into a full ring of cambium initials, enabling radial secondary stem growth. in <dig> and in  <dig> have well developed secondary phloem tissue and secondary xylem vessels, as well as fibers with well lignified secondary walls . figure  <dig> illustrates that the zone of stem elongation is limited to the terminal internodes up to in <dig>  which essentially corresponds to the primary stem growth region. with the development of vascular cambium and secondary growth, stem elongation ceases while the girth of the stem axis continues to increase. the other secondary meristem, bark/cork cambium, appears much later during stem development and is not detectably represented in the in <dig> sample. secondary growth in this tissue is associated with production of secondary xylem elements and secondary phloem fibers that have well developed secondary walls. however, although a minor component the primary xylem elements in the primary growth region also have some secondary wall formation and associated lignification .

secondary xylem marker genes are upregulated in in9
we assessed our data for quantitative correspondence to published literature. ko et al  <cit>  have identified a core set of  <dig> arabidopsis xylem-predominant genes through a global comparative transcriptome analysis of arabidopsis "secondary growth" tissue, digital northern data from  <dig> organ/tissue types, and digital in situ data from vascular versus epidermal tissue. from these  <dig> "core" arabidopsis genes we identified  <dig> homologous p. trichocarpa gene models on our array, and all but  <dig> genes in the core set had clear p. trichocarpa homologs . more than 80%  of expressed genes in this group  showed more than a 2-fold increase in the internode  <dig> sample  when compared to the internode  <dig> sample . a similar comparison of transcription factors associated with populus and arabidopsis secondary tissue  <cit>  showed that only  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> expressed showed 2-fold or more down-regulation in internode  <dig> compared to internode  <dig> ; in contrast  <dig> genes  showed more than a 2-fold increase. these results also support the biological accuracy and precision of data generated from our array.

global expression profile during stem development
total rna derived from the  <dig> stem internode development series described above was used for expression profiling with a nimblegen microarray representing the whole annotated transcriptome at the time that the array was created. within the  <dig> stem internode samples we could detect the expression of  <dig>  genes out of the  <dig>  represented on the array . to identify statistically significant, differentially expressed genes within the developmental series we used the edge software package  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  populus trichocarpa genes were identified as differentially expressed within the stem developmental series, when a q value cutoff of  <dig>  was employed;  <dig> genes were differentially expressed at a q value cutoff of  <dig>  . to achieve a more stringent gene list we further filtered the  <dig>  genes to remove weakly expressed genes , and also removed genes with a fold-change below two. the resulting  <dig>  genes were considered as differentially expressed in the manuscript, and used for further analysis and clustering. more than 15% of these genes were novel and had no significant blast returns  in tair arabidopsis or ncbi non-redundant sequence databases . as the tissue sampling for this experiment was carried out at one time point during the active growth period, the set of differentially expressed genes might not reflect additional genes that have highly specific patterns of diurnal or seasonal regulation. to validate our differentially expressed gene list, we conducted qrt-pcr on three additional biological replicates using a subset of genes that were at the fdr cutoff of  <dig> . except for one out of the  <dig> genes tested, all showed a positive correlation between microarray and qrt-pcr expression patterns. the microarray and qrt-pcr derived fold-changes between elongation zone  and secondary growth dominant  zones are illustrated in additional file  <dig>  the weakly regulated gene number one, identified as differentially expressed in the microarray dataset, did not show differential expression between in <dig> and in <dig> in the qrt-pcr analysis. as is commonly reported for microarray and qrt-pcr comparisons, the qrt-pcr expression fold-differences for all of the genes, except number  <dig> and  <dig>  were considerably higher than that estimated from microarray data.

the clustering of all regulated genes  showed  three main patterns of gene expression . the collection of genes in cluster number  <dig> mostly showed increasing expression going from in <dig> to in <dig>  with strongest expression in in <dig>  cluster number  <dig> gene expression was dominant in the stem elongation and primary growth region , and tapered off as secondary growth began. cluster number  <dig> genes showed strong upregulation in both in <dig> and in <dig>  with its peak expression for most genes in in <dig>  this group also included some genes that showed more complex expression patterns, with upregulation in younger internodes  in addition to in <dig> 

based on gene expression, the in <dig> sample largely clustered with in <dig> , rather than with the in <dig> sample that is adjacent in the stem. this correlated well with the switch to stem radial growth following activation of secondary growth in in <dig>  thus, most genes are likely to be involved in processes specific to vascular cambium activity and secondary growth. highly expressed genes in these  <dig> clusters include lignin biosynthetic genes, cell wall carbohydrate metabolic genes, arabinogalactan proteins, cytoskeleton-associated genes, and a number of transcription factor genes . other very active genes during secondary growth included transporter genes , proteases, lipid transfer protein and metallothionin-like genes.

the upper quarter of cluster  <dig> shows a sub-cluster of genes that are upregulated mainly in in <dig>  the latter group of genes could be associated predominantly with early stages of secondary growth activity of the cambium. as evident in in <dig> stem cross section , the secondary wall development and lignification of xylem is just beginning in this sample, whereas well developed and lignified walls appear mainly in in <dig> xylem. a highly expressed xyloglucan endotrans glycosylase belonging to this group has been reported to be highly expressed in aspen tension wood and is suggested to be involved in maintaining crosslinks between g and s layers of highly cellulosic tension wood fibers  <cit> . several pectin methyl esterases and a udp-glucose dehydrogenase that are likely involved in pectin and hemicellulose formation are also present within this group.

mirnas have recently been recognized as critical post-transcriptional regulators of plant development and stress response. our array contains only  <dig> mirna precursors based on knowledge at the time of its creation; however,  <dig> mirnas are now reported for poplar . we were able to detect expression for  <dig> of these but only a few showed distinct regulation. mirna <dig>  162a and  <dig> showed secondary development zone dominant expression. mirna <dig> shows the strongest upregulation and is known to control argonaute expression in arabidopsis and poplar  <cit> , which in turn is required for stem cell functioning, organ polarity, and root initiation in arabidopsis  <cit> .

highly expressed genes within cluster number  <dig> include genes associated with primary cell wall synthesis, cell wall loosening/extension, and plant defense. putative cell elongation-related genes within this group include expansins, extensins, a cell elongation protein similar to dwarf <dig>  and an apyrase. dwarf <dig>  <cit>  is a ca/calmodulin-regulated brassinosteroid biosynthetic gene required for cell elongation in arabidopsis  <cit> . apyrases are documented to be involved in cell growth regulation and accumulate in rapidly growing tissues with high auxin concentrations  <cit> . thaumatin and osmotin-like proteins can have β-glucanase functions  <cit> , and are also represented in the elongation zone dominant group. biosynthetic genes that take part in plant secondary metabolite production are also well represented in this group and include several polyphenol oxidases, chlalcone synthases, and flavonol 3-hydroxylases. phenolic and other defense-related genes have also been reported to be upregulated in young sitka spruce stems  <cit> . in addition to the in9-upregulated lipid transfer protein, several others are upregulated in the elongation zone. lipid transfer proteins are abundant lipid binding-capable proteins with diverse proposed  functions  <cit> . these include plant defense, signaling, cuticle biosynthesis, and cell wall loosening  <cit> . most of the lipid transfer proteins upregulated in developing sitka spruce stem were also found in the primary growth region  <cit> .

gene function during early xylem maturation
to help assess the biological function of the regulated genes we identified during the early stages of cambial zone differentiation into xylem, we compared our results to previous studies of gene expression in aspen  <cit> . these studies used high resolution tangential cambial zone cryosectioning, but employed cdna based microarrays that represented only ~30% of predicted gene models in poplar. nonetheless, as discussed below, many genes were in common with the genes we identified.

we compared the genes showing the highest expression ratio in xylem maturation zone cryosections  <cit>  to the differentially expressed gene set in our study. of the  <dig> genes with the highest expression ratio  in the initial maturation zone , we found  <dig> counterparts in our differentially expressed gene set . out of the  <dig> overlapping genes,  <dig> grouped in the in <dig> and in <dig> upregulated gene clusters , supporting their involvement in xylem maturation. the genes' closest hits and arabidopsis homologs are listed in additional file  <dig> and shows a dominant presence of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis, cell wall carbohydrate biosynthesis, and cell wall-associated proteins. other major genes in common included transcription regulators , hormone response genes , and signaling genes , and cytoskeleton-associated genes .

functional roles of differentially expressed genes during stem development
to get a broader perspective on the function of differentially expressed genes, we analyzed for over-representation of gene ontology  categories in each of the three main gene expression pattern clusters identified in figure 4a. the cluster  <dig> genes showed progressive upregulation with secondary growth . biological processes enriched in this group  included several stress and stimulus response genes, secondary metabolic process genes dominated by lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes, and cell death-associated genes. this enrichment should correlate with secondary wall development and terminal stages of xylem development that result in programmed cell death. the molecular function category is also highly enriched in transcription factor and dna binding activity genes, as well as in protein binding activity genes related to cytoskeleton.

cluster  <dig> genes also showed upregulation in both in <dig> and in <dig>  but as opposed to cluster  <dig> peak expression was mainly in in <dig>  this contrast was visible in gene enrichment categories with primary cell wall and early stage secondary cell wall development-related categories showing dominance. the carbohydrate metabolic process and catalytic activity groups include cellulose biosynthesis, hemicelluloses/xylan biosynthetic genes as well as glycosyl group transferase activity and ubiquitin ligase activity-associated genes.

cluster  <dig> genes, mainly upregulated in primary growth dominant in <dig> and in <dig> showed enrichment for many categories of biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. dominant biological process functional categories include active cell growth, development/morphogenesis/differentiation, and metabolic process-associated genes that reflect activities related to primary growth. enrichment of nucleotide metabolism and dna replication related categories could also reflect the high cell division activity during the initiation of cambium in the in <dig> region. the secondary metabolism-enriched group includes flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes.

transcription factor and regulatory genes
there are  <dig>  transcription factors and regulatory genes in two poplar databases , and  <dig>  of these were represented on the array. we found that  <dig> genes were expressed at detectable levels in at least one of the  <dig> internode samples. figure 4b shows the clustering of  <dig> transcription factors that are differentially regulated during stem development . a recent related study on transcriptome changes during shoot organogenesis in populus identified a comparable number  of regulated transcription factors  <cit> . we could recognize clusters upregulated in in5-in <dig>  and in in2-in <dig>  the majority of regulated transcription factors  that were upregulated correlated with the onset of secondary growth.

transcription factors that are predominantly expressed during vascular development and secondary growth are of considerable interest due to the economic importance of wood and wood fibers. as regulators that help to control response networks, they may be important tools for modifying wood or fiber qualities. schrader et al.  <cit>  have reported high resolution transcription maps of aspen wood forming tissue and have identified potential regulators of xylem differentiation. many transcription factor and gene regulator classes have been reported in the literature to play a role in vascular and xylem development in different plant species . we selected all expressed genes belonging to these gene families in poplar and displayed their expression as a cluster diagrams . the sub-clusters of genes expressed in association with secondary growth of each gene family are illustrated separately in figure  <dig> 

with  <dig> identified members, myb and myb-like genes are the largest transcription factor family in poplar. out of the  <dig> genes expressed in developing stems, more than 50% show secondary growth-associated expression patterns. mybs are implicated as critical regulators of vascular differentiation and phenylpropanoid metabolism in plants, including the tree genera picea, pinus, eucalyptus and populus  <cit> . overexpression of pinus mybs have resulted in ectopic lignification in tobacco  <cit> . the secondary wall biosynthesis-regulating arabidopsis myb <dig> has also been demonstrated to be a direct target of the secondary wall-associated nac domain transcription factor snd <dig>  <cit> , further elaborating the network of interactions. the populus trichocarpa homologue of arabidopsis myb <dig>  gw <dig> ix. <dig>  is also uprgulated in in <dig>  in <dig> samples . the complete group of secondary growth-associated myb family members is identified in figure  <dig> 

similar to mybs, nearly 50% of expressed nacs, one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor families, were upregulated during secondary growth . arabidopsis nacs, vnd, and nst groups of genes have preferred expression in vascular tissue, and have been identified as regulators of xylem vessel element differentiation and secondary wall formation in 'secondary growth' tissue of arabidopsis  <cit> . the ectopic expression of vnd <dig>  vnd <dig>  nst <dig>  nst <dig> and nst3/snd <dig> have induced transdifferentiation of various cells to produce thick secondary walls  <cit> . the  <dig> vnds and  <dig> nsts fall into separate phylogenetic branches but are grouped in the same subfamily of nac proteins  <cit> . although all putative populus homologues of vnd and nst are not regulated in our dataset, vnd <dig> and vnd <dig> homologues gw <dig> vii. <dig>  and gw <dig> . <dig> -jgi and nst3/snd <dig> homologue gw <dig> i. <dig>  are upregulated in in <dig> and in <dig> samples . these genes were also specifically upregulated in xylem tissue in a populus tissue-type dataset , further supporting their role in vascular differentiation. figure  <dig> illustrates more undescribed populus nac gene family members that show strong secondary growth-associated upregulation.

the homeodomain-containing superfamily of transcription factors participate in a wide variety of plant developmental processes. the leucine zipper-associated hd-zip, wushel-related wox, knotted-related knox, and zinc finger-associated zf-hd homeodomain containing transcription factors have been associated with processes related to meristem function, organ polarity, and vascular development in several species  <cit> . ko et al.  <cit>  have shown that a hybrid aspen class iii hd-zip protein, pt-hb <dig> was closely associated with wood formation and that it was tightly regulated over developmental and seasonal gradients, with highest expression during the active growing season. a populus trichocara homologue of aspen pt-hb <dig>  estext_genewise1_v <dig> c_ <dig>  was within the in <dig>  in <dig> upregulated cluster , and we also found additional homeodomain superfamily members  that were strongly upregulated during secondary growth.

bzip transcription factors play critical roles in regulating plant defense responses and development  <cit> . in addition to being upregulated during eucalyptus xylem development  <cit> , the bzip family has been identified as one of the transcription factor families most regulated during arabidopsis stem development  <cit> , with two specific candidates associated with xylem fiber differentiation. poplar homologs of these two bzip transcription factors are also represented within the many secondary growth-associated clusters of bzip genes in figure  <dig> 

although wrky transcription factors are mainly implicated in regulating defense signaling  <cit> , they have also been identified to be upregulated in arabidopsis stem secondary growth and xylem tissue  <cit>  and in aspen tension wood  <cit> . the wrky family is highly diversified in plants. there were  <dig> poplar wrky members that were upregulated during secondary growth, of a total of  <dig> total members in poplar. the functional study of this subset would help to expand knowledge of the diversity of wrky developmental functions in plants.

there were  <dig> lim genes associated with secondary development . lim domain proteins in eukaryotes act as regulators of transcription, or in organization of the cytoskeleton. tobacco ntwlim <dig> binds f-actin and has been suggested to be involved in actin cytoskeleton stabilization  <cit> . in sunflower haplim <dig> is found in actin-enriched cells, and exhibits non-specific dna and rna binding activity  <cit> . tobacco ntlim <dig> has been demonstrated to act as a transcription factor and is able to bind the conserved pal-box found in promoters of many phenylpropanoid pathway genes  <cit> . down regulation of ntlim <dig> in tobacco also results in reduced lignin and decreased expression of phenylpropanoid genes. in poplar some lim genes have been reported to be upregulated in tension wood  <cit> . both the cytoskeletal component binding and transcription regulating activity of these genes can influence the lignin biosynthetic pathway, and thus influence secondary cell wall properties that affect wood quality and warrants further study into the secondary development associated lim genes illustrated in figure  <dig> 

the few mads box gene family members that were upregulated during secondary growth are illustrated in figure  <dig>  mads box genes are well known for their involvement in reproductive development in many plants, and have also been shown to be important in vegetative development and dormancy in poplar  <cit> . the seasonal expression pattern of aspen mads-box <dig>  that is also represented in the secondary growth-associated cluster of poplar genes  is specific to developing vascular tissue, including vascular cambium. it interacts with other mads box proteins and an actin depolymerizing factor, to perhaps play a major in control of woody tissue development  <cit> .

an ethylene response element binding factor-like gene that belongs to ap2/erf domain transcription factor class is one of the most strongly regulated genes in secondary growth dominant cluster  <dig> . it has also been identified in aspen  <cit>  as differentially expressed and phloem localized in secondary tissue. ap2/erf family members are known to be involved in integration of jasmonic acid and ethylene signals in plant defense  <cit> , but also have members  that affect cell expansion, proliferation and differentiation pathways in arabidopsis  <cit> .

carbohydrate active enzymes 
cazymes http://www.cazy.org include the large families of glycosyl transferases  and glycosyl hydrolases , as well as two small families of polysaccharide lyases  and carbohydrate esterases . the full compliment of populus cazymes  have been identified and reviewed in  <cit>  and expression was analyzed for some families in  <cit> . plants have more cazymes than other organisms, and they are involved in diverse functions. these include assimilation of photosynthetic products, synthesis of various cell wall polymers, and synthesis and conversion of glycosylated compounds. approximately 40% of the cazymes identified in the populus trichocarpa genome are represented in populus est collections  <cit> . our data indicated that 71% of all cazymes identified on the array are expressed during stem development . the expression of both gts and ghs show relatively small clusters of genes that are associated with secondary growth , and these could be gene family members associated with secondary wall metabolism. in contrast, a large proportion of ghs show elongation zone dominant expression patterns. some members of this group could be involved in primary cell wall metabolism, cell wall loosening, and cell elongation. the poplar homologues of arabidopsis fra <dig>  irx <dig> and irx <dig>  and glucuronoxylan biosynthesis-secondary wall localized gt family genes  <cit>  have also been localized to aspen secondary wall containing cells  <cit> . these three genes are grouped with the secondary growth-associated cluster of genes during stem development .

pectins include chemically diverse polymers that are major components of cell walls. they are important for wall plasticity and cell adhesion, and are major constituent of primary walls of poplar  <cit>  that undergo substantial remodeling during development  <cit> . in addition to some ghs, members of ce and pe gene families are involved in pectin de-esterification/acetylation and pectin degradation. siedlecka et al.  <cit>  have shown that aspen pectin methyl transferases are involved in intrusive and symplastic cell growth in developing wood cells. the small clusters of pl and ce gene family members that are preferentially expressed in the elongation zone  are possible candidates for control of pectin restructuring during stem elongation. the secondary growth-associated small clusters of pl and ce gene families are likely to be involved in pectin remodeling during the early stages of secondary wall biosynthesis and radial and intrusive growth of cambial derivatives. this would be applicable to the ce family members that show highest expression in in <dig> 

we have illustrated the expression pattern of all expressed cellulose synthase  and hemicellulose-related cellulose synthase-like  genes in figure  <dig>  these were separated from other gt family members due to their importance in cellulose and hemicellulose biosynthesis. populus cesa and csl genes have been investigated earlier for family structure and expression in different tissue types  <cit> , which led to the identification of a few members that are highly expressed in xylem tissue. our results show a cluster of four genes that are highly expressed in the secondary growth zone that are homologous to arabidopsis irx <dig> , irx <dig>  and irx <dig>  that are known essential components of cellulose synthesizing complex in arabidopsis . in addition, we could recognize a cluster predominantly expressed in the elongation zone and a cluster with dominant expression in in <dig> in addition to elongation zone. these gene family members could preferentially be involved in primary cell wall synthesis during primary growth and secondary growth, respectively.

expansins and extensins
expansins are considered one of the primary regulators of plant cell expansion and loosening  <cit> . α-expansins are abundant in aspen secondary xylem  <cit> , and ectopic expression promotes cell expansion in both primary and secondary tissue of aspen  <cit> . clustering showed a distinct group of five genes with secondary growth dominant expression, and a few other clusters with elongation zone only, or elongation zone and in <dig> dominant expression 

extensins are cell wall structural proteins that take part in plant pathogen response and plant cell wall assembly, acting as scaffolds  <cit> . during poplar stem development a large proportion of extensin family members are preferentially expressed in the elongation zone, with in <dig> sample showing the highest expression .

cytoskeletal components
the cytoskeleton plays an essential role in guiding and trafficking cellulose synthase complexes during cellulose deposition in secondary cell walls  <cit> . in developing xylem cells, microtubule bundles maintain the cellulose synthase complexes beneath the sites of secondary wall synthesis, while actin is required for delivery and rapid trafficking of complex-containing organelles around the cell  <cit> . xylem fiber localized tubulin gene family members in eucalyptus and populus have also been reported to play a role in determining the cellulose microfibril orientation and angle, a determinant of wood fiber and timber quality  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the distinct groups of gene family members associated with secondary growth for actin, tubulin, and actin depolymerizing factor gene families. α- and β-tubulin genes that were upregulated in xylem and during tension wood formation  <cit>  are within the secondary growth dominant group of genes in figure  <dig>  the similar upregulation of cell wall-associated cellulose synthase genes, and a korrigan endoglucanase, in induced aspen tension wood  <cit>  has led to suggest coordinated regulation of tubulin genes with cellulose biosynthesis machinery  <cit> . a smaller number of tubulin genes also showed preferential expression in the elongation zone.

fasciclin like-agp
arabinogalactan proteins  belong to the large family of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  and also include extensins , proline/hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, and lectins  <cit> . fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins are a subclass of agps containing domains that resemble drosophila fasciclin cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . several fasciclin like-agps have been associated with wood formation and are preferentially expressed in differentiating xylem in several species, including populus  <cit> . figure 10a illustrates that all gene family members except three are preferentially expressed in the wood forming in <dig> sample. the lack of strong upregulation of this group of genes in the in <dig> sample, and the exclusive expression of this group in xylem from a tissue type gene expression dataset , illustrates its predominant role in xylem secondary wall biogenesis. two genes showed high expression in the in <dig> sample as opposed to in <dig> 

phenylpropanoid and lignin-related genes
an expression cluster diagram of phenylpropanoid genes identified in the poplar genome  <cit>  is given in figure  <dig>  as expected, most lignin-related phenylpropanoid genes are predominantly expressed in the secondary growth zone. a small group that includes two phenylalanine amonnia lyases , a coumaroyl 3-hydroxylase cyp98a <dig> , four hydroxycinnamoyl coa shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferases , and two 4-coumarate:coa ligases  are expressed predominantly in the elongation zone. these enzymes are involved in the early steps of phenylpropanoid metabolism and are likely involved in the biosynthesis of non-lignin components of phenylpropanoid derivatives such as phenolic esters and glycosides, condensed tannins, and flavonoid precursors. these are well known to have a variety of tissue abundances and complex responses to environment  <cit>  that are mostly related to pathogen defense and protective functions.

CONCLUSIONS
we have documented the transcriptome changes that occur during the transition from primary to secondary growth using sequential stem developmental stages. more than  <dig>  genes were identified as differentially expressed, which is likely to be a conservative estimate due to the use of two biological replicates. our results provide an extensive catalog of regulatory factors and cell wall biogenesis genes involved in stem elongation and secondary growth phase of tree development, whose potential applications include candidate genes for study of natural polymorphisms, targets for reverse genetic studies of tree development, and tools for marker-aided breeding or genetic engineering of tree growth and wood quality. the transcriptome patterns provided will also aid in making functional interpretations for the vast number of genes that have poorly known biochemical and developmental functions.
