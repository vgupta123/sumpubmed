BACKGROUND
euphausiacea  are small shrimplike crustaceans that are abundant in the pelagic ecosystems of all oceans. there are about  <dig> species of euphausiacea, making this one of the smallest orders in the class of malacostraca  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the eumalacostraca orders based on 28s rdna sequences suggests that euphausiacea are more closely related to mysida than to the decapoda  <cit> .

in the southern ocean, krill is a critical link between primary productivity and most of the predators at higher trophic levels such as birds, fish, seals, squid and whales  <cit> . the krill biomass in the southern ocean has been estimated at 400– <dig> million tons with sustainable annual harvest at around 70– <dig> million tons. therefore, krill biomass that could be available for human food is comparable to the biomass of all the other aquatic species currently fished by humans, but only six species of krill are at present harvested commercially  <cit> . commercial fishing of krill is done in the southern ocean and around japan. the global annual production amounts to  <dig> –  <dig>  tons, most of this from the scotia sea  <cit> . most of the fished krill is used for aquaculture and aquarium feedings, as baits in sport fishing, or in the pharmaceutical industry.

the antarctic krill  has a circumpolar distribution with the highest concentrations in the atlantic sector of the southern ocean. it is a key species of the antarctic ecosystem and plays an important role both as feeder of algae, bacteria and micro-zooplancton and as a prey of vertebrates  <cit> . e. superba displays a large daily vertical migration that occurs generally within the upper  <dig> m water column making a significant amount of biomass available as food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day  <cit> . basic knowledge of crustacean biology is limited by the lack of information about their genomes. considering all orders in the class of malacostraca, no genome has yet been fully sequenced. at present genbank carries  <dig>  nucleotide and  <dig>  protein sequences , with a high rate of redundancy. currently only  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> protein sequences have been identified in euphausiacea . specifically for e. superba only  <dig> nucleotide and  <dig> amino acid sequences have been obtained; they identify key proteins and enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation  and of phototransduction . in the subphylum crustacea there are  <dig> complete  mitochondrial dna sequences:  <dig> branchiopoda,  <dig> maxillopoda,  <dig> malacostraca, and one of ostracoda, cephalocarida and remipedia . in a previous investigation machida et al.  <cit>  determined the nearly complete dna sequence of the mitochondrial genome of e. superba .

the identification of novel shrimp genes by systematic sequencing of genomic dna is hindered by the dispersion of the genes among large non-coding regions and by the presence of introns within genes. current genomics technologies, like sage  <cit> , differential display  <cit>  and systematic sequencing of expressed sequence tags  <cit> , are very useful approaches to identify protein coding genes rapidly on a large scale. moreover, the frequency of a given sequence in the sage or cdna libraries can be related to the relative abundance of the corresponding mrna, giving an indication of the level of gene expression  <cit> .

the aim of our study was to significantly increase the number of krill genes in the public database and to discover tissue specific genes. for this purpose we have produced and sequenced five cdna libraries from different antarctic krill tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores. we have developed special cdna libraries optimized to directionally cloning full-length cdna in plasmid vectors without enzymatic digestion. we have identified  <dig>  high-quality est clones that have been grouped in  <dig>  different clusters. of these,  <dig> clusters were successfully annotated while  <dig> did not show a significant similarity with known genes from other organisms. clusters, consensus and related similarity and gene ontology searches were organized in a dedicated e. superba database  <cit> .

RESULTS
construction of cdna libraries and est analysis
total rna was independently isolated from tissues  dissected from specimens of e. superba collected at five different time points during  <dig> hours. the analysis of total rna samples, performed by capillary electrophoresis, showed absence of genomic dna contamination and a peculiar electropherogram as shown in fig.  <dig>  in particular, total rnas show low molecular weight from  <dig> bp to  <dig> kb, perhaps as result of a partial rna degradation.

five independent tissue-specific cdna libraries, named k <dig> and k <dig> , k <dig> , k <dig>  and k <dig> , were produced from total rna pools. for head we have sequenced only k <dig> cdna library because it presented more recombinant clones compared to k <dig>  recombinant bacterial clones from each library were randomly picked and the est were sequenced from the 5'-end. the average insert size for all libraries was estimated to be  <dig> bp.

est assembly and construction of an antarctic krill transcript catalogue
a total of  <dig>  ests were initially analyzed for sequence quality and vector sequences were recognized and deleted. two-hundred-seventy-six low quality ests were removed and  <dig>   high-quality ests were further processed. these ests assembled by similarity into  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singletons, resulting in a total of  <dig>  non-redundant  sequences. a list of the sequencing trend for each cdna library is presented in table  <dig>  interestingly, we obtained a low percentage of clusters composed by ≥  <dig> ests from cdna libraries prepared from the krill head  showing that no specific transcripts are particularly enriched in this tissue. as expected from the above data, the head reveals a higher percentage  of new putative transcripts, with respect to abdomen , photophores  and thoracopods  in which the presence of enriched transcripts was instead revealed by est sequencing.

total ests = number of produced chromatograms; discarded ests = number of low quality ests; analyzed ests = number of sequences processed for clustering; # genbank = accession numbers of ests deposited in genbank; # est in cluster = number of sequences in cluster; # clusters = total number of clusters; # singletons = number of putative transcripts identified by one est; # consensus = number of non-redundant sequences; % redundancy = percentage of sequences not identified in an exclusive manner; % discovery = percentage of ests identifying putative new transcripts in the total est analyzed.

the number of ests in each cluster varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the average length of a cluster is  <dig> bp with the longest assembled sequence being  <dig>  bp and the shortest  <dig> bp. the 91% of cluster consensus contains the 3'-end region of mrnas as demonstrated by the presence of a poly-adenylation signal.

each non redundant sequence was searched in the nucleotides database and uniprotkb database using blast-n and blast-x with an e-value cut off of < e- <dig> and < e- <dig>  respectively. these values were empirically chosen considering the low amount of sequences data available for euphausiacea and similar shrimp species and the need of stringency in providing a reliable catalogue of antarctic krill genes. all annotations were further manually examined, in order to assign the best describing text to the correspondent cluster.

overall, 70% of non-redundant sequences , identified by about 50% of total produced ests, showed no or poor similarity matches, and they probably represent completely unknown antarctic krill transcripts that could be characterized in future studies. additional file  <dig> lists the  <dig>  non-redundant sequences identifying known euphausia genes or sequences showing significant similarity to genes from arthropods  and other species , such as homarus americanus , aedes aegypti , drosophila melanogaster , bombyx mori , brachydanio rerio , mus musculus , rattus norvegicus , homo sapiens . antarctic krill sequences generally show a greater similarity to genes of insects  than to genes of malacostraca  and only 7% were similar to the known sequences of euphausiacea. this result could be due to the limited number of malacostraca gene and protein sequences available in the public databases  respect to insects . the total collection of  <dig>  e. superba 3'-est has been deposited in the ebi-genbank-dbj database .

one of the most noticeable features of our est catalogue is that mitochondrial transcripts are quite abundant :  <dig> ests  matched with nine different e. superba mitochondrial transcripts  and about 5% ests  identified the large mitochondrial 16s rrna gene. in future experiments, to avoid the repetitive sequencing of this abundant mrna, we plan to introduce, during cdna insert amplification, interference primers specifically designed for the 16s rrna  <cit> . moreover, we found a small percentage of ests , showing similarity with 18s and 28s rrna. about 2% of ribosomal rnas contamination is common to other systematic sequencing projects.

the e. superba mitochondrial gene sequences are very similar to those commonly found in the mitochondrial genomes of other arthropods, including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna and  <dig> rrna genes  <cit> . machida et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that mitochondrial protein-coding genes are transcribed from the same dna strand, left to right, except for nd <dig>  nd4l, nd <dig> and nd <dig> genes, while two ribosomal rna genes are encoded by l strands.

we did not find highly represented tissue-specific mrnas, while some ribosomal proteins like l <dig> , s <dig> , p <dig> , l37a , l <dig> , p <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig> , l <dig>  were expressed at the same level in all analyzed krill tissues. the only genuine tissue-specific mrna appears to be myosin light chain  that is highly represented in a strictly committed tissue such as skeletal muscle localized in abdomen . moreover, we found  <dig> unknown transcripts among the  <dig> most expressed genes: krc <dig> , krc <dig>  and krc <dig>  that could be interesting for future functional studies.

since very few abundant transcripts were found that could hamper the identification of rare transcripts, it seems plausible that random sequencing of our antarctic krill libraries would continue to represent an effective strategy for identifying novel e. superba mrnas.

functional categorization of e. superba ests
in order to facilitate functional genomic studies in antarctic krill,  <dig> consensus sequences showing similarity with known genes or proteins were grouped into  <dig> functional categories  according to gene ontology  <cit>  and other resources developed for gene functional annotation  <cit> . a list of all annotated transcripts is shown in additional file  <dig>  a large majority of ests , displaying putative identity with ribosomal sequences and genes for the translation machinery, were grouped in the translation functional category, characterized by 8% of all known transcripts. we found genes with regulative functions in the translational initiation, like translation factor sui <dig> initiation factor 4a and  <dig>  in the translational elongation like elongation factor 1α, 1β,  <dig> and a specific tail muscle elongation factor 1γ. other abundant e. superba sequences fall into gene categories related to cell structure, cell motility and functional homeostasis. for instance, genes involved in the mechanisms of dna transcription , transport , skeletal muscle contraction , and in amino acid, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism  are comprised in this category. this class includes also sec <dig> β-subunit, an important transport protein that plays a crucial role in the insertion of secretory and membrane polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and cellular retinoic acid/retinol binding protein , involved in the transport of retinol from the digestive gland to peripheral tissues  <cit> . a transcript included in this class  shows a good similarity with hemocyanin, the main oxygen carrier molecule in arthropods and molluscs  <cit> .

the last four columns of the table show respectively number and percentage of clusters and ests belonging to each functional category.

other interesting krill transcripts that we were able to annotate are those involved in stress responses, proteolysis and immunoresponse  like hsp <dig>  chaperones, cathepsine l-like cysteine protease, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase  <cit> , peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase a <dig>  and peptidylprolyl isomerase b . cyclophilines are members of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. ests with good similarity to hemocyanin are present in our collection: this protein has been recently reported to have antifungal and antiviral activities  <cit> .

some krill ests identify histone 2a  and histone  <dig> a  indicating the presence of unexpected polyadenylated histone transcripts displaying the polyadenylation signal and tail. in vertebrates, these evolutionary conserved housekeeping mrnas are not polyadenylated, and this has been related to the high turnover of these transcripts in the dividing cells. interestingly, polyadenylated h2a and h <dig> histone sequences were detected also in the systematic sequencing of 3'-end cdna libraries obtained from brain and kidney of channel catfish ictarulus punctatus  <cit>  and from various tissues  of the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis  <cit> . the presence of polyadenylation signals in e. superba histone transcripts deserves a more detailed analysis. in fact, eirin-lopez et al.  <cit>  have recently shown that all histone genes in the repetitive unit are characterized by two different mrna termination signals in their 3' utr: the typical stem-loop or hairpin-loop signal followed by a purine-rich element and a polyadenylation signal aataaa located downstream to this last element. the presence of a double mrna termination signal is unique to histone genes and common for other invertebrates such as chironomus thummi  <cit> , d. melanogaster  <cit> , chaetopterus variopedatus  <cit> , m. galloprovincialis  <cit>  and crustacea  <cit> . although in some invertebrates core histone transcripts  include polya tails, these sequences are among the most evolutionary conserved eukaryotic proteins  <cit> .

transcriptional signature of e. superba tissues
gene expression profiling depends on the functional specificity of cells composing different tissues. so, the systematic sequencing of est from unbiased cdna libraries is a suitable approach for analyzing the gene expression profile of a given tissue  <cit> . in fact, the frequency of a given est in the cdna library can be related to the relative abundance of the corresponding mrna in the source tissue.

to define tissue transcriptional signatures of e. superba, annotated ests obtained from the four tissue-specific cdna libraries  were separately grouped in  <dig> functional categories  a further abundant category was created for those ests to which no function may be yet associated. fig.  <dig> shows four different diagrams standing for ests distribution among functional categories in each cdna library. the presence of highly represented functional categories is peculiar of strictly committed tissues such as abdomen and thoracopods in which transcripts involved in striated muscle contraction are very abundant . in the abdomen library, we were able to recognize the principal structural components of the sarcomeric contractile machinery  and two subunits of the troponin complex , a key regulator of muscle contraction. about 10% of sequences produced from head and thoracopods libraries fall in functional categories related to metabolic processes . interestingly, about 6% and 4% of ests respectively sequenced from head and thoracopods libraries identified structural constituents of cuticle . this reflects the presence of cuticle traces in the head and thoracopods samples. in photophores and thoracopods transcripts displaying putative identity with ribosomal sequences are more abundant compared to other tissues , indicating a relevant activity of the translation machinery.

table showing the number and the percentage of ests in each functional category for each tissue specific library

we have also identified from the head cdna library a novel opsin sequence , a light-sensitive membrane-bound g protein-coupled receptors mediating the conversion of a photon of light into an electrochemical signal in the visual transduction cascade. in insects there are at least four main spectral classes: long-wavelenght-sensitive , middle-wavelenght-sensitive  and two short-wavelenght-sensitive  groups. the opsin sequences available for e. superba  show a spectral sensitivity with short wavelength  and cannot be aligned with our consensus  <cit> .

quantitative rt-pcr analysis was performed to quantify and validate the expression level of some genes presenting different est countings in krill tissues. we selected ten genes  representative of different levels of transcript abundance.

the housekeeping gene 18s rrna was used as endogenous control. as reported in the additional file  <dig>  the expression values obtained with the quantitative rt-pcr for the tested transcripts were in agreement with the est counting in the four libraries. in particular, we have demonstrated that the compound eye opsin is strongly expressed in head compared to other tissues and myosin light chain and myosin heavy chain are highly expressed in abdomen and thoracopods confirming their key role in the contractile machinery. instead, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4a is expressed at about the same level in all tested tissues.

identification of microsatellite-containing ests
among the  <dig>  non-redundant sequences examined in this study,  <dig>  consensus sequences containing ests were identified by using misa software. twelve of these consensus present  <dig> distinct simple sequence repeats interrupted by more than  <dig> bp for a total of  <dig> identified microsatellites . the majority of these sequences  fall into the  <dig> bp repeat type class with a preponderance of gaa and gat. after a manual inspection of redundancy, raw sequence, data quality and the presence of sufficient flanking sequences we designed  <dig> pairs of specific pcr primers. we obtained successful amplifications for  <dig> of these  <dig> pairs of primers. assessment of polymorphism information content , observed and expected heterozygosity and other population genetics analysis will be performed in the near future. these markers will increase the currently available euphausiacea ssr markers. in fact, only five microsatellite loci isolated from the northern krill meganyctiphanes norvegica have been reported so far  <cit> . since our novel microsatellite markers were developed on the basis of expressed sequences and they are presumably conserved across other euphausiacea species, they could also be useful for comparative mapping and for a molecular approach to antarctic krill ecology.

CONCLUSIONS
since genome sequencing and bac libraries of antarctic krill are not yet available, est sequencing from randomly selected cdna clones represents a powerful approach to identify large numbers of transcripts that could be used in gene expression and functional genomics studies  <cit> . the systematic sequencing of four cdna libraries prepared from different e. superba tissues has allowed us to establish an est database containing  <dig>  unique sequences. over 65% of the antarctic krill sequences resulted in no blast matches with published sequences and they probably represent novel genes that could be functionally characterized. we have defined the transcriptional signatures of krill tissues and performed qrt-pcr to validate the level of expression of ten representative genes. all sequencing data have been deposited on the e. superba est database available from our web site  <cit> . in addition, the est collection is a potential source for the development of genetic markers including microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphisms. among the  <dig>  unique sequences,  <dig>  unique microsatellite containing ests were identified by using misa software. moreover, we have designed and successfully tested  <dig> pairs of specific pcr primers for microsatellite loci.

our est catalogue could provide a source for the design of microarray platform that will allow the study of the transcriptional responses of this abundant marine organism to environmental challenges  <cit> .
