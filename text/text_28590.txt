BACKGROUND
dna markers are invaluable tools across many species for use in qtl mapping, marker assisted selection, association analysis, and fine mapping for cloning of genes of interest. by far the most abundant source of dna variation for marker development is the single nucleotide polymorphism . the snp marker has become the marker of choice for many research applications because of the abundance of snps and the several technologies available for the high-multiplex assay of snps  <cit> . the existence of high-throughput methods for assaying snps is continually reducing the cost of genotyping and is making these high-throughput methods accessible to more researchers. however, the cost of snp discovery still remains relatively high, especially for organisms that do not have a sequenced genome. thus, this cheaper high-throughput genotyping technology is unavailable to many researchers.

snp discovery in most species has generally relied upon in silico analysis of existing sequence data or the resequencing of a small number of genotypes for the identification of sequence variants in existing sequence data  <cit> . while these methods of resequencing have been successful for snp discovery, they are time consuming and expensive. recently, this has changed due to the availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies.

for complex animal and plant genomes such as cattle and soybean, high-throughput snp discovery has been demonstrated using the next generation sequencing on the genome analyzer  platform from illumina, inc.   <cit> . in both cattle and soybean, ga sequencing was performed on reduced representation libraries  which reduced the complexity of the portion of the genome that was sequenced after a restriction digestion of the dna and a size selection of a proportion of the resulting dna fragments  <cit> . in cattle this approach successfully identified  <dig>  putative snps shown to have a 91% validation rate  <cit> . in soybean  <dig>  to  <dig>  snps were predicted with a validation rate ranging from 79% to  <dig> %  <cit> . while the use of next-generation sequencing to sequence rrl appears to be very efficient for snp discovery, a whole genome sequence for the alignment is still required because of the short read lengths produced by ga sequencing.

many animal and plant species do not have whole genome sequences available; thus, scientists working with these species have not been able to fully take advantage of next generation sequencing for snp discovery. one such species is common bean , a predominantly self-pollinating crop of world-wide importance for its nutritional value. because relatively limited resources have been devoted to marker development in common bean, there are currently few snp markers available  <cit>  for genetic improvement. our objective was to create a multi-tier reduced representation library  through a series of restriction digestions and gel size selection followed by high-throughput dna sequencing for the discovery of large numbers of snps in common bean with sufficient flanking sequence for goldengate assay design.

RESULTS
to accomplish snp discovery using only sequence produced by next generation sequence analysis, mtrrls were created of the common bean genotypes jalo eep  <dig> and bat  <dig>  the first tier restriction consisted of digesting jalo eep  <dig> dna with three restriction enzymes followed by gel size selection of the  <dig> to  <dig> bp dna fragments. the sequencing of the first tier size selected dna was performed using the roche 454-flx sequencing method  <cit>   to produce the genomic reference sequence. this genomic reference sequence would be used to align ga sequencing reads produced by sequencing the  <dig> to  <dig> bp gel size selected dna fragments. the  <dig> to  <dig> bp size selected dna fragments were produced from a series of restriction digestions performed on the  <dig> to  <dig> bp dna fragments, first tier restriction, of both the jalo eep  <dig> and bat  <dig> genotypes . the discovery of snps that occur toward the middle of the  <dig> reference sequence would then have sufficient flanking sequence for goldengate assay design.

 <dig> sequencing
a total of  <dig>  reads were obtained from one run of the  <dig> sequencer to yield  <dig> mbp of dna sequence of the cultivar jalo eep  <dig>  the sequence was assembled into  <dig>  reference sequences, including  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singleton sequences. a total of  <dig> contigs/singletons  that aligned with chloroplast or mitochondrial dna were eliminated as were  <dig>  contigs/singletons  which were less than  <dig> bases or with "n" for more than 75% of their total length leaving  <dig> % of the reads with an average quality score greater than  <dig>  this resulted in  <dig>  contigs/singletons with a total length of  <dig> mbp, an average length of  <dig> bp per sequence read and a median length of  <dig> 

illumina ga sequencing and alignment to the  <dig> sequences
a total of  <dig>  mbp of bat  <dig> and  <dig>  mbp of jalo eep  <dig> dna sequence was obtained from the ga sequencing. the length of individual reads ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. the sequences were aligned with the  <dig> reference sequences using the software program eland.

snp discovery and validation
a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads or  <dig> mbp bat  <dig> ga sequences were aligned to jalo eep  <dig>   <dig> sequencer consensus and singleton reads. this alignment identified  <dig>  snps with minimum quality score of  <dig> and read depth of  <dig> using the casava software. no insertion/deletions  were called since a common sequencing error of the 454-flx system is miscalling the number of bases in homopolymers  <cit>  and the goldengate assay is not able to assay indels.

by mapping and assembling the jalo eep  <dig> reference sequences with jalo eep  <dig> short reads, snps from homologous or paralogous regions could be identified. a total of  <dig>  snps from such regions were eliminated from the  <dig>  snps that were initially identified.

for the remaining  <dig>  candidate snps, the snp allele in the jalo eep  <dig> reference sequence was replaced with the bat  <dig> allele and the jalo eep  <dig> ga short reads were aligned to the bat  <dig> allele consensus sequence. this step resulted in confirming a total of  <dig>  snps of the  <dig>  candidate snps.

the snp number was further reduced to  <dig>  after filtering the snps residing in the fragments which were significantly aligned with repetitive sequences http://phaseolus.genomics.purdue.edu/data/pv_gba_recon_repeats.fasta . since the roots that were used for dna extraction were collected from unsterilized soil, the remaining snps were also screened for bacterial sequences from genbank which eliminated an additional  <dig> snps.

a total of  <dig> primer pairs were designed to  <dig> randomly chosen snps out of the  <dig>  candidate snps. a total of  <dig> primer pairs produced a good robust sequence tagged site with high quality sequence surrounding the candidate snp. of the  <dig> candidate snps,  <dig>  contained the predicted snp.

goldengate snp validation
before the  <dig>  snps were submitted to illumina for goldengate assay design they were further screened to ensure that all bat  <dig> ga sequences only contained one allele for each candidate snp. of the  <dig>  snps called by casava using three or more ga sequences, there was  <dig> snps that were eliminated because at least one ga sequence had a different allele than the called bat  <dig> consensus base. the remaining  <dig>  snps  were submitted for scoring by the illumina goldengate assay design tool. of the  <dig>  snps,  <dig>  had a snp score ≥  <dig>  which illumina uses to predict a moderate rate of success for obtaining a successful goldengate assay of which  <dig>  had a snp score ≥  <dig>  which illumina uses to predict a high rate of success for converting a snp into a working goldengate assay.

to design a  <dig>  goldengate assay,  <dig>  candidate snps were chosen which had a snp score ≥  <dig>  and an average snp score of  <dig> . the remaining  <dig> snps were snps discovered through sanger resequencing and were not part of the validation for this project . the  <dig>  goldengate assay named pvopa- <dig>  produced  <dig> successful goldengate assays out of the  <dig>  candidate snps. a total of  <dig> of these successful goldengate assays were found to be polymorphic between bat  <dig> and jalo eep  <dig>  while the five other successful goldengate assays were polymorphic in a set of  <dig> diverse common bean germplasm accessions. these five additional polymorphic markers were likely not polymorphic between bat  <dig> and jalo eep  <dig> due to residual heterogeneity in these two lines and the dna used for the sequencing was a separate extraction from the dna that was used for the goldengate analysis.

discussion
the multi-tier reduced representation library successfully took advantage of the strengths of two next generation sequencing methods. the main advantage of the 454-flx system is the generation of longer reads than the ga system. maughan et al.,  <cit>  were able to sequence a reduced representation library using only the 454-flx system for snp discovery in amaranth in which they estimated that their rrl represented  <dig> mbp of the  <dig> mbp genome. the sequencing of the first tier in the common bean rrl produced  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singleton sequences. after elimination of chloroplast and mitochondrial dna a total of  <dig> mbp of unique sequence was obtained. the high number of singleton sequences and the lack of read-depth in the contigs likely indicated that this  <dig> mbp did not include all fragments that were in the  <dig> to  <dig> bp size range. since our reduced representation library likely contains a larger proportion of the estimated  <dig> mb common bean genome  <cit>  than maughan et al.,  <cit>  isolated from amaranth an additional sequence run of the 454-flx system on a second genotype was unlikely to be sufficient for snp discovery in common bean. the isolation of a larger proportion of the genome was expected since three restriction enzymes were used in the first restriction digestion instead of a single enzyme as has been used in previous studies  <cit> .

the advantage of the ga system is that it produces millions more reads than the 454-flx system at a much lower cost but these reads are considerably shorter. while sequencing the first tier with 454-flx system alone was inefficient for snp discovery in common bean, it did produce  <dig> to  <dig> bp sequences which we were able to utilize as a reference sequence to align the shorter, but much more numerous, ga sequences. the further reduction of the  <dig> to  <dig> bp first-tier fraction to  <dig> to  <dig> bp fragments allowed the end sequencing of those fragments with the ga system. this smaller second-tier fraction derived from the  <dig> to  <dig> bp fragments ensured that many of the ga reads occurred at various positions within the 454-flx fragments giving ample flanking sequence on either side of the predicted snp.

this process predicted snps at an 86% success rate when ga reads of both bat  <dig> and jalo eep  <dig> were used to predict the snp. this is similar to the  <dig> % obtained in soybean using two or more reads to predict a snp  <cit>  and 91% obtained in cattle when using two or more reads to predict a snp  <cit>  when sequencing a reduced representation library with ga sequencing aligned to a reference genome. barbazuk et al.,  <cit>  obtained an 85% validation rate when using a  <dig> gs- <dig> run to sequence the transcriptome of two inbred maize lines when there was no reference genome sequence available. the 86% success rate would likely be increased with additional sequencing which could help identify paralogous sequence variants and would help eliminate snps called due to sequencing errors. longer sequencing reads that can now be obtained with the gaiix or the illumina hiseq  <dig> should also allow for better identification of paralogous sequence causing a false positive snp call. even with the longer reads of  <dig> bp available for the gaiix or hiseq  <dig> it is likely that a reference sequence of at least  <dig> bp in the form of a  <dig> sequence would still be needed to obtain enough context sequence surrounding the snp to have a high probability of converting that snp into a usable assay. once the whole genome sequence of common bean is available, a reanalysis of the data should also increase the success rate of snp prediction.

while using both bat  <dig> and jalo eep  <dig> ga sequences gave a high validation rate, requiring a jalo eep  <dig> ga read to validate a snp considerably reduced the final number of predicted snps. however, this step was necessary in order to eliminate paralogous sequence variants. this large decrease in predicted snps also indicated that with the mtrrl constructed here, many more snps could potentially be confirmed with additional jalo eep  <dig> sequencing. even without additional sequence runs we were able to design  <dig> goldengate assays from the sequence data produced from the 454-flx system and obtained working goldengate assays for 79% of the predicted snps. it has been shown in soybean that the conversion of confirmed snps into working goldengate assays is approximately 90%  <cit> . using unconfirmed snps as discovered in this study the percent of working goldengate assays should be the product of the validation rate by the conversion rate of confirmed snps. if the 86% validation rate obtained by sanger sequencing is used than obtaining a 79% rate of working goldengate assays would suggest that for common bean the goldengate assay had a 92% conversion rate for real snps which is slightly higher than what has been obtained with soybean.

all the snp resources developed in the present study have not been exploited in the goldengate assay:  <dig>  snps are still available with predicted success rates equal to the  <dig>  snps used for the goldengate assay development. in addition there are another  <dig> snps with predicted success rates that should be slightly lower than the 79% conversion rate that we obtained that could still be developed into assays. each of the  <dig>  snps has sufficient flanking sequence that a variety of other snp detection methods could be used in place of the goldengate assay  <cit> .

it is expected that the  <dig>  snps should randomly distribute throughout the genome since the enzymes chosen were not chosen to enrich for genic sequence. because of this random distribution, it is expected that when these snps are genetically mapped they will cluster depending upon the amount of heterochromatic dna present in common bean. it has been shown in the closely related legume soybean, that 57% of the genome is heterochromatic dna and that recombination is severely suppressed  <cit> . it has been estimated that in common bean approximately 48% of the genome that is heterochromatic  <cit> . while this predicts that half of the snps discovered will genetically cluster, they will still be useful in assembling the genome sequence of common bean  <cit>  which is currently in progress . it is interesting to note that in soybean,  <dig> % of high-confidence genes are located in the heterochromatic dna  <cit>  and that a snp discovery method using the transcriptome would likely demonstrate some clustering in the heterochromatic dna. this can be observed in the recent snp discovery project in barley which only used cdna for snp discovery and still demonstrates some clustering around the pericentromeric regions on the barley chromosomes which are likely to be heterochromatic  <cit> .

other methods that have used next generation sequencing for snp discovery in organisms without a whole genome sequence reduced the complexity of the genome through the creation of normalized cdna libraries or through capture arrays that were then sequenced using a 454-flx system  <cit> . while these methods can be very successful for snp discovery, they still require the creation of normalized cdna libraries or a capture array which can be expensive and time consuming. another drawback with snp discovery using the transcriptome is that genes are more conserved than non-coding dna which will lead to the discovery of fewer snps  <cit> . the more conserved sequence will also lead to primers or probes hybridizing to both the gene sequence that contains the snp as well as any conserved paralogous sequence, thereby decreasing the success rate of assays for such snp  <cit> . in addition, without a genomic reference sequence, the proportion of successful snp assays designed to cdna sequence will also be decreased due to the present of introns interfering with oligo hybridization.

CONCLUSIONS
coupling two next generation sequencing methods with a multi-tier reduced representation library allowed for high-throughput snp discovery in common bean, an organism for which no whole genome sequence is available and without the need to create normalized cdna libraries. in total, one run of the 454-flx and one run of the ga sequencer were sufficient to discover  <dig>  snps for a total cost under $ <dig> . since this study was initially conducted, the read lengths and number of reads have increased significantly for both the 454-flx and the ga sequencers, thereby allowing a larger number of snps to be discovered for a similar cost. this total cost makes the discovery of snps attainable for many researchers working with organisms for which limited funding is available. the utility of this snp discovery method is also demonstrated by the amount of flanking genomic sequence around the snp which is sufficient to generate assays to covert these snps into usable molecular markers for genetic research.
