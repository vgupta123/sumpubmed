BACKGROUND
infectious salmon anaemia  is a viral disease of marine-farmed atlantic salmon  caused by isa virus , which belongs to the genus isavirus, family orthomyxoviridae  <cit> . in the northern hemisphere, the first registered outbreak of isa was in  <dig> in atlantic salmon "parr", on the southwestern coast of norway  <cit> . subsequently the disease was reported in canada in  <dig>  <cit> , in scotland in  <dig>  <cit> , in faeroe islands in  <dig>  <cit> , and in maine, usa, in  <dig>  <cit> . the clinical disease in farmed atlantic salmon is characterized by variable mortality ranging from  <dig> to 50% with ascites, exophthalmia, petechiation of the visceral adipose tissue, haemorrhagic liver necrosis, renal interstitial haemorrhage and tubular nephrosis, filamental sinus congestion of the gills, splenic congestion with concomitant erythrophagocytosis, and congestion of the lamina propria of the stomach and foregut  <cit> . isav remains an emerging fish pathogen that continues to cause severe economic losses to the salmon-farming industry in an increasing number of countries, although the disease can be successfully eradicated as was managed by scotland in the late 1990s  <cit> . in the southern hemisphere, isav was first detected in chile in  <dig> in marine-farmed coho salmon  and was shown to be of the north american genotype  <cit> . in contrast to the classical presentation of isa in atlantic salmon, the presence of isav in chile up until now has only been associated with a clinical condition called icterus syndrome in coho salmon and virus isolation has not always been possible  <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig>  isav of the north american genotype was found in apparently normal atlantic salmon in lake llanquihue , which is not in the same zone as where the present disease outbreak occurred. it is not known why the north american variant of isav has not caused typical isa outbreaks as those known to occur in eastern canada and maine, usa, and yet the virus has become widespread in the atlantic salmon industry in chile.

isav belongs to the family orthomyxoviridae, together with influenza viruses  <cit> . however, the virus is sufficiently different from influenza viruses to be assigned to its own genus, isavirus. members of this genus are enveloped particles of 90– <dig> nm diameter with surface projections consisting of a combined haemagglutinin-esterase  glycoprotein, which is the receptor binding haemagglutinin with receptor destroying enzyme activity demonstrated to be an acetylesterase  <cit>  encoded on segment  <dig>  <cit> , and a separate fusion  glycoprotein encoded on segment  <dig>  <cit> . the genome consists of eight segments of linear, single-stranded negative sense rna ranging in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb with a total molecular size of approximately  <dig>  kb  <cit> . sequence analysis of several isav isolates on the eight segments consistently reveals two genotypes that are designated with respect to their geographic origin, european and north american, hereafter designated genotypes i and ii, respectively. sequence variation in a 35-amino acid highly polymorphic region  on the he glycoprotein stalk has allowed the separation of isav isolates into different hpr groups, with the hpr <dig> group consisting of the non-cultivable, non-pathogenic viruses detectable only by rt-pcr  <cit>  whereas deletion in the hpr of ≥  <dig> amino acids  lead to increased pathogenicity, and ability to replicate in cell culture with production of cpe and consequent virus isolation  <cit> .

this study reports the diagnostic findings of the first occurrence of isa in the southern hemisphere, and the first characterization the isav isolated from the affected marine-farmed atlantic salmon in chile.

RESULTS
signalment
in mid-june  <dig> following recovery from an outbreak of pisciricketsiosis, a severe increase in mortality was recorded in  <dig> cages on an atlantic salmon grow-out site located in central chiloé in region x of chile  . the moribund fish were lethargic and had dark integument. by the time the fish were removed from the cages  <dig> weeks later, the cumulative mortality had reached 70% in one cage and 82% in the second cage. concomitantly, in other sites of the same area, high mortalities attributed to amoebas and flexibacteriosis were reported, which added to the diagnostic confusion. the total cumulative mortality on the index farm was only  <dig> % at the time of harvest due to company decision to cull all remaining cages independently of their clinical status .

gross pathology
the external gross findings noted on atlantic salmon that were necropsied included exophthalmia, periocular haemorrhage and darkening of the integument. figure 2a summarizes the frequency of the external lesions noted from  <dig> affected fish at necropsy. periocular haemorrhage and paleness of the gills were observed in 38% of the fish, whereas 25% presented with exophthalmia  and jaundice in the ventral zone . the presence of haemorrhages in the central zone was observed in 19% of the fish . of the  <dig> fish that were examined, 63% were also infested with caligus sp. at necropsy, the internal gross findings included haemorrhaging in the visceral adipose tissue, liver, stomach and gut, with the liver and spleen of some fish appearing dark . some fish had hydropericardium , and enlarged spleen and kidney. figure 2c summarizes the frequency of the internal gross lesions noted from  <dig> affected fish which were necropsied in this outbreak. the most common lesions were haemorrhagic enteritis in 64%, haemorrhages in pyloric caeca in 43%, and haemorrhages in visceral adipose tissue in 31% of the cases .

histopathology
diffuse congestion of lamellar capillaries, with marked infiltration of the filamental subcutis by eosinophillic granular leucocytes was evident in gill tissue. the kidney showed mild diffuse sinusoidal congestion with evidence of increase in circulating granulocytes and intravascular erythrophagia. the intestine and pyloric caeca were the most severely affected, showing marked congestion of the lamina propria vasculature with an associated mixed leucocytic infiltration of submucosa and localized perivascular and intra-lumenal haemorrhage . the liver was affected by multifocal to coalescing regions of sinusoidal congestion and peliosis, with mild adjacent hepatocellular necrosis . changes in the spleen included marked sinusoidal congestion and intravascular erythrophagia . mucosal epithelium in the most severely affected regions was denuded. there were no significant morphologic changes noted in the heart, stomach or body wall skeletal muscle. morphologic diagnoses included: a) necrotizing and congestive hepatitis, subacute, multifocal to bridging, moderate to marked; b) ulcerative mixed leucocytic and congestive enteritis, with marked intra-lumenal haemorrhage, subacute, moderate to marked; and d) congestive splenitis and interstitial nephritis, with intravascular erythrophagia, moderate to marked.

virus antigen detection
sections of the kidney, spleen, heart, gills and intestines were subjected to immunohistochemistry staining with anti-isav monoclonal antibody p <dig> . isav proteins were detected in all the organs tested. figure 4a shows positive staining of endothelial cells of the heart. homogenates of pooled spleen and kidney tissues used for virus isolation were also tested in a rapid kit made by aquatic diagnostics, based on immunochromatography with anti-isav monoclonal antibody. the samples taken from affected fish were positive for isav. the infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus  elisa kit and viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus  elisa kit  were used to rule out the presence of ihnv and vhsv in the tissue samples.

virus isolation
homogenates of pooled spleen and kidney tissues inoculated on chinook salmon embryo , salmon head kidney  and epithelioma papulosum cyprini  cell lines produced cpe between  <dig> and  <dig> days post inoculation during primary isolation. the cpe, which was reproduced on subsequent passage on fresh cell line monolayers, was characterized initially by cell vacuolization and rounding and then detachment from the substrate involving the whole cell monolayer. the presence of isav in the cell lysates was confirmed using rt-pcr and an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test  with anti-isav monoclonal antibody p <dig>  including appropriate controls. figure 4b shows positive ifat of a chse- <dig> cell culture inoculated with a tissue sample from affected fish. similar fluorescence was seen with epc cell cultures with cpe . neither cpe nor presence of isav was detected by rt-pcr or ifat in inoculated cultures of bluegill fry  cell line.

rt-pcr
tissue samples shipped in rna later®  to the regional diagnostic virology laboratory, avc, upei, canada, were positive for isav by rt-pcr and negative for both ihnv and vhsv by nested rt-pcr.

sequence analysis
the nucleotide sequences in this report, which are all of isav rna segment  <dig>  are available through genbank , accession nos. eu <dig>  eu <dig>  and eu <dig>  a partial sequence of isav rna segment  <dig> was generated by the norwegian veterinary institute from duplicate samples of the same isa outbreak, and appears in genbank, accession no. am <dig>  tables  <dig>  and  <dig>  show the percent sequence identities between the new chile isav and selected isav isolates from europe and north america. comparison of the rna segment  <dig> sequences of the chilean isav with isav strains of genotype i  showed nucleotide sequence identities ≥  <dig> % whereas with isav strains of genotype ii , it was ≤  <dig> % . comparison of the segment  <dig> sequence of the chilean isav with isav strains of genotype i showed sequence identities ≥  <dig> % whereas with isav strains of genotype ii, it was ≤  <dig> % . thus the new chile isav involved in this outbreak belongs to genotype i .

alignment of the amino acid sequences of rna segment  <dig>  which encodes the f glycoprotein, revealed that the new chile isav has a small insert of  <dig> amino acids  relative to isav strains from europe and north america near the putative proteolytic cleavage site of the precursor f <dig> protein . this insert has 100% sequence identity with rna segment  <dig> of genotype i. isav rna segment  <dig> encodes the pb <dig> polymerase  <cit> . alignment of the amino acid sequences of rna segment  <dig>  which encodes the he glycoprotein, revealed that the new chile isav belongs to hpr7b of the european genotype as described by nylund et al.  <cit>  and plarre et al.  <cit>   and reviewed by rimstad et al.  <cit> .

discussion
the present work constitutes the first report of a case of isa in farmed atlantic salmon in chile. the outbreak was caused by isav of genotype i . the gross and microscopic lesions observed in this outbreak are consistent with the classical isa described in norway  <cit> , canada  <cit> , scotland  <cit> , faeroe islands  <cit>  and united states  <cit> . in particular, the liver congestion and necrosis, as well as the renal, splenic and enteric congestion/haemorrhage in this outbreak are morphologically consistent with lesions pathognomonic for isa. however, where these lesions differed from other presentations of the disease were primarily in the kidney, where in the canadian situation there is profound interstitial haemorrhage, and in the heart, in the chilean isa outbreaks there is hydropericardium and severe myocarditis. previously, such heart lesions have been shown to be prominent only in experimental infections of rainbow trout with isav  <cit> .

the affected fish group in the chilean isa outbreak was recovering from piscirickettsiosis. this particular group had been treated several times against rickettsia at the farm site, and on this occasion the antibiotic treatment which was administered by injection effectively prevented mortality due to piscirickettsiosis. although the pathologic findings in this outbreak were in the range of what is considered as typical isa, it cannot be categorically stated what contribution, if any, the piscirickettsiosis disease contributed to the pathology observed.

the virus responsible for the outbreak caused cpe and was recovered using chse- <dig>  shk- <dig> and epc cell lines, and confirmed as isav by means of rt-pcr and ifa testing. this is the first report of primary isolation of isav using epc cell line, which is a non-salmonid cell line derived from a skin tumour of carp   <cit>  and never before reported to be permissive to isav. most recently, epc cell line was also reported to be permissive to isav of north american genotype  <cit> . moreover rapid sequencing of virus-specific rt-pcr products amplified from the fish tissues identified the virus as belonging to the european genotype. up until now, only some strains of isav of the north american genotype  <cit>  but not the european genotype  <cit>  have been known to replicate and cause cpe in the chse- <dig> cell line, a property that is not associated with the antigenic subtype of isav nor with the hpr group of the he gene  <cit> . thus, the chilean isav has cell line specificities that are different from those of common european genotype isav isolates from europe and north america.

now that we have isav isolates of both genotypes from europe, north america, and south america, we should remove the stigmatizing labeling of isav genotypes by geographic reference. we therefore propose to designate the european genotype as genotype i and the north american genotype as genotype ii. such designation is consistent with our present knowledge, which is not sufficient to explain the anomalous geographic distribution of the two genotypes of isav.

the chilean isav responsible for the isa outbreak is unique in that it has a 33-nucleotide  insert in the middle of rna segment  <dig> which encodes the f glycoprotein. this insert has 100% sequence identity with rna segment  <dig> of isav of genotype i, and probably arose through a non-homologous recombination between the f and pb <dig> genes of the same virus. to date, there have been only  <dig> other isav isolates with inserts in rna segment  <dig>  <cit> . all these isolates are norwegian isav isolates; seven of them were recovered between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  and one was recovered in  <dig>  <cit> . seven of these isolates had inserts from different parts of rna segment  <dig> while in one isolate, the insert was shown to come from rna segment  <dig>  which encodes the isav nucleoprotein. therefore, this chilean isav is the first known isolate to have an insert in rna segment  <dig> coming from rna segment  <dig>  overall, this information indicates that this chilean isav is different from common genotype i isav isolates in europe. the location of the insert in the chilean isav rna segment  <dig> is also unique in that it occurs right in the middle of the 265yp <dig> motif, which was recently shown to be a marker for reduced virulence  <cit> . the rna segment  <dig> of isav belonging to hpr <dig>  a non-pathogenic virus, has 265nq <dig> at this site but without a sequence insertion  <cit> , which would be similar to the chilean isav prior to the non-homologous recombination event between the f and pb <dig> genes. such recombination events are well known in avian influenza virus , involving an insertion in the haemagglutinin  gene of aiv near the cleavage site of the protein and leading to emergence of new virulent strains  <cit> . for example, the avian influenza disease outbreak that occurred in chile in  <dig> was attributed to the non-homologous recombination between the ha and nucleoprotein genes of h7n <dig> aiv  <cit> .

the chilean isav described here clearly differs from the 7833- <dig> isolate  from coho salmon in chile  <cit>  in segment  <dig> and the partial segment  <dig> amino acid sequences. thus the 7833- <dig> virus, which is now wide spread in the atlantic salmon industry in chile, is unlikely to have been the source of this new virus. it is interesting that the alignments on rna segment  <dig> showed the chilean isav to belong to hpr7b that has previously been found in scotland and norway. however, all isav isolates of hpr7b sequenced to date on rna segment  <dig> do not have the 11-amino acid insert found in the chilean isav. comparison of the rna segment  <dig> sequence of this chilean isav with the hpr <dig> virus strain sk779/ <dig>  <cit>  showed a nucleotide sequence identity of  <dig> % and amino acid sequence identity of  <dig> %. in contrast, isav strain 390/ <dig>  which is also of hpr <dig> but from scotland, when compared to the hpr <dig> virus showed a nucleotide sequence identity of  <dig> % and amino acid sequence identity of  <dig> % . this suggests that the chilean isav is distinct from common genotype i isav isolates from europe and north america. the location of the 11-amino acid insert at a motif in the f glycoprotein which is associated with virus virulence, may account for the elusive nature of this chilean virus. it is therefore necessary to sequence the whole genome of this virus and clarify the epidemiology of this isa outbreak so as to establish the origin of this virus, its virulence characteristics and the risk factors associated with its presentation and dissemination, in order to institute adequate strategies for the control and prevention of isa in the chilean salmon industry.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present work constitutes the first report of a case of isa in farmed atlantic salmon in chile. the clinical signs and lesions are consistent with the classical descriptions of the disease in marine-farmed atlantic salmon in the northern hemisphere. the outbreak was caused by isav of genotype i of hpr 7b but distinct from common european isav isolates from europe and north america.
