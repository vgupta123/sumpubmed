BACKGROUND
tamoxifen  treatment is an adjuvant therapy prescribed for estrogen receptor positive breast cancers. tam and its metabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen , n-desmethyltamoxifen  and 4-oh-n-desmethyltamoxifen , exhibit antiestrogenic activities by competitively inhibiting the binding of potent agonists to the estrogen receptor  thus antagonizing their proliferative effects  <cit> . despite the high therapeutic index of tam for breast cancer, there are concerns regarding the increased occurrence of uterine cancer as early as  <dig> years after initiating treatment  <cit> . although there is no direct evidence that it initiates or promotes uterine cancer, tam exhibits partial er-agonist activity by inducing uterotrophy in immature and ovariectomized rodents  <cit> . consequently, a more comprehensive comparison to full agonists is warranted to further elucidate the uterine gene expression effects responsible for its partial agonist activity.

tam is classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator  as a result of its differential effects in breast and uterine tissues  <cit> . a number of factors influence the specificity and efficacy of serm-bound, er-mediated gene expression, and the subsequent physiological effects. this includes differences in tissue-specific er isoform expression levels, ligand-induced er topology, chromatin structure, and coactivator expression and distribution  <cit> , thus making the er an ideal target for drug discovery and development. for example, raloxifene, a second-generation serm, has been approved for osteoporosis and studies also support its use for breast cancer  <cit> .

the uterotrophic assay is a well established method to evaluate the estrogenicity of a compound as measured by er-mediated increases in uterine wet weight making it an ideal model for comparing 17α-ethynylestradiol  and tam elicited effects  <cit> . the uterotrophic response also provides well characterized phenotypic hallmarks that facilitate the interpretation of gene expression changes and their function. early studies have shown that tam elicits a weaker uterotrophic response than 17β-estradiol  in an immature rodent model  <cit> , however, the mechanisms for its partial agonist activity are not well understood.

genome-wide expression analysis, phenotypically anchored to tissue level effects, provides a comprehensive strategy to identify differential gene expression important in the er-induction of uterine wet weight. in this report, we extend previous studies examining er-mediated induction of uterine wet weight  <cit>  by identifying conserved and divergent uterine tissue and gene expression responses elicited by tam when compared to ee, an orally active full agonist that mimics the effects of e <dig>  <cit> . comparative analysis found conserved gene expression responses that exhibited lower efficacy, consistent with the weak agonist activity of tam, as well as divergent responses unique to ee that partially explain the lack of tam-induced water imbibition.

RESULTS
uterine weight
increases in uterine wet weight  in rodents after three daily subcutaneous doses of tam is well documented  <cit> . dose-dependent increases in uterine weight  were observed following three consecutive daily oral treatments of tam , however induction plateaued at 5-fold, compared to 11-fold with an equivalent dose of  <dig> μg/kg 17α-ethynylestradiol   <cit> . comparison of wet and blotted uterine weights indicated no significant water imbibition in tam-treated uteri. however, blotted ee-treated uteri were larger, consistent with past reports that tam induces a less efficacious uterotrophic effect  <cit> . in order to establish a temporal profile, the uterotrophic effects of  <dig> μg/kg tam were also investigated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> hrs. a significant  <dig> -fold increase was observed at  <dig> hrs after a single  <dig> μg/kg tam dose  which was delayed compared to the significant increase seen with  <dig> μg/kg ee at  <dig> hrs  <cit> .

morphometric analysis and histopathology
luminal epithelial cell height , luminal circumference and number of endometrial glands are hallmarks of estrogen action in the rodent which correlate with uww induction  <cit> . significant dose-dependent increases in lech and luminal circumference were initially detected at  <dig> μg/kg tam . interestingly, lech was not significantly different between  <dig> μg/kg ee and tam, although the luminal circumference of ee uteri was greater with more pronounced invagination of the luminal glandular epithelium . there was also mild to moderate hypertrophy in the stromal nuclei at  <dig> μg/kg tam with moderate epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia at  <dig> μg/kg tam, which was marked at higher doses. mild edema was noted for all samples beginning at  <dig> μg/kg tam. marked to severe stromal nuclei hypertrophy and epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia, all with mild edema, was observed at  <dig> μg/kg ee. mild to moderate stromal edema was observed as early as  <dig> hrs following after a single  <dig> μg/kg tam dose, while increased uww and lech were not significant until  <dig> hrs . no significant increase in luminal circumference was observed in the first  <dig> hrs after treatment.

* statistically different from time matched vehicle 

a lumen larger than 100× field of view, accurate measurements could not be made at 40× magnification time course vehicle samples are not significantly different from each other.

uterine endometrial glands synthesize and secrete fluids in preparation for conceptus, implantation and growth. significant increases in the number of glands was observed at  <dig> μg/kg tam  in the absence of a dose responsive increase, which may be an artifact of histological sampling of the uterine horn. similarly, ee-treated uteri exhibited an increased number of endometrial glands that was not statistically significant.

uterine gene expression changes elicited by tamoxifen
differentially expressed genes in the dose and time dependent studies were identified based on their empirical bayes posterior probability of activity  on a per-gene, per-time point basis. p1-values approaching  <dig>  indicate a greater likelihood of treatment-related differential gene expression. using p <dig> >  <dig>  and |fold change| ≥  <dig>  as selection criteria, a prioritized list of  <dig> features, representing  <dig> unique entrez gene annotated genes, were identified in the temporal study with 55% of the genes exhibiting induction and 45% repression . differential expression levels ranged from  <dig> -fold repression  to  <dig> -fold induction , further demonstrating the responsiveness of the uterus to tamoxifen. using the same selection criteria  >  <dig>  and |fold change| of ≥  <dig> ) at a minimum of three doses, to ensure dose responsiveness,  <dig> features, representing  <dig> unique entrez gene-annotated genes, exhibited dose dependent expression . of the  <dig> genes exhibiting a dose-dependent response at  <dig> ×  <dig> hrs and of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes at  <dig> ×  <dig> hrs in the time course study,  <dig> genes  were in common, demonstrating good reproducibility between experiments.

differentially expressed genes were associated with cell growth and proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, extracellular matrix modification, nucleotide synthesis, dna replication, protein synthesis and turnover, lipid metabolism, glycolysis and immunological responses. the temporal changes in gene expression were best represented using five k-means clusters: a) induced at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, b) induced and sustained from  <dig> –  <dig> hrs, c) induced late at  <dig> hrs, d) repressed between  <dig> –  <dig> hrs and e) repressed and sustained from  <dig> –  <dig> hrs . the majority of tam-elicited differential expression occurred after  <dig> hrs with only  <dig> features  exhibiting differential gene expression between  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, in marked contrast to ee studies where significant gene expression changes occurred prior to  <dig> hrs  <cit> . the temporal pattern of differential gene expression correlates with the histology results which indicate a delayed response in comparison to ee.

eleven genes, representative of affected pathways and exhibiting different temporal gene expression patterns , signal transduction , immunological responses , acid-base homeostasis  and lipid transport ), were verified by qrt-pcr and exhibited good agreement with microarray results. correlation coefficients ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   .

immunohistochemistry  was also used to assess and localize pcna protein expression following tam treatment . microarray results indicate a  <dig> -fold increase in pcna transcript levels between  <dig> –  <dig> hrs after treatment with ihc confirming elevated protein expression in epithelial and stromal cells in  <dig> hr tam treated samples when compared to time matched controls.

comparison of common temporal tam and ee gene expression data
temporal tam data were compared to an analogous ee study using the same immature, ovariectomized c57bl/ <dig> mouse model  <cit> . employing the p <dig> >  <dig>  and |fold change| ≥  <dig>  criteria,  <dig> unique annotated genes were differentially expressed following treatment with  <dig> μg/kg ee, of which  <dig> were also activated by tam . agglomerative hierarchical clustering of common genes by treatment and time indicates that the  <dig> hr tam response is most similar to the  <dig> hr ee response, followed closely by  <dig> hr tam . interestingly, tam and ee exhibit similar gene expression profiles at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs, suggesting that the delay in some tam-elicited responses is not maintained at later time points.

expression profiles were compared for the  <dig> differentially expressed genes that were regulated by tam and ee. these genes were categorized as similar, more efficacious by ee or tam, or ambiguous . a total of  <dig> genes  exhibited expression profiles that were similar in pattern and efficacy when a temporal shift, due to delayed tam response, was considered. interestingly,  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed at least 2-fold more by ee when compared to tam  were associated with cell growth, regulation of transcription and protein metabolism and transport including fos  and inhbb . these genes are involved in cell cycle regulation and cellular growth, respectively, and possibly support the greater physiological effect exhibited by ee. in contrast,  <dig> genes were modulated 2-fold or greater by tam, including sfn , which is associated with proliferation inhibition. in general, efficacious tam elicited responses were associated with receptor-mediated signal transduction, ion transport and protein metabolism.

gene expression comparisons between the two studies were also verified by qrt-pcr. as previously reported, gene expression data is subject to compression  <cit> , and therefore the sensitivity of qrt-pcr data is often greater when compared to microarray data. thus, some genes classified as similar may also be classified as ee- or tam-efficacious. for example, microarray data suggested that cdkn1a response to tam and ee were comparable, but through qrt-pcr ee induced an 8-fold response compared to a  <dig> -fold induction by tam .

tam and ee responsive genes were also examined for estrogen response elements  in their promoter regions by comparison to a list of computationally identified sequences  <cit> . eres were found in  <dig> tam-active genes and  <dig> ee-active genes, with  <dig> regulated by both compounds. only 10% of tam or ee differentially expressed genes possessed an ere suggesting that other trans-acting factors may also be involved or that eres were outside of the search regions. annotation information in public repositories is constantly evolving, thus gene names may have changed or new genes may have been added since the publication. as a result, some genes may be misclassified regarding their ere status.

tam- and ee-specific gene expression data
gene expression changes unique to either tam or ee may be another factor contributing to their different uterotrophic responses. an additional filtering method was used to identify genes more likely to be unique to ee treatment which involved excluding an extended list of tam-regulated genes obtained by relaxing the tam criteria to p <dig> >  <dig>  and |fold change| ≥  <dig>  from the standard criteria  >  <dig> ; |fold change| ≥  <dig> ) of ee . the same approach was also used to obtain a list of genes unique to tam . this ensures that those genes significant in both treatments and approaching significance in the other treatment are not considered as unique, thus increasing the likelihood of identifying treatment-specific differential gene expression responses. for example, to identify unique ee responses, the  <dig> differentially expressed tam genes that satisfy the p <dig> >  <dig>  and |fold change| >  <dig>  were excluded from the  <dig> differentially expressed ee genes  >  <dig> ; |fold change| ≥  <dig> ) to identify  <dig> genes unique to ee treatment . similarly, genes more likely unique to tam were identified by excluding the  <dig> differentially expressed ee genes with a p <dig> >  <dig>  and |fold change| >  <dig>  that were in common with the  <dig> differentially expressed tam genes  >  <dig> ; |fold change| =  <dig> ) to identify  <dig> genes more likely unique to tam . treatment-specific responses exhibited profiles distinctly different in pattern and magnitude from their counterpart  even when taking delays, due to tam, into consideration.

the pathways represented within unique ee-responsive genes include apoptosis regulators  and water imbibition , consistent with the physiological effects observed. fewer unique tam-responsive genes were identified. there was not an overrepresentation of any functional pathway consistent with its weaker uterotrophic response. these data suggest that differentially regulate subsets of genes exist that contribute to the distinctive uterotrophic response elicited by each treatment.

discussion
a comparative approach was used that integrates the gross organ, histopathological, and morphometric uterine effects of ee and tam with their dose response and temporal gene expression profiles to further elucidate the molecular basis of the partial agonist activity of tam. tam treatment induces a 5-fold increase in gross uterine weight following three daily doses compared to an 11-fold increase with ee. in addition, no significant water imbibition was induced by tam. these effects are well documented and are the basis for the classification of tam as a partial agonist  <cit> . moreover, tam induces a delayed increase in uterine weight when compared to ee which may be partially attributed to its weaker agonist activity but is more likely a reflection of slower absorption  <cit> . in contrast, peak serum levels of ee are detected within two hours of treatment  <cit> .

at equi-efficacious doses of tam and ee , comparable effects on uww, luminal circumference and glandular epithelial were observed , suggesting both treatments proceed through similar changes to achieve uterotrophy. however, at higher doses, tam does not elicit a comparable gamut of responses as seen with higher doses of ee. surprisingly, tam increased luminal epithelial thickness  <cit> , due to cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, that was not significantly different from ee, but mediated a smaller increase in luminal circumference with more endometrial glands compared to ee. although these results appear contradictory, glandular epithelium may arise from the luminal epithelium and appear as highly invaginated regions of the lumen that generate a large secretory surface area  <cit> . thus, despite fewer endometrial glands in ee samples, its glandular area is greater due to the increased luminal glandular surface area which was not observed in the tam treated samples.

temporal tamoxifen-elicited gene expression profiles were examined following a single dose as well as after three daily doses of  <dig> μg/kg tam. only  <dig> features, representing  <dig> annotated genes, exhibited differential expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs after tam treatment compared to  <dig> ee genes at the same time points  <cit> , consistent with the delayed histological effects. of these early tam responses, only esr <dig> and car <dig> have been reported to be induced by estrogen  <cit> . at  <dig> hrs,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in response to tam, of which  <dig> genes were also affected by ee between  <dig> and  <dig> hrs  <cit> . agglomerative hierarchical clustering suggests that genes affected by tam and ee exhibited comparable gene expression changes despite the delay in tam responses.

genes regulated by tam and ee represent a variety of pathways including cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal re-organization, nucleotide metabolism, immune and complement activation and lipid transport and metabolism, and have previously been associated with eliciting the uterotrophic response  <cit> . similarities in their gene expression profiles suggest that the uterotrophic response involves a defined subset of genes mediated by the er. furthermore, greater than 75% of tam-activated genes that possessed an ere, were also activated by ee. however, differences in efficacy and responsive genes may partially explain uterotrophic response differences.

despite temporal delays, many genes were regulated by both ee and tam. most of these commonly active genes exhibited comparable fold changes suggesting that they do not significantly influence the magnitude of the uterotrophic response. for instance, both treatments equally repressed uterotrophic supportive pro-apoptotic caspases  . although these genes were responsive to ee and tam, others demonstrated quantitative differences in their expression behavior. twenty-eight genes, including the proliferation supportive genes cdkn1a, fos and inhbb, exhibited greater ee efficacy consistent with their previously reported estrogen-induced expression  <cit>  resulting in a full uterotrophic agonist response. in contrast,  <dig> genes more highly induced by tam included g2/m inhibitor , which has been associated with human endometrial carcinomas  <cit>  to reduce proliferation. many of these quantitative differences in gene expression efficacy are consistent with the potent agonist activity of ee and the weak agonist activity of tam.

there were also treatment-specific gene expression effects. tentatively,  <dig> and  <dig> modulated genes were identified as unique to ee or tam, respectively. in general, these responses were consistent with uterotrophic activity elicited by ee and tam. for example, qrt-pcr verified the early induction of mitotic gene, anapc <dig> by ee . also, the treatment specific repression of pro-apoptotic bcl- <dig> member, bok, and the induction of pdcd <dig>  an apoptosis regulator, associated with proliferating tissues  <cit>  are consistent with the greater efficacy of ee. bok has previously been shown to be ee responsive in uteri, whereas pdcd <dig> approached the statistical cut-off in a previous study  <cit> . for tam, qrt-pcr confirmed decreased expression of sipa <dig> , a repressed response at  <dig> hrs associated with decreased proliferation  <cit>  that may reduce hyperplasia.

dna synthesis and replication pathways were also differentially regulated. sustained up-regulation of dndp phosphorylating genes, nme <dig> and nme <dig>  <cit> , suggest salvage pathways are emphasized for nucleotide synthesis rather than de novo processes where prps <dig>  the first step in purine biosynthesis, is repressed during the same period. these genes are similarly modulated by tam and ee suggesting that proliferation may deplete resources for de novo synthesis. only nme <dig> has been previously shown to be ee responsive in rodent uteri  <cit> . however, ee uniquely inhibited the de novo pyrimidine synthesis gene, dhodh , and induced the nucleotide recycling gene, nt5m   <cit>  suggesting an involvement of salvage pathways to support ee-induced proliferation which have not previously been reported to be estrogen responsive.

water imbibition is a characteristic uterine response to estrogens involving the increased flow of water to the lumen mediated by aquaporins and ion transporters  <cit> . it does not appear to be a factor in tam-induced uterine weight increases as blotted weights were not significantly different from wet weights. aqp <dig> and aqp <dig> are comparably regulated by tam and ee, while aqp <dig> induction was specific to ee . aqp <dig> is a known contributor to water imbibition  <cit>  and its ee-specific response suggests it may play a larger role in the process of a full uterotrophic response.

the lack of ion transporter regulation may also be a contributing factor in the absence of tam-induced water imbibition. the ee induction of zinc transporter, slc30a <dig> , which causes ion uptake into various vesicle compartments  <cit>  may facilitate stromal edema and has been shown to be responsive to estrogen where it is down-regulated in brain tissue  <cit> . organic anion transporter, slc22a <dig>  was repressed by ee from  <dig> –  <dig> hrs in the uteri suggesting anion retention in the stroma that may also be important for edema. slc22a <dig> is an importer in the basolateral membrane of kidney tubule epithelia , and is estrogen responsive in the kidney  <cit> .

differential regulation of atp production genes is also consistent with the greater uterotrophic efficacy of ee. transcripts associated with oxidative phosphorylation  complex i, ndufb <dig> , and complex iii, uqcr  and uqcrh , were all up-regulated. although not previously been reported as responsive, collectively, the ee modulation of oxphos components is consistent with greater energy demands required to support increasing hypertrophic and hyperplastic activity induced by ee compared to tam.

other tam gene expression studies have been conducted using in vitro breast cancer models, primarily mcf- <dig> cells. comparisons of differentially expressed gene lists identified minimal to no overlap of tam responses between in vitro human breast tissue and in vivo mouse uterus  <cit> . only the induction of uqcrb  <cit> , nqo <dig>  <cit> , tff <dig>  mapt  <cit> , pctk <dig>  wnt <dig>  <cit> , myb, cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  mcm <dig>  fos and mybl <dig>  <cit>  and repression of xrcc <dig>  tgfa  <cit> , rap1ga <dig>  blnk, tm4sf <dig>  matn <dig>  ifi <dig>  tgfb <dig> and smpd <dig>  <cit>  correlated with the changes observed in the current study. moreover, there are examples of divergent gene expression changes such as inverse responses for pfn <dig>  <cit> , ctsh, selenbp <dig>  nfrkb, cyp1a <dig>  <cit> , prps <dig> and tmsb4x  <cit> . the long term uterine effects of tam have also been examined in mice following neonatal exposure. mice were treated for four consecutive days after treatment and uteri samples examined at various months after dosing  <cit> . col1a <dig> exhibited persistent up-regulation months after treatment and was also induced in our short term study. several factors, in addition to model differences, likely contribute to the minimal overlap including differences in array platforms and genome coverage, study design, and data analysis. for example, e <dig> and 4oh-tam were utilized in the in vitro studies while ee and tam were administered to the mice.

despite the minimal overlap between the models, the activities of tam, when compared to e <dig> were comparable. in vitro and in vivo, the gene expression changes elicited by 4oh-tam were similar to those mediated by e <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells. furthermore, the magnitude of gene expression changes due to 4oh-tam was attenuated compared to e <dig>  <cit> . although 4oh-tam and ee induced similar cell cycle genes, other down-stream mechanisms were also regulated to prevent 4oh-tam mediated cell cycle progression  <cit> . some of these mechanisms may play a roll in the partial uterotrophic response elicited by tam in treated mice.

differences in chemical structure may also contribute to ligand specific responses. tam belongs to the stilbene/triphenylethylene family while ee is steroidal. each has unique binding modes resulting in different er conformations  <cit> , binding affinities  <cit> , ligand-induced binding domain topographies  <cit> , coactivator recruitment capabilities  <cit> , gene-specific thresholds of activation, and efficacies  <cit> . specifically, 4oh-tam induces a different conformational change in the er compared to e <dig>  influencing interactions with different coactivators. electrophoretic mobility shift assay and crystallographic examination  <cit>  have shown that 4oh-tam-bound er could not bind a grip <dig> coactivator lxxll peptide due to helix- <dig> interference at the binding cleft, which was recruited by e <dig>  consequently coactivator recruitment may influence receptor complex interactions with response element variants  <cit>  which has been shown with other structurally diverse ligands and nuclear receptors  <cit> .

in addition, differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion  between ligands and species, likely contribute to divergent physiological and gene expression characteristics. it is well documented that tam metabolism differs significantly between humans and rodents, for example, tam n-oxide, 4oh-tam and dmt are the predominant metabolites in the mouse, while dmt is the major human metabolite in microsomal studies  <cit> . in rodents, the levels and rates of tam metabolism to 4oh-tam and dmt were significantly different in the rat and mouse, where the rat metabolite profile more closely resembles human profiles  <cit> .

a cytochrome p <dig> 2d <dig> polymorphism in humans further illustrates the potential effects of differences in metabolism on tam activity. 4-oh-n-desmethyltamoxifen  is a recently identified tam metabolite, found at higher levels than 4oh-tam in patient serum, generated by cyp2d <dig> activity. it exhibits similar er binding affinity, and comparable breast cancer cell proliferation and estrogen-induced ps <dig> mrna expression inhibition activities compared to 4oh-tam  <cit> . however, patients expressing specific cyp2d <dig> polymorphisms  that impaired or abolished cyp2d <dig> metabolism have a nearly 2-fold higher risk of breast cancer recurrence  <cit> . collectively, these studies illustrate the significant differences in tam metabolism between models that compromise the extrapolation of rodent data for use in human risk assessment.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the comprehensive time course and dose response studies, a complete assessment of the gene expression effects and their roles in uterine responses could not be achieved due to limited genome coverage on our custom cdna arrays and incomplete functional annotation for the represented genes. however, comparative tam and ee studies using comparable designs and models identified conserved functionally annotated gene expression changes that are consistent with the measured uterotrophic response. qualitatively, tam and ee gene expression profiles are similar; however, there are quantitative differences in efficacy, consistent with the partial agonist activity of tam. despite the evidence for these qualitative and quantitative differences in gene expression, demonstration that these changes have causal roles in the partial uterotrophic response elicited by tam is required. the relevance of the differences between estrogen and tam and the association with endometrial cancer  <cit>  also needs further investigation.
