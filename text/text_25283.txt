BACKGROUND
familial cases of the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  comprise about 10 % of all cases. approximately two-thirds thereof can be explained by mutations in known als genes, with c9orf <dig>  sod <dig>  tardbp and fus being the most frequent  <cit> . recently, mutations in several other genes, e.g. pfn <dig>  <cit>  or hnrnpa <dig>  <cit> , have been shown to be a rare cause of als. analysis of these rare causal mutations is a valuable tool for the uncovering of altered pathways possibly common to als pathogenesis.

the discovery that pfn <dig> mutations cause als  <cit>  implicates disturbed dynamics of the cytoskeleton in degeneration of motor neurons and are in accordance with previous reports associating mutations in nefh  <cit> , prph  <cit>  or dctn <dig>  <cit>  with als. pfn <dig> regulates dynamics of actin polymerization but also binds to a great variety of proteins serving as a platform involved in controlling multiple other cellular processes like membrane trafficking or even splicing events in the nucleus  <cit> . recently, pfn <dig> was implicated in the formation and clearance of stress granules and seems to harbor an intrinsic ability to induce stress granule formation upon overexpression  <cit> . stress granules are transient cellular structures impeding translation upon different stressors and are composed of rna-binding proteins, mrnas as well as factors involved in translation repression. chronic cellular stress and a pathogenic transition of transient stress granules to permanent aggregates of rna-binding proteins are thought to be important in als  <cit> .

so far, eight missense mutations in pfn <dig> have been associated with als, namely c71g, m114t, e117g, g118v  <cit> , t109m  <cit> , r136w  <cit> , a20t and q139l  <cit> . it has been shown that pfn <dig> proteins carrying the c71g, m114t or g118v substitutions are impaired in actin binding while the pfn <dig> e117g variant retains its ability binding to actin  <cit> . this finding parallels genetic evidences supporting monogenic pathogenicity of pfn <dig> c71g, m114t and g118v while assigning the pfn <dig> e117g variant the role of a risk factor for als  <cit> . so far, no biochemical data exists about the actin binding properties of pfn <dig> t109m, r136w, a20t and q139l. while the pfn <dig> r136w, q139l and a20t mutations were detected in single individuals with sporadic or familial als, respectively  <cit> , pathogenicity of the pfn <dig> t109m mutation is supported by co-segregation with the disease in the affected family  <cit>  as well as serum microrna profiles of pre-clinical mutation carriers that are highly similar to profiles of pre-clinical carriers of als associated mutations in c9orf <dig> or sod <dig>  <cit> .

in order to further elucidate the relevance of altered actin binding for als-associated pfn <dig> mutant proteins, we studied in detail the actin binding properties of the pfn <dig> t109m variant as well as its impact on the actin cytoskeleton.

RESULTS
unaltered expression and splicing of pfn <dig> t109m
the pfn <dig> c.326c>t mutation causing the t109m substitution is located directly at an exon/intron boundary   <cit> . although not predicted by splice site prediction software , we wanted to rule out the possibility that pathogenicity of the pfn <dig> t109m mutation is due to a haploinsufficiency caused by impaired splicing of the mrna. we therefore measured relative pfn <dig> mrna abundance and pfn <dig> protein levels in lcls of five healthy controls as well as in pfn <dig> t109m mutant lcls of two clinically definite als patients and three pre-clinical mutation carriers . no significant difference of pfn <dig> mrna or pfn <dig> protein levels could be detected between the different groups.fig.  <dig> pfn <dig> protein or mrna levels are not affected by the pfn <dig> t109m mutation. a measurement of relative pfn <dig> mrna abundance by qrt-pcr of lcls of five healthy controls and pfn <dig> t109m mutant lcls of two als patients and three pre-clinical mutation carriers. results were normalized to u <dig> snrna using 2−ΔΔct-method . b western blot comparing amounts of pfn <dig> protein of lcls of five healthy controls, two pfn <dig> t109m mutant als patients and three pre-clinical carriers of the pfn <dig> t109m mutation. same amounts of protein were pooled in the respective group. actin is shown as a loading control



pfn <dig> t109m is not impaired in ß-actin binding
the pfn <dig> t109m substitution is located in close spatial proximity to c71g, m114t, e117g and g118v near the actin binding surface of pfn <dig>  <cit> . since pfn <dig> substitutions c71g, m114t and g118v but not e117g impair actin binding  <cit>  we examined the actin binding properties of the pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein. additionally, the t <dig> of pfn <dig> is a phosphorylation site occupied in vivo  <cit>  and altered actin binding by disrupted phosphorylation of t <dig> was suggested before to possibly contribute to toxicity of this mutation  <cit> . we therefore performed a co-immunoprecipitation using a v5-antibody in lysates of hek <dig> cells overexpressing v5-pfn <dig> wildtype or different v5-pfn <dig> mutant proteins including a phospho-deficient  and a phospho-mimicking  mutant. western blot detection of co-precipitated actin revealed no deficits in the binding properties of pfn <dig> t109m . in contrast to the expected opposing effects of the pfn <dig> t109a and t109d mutant proteins on actin binding we found for both an increased affinity to actin. hence, we omitted these artificial phospho-mimicking and phospho-deficient proteins in further experiments.fig.  <dig> pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein is not impaired in actin binding. a co-immunoprecipitation of lysates of hek <dig> cells overexpressing wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig> using a v5-antibody followed by western blot detection of v5-pfn <dig> and actin. b purified recombinant his6-tagged wildtype and mutant pfn <dig>  used for the pulldown assay was subjected to sds-page followed by staining with coomassie brilliant blue. c his6-tag pulldown using recombinant his6-pfn <dig> and lysates of hek <dig> cells. his6-tagged pfn <dig> and binding proteins were precipitated with ni–nta agarose  and subjected to western blotting. d quantification of the interaction of actin with wildtype and mutant pfn <dig> using a split luciferase assay. luciferase activity from protein complementation was measured in hek <dig> cells 24 h after transfection with plasmids coding for pfn1-hgluc and actin-hgluc. signals were normalized to the expression of both fusion proteins determined by western blotting and are shown relative to the signal of wildtype pfn1-hgluc and actin-hgluc 



to validate the unchanged actin binding properties of pfn <dig> t109m we performed a pulldown assay using recombinant his6-pfn <dig>  and quantified the pfn1-actin interaction in living cells using a split luciferase complementation assay . both approaches confirmed the unchanged actin binding properties of pfn <dig> t109m, while the previously reported reduction in actin binding of pfn <dig> c71g and g118v  <cit>  were reproduced.

the actin cytoskeleton of hek <dig> cells is not affected by pfn <dig> t109m
besides binding of actin monomers, another important function of pfn <dig> affecting the polymerization of actin is the exchange of actin bound adp to atp . hence, the unaltered actin binding properties of the pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein described above do not exclude an impact of this mutation on nucleotide exchange and actin polymerization. to address this issue, we stained filamentous actin  in hek <dig> cells overexpressing wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig> using phalloidin . we could not identify any marked differences in cell morphology and quantity or distribution of f-actin between wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig> expressing cells. interestingly, even the pfn <dig> mutants c71g  and g118v, which are clearly impaired in actin binding, still co-localize with the dense f-actin structures near the plasma membrane .fig.  <dig> unaltered actin cytoskeleton in hek <dig> cells overexpressing wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig>  hek <dig> cells transfected with plasmids coding for wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig> were stained for exogeneous pfn <dig>  and endogeneous f-actin . note the formation of aggregates of the v5-pfn <dig> c71g protein in roughly 50 % of cells reported previously  <cit> . scale bar is 10 µm



to further verify the observations of immunocytochemistry, we determined the ratio of filamentous and globular actin  in hek <dig> cells overexpressing wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig> . also in this experiment no difference was detected between cells expressing v5-pfn <dig> wildtype and c71g  or t109m mutant protein . solely v5-pfn <dig> g118v slightly  increased the f/g-actin ratio compared to wildtype pfn <dig> fig.  <dig> the t109m mutation of pfn <dig> does not change the f/g-actin ratio in hek <dig> cells. upper panel f/g-actin ratios of hek <dig> cells overexpressing wildtype and mutant v5-pfn <dig>  f- and g-actin fractions of the respective cell lysates were separated by ultracentrifugation and actin levels analyzed by western blotting and densitometry . lower panel representative western blot of f- and g-actin fractions used for densitometric analysis



discussion
in this study, we show that als-associated pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein is not impaired in actin binding and does not affect the actin cytoskeleton using several different approaches. furthermore, we exclude that pathogenicity of this mutation located directly at an exon/intron boundary is due to a splicing defect. taken together, our results provide evidence for additional or alternative mechanisms beyond impairment of the actin cytoskeleton responsible for motor neuron degeneration associated with pfn1-linked als.

the finding that als-associated mutations in pfn <dig> are deficient in actin binding suggests disturbed actin dynamics to cause motor neuron degeneration  <cit> . however, our results show unchanged actin binding of the causal pfn <dig> t109m variant. therefore, exclusion of haploinsufficiency by a splicing defect as the pathogenic mechanism of the pfn <dig> t109m mutation, which is located close to an exon/intron boundary  <cit> , is an important approach. we were not able to examine cns tissue affected in als and thus cannot exclude splicing defects in neurons. however, unchanged pfn <dig> mrna and protein levels in lcls of als patients and pre-clinical carriers of the pfn <dig> t109m mutation argue against haploinsufficiency as the pathogenic mechanism.

phosphorylation of t <dig> of pfn <dig> was proposed to fine-tune actin binding and loss of this phosphorylation site by the t109m substitution might result in disturbed actin dynamics  <cit> . increased actin binding of the phospho-mimicking pfn <dig> t109d mutant protein reported here would be in line with this hypothesis. however, since actin binding of the phospho-deficient pfn <dig> t109a was increased as well and did not show the opposite effect of the phospho-mimicking t109d mutation, we conclude that both artificial mutants are not suitable to examine the influence of phosphorylation on actin binding. possibly both mutations induce structural changes in pfn <dig> increasing its affinity to actin. nevertheless, the finding that the phosphorylation-deficient pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein exhibits no differences in actin binding compared to wildtype pfn <dig>  strongly argues for an independence of actin binding from the phosphorylation of t <dig> in pfn <dig> 

further evidence recently provided in yeast supports activity of pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein in actin dynamics. pfn <dig> t109m and e117g but not c71g, m114t and g118v were able to rescue the growth of yeast strains depleted in pfy <dig>  the yeast homolog of pfn <dig>  <cit> . hence, the ability to substitute for pfy <dig> seems to parallel actin binding capability of pfn <dig>  in the same study, a genetic screen in yeast identified stress granule formation to be closely connected to pfn <dig> and the recruitment to and clearance from stress granules of pfn <dig> and als-associated mutant pfn <dig> proteins as well as their impact on stress granule formation was studied in detail using various assays. interestingly, regarding the intrinsic ability of pfn <dig> to induce stress granules upon overexpression or the clearance of stress granules from cells after heat shock, the pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein paralleled the characteristics of pfn <dig> c71g, m114t and g118v more closely than of pfn <dig> e117g  <cit> . hence, recruitment to and clearance from stress granules of pfn <dig> variants seems to be more closely connected to pathogenicity than the ability to bind actin. the only exception is the recruitment of mutant pfn <dig> to arsenite-induced stress granules. here, a similar recruitment of pfn <dig> t109m and e117g as well as a decreased recruitment of c71g, m114t and g118v indicate an actin dependent mechanism. further studies are thus warranted to evaluate a possible involvement of stress granules in pfn1-linked neurodegeneration in more details.

additional to unchanged actin binding, we show that pfn <dig> t109m has no apparent effect on the actin cytoskeleton and does not alter the f/g-actin ratio in hek <dig> cells. we therefore assume that pfn <dig> t109m is fully functional concerning its interactions with actin, i.e. binding and catalysis of nucleotide exchange. however, our study does not exclude defects of actin dynamics caused by pfn <dig> t109m, e.g. the rate of reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to stimuli. interestingly, overexpression of pfn <dig> c71g and g118v also had no apparent effect on the actin cytoskeleton and only pfn <dig> g118v significantly increased the f/g-actin ratio in hek <dig> cells. these observations are in line with recent results of boopathy and colleagues  <cit>  showing that recombinant pfn <dig> c71g, m114t and e117g similarly to wildtype pfn <dig> reduce the elongation rate of actin filaments in an in vitro polymerization assay. solely pfn <dig> g118v showed a trend towards impairment of this function. hence, only pfn <dig> g118v seems to have an impact on actin polymerization that is different from the wildtype protein.

taken together, increasing evidence indicates the involvement of other/additional mechanisms in pfn1-linked als than impairments of the actin cytoskeleton. for example, mutation-induced destabilization of pfn <dig> has been suggested  <cit> . taking into account the multi-functionality of pfn <dig>  <cit> , several additional mechanisms are possible. for example, pfn <dig> interacts directly with smn, a key-player in spinal muscular atrophy , and both co-localize in nuclear gems  <cit> . nuclear gems are sub-nuclear structures involved in mrna splicing events and depletion of nuclear gems has been repeatedly reported in als . mutant pfn <dig> could thus influence the regulation of such protein/rna granules. further studies and analysis of additional als-associated pfn <dig> mutant proteins are urgently needed to better understand the mechanisms ultimately resulting in the death of motor neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides strong evidence that binding of the als-associated pfn <dig> t109m mutant protein to actin is not impaired and that this mutation has no effect on the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting additional or alternative mechanisms for pfn1-linked neurodegeneration beyond an impairment of cytoskeletal dynamics.
