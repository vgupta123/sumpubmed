BACKGROUND
the tropical tree theobroma cacao l. is cultivated as a cash crop in many developing countries and provides the main ingredients for chocolate production. in  <dig>  the global market value of the chocolate industry surpassed $ <dig> billion and the demand for cacao beans  continues to increase  <cit> . cacao trees are generally highly heterozygous and when propagated by seed, only a small fraction of individuals are high producing  <cit> . thus, vegetative propagation systems provide a means to avoid the issue of trait variation, through cloning of the top elite individual genotypes.

several methods of vegetative propagation are commonly used with cocoa . in addition, in vitro somatic embryogenesis  tissue culture offers an approach to speed up the development and deployment of genetically improved genotypes because of its potentially very high multiplication rate and scalability. protocols for primary and secondary se in cacao have been well documented  <cit> . however, se can be limited by embryogenic efficiency, which varies significantly between genotypes. a deeper understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in regulating the se process in cacao could potentially lead to improvement of se methods for commercial plant production. to characterize the mechanisms regulating embryogenesis, we have chosen a translational biology approach, leveraging the knowledge gained from the model plant arabidopsis.

in arabidopsis, leafy cotyledon  transcription factors, including atlec <dig>  <cit> , atlec <dig>  <cit>  and atfus <dig>  <cit>  have been characterized as master regulators of zygotic embryo development  <cit> . the atlec <dig> gene encodes a b <dig> domain transcription factor, which binds specifically to the ry motifs in the 5′ flanking regions of atlec2-induced genes  <cit> . atlec <dig> is exclusively expressed in developing zygotic embryos during both the early development and maturation phases. it is required for development and maintenance of suspensors and cotyledons and for the acquisition of desiccation tolerance and inhibition of premature germination  <cit> . loss-of-function arabidopsis lec <dig> mutants exhibit pleiotropic effects including abnormal suspensor anatomy, abnormal cotyledons with trichomes, precociously activated shoot apical meristems, highly pigmented cotyledon tips with prominent anthocyanin accumulation and reduced accumulation of seed storage compounds  <cit> . atlec <dig> functions both by inducing a cascade effect of other transcription factors controlling various developmental and metabolic pathways as well as through direct targeting and regulation of seed storage genes  <cit> . for example, atwri <dig>  another key transcription factor crucial to embryo development, is a direct target of atlec <dig> and is necessary to regulate normal fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> .

lec genes are also important during somatic embryogenesis. for example, lec <dig> mutants produced ses in arabidopsis at a very low efficiency  <cit> , while ectopic expression of atlec <dig> in arabidopsis and tobacco vegetative tissue induced se formations  <cit> . in addition, the capacity for se was abolished in double  or triple  lec mutants, which further confirms the critical and redundant roles of lec proteins during se  <cit> . it is well known that exogenous application of hormones, such as synthetic auxin  and cytokinin, are required to induce se  <cit>  and furthermore, a functional interaction between auxin and atlec <dig> has been observed. in arabidopsis, the expression of atlec <dig> was significantly up-regulated in response to exogenously applied  <dig> -d during the induction phase of se  <cit> . also, expression levels of atlec <dig> were observed to be significantly higher in embryogenic callus compared to the non-embryogenic callus of the same age  <cit> . interestingly, overexpression of atlec <dig> in immature zygotic embryo transgenic explants was able to induce direct somatic embryogenesis, with little callus formation and in the absence of exogenous auxin  <cit> . regarding this, stone and wojcikowska proposed that atlec <dig> may activate genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, such as yuc <dig>  yuc <dig>  yuc <dig> and yuc <dig>  <cit> . taken together, atlec <dig> is essential for maintaining embryogenic competency of plant somatic cells through complex interactions with transcriptional regulators and auxin  <cit> .

the lec genes are also involved in regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and storage lipid deposition during embryo development. the seed specific overexpression of zmlec <dig> and bnlec <dig> led to 35% and 20% increase in seed oil contents in maize and canola, respectively  <cit> . ectopic expression of atlec <dig> in arabidopsis leaves resulted in the accumulation of seed specific fatty acids  and increased the mrna level of oleosin  <cit> . furthermore, a direct downstream target of atlec <dig>  atwri <dig> is known to control fatty acid metabolism through interactions with key genes upstream in the pathway  <cit> .

although the functions of atlec <dig> have been extensively studied in arabidopsis, and homologs described in several plant species  <cit> , a functional ortholog has not been characterized in any other plants to date. we present here the identification of a putative ortholog of atlec <dig> in cacao, tclec <dig>  we characterized the expression patterns of tclec <dig> during both zygotic and somatic embryogenesis and explored the relationships between the activity of tclec <dig> in modulating the embryogenic potential of callus and in regulation of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.

RESULTS
gene isolation and sequence comparison
the arabidopsis atlec <dig> gene  is part of a large family of b <dig> domain containing proteins involved in a wide variety of functions. in the arabidopsis genome,  <dig> genes were previously annotated as b <dig> domain containing genes that were further classified into five different families: auxin response factor , abscisic acid-insensitive <dig>  of which atlec <dig> is a member, high level expression of sugar inducible , related to abi3/vp <dig>  and reproductive meristem   <cit> .

in order to identify a putative ortholog of atlec <dig> in cacao, the full-length amino acid sequence of arabidopsis atlec <dig> was blasted against the predicted proteome of the belizean criollo genotype   using blastp algorithm with e-value cut-off of 1e- <dig>  <cit> , which resulted in identification of  <dig> possible candidate genes . as a second approach to identify cacao lec <dig> gene , the predicted protein sequences of each of the  <dig> candidate genes were used to search the predicted proteome from a second sequenced cacao genome of cv. matina 1– <dig> v <dig>   by blastp and a set of nearly identical cognate genes were identified for each . no additional related genes were identified in this variety of cacao. of the  <dig> candidate genes, the gene tc06g <dig> resulted in the best alignment with atlec <dig>  resulting in a blastp expect value of 3e- <dig> 

to identify the most likely atlec2-orthologous gene, a phylogenetic analysis was performed with the  <dig> candidate cacao genes and several representative genes from each of the five b <dig> domain families in arabidopsis . the  <dig> cacao genes clustered with three of the b <dig> domain containing gene families . three cacao genes clustered within the abi <dig> subfamily, with one cacao gene pairing with each of the three arabidopsis members of this group , again suggesting that tc06g <dig> is the most likely ortholog of atlec <dig> in the cacao genome. this gene exists as a single copy and we tentatively designated it as tclec <dig> 

the annotation of tclec <dig>  in the cacao genome database predicted two translational start sites 72 bp apart. pcr primers were designed based on the most 5′ potential translation start site and a predicted full-length coding sequence of tclec <dig> was amplified from cdna extracted from sca <dig> mature zygotic cotyledons. a 1368 bp fragment was sequenced and after alignment with the tclec <dig> genomic sequence, a gene model was constructed, consisting of six exons and five introns, nearly identical to the atlec <dig> gene structure . the lengths of the first and last exons differ slightly and the remaining four are identical. the tclec <dig> encodes an open reading frame of  <dig> amino acid residues with the b <dig> domain predicted in the central region of the polypeptide. the full-length tclec <dig> protein shares 42% identity with atlec <dig> ; however, they are 81% identical within the b <dig> domain .

tclec <dig> is expressed primarily in endosperm and early mature embryo cotyledons
to investigate the function of tclec <dig> in cacao, its expression was measured by qrt-pcr in various tissues including: leaves at developmental stages a, c, and e , unopened flowers, open flowers, roots, endosperm and zygotic seeds at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  20 weeks after pollination . a cacao beta-tubulin gene  that was previously shown to exhibit stable expression levels during cacao seed development  was used for normalization. tclec <dig> was exclusively expressed in cacao endosperm and cotyledon , and significant levels of transcript were not detected in other tissues, consistent with the atlec <dig> expression pattern in arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, the expression of tclec <dig> was significantly higher in cacao cotyledons at  <dig> and  <dig> wap compared to  <dig> and  <dig> wap, stages previously defined as the onsets of cacao embryo morphogenesis and the seed maturation phase, respectively  <cit> . a similar biphasic expression pattern was reported for lec <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , suggesting a potential role of tclec <dig> in early developmental induction and in maturation phases of zygotic embryogenesis. notably, the transcript of tclec <dig> was accumulated to high levels in endosperm  when the embryo had just begun development . the endosperm functions to provide nutritive support to the developing embryo, and for crosstalk between maternal tissue and the embryo, being a critical determinant of successful embryo development  <cit> . therefore, the abundance of tclec <dig> transcript in the endosperm of developing cacao ovules suggests that tclec <dig> expression in endosperm could be involved in controlling embryo initiation in cacao.

ectopic expression of tclec <dig> was sufficient to activate seed specific gene expression in cacao leaves
to test the function of cacao tclec <dig> in regulation of gene expression and to identify its putative downstream targets, a rapid transient transformation assay using cacao leaf tissue was utilized  <cit>  . tclec <dig> was ectopically overexpressed under the e12-Ω modified camv35s promoter  in fully expanded young stage c cacao leaves using agrobacterium vacuum infiltration. agrobacterium containing empty based vector pgh <dig>   was also infiltrated in parallel as a control. as expected, tclec <dig> was highly expressed only in leaves transformed with e12Ω::tclec <dig> vector but was not detectable in control leaves . to identify the potential targets of tclec <dig>  a set of cacao putative orthologs of genes involved in seed development in arabidopsis was also assayed via qrt-pcr . the predicted ortholog of agamous-like  <dig>  a mads box type transcription factor involved in the induction of somatic embryogenesis from shoot apical meristems  <cit> , was highly induced  by tclec <dig> ectopic overexpression , which was consistent with the observation that lec <dig> and agl <dig> were able to activate each other in arabidopsis  <cit> . the predicted ortholog of aba insensitive  <dig> , which encodes a b <dig> domain transcription factor active during seed development and previously identified as a downstream target of atlec <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> , was also induced  by tclec <dig> . however, another b <dig> domain transcription factor fusca  <dig>   <cit>  was not responsive to tclec <dig> overexpression in leaf tissues under our experimental conditions . the predicted ortholog of wrinkled  <dig> , an ap2/ereb family transcription factor that is the direct downstream target of atlec <dig> and specifies atlec <dig> function toward fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> , was induced more than ten-fold by tclec <dig> . moreover, two genes encoding for oleosin proteins, involved in the structure of oil bodies, were also activated in cacao leaves by tclec <dig> ectopic overexpression . collectively, these results indicated that tclec <dig> was sufficient to induce the ectopic transcription of several important seed specific genes in cacao leaves, supporting its function as a key regulator of embryo and seed development.

ectopic expression in leaf tissues of genes involved in various dimensions of seed development calculated from qrt-pcr measurements

expression levels were normalized to tcacp <dig> . fold changes were calculated as a ratio of expression levels induced by tclec <dig> relative to expression levels in tissues transformed with the vector control lacking tclec <dig> and are the mean of three biological replicates . significance was established by t-test with p-value cut-off of  <dig> .

tclec <dig> expression is associated with embryogenic competency of callus cells
based on the above results, we reasoned that tclec <dig> might also be a key regulator of somatic embryogenesis. to explore this, tclec <dig> was measured in tissues grown with or without the se inducing hormone  <dig> -d . staminodes from the highly embryogenic cacao genotype psu-sca <dig> were used to produce primary somatic embryos  following our previously published protocol  <cit> . cotyledon explants  were excised and placed on secondary embryogenesis induction media with  or without  auxin  <dig> -d . after two weeks on these media, the tissues were transferred biweekly to hormone free embryo development media . the explants cultured on scg media started to produce calli two-weeks after culture initiation   and secondary somatic embryos were visible after four additional weeks . however, on scg- <dig> d, explants expanded and gradually turned green during the first six weeks, then stopped developing and turned brown. neither calli nor embryos were produced from the explants on scg- <dig> d medium .

tclec <dig> expression levels were measured in tissues cultured on both scg and scg- <dig> d media throughout the culture period . tclec <dig> expression was detectable in primary somatic embryo cotyledons at time  <dig>  then decreased significantly one day after explants were placed on either scg or scg- <dig> d media . tclec <dig> expression remained low in both treatments for the following two weeks, indicating that tclec <dig> was not rapidly responsive to exogenous auxin treatment during the induction period. however, between day  <dig> and  <dig> aci, tclec <dig> expression levels were slightly increased and variable in both treatments. notably, at 46 days aci the development of embryos was first observed on scg media arising from calli . rna was extracted from the embryogenic calli  and a large increase in tclec <dig> gene expression was observed by qrt-pcr. on scg- <dig> d media, embryos were not observed and tclec <dig> expression was not detectable.

a common occurrence in tissue culture is dedifferentiation of different types of calli that vary in their totipotency to regenerate somatic embryos  <cit> . with cacao tissue cultures, we and our collaborators have frequently observed two types of calli, those that produce abundant embryos  and those that produce few if any embryos  . to investigate the relationship between tclec <dig> activity and embryogenic potential of the calli, tclec <dig> gene expression was compared in embryogenic and non-embryogenic calli growing from explants cultured on scg media. the observed average levels of tclec <dig> expression were 20-fold higher in the embryogenic calli compared to the non-embryogenic calli of the same age , suggesting a tight association between tclec <dig> expression and embryogenic competency. given the role of atlec <dig> in controlling embryo development in arabidopsis, we hypothesized that tclec <dig> may play a similar role in the control of cacao somatic embryo development.

overexpression of tclec <dig> significantly increased efficiency of somatic embryogenesis and regeneration of transgenic embryos
the current methods for agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cacao genotype results in reproducible but very low rates of transgenic embryo recovery  <cit> . we speculate that this is a result of very low co-incidence of stable t-dna integration into the cacao genome and the same cells entering the embryogenic pathway. we hypothesized that overexpression of tclec <dig> might enhance the rate of somatic embryogenesis and thus improve the recovery of transgenic ses through increased co-incidence with t-dna integration events.

to test this, we performed agrobacterium-mediated transformation experiments on cotyledon explants excised from primary embryos for co-cultivation with agrobacterium containing the control vector  or the e12Ω::tclec <dig> vector . two weeks after co-cultivation, the initial transient expression levels of gfp in tissues transformed with the control vector were always higher than e12Ω::tclec <dig> . this may be due to the larger size of the e12Ω::tclec <dig> containing plasmid relative to the control vector, the inclusion of a repeated promoter element, or the addition of a third highly expressed transgene. we have observed this phenomenon with other unrelated plasmids containing transgenes .

during the subsequent weeks of culture on embryogenesis media, large numbers of non-transgenic embryos  were observed in all three independent transformation trials regardless of the presence of the tclec <dig> transgene . there was no consistently significant difference observed between the transformations of control vector and e12Ω::tclec <dig> in terms of the cumulative non-transgenic embryo production . to identify stably transformed embryos, gfp fluorescence was observed by stereomicroscopy as a visualization marker. with the control vector lacked the tclec <dig> transgene, no gfp expressing embryos were observed on over  <dig> cotyledon explants cultured in three separate experiments. surprisingly, the transformation with e12Ω::tclec <dig>  containing thetclec <dig> transgene, resulted in the recovery of over  <dig> stable transgenic embryos distributed over the entire surface of the cotyledon explant . this result was dramatically higher than the stable transformation results we have observed over many years, with several different transgenes, where the prior record for a single transformation  was  <dig> gfp positive embryos  <cit> . thus, although tclec <dig> did not impact the initial levels of transient transformation  or embryogenesis frequency of non-transgenic embryos , it greatly increased the frequency of transgenic embryo production, which confirmed our hypothesis.

although a large number of transgenic tclec <dig> embryos were obtained, most of them exhibited prominent developmental and morphological abnormalities , and most ceased development at the globular or heart stage and the initiations of cotyledons were significantly compromised. the few embryos that did develop to cotyledon stage formed callus on top of the cotyledons  and new embryos were occasionally initiated along the embryo axis . the attempts to recover plants from any of these embryos were unsuccessful.

to test the effect of stable overexpression of tclec <dig> transgene on iterative somatic embryogenesis, cotyledons from fully developed mature transgenic e12Ω::tclec <dig> embryos were excised and cultured for tertiary embryo production as previously described  <cit> . cotyledon explants from non-transformed psu-sca <dig> ses were cultured as controls. remarkably, cotyledon explants from transgenic e12Ω::tclec <dig> lines started to produce tertiary embryos as early as four weeks aci , compared to six weeks for psu-sca <dig> lines . additionally, while the majority of tertiary embryo production from psu-sca <dig> lines was completed by 14 weeks aci, after which very few ses were produced , explants from transgenic e12Ω::tclec <dig> lines continued to produce large numbers of embryos until twenty weeks aci, when the experiment was terminated . in total, within the twenty week period, transgenic e12Ω::tclec <dig> lines produced about  <dig>  times more tertiary embryos per explant  compared to psu-sca <dig> lines .

overexpression of tclec <dig> altered the expression of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis
in addition to its role in initiation of embryogenesis, it has been well documented in arabidopsis that atlec <dig> also regulates de novo fatty acid biosynthesis during embryo development. evidence includes, but is not limited to,  transgenic 35s::atlec <dig> ovules exhibited a mature seed-like fatty acid profile  <cit> ;  ectopic overexpression of atlec <dig> in leaves resulted in accumulation of seed specific lipids and very long chain fatty acids  <cit> ;  atlec <dig> directly regulates expression of atwri <dig>  which is known to play a role in regulation of fatty acid metabolism in developing embryos  <cit> . since fatty acids, in the form of triacylglycerols , are major storage components of mature cacao seeds, we examined the role of tclec <dig> in control of fatty acid biosynthesis in cacao immature zygotic embryos .

e12Ω::tclec <dig> was transiently overexpressed in izes  in parallel with the control vector . high transient expression was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy to detect egfp on approximately 90% of explants surfaces . overexpression levels of tclec <dig> in transformed izes were further confirmed by qrt-pcr and compared to the basal levels of tclec <dig> in control vector transformed izes . consistent with the observations in attached leaf transient assay , the overexpression of tclec <dig> resulted in elevated transcript of tcagl <dig> and tclec <dig> in the ize tissues . unlike in transiently transformed leaf tissue, induced expression of tcwri <dig> was not detected in the transformed izes under our qrt-pcr condition  .

to obtain further insights into tclec <dig> regulatory functions during embryo development, we identified the most likely orthologs of genes for key enzymes controlling the fatty acid biosynthesis and production of tags in the cocoa genome by homology to arabidopsis gene sequences  and compared their expression levels in izes tissues overexpressing e12Ω::tclec <dig> and control vector . mrna levels of tckasii , a condensing enzyme β-ketoacyl- synthase ii responsible for the elongation of c <dig> to c <dig>  <cit> , was two-fold lower  in the tclec <dig> transformed tissue compared to the controls . in addition, the predicted ortholog of tcfata  and two isoforms of tcfatb , two types of acyl- thioesterases that specifically export c18: <dig>  and other saturated fatty acid moieties  from plastid into cytosol  <cit> , were significantly up-regulated by more than  <dig>  fold . interestingly, the predicted diacylglycerol acyltransferase  <dig> , a key enzyme that catalyzed the last step of tag assembly through an acyl-coa dependent pathway  <cit> , was significantly up-regulated by  <dig>  fold . no significant differences in the expression levels of two isoforms of fatty acid desaturase  <dig>  were observed .

to determine if these changes in gene expression resulted in altered metabolite profiles, fatty acid composition was measured by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry  in izes tissues transformed with both e12Ω::tclec <dig> and control vector. overexpression of tclec <dig> resulted in a significant increase of the level of cis-vaccenic acid c18:1n- <dig> , an isoform of oleic acid , and significantly decreased the level  of linoleic acid  compared to tissues transformed with vector control .

discussion
tclec <dig> is involved in cacao somatic embryogenesis
somatic embryogenesis has long been considered a superior propagation system for many crops  <cit>  because of its inherent high multiplication rate and potential for year round, uniform disease free plant production. although theoretically, every somatic plant cell has the capacity to dedifferentiate and redifferentiate into a whole plant , the competencies of plant cells to enter the somatic embryogenesis developmental pathway varies dramatically between different tissues, developmental stages, and species. accumulated evidence has revealed that the activity of atlec <dig> is highly associated with embryogenic competency and involves interactions with several other regulatory factors. our results are consistent with a role of cacao tclec <dig> in the regulation of somatic embryogenesis similar to atlec <dig> in arabidopsis. supporting evidence includes;  ectopic overexpression of tclec <dig> in cacao stage c leaves was able to induce the expression of seed transcription factor genes, such as tcagl <dig>  tcabi <dig> and tclec1;  the induced expression level of tclec <dig> was associated with embryogenic capacity in explants;  constitutive overexpression of tclec <dig> in secondary somatic embryo tissue leads to earlier and increased regeneration of tertiary embryos compared to psu-sca <dig> controls. collectively, our evidence supports the conclusion that tclec <dig> is a functional ortholog of atlec <dig> and that it is involved in similar genetic regulatory networks during cacao somatic embryogenesis.

transient overexpression of tclec <dig> in cotyledon explants by itself was not sufficient to increase embryogenesis efficiency of non-transgenic somatic embryos . this suggests that there are other factor  that are required for cell dedifferentiation and redifferentiation, which are not present during the period of time examined in our embryogenesis culture system. however, the constitutive overexpression of tclec <dig> in stably transformed cells resulted in greatly enhanced somatic embryogenesis as early as four weeks compared to six to seven without tclec <dig> overexpression , implying that the enhanced activity of tclec <dig> is sufficient to promote the efficiency of somatic embryogenesis in cacao.

the very high degree of genotype variation in embryogenic capacity for se in cacao limits its’ practical application for large scale propagation  <cit> . therefore, tclec <dig> could be a useful molecular marker for screening cacao genotypes for high embryogenic capacities. additionally, the levels of tclec <dig> expression in callus and other tissues in vitro could be used for evaluating the effect of different media and other variables for further optimization of the se protocols. potentially, we could explore the possibility to promote somatic embryogenesis in cacao leaves or other tissues by ectopically expressing tclec <dig> 

tclec <dig> regulates fatty acid biosynthesis during cacao seed maturation
fatty acid composition and lipid profiles of cacao seeds are important quality traits for chocolate industry. therefore, there is great interest in identification of the genetic networks regulating its biosynthesis. lec <dig>  and its partners lec <dig>  abi <dig> and fus <dig> are known to be critical regulators of fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis in arabidopsis and other species, and thus impact many aspects of seed development. moreover, of particular relevance to applications of this knowledge, the level of wri <dig>  a downstream target of lec <dig>  lec <dig> and fus <dig>  was highly correlated with seed oil content in different b. napus genotypes  <cit> . our observations that tclec <dig> overexpression resulted in increased expression of tclec <dig> and tcwri <dig>  in attached cacao leaves promoted us to speculated that this might result in changes in fatty acid composition and tag assembly. indeed, transient overexpression of tclec <dig> in zygotic embryos resulted in increased c18:1n- <dig> and decreased c18:2n- <dig> levels , similar to changes occurring during cacao seed maturation when profiles change from mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids  to almost exclusively saturated  and monounsaturated fatty acid   <cit> . however, given the fact that the expression of tcwri <dig> was not induced by overexpression of tclec <dig> in immature zygotic embryos, it suggests that wri <dig> is not required to mediated impacts of tclec <dig> on fatty acid biosynthesis, and that the regulatory network between tclec <dig> and other transcription factors on fatty acid biosynthesis is not the same in cacao as they are in arabidopsis and b. napus. the overexpression of tclec <dig> also resulted in changes in gene expression for some of the major structural genes for fatty acid biosynthesis, and this could provide an explanation for the fatty acid composition shifts we observed. c18:1n- <dig> is synthesized from c16: <dig> via the production of c16:1n- <dig> by fab <dig> and further elongation to c18:1n- <dig>  <cit> . the decreased expression level of tckasii may increase the substrate availability of c16: <dig>  which could serve as a substrate for tcfab <dig> for the production of c16:1n- <dig> and further leading to c18:1n- <dig> accumulation . the increased levels of tcfata and two isoforms of tcfatb  could contribute to increased production and accumulation of saturated fatty acid  and monounsaturated fatty acid  during cacao seed maturation .

interestingly, the expression of tcdgat <dig> was also significantly increased by overexpression of tclec <dig>  but the expression level of tcdgat <dig>  was not affected . the activities of dgat genes were highly correlated with the oil content and compositions in oilseeds  <cit>  and three known types of dgat genes  are different in terms of substrate specificities and subcellular localizations  <cit> . according to an unpublished study, the expression of tcdgat <dig> in yeast has led to accumulation of more c18: <dig> in tag fraction compared to the expression of tcdgat <dig>  <cit> . considering the fact that the majority of tags in cacao mature seeds consist of unsaturated fatty acid  exclusively on sn- <dig> and saturated fatty acids  on sn- <dig> and  <dig> , it is plausible to speculate, that the activity of tcdgat <dig> is more significant to catalyze the final acylation on sn- <dig> of tag assembly compared to tcdgat <dig>  this argument was further supported by our result indicating that the expression level of tcdgat <dig> was approximately five times higher than tcdgat <dig> in cacao immature seeds . collectively, our data indicates that tclec <dig> could be involved in regulation of lipid biosynthesis during cacao seed maturation through control of tcdgat <dig> gene expression. however, whether tclec <dig> is able to directly trans-activate tcdgat <dig> or its action is mediated through other transcription factors, remains unknown. further research on the regulatory mechanism controlling fatty acid biosynthesis and tag assembly in cacao will contribute to identification of the key enzymes in the pathway and aid the screening process for elite cacao varieties to meet industrial demands.

CONCLUSIONS
the isolation and functional characterization of lec <dig> ortholog from cacao genome reveal crucial roles of tclec <dig> in regulating both zygotic and somatic embryogenesis. the exclusive expression pattern in seed and the identification of its regulatory targets, such as agl <dig> and wri <dig>  strongly indicate the functional similarities between atlec <dig> and tclec <dig>  however, the impacts of tclec <dig> on fatty acid biosynthesis in cacao also suggest that tclec <dig> is able to direct or indirectly interact with many key enzymes on the pathway, which has not been well characterized yet in arabidopsis. furthermore, the correlation between the activity of tclec <dig> and embryogenic potential during cacao somatic embryogenesis provides us a great opportunity to better understand and improve our current inefficient and variable propagation system of cacao.
