BACKGROUND
lignocellulosic materials are a readily available and renewable resource for biofuel and chemical production instead of starch, sucrose, or other resources that are better suited as food. pretreating the lignocellulosic materials, generally with diluted acid at a high temperature, is necessary to overcome the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulose and separate the cross-linked polysaccharides. however, with the release of sugars, toxic compounds, such as organic acids , furans , and phenolics are produced during the pretreatment process  <cit> . these toxic compounds inhibit the growth and fermentation efficiency of the microorganisms.

saccharomyces cerevisiae is recognized as a traditionally competitive cell factory for biorefining because of its superior tolerance to ethanol and low ph and its ease of genetic manipulation . the resistance of s. cerevisiae to organic acids and furans was extensively investigated. acetic acid enters yeast cells and causes a decrease of ph in the cytoplasm, inhibition of metabolism, and disruption of the proton gradient of the plasma membrane  <cit> . inhibiting the plasma membrane channel fps1p used for uptake of acetate and increasing the expression of major facilitator superfamily and atp-binding cassette transporters, which are responsible for acetate excretion, increases the resistance of s. cerevisiae to acetic acid  <cit> . furans cause reactive oxygen species  accumulation in cells and decrease energy production by inhibiting glycolysis, which prolongs the lag phase . increasing the expression of adh6p, adh7p, ald4p, gre3p, adh1p, ari1p, and gre2p, which have furfural or hmf reductase activity, or zwf1p, gnd1p, gnd2p, tdh1p, and ald6p, which increase the nadph supply, enhanced the rate of furfural and hmf detoxification in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . by comparison, only limited knowledge of s. cerevisiae tolerance to phenolics is reported.

phenolic compounds, which are generated from the segmental degradation of lignin exhibit strong detrimental effects, even at low concentrations, on the fermentation of s. cerevisiae  <cit> . this type of compound generally suppressed growth and ethanol production rate but had little effect on the ethanol yields . three kinds of phenolics that contain para-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl, respectively, exist in lignocellulose hydrolysate. in general, the most toxic to least toxic of these phenolics in order is para-hydroxyphenyl > guaiacyl > syringyl. adding a methoxy group to the aromatic ring can reduce the toxicity of phenolics by decreasing their hydrophobicity  <cit> . low-molecular-mass phenolic compounds are more potent inhibitors towards s. cerevisiae than high-molecular-weight phenolics  <cit> . vanillin is a simple guaiacyl phenol with high toxicity. at low concentrations, it is a more potent repressor of fermentation than other phenolic by-products derived from lignin  <cit> . moreover, the de novo synthesis of vanillin, a common additive of foods and cosmetics, has been recently achieved in yeast cells  <cit> . enhancing the strain resistance to vanillin is an important issue to achieve efficient vanillin production  <cit> . it was reported that vanillin triggers the accumulation of ros in cells, fragments the mitochondria  <cit> , and represses the translation process by blocking ribosomes assembly, which cause the accumulation of processing bodies and stress granules  <cit> . increasing the ergosterol level of s. cerevisiae enhanced the fluidity and stability of the membrane, improving the strain growth in the presence of vanillin  <cit> . converting the vanillin to vanillyl alcohol, which is less toxic than vanillin, by reductases is another important and efficient way for vanillin detoxification in yeast  <cit> . thus, it is of interest to identify the proteins that function in vanillin reduction while minimizing any reduction in ethanol yield or increasing the production of by-products.

in our previous study, the oxidoreductase activity of the vanillin-tolerant s. cerevisiae strain emv- <dig> was found to be significantly higher than its parent strain nan- <dig>  <cit> . in the present work, the significantly up-regulated reductases and dehydrogenases in emv- <dig> were identified and their roles in the detoxification of vanillin were characterized. the effect of overexpressing these genes on the ethanol fermentation was also studied.

RESULTS
up-regulated reductases in vanillin-tolerant s. cerevisiae
the vanillin-tolerant strain emv- <dig> obtained by adaptive evolution exhibited a high vanillin reduction rate and antioxidant capacity. the transcriptional analysis of emv- <dig> revealed an up-regulated oxidoreductase activity , which might convert the vanillin directly or supply the reduced coenzyme. to identify the roles of various dehydrogenases in vanillin tolerance, the up-regulated reductases and dehydrogenases in emv- <dig> were selected as studying candidates , as well as the gene adh <dig>  whose vanillin reductase activity has been previously identified  <cit> .table  <dig> the up-regulated reductases in vanillin-tolerant s. cerevisiae

adh6p is an efficient but not sole protein with vanillin reduction activity in s. cerevisiae
it was reported that purified adh6p has vanillin reduction activity in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, vanillin breakdown was not observed in an adh6Δ strain  <cit> . therefore, it was suggested that the vanillin conversion in s. cerevisiae was only dependent on adh6p  <cit> . however, the transcriptional level of adh <dig> in the vanillin-tolerant strain emv- <dig> was not higher than its parent strain nan- <dig> . therefore, adh6p did not contribute to increasing the vanillin reduction rate in emv- <dig> 

the role of adh6p in vanillin tolerance was further studied in the lab strain cen.pk102-3a. overexpressing adh <dig> increased the nadph-dependent vanillin reduction activity by 97 % and remarkably enhanced the strain growth in the medium containing vanillin . the strain overexpressing adh <dig> reduced 1 g l− <dig> vanillin to vanillyl alcohol in 9 h compared with 40 h for the control strain . deletion of adh <dig> decreased the growth of the strain in vanillin  where the reduction of vanillin was delayed but not eliminated. the adh6Δ mutant reduced 1 g l− <dig> vanillin completely in 54 h . our results revealed that adh6p is an important and efficient vanillin reductase, but there are other reductases capable of acting on vanillin in s. cerevisiae.fig.  <dig> overexpression of adh <dig> accelerated the growth in the presence of vanillin. the growth curve  and vanillin reduction  of strain bspj <dig>  and the strain overexpressing adh <dig>  in the sc-ura medium with 1 g l− <dig> vanillin. comparison of growth  and vanillin reduction  of adh <dig> knock-out strain  and cen.pk102-3a  in the sd medium with 1 g l− <dig> vanillin. all the data are the mean value ± standard deviation of independent duplicate tests

overexpressing ynl134c, yjr096w, ald <dig>  and zwf <dig> enhanced strain growth in vanillin
the up-regulated genes in emv- <dig>  were overexpressed in strain cen.pk102-3a. the empty vector transformed into cen.pk102-3a resulted in bsjp <dig>  which was used as the control.

overexpressing ynl134c, yjr096w, and ald <dig> slightly decreased the growth and ethanol yield of the resulting strains in vanillin-free medium . however, when vanillin was present, overexpressing ynl134c, yjr096w, and ald <dig> accelerated glucose consumption and ethanol production . the maximum specific growth rates of the strains overexpressing ynl134c, yjr096w, and ald <dig> were respectively  <dig>   <dig>  and 25 % faster than that of bsjp <dig>  which only contains empty vector, in the presence of 1 g l− <dig> vanillin. the ethanol yields of the strains overexpressing yjr096w and ynl134c both were 11 % higher than that of bsjp <dig> . the vanillin specific reduction rates of the strains overexpression adh <dig>  ald <dig>  zwf <dig>  ynl134c and yjr096w were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  g g− <dig> h− <dig>  respectively. compared to the  <dig>  g g− <dig> h− <dig> of control, only adh <dig> and zwf <dig> significantly increased the specific vanillin reduction rate. other genes may accelerate growth more than vanillin reduction. overexpressing the genes ara <dig>  ara <dig>  bdh <dig>  bdh <dig>  mdh <dig>  and idp <dig>  which were up-regulated in the vanillin-tolerant strain emv <dig>  did not enhance strain growth in the presence of vanillin .fig.  <dig> the growth and fermentation characteristics of strains. the cell growth , vanillin reduction , glucose consumption , and ethanol production  curves are shown. the fermentation was conducted in sc-ura with 1 g l− <dig> of vanillin. all the data are the mean value ± standard deviation of independent duplicate tests. symbols: bspj <dig> ; strains overexpressing ald <dig> , zwf <dig> , ynl134c , and yjr09w

the vanillin reductase activity, the ratio of nadh to nad+, and the ratio of reduced glutathione  to oxidized glutathione  of the strains were determined to distinguish whether the growth improvement was due to the enhanced vanillin reductase activity or the increased reduced-coenzyme and gsh supply. the enzymes encoded by adh <dig>  ynl134c and yjr096w prefer different coenzymes and exhibited notable vanillin reduction activity in vitro . the reductase activity encoded by adh <dig> mainly depended on nadph. overexpressing adh <dig> increased the vanillin reductase activity of strain by  <dig>  times. the reductase activity encoded by ynl134c mainly depended on nadh. the strain overexpressing ynl134c exhibited 153 % of the nadh-dependent vanillin reduction activity of the control strain. the enzyme encoded by yjr096w had both nadh- and nadph-dependent vanillin reduction activities. overexpressing yjr096w increased strain nadh- and nadph-dependent vanillin reduction activity by  <dig> and 69 %, respectively, while the ald6p and zwf1p did not contribute to the vanillin reduction activity of the test strains . the ratio of nadph to nadp+ from the strains overexpressing zwf <dig>  ald <dig>  ynl134c, and yjr096w were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times the control, respectively . the ratio of nadh to nad+ from the strains overexpressing zwf <dig> also increased 21 % compared to the control strain . furthermore, the ratio of gsh to gssg from the strains overexpressing zwf <dig>  ald <dig>  ynl134c, and yjr096w were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  times the control strain, respectively . this suggested that overexpressing zwf <dig> and ald <dig> enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the yeast strain.fig.  <dig> the crude enzyme activities ; the ratio of nadph to nadp+ ; the ratio of nadh to nad+ ; and ratio of cellular gsh to gssg  in recombinant strains. the fermentation was conducted in sc-ura medium. all data are the mean value ± standard deviation of independent duplicate tests



discussion
the vanillin tolerance of s. cerevisiae can be primarily attributed to its antioxidative and vanillin detoxification capacity  <cit> . the vanillin detoxification in yeast depends on the reduction of vanillin  <cit> . in the present study, we confirmed that overexpressing adh <dig>  ynl134c, yjr096w, ald <dig>  and zwf <dig> enhanced strain growth and accelerated vanillin reduction in the presence of vanillin. the enzymes encoded by adh <dig>  ynl134c, and yjr096w show in vitro detected vanillin reductase activities, however, only adh <dig> increased the vanillin specific reduction rate. the enzymes encoding by ynl134c and yjr096w may have more prefer substrates in vivo during the fermentation. for example, the acetaldehyde was one of favorite substrates of enzyme encoding by ynl134c  <cit> . furthermore, effects of ynl134c and yjr096w could be concealed on the high background activity of adh6p. therefore, overexpressing ynl134c and yjr096w did not increase the vanillin specific reduction rate. however, their whole accumulative contribution on vanillin detoxification should not be underestimated. yjr096w were found to response to dna damage  <cit>  and ynl134c encodes a non-zinc-containing mdr , which type of proteins behaved protective functions  <cit> . these characteristics may related to the enhancement of strain growth in the medium containing vanillin, but the mechanism is still not clear. while overexpression of ald <dig> and zwf <dig> enhanced the nadph supply, and increased the ratio of cellular gsh to gssg, which helped to improve the antioxidant activity of the strain.

certain aldehydes, such as furfural and hmf that derived from sugars and various phenolics that generated from the breakdown of lignin, are the main toxic compounds in lignocellulose hydrolysates. their detoxification is directly related to their reduction. therefore, the organism may benefit more from a multifunctional reductase than an enzyme specific to one or two aldehydes. the enzymes encoded by adh <dig>  ynl134c, and yjr096w all accept a wide range of substrates. the purified adh6p possessed a specific nadph-dependent reductase activity and accepted a broad range of substrates, including linear and branched-chain primary alcohols and aldehydes, substituted cinnamyl alcohols and aldehydes, as well as substituted benzaldehydes and their corresponding alcohols  <cit> . its high reduction activities towards furfural and hmf were also demonstrated  <cit> . the enzyme encoded by ynl134c was previously described as a nadh-dependent aldehyde reductase with activity towards formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and furfural  <cit> . the enzyme encoded by yjr096w is known as an arabinose reductase  <cit> . it also has high catalytic efficiencies towards aromatic aldehydes such as benzaldehydes and phenylglyoxal  <cit> . therefore, these genes may be of use to increase the strain tolerance to lignocellulosic materials. the reduced coenzyme is another limiting factor involved in aldehyde reduction. zwf1p catalyzes the first step  of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is the primary route for generating nadph in yeast  <cit> . ald6p provides nadph by converting acetaldehyde to acetate  <cit> . overexpressing ald <dig> and zwf <dig> increases the intracellular nadph radio, therefore enhancing the reduction of furfural, hmf  <cit> , and vanillin in our work. nadph is also an electron acceptor of gsh regeneration  <cit> . the gsh is the main component of the antioxidant system in living cells, scavenging ros by oxidizing to gssg. the increased ratio of gsh to gssg may help to protect the cells from intracellular ros accumulation induced by vanillin  <cit> . therefore, overexpressing ald <dig> and zwf <dig> may be a general strategy to increase the strain tolerance to lignocellulosic materials. however, because the generation of nadph is coupled with carbon flow to the pentose phosphate pathway and pathways generate byproducts, further effort is required to fine tune the expression of these genes to balance the product yield and strain tolerance.

CONCLUSIONS
the enzymes encoded by adh <dig>  ynl134c, and yjr096w have vanillin reductase activity, while overexpression of ald <dig> and zwf <dig> had positive effects on vanillin resistance and detoxification in s. cerevisiae, which was attributed to the enhancement of the nadph supply. overexpressing these genes enhanced the growth and metabolism of s. cerevisiae in environment containing the inhibitor vanillin. additionally, since the benefits of those genes to strain tolerance towards other toxic compounds found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, such as furfural, were suggested, overexpression of select genes may represent a general strategy for increasing the tolerance of s. cerevisiae to lignocellulosic materials and warrants further investigation.
