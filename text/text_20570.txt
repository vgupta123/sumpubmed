BACKGROUND
myo-inositol, a key cellular metabolite, is a simple six carbon ring sugar with one hydroxyl group on each carbon. myo-inositol is the precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol, an essential membrane lipid, an anchor for proteins, and a core component of signal transduction mechanisms  <cit> . inositol and compounds derived from inositol are among the major nonperturbing intracellular osmolytes which accumulate in response to hypertonic stress of the organism or tissue. stepwise phosphorylation of inositol yields the myo-inositol polyphosphates. inositol hexakisphosphate, in particular, has been found in soil, bacteria and most animals  <cit> .

cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen primarily infecting individuals with compromised immune systems. c. neoformans is found worldwide in soil and pigeon droppings. under environmentally dry conditions, the quiescent fungal spores in the soil or pigeon guano can become airborne. once in the air mammals can inhale the dehydrated yeast spores. the immune system of a non-immunocompromised individual typically eliminates c. neoformans with out any symptoms of disease. if the host is immunocompromised the pathogen can cause cryptococcosis. c. neoformans infections often localize to the brain and central nervous system   <cit> . c. neoformans is unusual among the fungi in that the pathogen can use inositol as a sole carbon source to support growth. catabolism of myo-inositol in c. neoformans is through the action of myo-inositol oxygenase , though this has not been confirmed as the only pathway  <cit> . the inositol concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid  is high . c. neoformans localized in the cns could utilize myo-inositol as a substrate for myo-inositol oxygenase  in order to generate glucuronic acid for energy production.

the conversion of myo-inositol to glucuronic acid by miox involves the cleavage of the inositol ring between the  <dig> c and  <dig> c, and a four-electron transfer with  <dig> atom of oxygen incorporated into the glonate, xylulose and xyulose-5-phosphate which can then enter the pentose phosphate pathway resulting in energy production.

this enzyme has been extensively studied in many eukaryotic organisms, recently crystallized, and modeled  <cit> . however, regulation of the miox protein in any organism has only recently been examined. transcription of the miox gene in humans has been shown to respond to osmotic response element  binding proteins and/or the tonicity-responsive enhancer  binding protein through conserved motifs  <cit> . expression of genes regulated by ore/tone binding proteins have been shown to increase when an ap- <dig> protein binding sequence is located downstream. in conditions of high osmolarity, this ap- <dig> mediated increase in transcription is inhibited by a-fos or tam- <dig>  <cit> . the promoter of a renal specific oxidoreductase with increased expression in diabetes mellitus, that has been experimentally determined to respond to inositol in media, also contains the conserved ore motif ggaaa  <cit> . an additional transcriptional regulating sequence, known as an inositol upstream activation sequence , has the conserved core sequence of canntg and has been identified upstream of several genes encoding proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism  <cit> .

in this study, three genes on separate chromosomes, encoding the miox protein, were identified in the c. neoformans genome. the miox promoter region, transcriptional regulatory sequences and myo-inositol binding pocket in c. neoformans were characterized. examination of the genes revealed differential regulation. this examination includes identification of upstream regulatory sequences such as ore, uasino, and tata boxes, introns, in-frame termination sequences, expressed sequence tags  and cpg islands for each sequence. molecular modeling of the three protein sequences indicated key differences between the isoforms possibly affecting the ability of two isoforms to bind the myo-inositol substrate.

RESULTS
miox gene identification and characterization
examination of the stgc c. neoformans genomic database using blast identified a sequence within chr <dig> b <dig>  that is a 100% match to the experimentally determined n-terminal sequence  <cit>  of the c. neoformans miox protein . the sequence was extracted along with an additional  <dig> bases upstream and downstream. a keyword search of the tigr c. neoformans computationally annotated database revealed three possible miox genes on separate chromosomes. tigr sequence  <dig> m <dig> mapped to chromosome  <dig>   <dig> m <dig> mapped to chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> m <dig> mapped to chromosome  <dig>  sequence  <dig> m <dig> contains the experimentally determined n-terminal region and aligns to contig chr <dig> b <dig>   in the stgc c. neoformans database. sequence  <dig> m <dig> aligns with contig chr <dig> b <dig>   and sequence  <dig> m <dig> aligns with chr <dig> b <dig>  . the sequence on chromosome  <dig>  is referred to as miox <dig>  chromosome  <dig>  is referred to as miox <dig> and on chromosome  <dig>  is referred to as miox <dig> 

computational analysis of the promoter region of miox <dig> revealed two possible conserved ores containing the consensus sequence ggaaa  <cit> . one of these putative ore sequences, gggaaaattga, is located at - <dig> upstream from the transcriptional start site. another putative ore, tggaaaaaaaga, is located - <dig> and is followed by an ap- <dig> binding sequence  located at - <dig>  one putative cis-acting inositol upstream activating sequences  catgtggaat was located at - <dig>  and matches the experimentally determined sequence  <cit> . miox <dig> has one predicted tata box starting at nucleotide - <dig>  est b9fo8h <dig> r <dig> in the tigr database aligned with bases -87– <dig>  280– <dig> with a 95% identity. est a7e05cn.r <dig> aligned with nucleotides 540– <dig> 823– <dig>  and 1007– <dig> with 93% identity . thus, the miox <dig> gene contains three introns with gt/ag splice sites confirmed by comparison of the genomic sequence to ests. four in-frame termination signals were located at the end of the genomic sequence.

within  <dig> nucleotides up-stream of the miox <dig> translation start two ore/tone sequences, one ap- <dig> sequence and one uasino were identified. within  <dig> nucleotides up-stream of the translation start for miox <dig> two ore/tone sequences were identified. no consensus ore/tone, ap- <dig> or uasino sequences were found within  <dig> nucleotide sequences upstream of the transcription start site for miox <dig> 

two ests were identified in the tigr database for both miox <dig> and miox <dig> with at least 93% identity. no ests were found for miox <dig> with an identity above 65%.

the genomic region  upstream of the translational start of miox <dig> contains two conserved ore sequences aggaaagctg and tggaaaactg located at - <dig> and - <dig>  neither sequence was followed by a conserved ap- <dig> sequence . two ests, from the tigr database were found to align with the coding region of miox <dig>  est d4e08j <dig> r <dig> aligns to bases -184– <dig>  86– <dig> and 322– <dig> . est a9e06cn.r <dig> aligns with nucleotides 664– <dig>  and 900– <dig>  . three introns with gt/ag splice sites were confirmed by comparison of the genomic sequence to ests. the ag at the 3'end of the splice site of a fourth computationally predicted intron was confirmed by comparison of the genomic sequence to est d4e08j <dig> r <dig>  the gt at the 5' end of this intron has not yet been confirmed by est data. four in frame termination signals were identified.

analysis of the genomic region  of miox <dig> upstream from the transcriptional start site for the miox <dig> protein has several computationally identified possible ore sequences. however, none of the sequences are strictly identical to the experimentally determined ore sequences and none are followed by a known ap- <dig> binding site. the miox <dig> sequence was determined to contain only one tata box starting at nucleotide  <dig> . no corresponding ests were identified in the tigr c. neoformans database with an alignment better than 65% . computational analysis, along with manual alignment of the coding dna from tigr database to the genomic sequence, predicted four introns in miox <dig>  miox <dig> genomic 3'sequence has four in frame termination signals.

miox <dig> and miox <dig> have a relatively few cpg islands when compared to miox <dig>  miox <dig> has five cpg islands in the upstream region that are approximately evenly spaced and several islands located internal to the gene. the five upstream cpg islands are located at -, -, -, - and -. miox <dig> has  <dig> cpg islands located from -, and -. miox <dig> has three cpg islands. one island is close to the transcriptional start located at -. the other two cpg islands identified in the miox <dig> gene are further from the start site located at - and -.

as rna stabilization can effect functional expression, the predicted rnas were examined. secondary and tertiary analysis of the computationally predicted rna showed no significant variance between the corresponding structures of the three genes .

miox sequence alignment and homology modeling
in the mus musculus miox protein the myo-inositol substrate has been determined to be buried in a pocket formed by two short sections of the protein and a hairpin loop  <cit> . multiple sequence alignment of the mus musculus miox protein sequence and the three miox protein sequences from c. neoformans reveals 100% identity for the two short sections of the protein . despite the similarity of the protein sequences and the conservation of several key amino acids, homology modeling of the putative proteins encoded by the three c. neoformans genes revealed some significant differences . the following amino acid numbering is based on the mouse protein  <cit> . amino acid asp- <dig> was previously identified to be critical for the binding of iron, which is necessary for optimal protein function. this amino acid  is conserved in all three c. neoformans miox proteins  <cit> . the hairpin loop consisting of  <dig> residues  in the mus musculus protein has an essential role in binding the myo-inositol by forming a lid that closes over the substrate in the active site. this hairpin loop secures the inositol substrate in place . the first eight residues in the hairpin loop sequence are strictly conserved in the miox <dig> protein. the next three amino acids of the hairpin loop in the miox <dig> protein  differ as follows: thr for val- <dig> replacing a neutral residue with a non-polar, ser for asp- <dig> inserting a neutral residue in place of an acidic residue and val for phe- <dig> both non-polar residues . the first three residues  and residues five through eight  in the miox <dig> and the miox <dig> predicted hairpin loops align with the experimentally determined hairpin loop identified in the mus musculus. the fourth residue of the hairpin loop has a substitution of ala for asp in both the miox <dig> and the miox <dig> proteins, replacing an acidic residue for a smaller non-polar residue. amino acid residues nine and ten of the hairpin loop are the same as those located in the miox <dig> protein . the last residue in the hairpin loop is phe in the mus musculus miox protein, val in the miox <dig> protein, and ala in the miox <dig> and miox <dig> proteins.

the hairpin loop is strongly conserved between the four proteins with only a few exceptions: a substitution of ala for glu- <dig>  and ala for phe- <dig> in miox  <dig> and miox <dig> proteins, a substitution of ser for asp  <dig> in all three miox protein sequences and a conservative substitution of val for phe- <dig> in the miox <dig> protein sequence.

the amino acids involved in the myo-inositol substrate lid are conserved among the four proteins with the exception of a substitution of ser for asp in all three computationally modeled c. neoformans miox proteins. predicted bonding distances indicate the salt bridge formation is conserved for miox <dig>  the distance measured between the substituted ser and arg in both computationally modeled miox <dig> and miox <dig> proteins  does not support the formation of a salt bridge at these locations.

analysis of the homology models of miox <dig> and miox <dig> proteins in c. neoformans indicates three key differences. the distance measured between asp-112/lys- <dig>  and asp-115/lys- <dig>  in miox <dig> and asp-160/lys-  <dig>  and asp-163/lys- <dig>  in miox <dig> protein support the formation of salt bridges similar to the mus musculus miox protein. however, the distances measured between ser-119/arg- <dig>  in miox <dig> protein and ser-167/arg- <dig>  in miox <dig> protein are too great to support the formation of a salt bridges . the homology models generated for miox <dig> protein and miox <dig> protein support main chain hydrogen bonds with arg- <dig> and gln- <dig> similar to the mus musculus miox. optimal alignment of the three miox proteins with mus musculus indicates a substitution of val- <dig> for thr- <dig> in the miox <dig> and val- <dig> for thr- <dig> in the miox <dig> protein. the substitution does not support the formation of a main-chain hydrogen bond at this location for either the miox <dig> or the miox <dig> protein .

the main chain hydrogen bonds involving arg and gln are predicted to be conserved in all four proteins. miox <dig> and miox <dig> protein share a substitution of val for thr disrupting the main chain hydrogen bond found at that location in the mus musculus protein. miox <dig> protein has a conservative substitution of glu for thr suggesting the preservation of that main chain hydrogen bond.

discussion
c. neoformans appears to be the only organism in the animal and fungal kingdoms with multiple miox genes. examination of over  <dig> completed eukaryotic genomes from the animal and fungal kingdoms revealed that if the miox gene is present, there is only one highly conserved copy . perhaps the three copies of the miox gene in the c. neoformans genome represents a physiological mechanism for survival in various environmental inositol concentrations.

this computational study suggests there are at least two sequences regulating transcription of the c. neoformans miox genes, one involves ore sequences, the other involves uasino sequences. ore sequences were originally identified in vertebrates and uasino sequences were demonstrated in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, but these sequences are present in the c. neoformans genome. as a basidiomycete the c. neoformans genome has been shown to contain features similar to other yeasts yet its gene organization is more complex resembling higher eukaryotes  <cit> . both miox <dig> and miox <dig> have two ore/tone sequences upstream of the genes. miox protein expression in humans has been demonstrated to be regulated by ore/tone binding proteins  <cit> . in vertebrates, the experimentally demonstrated binding sites for each transcription factor are slightly different. the core sequence tggaaa is recognized by ore binding protein, whereas the core sequence ggaaaa is recognized by tone binding protein . interestingly, comparison of the c. neoformans promoter regions of miox <dig> and miox <dig> reveals nucleotide differences in the identified ore/tone sequences suggesting differential regulation of the two genes. miox <dig> has two ore like sequences with the conserved tggaaa sequence coupled with an ap- <dig> binding sequence. this would render miox <dig> subject to a-fos and tam- <dig> inhibition. two tone like sequences are located in miox <dig> however, no ap- <dig> sequence was identified. the presence of the tone and the absence of the ap- <dig> binding sequences suggests miox <dig> is up-regulated in the presence of inositol but is not subject to inhibition by a-fos or tam- <dig>  <cit> . unlike miox <dig> and miox <dig>  the miox <dig> gene lacked a conserved ore/tone sequence within  <dig> base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site suggesting miox <dig> is not regulated by the ore or tone transcription factors.

in addition to the ore and ap- <dig> sequences, miox <dig> also contains a uasino sequence. several c. neoformans genes involved in phospholipid and phospholipid precursor biosynthesis  have been experimentally found to be regulated by the availability of inositol and choline in the medium  <cit>  studies of the transcriptional control coordinating expression of these genes in s. cerevisiae led to the identification of an upstream activating sequence  with a core conserved sequence of canntg  <cit> . the uasino has been found to specifically regulate genes via the ino2p/ino4p bhlh transcription factor complex in response to inositol and choline  <cit> . the uasino sequence experimentally demonstrated to serve for transcription activation is cattgaa  <cit> . the presence of a uasino in the upstream region of the c. neoformans miox <dig> but not miox <dig> or miox <dig> genes further suggests that the genes are differentially regulated. moreover, miox <dig> may be active when inositol concentration levels are low.

differential regulation is further supported by the identification of expressed sequence tags  for miox <dig> and miox <dig> but not miox <dig>  ests identified for both miox <dig> and miox <dig> in this study confirmed the computationally predicted start sites. furthermore the splice site junctions for miox <dig> and miox <dig> are supported by alignment of ests to genomic dna. ests for miox <dig> were not found however, the splice sites computationally predicted for miox <dig> are identical to the splice sites predicted by ests alignment for miox <dig>  duplicated nonfunctional genes are less likely to have ests  <cit> . unexpressed genes, genes expressed at very low levels or only under specific conditions are also less likely to have associated ests/cdnas. therefore the absence of ests for miox <dig> suggests either the gene is only expressed under specific conditions or is not expressed at all.

the identity of the miox <dig> and miox <dig> coding sequences  is significantly less than that of their amino acids . this can be attributed to changes in the wobble position. manual analysis of the aligned sequences revealed the majority  of the base changes to be in the wobble position. the synonymous changes allowed the identity of the dna sequences to decrease but did not change most of the amino acids encoded, thereby retaining the protein sequence identity. the conservation of the amino acid sequence despite changes in the dna suggests that the function of the protein is conserved through selective pressure.

the miox substrate, myo-inositol, is held in the active site by several key interactions. three salt bridges created between asp-85/lys <dig>  asp-88/lys <dig> and asp92/arg- <dig> form a lid that holds the substrate in the active site, along with main-chain h-bonds with thr- <dig>  arg- <dig> and gln- <dig> that stabilize the active site. all residues, essential in myo-inositol binding were found to be conserved in c. neoformans miox <dig> except thr- <dig> and asp- <dig>  optimal alignment of the mus musculus and c. neoformans miox <dig> protein sequences indicates a conservative substitution of thr- <dig> to glu and asp- <dig> to ser. thr and glu are both neutral residues and capable of participating in hydrogen bonds, indicating that the main chain hydrogen bonds found in mus musculus are all conserved in miox <dig>  asp- <dig> interacts with arg- <dig> to form a salt bridge  in the mus musculus miox protein. substitution of ser for asp- <dig> in c. neoformans miox <dig> potentially disrupts the salt-bridge formation however; the homology model generated in this study of miox <dig> indicates the distance between the amino acids  supports the formation of a salt bridge at that location despite the substitution.

protein sequence alignment and the homology models generated for the miox <dig> and miox <dig> proteins of c. neoformans also indicate three key differences from the mouse miox protein. unlike the changes in the miox <dig> protein where the active site is preserved, mutations in the miox <dig> and miox <dig> residues suggest disruption of the active site for myo-inositol possibly leading to decreased protein activity. optimal alignment of the mouse miox and c. neoformans miox <dig> and miox <dig> protein sequences indicates substitutions of thr- <dig> to val and asp- <dig> to ser. the change from thr to val disrupts one of the three main-chain hydrogen bonds that helps stabilize the myo-inositol lid. the loss of the h-bond between val and the main chain could be the cause of the increased distance between the ser and arg salt bridge  making the formation of a salt bridge at that location beyond the acceptable range. the destabilization of the lid may not allow miox <dig> and miox <dig> proteins to function efficiently.

CONCLUSIONS
multiple copies of the miox gene is unique to c. neoformans among the animal and fungal kingdoms. this study suggests that the c. neoformans genome has multiple copies of the miox gene which appear to be differentially expressed under various physiological inositol conditions. miox <dig> protein is predicted to be efficient in binding the myo-inositol substrate  <cit> . miox <dig> gene expression is probably active in conditions of low inositol via a uasino, up-regulated in the presence of inositol, yet possible inhibited by high levels of inositol by a-fos or tam- <dig> at the ap- <dig> site. this inhibition may be compensated for by the up-regulation of miox <dig>  although the miox <dig> enzyme is not predicted to be as efficient at holding the myo-inositol substrate in the active site, due to loss of disulfide bridges between the lid and main-chain and loss of main-chain hydrogen bonds, expression of miox <dig> should not be inhibited in elevated inositol levels due to the absence of an ap- <dig> binding sequence. this differentiated regulation of inositol catabolism could facilitate the growth and viability of c. neoformans in various environments.
