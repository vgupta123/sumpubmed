BACKGROUND
some phenotypic variation arises from randomness in cellular processes despite identical environments and genotypes  <cit> . population heterogeneity, resulting from such molecular stochasticity, has been documented in many microbial organisms including bacteriophage  λ  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit> , bacillus subtilis  <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . this within-population variation can have far reaching life history consequences. for example, experimentally reducing noise in the expression of comk decreased the number of competent b. subtilis cells in one study  <cit> . in another study, mutants of s. cerevisiae showing greater heterogeneity in survival had higher rates of occasional-cell survival during high stress conditions than did wild-type cells  <cit> .

because of their simplicity and ease of manipulation, phages are excellent models to explore the life history consequences of molecular stochasticity. many phages use a "holin-endolysin" system to compromise two physical barriers, the cell membrane and the peptidoglycan layer, in order to lyse an infected host cell  <cit> . although there are some variations on the theme, holin usually forms a hole in the inner membrane, thus either allowing soluble endolysin into the periplasmic space  <cit>  or activating the membrane-tethered endolysin already translocated to the periplasm  <cit> . endolysin then digests the peptidoglycan, causing host cell lysis.

the most extensively studied lysis system is that of phage l, which consists of four genes: s , r , rz, and rz <dig> . all genes are co-transcribed from the late promoter pr' during the late phase of the lytic cycle  <cit> . under typical laboratory conditions, only s and r are needed for host lysis, though both rz and rz <dig> are essential in the presence of high concentrations of divalent cations  <cit> .

the lytic pathway of phage λ is commonly divided into the early, delayed early, and late phases. transitions between stages are triggered by well-characterized molecular actions involving gene transcription and translation  <cit> . consequently, the timing of when individual cells enter each phase greatly influences the length of individual lysis times. a recent study by amir et al.  <cit>  showed that 69% of the total lysis time variance is due to variation in the time interval between the onset of the pr' promoter and the eventual lysis . this observation suggests that a large portion of the observed lysis time stochasticity is a de novo phenomenon, confined to the production and accumulation of holin proteins in the cell membrane, rather than a direct carryover from the various upstream stochastic events.

the formation of the λ holin hole in the membrane is hypothesized to be a multi-step process that starts with the transcription of the late mrna and the translation of the s holin protein. the resulting holin monomers are then inserted into the cell membrane, where they dimerize, then oligomerize  <cit> , eventually leading to the formation of higher-order holin aggregates, or rafts, in the cell membrane. at a time that is specific to the holin protein sequence, the holin rafts are transformed into a membrane lesion >  <dig> nm across  <cit> , which is large enough for the passage of a  <dig> kda protein  <cit> . lysis ensues after endolysin digests the peptidoglycan. thus, by regulating endolysin's access to the peptidoglycan, holin controls the timing of lysis  <cit> .

to formalize the heuristic model of holin hole formation described by wang et al.  <cit> , ryan and rutenberg  <cit>  proposed a two-stage nucleation model, in which the production rate of the holin monomers and holin self-affinity contribute to the aggregation of holin rafts. raft aggregation is opposed by thermal brownian motion which tends to disintegrate rafts into their holin constituents. as the rafts grow and then exceed a certain critical size , the probability of a second stage nucleation  increases . according to this model, lysis time stochasticity is the inevitable outcome of each infected cell in the population following its own time course of growth in holin raft size. however, a recent study  <cit>  using c-terminus gfp-fused λ s holin protein showed that, for most of the latent period, holin proteins are distributed uniformly in a relatively mobile state in the cell membrane. at a time that coincided with the triggering time, large immobile holin rafts suddenly appeared in the membrane. the transition from uniformly distributed holin to holin rafts occurred in less than a minute. although it is not clear whether these large rafts correspond to the membrane holes observed by cryoelectron microscopy  <cit> , this study nevertheless casts doubt on the previously hypothesized importance of holin raft size growth as the determining factor in lysis timing  <cit> . rather, it is proposed that the lysis time is determined by when a critical holin concentration is reached in the cell membrane . according to this model, lysis time stochasticity is mainly the result of variation in the timing of reaching the critical holin concentration in the membrane.

typically, the lysis time of a phage is estimated using a one-step growth curve  <cit> . in the case of phage λ, however, the availability of thermally-inducible e. coli λ lysogens allows a more precise determination of the lysis time by following the decline of culture turbidity  <cit> . direct observation of the lysis of individual λ lysogenic cells  <cit>  confirmed that the precipitous decline of culture turbidity, commonly observed among thermally-induced λ lysogen cultures, is a reflection of the saltatory nature of individual lysis events at the microscopic level. however, it is not clear to what extent the seemingly high synchronicity of lysis is influenced by various aspects of phage biology and host growth conditions. in this study, we used a simple experimental setup to assess how lysis time stochasticity is affected by allelic variation in the s protein, late promoter pr' activity, host growth rate, and the timing of energy poison kcn addition. our results establish the ranges and limits of lysis time stochasticity under various conditions.

RESULTS
using a microscope-mounted, temperature-controlled perfusion chamber, we observed and recorded individual lysis events of thermally-induced escherichia coli l lysogens . these observations revealed a considerable amount of variation in lysis time for the wild-type  λ phage . although the mean lysis time for the wt λ phage was  <dig>  min, lysis times for individual lysogenic cells ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  min. given that phage progeny accumulate linearly at ~ <dig>  phage per minute beginning ~ <dig> min after lysis induction  <cit> , the ~ <dig> min range of lysis times could result in a three-fold difference in burst size between phages that lyse early and those that lyse late. this result motivated further exploration of variation in lysis time among other λ strains.

effect of allelic variation in holin sequence
it has long been known that different holin alleles show different lysis times  <cit> . however, it is not clear to what extent allelic differences in holin protein would affect the lysis timing of individual cells. to gain further insight, we determined the mlts  and sds  of lysis time for  <dig> isogenic l lysogens differing in their s holin sequences . the directly observed mlts  were longer than those reported previously  <cit> . this discrepancy was mainly due to the fact that, in previous work, lysis time was defined by the time point when the turbidity of the lysogen culture began to decline, whereas in our current measurement, it was the mean of all individual lysis times observed for a particular phage strain.

effect of late promoter pr' activity
transcription of the late genes, including the holin gene s, from the pr' promoter marks the beginning of the late stage of the λ lytic development  <cit> . since the major determinant of lysis time is thought to be when a critical holin concentration is reached in the cell membrane  <cit> , reduced promoter activity should not only lengthen the lysis time, as shown in a previous study  <cit> , but should also increase the lysis time stochasticity  <cit> .

as shown in figure 3b, our data showed a negative relationship between the pr' activity, and the mlts, sds, and cvs. however, the increase of the pr' activity had a diminishing influence on both the mlts, as has been shown previously  <cit> , and the associated sds and cvs . interestingly, linear regressions  showed a much tighter, positive relationship between the mlts and the sds  and a significant positive relationship between the mlts and cvs . that is, for the wt s gene, every  <dig> minute increase in the mlt corresponds to  <dig>  minute increase in lysis time stochasticity.

effect of host growth rates
in general, cells growing at a faster rate have higher concentrations of various biosynthesis machineries  <cit> . since the expression of the phage holin gene is entirely dependent on the host, we hypothesized that a lower host growth rate would lead to a lower rate of holin protein synthesis, thus resulting in a longer lysis time and increased lysis time stochasticity. in the phage t <dig>  it was shown that lysis time was negatively correlated with host growth rate  <cit> .

we determined the mlts and sds for wild-type l lysogen grown in four different growth media: standard lb , 20% lb, davis minimal salts medium  with  <dig> mm glucose, and dm with  <dig> mm glycerol, resulting in growth rates of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig> , respectively . as shown in figure 3d, lower growth rates led to increased lysis time sds  and cvs . a similar negative relationship was also apparent for the mlts. however, because of the case of the lb medium, in which the higher growth rate actually resulted in a slightly longer mlt, the observed negative relationship was not significant . interestingly, neither the sds  nor the cvs  was significantly associated with the mlts.

effects of kcn addition
the energy poison potassium cyanide, kcn, has long been used in phage research to trigger premature lysis  <cit> . typically, after kcn addition, culture turbidity declines precipitously  <cit> , indicating that individual lysis events are relatively synchronous. the kcn-induced premature lysis is thought to be mediated through a collapsed proton motive force  resulting from a inhibition of the bacterial respiratory chain. as has been shown with λ s holin, a 40% drop in the pmf triggers lysis  <cit> . without a constant supply of atp, the production of holin protein would also be terminated. if kcn is added soon after thermal induction of the lysogen culture, few holin proteins would have been made before the termination of holin production. consequently, it should take a longer time for the holin proteins in the membrane to transition from a diffused state to aggregated rafts. therefore, after the cessation of holin production by kcn addition, it may take a longer time, on average, before any lysis events are observed. on the other hand, if kcn is added late, a larger proportion of the thermally-induced lysogenic cells should have accumulated enough holin proteins in the cell membrane such that they could be triggered to form holin holes quickly. that is, the addition of kcn should prompt the rapid formation of holin holes, thus resulting in an almost immediate and synchronous lysis of most of the cells in the population. based on the aforementioned scenarios, we expected that  the time delay between the time of kcn addition  and the eventual mean lysis time   would be negatively correlated with the timing of kcn addition, and  tkcn would be negatively correlated with lysis time stochasticity.

the effects of tkcn on lysis time sds and cvs are shown in figure 4b. again, we witnessed the expected pattern of a significant negative relationship between tkcn and the sds  and between tkcn and the cvs . these results showed that the later in time kcn was added, the less variation there was in individual lysis times. in fact, the lowest sd  and lowest cv  were observed when kcn was added  <dig> min after induction. this was a significant two-fold reduction in the sd when compared normal lysis conditions . this observation indicated that individual triggering for hole formation during the normal progression of cell lysis was relatively asynchronous when compared to the artificial method of acute triggering by kcn addition.

similar to the effect of growth rate, a linear regression of the sds  or cvs  against the mlts did not yield significant result. another interesting aspect of the relationship between tkcn and the lysis time sds is that the sds drop precipitously when kcn is added about  <dig> min after induction. this observation suggests that, approximately  <dig> min after thermal induction, the majority of the lysogenic cells have accumulated enough holin proteins in the cell membrane to form holes immediately if triggered.

discussion
the current model of holin hole formation hypothesizes that λ phage lysis timing is mainly determined by when a critical concentration of holin proteins is reached in the cell membrane  <cit>  . according to this model, any factor that influences the holin protein production should also affect the timing of lysis. furthermore, the realized rate of holin production in each cell should also be subjected to stochastic influences impacting the various upstream biochemical reactions, such as gene transcription and translation, that lead to holin production. as has been shown by others, the lower the average rates of the biochemical reactions, the more prominent the cell-to-cell variation is  <cit> .

manipulation of holin production rate
in our study, we manipulated the holin production rate by manipulating the λ pr' activity and the lysogen growth rate. we observed that, in general, treatments expected to result in higher holin production rates  also resulted in shorter mlts and smaller sds . furthermore, it was surprising that the combined mlts and sds, despite being from two different experimental treatments, namely pr' activity and lysogen growth rate, showed almost identical positive correlations, even after excluding the far-flung data point with the longest mlt and largest sd  from the analysis . this result suggests that, irrespective of how the mlt was achieved, as long as the mlts are the same, we should expect to observe similar sds. for the wild-type λ s holin sequence, any factor that results in  <dig>  min increase in mlt would be accompanied by a concomitant  <dig>  min increase in the sd. it would be interesting to conduct a similar experiment with different holin sequences to see if the rate of sd increase is sequence-specific.

regarding the effects of host growth rate on lysis time stochasticity, it is interesting to note the following. amir et al.  <cit>  found that the mlts, sds, and cvs, following uv induction, ranged from  <dig> min,  <dig> min, and  <dig> % respectively for λ lysogens alone to  <dig> min,  <dig> min, and  <dig> % respectively for λ lysogens carrying pr-gfp reporter plasmid and  <dig> min,  <dig> min, and  <dig> % respectively for λ lysogens carrying pr'-tr'-gfp reporter plasmid . since their λ lysogens were grown in m <dig> minimal salts medium plus various growth factors and  <dig> % glucose at 37°c, it is similar to our davis minimal salts medium with glucose, from which we obtained the comparable values of  <dig>  min,  <dig>  min, and  <dig> % respectively . it is not clear whether the difference between these two sds is the result of different methods used for lysogen induction  or different growth media, but the mlts are virtually identical. their result also indirectly confirmed our current result that host physiology  would affect the overall mlts and sds of lysis time.

manipulation of holin protein sequence
barring potential post-translational modifications due to differences in holin protein sequence , isogenic λ strains expressing different holin sequences would have a similar average rate of holin accumulation in the membrane and consequently the same distribution of holin proteins among the cells across different lysogen populations. that is, at any given moment, we would expect a certain proportion of cells to accumulate a certain number of holin molecules in the membrane, irrespective of the holin sequences. the observed differences in mlts, as the result of differences in holin sequence, can be seen as a reflection of different set-points for critical concentrations in an increasingly crowded cell membrane  <cit> . presumably, a sequence with a lower set-point would not only result in a shorter mlt, but also a smaller sd as well. however, the existence of similar mlts, but very different sds, suggests that missense mutations in the holin sequence not only affect the set-point for spontaneous triggering, but also impact the robustness of the set-point. for example, some mutations may be relatively insensitive to the critical holin concentration, thus resulting in proportionally more cells that are triggered earlier and later than expected, hence greater lysis time stochasticity.

effect of energy poison kcn
it is well known that addition of the energy poison, kcn, to induced lysogen cultures will accelerate the onset of lysis  <cit> . our results also confirmed this observation . however, it is not clear how this accelerated lysis would affect the lysis time stochasticity. from anecdotal observations, the addition of kcn seems to synchronize lysis, thus resulting in a precipitous decline of lysogen culture turbidity. our study showed that the timing of kcn addition was inversely related to lysis time stochasticity . in fact, the smallest sd  was achieved by adding kcn at  <dig> min after thermal induction , a time where normally only about 1% of the cells have lysed. the almost synchronous lysis when kcn was added  <dig> min post thermal induction suggests that most cells would have already accumulated enough holin proteins in the cell membrane to form a hole.

besides collapsing the pmf, the addition of kcn should also halt the production of holin protein, thus "fixes" the amount of holin proteins on the cell membrane at the time of addition. the progressive decline in lysis time stochasticity as kcn was added later in time  strongly suggests that a larger supply of holin protein is a key factor in ensuring synchronous lysis. as more holin proteins are inserted into the cell membrane, the kinetics of raft formation gradually shifts from stochastic to deterministic and synchronous. in fact, there was a nearly five-fold decrease in lysis time stochasticity when the pmf was collapsed at  <dig> min after lysogen induction when compared to collapse at  <dig> min . it is also noted that the properties of the normally triggered and the prematurely triggered holin holes are quite distinct, with the prematurely triggered holes being much smaller than the normally triggered holes  <cit> .

evolutionary implication of lysis time stochasticity
both theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated the importance of lysis timing on phage fitness  <cit> . however, it is not clear if lysis time stochasticity would have any impact on phage fitness. all else being equal, genotypes with reduced variances in offspring number would, in the long run, have higher fitness than genotypes that have the same mean offspring number, but larger variances  <cit> . overall, this suggests that natural selection would tend to minimize stochasticity in phenotypes that are closely linked to darwinian fitness. if the phage burst size is positively linked with the lysis time, as has been shown previously  <cit> , then selection for reduced burst size stochasticity should lead to reduced lysis time stochasticity as well. presumably, this hypothesis can be tested by competing two isogenic phage strains that have the same mlts but very different lysis time sds. interestingly, inspection of table  <dig> revealed that mutations introduced into wt λ holin sequence usually result in increased stochasticity, except in one case. it is not clear if this observation implies that the wt holin sequences have already been selected for reduced stochasticity in the wild as well. experiments with more phage holins should provide some hints in this respect.

CONCLUSIONS
even in a seemingly uniform environment, the lysis time can vary greatly among individual λ lysogenic cells . the extent of stochasticity, as quantified by the standard deviation, depends on the quality  and quantity  of the holin protein, the major determinant of lysis timing in large-genome phages. there is a general positive trend between the mean lysis time and the degree of stochasticity. however, this positive relationship is much tighter when difference in mean lysis time is due to holin quantity rather than quality. the pattern of lysis time stochasticity obtained by addition of kcn at various time points after lysogen induction showed a negative relationship between the timing of kcn addition and the level of lysis time stochasticity.

appendix a
this section provides the rationale for partitioning lysis time variance found in the study by amir et al.  <cit> .

for each uv-induced λ lysogenic cell, the lysis time t can be divided into three time intervals:  t <dig>  the time interval between lysogen induction and the onset of pr promoter,  t <dig>  the time interval between the onset of the pr promoter and the onset of the pr' promoter, and  t <dig>  the time interval between the onset of the pr' promoter and the eventual lysis. the following relationships describe the above time intervals and the empirically determined time intervals by amir et al.  <cit> : t <dig> = tpr, t <dig> + t <dig> = tpr'-tr', t <dig> + t <dig> + t <dig> = tlysis, and t <dig> = Δt = tlysis - tpr'-tr'.

for, t = t <dig> + t <dig> + t <dig>  the variance for the lysis time can be expressed as var = var + var + var + 2cov  + 2cov  + 2cov . while the authors did not provide all possible combinations of covariance, it is empirically determined that cov =  <dig>  as shown in their figure seven e . that is, cov = cov + cov =  <dig>  although not empirically demonstrated, it seems unlikely that the timing of turning on either the pr or pr' promoter would have a positive or negative effect on the assembly of lysis apparatus such that their effects would cancel each other out, resulting in the observed cov + cov =  <dig>  most likely, time intervals are mutually independent, i.e., cov = cov =  <dig> 

the standard deviations  for tpr'-tr' and tlysis can be extracted from their figure six a using data determined from cells carrying the pr'-tr'-gfp plasmid. the estimated sds for tpr'-tr' and tlysis are ~ <dig> min and ~ <dig> min, respectively; therefore, var = ~ <dig> and var = ~ <dig>  the sd for tpr can be estimated by extrapolating the line connecting between lysis and pr' onset to the  <dig> min mean time at the x-axis . the corresponding sd for tpr is ~ <dig> min, thus var = ~ <dig>  taken together, var =  <dig>  var =  <dig>  - var =  <dig> -  <dig> ), and var =  <dig>  - var =  <dig> - 100). that is, var, var, and var contributed to 15%, 16%, and 69% of total lysis time variance, respectively.

appendix b
studies of molecular stochasticity typically use the coefficient of variation  as the measurement for the degree of stochasticity  <cit> . since cv is a composite statistic , it is sometimes difficult to discern whether an increase in the observed stochasticity  is due to decrease in mean or increase in sd. in some cases, a different metric, such as phenotypic noise strength   <cit> , or a slight variant of it   <cit> , has been used as well. many times, it is not clear why a particular metric is used, except in the instance where the phenotypic noise strength is used to test against an a priori expectation of a poisson distribution, for which variance/mean =  <dig> 

it is understandable why the cv, or a variant, is used in certain situations. for example, if the means are drastically different from each other or a comparison is made between measurements using different units . in our study, however, the means were not very different and the same measuring unit  was used. therefore, we presented our means and sds separately and then jointly as cvs. except in one instance where presenting stochasticity as sd or cv makes a difference , all the other results showed that sd and cv followed the same trend. since cv can be derived from sd and mean, no information is lost by presenting them separately. furthermore, when the stochasticity  is not apparent, it may be advisable to present results as means and sds  separately, so that the impact of various experimental treatments on the noise distribution can be fully appreciated.
