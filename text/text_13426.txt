BACKGROUND
the carbonic anhydrases  are a family of zinc-containing metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in the reaction: co <dig> + h2o ↔ h+ + hco3-. they participate in several physiological processes, such as acid-base balance, co <dig> and hco3- transport, respiration, bone resorption, ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, production of body fluids, and fertilization  <cit> . the ca family consists of  <dig> active isozymes in mammals,  <dig> of which are expressed and function in humans  <cit> . the ca isozymes have diverse tissue expression patterns, characteristic subcellular localizations, as well as unique kinetic and inhibitory properties.

ca ix is a dimeric protein associated with the cell membrane  <cit> . in its mature form, ca ix is composed of an n-terminal proteoglycan  domain, a ca catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and a short intracytoplasmic tail at the c-terminus  <cit> . ca ix is the only member of the ca family containing a pg domain in addition to the ca domain. consequently, ca ix has been suggested to participate in cell adhesion processes. in fact, using mdck  epithelial cells, it was shown that ca ix reduces e-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion by interacting with β-catenin  <cit> .

ca ix is expressed in only few normal tissues with the expression being strongest in human, rat, and mouse gastric mucosa, where it is present from the gastric pits to the deep gastric glands  <cit> . ca ix is confined to the basolateral surface of epithelial cells and is produced by all major cell types of the gastric epithelium  <cit> . ca ix is an exceptional member of the ca family because it is expressed in several cancers that arise from ca ix negative tissues including renal, lung, cervical, ovarian, esophageal, and breast carcinomas  <cit> . however, gastric cancer and premalignant lesions have shown decreased expression of ca ix  <cit> . in tumor tissues, ca ix is linked with the hypoxic phenotype mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor  <dig> , which binds to the hypoxia responsive element, hre, of the ca <dig> promoter  <cit> . in hypoxic conditions, cancer cells are dependent mainly on anaerobic metabolism in their energy production. this anaerobic tumor metabolism generates excesses of acidic products, such as lactic acid and h+ that have to be extruded from the cell interior. it has been shown that ca ix can contribute to the acidification of the hypoxic extracellular milieu, thus helping tumor cells to neutralize the intracellular ph  <cit> . accordingly, ca ix overexpression often indicates poor prognosis and resistance to classical radio- and chemotherapies  <cit> . however, ca ix is not only confined to the hypoxic regions of the tumors, indicating that there might be some other pathways that regulate its expression. in fact, the expression of ca ix can be induced under normoxic conditions by high cell density, and this regulation is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  signaling  <cit> . moreover, the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway is involved in the regulation of ca ix expression via control of the ca <dig> promoter by both hif-1-dependent and -independent signals  <cit> . this pathway is also interrelated with the pi3k pathway and the sp <dig>  transcription factor.

the generation of car9-/- mice has revealed that in addition to ph regulation and cell adhesion, ca ix possesses other functional roles  <cit> . these car <dig> knockout mice showed no abnormalities in growth, reproductive potential, and life span. however, ca ix deficiency resulted in hyperplasia of the gastric mucosa. the hyperplastic mucosa contained an increased number and proportion of the mucus-producing pit cells whereas the number and proportion of chief cells was reduced. the total number of parietal cells remained unchanged, and accordingly, ca ix-deficient mice had normal gastric ph, acid secretion, and serum gastrin levels. thus, these findings demonstrate that ca ix contributes to the control of differentiation and proliferation of epithelial cell lineages in the gastric mucosa. a previous study examined whether the effects of ca ix deficiency could be modified by a high-salt diet, a known co-factor of carcinogenesis  <cit> . these results showed that the high-salt diet slightly increased the glandular atrophy in the body mucosa in car9-/- c57bl/ <dig> mice, whereas this effect was not observed in balb/c mice. however, no metaplastic or dysplastic abnormalities were seen in the gastrointestinal epithelium of ca ix-deficient c57bl/ <dig> mice. thus, these observations suggest that ca ix deficiency alone may not be a significant carcinogenic factor but could initiate a carcinogenic process by affecting cell proliferation and/or differentiation in the gastric mucosa.

this study was designed to better understand the hyperplastic phenotype of the stomach mucosa of car9-/- mice because the molecular mechanisms behind it are currently unknown. in addition, we wanted to more specifically elucidate the functional roles of ca ix, as there is a growing body of evidence showing that they extend far beyond ph regulation. for this purpose, a genome-wide expression analysis was performed. microarray data analysis revealed several genes whose expression was changed due to car <dig> gene disruption in the gastric mucosa.

RESULTS
transcriptional response to car <dig> deficiency in the stomach wall
stomach rna from  <dig> car9-/- mice and  <dig> wild-type mice was analyzed by microarray. the analysis revealed  <dig> upregulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes, using a fold change cut-off of ±  <dig>  for up- and downregulated expression, respectively . this cut-off value has been proposed as an adequate level above which there is a high correlation between microarray and qrt-pcr data, regardless of other factors such as spot intensity and cycle threshold  <cit> . the fold changes ranged from  <dig>  to - <dig> . herein, a list of genes using a cut-off value of ±  <dig> -fold is shown . when using these criteria, all the genes with significantly  altered expression are displayed, that is,  <dig> genes with induced expression and  <dig> genes with repressed expression. the list of all the regulated genes was functionally annotated , showing enrichment of hydrolase activity, developmental processes, cell differentiation, proteolysis, peptidase activity, structural molecule activity, and immune system process, among others. the functional annotation categories and gene numbers in each category are shown in table  <dig> 

*a representative category for the following overlapping categories: epidermis morphogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, epidermis development, ectoderm development, tissue development, organ development, anatomical structure development, anatomical structure morphogenesis, cellular developmental process, multicellular organismal development, and epidermal cell differentiation.

confirmation of microarray results by qrt-pcr
changes in the expression levels of selected genes were confirmed, and microarray results were validated by qrt-pcr using the same rna samples as those used for the microarray. fourteen genes with notable fold change values were selected for validation based on the results of functional annotation. the selected genes involved representatives from different functional categories. thirteen  out of  <dig> genes showed concordant results between microarray analysis and qrt-pcr . the sole discrepant result was pkp <dig>  which was upregulated according to the microarray and did not change according to the qrt-pcr .

discussion
a previous study showed a hyperplastic phenotype of gastric body mucosa in car9-/- mice  <cit> . ca ix deficiency led to overproduction of gastric pit cells and reduction of chief cells. quite surprisingly, the gastric ph of ca ix-deficient mice remained unaltered. based on these observations, it can be concluded that the main role of ca ix in the stomach mucosa is not related to ph regulation but it is required for normal gastric morphogenesis and homeostasis within the gastric mucosa. in this paper, we report alterations in mrna expression that might contribute to the phenotypic changes reported in the stomach of car9-deficient mice. however, one must take into consideration that some of these changes can merely reflect differences in the relative proportions of various cell types within the gastric mucosa.

as expected, the car9-/- phenotype changed the expression of genes involved in developmental processes and cell differentiation. the depletion of chief cells in car9-/- gastric mucosa may be explained by the significant downregulation of the basic helix-loop-helix family, member a15/mist <dig>  gene, which is a class b basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factor that exhibits acinar cell-specific expression  <cit> . mist <dig> gene expression is observed in a wide array of tissues with serous type secretion including the pancreas, salivary glands, chief cells of the stomach, paneth cells of the small intestine, seminal vesicles, and lacrimal glands  <cit> . the deletion of mist <dig> blocks normal mucous neck cell redifferentiation into zymogenic chief cells as all basal zymogen-secreting cells in mist1-/- mice show multiple structural defects  <cit> .

another interesting candidate with regard to cell lineage disturbance in the gastric epithelium of ca ix-deficient mice is epidermal growth factor , which has an expression that was significantly decreased when compared to wild-type mice. among growth factors, the egf family includes important agents for gastric mucosa. egf is a single-chain polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues, which is found mainly in the submandibular glands and brunner's glands of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . egf binds and activates the epidermal growth factor receptor resulting in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival  <cit> . interestingly, several investigators have reported that egf receptors are enriched in rodent chief cells  <cit> , suggesting the importance of egf function in these cells. therefore alterations in the expression of egf receptor ligands or, in this case, egf could contribute to the differentiation and function of chief cells.

one of the most strongly upregulated genes of this study was deleted in malignant brain tumors  <dig> , which belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich  superfamily of proteins. this is a superfamily of secreted and membrane-bound proteins with srcr domains that are highly conserved down to sponges  <cit> . the expression of dmbt <dig> is the highest in epithelia and is usually observed on the apical cell surface or in luminal exocrine secretions. in mice, dmbt <dig> is most strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal system  <cit> . dmbt <dig> is proposed to be a tumor suppressor  <cit>  and/or a regulator of epithelial differentiation  <cit> , as well as having roles in innate immune defense and inflammation  <cit> . dmbt <dig> is located in the crypt cells of the human, mouse, and rabbit small intestine  <cit>  and the neck region of normal human gastric mucosa  <cit> , which are predominantly composed of stem/progenitor cells. thus, this gene is potentially involved in the physiological renewing process of gastrointestinal epithelia. a role for dmbt <dig> in innate immune defense has been demonstrated in various studies. the human dmbt <dig> glycoprotein, expressed in salivary glands, airways, and genital tract, binds various bacterial pathogens and viruses  <cit> . additionally, expression of mouse dmbt <dig> in the gastrointestinal tract is regulated by bacteria  <cit> , and its expression is increased during infection  <cit> . it has also been shown that there is an association of a dmbt <dig> variant allele with crohn's disease and there is a correlation of expression levels of dmbt <dig> with inflammatory bowel disease severity  <cit> .

furthermore, dmbt <dig> binds surfactant proteins sp-d and sp-a. these are collagen- containing,  calcium-dependent lectins called collectins which interact with glycoconjugates and lipids on the surface of microorganisms mostly through their carbohydrate recognition domains   <cit> . sp-d and sp-a are involved in a range of immune functions, including viral neutralization, aggregation and killing of bacteria and fungi, and clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells. in immunologically naïve lungs, they downregulate inflammatory reactions, but when challenged with lps or apoptotic cells they induce phagocytosis by macrophages, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and enhancement of adaptive immune responses  <cit> . it is interesting that in the present study, in addition to dmbt <dig>  the expression of surfactant associated protein d  was highly induced in car9-/- mice. thus, the upregulation of both dmbt <dig> and sftpd suggest that ca ix deficiency induced an immune process in the gastric mucosa. it should also be noted that ca ix has been suggested to bind to dendritic cells in a receptor-mediated manner and scavenger receptors appear to play an important role in this process  <cit> . in addition, ca ix seems to activate an immune response by a mechanism characteristic to heat shock proteins. thus, ca ix could directly interact with dmbt <dig> via a scavenger receptor.

in fact, the disruption of car <dig> gene caused disregulation of several genes that are involved in immune processes. this corroborates the results from a previous study where gastric submucosal inflammation was detected in the body region in a majority of c57bl/ <dig> car9-/- mice  <cit> . in the present study, il1rl1/st <dig> transcript variant  <dig> mrna was highly induced due to ca ix deficiency. the il1rl1/st <dig> gene is a member of the interleukin- <dig>  receptor family and produces a soluble secreted form  and a transmembrane form , coded by transcript variants  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the membrane-bound form is expressed primarily by hematopoietic cells and the soluble form is predominantly expressed by fibroblasts  <cit> . in particular, st2l is preferentially expressed in murine and human th <dig> cells and can be used as a specific marker of th <dig> cells in in vitro experiments  <cit> . therefore, the function of st2l has been suggested to correlate with th <dig> cell-mediated immunological responses and il- <dig>  a newly discovered member of the il- <dig> cytokine family, has been reported as a specific ligand for st2l  <cit> . interestingly, several studies have shown that the level of soluble st <dig> in sera is elevated in asthmatic disease  <cit> . therefore, it has been suggested that soluble st <dig> may also play a critical role in th <dig> cell-mediated diseases. in fact, it has been demonstrated that soluble st <dig> acts as an antagonistic decoy receptor for il- <dig> using a murine thymoma cell line, el- <dig>  which stably expresses st2l, and a murine model of asthma  <cit> . this suggests that soluble st <dig> negatively modulates the production of th <dig> cytokines through il- <dig> signaling in allergic airway inflammation. it is interesting to note that in the present study, the mrna level of il- <dig> was also elevated ~ 2-fold, although this change was not statistically significant. thus, it seems plausible that ca ix is somehow involved in regulation of the th <dig> response.

ca ix could also contribute to the development of the immune system as ca ix deficiency significantly downregulated the bloom syndrome homolog  gene , which encodes an atp-dependent dna helicase that belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of recq helicases  <cit> . mutation of blm causes a rare human autosomal recessive disorder called bloom's syndrome , which is characterized by marked genomic instability. bs is associated with growth retardation, profound susceptibility to most cancer types, and immunodeficiency  <cit> , with the latter two features accounting for early death  <cit> . the functions of blm have been only partially characterized. however, it has been shown that blm has a role in the proliferation and survival of both developing and mature t lymphocytes, and its deletion leads to defective t-cell immunity  <cit> . additionally, the conditional knockout of blm contributed to compromised b cell development and maintenance, strongly impaired t cell-dependent and -independent antibody responses after immunization, and a propensity for developing b cell lymphomas  <cit> . therefore, it is conceivable that car9-/- mice have compromised acquired immunity responses.

an unexpected finding was that several small proline-rich proteins  were notably upregulated including sprr1a, sprr2d, sprr2e, sprr2i, and sprr <dig>  however, only the induction of sprr1a was statistically significant. sprr proteins were originally identified as markers for terminal squamous cell differentiation where they are precursors of the cornified envelope  <cit> . additionally, sprr proteins are expressed in various nonsquamous tissues, and their biological function is not restricted to structural proteins of the cornified envelope  <cit> . it has been shown that sprr proteins participate in the response to various stresses in many tissues without a stratified epithelium. in the biliary tract, sprr <dig> members appear to contribute to modification of the biliary barrier under conditions of stress  <cit> . likewise, sprr1a has been identified as a novel stress-inducible downstream mediator of gp <dig> cytokines in cardiomyocytes with a cardioprotective effect against ischemic stress  <cit> . furthermore, in mice, sprr2a protein was reported to be highly induced in gastric mucosa infected by helicobacter heilmannii  <cit> . in addition, it has been suggested that sprr1a is a regeneration-associated protein because its induction in neuronal injury correlates with regenerative capacity, with virtually all injured dorsal root ganglion neurons expressing sprr1a one week after sciatic nerve injury  <cit> . therefore, sprr genes are presumably induced in response to different stress conditions and contribute to cell protection, tissue remodeling, and/or tissue regeneration. in the light of these findings it seems plausible that ca ix deficiency creates a stress condition in the gastric mucosa, which leads to upregulation of some protective factors.

our analysis identified mrnas from four members of solute carrier family proteins to be misregulated in the car9-/- mice stomach mucosa. these solute carrier proteins are involved in membrane transport of various molecules. the expression of slc9a <dig> was strongly induced, whereas the expression of slc27a <dig>  slc38a <dig>  and slc5a <dig> was repressed. the basic function of slc9a <dig> or nhe <dig> is the exchange of extracellular na+ for intracellular h+, thus causing either a rise in intracellular ph or, if coupled to the action of other transporters, an increase in cell volume  <cit> . in the gastrointestinal tract, slc9a <dig> is expressed in the apical membrane and recycling endosomes of the ileum, jejunum, colon, and stomach  <cit> . further studies are needed to elucidate the possible interplay between ca ix and slc9a <dig> in the gastric mucosa.

surprisingly, among the most downregulated genes we found several genes involved in digestion. these included trypsin  <dig>  amylase 2a <dig>  chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 2a, and pancreatic lipase with statistically significant p-values and others, such as chymotrypsinogen b <dig>  carboxypeptidase a <dig>  and carboxypeptidase b <dig> with nonsignificant p-values. the implication of this finding remains unclear. a possible explanation for this might be that downregulation of these enzymes is a secondary event. if it is assumed that these enzymes are produced by chief cells, the reduced number of chief cells in the car9-/- mice gastric mucosa can also cause a decrease in the amount of the enzymes they produce. however, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, ca ix deficiency was shown to alter the expression of various genes in the gastric mucosa. the number of affected genes and the magnitude of changes were relatively high, indicating that ca ix has a remarkable role in gastric functions. microarray analysis revealed several genes involved in developmental processes and cell differentiation, which could explain the cell lineage disturbance in the gastric epithelium of car9-/- mice. interestingly, some of the regulated genes identified in this study are involved in digestion as well as functions of the immune and defense responses. this finding suggests that ca ix deficiency compromises the immune system in the gastric epithelium implying yet another role for this multifunctional enzyme.
