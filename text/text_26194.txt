BACKGROUND
let us consider a dna sequence as a mathematical string 

 x=x <dig> x <dig> …,xn, 

 where x
i
∈{a,g,c,t} is one of the four nucleotides, i= <dig> ,…,n, i.e. a denotes adenine, c cytosine, g guanine and t thymine. in these conditions, the sequence x is of length n.

our main goal is to compare the sequence x with another dna sequence 

 y=y <dig> y <dig> …,ym, 

 to measure the similarity between both strings and also to determine their residue-residue correspondences.

sequence comparison and alignment is a central and crucial tool in molecular biology. for example, pairwise sequence alignment is used to identify regions of similarity that may indicate functional, structural and/or evolutionary relationships between two biological sequences   <cit> .

for some recent developments and directions we refer the reader to  <cit>  and  <cit>  for a general review of different alignments methods.

to align the sequences cgt and actt, one can use emboss needle for nucleotide sequence  <cit>  that creates an optimal global alignment of the two sequences using the needleman-wunsch algorithm to get

 emboss-0011-cgt3|·|emboss-0011actt <dig> 

following lesk  <cit> , in order to compare the amino acids appearing at their corresponding positions in two sequences, theirs correspondences must be assigned and a sequence alignment is the identification of residue-residue correspondence. for some references on sequence alignment we refer the reader to  <cit> .

to compare two sequences, there exist mainly three different possibilities leading to three different numbers of total alignments  <cit> : 

 <dig>  the total number of alignments denoted by f that was solved in  <cit> .

 <dig>  a gap in a sequence is followed by another gap in the other sequence as in alignments  <dig> and  <dig> for the sequences x=cgt and y=actt  considering the two alignments as equivalents to the alignment  <dig>  without gap in those positions, we have the number of reduced alignments denoted by h, and obviously h<f. this case has been solved in  <cit> , and we give here another representation in terms of hypergeometric series.

 <dig>  in the interesting case that the alignments  <dig> and  <dig> are equivalent, but different from alignment  <dig> we have a number or reduced alignments g where h<g<f. this last case is new and we present an explicit formula for g.

RESULTS
number of 
f
 alignments
the total number of alignments f satisfies the following recurrence relation  <cit> 

 f=f+f+f, 

 with initial conditions f=f= <dig> for n,m= <dig> , <dig> …. the solution of the above partial difference equation is given by 

 f=∑k=0min{n,m}2kmknk, 

  in  <cit> ) and the generating function  <cit>  is 

 f=−1xy+x+y− <dig>  

 therefore the coefficients f in the expansion 

 f=∑n=0∞∑m=0∞fxnym 

 are given in terms of a hypergeometric series by 

 f=2f <dig>  

this relation seems to be new in this form. here, the generalized hypergeometric series is defined as  

 pfqa <dig> …,ap;b <dig> …,bq;d=∑i=0∞a1ka2k⋯apkk!b1kb2k⋯bqkdk, 

 and 
k
=a⋯, with 0= <dig>  denotes the pochhammer’s symbol. it is assumed that b
j
≠−k in order to avoid singularities in the denominators. if one of the parameters a
j
 equals to a negative integer, then the sum becomes a terminating series.

number of 
h
 alignments
in this case, the recurrence relation for the h coefficients is  <cit> 

 h=h+h−h,n,m≥ <dig>  

 with initial conditions h=h= <dig>  therefore, the generating function  <cit>  is 

 h=1−xyx2y2−x−y+ <dig>  

 and the coefficients in the expansion 

 h=∑n=0∞∑m=0∞hxnym 

 are given by 

 h=∑i=0ai!i!!!−∑i=0bi!i!!!, 

 where 

 a=minn <dig> m <dig> b=minn− <dig> m− <dig>  

the above coefficients can be written in terms of  hypergeometric series as 

 !m!n!4f31−m <dig> −m <dig> −n <dig> −n2−m−n <dig> −m−n+ <dig> −m−n+231627−!!!4f31−m <dig> −m <dig> −n <dig> −n2−m−n+ <dig> −m−n+ <dig> −m−n+ <dig>  

number of 
g
 alignments
as indicated before, the main aim of this paper is to give an explicit representation in this case. the recurrence relation for the g coefficients is  <cit> 

 g=g+g+g−2g,n,m≥ <dig>  

 with initial conditions g=g= <dig>  thus, the generating function  <cit>  is 

  g=1−xy2x2y2−xy−x−y+ <dig>  


theorem  <dig>  the coefficientsα
n,m
in the expansion

  g=1−xy2x2y2−xy−x−y+1=∑n=0∞∑m=0∞αn,mxnym 

are explicitly given by

  αn,m=∑i=un+m∑j=abβi,j,n,m−∑i=u−1n+m−2∑j=cdγi,j,n,m, 

where

  βi,j,n,m=i−j2i−ji!!!!!, 

  γi,j,n,m=i−j2i−ji!!!!!, 

  a=max <dig> i−m−n <dig>  

  b=mini,2i−m,2i−n,4i−n−m <dig>  

  c=max <dig> i−m−n− <dig>  

  d=mini,2i−m+ <dig> i−n+ <dig> i−n−m+ <dig>  

  u=m−n/ <dig> n≤m,/2+n−m,n≥m, 

and  denotes the integer part of x.


proof. if we expand, 

  g=∑i=0∞x+y+xy−2x2y2i=×∑i=0∞∑j=0i∑k=0j∑s=0ki−j2i−jijjkksy2i−j−sx2i−j−k+s, 

we have two summands to be computed, namely 

  ∑i=0∞∑j=0i∑k=0j∑s=0ki−j2i−jijjkksy2i−j−sx2i−j−k+s 

  −xy∑i=0∞∑j=0i∑k=0j∑s=0ki−j2i−jijjkksy2i−j−sx2i−j−k+s. 

in order to compute the first sum  let us introduce 

  m=2i−j−s,n=2i−j−k+s. 

therefore, the summation to be done reads as 

 ∑n=0∞∑m=0∞∑i=uv∑j=abi−j2i−jijj4i−2j−m−n4i−2j−m−n2i−j−mxnym 

 where u, v, a and b must be computed in terms of the initial indices.

the product of binomials can be simplified to 

 i!!!!!. 

 thus, 

 i≥ <dig> j≥ <dig> i−2j−m−n≥ <dig> i−2j−m−n≥ <dig> i−j−m≥ <dig> i−j≥ <dig> i−j−m≥ <dig> i−j−n≥ <dig> j−4i+m+n≥ <dig>  

 and then 

 a=a=max <dig> i−m−n3≤j≤mini,2i−m,2i−n,4i−n−m2=b=b. 

finally, the summation reads as 

 ∑n=0∞∑m=0∞∑i=un+m∑j=abi−j2i−ji!!!!!xnym, 

 where 

 u=m−n/ <dig> n≤m,/2+n−m,n≥m. 

a similar work with the second summand  leads to the final result.

some numerical values are g= <dig>  g= <dig> × <dig>  g= <dig> × <dig>  and we note that g> <dig> for n≥ <dig>  this last inequality is relevant since  <dig> is an estimation of the number of protons of our universe  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a unified approach for a wide class of alignments between two dna sequences has been provided. we conclude also that our approach gives an explicit formula filling a gap in the theory of sequence alignment. the formula is computable and, if complemented by software development, will provide a deeper insight into the theory of sequence alignment and give rise to new comparison methods. it may be used also, in the future, to get explicit formulas and compute the number of total, reduced, and effective alignments for multiple sequences.
