BACKGROUND
two-component signal systems are the main means for sensing the changing environment in a prokaryotic world  <cit> . typically, bacterial signal transduction systems consist of two components, a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. a specific compound or a physicochemical property of the environment acts as a signal triggering the activation of a membrane embedded sensor, which in turn autophosphorylates and thereafter passes the signal to a response regulator via phosphoryl group transfer  <cit> . phosphorylated response proteins mostly act as dna binding transcription factors by activating or repressing the expression of target genes.

the number of genes for two-component proteins varies greatly between the genomes of sequenced bacteria, being for instance zero in case of mycoplasma genitalium and  <dig> in a well-known model organism escherichia coli  <cit> . the abundance of two-component systems seems to correlate with environmental and pathogenic versatility of a bacterium. pseudomonas bacteria that colonise different habitats such as soil, water, plants and animal tissues, possess many two-component signal systems to cope with various environments. for example, over a hundreds genes encoding two-component system proteins are present in the genome of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> .

the colrs two-component signal transduction system, intrinsic to pseudomonas species, consists of a sensor kinase cols and a response regulator colr. colrs operon is well-conserved among the sequenced members of pseudomonas genus  <cit>  suggesting that colrs system could be important to these bacteria. colrs pathway was first characterised in p. fluorescens as a system involved in the ability of bacteria to competitively colonise plant roots  <cit> . our group observed a totally different function for colrs system as transposition of tn <dig> was inhibited in phenol-starving colr- and cols-deficient p. putida  <cit> . additionally, recently, we demonstrated that colr-deficient p. putida is sensitive to phenol  <cit>  and displays a serious defect on solid glucose medium where a subpopulation of the mutant lyses  <cit> . colrs system was also shown to be important in resistance of p. putida to divalent metal ions, especially mn2+  <cit> . importantly, the precise checkpoint of a response regulator colr remained unclear in case of all these colr-dependent phenotypes. however, two recent publications suggest that seemingly unrelated phenotypes of colr-deficient p. fluorescens and p. putida can most probably be explained by the compromised cell membranes of colr mutants. namely, the first colr-regulated genes that were identified in these two species, encoded different membrane functions. we demonstrated that oprq and algd, which encode a porin protein and an exopolysaccharide alginate biosynthesis enzyme, respectively, are under the direct control of colr in p. putida  <cit> . concomitantly, de weert et al  <cit>  reported for p. fluorescens that an operon downstream of colrs hypothetically coding for membrane associated proteins, methyltransferase  and lipopolysaccharide kinase , is also regulated by colr.

in spite of several recent studies disclosing the colrs system as an important signal transduction pathway for pseudomonads, little is known about the downstream components of this signal system. only two target genes of colr have been identified in p. putida  <cit>  and our unpublished data show that neither oprq nor algd are involved in phenotypes characteristic to colr mutant. thus, more colr-regulated genes should be present in the genome of p. putida. in this study we aimed to determine the colr binding consensus sequence and to use it in the screen of p. putida genome for the presence of new potential colr binding sites, which would predict new colr target genes and operons.

RESULTS
colr  regulates the expression of pp0903
the expression of genes downstream of colrs operon is regulated by colr in p. fluorescens  <cit> . this region of genome is well conserved among pseudomonas bacteria  <cit>  and therefore we presumed that the operon downstream of colrs  could be regulated by colrs system in p. putida as well. this downstream operon consists of three genes . the first two, pp <dig> coding for a putative methyltransferase and pp <dig> coding for a lipopolysaccharide kinase inaa, are conserved among all  <dig> fully sequenced pseudomonads  <cit> . putative orthologs of the third open reading frame pp <dig> encoding for a hypothetical protein are present downstream of inaa in  <dig> sequenced members of pseudomonas genus. in order to test whether these genes belong to colr regulon in p. putida, we cloned the upstream region of pp <dig> in front of lacz gene in a promoter probe plasmid p9ttblacz and compared plasmid-encoded β-galactosidase activities in wild-type p. putida strain paw <dig> and in its colr-deficient derivative. our unpublished results show that colr-dependent phenotypes are more pronounced on solid medium if compared to that in liquid medium. therefore, all enzyme activities presented in this study were measured from solid-medium-grown bacteria. the obtained data showed that colr is a positive effector of pp <dig> expression since β-galactosidase activity was comparable to the basal level of promoter probe vector p9ttblacz in a colr-deficient strain but was 10-fold higher in a wild-type strain . as our previous study showed that colr-regulated oprq and algd promoters were affected by phenol  <cit> , the β-galactosidase activity was also measured in the presence of phenol. again, the activity of pp <dig> promoter remained indistinguishable from the basal level of vector in the colr-mutant strain . however, phenol significantly enhanced the activity of pp <dig> promoter in a wild-type strain where colr is present . to confirm the role of colr in the activation of pp <dig> promoter, β-galactosidase measurements were also performed in colr-mutant derivative pawrtaccolr where the expression of colr was inducible from ptac promoter with addition of iptg. the activity of pp <dig> promoter was already recovered in pawrtaccolr strain without the induction of colr . this was expected as immunoblot analysis of colr expression had previously revealed significant leakiness of ptac promoter in that particular strain  <cit> . over-expression of colr resulted in a strong enhancement of pp <dig> promoter over the wild-type level both on glucose and glucose plus phenol medium . hence, response regulator colr is indeed necessary for up-regulation of pp <dig> promoter in p. putida. strong induction of the promoter by colr over-expression suggests that either the amount of colr is limiting in the wild-type cells or the cols-activating signal is low in tested conditions. data also imply that the impact of colr on the pp <dig> activation becomes more prominent in bacteria experiencing phenol-caused stress.

colr binding sites in the promoter regions of oprq  and pp0903
one possible way to find new target genes of a transcriptional regulator is to computationally analyze the whole genome of an organism. as a certain binding consensus of a transcription factor is needed for that, we aimed to specify the exact binding sites of colr in the promoters under its control. our previous paper demonstrated that purified histidine-tagged colr bound in vitro to the promoters of oprq and algd in a gel mobility shift assay  <cit> . similar analysis with pp <dig> promoter showed that colr also directly interacts with this promoter dna. in order to map the colr binding sites we performed a dnase i footprinting assay to the dnas of oprq, algd and pp <dig> promoter fragments labelled with p <dig>  fig. 2a illustrates the colr-recognized regions in the promoters of oprq and pp <dig>  colr protected a 24-to-26-bp-long area in both promoters  depending on a strand analysed. colr binding sites reside about  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides upstream of translation start codons of oprq and pp <dig>  respectively. the binding of colr to pp <dig> promoter resulted in the appearance of a hypersensitive site for dnase i just next to the colr-protected region . data also showed that the phosphorylated form of colr  binds to the dna with higher affinity than the unphosphorylated colr. however, the effect of phosphorylation was stronger in case of pp <dig> compared to oprq .

despite the fact that colr bound to the promoter dna of algd in a gel mobility shift assay  <cit>  we could not detect a colr-binding site in this dna by dnase i footprinting . this suggests that the binding dynamics of response regulator colr could be somewhat different if algd promoter is compared to the promoters of oprq and pp <dig>  most probably colr recognition sequences in the algd promoter diverge from colr consensus .

computer search for potential colr binding sites revealed several new colr-regulated genes
comparison of colr recognition sequences in the promoters of oprq and pp <dig>  shows clearly that these two sequences are similar. the most obvious common feature is a central t-track, 5-bp and 7-bp long in case of oprq and pp <dig>  respectively . in total  <dig> identical nucleotides are present in these two colr binding sites allowing to deduce a 13-bp-long consensus motif for colr binding – acgnntttttnac. high similarity of the two colr binding boxes suggested that a genome-wide computer search could reveal new potential target genes of colr. thus, sequences similar to identified colr binding sites were searched from the genome of p. putida kt <dig> using two free-access web-servers, predictregulon  <cit>  and virtual footprint  <cit> . several inquiries with varying input sequence length and strand orientation were performed. results of both programmes were compared and identical hits were chosen for experimental validation. actually, the prediction and identification of new colr binding sites presented below was a step-by-step process meaning that new predictions were made with every additional confirmed colr binding site . for experimental evaluation of the computer-predicted putative colr-regulated promoters, they were cloned into a promoter probe plasmid p9ttblacz upstream of the lacz gene. if a predicted colr-binding site was located between two divergently transcribed genes, then this dna region was cloned upstream of the reporter in both orientations . β-galactosidase activities were measured in wild-type and colr-deficient p. putida cells grown overnight on glucose and glucose plus phenol solid media. additionally, since promoter activity of pp <dig> was strongly enhanced by over-expression of colr  all promoters were tested also in a p. putida strain pawrtaccolr where the expression of colr can be induced from ptac promoter. results of β-galactosidase assay show that promoters of pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig> and pp <dig> are responsive to the absence and/or to the over-expression of colr . all promoters except pp <dig> are positively affected by colr. if promoters were tested in the presence of  <dig>  mm phenol then the effects of colr-deficiency and over-expression became more evident in case of most promoters. for instance, while promoters of pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig> and pp <dig> were only barely affected by the absence of colr in the glucose-grown cells, then the impact of colr upon these promoters became obvious in the glucose plus phenol-grown bacteria. it is also remarkable that all promoters analysed responded significantly more to the over-expression than to the absence of colr. namely, colr over-expression clearly enhanced the activities of promoters that are under its positive control . especially drastic activation was seen in case of pp <dig> where over-expressed colr caused 30-fold increase in the promoter activity when compared to that in a wild-type strain . at the same time, the activity of pp <dig> promoter was only 3-fold lower in glucose-grown colr mutant than in wild-type. analogous to that, the over-expression of colr lowered the activity of negatively colr-affected pp <dig> promoter about 3-fold but the lack of colr affected this particular promoter less than 2-fold . this data strongly suggest that either colr amount is limiting in wild-type p. putida to affect significantly the expression of analysed target promoters or the signal perceived and transduced by cols is low under the conditions employed by us.

it is important to point out that one new colr-regulated gene, pp <dig>  locates just upstream of colrs genes and is transcribed divergently from pp <dig> encoding colr . thus, the putative colr-binding site affecting the expression of pp <dig> is actually located between pp <dig> and colr. analysis of this particular promoter in the direction of colr  did not reveal clear colr-responsiveness under any conditions examined . therefore we conclude that colr does not auto-regulate its own expression.

colr binding sites in the promoters of predicted target genes
we aimed to confirm that in silico predicted colr binding sites upstream of different genes, which expression was colr-dependent in vivo, could really bind colr. for that purpose, we performed a dnase i footprinting analysis to six promoter regions that were tested in a β-galactosidase assay . figure 4a shows colr protection patterns of five different promoter regions – pp0035/ <dig>  pp <dig>  pp0900/ <dig>  pp2560/ <dig> and pp <dig>  the length of colr-protected area varied between the promoters analysed ranging from 18-bp in one strand of pp <dig> up to 46-bp in pp <dig> . phosphorylation of colr by cols significantly increased its affinity to dnas upstream of pp0900/ <dig>  pp2560/ <dig> and pp <dig>  the binding of colr to several promoter dnas changed the dnase i digestion pattern revealing new hypersensitive sites for dnase. paradoxically, colr could not affect the dnase i digestion pattern of the pp <dig> promoter , although, this promoter was influenced by colr in vivo  and colr binding to this dna was clearly detectable in a gel mobility shift assay . it is noteworthy that the same was seen in case of colr-regulated algd promoter . thus, performed footprint analysis could not reveal all colr binding sites in the promoters of its target genes. nevertheless, data presented in fig.  <dig> verifies that colr indeed binds to the computationally predicted sites in five new colr-responsive promoters.

colr binding consensus and potential regulon
the sequences of seven colr binding sites identified by dnase i footprinting analysis  were aligned to define a more precise colr binding consensus than initial one, which was deduced only from two binding motifs detected in the promoters of oprq and pp <dig>  the length of the region protected by colr varied significantly in different promoters . therefore, rather long dna fragments  were compared in order to find out whether sequences surrounding the core colr-recognition site are conserved as well. fig.  <dig> demonstrates a colr binding consensus created using weblogo server  <cit> . in the middle of the sequence a well-conserved 16-bp-long core with  <dig> totally conserved positions is present, whereas most of the distant positions are much less conserved. therefore, only the core region was defined as a final colr binding consensus nanntttttac). next, this 16-bp-long core was used to predict minimal regulon of colrs system.  <dig> colr binding motif-resembling sites were extracted from p. putida genome by searching the upstream regions  of all genes using a predictregulon server tool. as several binding sites locate between divergently transcribed genes one may assume that colr regulon potentially consists of more than  <dig> different genes . however, whilst the first  <dig> sites of prediction match perfectly with  <dig> input sequences, the rest of the matches score lower than the cut-off value . therefore, they should be considered as potential novel colr sites, which should be confirmed experimentally. it is notable that three genes  predicted as colr-regulated possess two potential colr-binding sites in their promoter regions . there are genes of different functions in the predicted regulon of colrs two-component system , but in accordance with previous results, this signal system seems to regulate many membrane associated functions. namely, 56% of putative colr binding sites locate upstream of genes implicated in various membrane functions. furthermore, inspection of the first  <dig> sites shows that even 87% of them locate upstream of genes coding for membrane proteins . it is also remarkable that about one third of the putative members of colr regulon code for hypothetical proteins .

discussion
two-component signal transduction systems reside at the top of regulatory cascades. therefore, to decipher the role of a particular two-component pathway it is crucial to specify the downstream components of the cascade. this study focuses on identification of target genes of a pseudomonas two-component system colrs, thus serving as an indispensable step in the way of unravelling the mechanisms that trigger different phenotypes related to colrs deficiency.

previously, we have searched for colr-regulated genes by using a promoter library created from total chromosomal dna of p. putida  <cit> . this screen disclosed only two colr target genes, thus forcing us to try different approach to acquire more information about the putative regulon of colrs system. we aimed to define a binding consensus for the transcription factor colr and to search for similar sequences in the upstream regions of genes in the genome of p. putida. seven experimentally verified colr binding sites demonstrated a highly conserved colr-binding motif with  <dig> fully conserved nucleotides in the 16-bp-long core binding box . the binding motifs of ompr subfamily response regulators, among whom colr belongs , consist typically of direct repeats separated by four to five nucleotides  <cit> . careful inspection of colr binding sites reveals that there are also two direct repeats. although one of the repeats is much less conserved than the other, such structure of the binding site indicates that colr binds to the dna as a dimer. notably, our data suggest that in addition to the highly conserved core sequence, colr may also recognize and bind to less conserved sites. namely, colr regulates algd promoter in vivo and binds to this promoter in a phosphorylation-dependent manner according to gel mobility shift experiments  <cit> . yet, computational analysis could not find a good colr binding motif and dnase i protection analysis did not locate colr binding site in the promoter region of algd. nevertheless, the sequence upstream of algd contains many t-rich tracks characteristic for colr binding consensus. if we lowered the specificity of virtual footprint prediction by allowing three mismatches in the input consensus then four putative colr binding sites were found in algd promoter region, which was previously shown to bind colr in dna shift assay . probably colr binds to these less conserved and thereby with lower affinity sites, but dna cleavage by dnase i destabilizes the colr-dna complex and hence the colr protected area cannot be detected by dnase footprint assay. analogously, the nucleoprotein complex between the colr and the upstream region of pp <dig> probably dissociates due to dnase i cleavage-caused destabilization.

given that some promoter regions  contain putatively more than one colr consensus-resembling site  one may hypothesise that co-operative binding of colr to several sites may be necessary for regulation of these colr target promoters. in this connection it is interesting to note that in silico analysis of seven experimentally verified colr-binding promoters, revealed more putative colr boxes than identified by dnase footprint assay. namely, promoter regions of oprq, pp0900/ <dig> and pp2560/ <dig> contain additional less-conserved colr boxes . further experiments should prove whether these additional sites really support colr binding to these promoters.

in this study several new colr-dependent promoters were identified. intriguingly, the effect of colr absence upon promoter activities was rather modest  or not detectable  when bacteria grew on glucose medium . the greatest effect was seen in case of pp <dig> promoter whose activity was 10-fold down-regulated in a colr-deficient p. putida . however, the role of colr in regulation of its target genes was confirmed by analysis of promoter activities under conditions of colr over-expression. indeed, most promoters tested were strongly influenced by colr over-expression, especially when phenol was present in the growth medium . this data indicate that the amount of transcriptionally active colr is not sufficient enough to influence significantly most of its target promoters in wild-type p. putida in our assay conditions. given that the phosphorylated form of colr bound to its recognition sequences more avidly it is reasonable to conclude that actually the phosphorylated form of colr is limiting in bacteria growing on glucose solid medium. therefore, we consider that most probably the cols-activating signal is low under our assay conditions. colr over-expression could apparently mimic the conditions evoked by the signal and therefore the colr-dependence of its target promoters was seen more clearly in the situation of colr over-expression. this scenario is in good accordance with our previous data showing that over-expression of colr can compensate the defect in signal transfer from cols to colr when the participation of colrs system in regulation of tn <dig> transposition was examined  <cit> . the signal sensed by cols is not known so far. however, our observation that the impact of colr on the expression of its target promoters was greater in the presence of phenol  indicates that phenol-caused stress could be one of the conditions where colrs signal transduction pathway is, at least partially, activated. this suggestion agrees with our previous results demonstrating the participation of colrs system in phenol tolerance of p. putida  <cit> .

current study shows that colr regulates directly genes locating upstream and downstream of its own gene. like in p. fluorescens, colr of p. putida also activates the downstream of colrs locating operon, that was suggested to be involved in fine-tuning of the outer membrane permeability  <cit> . it is notable that colr regulates several other outer membrane protein-encoding genes confirming the role of colrs system in the regulation of membrane functionality  <cit> . in addition to our previous finding that outer membrane protein-encoding oprq is negatively controlled by colr  <cit> , the current study revealed that colr is a negative factor also for pp <dig> which codes for a protein orthologous to lipid a 3-o-deacylase pagl in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . the outer membrane-locating pagl modifies lipopolysaccharides by deacylation of lipid a at 3-o-position  <cit> . pagl becomes important under specific conditions only, e.g., it will be needed for mutants deficient in aminoarabinose-modified lipid a to resist cationic antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria the pagl-dependent deacylation of lipid a reduces the ability of lipid a to activate the toll-like receptor  <dig> of the host, thus helping pathogens to avoid innate immune recognition  <cit> . the role of pagl has not been studied in p. putida so far.

our data show that besides affecting the composition of outer membrane, colr also regulates other membrane compartments. for instance, colr activated pp <dig> and pp <dig> coding for two cytoplasmic membrane-locating enzymes, putative type  <dig> phosphatidic acid phosphatase  and diacylglycerol kinase dgka, respectively. these two enzymes most probably affect the membrane lipid homeostasis as they reversely regulate the abundance of phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, the precursor of phospholipid synthesis and the by-product of the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides, respectively  <cit> . given that prediction of colr regulon revealed another fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism related gene acpp , coding for acyl carrier protein, as a putative colr target gene, indeed, colrs system may be involved in phospholipids homeostasis.

since colr is highly conserved among all pseudomonas species  <cit>  it was reasonable to presume that colr-binding sites may also be similar in pseudomonads. genome-wide prediction of potential colr-binding sites in p. fluorescens pfo- <dig> disclosed seven genes that could be members of colr regulon both in p. putida and p. fluorescens . namely, colr-binding box was found upstream of p. fluorescens pfo- <dig> genes orthologous to p. putida dgka- <dig>  colr/pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig>  pp <dig> and pp <dig> . additional screening of p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  p. syringae tomato dc <dig> and p. syringae phaseolicola 1448a revealed that all these organisms contain perfect colr-recognition sites upstream of dgka- <dig> orthologs. therefore, it is highly possible that dgka is a member of colr regulon in all these pseudomonads.

CONCLUSIONS
current study identified a 16-bp-long binding consensus of response regulator colr nanntttttac), which helped us to discover new genes controlled by colrs two-component system in p. putida. notably, several new colr target genes  code for different membrane proteins supporting our previous assumption that the primary target of colrs two-component system is the cell membrane. regulon prediction suggests that colr could regulate over  <dig> genes and many of them code for membrane-associated functions as well. however, it is not clear yet which of the target genes are responsible for specific colr-related phenotypes such as lowered phenol tolerance, hindrance of transposition of tn <dig> and glucose-induced lysis of a subpopulation of the colr mutant  <cit> . considering the number of colr regulon genes it is highly possible that not one but several colr target genes are involved in the formation of above-mentioned phenotypes. given that colrs two-component system is regulating several membrane-related genes, our further experiments are directed towards clarification the role of colr target genes in the membrane functionality.
