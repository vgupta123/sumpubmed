BACKGROUND
bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a spore-forming bacterium found throughout the world. the bacterium mainly affects wild and domesticated herbivores, causing serious, often fatal disease. spores which are the infectant form of the bacteria can remain in soils for decades before being ingested by grazing animals and later on contaminated browse by blow flies  <cit> . consequently, opportunity for accumulating dna mutations is limited, resulting in relatively little genetic variation within the species.

single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most common genetic variation found in genomes of all species. it also represents important biologically informative dna markers extensively used to elucidate deep phylogenetic relationships among worldwide strains, due to their evolutionary stability  <cit> . by querying a large number of them against collections of diverse strains, a set of canonical snps  that define major clades within the b. anthracis species has been identified and used for subdividing all isolates into three major lineages  and  <dig> major sub-lineages or sub-groups  <cit> . other snps that define the a.br.ames and a.br.wna lineages  <cit>  or that lie on various branches of the b. anthracis snp tree  <cit>  have also been published.

as a consequence of the rapid development of technology in the area of high throughput sequencing, extensive genomic sampling is now possible at a reasonable cost. by interrogating nearly every base of the genome, whole genome sequencing is the genotyping tool giving the highest possible resolution, with comparison information spanning from distant phylogenetic relationships to the highest level of subtyping. identification of thousands of snps retrieved from compiled ngs sequences facilitates high-resolution strain tracking and provides the level of discrimination required for microbial forensics. canonical snp typing and whole genome comparisons of multiple strains are now becoming the reference method in b. anthracis genotyping.

in france, anthrax was a widespread cause of disease in livestock and humans until the beginning of the 20th century. the development of live vaccines for animals by louis pasteur , followed by widespread vaccination, had then allowed the numbers of animals affected, and indirectly human cases, to steadily decline. the prevention of new cases and proper carcass disposal with the implementation of knackeries prevented the replenishment of spores in soil in many regions of france and concentrations progressively declined  <cit> . today, anthrax is considered as a sporadic disease that continues to cause occasionally outbreaks in livestock. a few cases with one to several dead animals may be recorded annually. however two large outbreaks with several dozens of animals affected still occurred over the past five years in areas where outbreaks had been reported in the past  <cit> .

we have previously reported the cansnp characterization and mlva typing of a hundreds of strains of b. anthracis isolated in france  <cit> . french strains were assigned into the three b.br.cneva, a.br.011/ <dig> and a.br.001/ <dig> cansnp sub-groups and further resolved into about fifty mlva genotypes . to gain further resolution into the phylogenetic relationships among french isolates,  <dig> strains have been sequenced using parallel sequencing technology. comparative genomics, with a focus on snps discovery, were then conducted to identify diagnostic snps that specifically discriminate regional sub-groups of strains.

RESULTS
cansnp genotyping
one hundred and thirty-six “field strains” representative of anthrax activity in france since about half a century  were selected for this study. all strains were first subjected to cansnp typing  <cit>  to place them into a broader phylogenetic context  <cit> . an additional cansnp assay designed around the a.br. <dig> snp, that further divides the trans-eurasian a.br.008/ <dig> group into two sub-groups   <cit> , was also run against the whole collection . all french a.br.008/ <dig> samples  were defined as belonging to the a.br.011/ <dig> sub-group.

whole genome sequencing
in order to accurately determine the evolutionary relationships among these strains,  <dig> isolates were characterized by paired-end whole genome sequencing. we sequenced  <dig> b.br.cneva-affiliated strains collected in the four areas where this sub-lineage is prevalent , the pyrenees , the massif central region  and the saône-et-loire department ),  <dig> a.br.011/009-affiliated strains isolated throughout the country  and  <dig> of the  <dig> a.br.001/002-affiliated strains collected from the doubs department  and the north-east of france . an african strain  affiliated to the a.br 005/ <dig> sub-group positioned at the basis of the main a radiation was also whole-genome sequenced for comparison.

the illumina sequencers produced  <dig> to  <dig> million reads per strain after applying the quality filter of the illumina base-calling pipeline. the filter-passed reads were aligned to the ames ancestor reference genome, resulting in more than a 56-fold sequencing depth on average and a genome coverage ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> % .

extraction of whole strain-specific snps among b. anthracis strains
comparative analysis of the genomic sequences was next carried out. available data for the b. anthracis ames ancestor, sterne and a <dig> strains were also included. the b. cereus ah <dig> genome was used as outgroup. figure  <dig> illustrates the minimum spanning tree  generated by the chromosomal whole-genome snps data. a total of  <dig> chromosomal snps were discovered that precisely positioned french strains within the b. anthracis snp tree. additional snps  were also identified in both plasmids . consistent with previous mlva and cansnp analyses  <cit> , all french isolates were clustered into three distinct groups, i.e. b.br.cneva, a.br.001/ <dig> and a.br.011/ <dig>  the major b.br.cneva group was separated by a long phylogenetic branch  to the a and c branches radiation. a total of  <dig> snps resolved the french population structure at an unprecedented resolution. strain-specific snps can be defined for nearly all particular strains. moreover, particular genotypes corresponding with geographic regions were observed.

b.br.cneva phylogenetic analysis
more than half of the b. anthracis isolates from france clustered within the b.br.cneva lineage. we therefore focused on further resolving the positions of its members. the b.br.cneva sub-lineage was characterized by  <dig> unique chromosomal snps,  <dig> pxo <dig> snps and  <dig> pxo <dig> snps. our analysis identified  <dig> diagnostic snps that discriminate between french strains, as well as  <dig> plasmidic snps . positions of the  <dig> whole-genome sequenced strains relative to each others are illustrated on figure  <dig>  a geographic clustering into four sub-groups  was observed using both chromosomal and plasmidic snps analysis. four markers that specifically define one of the newly described geographic sub-groups, as well as one additional snp shared by all french b.br.cneva genomes, were selected and incorporated into snp discrimination hrm assays .

a.br.011/ <dig> phylogenetic analysis
comparison of a.br.011/ <dig> genomes yielded a total of  <dig> unique chromosomal snps, including  <dig> snps that resolve the sub-group into six distinct sub-branches without any intermediate nodes . this sub-structure was poorly reflected in both pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> snps profiles. the  <dig> plasmidic snps resolved the  <dig> samples in a higher number of putative branches, without formal clustering . in contrast to the b.br.cneva lineage, a less apparent geographic clustering was also observed within each identified sub-branches . branches  <dig> and  <dig> include strains isolated in the north-east quarter of france, the outermost samples belonging to branch  <dig>  branches  <dig> and  <dig> are composed of strains isolated around the center  and in the south-east quarter of france, respectively. while the only strain of branch  <dig> was isolated close to the pyrenees , the two samples from branch  <dig> are from remote geographical regions . specific snps for the two more relevant branches  were developed into real-time hrm assays .

a.br.001/ <dig> phylogenetic analysis
concerning the minor a.br.001/ <dig> subgroup, sequence analysis identified  <dig> chromosomal snps that differentiate the  <dig> french strains. notably, all isolates from the doubs department  formed a single clonal cluster characterized by  <dig> snps . all strains were closely related, differing by a maximum of  <dig> chromosomal snps. similar snp patterns were found using both virulence plasmids data . most of them  were collected during  <dig> clustered animal outbreaks occurring in the summer of  <dig>  an additional strain was isolated in the same area in  <dig> and presented the dominant 2008's snp genotype, suggesting a common point source for these repeated outbreaks. one snp marker was selected for further testing based upon its specificity for the doubs strains . the three other strains are older “outbreak” samples  isolated in other departments of france. they were found to be unrelated to the doubs recent outbreak isolates. several specific snps differentiating these strains were also found on both plasmids.

french specific snp discrimination genotyping assays
we designed eight novel cansnps discrimination assays based on high-resolution melting -pcr technology . assays targeted five snps identified among the french b.br.cneva genomes, one snp specific to the a.br.001/ <dig> strains isolated in doubs, and two snps defining the two large sub-branches  <dig> and  <dig> of the a.br.011/ <dig> sub-group . these diagnostic assays were then successfully validated across the  <dig> b. anthracis strains of our collection. the two expected alternate alleles exhibited distinct melting curves and melting temperatures , allowing unambiguous grouping of each allele. on average, differences in tm ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> °c were observed between the both allelic states . the seventeen non-sequenced genomes of the collection fall on the correct geographical groups .

tm values are means ± standard deviation calculated from  <dig> strains. mcsl: massif central and saône-et-loire; sl: saône-et-loire; pyr: pyrenees; cne: central north-eastern ; ne: north-eastern.

the eight novel cansnps were further validated in silico against all b. anthracis genomes  available in public ncbi database and sequence read archive   <cit> . the new markers were also screened across a hundred of non-french b. anthracis dnas of diverse origins  to confirm their specificity. the eight assays accurately separated the french strains from the remaining globally diverse genotypes .

discussion
comparative whole-genome sequencing offers a powerful way for in-depth characterization of any bacterial pathogen. it also provides an unbiased approach for informative snps discovery  <cit> . in this study, an ultimate picture of the genetic diversity found within the b. anthracis population in france has been established. an extensive ngs dataset of  <dig> autochthonous strains have been created that allowed the phylogenetic linkage of geographically diverse isolates and the identification of novel snps signatures useful to rapidly determine the geographic origin of any strain ecologically established in france.

within the b.br. cneva lineage, which is the most successful group in frequency found in france, a clustering concordant with the geographical origin of each strain was highlighted. this phylogeography pattern is consistent with a single introduction of this lineage in the country, followed by dispersal of the ancestral population toward west and south, with progressively derived local populations of b. anthracis strains. ecological establishment and in situ differentiation within three regions with environmental conditions particularly favorable for the survival of the spores  are observed: the alps, the pyrenees and the massif central, with further derived sub-clade in sâone-et-loire department . the french b.br.cneva lineage forms a large cluster distinct from similar strains isolated elsewhere in europe . it is worthwhile to mention that a strains are adapted to more diverse environments than b strains, which are restricted to more narrow environmental conditions  <cit> . this trend is reflected on a global scale. a strains have experienced a global dissemination and population explosion, while both b lineages are uncommon in much of the world and appear to be only successful locally or regionally  <cit> .

in contrast to the b.br.cneva lineage, french strains affiliated to both a.br.001/ <dig> and a.br.011/ <dig> groups appeared to be more disparate and less related to one another. several distinct introductions and subsequent in situ differentiation of both cansnp groups in france could therefore not be excluded. one of the more remarkable findings from the whole genome snp analysis was the discovery of a complex pattern of six phylogenetic sub-branches  within the a.br.011/ <dig> isolates collected in france. the tea group  is a cluster that predominates throughout europe, the middle east and the western most chinese province of xinjiang  <cit> . the identification of six sub-branches, with some geographic clustering , indicates an extensive history for the particular a.br.011/ <dig> tea sub-group in france that could be linked to an expansion into many novel environments throughout the country or a combination of possibly repeated introduction and infections. similar pattern of loosely related strains  was also observed for the a.br.001/ <dig> cansnp group, except for strains isolated from the doubs department . all but one of these doubs specimens were isolated from a single episode  associated with the death of  <dig> animals in  <dig>  <cit> . only a short evolutionary time period, i.e. very few snps, separate all doubs isolates, reflecting recurring outbreaks in this specific area. further comparisons with european strains affiliated to the same cansnp groups are, however, need for drawing sound conclusions on the evolution and natural history of both a.br.011/ <dig> and a.br.001/ <dig> cansnp groups in france.

although other relationships are topologically similar to mlva predictions, some discrepancies exist between whole-genome snp- and mlva-based phylogenetic reconstructions . there result from homoplasy coupled with weaker character support in the vntr system. snps are more stable and definitive markers than vntrs. in the mlva- <dig> minimum spanning trees, for example, the french b.br.cneva strains are grouped into three clonal complexes  and a few singletons unrelated to others strains from close geographical origins . most of the strains from the alps, the massif central and part of the saône-et-loire samples were clustered in a single, large clonal complex . strains from the pyrenees formed a distinct clade , as well as half of the saône-et-loire strains . the saône-et-loire isolates were erroneously separated within two different clusters based on difference in up to four vntr loci between cc <dig> and cc <dig>  the discriminative power of the  <dig> vntr markers is also more limited to resolve strains from a specific region or outbreak, as illustrated by the a.br.001/ <dig> strains collected in the doubs  <dig> and  <dig>  while mlva <dig> differentiated five genotypes, nine distinct snps profiles could be resolved by whole-genome snps scanning. furthermore, the latter clearly demonstrated that all doubs strains are genetically related and differs by only one to two snps throughout the whole genomes. snp-based phylogenetic reconstruction of b. anthracis population structure is more reliable. whole genome comparison and cansnps genotyping represent the future of molecular epidemiology analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, an ultimate picture of the genetic diversity found within the b. anthracis population in france has been established. the knowledge derived from this work is extremely useful for future outbreak investigations, not only due to the specific genomic information that facilitates detailed comparisons between different bacterial isolates, but also because the data can be used to add unprecedented resolving power to current molecular typing tools. using hrm, eight novel cansnp assays that narrowly defined the three b. anthracis genetic sub-lineages found in france were developed. as a consequence, whether an index strain is representative of ecologically established strains from france or have been imported from other areas can be rapidly determined.
