BACKGROUND
cotton  is the world’s most important natural fiber. fiber quality is classified based on its physical properties such as length, strength, fineness, and maturity
 <cit> . among these properties, the fiber fineness and maturity are not well defined or understood
 <cit> . the term of fiber fineness has been used to define fiber perimeter, diameter, cross-sectional area, linear density , and specific fiber surface. among them, the linear density is most often used to define fiber fineness by the textile industry. in plant physiological terms, fiber maturity refers to the degree of fiber cell wall thickness
 <cit> . since the fiber maturity and fineness determine the number of cotton fibers in a yarn, they directly affect yarn strength, performance, and dyeing efficiency
 <cit> . cotton fibers with either low or high maturity are classified as low grade for making yarns because less mature fibers with thin cell walls tend to be weak and easily broken during the spinning process, while overly mature fibers with thick cell walls produce coarse and thick yarns that are unfavorable to consumers. to measure fiber maturity and fineness, cell wall area  and perimeter  of multiple fibers need to be measured using the microscopic images from fiber cross-sections
 <cit> . absolute value of fiber maturity defined as circularity  representing the degree of fiber cell wall development is calculated using the equation, θ = 4πa/p <dig> <cit> . despite its superiority for measuring fiber maturity and fineness, microscopic image analysis has not been frequently used due to its long and laborious process. for a quick and automated assessment, fiber fineness and maturity have been indirectly measured as “micronaire”  that is determined by measuring air-flow resistance through a plug of cotton fibers of a given weight. despite the mic value representing a combination of fiber maturity and fineness of cotton fibers, the mic is an effective way of measuring fiber maturity of commercial cotton varieties. thus, textile industry and agricultural marketing services have used the mic values as a key quality assessment parameter of determining the fiber maturity
 <cit> . changes in temperature, water content of soil, and mineral nutrition significantly affect the mic values of cotton fibers: therefore, environmental factors affect mic value of cotton fibers
 <cit> .

when grown under normal environmental conditions, a wild type upland cotton cultivar produces fluffy cotton bolls with mic values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . when grown under severe stress conditions such as drought, cold temperature, or pathogens, the same cultivar produces non-fluffy bolls with mic values less than  <dig> 
 <cit> . in the early 1970s, an immature fiber  mutant that produces non-fluffy bolls with low mic fibers was discovered 
 <cit> . the phenotype of the im mutant grown under normal field conditions resembles that of the wild type plant grown under severe stress
 <cit> . this similarity suggested that the im mutation might be caused by a reduced ability of withstanding stress. previously, we showed that the im gene mutation reduced fiber cell wall thickness, and the im gene located on chromosome 3
 <cit> .

in the current paper we utilize a comparative genomics approach to analyze the im mutant and its near isogenic line  wild type tm- <dig> in order to better understand how the im gene affects fiber cell wall development. our transcriptome results show that the im gene reduces the degree of fiber cell wall thickness by altering the expressions of genes involved in stress responses and cellular respiration.

RESULTS
comparison of im mutant and tm- <dig> wild type fibers
in the cotton field where the two nils were grown side by side under the same environmental conditions, wild type tm- <dig> showed a fluffy fiber phenotype, whereas im mutant had a non-fluffy boll . we manually measured fiber length and maturity from the developing fibers at four different developmental time points that represented the active elongation stage , the transition stage  from elongation to secondary cell wall  biosynthesis stage, the active scw biosynthesis stage , and the maturation stage  . average fiber lengths from developing fibers  of the im mutant were shorter  than the equivalent fibers fromtm- <dig>  tm- <dig> fibers elongated actively at  <dig> dpa  and  <dig> dpa , and reached maximal length at  <dig> dpa . at the same dpas, the average fiber lengths of the im mutant were  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  mm that were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % shorter than those of tm- <dig>  respectively . the final length of developed fibers from the im mutant was similar to that from tm- <dig> .

fiber cell wall thickness between tm- <dig> and im mutant were compared using a microscopic image analysis . at  <dig> dpa, cross-sections of tm- <dig> fibers were circular with thin but detectable secondary cell walls, while im mutant fibers appeared linear due to a lack or very low level of scw cellulose. at  <dig> dpa, fiber cross-sections of both nils were circular but tm- <dig> fibers were thicker than the im fibers. at  <dig> dpa, the fiber cell wall in the im fibers was clearly thinner than that in the tm- <dig> . table 
 <dig> shows the results for the quantitative comparison of the degrees of fiber cell wall thickness  between two nils. these results clearly show that the im mutation greatly affects thickening of the secondary cell wall in both developing and mature fibers.

comparative gene expression analysis of developing fibers from im mutant and tm- <dig> wild type
affymetrix cotton genechip genome arrays were used to identify differentially expressed genes  in developing fibers from tm- <dig> and im mutant. expression levels of transcripts were compared at the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa. among the  <dig>  transcripts contained in an array chip,  <dig> unique transcripts were differentially expressed genes  at all three time points from the im mutant fibers with more than a  <dig> fold difference in transcript abundance compared to tm- <dig> fibers . at all three stages, the number of down-regulated transcripts in the im mutant was more than that of up-regulated transcripts . most of the degs were developmentally-regulated only at one of the specific cotton fiber developmental stages, whereas  <dig> degs were identified at all three stages . among the  <dig> degs,  <dig> degs have a high degree of sequence similarity to known arabidopsis orthologs; these were annotated and further analyzed . an enrichment analysis using biomaps
 <cit>  showed that two biological processes involved in abiotic stimulus response  and cellular respiration  were significantly enriched among the commonly identified degs . of the  <dig> degs,  <dig> degs are predicted to be involved in responses to abiotic or biotic stresses in arabidopsis,  <dig> degs are in metal ion binding or transport, and  <dig> degs are in cellular respiration .

annotation of differentially expressed genes
the expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and pathway was changed substantially in the im mutant . the six transcripts encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  oxidase , a key enzyme producing ethylene hormone and a large number of ap2-erf transcription factors were down-regulated in the developing fibers of the im mutant. in contrast, gibberellin  <dig> oxidase , a key enzyme involved in gibberellins biosynthesis, was highly up-regulated in the im mutant fibers . the expression of transcripts involved in cell wall biosynthesis including xyloglucan endotransglycosylase , pectin  and sucrose synthase  were reduced in the im mutant fibers. in addition to ap2-erfs, a large number of wrky, nac and myb transcription factors involved in stress response and fiber development were also down-regulated in the im mutant . numerous genes known to be involved in the response to abiotic and biotic stress were differentially regulated. moreover, genes involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism known to be regulated by stress were also differentially regulated .

validation of differentially expressed genes
the expression patterns of the degs identified from the im mutant fibers were validated with quantitative real time pcr analysis . differential expressions of  <dig> degs showed in the microarray analysis were validated by rt-qpcr. as shown in figure 
4a, genes involved in stress response were down-regulated in the im mutant fibers. these include the following: the ghnac <dig> transcription factor  previously shown to be differentially regulated in cotton leaves by cold stress and abscisic acid
 <cit> , an unknown nac transcription factor  showing 76% sequence similarity to ghnac <dig> , an ethylene responsive element binding factor  that is a transcription repressor  binding to gcc box or pathogenesis-related promoter element
 <cit> , a hva <dig> protein  known to be induced by abscisic acid and stress in barley aleurone cells
 <cit> , a gibberellic acid  receptor  also known as ga insensitive dwarf <dig>  that restricts plant growth
 <cit> , and a pectin methylesterase  that is an important cell wall enzyme involved in plant tolerance to chilling/freezing by the brassinosteroid hormone pathway
 <cit> . other stress response genes were up-regulated in developing fibers of the im mutant . these include the following genes: alternative oxidase  <dig>  known as a target and regulator of stress responses
 <cit> , toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor nucleotide-binding sites leu-rich repeat  involved in biotic and abiotic stress response
 <cit> , a ga  <dig> oxidase  induced by abiotic stress
 <cit> , allyl alcohol dehydrogenase , cellulose synthase-like protein , and α-expansin  <dig> .

gene ontology analyses of differentially expressed genes
to identify the potential biological processes governing differential expressions of genes in the im mutant fibers, we analyzed the identified  <dig> degs using each of three different gene ontology  term enrichment tools: singular enrichment analysis , parametric analysis of gene set enrichment , and mapman
 <cit> . the go categories identified by the three analyses  were separated into four different classes .

class  <dig>  “stress responding processes”, were commonly identified at  <dig> dpa by all three methods. in addition, the page analysis identified  <dig> degs at  <dig> dpa fibers as genes responding to environmental stimuli.

class  <dig>  “cellular respiration processes”, were identified by all three methods at  <dig> dpa. all identified degs in this class are involved in mitochondrial electron transport and atp synthesis through a classical cytochrome c oxidase  respiratory pathway that generates atp and ros
 <cit> . the class  <dig> and  <dig> identified by sea, mapman, and page were consistent with the results by the biomaps analysis with the  <dig> common degs that were overlapped in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa fibers .

class  <dig>  “cell wall related processes” were identified by sea and page analyses at  <dig> dpa, but not by mapman analysis . sea analysis identified  <dig> degs involved in sucrose metabolic pathways, and page analysis identified  <dig> degs involved in glycosyltranserase activity catalyzing a transfer of a glycosyl or hexosyl group from a udp-sugar .

class  <dig>  “transporting processes” were identified by sea and page analyses. sea analysis identified sodium ion transport  and proton transport , whereas page analysis identified genes involved in zinc and iron binding , and other transition metal ion binding  .

class 1: stress responding processes
the stress responding degs identified by mapman  in  <dig> dpa fibers were further analyzed by scavenger module and imageannotator
 <cit> . these analyses showed that  <dig> degs were abiotic stress related genes, whereas one deg was a biotic stress related gene . of the  <dig> abiotic stress related degs identified,  <dig> degs were predicted to be regulated by heat and  <dig> deg by cold . the one biotic stress related deg was a pr-protein in the downstream portion of the biotic stress pathway, but no other biotic stress related gene was identified in the upstream of the pathway.
 <dig> 

figure 
5b showed a hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> degs identified as genes responding to environmental stimuli from  <dig> dpa fibers by the page analysis. among them, dozens of heat shock proteins, transcripts responding to drought and osmotic adjustment , and flood  were differentially regulated. several alternative oxidases  were also identified in the list .

class 2: cellular respiration process in mitochondria of im mutant
microarray analysis identified  <dig> degs involved in a mitochondrial classical cytochrome c oxidase  respiration pathway producing energy and reactive oxygen species  . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  plant mitochondria possess additional pathways that are mediated by alternative oxidase  and the alternative nad  h dehydrogenases . they enable respiration in the presence of cyanide and rotenone
 <cit> . four degs involved in aox pathway and one deg involved in alternative ndh were identified from the microarray analysis . most genes involved in the cox pathway were down-regulated 3– <dig> fold at  <dig> dpa and a few of them were up-regulated 2– <dig> fold at  <dig> dpa . in contrast, all four aox from alternative pathway were greatly up-regulated during the scw thickening stages . among them, one aox  that was similar to arabidopsis stress responding aox <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> fold by the microarray  and  <dig>  fold by the rt-qpcr assay  at  <dig> dpa in the im fibers. the rotenone insensitive nadh dehydrogenase involved in another alternative respiratory pathway was also up-regulated during the im mutant fiber development .

comparison of differentially regulated genes controlling production of reactive oxygen species from im mutant and tm- <dig> fibers
under stress conditions, aox <dig> was suggested to prevent excess ros formation by bypassing electron transfer from the cox respiratory pathway
 <cit>  . based on the results showing high levels of aox <dig> in the developing fibers of the im mutant, we predicted reduced activity of the cox pathway that generated energy and ros.

to test if the up-regulation of aox <dig> affects the ros production in developing fibers of the im mutant, we measured the levels of superoxide radicals from developing fibers between tm- <dig> and the im mutant. superoxide radicals were detected by semi-quantitatively staining freshly harvested developing fibers  with nbt
 <cit> . the intensity of the purple color was used as a measure of superoxide amounts present in the fibers
 <cit> . lower intensity of purple color in the developing im mutant fibers at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpa than the tm- <dig> fibers suggested a decreased amount of superoxide radicals in the im mutant fibers . the levels of hydrogen peroxide were also quantitatively compared from developing fibers  between tm- <dig> and the im mutant
 <cit> . the content of hydrogen peroxide in developing fibers of tm- <dig> increased as fibers became mature from  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> dpa . at these different stages of fiber development, the hydrogen peroxide content in the im mutant was consistently lower  than that in the tm- <dig> fibers . based on the results of the reduced ros levels along with the elevated levels of aox in the developing fibers of the im mutant, we concluded that the activity of the classical cox respiration pathway generating energy and ros were reduced in developing fibers of the im mutant.

discussion
comprehensive go enrichment analyses identified two common biological processes deregulated in the im mutant
although there are no standard go enrichment analyses established for the cotton transcriptome, go enrichment analyses in other plants are useful and powerful tools for interpretation of the cotton transcriptome data
 <cit> . however, such analyses may identify substantially different annotated genes
 <cit> . to improve the go analyses, we analyzed the transcriptome data using four different methods . the biological processes and the go categories  identified by each analysis were different to some extent, but all four methods identified two common biological processes, i.e., stress responding process  and the cellular respiration process  that were deregulated in the im mutant .

the im gene affects fiber elongation and cell wall development
the im mutant fibers elongated more slowly and had thinner cell walls than the tm- <dig> fibers . the thin cells of the im mutant fibers exhibited less efficient scw biosynthesis. forty five degs identified as being involved in reducing the degree of scw development were down-regulated at the active scw stage in the im mutant fibers . among the  <dig> degs identified, a gene encoding sucrose synthase is one of the main genes involved in scw biosynthesis. several transcriptional factors  involved in the stress-related phytohormones  pathways may be involved in reducing the degree of fiber cell wall development in the im mutant .

we also identified  <dig> candidate genes involved in fiber elongation at  <dig> dpa in the im mutant fibers. they were up-regulated at  <dig> dpa in the im mutant fibers . among them, α-expansin  <dig>  ga and brassinosteroid pathway related genes, and several heat shock proteins might help to continue the elongation of the im mutant fibers at  <dig> dpa . the transcriptome profiles also showed that the degs involved in stress response  and cellular respiration  are commonly identified as being involved in regulating elongation , transition  and scw biosynthesis stages . therefore the deregulation of these genes in the im mutant fibers would be expected to contribute to the mutant phenotype . based on these results, we concluded that the im gene affected both fiber elongation and scw biosynthesis.

the im gene most likely interferes with the ability of the im mutant to respond to stress
all four go enrichment analysis methods commonly identified genes involved in the stress response process  as being deregulated in the im mutant. furthermore, the transcriptome profiles of the im mutant showed significant enrichments of the same degs previously identified as being affected in wild type cotton exposed to drought or salt stress
 <cit> . padmalatha et al.
 <cit>  reported that  <dig>  transcripts  of the total  <dig>  transcripts on the affymetrix chip were regulated by three fold in the drought stressed wild type cotton fibers. yao et al.
 <cit>  reported that  <dig>  transcripts  among the  <dig>  cotton transcripts printed on the affymetrix chip were regulated by two fold differences in the salt stressed wild type cotton roots. when the microarray results from the im mutant fibers are compared with the results from the wild type cottons stressed by drought or salt using a  <dig> fold difference criterion , we found that  <dig> degs  and  <dig> degs  of the  <dig> degs identified in the im mutant fibers overlapped the degs in the drought stressed cotton fibers and the salt stressed cotton roots, respectively . figure 
 <dig> showed that  <dig> degs from the im mutant fibers were common to the drought stressed wild type cotton fibers and salt stressed wild type cotton roots. among these common degs, four acc oxidases for ethylene biosynthesis, two ethylene responsive transcription factors for ethylene signal pathway, and three aoxs for alternative respiration pathway for controlling ros levels were included . these results suggest that the degs identified from the im mutant fibers are involved in some aspect of the control of common stress response pathways
 <cit> .

the im gene is associated with the reduction of reactive oxygen species
further evidence for the im gene being involved in stress response regulation is the fact that the mutant had reduced amounts of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide compared to those in wild type tm- <dig> fibers . ros production mainly occurs during mitochondrial cellular respiration process. the lower ros levels in the im mutant fibers correlate with the finding that an alternative oxidase  involved in the respiration was the most significantly up-regulated in the im mutant fiber . aox was originally identified from a study of thermogenic respiration in arum maculatum and other plants where heat is produced, but no atp is generated
 <cit> . aox was suggested to be an enzyme able to reduce the level of ros that could damage living cells, but which are generated as byproducts during atp production from the classical cox respiration pathway
 <cit> . aox is also known as a “stress-induced protein” since it was induced by both abiotic and biotic stress such as chilling, wounding, drought, osmotic and nutrient stress, and pathogen
 <cit> . in cotton plants, aox was also induced by abiotic stress
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are two classes of aox: aox <dig> and aox2
 <cit> . the expression level of aox <dig> was induced by stress, whereas expression patterns of aox <dig> were tissue specific and developmentally regulated. all four cotton aox genes contained in the microarray chips were up-regulated in developing fibers of the im mutant during fiber development . among them, a cotton aox gene  with 91% sequence similarity to arabidopsis aox1a  and aox1b  was highly up-regulated in the im mutant, whereas the other three cotton aox genes showed high similarity with arabidopsis aox <dig> and were moderately  up-regulated . over-expression of aox <dig> was previously found to decrease ros production whereas a lack of aox in tobacco resulted in high cellular levels of ros
 <cit> . consistent with this suggested function of aox, developing fibers of the im mutant which contained high levels of aox had reduced levels of ros .

the im gene may cause energy deprivation
aox is also suggested to regulate energy balance and metabolic fluctuations in response to abiotic stress
 <cit> . unlike the cox pathway generating atp required for cell growth and maintenance, aox only produces heat without generating atp
 <cit> . thus, energy deprivation in plants is a consequence caused by abiotic stresses reducing the activity of the cox respiratory pathway and activating the aox respiratory pathway in mitochondria. when energy deprivation occurs in plant cells, transcript levels of genes involved in protein synthesis, cell wall biosynthesis, sucrose metabolism, transporters, chromosome and histone modification, and phytohormone signal pathways are changed
 <cit> . the transcriptome profile obtained from developing fibers of im mutant clearly showed the same alteration of transcriptional regulation that happened during energy deprivation . transcript levels of ribosomal proteins responsible for protein synthesis and xet, pectinesterase, pectin methylesterase, and sucrose synthase involved cell wall biosynthesis were all reduced. the class  <dig> including sodium/proton ion transport, and several metal ion binding identified from developing fibers of the im mutant fibers may facilitate recycling processes of the molecules that are degraded from starch and cell walls.

the im gene might be involved in stress sensing, signaling, and responding pathways
the transcriptome profiles from the im mutant fibers and abiotic stressed wild type cotton plants
 <cit>  showed many biotic stress responding genes that were previously classified as defense mechanism related genes or pathogenesis related  genes although they were not affected by treatment of cotton with pathogenic organisms . recent studies have shown that many biotic stress-responding genes were also involved in abiotic stress responses
 <cit> . tir-nbs-lrr, one of the resistant  proteins known to be involved in defense against pathogenic organisms was also reported to be sensitive to temperature changes in arabidopsis <cit> . arabidopsis pathogenesis-related  proteins known as molecular markers for biotic stress caused by pathogens were also involved in response to abiotic stress factors such as light and high concentration of salts
 <cit> . thus, we suspect that the pathogen responsive genes and pr proteins described in table 
 <dig> and figure 
5a were likely to respond to abiotic stress. therefore, we cannot rule out an important contribution to the results from abiotic stress and these might affect the expression levels of the degs identified in the im mutant fibers. abiotic stress from drought, high salinity, and low temperature are well known factors affecting fiber maturity measured as mic value
 <cit> .

like the im mutant fibers in cotton, arabidopsis scw cellulose deficient mutants were reported to have deregulated expressions of stress related genes
 <cit> . the stress related degs identified in the im mutant might be caused by impairments of scw cellulose biosynthesis in the im mutant fibers as found in the arabidopsis cellulose deficient mutants
 <cit> . the im gene might be also involved in sensing or signaling rather than only in controlling the response to stress. similar to a receptor-like kinase  responsible for the sensing cell wall integrity and deregulating defense genes in arabidopsis cellulose deficient mutants
 <cit> , unknown cell wall sensors might involve in sensing the thin cell wall and/or increasing sensitivity to stress in the im mutant fibers. the thin and impaired cell walls of the im mutant fibers might increase the stress effect. phytohormone  signaling pathways related to stress responses might be also involved in reducing the degree of cell wall development in the im mutant fibers.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the results from microarray comparison of the cotton im mutant to a near isogenic wild type, we identified differentially expressed genes in developing fibers of the im mutant that are consistent with the loss of secondary cell wall in the mutant . our results suggest that genes controlling stress responses are affected in the mutant. our data provide evidence that phytohormone signal pathways and their transcription factors controlling these pathways are deregulated in the mutant. some of these genes concomitantly affect cellular respiration, production of defense proteins, and ion transporters. the alternative respiration pathway induced by stress reduced the levels of ros that were originally generated by the classical cox respiration pathway in mitochondria. these up-regulated alternative respirations processes may provide stress adaptation to the im mutant and in turn cause energy deprivation. expression of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, protein synthesis, and sucrose metabolism are reduced. as a result, the im mutant fibers are thin and immature. our analyses suggest that the reduced ability to withstand stress in the im mutant may result in non-fluffy phenotype and the low degree of fiber cell wall thickness. our results provide novel insights on genes involved in the interplay of stress and fiber maturity.
