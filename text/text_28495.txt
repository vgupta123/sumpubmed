BACKGROUND
erα is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors whose activity is primarily regulated by the binding of small lipophilic ligands. estradiol-induced erα signaling is indispensable for many physiological processes including reproductive tissue development , bone metabolism, and immune, cardiovascular, and neurological function. importantly, erα has remained the primary pharmacological target for endocrine therapy of erα positive breast cancer. selective estrogen receptor modulators  such as tamoxifen, as well as estrogen ablation are front line therapies for the treatment of erα-expressing breast neoplasias.

various aspects of erα transcriptional activation are dependent on phosphorylation of the receptor. coactivator recruitment, subcellular localization, receptor dimerization, ligand binding, and posttranslational modifications are regulated through the phosphorylation of individual sites of erα. nine erα phosphorylation sites have been functionally characterized to date: serines  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  in the af- <dig> domain; serine  <dig>  in the dna binding domain; and serines  <dig> , threonine  <dig> , and tyrosine  <dig>  in the af-2/ligand binding domain  . the functional interaction of erα with coregulator proteins such as cbp/p <dig> and the p <dig> family of coactivators is regulated by phosphorylation of erα in the af- <dig> domain  <cit> . s <dig> is phosphorylated in response to both estradiol and epidermal growth factor through cdk <dig> and erk1/ <dig> dependent pathways, respectively  <cit> . phosphorylation of s <dig> in conjunction with s <dig> and s <dig> mediates ligand independent activation of erα by facilitating functional erα interactions with the transcriptional coactivators cbp and src- <dig>  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase  <dig>  can mediate phosphorylation of s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> in vivo and vitro, where s <dig> phosphorylation is dependent on ps <dig>  <cit> . s <dig> of erα is also phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor receptor signaling through p <dig> rsk , thereby significantly enhancing erα transcriptional activity  <cit> . this laboratory demonstrated that src kinase dependent activation of akt resulted in phosphorylation of erα at s <dig> and this site was necessary for src mediated erα transcriptional activity  <cit> . additionally, protein kinase ck <dig> which is upregulated in most proliferating tissues, phosphorylates s <dig> and regulates interaction of erα with estrogen response elements  in vitro  <cit> .

in addition to phosphorylation sites that have been functionally characterized, recent studies have identified novel phosphorylation events at sites s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> by mass spectrophotometry  <cit> . concurrent studies described herein have confirmed s <dig> and s <dig> as bona fide erα phosphorylation sites using phospho-peptide mapping and have ascribed the initial functional significance of these sites to erα transcriptional activity. additionally, antibodies utilized within this study have detected in vivo phosphorylation of s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> in immunohistochemical analysis of human breast carcinoma tissue microarrays  <cit> .

until recently, evidence for a role of erα phosphorylation in breast cancer had been extrapolated from breast cancer cell line models. however, recent studies demonstrate that erα phosphorylation may significantly impact erα signaling in human tissues. immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated s <dig> phosphorylation of erα in breast cancer patient biopsies  <cit> . s <dig> phosphorylation was associated with improved disease free survival despite the ability of s <dig> phosphorylation to mediate ligand independent erα function and association of s <dig> phosphorylation with egfr signaling, a known contributor to tamoxifen resistance in tissue culture models  <cit> . furthermore, s <dig> phosphorylation was directly associated with tamoxifen sensitivity as well as with a more highly differentiated tumor phenotype  <cit> . another study, however, found that erα s <dig> phosphorylation was related to her <dig> expression and tamoxifen resistance upon patient relapse  <cit> . s <dig> phosphorylation has also been correlated to responsiveness to endocrine therapy as well as increased disease free and overall survival in breast cancer patients  <cit> . interestingly, s <dig> is downstream of akt signaling which has been associated with tamoxifen resistance and agonist activity in endometrial cancer cells  <cit> . most recently, it has been reported that low levels of s <dig> phosphorylation accompanied by high levels of s <dig> phosphorylation were associated with increased overall survival and disease-free survival in a study of breast cancer patient biopsies  <cit> . furthermore it was recently suggested that phosphorylation of serine  <dig> in premenopausal women with breast cancer was related to tamoxifen resistance  <cit> . although the number of clinical studies correlating erα phosphorylation and patient prognosis/outcome are relatively few, these studies present the possibility that erα phosphorylation could be predictive of responsiveness to endocrine therapy in erα positive breast cancer.

a number of reports indicate that the most studied of the previously identified erα phosphorylation sites are not the critical targets of signaling pathways that regulate the relative antagonist or agonist properties of tamoxifen. three n-terminal serine phosphorylation sites  in erα were shown to be necessary, but not sufficient for growth factor potentiation of ligand-dependent activation and ligand-independent activation of the erα  <cit> . of significance from these studies was the recognition that at least three othererα serine phosphorylation sites remained to be identified in vivo.

with the expectation that additional erα phosphorylation sites may play a primary role in the modulation of erα function, the present study sought to identify novel erα phosphorylation sites employing in vivo labeling of mammalian cells with h3po <dig>  phosphopeptide mapping and biochemical identification of sites. the present study has identified four novel erα phosphorylation sites in vivo at serine residues s46/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the identification and characterization of these novel erα phosphorylation sites will provide further insight into erα function in both normal and disease states.

RESULTS
identification of serines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as novel erα phosphorylation sites
to identify hitherto unidentified erα phosphorylation sites, the present study employed the same approach used by this laboratory to identify phosphorylation sites in coactivator src- <dig>  <cit> . briefly, cos- <dig> cells expressing erα were labeled in vivo, with h3po <dig> and erα was immunopurified and fractionated by sds-page. a small aliquot was used to confirm purification of erα . following autoradiography of the wet gel, the 67kd band corresponding to erα was excised, subjected to tryptic digestion, and erα tryptic peptides were separated on a c- <dig> reverse-phase hplc column using a 0-45% acetonitrile gradient. radiolabeled peptides were collected and electrophoresed on a 40% alkaline acrylamide gel and autoradiographed to reveal sites of p <dig> incorporation corresponding to erα phosphorylation . subsequently, phosphopeptides were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and modified manual edman degradation to determine the position of each phosphoamino acid within the phosphopeptides. data was obtained for individual phosphopeptides isolated from hplc fractions or alkaline polyacrylamide gels containing each of the four major phosphopeptides labeled a-d in figure 2b. phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that each phosphopeptide contained only phospho-serine . modified manual edman degradation determined the position of p32phosphorylated amino acids within each phosphopeptide as follows: phosphopeptide a, p <dig> release at cycle 5; phosphopeptide b, p32release at cycle 4; phosphopeptide c, p <dig> release at cycle  <dig>  and; phosphopeptide d, p <dig> release at cycle  <dig> . comparison of these results to the predicted tryptic peptides of erα revealed a single candidate phosphopeptide for phosphopeptide a and for phosphopeptide b . the phosphorylation site in phosphopeptide a was identified as serine  <dig> and the site in phosphopeptide b was identified as serine  <dig>  s <dig> phosphorylation has been recently reported by atsriku et al. through maldi-tof mass spectrophotometry in erα + mcf- <dig> cells, thereby validating that s <dig> is a phosphorylation site for erα  <cit> . for phosphopeptide c there were four candidate peptides predicted to have a cycle  <dig> serine release by manual edman degradation . s <dig> was a predicted substrate for ser/pro directed kinases and this sequence is conserved among nuclear receptors . two of the other three candidates for phosphopeptide c were not predicted to be phosphorylation sites according to netphosk phosphorylation prediction models  <cit> . the fourth candidate, s <dig>  was a predicted substrate for pkc but the sequence is not conserved among nuclear receptors. therefore of the four candidate phosphopeptides, s <dig> was the most likely candidate for the phosphorylated residue contained within peptide c. as with s <dig>  s <dig> has recently been confirmed as a erα phosphorylation site by maldi-tof mass spectrophotometry in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . similarly for phosphopeptide d, two possible peptides were predicted to have a cycle  <dig> serine release by manual edman degradation; either s <dig> or s <dig>  s <dig> was contained in an imperfect consensus sequence for pkc whereas s <dig> was not within a predicted kinase recognition sequence .

to distinguish among the candidate peptides for phosphopeptides c and d, and to provide further confirmation of the identity of all phosphorylation sites in phosphopeptides a-d, serine to alanine mutant erα expression constructs were generated at sites s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> . erα mutants were expressed in cos- <dig> cells and p32phosphopeptide maps were prepared and compared to phosphopeptide maps of wild-type  erα . phosphopeptide maps of s294a or s559a resulted in specific loss of phosphopeptides c and b, respectively . the phosphopeptide map of s47a resulted in reduced intensity but not complete loss of phosphopeptide d . a close examination of the first tryptic cleavage site directly c-terminal to s <dig> revealed a lysine-proline sequence at residues 48- <dig>  trypsin cleaves inefficiently at r/k-proline sequences making it possible that phosphopeptide d was the result of an incomplete tryptic digest  <cit> . the next trypsin cleavage site following an incomplete digest at k <dig> occurs at residue r <dig> and digestion at this site would result in a very large phosphopeptide of  <dig> amino acids. the possibility of an incomplete tryptic digest at k <dig> was consistent with the relative migration of phosphopeptide d at the top of the alkaline acrylamide gel, and the elution of this phosphopeptide in the later fractions from the c <dig> reversed phase column . since the previously identified erα phosphorylation sites s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> would also be present in the very large phosphopeptide resulting from incomplete digestion of k <dig>  an erα expression plasmid was constructed containing four serine-to-alanine mutations at s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> and a phosphopeptide map of this protein was prepared. as shown in figure 3e, s47a/s104a/s106a/s118a resulted in complete loss of phosphopeptide d consistent with the interpretation that all four phosphorylation sites s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> were present in phosphopeptide d. additionally, it was noted that phosphopeptide c was diminished upon mutation of s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  suggesting that s <dig> phosphorylation, or a site within a peptide which co-migrates electrophoretically with peptide c may be dependent upon phosphorylation of one or several sites within the d peptide .

despite multiple attempts, phosphopeptide maps of s282a consistently resulted in a very weak steady state erα phosphorylation profile. this was likely the result of estradiol induced loss of s282a protein after  <dig> hours . this effect was time dependent since estradiol did not reduce s282a protein after  <dig> hours incubation. the destabilization of erα by mutation of s282a is currently under investigation. the effect of phosphorylation site mutation on phosphorylation at other sites is also under investigation.

phospho-specific antibodies recognize erα phosphorylated at serines  <dig>   <dig>  and 559
to further verify the authenticity of the phosphorylation sites identified by the biochemical approaches above and to study the impact of erα phosphorylation at s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  phospho-specific antibodies to each site were generated. immunogens  were designed and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against each phosphorylation site as previously described by this laboratory  <cit> . to validate the phospho-specific antibodies, s47a, s282a, s294a or s559a were expressed in cos- <dig> cells and lysates were subjected to western immunoblotting with total erα antibody and with phospho-specific antibodies to each site . each point mutation was expressed at comparable levels to wt erα. each phospho-specific antibody recognized wt erα but the phospho-specific antibodies to sites s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> did not recognize the corresponding mutations s282a, s294a, and s559a confirming that phosphorylation at these sites was necessary for the immuno-reactivity. in contrast, mutation s47a was still recognized by the phospho-antibody to ps <dig>  of interest was the decreased electrophoretic mobility of erα upon mutation of s <dig> to alanine . this reduced mobility may be indicative of further post-translational modifications that are regulated by s <dig> phosphorylation similar to what has been observed for s305a mutations .

to further validate the specificity of the erα phospho-specific antibodies, baculovirus expressed recombinant erα was incubated with and without λ-phosphatase followed by western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. each antibody was determined to be phosphorylation state specific as evidenced by the lack of immunoreactivity following incubation with λ-phosphatase .

the results for α-ps <dig> were inconclusive since mutation of this residue failed to inhibit immunoreactivity, yet dephosphorylation by λ phosphatase indeed decreased immunoreactivity . these findings lend evidence to the existence of an alternative phosphorylation site within the region corresponding to the immunogenic peptide used to generate the ps <dig> antibody. it was therefore investigated whether phosphorylation of the adjacent serine  <dig>  was responsible for the immunoreactivity of the α-p-s <dig> antibody. results indicate that mutation to alanine of either s <dig>  s <dig> or s46/s <dig> did not block immunoreactivity of the p-s <dig> antibody to erα  indicating that the α-p-s <dig> antibody was not specific for the western blotting procedure. as such, the α-ps <dig> antibody was not used for subsequent studies. it is possible this antibody may demonstrate specificity in other procedures  and this is currently being investigated.

endogenously expressed erα is phosphorylated at s <dig>  s <dig>  and s559
to determine whether endogenously expressed erα was phosphorylated at sites s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  erα was first immunoprecipitated using phosphospecific antibodies directed towards p-s <dig>  p-s <dig>  and p-s <dig>  followed by western blotting with antibody to total erα in a panel of erα+ breast cancer cell lines. using this approach, phosphorylation at each site was detected in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells and mcf-7-lcc <dig> cells, a tamoxifen resistant derivative of mcf- <dig>  <cit> . erα+ ishikawa endometrial adenocarcinoma cells did not exhibit substantial phosphorylation at s <dig>  and weak immunoreactivity for s <dig> and s <dig> phosphorylation observed. these studies indicate that erα is phosphorylated at serines s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> in endogenous erα expressing breast and endometrial cancer cells. it should be noted that phosphospecific antibodies for p-s <dig>  p-s <dig>  and p-s <dig> also detected phosphorylated erα in erα positive human breast carcinomas  <cit> .

to determine if the phosphorylation of er at s <dig>  s <dig>  or s <dig> was regulated by estradiol, mcf <dig> cells were incubated for  <dig> minutes with 10- <dig> m estradiol. estradiol markedly increased phosphorylation at sites s <dig> and s <dig> but had little effect on s <dig> . these data further demonstrate that phosphorylation of erα at s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> comprise an integral component of endogenous erα signaling.

erα phosphorylation at novel sites impacts erα regulated gene expression
to determine the role of erα phosphorylation in receptor mediated transcription, erα negative  hela cervical cancer cells were cotransfected with individual erα phospho mutant expression plasmids and a reporter plasmid  containing two canonical ere sequences. mutation of a serine residue to non-phosphorylatable alanine mimics loss of a phosphorylation site. s282a and s559a exhibited a significant increase in basal reporter activity compared to wt erα but these mutants exhibited no statistical difference compared to wt erα in estradiol-dependent reporter activation . s294a exhibited reduced estradiol-dependent reporter activation. s47a mutants showed a trend toward increased basal and ligand dependent activation in reporter assays, but did not reach statistical significance. these data suggest that phosphorylation at sites s <dig> and s <dig> inhibit ligand-independent activation of erα, and that phosphorylation at s <dig> is required for full estradiol activation of gene transcription.

real time rt-pcr was used to measure expression of the endogenous estrogen responsive gene ps <dig> in hela cells transiently transfected with wt erα or mutant erα expression plasmids. the ps <dig> promoter contains separate ere and ap- <dig> sites  <cit> . most intriguing and consistent with the reporter gene results in figure 5a, expression of s559a resulted in significantly elevated ligand independent activation of ps <dig> . similarly, s282a also resulted in elevated ligand independent activation of ps <dig>  s47a exhibited significant repression of estradiol-induced ps <dig> expression, which was in contrast to what was observed with the reporter gene assay. s294a exhibited no change in either basal or estradiol induced ps <dig> expression compared to wt erα. the differential effects observed with regard to s47a and s294a regulation of ps <dig> versus the ere2-tk-luciferase reporter gene likely reflect gene specific effects for erα phosphorylation. interestingly, the ere of the ps <dig> gene works in synergy with an adjacent ap- <dig> site to mediate estradiol induced ps <dig> expression  <cit> . figure 5c demonstrates that an equivalent level of erα protein was detected for wt erα and the mutants.

one limitation of erα cells such as hela to study ps <dig> or other endogenous gene expression, is that these cells do not express ps <dig> and cells transiently transfected with erα expression plasmids likely produce low levels of ps <dig> protein following estradiol treatment due to limitations of the transient transfection approach. future studies will directly mutate erα phosphorylation sites of the endogenous esr- <dig> gene in cells that robustly express erα to overcome the limitations of transient transfection employed here.

although biochemical identification and site directed mutagenesis identified s <dig> as a novel phosphorylation site in phosphopeptide d, the α-ps <dig> phosphospecific antibody retained immunoreactivity with s47a. since λ phosphatase resulted in loss of immunoreactivity of α-ps <dig> antibody the possibility was raised that the adjacent serine, s <dig>  might be phosphorylated in the s47a mutant. netphosk software revealed that s <dig> forms a putative recognition sequence for protein kinase c classic isoforms that more closely resembles a canonical recognition motif for pkc classical isoforms than does s <dig>  to investigate the possibility that s <dig> phosphorylation could be an alternative phosphorylation site for s <dig> of erα, serine to alanine mutations were introduced at s <dig> and/or s <dig> . erα hela cervical cancer cells were cotransfected with s46a, s47a, or s46/47a expression plasmids and ere2-tk-luciferase reporter plasmid. results indicated that mutation of s <dig>  but not s <dig>  significantly suppressed erα transcriptional function . the 46/47a mutant displayed similar activity to s46a, suggesting that the predominant effect on transcriptional activity was through s <dig> phosphorylation.

protein kinase ck <dig> phosphorylates erα s <dig> and s <dig> in vitro and in vivo
motif analysis revealed that each phosphorylation site was contained within known kinase recognition motifs . s46/ <dig> was present within an imperfect recognition motif for classical pkc isoforms . s <dig> and s <dig> were present within a consensus sequence for protein kinase ck <dig> phosphorylation . s <dig> was present within a putative recognition motif for ser/pro directed kinases. in vitro phosphorylation of baculovirus expressed human erα was performed with erk1/ <dig> , and protein kinase ck2α catalytic subunit  followed by western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies. in vitro kinase assays with erk1/ <dig> did not result in phosphorylation at s <dig> . incubation of erα with protein kinase ck <dig> resulted in phosphorylation of s <dig> and s <dig> in vitro . these findings are of significant interest with regard to ck <dig> overexpression documented in various cancers, including breast cancer  <cit> .

to demonstrate the involvement of ck <dig> in the phosphorylation of erα at s <dig> and s <dig> in vivo, mcf <dig> cells were incubated with the highly selective ck <dig> inhibitor, dmat  for  <dig> hour, prior to incubation with e <dig> for  <dig> minutes. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-ps <dig> and α-ps <dig> antibodies, and subsequently western blots using antibody to total erα protein. dmat suppressed phosphorylation of s <dig> and s <dig> further indicating that ck <dig> is responsible for the phosphorylation of both s <dig> and s <dig> of erα .

discussion
the present study has characterized four novel phosphorylation sites in human erα in vivo. two of these sites, s <dig> and s <dig>  have been independently confirmed by mass spectrophotometry in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . additionally, collaborators at the university of manitoba recently found that erα is phosphorylated at s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> in human breast carcinoma biopsies, lending evidence to the physiological relevance of these sites in the breast cancer  <cit> . s <dig> phosphorylation is the first phosphorylation site identified in the extreme c-terminal  of a steroid nuclear receptor  <cit> . generation of phospho-specific erα antibodies provided the tools to validate phosphorylation sites and to begin to assess the functional significance of these specific sites. accordingly, these phospho-specific antibodies were used to detect phosphorylation of each residue by western blot/immunoprecipitation from cells that expressed endogenous erα . phosphorylation at s46/ <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> each had an impact on erα mediated activation of reporter gene ere2-tk-luciferase and/or endogenous ps <dig> gene expression . two of these sites, s <dig> and s <dig>  were contained within consensus sequences for protein kinase ck <dig> and were phosphorylated by ck <dig> in vitro and in vivo . in particular, phosphorylation changes at the f domain s <dig> site had profound effects on ligand independent activation of erα. these findings provide valuable insight into the regulation of ligand dependent and ligand independent erα function. furthermore, pharmacological targeting of the cell signaling pathways that regulate erα phosphorylation at these sites may represent therapeutic targets for modulating erα function.

s <dig>  located in the f-domain of erα, represents a very intriguing phosphorylation site because mutation to alanine enhances ligand independent activation of erα . studies have demonstrated that the f-domain of various nuclear receptors may be responsible for interaction with coregulators, and for determining the relative agonist/antagonist character of several erα ligands  <cit> . at least two groups have demonstrated that f-domain deletions, that included deletion of a regions containing s <dig>  enhanced transcriptional activity of erα  <cit> . furthermore, src- <dig> association with erα was increased upon deletion of the f domain  <cit> . another report demonstrated that the intact erα f-domain inhibited the association of unliganded er with rea  using in vitro gst pull down assays  <cit> . these studies indicate that the f-domain of erα was responsible for the inhibition of erα association with both coactivators  and corepressors . although these findings do not directly implicate a central role for s <dig> phosphorylation in coregulator recruitment, it does highlight the importance of the f-domain in erα/coregulator interactions. interestingly, another report suggested that point mutations of s <dig> and e <dig> to alanine disrupted a predicted helix in the f-domain that resulted in a slight inhibition of ligand independent transcriptional activity and an enhanced estradiol-activation of erα mediated gene expression  <cit> .

the phosphorylation of s <dig> and s <dig> may also be important for regulating erα function. the location of s <dig> and s <dig> in the hinge region near the dbd is suggestive of a role for these phosphorylation sites in dna binding and/or dimerization of erα. the present data, however suggest that phosphorylation of these residues lead to opposing effects on erα mediated transcription . reporter gene data suggest that phosphorylation at s <dig>  much like s <dig>  was involved in the suppression of unliganded erα activity. however, mutation of s <dig> also resulted in increased estradiol-dependent loss of er protein. as such, the impact of s <dig> phosphorylation may be biphasic. in the transient setting, s <dig> phosphorylation may result in attenuated transcriptional activity but may lend to long term stabilization of er protein levels allowing transcriptional activity to persist over time. s <dig> mutation to alanine resulted in a suppressive effect in reporter assays but not in expression of the endogenous estrogen regulated gene ps <dig>  one likely explanation is that the complexity of the endogenous ps <dig> promoter allows other transcription factors/transcriptional regulators to compensate for loss of erα function caused by mutation of s <dig> to alanine. the ps <dig> promoter does indeed contain an ap- <dig> site that is thought to act in concert with the ere to mediate transcriptional activity. in this setting, slight changes in ere mediated transcriptional function may be compensated with the ap- <dig> site.

s46/ <dig> phosphorylation may play a role in the ligand dependent activation of erα. data suggested that s <dig>  and not s <dig>  is responsible for regulating erα transcriptional activity. s <dig> which was identified by biochemical means, may be phosphorylated due to a "bystander effect" in which kinases,  are directed to the s <dig> site but may phosphorylate both the s <dig> and the weaker recognition site, s <dig>  alternatively, s <dig> and s <dig> phosphorylation events could be distinct events. indeed, s <dig> lies within an imperfect protein kinase c recognition motif as does s <dig> and mutation of s <dig> results in substantial inhibition of ere-luciferase activity in hela cells but was not identified biochemically as an erα phosphorylation site. interestingly, mutation of s <dig> or s46/ <dig> does not lead to the electrophoretic up shift observed upon mutation of s <dig> alone suggesting that these sites play distinct roles in er transcriptional regulation. these data can only be suggestive of s <dig> phosphorylation as there has been no direct biochemical evidence that s <dig> is phosphorylated. as with the other four a/b region phosphorylation sites , s <dig> may contribute to the ligand independent and ligand dependent function of the receptor. in agreement with this assertion it has been demonstrated that murine erα transcriptional activity is induced by pkcδ through the af- <dig> domain and that pkcδ activity leads to phosphorylation of mouse erα  <cit> . nonspecificity of the α-ps <dig> antibody precluded further experiments that would have been necessary to determine if pkc is indeed necessary for the phosphorylation of s46/ <dig> and if this mediates the transcriptional induction of erα through the pkc pathway.

the finding that s <dig> and s <dig> were phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by protein kinase ck <dig> indicates a central role for ck <dig> in the regulation of erα transcriptional activity . previous studies indicate that ck <dig> enhances erα dna binding in vitro and that ck <dig> phosphorylates erα at serine  <dig>  <cit> . previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that mutation of s <dig> to alanine markedly reduced erα transcriptional activity and disrupted erα interaction with endogenous promoters  <cit> . s <dig> and s <dig> represent the second and third sites of erα regulation by ck <dig>  remarkably, mutation of s <dig> or s <dig> to alanine resulted in near opposite functional effects on erα as compared to mutation of s <dig> to alanine. erα ligand independent transcriptional activity was markedly enhanced upon mutation of s <dig> and s <dig> to alanine whereas estradiol mediated activation remained equivalent to wt erα . these findings suggested that ck <dig> phosphorylation maintains erα in a state in which basal ligand independent activity is suppressed while responsiveness to ligand is retained. this is significant in that ck <dig> overexpression has been observed in several cancers including breast cancer  <cit> . it has also recently been demonstrated that several tamoxifen resistant breast cancer cell lines showed greater susceptibility to apoptosis upon inhibition of ck <dig> compared to tamoxifen sensitive mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . additionally, developmental mouse models reveal a causative role for ck <dig> in breast cancer in which mmtv-ck2α transgenic mice form mammary tumors at a frequency of 35% as compared to > 1% in wt fvb mice  <cit> . therefore, the signaling axis of erα and ck <dig> in breast cancer is of great interest and provides a putative target for therapeutic intervention.

the signaling axis between ck <dig> activity and erα transcriptional regulation has yet to be elucidated. though mutagenesis of sites demonstrated that absence of a phosphorylation event at s <dig> and s <dig> positively regulated er transcriptional activity, inhibition of ck <dig> by dmat inhibited er transcriptional activity . one possibility to explain these findings is that ck <dig> may be necessary for the activity of transcriptional coregulators involved in er signaling. a second explanation may be that er is phosphorylated by ck <dig> at additional sites .

sequence alignment analysis  was used to determine conservation of phosphorylation at s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> among other nuclear receptors. s <dig>  which lies in the highly heterologous and heavily phosphorylated af- <dig> region of erα, was difficult to align with af- <dig> regions of other nuclear receptors and consequently it was difficult to assess conservation of this site among receptors. however because there is more homology within the dbd, hinge and lbd regions of nuclear receptors, phosphorylation at sites equivalent to s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> may be more highly conserved among nuclear receptors. the har  is phosphorylated by stress kinases  within the har hinge region , a site that is homologous to and aligns closely with s <dig> of erα  <cit> . interestingly, the ptee sequence encompassing s <dig> comprises a putative ck <dig> recognition motif as does s <dig>  suggesting some conservation in phosphorylation between erα and har. functionally, s <dig> phosphorylation of the har is suggested to regulate nuclear export  <cit> . the hpr-b  is phosphorylated in the hinge region by cdk <dig> at s <dig>  <cit> . however s <dig> phosphorylation has not been ascribed mechanistic relevance in hpr-b function and this site does not align closely with erα s <dig> or har s <dig> in alignment analysis. it is possible however, that phosphorylation of hpr-b at s <dig> is homologous to erα s <dig>  s <dig> is likely targeted by serine-proline  directed kinases and is located within the hinge domain of erα. regarding s <dig> phosphorylation, to date no phosphorylation site has been identified in the f domain of steroid receptors  <cit> .

motif analysis identified kinase recognition sequences in other nuclear receptors that may be analogous to ck <dig> phosphorylation of s <dig> and s <dig>  erβ has putative ck <dig> recognition sites at s <dig>  and s <dig> . s <dig> of rxrα  is contained within a putative ck <dig> site  that aligns with, and may be homologous to, s <dig> of erα. the relatively high number of putative ck <dig> phosphorylation sites within nuclear receptors may indicate that ck <dig> phosphorylation is intrinsically linked to cell cycle progression given that ck <dig> expression and activity is increased in highly proliferating tissues  <cit> .

these studies represent the first characterization of four newly identified phosphorylation sites within erα. one caveat to these findings is the use of erα  hela cells to determine the impact of each phosphorylation site on erα transcriptional activity. hela cells only weakly support af- <dig> activity of erα. as such, these studies may represent mechanisms that are primarily representative of af- <dig> regulation. indeed, three of the four identified phosphorylation sites lie outside of the af <dig> domain suggesting that these sites may function independently of af- <dig>  however this does not preclude phosphorylation dependent interaction between af- <dig> and af- <dig> domains. despite these limitations, hela cells support erα transcriptional activity in luciferase reporters and demonstrate the regulation of endogenous estradiol regulated genes. additionally, because the cells are erα , the influence of endogenous erα expression on estradiol-mediated gene transcription is not present.

CONCLUSIONS
the study presented herein describes the initial identification and/or functional characterization of s46/ <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> as phosphorylation sites within erα. these studies show that phosphorylation at s46/ <dig> or at s <dig> likely potentiate erα transcriptional activity whereas s <dig> and s <dig> phosphorylation are likely to negatively regulate erα transcriptional activity as evidence by mutational analysis. additionally, this study identified protein kinase ck <dig> as the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of erα at s <dig> and s <dig>  the identification and characterization of phosphorylation at s46/ <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> provides additional insight into regulation of erα signaling. ultimately, the impact of erα phosphorylation at these sites will provide new diagnostic tools in breast cancer and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to target erα signaling.
