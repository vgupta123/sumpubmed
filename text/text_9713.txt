BACKGROUND
the pim- <dig> proto-oncogene was first identified as a common proviral insertion site associated with murine leukemiavirus-induced lymphomagenesis, and its oncogenic activity was verified with transgenic mice overexpressing pim- <dig> in the lymphoid compartment  <cit> . these mice show a low incidence of spontaneous t-cell lymphomas, the development of which can be accelerated by activation of cooperating oncogenes, such as myc family genes, bcl- <dig> or runx <dig>  <cit> . two additional, functionally redundant pim family members have been identified with partially overlapping expression patterns. the murine pim- <dig> gene encodes  <dig> and  <dig> kd isoforms of a serine/threonine-specific kinase  <cit> , whose expression in hematopoietic cells can be induced by a variety of cytokines, such as interleukins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and interferon-α  <cit> . we and others have shown that pim- <dig> is involved in cytokine-dependent signaling via its ability to regulate activities of the nfatc  <cit>  and c-myb  <cit>  transcription factors, the epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen- <dig>  <cit>  and the socs family suppressors of cytokine signaling  <cit> . pim kinases also enhance hematopoietic cell survival and participate in regulation of the cell cycle  <cit> .

runx family proteins   <cit>  are dna-binding α-subunits of heterodimeric transcription factors that are essential for both cell proliferation and differentiation during development  <cit> . homozygous disruption of murine runx <dig> results in complete lack of bone formation, runx <dig> knockout mice are embryonally lethal due to failure of definitive hematopoiesis, and runx3-deficient mice display abnormal development of gastric epithelium and dorsal root ganglion as well as defects in thymopoiesis. in addition, strict spatiotemporal expression of all runx family genes is critical for normal hematopoiesis  <cit> . the runx proteins contain an evolutionary conserved region, the runt domain, which has been named after their structural homologue in drosophila  <cit> . this region is required for dna-binding as well as for dimerization with the β-subunit. while three mammalian genes encode α-subunits: runx <dig> , runx <dig>  and runx <dig> , only one gene has been identified for the β-subunit . the β-subunit can enhance dna-binding by the runt domain but does not contact dna itself  <cit> . there is less sequence similarity between runx family members outside the runt domain, except for the highly conserved five amino acid c-terminus  known to bind transcriptional repressors, but the c-terminal regions are rich in proline, threonine and serine  and contain domains involved in transcriptional activation or inhibition  <cit> . runx activity has recently been shown to be regulated by several extracellular signaling pathways resulting in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination.  <cit> .

the involvement of runx genes in cancer was first discovered as chromosomal translocations associated with acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> . these translocations had resulted in fusion proteins lacking the c-terminal transactivation domains of runx <dig>  evidence for runx <dig> function as a tumor suppressor gene was obtained from knock-in mice where a single runx1-eto fusion allele caused a similar phenotype as observed for the runx <dig> null mice  <cit> . human runx <dig> has also been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in gastric carcinomas  <cit> . however, recent retroviral tagging studies have indicated that any of the three murine runx genes can also operate as dominant oncogenes that can co-operate with myc and pim family genes in lymphomagenesis  <cit> . human runx genes have also been observed to be amplified in childhood leukemias  <cit> .

here we show that the pim- <dig> kinase can physically interact with runx family transcription factors, colocalize with them within nuclei and phosphorylate them in vitro. furthermore, the transactivation ability of runx <dig> is potentiated by pim- <dig>  suggesting a mechanism via which pim- <dig> may regulate the activity of runx family transcription factors during hematopoiesis as well as in leukemogenesis.

RESULTS
pim- <dig> interacts with runx family proteins
to search for putative pim-1-interacting partners, we used the yeast two-hybrid system as previously described  <cit> . a kinase-deficient k67m mutant of pim- <dig> fused to the lexa dna-binding domain was used as a bait to screen a library of cdna clones that had been isolated from epstein-barr virus-transformed human lymphocytes and fused to the vp <dig> activation domain. out of the approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> yeast transformants tested,  <dig> clones were recovered that were able to activate two separate reporter genes in a strictly pim-1-dependent fashion.

sequence analysis revealed that one of the strongly interacting cdna clones, designated b <dig>  encoded amino acids 264– <dig> of the human runx <dig> protein, including its c-terminal transactivation and inhibition domains, but lacking the most c-terminal end . to test whether this fragment interacted also with the wild-type pim- <dig> protein, a mating assay was carried out using a modified two-hybrid assay  <cit>  with baits fused to the gal <dig> dna-binding domain. results from this assay indicated that the vp16-b <dig> fusion protein interacts equally well with both the wild-type and mutant gal4-pim- <dig> fusion proteins, but not with any control proteins tested, such as lamin or the src kinase, as judged by the ability of the diploid yeast strains to grow on selective medium lacking histidine . the bait proteins did not activate the reporter genes on their own in the absence of the b <dig> fragment, while all strains were able to grow on non-selective medium containing histidine . the physical interaction observed in vivo in yeast cells was also biochemically confirmed in a gst pull-down assay, where bacterially produced gst-b <dig> fusion protein was specifically able to associate with in vitro translated 35s-labeled pim- <dig> protein .

to further examine the interaction between pim- <dig> and full-length runx transcription factors within living cells, cos- <dig> cells were transiently transfected with vectors expressing pim- <dig> and either myc-tagged runx <dig>  runx <dig> or flag-tagged runx <dig>  two days later, cells were collected and lysed, after which the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc or flag antibodies followed by western blotting with anti-pim- <dig> antibody. this analysis revealed that pim- <dig> can be coprecipitated together with both runx <dig> and runx <dig> full-length proteins .

pim- <dig> colocalizes with runx <dig> and runx <dig> proteins in nucleus
to be able to investigate the intracellular distribution and possible colocalization of pim- <dig> and runx proteins, cos- <dig> cells were transiently transfected with vectors expressing pim- <dig> fused to the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein  and either runx <dig> or runx <dig> fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein . as expected from previous studies with untagged proteins  <cit> , pim- <dig> protein was found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of interphase cells, while runx <dig> and runx <dig> proteins predominantly localized to the nuclei in a granular expression pattern . more intriguingly, both runx <dig> and runx <dig> colocalized with pim- <dig> in the nuclei of double-positive cells, as demonstrated by scattergram analysis of merged fluorescent images from fixed as well as from living cells . altogether, our immunoprecipitation and imaging results indicated that pim- <dig> can colocalize and physically interact with runx family proteins within the nuclear compartment.

pim- <dig> can phosphorylate runx <dig> and runx <dig> proteins in vitro
to find out whether human or murine runx proteins act as substrates for the pim- <dig> kinase, in vitro kinase assays were carried out with bacterially expressed proteins fused to the glutathione s-transferase  protein. wild-type gst-pim- <dig>  but not the corresponding kinase-deficient k67m mutant was able to phosphorylate itself, the c-terminal interacting fragment of human runx <dig> as well as the full-length murine runx <dig> protein, but not the gst moiety . pim- <dig> phosphorylated also several c-terminal fragments of murine runx <dig> . since not all the runx <dig> and runx <dig> fragments overlapped with each other , this suggests that there are multiple target sites for pim- <dig> within the runx proteins.

pim- <dig> potentiates transcriptional activity of the runx <dig> transcription factor
phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase  has previously been shown to potentiate the transactivation ability of runx <dig>  <cit> . to investigate whether phosphorylation of runx <dig> by pim- <dig> had similar consequences, transient transactivation experiments were carried out in jurkat t cells using a previously established luciferase reporter assay with which the functional domains of runx <dig> had been determined  <cit> . there the luciferase gene is driven by the macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor  promoter containing binding sites for runx, pu. <dig> and c/ebp transcription factors. in jurkat t cells, the reporter is inactive in the absence of ectopic expression of any runx family member and their heterodimeric binding partner cbfβ, while runx <dig> alone only slightly activates it. also in our assays, ectopic expression of pim- <dig> was unable to stimulate luciferase activity in the absence of runx <dig> . as shown in figure 4a, increasing amounts of wild-type pim- <dig> were able to enhance runx1/cbfβ-dependent transactivation of the luciferase reporter in a statistically significant and dose-dependent fashion, as also confirmed by analysis of the steady-state levels of pim- <dig> protein by western blotting. by contrast, the kinase-deficient k67m mutant of pim- <dig> did not have any major effects on runx <dig> activity, while the more extensive nt <dig> mutant lacking the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of pim- <dig> even slightly inhibited it . we have previously shown that this mutant can act in a dominant negative fashion to downregulate the effects of the endogenously expressed wild-type pim- <dig> protein e.g. on nfatc activity  <cit> .

to examine whether the effects of pim- <dig> were mediated via the activation domain of runx <dig> that pim- <dig> was able to phosphorylate, additional assays were carried out with a gal4-dependent luciferase reporter coexpressed with a fusion protein where the yeast gal <dig> dna-binding domain had been fused with the activation domain of runx <dig>  containing two major transactivation elements, te <dig> and te <dig> . indeed, wild-type pim- <dig> was able to increase luciferase activity when coexpressed with the gal4-runx <dig> fusion protein, but not with the gal <dig> dna-binding domain alone . since the kinase-deficient mutants remained inactive in this assay , our results suggest that the effects of pim- <dig> are dependent on the presence of its phosphorylation target sites within the activation domain of runx proteins.

ser <dig> and ser <dig> of runx <dig> have been shown to be targeted by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase   <cit> . more recent studies have indicated that phosphorylation by erk affects not only activity, but also localization and stability of runx <dig>  <cit> . unphosphorylated runx <dig> interacts with the transcriptional repressor msin3a and is associated with nuclear matrix. phosphorylation of runx <dig> by the erk-dependent pathway releases runx <dig> from msin3a and nuclear matrix, and this is accompanied with enhanced transcriptional activity. however, since binding to msin3a protects runx <dig> from proteosome-mediated degradation, corepressor release from runx <dig> may regulate its transcriptional activity in a time-dependent fashion, and thereby prevent prolonged runx <dig> activation in response to cytokines or growth factors. since none of the amino acid sequences surrounding erk-phosphorylated or other c-terminal serine or threonine residues in runx <dig> show obvious homology to the reported lys/arg-rich pim- <dig> consensus phosphorylation site  <cit> , the pim- <dig> target sites as well as the putative effects of the pim- <dig> kinase on stability of runx proteins remain to be identified.

pim- <dig> may regulate hematopoietic cell fate together with runx proteins
enforced expression of runx <dig> and gfi- <dig> transcription factors in murine thymocytes has been shown to result in delayed thymocyte development at the stage of β-selection where cells rearrange their t cell receptor β  locus  <cit> . interestingly, pim- <dig> is able to promote maturation of double negative  thymocytes into double positive  thymocytes in rag-deficient and tcrβ enhancer-deleted mice, which are deficient in β-selection as are also mice overexpressing gfi- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, intact runx <dig> protein is required for cell proliferation during dn-to-dp transition  <cit> . thus, strict spatio-temporal expression of all these proteins is important for development of dn thymocytes into more mature dp t cells and further into functional mature single positive effector t cells.

both pim and runx family genes can cooperate with myc family genes in tumor formation  <cit> , which correlates well with the observation that both runx <dig> and runx <dig> were found among the genes that could substitute for pim- <dig> and pim- <dig> in retroviral tagging experiments  <cit> . however, pim- <dig> and runx <dig> have also been shown to cooperate with each other  <cit> , suggesting that these genes are not completely redundant in their oncogenic effects and that runx family transcription factors may function both in parallel as well as downstream of pim kinase-modulated pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that the pim- <dig> serine/threonine kinase is able to physically interact with the runx family transcription factors, colocalize with them within nuclei and phosphorylate them in vitro. moreover, the transcriptional activity of at least runx <dig>  but most likely also of other runx family members is potentiated by pim- <dig>  these results have revealed a previously unrecognized signaling cascade involving pim- <dig> kinase and the runx family of transcription factors that may control differentiation and transformation of hematopoietic cells.
