BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  are a pivotal part of the immune system, bridging the innate and adaptive immune response. after receiving maturation stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, direct t-cell stimulation or recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns , the dc up-regulate the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex  class ii as well as a number of co-stimulatory markers  <cit> . during maturation the dc shift role from antigen up-take to antigen presentation on mhc and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs where the dc stimulate t-cells with the appropriate t-cell receptor. much work has been carried out to utilise the unique features of dc in clinical applications as ex vivo generation of dc has become standard practice  <cit> . especially, their role in the treatment of malignant neoplasms is one of the areas in which dc show great promise, due to their unique capacity to activate naïve t-cells  <cit> .

immunotherapies with the aid of dc have been shown to be a safe and non-reactogenic way to improve the immune response towards cancer  <cit> . however, it is clear that the immune responses achieved so far have not reached its theoretical potential and dc based therapies have not yet become a standard care of treatment  <cit> . a recent meta-study found that around 30% of  <dig> melanoma patients treated with matured dc had either complete response , partial response  or stable disease   <cit> . of the immunological parameters, particularly the induction of antigen specific t-cells was found to be predictive of a positive outcome .

the ex vivo protocol published by jonuleit et al. has been hailed as the 'gold standard' in dc maturation  <cit> . the combination of interleukin -1β, il- <dig>  tumour necrosis factor -α and prostaglandin e <dig>  has enabled researchers to produce ex vivo matured good manufacturing practice -grade dc in large numbers and good viability. this protocol, however, has its deficiencies as the resulting immune response is not optimal for therapeutic cancer vaccination, particularly with its lack of il-12p <dig> production  <cit> . to correct these deficiencies, a number of dc maturation protocols and a range of dc stimuli has been tested for use in cancer immunotherapy  <cit> .

the most critical aspect of dc in conjunction with clinical therapies is the t-cell stimulating capacity of the dc. the dc must be functionally mature in order to induce t-cell activation and not t-cell anergy. furthermore, the dc must have the ability to migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs to present antigens and induce the effector arm of the immune system. alternatively, the dc must be able to attract the t-cells to the site of dc injection by secreting signal substances like ccl <dig> and subsequently induce a t-cell response  <cit> .

in search of better maturation stimuli, we investigated the low-virulence strain of penicillin-killed streptococcus pyogenes  first described by okamoto and colleagues  <cit> . ok <dig> is available as a licensed drug  that has already been proven to have little side-effects and has been used efficiently to treat a variety of tumours  <cit> . a meta-study showed significantly better survival with chemotherapy combined with ok <dig> treatment  <cit> . the effect of ok <dig> in cancer patients is not adequately explained, but in vitro cultures of ok <dig> and dc induced the production of inflammatory cytokines  <cit>  and a th <dig> like type of response  <cit> . sato et al.  <cit>  did analyse the effect of ok <dig> on cells from  <dig> cancer patients with different tumours. moreover, a small number of patients with glioma enrolled in a phase i/ii trial received ok <dig> treated dendritic cells with promising results  <cit> . however, additional information is needed to conclude about the effect of ok <dig> on dc. this is especially important as cancer patients have an inflammatory tumour micro-environment that negatively affects the immune system that also vary between cancer types and progression .

we used ok <dig> as a maturation stimulus for dc, both alone in different concentrations or in combination with the jonuleit cytokine cocktail and compared it to the cytokine cocktail alone in order to understand the effect of ok <dig> on dc and its possible use in a clinical setting. we found increased secretion of a number of chemokines and cytokines that would result in a local inflammation stronger than that seen after maturation with the cytokine cocktail. furthermore, the important cytokines il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> were detected after maturation of dc with ok <dig>  as well as an up-regulated expression of cd <dig> and a marked increase in t-cell stimulatory capacity. the clinically approved ok <dig> has interesting properties and should be considered for further dc cancer immunotherapy.

methods
dc generation
dc were generated from monocytes isolated from buffy coat preparations from healthy blood donors  as described  <cit> . briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by a density gradient centrifugation and the monocytes were then isolated by plastic adherence. some experiments were performed with negatively isolated monocytes from buffy coat blood using the dynabeads® untouched™ human monocytes  following the manufacturer's instructions. the monocytes were cultured with il- <dig>  and gm-csf  in rp <dig> medium  with 10% fcs ;  <dig> units/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin ) for 5- <dig> days to generate immature dc. cytokines were replenished every 2- <dig> days. the maturation of dendritic cells was performed for  <dig> hours with a mix of stimuli  and pge <dig>   <dig> μg/ml  or with ok <dig> , or a combination of stimuli. the dose of ok <dig> was given in klinische einheit , where  <dig> ke equals approximately  <dig>  mg. two concentrations of ok <dig> were tested,  <dig>  and  <dig>  ke.

flowcytometry
immunostaining was performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, cells were incubated with a titrated amount of antibodies for  <dig> minutes at room temperature before the cells were washed and immediately analysed on a facscanto i cytometer . all subsequent analyses and gating were done with the flowjo software . one percent false-positive events were accepted in the isotype controls. the antibodies used were cd1-pe , cd8-pe , cd14-fitc , hla-dr-apc , cd38-alexa fluor  <dig>  cd86-fitc , cd83-pe , cd80-apc , cd40-fitc , all from abd serotec ; ccr7-pe,  from r&d systems ; cd4-apc , cd16-pe , cd56-apc  from immunotools, friesoythe, germany; and cd3-percp-cy <dig>   from bd biosciences .

mixed lymphocyte reaction 
allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells  depleted for monocytes were thawed and allowed to rest for  <dig> hours before being labelled with cfda-se  according to the manufacturer's instructions. two hundred thousand cfda-se labelled lymphocytes were then co-cultured with twenty or forty thousand extensively washed, irradiated, allogeneic matured dc. at the start of the co-culture  <dig> u/ml of il- <dig> and  <dig> ng/ml of il- <dig>  were added to ensure cd <dig> and cd <dig> t-cell survival. after  <dig> days the cells were harvested, stained for cd <dig> and cd <dig> for t-cell and cd <dig> and cd <dig> for nk cell analysis using a facs canto i flowcytometer. the gating strategy included exclusion of cell doublets.

chemotaxis assay
after maturation, the dc were harvested and washed extensively.  <dig>  <dig> live cells were added to the upper chamber of an  <dig> μm transwell 96-well plate  and left to migrate towards ccl <dig>  for  <dig> hours at 37°c, 5% co <dig> humidified atmosphere. the migrated cells were mixed with a known concentration of beads, counted with a facscanto i cytometer, and presented as a percentage of the total number of cells added to the upper well.

cytokine determination
to determine the concentration of cytokines and chemokines from the conditioned medium after maturation of the dc, aliquots of the supernatants were stored at -20°c. all samples were tested simultaneously in a 25-plex luminex assay cytokine and chemokine kit  and run on a luminex  <dig> system  according to the manufacturer's instructions. a sandwich elisa was run separately for il-12p <dig> , tgf-β <dig>  and il- <dig>  according to the manufacturer's instructions.

statistical analyses
to compare the effect of the stimuli on the dc, group wise analyses were performed with mann-whitney non-parametric test. significance was set at p <  <dig> . for the correlation examination, a bivariate analysis shown by the spearman coefficient  and the two-tailed test of significance was calculated. all statistical calculation was done with spss  <dig>  and the correlation heat maps were generated with the ivici program http://michnick.bcm.umontreal.ca/ivici/index.html.

RESULTS
ok <dig> treatment of dc results in maturation and induces higher levels of cd <dig> compared to the cytokine cocktail
in order to elucidate if the apparent effect seen by the clinical use of ok <dig> in treatment of tumours is mediated via dc, we first generated monocyte derived immature dc. after a 24-hour maturation stimulus with either  <dig>  ke ok <dig> or cytokine cocktail, both populations had a clear  up-regulation on the level of hla-dr and cd <dig> compared to the immature dc . a reduced dose of  <dig>  ke ok <dig> also induced a statistically significant, but lower, increase of hla-dr and cd <dig> compared to immature dc.

maturation of dc with the cytokine cocktail led to higher levels of the co-stimulatory markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and activation marker cd <dig>  on the cell surface than ok <dig> treated dc. the use of cytokine cocktail and ok <dig> led to a phenotype resembling that of cytokine cocktail alone. the level of cd <dig> together with the other co-stimulatory molecules is important for an adequate stimulation of t-cells  <cit> . ok <dig> induced a  <dig> percent higher median fluorescence intensity  of cd <dig> on the surface of the dc compared to cytokine cocktail alone  or cytokine cocktail and ok <dig>  the mfi values for all markers are given in additional file  <dig>  the level of ccr <dig>  a marker important for migration, was also investigated. however, the mfi was only modestly increased after ok <dig> treatment and the difference was not statistically significant.

cd <dig> is a cyclic adp ribose hydroxylase involved in the regulation of intracellular ca2+  <cit> . its surface expression on dc has been reported to have a range of different functions in migration, survival, il-12p <dig> production  <cit>  and support th <dig> skewing of the immune response  <cit> . ok <dig> up-regulated cd <dig> on mature dc , in contrast to the cytokine cocktail, which reduced cd <dig> expression compared to immature dc .

cytokine cocktail induces the highest level of chemotaxis
one possible reason for the promising clinical effects of ok <dig> might be an improved ability of dc to migrate to sites of inflammation. the differentially matured dc were therefore tested in a transwell migration assay to investigate if the different maturation stimuli resulted in changes in dc mobility towards ccr <dig> ligand ccl <dig> . this chemokine has been shown to be at least one order of magnitude more potent than ccl <dig> for directing dc chemotaxis in a murine model  <cit> . dc treated with the cytokine cocktail migrated best, followed by a combination of cocktail and  <dig> ke ok <dig>  which was slightly better in migration than the cytokine cocktail and  <dig> ke ok <dig>  of the dc that received only ok <dig>  the group that received  <dig> ke ok <dig> migrated to about the same extent as the dc matured with  <dig> ke ok <dig>  unlike previous reports, the level of cd <dig> as percent positive cells or as mfi  was not linked to better performance in the chemotaxis assay  <cit> .

ok <dig> elicits a pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profile
production and release into the medium of  <dig> cytokines and chemokines was analysed by a multiplex luminex assay and sandwich elisa . ok <dig> treatment induced the secretion of a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines that were not detected after maturation with the cytokine cocktail. il-1ra, -2r, - <dig>  - <dig>   <dig>  -12p <dig>  -12p <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  ifn-α, and ifn-γ and all the chemokines tested  were significantly  up-regulated after  <dig> hour stimulation with  <dig>  ke ok <dig> compared to the cytokine cocktail. tnf-α was borderline significantly higher  in supernatants from cells matured with ok <dig>  even though tnf-α was a part of the cytokine maturation cocktail and not added to the cultures receiving ok <dig>  the reduced concentration of  <dig> ke ok <dig> resulted in from a 2-fold increase to almost no detection of the secreted cytokines and chemokines compared to the cytokine cocktail, therefore a reduced concentration of ok <dig> did not achieve satisfying maturation.

in general, using combinations of the cytokine cocktail and ok <dig> resulted in a similar, but lower, level of cytokines and chemokines as compared to the cytokine cocktail alone. with regard to il-12p <dig> and il- <dig>  the production was lost or greatly reduced  when both stimuli were combined and thus the combination of cytokine cocktail and ok <dig> was of lesser interest. to exclude the possibility of inducing a regulatory t-cell response, the amount of tgf-β <dig> was measured and found not to be increased after ok <dig> treatment .

surface expression of maturation markers predict elevated chemotaxis
in order to understand the differences in maturation induced by the stimuli tested, a correlation analysis was undertaken to elucidate which of the parameters were regulated in a similar manner. the goal was two-fold; firstly to investigate which parameter predicted good migratory capacity for all matured dc and secondly; to envisage the differences between ok <dig> and the cytokine cocktail in general. the parameters included in the analysis were the percentage of positive cells for the surface markers tested and the mfi of cd <dig>  the concentration of  <dig> chemokines and cytokines in conditioned medium from the matured dc and the percentage of dc that migrated towards ccl <dig>  the analysis revealed that il- <dig> production and the surface expression of hla-dr, cd <dig> and cd <dig> were positively correlated with increased chemotaxis ability, shown by the spearman coefficient  . cxcl <dig> and il-1β were significantly negatively correlated with chemotaxis and the same trend was seen for cd <dig> but without statistical significance . ccr <dig> expressed as percent positive cells was only weakly associated with chemotaxis , this was also true when testing ccr <dig> mfi . to relate the different stimuli to all the parameters tested, a correlation analysis was performed and the correlation matrixes for the cytokine cocktail and ok <dig> are shown in a heat map  to allow an appreciation of the differences the two maturation stimuli have on the parameters tested. the figure clearly demonstrates that the cytokine cocktail and ok <dig> have distinctly effects on both the surface markers and secreted cytokines and chemokines.

dendritic cells matured with ok <dig> are best in allogeneic t-cell stimulation
as ok <dig> induced high surface expression of cd <dig> as well as high levels of cytokines and chemokines, we next tested if this increased inflammatory milieu surrounding matured dc would be of functional consequence in t-cell induction. combinations of ok <dig> and cytokine cocktail or reduced concentrations of ok <dig> were not tested in mlr as they did not elicit adequate maturation levels, chemotaxis and reduced level of secreted inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the dc. first, any direct stimulation effect of the t-cells by residual ok <dig> was ruled out as culturing t cells alone with  <dig>  ke ok <dig> resulted in no t-cell proliferation . the total nk cell compartment  showed no remarkable differences between the dc stimuli .

matured dc were co-cultured with allogeneic t-cells in a pbmc culture depleted for monocytes and the level of induced proliferation was measured by cfse-dilution . immature dc induced a low level of proliferation, with around  <dig> percent of cd <dig> and  <dig> percent cd <dig> positive lymphocytes having undergone more than  <dig> divisions after five days of co-culture. in comparison, using cytokine cocktail treated dc around  <dig> percent of cd <dig> and  <dig> percent of cd <dig> positive t-cells had undergone more than  <dig> divisions. ok <dig> treated dc induced extensive t-cell proliferation with more than  <dig> percent of cd <dig> and more than  <dig> percent of cd <dig> positive cells having undergone more than two cell divisions; most had undergone five or more cell divisions. importantly, ok <dig> treated dc stimulated 2- <dig> fold more cd <dig> positive t-cells in later generations  and about 2-fold more cd <dig> positive t-cells in later generations than cytokine cocktail treated dc .

discussion
the use of ok <dig> in different clinical applications has resulted in positive clinical outcomes over a period of several decades  <cit> . the immunomodulating mechanism behind ok <dig> has not yet been conclusively determined, but a general boost of the immune system seems evident. ok <dig> and other microbial products are sensed by pamps which results in an immune activation. this primes the immune system, as demonstrated by the effect of intralesional ok <dig> injections into lymphangioma  <cit> . these clinical experiences led us to investigate if ok <dig> might also be of use in other forms of immunomodulation. although other researchers have worked with ok <dig> and dc, a combination of ok <dig> and the cytokine cocktail has not been thoroughly investigated after dc stimulation. the effects of ok <dig> dosage and the combination with cytokine cocktail on dc maturation and the full range of chemokines and cytokines that we present have not been reported before.

elicitation of an anti-tumour immune response is the aim of cancer immunotherapy and for all dc based vaccine approaches the immune response relies heavily on the immune-stimulatory capacity of the dc population being used. this quality is above all dependent of the choice of maturation stimuli, which in the clinical protocols is often a cocktail of cytokines, first described by jonuleit et al.  <cit> . one challenging aspect with this protocol is the addition of pge <dig>  which is thought to be necessary to ensure dc survival and migration, and also induce expression of ox40l  <cit> . however, the production of il-12p <dig>  which is crucial for initiation of the required th <dig> type of response and the induction of high quality ctl, is lost by the use of the cytokine cocktail as also we have demonstrated, and this is due to the addition of pge <dig>  <cit> . pge <dig> treated dc have also been found to attract t-regulatory cells, which would be negative for induction of an immune response  <cit> . thus, palucka et al. summarised their work by emphasising that the next generation of dc immunotherapy should elicit high concentrations of il-12p <dig> and il- <dig>  in addition to surface expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the dc  <cit> .

stimulation with ok <dig> increased the secretion of nearly all cytokines and chemokines tested, suggestive of an increased local inflammation when used in immunotherapy. this included also il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> which have been found to be important for the proliferation of nk cells and ifn-γ production by dc, and both aspects are of importance in generating a potent th <dig> type of immune response  <cit> . endogenous il- <dig> production at the same time as antigen priming has been shown to be central to the priming and longevity of the ctl response  <cit> . from our data it is also clear that no synergistic effects could be detected as combinations of the cytokine cocktail and ok <dig> resulted in a greatly reduced il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> production. we cannot, however, rule out that a sequential stimulation might have changed this cytokine profile, as demonstrated with the tlr <dig> agonist poly i:c and the cytokine cocktail  <cit>  and this might be analysed in future studies. in a murine study, il- <dig> was found to boost vaccine-induced antitumour immunity by increasing both t-cell effector function and the nk cell numbers  <cit> , but only small differences were detected in nk cell numbers after co-culture of lymphocytes and dc in our experiments. from the presented cytokine and chemokine data it seems evident that the inflammatory milieu surrounding dc treated with ok <dig> was elevated and in the direction of a th <dig> response. also in wash-out cultures of ok <dig> treated dc, the il-12p <dig> production was sustained at a low level  for at least  <dig> hours without any stimuli . although that is considerably lower than after  <dig> hours with ok <dig> stimulation, it is still remarkable that the dc are able to secrete il-12p <dig> after the stimulus is lifted. as ok <dig> has a good safety profile, it could possibly also be used systemically after dc infusion in patients to prolong and sustain the proinflammatory response. a distinct set of immune responses was detected between ok <dig> and the cytokine cocktail from the correlation on the measured parameters. this illustrated clearly that ok <dig> and the cytokine cocktail affected the different parameters measured very differently with ok <dig> up-regulating more cytokines, chemokines and co-receptors.

when the different matured dc populations were tested in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, the inflammatory response induced by ok <dig> on dc was sustained in the absence of further stimuli. the secreted cytokines, chemokines and co-stimulatory molecules induced a high proliferation of both cd <dig> and cd <dig> t-cells. this is an indication that ok <dig> induced the dc to become more supportive of t-cell proliferation than the cytokine cocktail demonstrating the potential to stimulate the cell mediated immune response. importantly, the ok <dig> stimulated dc were particularly able to stimulate more than five divisions of t-cells, indicative of a robust immune response. stimulation of dc with ok <dig> resulted in a marked up-regulation of the important co-stimulatory marker cd <dig> on the surface of the dc, compared to cytokine cocktail alone, which has not been reported before with the  <dig> days dc generation protocol. engagement of cd <dig> on apc acts to license t-cells and thereby recruiting additional dc and making them more potent in eliciting an immune response  <cit> . the cd <dig> pathway indirectly amplifies the t-cell response and thus is important in inducing a good cell mediated immune response  <cit> , which may also be partly the reason why ok <dig> stimulated dc induced such a high level of t-cell activation.

the ability to migrate towards ccl <dig> differed significantly between the different stimuli. dc matured with ok <dig> and cytokine cocktail had similar levels of ccr <dig> expression; ok <dig> treated dc did nevertheless migrate less efficiently than dc treated with the cytokine cocktail. sakakibara et al.  <cit>  found ok <dig> dc to be better at chemotaxis than the cytokine cocktail dc, but they used less pge <dig> in the cytokine cocktail than jonuleit et al.  <cit> , which may account for the poorer migration of the cytokine cocktail treated dc. pge <dig> has been demonstrated to be important for activating the migration machinery, independent of the level of ccr <dig>  <cit> . this also illustrates that the in vitro chemotaxis of dc towards ccl <dig> is not determined solely by ccr <dig>  but also by additional mechanisms. furthermore, it has been suggested that a lower migration of dc could still be sufficient if the dc that migrate in vivo were able to induce a good t-cell response with a higher il-12p <dig> production than the cytokine cocktail dc  <cit> .

the adp ribose hydroxylase cd <dig> has been reported to be a novel marker for mature dc and involved in the migratory capacity of dc  <cit>  and we demonstrated that ok <dig> up-regulated this marker. the correlation analysis of all combined mature dc showed, however, that the chemotaxis was clearly related to a number of other maturation markers, particularly cd <dig> and cd <dig>  whereas no significant correlation was found to markers like cd <dig>  or indeed, to ccr <dig>  furthermore, cd <dig> expression seemed to be dependent on the maturation stimuli, rather than the maturation status, as cd <dig> was down-regulated on dc matured with the cytokine cocktail. other studies have shown that increased migratory capacity was linked to increased expression of cd <dig> on the surface of dc, but under maturation conditions without pge <dig>  <cit> . conversely, we found that ok <dig> treatment of dc up-regulated both cd <dig> and cd <dig>  but was still unable to induce chemotaxis to the same extent as the cytokine cocktail. initiation of migration is a complex chain of events  <cit> , but at least the level of cd <dig> induced by the ok <dig> did not seem to be the critical determinant for the induction of ccl <dig> directed chemotaxis.

CONCLUSIONS
as for the use of ok <dig> in cancer immunotherapy, we have demonstrated that ok <dig> is better than the cytokine cocktail in several critical aspects, i.e. il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> production, cd <dig> expression and t-cell stimulation. it would therefore be interesting to verify if this could also be beneficial when these dc are utilised in cancer immunotherapy. in conclusion, ok <dig> with its demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety profile is an attractive compound also in the context of dc based immunotherapy.
