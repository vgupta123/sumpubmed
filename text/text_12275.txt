BACKGROUND
because of the absence of sex, a brief evolutionary lifespan is generally expected for unisexual and asexual organisms  <cit> . nevertheless, ancient unisexuals and asexuals that persist millions of years have been discovered in various taxa among plants, fungi and animals  <cit> . with recent advances in molecular genetics and phylogenetics, our knowledge of reproductive systems and evolutionary histories of many unisexual and asexual lineages has been quickly improved. recent evidence reveals that many unisexuals are capable of utilizing modified reproductive modes and/or mitotic or meiotic mechanisms to incorporate "a bit of sex"  <cit> , or they can incorporate additional genetic material to compensate for the suspected lethal effects caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations  <cit> . thus, although populations may be all female, unisexual are not necessarily equivalent to asexual populations  <cit> . the discovery of ancient unisexual and asexual lineages not only poses a dilemma for evolutionary theoreticians but also provides an opportunity to address questions that relate to the prevalence and maintenance of sexual reproduction.

unisexuality in vertebrates has been discovered in about  <dig> lineages of fresh water fish, amphibians and reptiles  <cit> , most of which are recently spun off from sexual relatives via interspecific hybridization  <cit> . north american unisexual mole salamanders of the genus ambystoma co-evolve with five distinct sexual ambystomatids  across the entire unisexual distribution  <cit> . unisexual ambystoma persist as a "parasitic entity" by stealing and incorporating sperm from sympatric sexual species via a complex reproductive mode, kleptogenesis, to generate nearly  <dig> genomic combinations or biotypes, with ploidy levels ranging from diploid to pentaploid  <cit> . genomes in unisexuals may not be transmitted unaltered. recent studies using genomic in situ hybridization  demonstrate complex intergenomic exchanges in unisexual populations  <cit> .

despite the complexity of their nuclear genomes, all unisexuals contain a highly conserved mitochondrial genome which is derived from a. barbouri, suggesting that a. barbouri may be the maternal ancestor of the unisexual lineage  <cit> . although the ancestry of unisexual ambystoma is not contested by these studies, the age of the unisexual lineage is controversial. unisexual ambystoma have been proposed as the most ancient unisexual vertebrates known to exist  <cit> . based on a phylogeny constructed by the mitochondrial intergenic spacer and control region , bogart et al.  <cit>  estimated that the unisexual lineage and the closest relatives, an a. barbouri lineage from kentucky, are descended from the most recent common ancestor  <dig> - <dig>  million years ago . their results are based on the observation of a  <dig> % pairwise difference in the control region between unisexuals and a few kentucky a. barbouri individuals. on the contrary, robertson et al.  <cit>  constructed a phylogeny using a different mitochondrial marker cytochrome b  gene and suggested that unisexual ambystoma have a very recent origin which could be less than  <dig>  years ago. strikingly, they found a few a. barbouri specimens that were also used by bogart et al.  <cit>  to have an identical or almost identical cyt-b haplotype to unisexual individuals. such a large discrepancy is difficult to understand because the two different mitochondrial dna markers  that came from the same a. barbouri individuals demonstrated distinctly different evolutionary relationships to the unisexual lineage . therefore, the question: "are unisexual ambystoma ancient or recent?" is unresolved.

to provide a clearer answer to this question, we re-examined the phylogenetic relationship of unisexuals and a. barbouri from various populations using both mitochondrial cyt-b gene and ncr as markers. we especially focused on a. barbouri samples  that demonstrated distinctly different sequence divergences to the unisexuals in the two studies  <cit> . given that the rate of substitution likely varies for different genes/regions in the mitochondrial genome, we compared the substitution rates of complete mitochondrial genomes  of unisexual and a. barbouri. we sequenced the mtgenome of a kentucky a. barbouri specimen  that was used in both studies and provided conflicting results. we chose to sequence the mtgenome of one tetraploid unisexual a. laterale -  <dig> jeffersonianum  from a northern kentucky population as a representative unisexual. this individual was chosen because it was found to have the most common mitochondrial ncr haplotype among unisexuals , it was collected in a state  where unisexuals were previously unknown, and it was geographically close to the a. barbouri individuals that were deemed to be the closest relatives to unisexual ambystoma. for comparison, we also sequenced mtgenomes of one a. barbouri and one a. texanum from ohio to examine their phylogenetic relationships to the kentucky unisexual and a. barbouri individuals. the time to the most recent common ancestor  for unisexual lineage and its closest relative was re-calculated based on the mtgenome phylogeny.

RESULTS
mitochondrial cyt-b and ncr trees
primers glu14100l, mlm <dig> and m2r  were used to amplify and sequence a ~  <dig> base pairs  mitochondrial fragment that included cyt-b and ncr. a total of  <dig> cyt-b sequences, including one from an outgroup species  downloaded from genbank, were compared . of the  <dig> bp resolved,  <dig> sites were variable and  <dig> sites were phylogenetically informative. a total of  <dig> most parsimonious trees resulted from the parsimony analysis with  <dig> steps, a consistency index  of  <dig>  and a retention index  of  <dig> . for ncr,  <dig> sequences including one a. laterale from genbank were recovered . of the  <dig> bp resolved,  <dig> sites were variable and  <dig> sites were phylogenetically informative. a total of  <dig> most parsimonious trees were obtained from the parsimony analysis with  <dig> steps, a ci of  <dig>  and a ri of  <dig> . for both markers, a gtr+i+g model was selected as the best-fit model. the cyt-b strict consensus tree  was nearly identical to the bayesian tree, but ncr strict consensus  and bayesian trees yielded slightly different topologies. the bayesian trees with the bpp and bsp from the parsimony analyses are presented in figure  <dig> 

voucher numbers in bold represent specimens whose mtgenomes were sequenced.

* all unisexuals have at least one a. laterale  nuclear genome. the unisexuals used in the present study also have a. jeffersonianum  or a. texanum  nuclear genomes.

both cyt-b and ncr trees clustered all specimens into four clades . all the unisexuals, irrespective of their biotypes and ploidy levels, formed a monophyletic clade a. clade a was sister to clade b that contained a. barbouri individuals from southern ohio and west of the kentucky rivers in central kentucky. this clade corresponded to the a. barbouri "western clade" in niedzwiecki's study  <cit> . clade c contained a. barbouri from north or east of the kentucky river and north of the ohio river, as well as the disjunct populations in western kentucky. this clade corresponded to the "northern clade" that was identified by niedzwiecki  <cit> . clade d included a. texanum and a. barbouri from tennessee. in the ncr tree, the relationship of clade d in respect to three other clades was, however, not well resolved but the monophyly of clade a+ clade b was strongly supported .

in robertson et al.'s study  <cit> , four specimens  of a. barbouri were found to be clustered in the unisexual clade and three of them  shared the same cyt-b haplotype with some of the unisexuals . we sequenced the cyt-b gene from the very same individuals but we found that none of them shared an identical or almost identical haplotype to any unisexual. we examined the sequence chromatogram of cyt-b in these individuals and only single signal peaks were observed at every site. all four samples were grouped in clade b with other a. barbouri where the average cyt-b sequence divergence between a. barbouri and unisexuals was  <dig> % . likewise, no a. barbouri shared the same or even a very similar ncr sequence with unisexuals , and the ingroup relationship in the ncr tree was concordant with that obtained by bogart et al.  <cit> .

amplification of cyt-b gene by mvz <dig> and mvz16
bogart et al.  <cit>  used primers mlmthr and mlm <dig> to obtain a ~ <dig> bp intergenic spacer and control region from unisexual and a. barbouri specimens. we compared our sequencing results using the same primers and confirmed that mlmthr and mlm <dig> produced the identical sequences to those by using primers gmm. primers mvz <dig> and mvz <dig> were used by robertson et al.  <cit>  to amplify an ~ <dig> bp cyt-b fragment from ambystomatids. in their study, a. barbouri individuals jpb <dig>  jpb <dig>  jpb <dig> and jpb <dig> were found to contain an identical or almost identical haplotype to unisexuals which placed them in the unisexual clade. using the same primers, we failed to duplicate the same sequencing results in jpb <dig> and jpb <dig> as discovered by robertson et al.  <cit> . cyt-b failed to amplify in jpb <dig> when using mvz <dig> and mvz <dig> but primers gmm confirmed that jpb <dig> did not contain a unisexual haplotype. the results showed that these three individuals shared a. barbouri cyt-b haplotypes that were grouped with other a. barbouri in clade b . we found, however, that jpb <dig> did have a unisexual-like cyt-b haplotype as was found by robertson et al.  <cit>  using mvz <dig> and mvz <dig> as pcr and sequencing primers. this contradictory result was unexpected. we further examined the sequence chromatogram of jpb <dig> and found that its sequence contained many heterozygous sites  in positions where the variable sites between unisexuals and clade b a. barbouri were located . at these heterozygous sites, a. barbouri's sequence signals were generally weaker than unisexual-like sequence signals so the latter would be read by the program by default . we ruled out the possibility of dna cross contamination and mitochondrial heteroplasmy in jpb <dig> because, using primers gmm which targeted a much longer fragment for pcr amplification and sequencing, we consistently found a pure a. barbouri haplotype from jpb <dig>  in the sequence chromatogram, unisexual-like sequence signals were no longer detectable . we used various primer combinations to amplify mitochondrial genes of jpb <dig> using a new dna extraction in the present study as well as an old dna extraction used by robertson et al.  <cit> . none of the amplicons showed any signs of dna contamination or mitochondrial heteroplasmy. additionally, through sequencing the mtgenome of a. barbouri jpb <dig>  unisexual jpb <dig> and other specimens we showed that cyt-b gene did not have any duplicated component residing in the mitochondrial genome. a plausible explanation was that jpb <dig> contained a nuclear copy  of a unisexual-like mitochondrial cyt-b gene fragment . when using whole genomic dna as template, both the actual mitochondrial cyt-b gene and its nuclear numt could have been co-amplified by mvz <dig> and mvz <dig>  to further test this prediction we used the mitochondrial dna fragment as a template and conducted sequencing pcr using mvz <dig> and mvz <dig> as primers. the results showed that no heterozygous sites existed in the sequence chromatogram  and jpb <dig> did not contain a unisexual-like cyt-b haplotype in its mitochondrial genome. another primer combination using mvz <dig> and mlm <dig>  was also used to amplify cyt-b using jpb <dig> whole genomic dna as template and no unisexual-like signals were detected in that sequence chromatogram.

mtgenome phylogeny
a total of  <dig> mtgenome sequences, including  <dig> downloaded from genbank, were used for phylogenetic construction . the combined dna dataset contained  <dig> bp with  <dig> variable sites and  <dig> were phylogenetically informative. parsimony analysis generated a single tree  <dig> steps in length . for bayesian analysis, a gtr+i+g model was selected as the best-fit model. the tree topologies derived from parsimony and bayesian analyses were similar, with slight differences in the relationships of some outgroup species, and we present the bayesian tree in figure  <dig>  the monophyly of kentucky a. barbouri jpb <dig> and unisexual jpb <dig> was strongly supported by both analyses .

the overall sequence divergence of mtgenome between the unisexual sample jpb <dig> and a. barbouri jpb <dig> was  <dig> % . we divided the mtgenome into  <dig> partitions and the pairwise difference of each partition ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . all  <dig> protein-coding genes were rather variable between genomes of jpb <dig> and jpb <dig>  except for nd4l  and atp <dig> , the pairwise differences of all other genes were no less than  <dig> %. jpb <dig> was found to have an identical cyt-b haplotype to unisexuals by robertson et al.  <cit> . our study clearly demonstrated that neither the cyt-b gene nor any other genes, trnas or ncr throughout the mitochondrial genome were the same between a. barbouri jpb <dig> and the unisexual.

molecular dating
the relaxed lognormal clock analysis of the mtgenome sequences by beast produced the same topology as the bayesian analysis. the divergence times estimated by beast and multidivtime are listed in table  <dig>  in general, the time estimates by beast and multidivtime were largely congruent. we present a time-calibrated tree from beast in figure  <dig>  the split between unisexual ambystoma and kentucky a. barbouri  took place about  <dig>  ma  by beast, and  <dig>  ma  by multidivtime. both analyses agreed that the origin of the unisexual linage may date back to early pliocene.

discussion
no ambystoma barbouri shares an identical mitochondrial cyt-b gene with unisexuals
the phylogenies generated using cyt-b, ncr as well as mtgenome all support the hypothesis that unisexual ambystoma form a monophyletic group and share the most recent common ancestor with an a. barbouri lineage from kentucky  <cit> . the age of unisexual ambystoma was in high disagreement because four a. barbouri individuals  examined by two previous studies demonstrated distinctly different phylogenetic relationships to the unisexual lineage. robertson et al.  <cit>  found that these four a. barbouri were grouped with the unisexual cyt-b clade that suggested a very recent origin of unisexual lineage which was less than  <dig>  years ago. on the other hand, bogart et al.  <cit>  found a  <dig> % sequence pairwise distance in the control region between unisexuals and a few kentucky a. barbouri individuals  and claimed an ancient evolutionary history of unisexual ambystoma, approximately  <dig> - <dig>  ma. when using primers targeting a long mitochondrial fragment , we found that no a. barbouri, including the four controversial a. barbouri individuals used by robertson et al.  <cit> , shared the same cyt-b gene sequence with unisexuals. the average cyt-b sequence pairwise distance between unisexuals  and their closest a. barbouri relatives  is as high as  <dig> %. the examination of mtgenome of the representative specimens further demonstrated that neither the cyt-b gene, nor other genes/regions in the mitochondrial genome were identical or almost identical between unisexuals and a. barbouri. the overall substitution rates throughout the mitochondrial genome, especially in protein coding genes, were found to be rather consistent. through a thorough sampling of a. barbouri across its distribution, niedzwiecki  did not find any haplotype that was more similar to the unisexuals than western clade kentucky a. barbouri including specimens jpb <dig>  jpb <dig>  jpb <dig> and jpb <dig>  therefore, all our evidence clearly demonstrates that there is no known a. barbouri that shares an identical cyt-b gene with unisexuals.

molecular dating demonstrates an ancient origin of unisexual ambystoma
in our beast analysis, the rate covariance among adjacent branches was  <dig>  which was close to zero and their 95% confident intervals spanned zero . this result suggests that rate autocorrelation is insignificant  <cit>  and beast , rather than multidivtime , would be more appropriate for the data and calibration choices in our study. nevertheless, our results show that the time estimations between beast and multidivtime are largely congruent, especially within the ambystomatid salamanders . both analyses show that unisexual ambystoma and kentucky a. barbouri descended from their most recent common ancestor about  <dig> ma so this dichotomy likely occurred in early pliocene. more conservatively, if we take the lowest value at 95% ci inferred by both analyses, the unisexual lineage originated at least  <dig> ma . generally, our estimate was consistent with previous time estimates of the origin of unisexual ambystoma  <cit>  which validates them as the most ancient unisexual vertebrate lineage known to exist  <cit> .

niedzwiecki  <cit>  suggested that the kentucky and ohio rivers likely act as barriers between western and northern a. barbouri mtdna clades . the kentucky river might have been responsible for the divergence between a. barbouri from a. texanum as well as for the divergence of geographically distinct a. barbouri mtdna lineages. using a rough calibration approach   <cit> , niedzwiecki  <cit>  estimated that various a. barbouri mitochondrial lineages were separated around  <dig> - <dig> ma and a similar time would have elapsed since the split between the main a. barbouri clades and a. texanum. our study suggests that both divergence times are possibly more ancient than these estimates. in the beast analysis, for example, the separation between kentucky a. barbouri  and ohio a. barbouri  likely took place  <dig>  ma . the split of western and northern a. barbouri from a. texanum likely occurred  <dig>  ma . our results indicate that both events may have taken place in late to middle miocene or at least in early pliocene, suggesting a longer evolutionary history for a. barbouri than expected.

is a unisexual-like cyt-b numt present in a. barbouri?
nuclear copies of mitochondrial genes or numts, which evolve independently as paralogous copies of the original mitochondrial dna segment, are relatively common and have been reported in various taxa  <cit> . failure to discriminate real mitochondrial sequences and numts often confuses the genetic diversity of species and produces erroneous phylogenies  <cit> . because the nuclear genome has an overall slower mutation rate than the mitochondrial genome, estimates on divergence times can be problematic  <cit> . numts can originate from all parts of the mitochondrial genome including the cyt-b gene  <cit>  and the majority of numts are fairly short sequences  <cit> .

when using whole genomic dna as template and primers mvz <dig> and mvz <dig> for pcr amplification and sequencing  <cit> , a. barbouri individual jpb <dig> possessed two different pcr products. one of the two was not detectable in the sequence chromatograms when using mitochondrial dna as template with mvz15/mvz <dig> as sequencing primers, or using total genomic dna as template with other various primer combinations. dna cross contamination can yield sequence heterozygosity but contamination should have affected each gene/region across the entire mtgenome. we tested the old dna extractions of a. barbouri individuals  used by robertson et al.  <cit> , and we did not find any signs of dna contamination in any other genes/regions. mitochondrial heteroplasmy may also be responsible for mixed mitochondrial amplicons  <cit> . the possibility that these a. barbouri individuals embrace a. barbouri and complete unisexual-like mtgenomes is minimal as proven by the experiments we conducted above. mitochondrial heteroplasmy could also be caused by regional mutations or duplications of some mitochondrial copies  <cit> . if these a. barbouri individuals have two types of mtgenomes which are heteroplasmic only in the cyt-b gene, we should have detected the heterozygous signals in the cyt-b gene when using old/new total genomic dna extractions or mitochondrial dna as templates with any primer combinations for pcr and sequencing. the most reasonable explanation is that a. barbouri individual jpb <dig> contains a unisexual-like cyt-b numt. this unexpected discovery in jpb <dig> has resolved the mystery and provides a reasonable explanation for the data that were obtained by robertson et al.  <cit> . we believe that a unisexual-like cyt-b numt was present in some a. barbouri individuals, including jpb <dig>  jpb <dig>  jpb <dig>  and jpb <dig>  it is very possible, in their study, that the cyt-b sequences recovered from these four a. barbouri were in fact unisexual-like numts. therefore, the subsequent phylogenetic construction and divergence time estimates that were based on these putative numts were erroneous. although we did not detect stop codons in these numts, it is known that numts do not always include stop codons or indels and sometimes are indistinguishable to their mitochondrial orthologs  <cit> . it is possible, however, that the stop codons were situated up/downstream beyond the region amplified by the mvz15/mvz <dig> primers that we used. whether numts can be amplified may also depend on the quality and quantity of nuclear dna template in the pcr reaction. in our study we failed to find or amplify the same sequences in three other controversial specimens jpb <dig>  jpb <dig> and jpb <dig>  which likely resulted from the more highly degraded nuclear genomic dna from these samples.

implications of having an ancestral cyt-b numt in a. barbouri
dating the origin of unisexual/asexual lineages is usually based on the extent of genetic divergence from their nearest sexual relatives  <cit> . in general, time estimates are more robust if both mitochondrial and nuclear genomic markers are used as inferences. uncoupling evolutionary trajectories between their mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, however, make molecular dating of unisexual ambystoma depend solely on the mitochondrial genome. all unisexual ambystoma share one mitochondrial origin but the evolutionary histories of their nuclear genomes are much more complicated and dynamic. it is clear that no recurrent hybridization between any of the sexual sperm donors produces new unisexual lineages  <cit>  otherwise unisexual individuals would contain a mitochondrial genome derived from one or more of the extant sexual, sperm - donating species of ambystoma. bogart et al.  <cit>  showed that a. barbouri can serve as a sperm donor for unisexuals in a single pond from southern ohio. the cyt-b and ncr haplotypes recovered from those a. barbouri were found to be grouped in clade c , and are distantly related to the unisexuals. without recurrent hybridization, unisexual individuals have evolved an extremely flexible reproductive mode by which they rely on sexual sperm donors to perpetuate. unisexuals replace their nuclear genomes with those from sexual sperm donors, historically and contemporarily, throughout their entire distribution  <cit> . consequently, it is impossible to use nuclear genome sequences for molecular dating of unisexual ambystoma.

little and hebert  <cit>  have criticized the traditional dating strategy used for unisexual and asexual organisms  <cit>  because dating, not only requires a thorough search of extant taxa, but also related species that may have gone extinct since unisexuality/asexuality originated. neiman et al.  <cit>  reviewed asexual lineage longevity among invertebrate and vertebrate taxa and criticized the notion that there existed young and "ancient" asexual lineages. they found that the distribution of asexual lineages followed a regular and linear age distribution. the tabulated ages of asexual vertebrate lineages  were all less than  <dig>  years old and could even be considered young compared with the estimated age of a sexual species. the unisexual ambystoma lineage was included in their table of asexual lineages with an age < <dig>  years based on the incorrect time estimate provided by robertson et al.  <cit> . our present study demonstrates that unisexual ambystoma have persisted for about  <dig> million years and we attribute this longevity to the fact that they are unisexual, not asexual, and have a unique reproductive mode  <cit> .

because a. barbouri may have an ancient evolutionary history , it is reasonable to assume that there may have existed a closer common ancestor to the unisexuals which became extinct at some unknown time  <cit> . finding a unisexual-like cyt-b numt in some a. barbouri individuals suggests that its origination must have taken place at about the same time as the hybridization event that gave rise to unisexuals. once a numt is established in its descendants' nuclear dna, it would be much more conserved than the mitochondrial haplotype because the mitochondrial cyt-b mutates faster than its numt. the presence of an ancestral cyt-b numt in the western kentucky clade of a. barbouri would also suggest that no other population of a. barbouri, including any potential extinct lineages, needs to be considered more closely related to the unisexuals.

CONCLUSIONS
using multiple sets of empirical evidence and rigorous statistical methodologies, we reject the conclusion of a recent origin of unisexual ambystoma and support the hypothesis that unisexual ambystoma is the most ancient lineage in unisexual vertebrates known to exist. the amplification of unisexual-like cyt-b sequence in a few kentucky a. barbouri individuals is the possible cause of the erroneous phylogeny and time estimate determined by robertson et al.  <cit> . the unisexual-like cyt-b sequence, presumably a numt, in a few kentucky a. barbouri could represent a useful molecular "fossil" showing that the a. barbouri lineage from kentucky represents the closest relatives to the unisexuals. interestingly, our study shows that the unisexuals' mitochondrial genomes, which are descended from ancestral a. barbouri, seem to have changed little over time because their cyt-b genes are very similar to the ~ <dig> bp ancestral cyt-b numt amplified sequence identified in some extant a. barbouri individuals. low mitochondrial dna variation among present unisexual populations have been described before  <cit>  and it might be attributed to population bottlenecking of unisexuals prior to their rapid expansion after the last glacial maximum. the length, number of copies and distribution of the cyt-b numt in a. barbouri is not yet known and there may be other a. barbouri individuals that have similar cyt-b numts and/or other ancient signatures shared with unisexuals. the confirmation of an ancient ancestry of unisexual ambystoma validates them as an excellent model system for studying the evolution and maintenance of unisexuality in vertebrates.
