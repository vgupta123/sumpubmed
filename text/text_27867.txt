BACKGROUND

gossypium hirsutum l. , one of  <dig> gossypium species and the leading natural fiber crop, contributes to more than 95 % of total cotton production  <cit> . short-season cotton, or early-maturity cotton, is a type of g. hirsutum with a relatively short growth period. earliness, a distinctive characteristic of short-season cotton, is a complex agronomic trait of a quantitative genetic nature  <cit> . in terms of plant development, earliness may be described in reference to budding date, flowering timing  and the whole growth period   <cit> . other agronomic traits, such as plant height , node of the first fruiting branch  and height of the nffb , have also been used as earliness indexes  <cit> . for example, godoy and palomo concluded that the lower the nffb and the shorter the ph, the earlier the maturity  <cit> . to alleviate food crises, a large amount of farmland previously used for cotton planting is now devoted to food crops, especially in china. to exploit these limited natural resources via breeding programs and manage the competition between cereal crops and cotton through crop rotation, cotton earliness is attracting an increasing amount of attention from breeders  <cit> .

although a decrease in genetic diversity increases the difficulty of breeding by hybridization  <cit> , marker-assisted selection  is a promising approach for cotton breeding because it shortens breeding cycles with more accuracy  <cit> . following the publication of the first allotetraploid cotton genetic map in  <dig>  <cit> , a host of research programs have been dedicated to genetic map construction  and quantitative trait locus  mapping . because anonymous marker-based maps are becoming saturated, a genetic map based on conventional markers cannot achieve the resolution required for fine qtl mapping or positional cloning. single nucleotide polymorphisms  are highly abundant and suitable for high-density genetic mapping  <cit> . restriction-site associated dna sequencing  is a powerful and cost-effective method for detecting genetic variations  <cit>  and has become widely applied in plants . moreover, landmark breakthroughs in genome sequencing of cotton species such as g. raimondii  <cit>  g. arboretum  <cit> , g. barbadense  <cit>  and g. hirsutum l.  <cit> , have been achieved and will facilitate the detection of snp markers.

compared with the number of studies evaluating fiber quality, limited investigations have been conducted to identify genetic signatures for earliness . the genetic bases of earliness are poorly understood and present findings are insufficient for application to breeding practices. to provide additional information for breeding programs designed for specific traits, the molecular mechanisms underlying cotton earliness must thus be further investigated.

the research strengthes of our team in regard to short-season cotton were exploited to advance genetic understanding of earliness, thereby allowing us to construct immortalized recombinant inbred lines  consisting of  <dig> families from two g. hirsutum inbred lines: ccri <dig> and g <dig>  the purpose of the present study was to  construct an intra-specific high-resolution genetic map for g. hirsutum using rad-seq,  detect qtls related to earliness for mas in short-season cotton breeding and  lay a foundation for fine mapping and positional cloning for use in future studies.

RESULTS
snp detection and genetic map construction
for library construction, taqαi was chosen as the enzyme mainly because of its uniformly distributed cutting sites and sufficient coverage across the entire cotton genome . we obtained  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads for ccri <dig> and g <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads per line for the ril population. the average q <dig> score was  <dig>  %, demonstrating the high quality of the sequences . all read sequences generated in this study are available in the sequence read archive  under accession number prjna <dig>  for the genome sequence alignment of g. hirsutum  <cit> , the depth of the parental materials reached  <dig> × for g <dig> and  <dig> × for ccri <dig>  the average sequence depth of the  <dig> lines reached  <dig> × . we obtained  <dig>  snps, of which  <dig>  were polymorphic between the parents. the at sub-genome contained  <dig>  snps, of which  <dig>   were polymorphic; the dt sub-genome contained  <dig>  snps, of which  <dig>   were polymorphic . the percentage of marker polymorphisms on each chromosome varied from  <dig>  % on chromosome a <dig> to  <dig>  % on a <dig> table  <dig> statistical description of sequence data obtained from the parents and the recombinant inbred line  population

for the construction of the genetic map, simple snps between the parents, represented as aa × bb, were selected in addition to the ssr markers. the final genetic map was composed of  <dig>  loci including  <dig>  simple snps and  <dig> ssr loci; it spanned  <dig> .98 cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers . the at sub-genome contained a larger number of markers  compared with the dt sub-genome . the average distance between adjacent markers was  <dig>  cm in the at sub-genome and  <dig>  cm in the dt sub-genome. marker distributions and linkage lengths varied among chromosomes. chromosome a <dig> contained the most loci,  <dig>  whereas d <dig> contained the fewest,  <dig>  the largest linkage group was a <dig>  with  <dig>  cm; the shortest was d <dig>  with  <dig>  cm. the highest marker density was on a <dig>  which had an average marker interval of only  <dig>  cm. the largest gap among all chromosomes was  <dig>  cm on d <dig> fig.  <dig> linkage groups on the high-density genetic map. the <dig> chromosomes of the at sub-genome are shown on the upper part, the  <dig> chromosomes of the dt sub-genome are shown on the lower part





phenotypic variation
the mapping population was planted continuously from  <dig> to  <dig> at anyang. we surveyed six earliness-related traits: wgp, ft, fbp, ph, nffb and hnffb.

large differences existed between the parents, with g <dig> exhibiting a later ft and nffb appearance, a longer wgp and fbp, and a higher ph and hnffb than ccri <dig> . all the six traits followed an approximately normal distribution and showed transgressive segregation in the ril population, which indicated that the latter was a typical population for qtl detection . although been significantly affected by environmental effects, the broad-sense heritabilities of the six traits ranged from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, thereby demonstrating that the phenotypic variation was mainly genetically controlled and indicating in turn the potential for performing genetic modifications for earliness . a simple correlation analysis showed that all six traits were positively correlated with one another . ft was significantly positively correlated with the other five traits in all 6 years except with nffb in  <dig> and fbp in  <dig> and  <dig>  in which significance levels of p =  <dig>  or p =  <dig>  were not reached. wgp was also significantly positively correlated with the other five traits in the 6 years except for with hnffb in  <dig>  ph had a significant positive correlation with the other five traits except for with fbp in  <dig> and  <dig>  fbp showed significant positive correlations with wgp and ft over the 6 years, with less significant correlations with ph, nffb or hnffb in  <dig> and  <dig>  nffb was significantly positively correlated with the other five traits over the years except for 2011; for this year, only the correlation between nffb and hnffb reached the p =  <dig>  significance level. hnffb was significantly positively correlated with the other five traits in the 6 years except for wgp and fbp in  <dig>  the results of the correlation analysis are consistent with the conclusion that the lower the nffb and the shorter the ph, the earlier the maturity  <cit> , and also suggest the high likelihood of gene pleiotropy or tightly linked functional genes.table  <dig> anova analysis of the six earliness-related traits

qtl analysis
to reveal the genetic factors underlying cotton earliness, data for the six traits for the 6 years were analyzed separately and then combined using average values. a total of  <dig> qtls were identified on all  <dig> chromosomes, including  <dig> qtls for ft,  <dig> for wgp,  <dig> for fbp,  <dig> for ph,  <dig> for nffb, and  <dig> for hnffb . chromosome d <dig> contained  <dig> qtls and ranked first among the  <dig> chromosomes, whereas a <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> contained fewer than  <dig> qtls. a total of  <dig> stable qtls were detected in at least two environments, and  <dig> qtls accounted for more than 10 % of the phenotypic variation . the paternal material g <dig> and maternal material ccri <dig> provided  <dig> and  <dig> of the trait-increasing alleles, respectively. of the total qtls,  <dig> were located on the at sub-genome and  <dig> were located on the dt sub-genome. nineteen stable qtls were located on the at sub-genome, with the remaining  <dig> on the dt sub-genome.

wgp
wgp is important for successful cultivation and represents the first index for evaluating earliness because it directly indicates the extent of maturity  <cit> . forty-seven qtls for wgp were identified, including  <dig> stable and  <dig> major qtls. of the three stable qtls located on d <dig>  qgp-d3- <dig> was detected in 3 years and in the combined analysis. qwgp-d3- <dig> at  <dig>  cm was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> and explained  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv. qwgp-a12- <dig>  detected in  <dig> and in the combined analysis, respectively explained  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the observed pv.

ft
flowering is the transition from vegetative to reproductive stages and represents an efficient signal of earliness  <cit> . for maximal yield, tailoring of ft in the crop life cycle is essential. in this study, a total of  <dig> qtls were detected for ft, with  <dig> explaining  <dig>  %- <dig>  % of the pv and  <dig> being stably detected over time. qft-d3- <dig> at  <dig> – <dig>  cm was stably detected in five years from  <dig> to  <dig> and in the combined analysis; it accounted for  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the pv in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and the combined analysis, respectively. qft-d3- <dig> at  <dig> – <dig>  cm was detected in 3 years and in the combined analysis and explained  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the pv in  <dig> and the combined analysis, respectively. application of ft as an indicator of cotton earliness revealed the fragment from  <dig> – <dig>  cm on d <dig> as an interesting candidate region, with ccri <dig> conferred favorable alleles.

fbp
fbp is a primary component of cotton development after flowering and directly affects harvesting rate. forty qtls were detected for fbp, with  <dig> stable qtls detected in at least  <dig> environments and  <dig> explaining more than 10 % of the pv. the four qtls, qfbp-a5- <dig>  qfbp-d3- <dig>  qfbp-d5- <dig> and qfbp-d7- <dig>  were detected in three environments; the latter two qtls explained more than 10 % of the pv. the qtl qfbp-d13- <dig> was detected in  <dig> and  <dig> and explained more than 10 % of the pv in both years.

ph
ph is an important agronomic trait that influences plant architecture, production and mechanization. thirty-three qtls for ph were obtained, including  <dig> stable qtls and  <dig> major qtls that explained 10 %– <dig>  % of the observed pv. eight of the  <dig> stable qtls were detected in the dt sub-genome, and  <dig> were detected on chromosome d <dig>  the five qtls, qph-d3- <dig> , qph-d3- <dig> , qph-d3- <dig> , qph-d3- <dig>  and qph-d12- <dig> , were detected in three environments, with g <dig> conferring the favorable allele increasing ph. qph-d3- <dig> and qph-d3- <dig>  detected in  <dig> and  <dig> and in the combined analysis, explained  <dig>  %– <dig>  % and  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv, respectively. qph-d3- <dig> and qph-d3- <dig> were detected in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and explained  <dig>  %– <dig>  % and  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv, respectively. qph-d12- <dig> was detected in 2013– <dig>  and explained  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv.

nffb
nffb has been suggested as an indicator of ft and a measure of relative photoperiodism  <cit> . a total of  <dig> qtls were detected for nffb in this study, with  <dig> major qtls explaining  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv. all nine stable qtls were in the dt sub-genome. qnffb-d2- <dig>  and qnffb-d3- <dig>  were detected in 3 years and in the combined analysis; they explained  <dig>  %– <dig>  % and  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv, respectively. another seven stable qtls were detected in two environments.

hnffb
hnffb, a primary component of ph, is significantly positively correlated with ft and wgp. forty-five qtls for hnffb were detected, including  <dig> stable and  <dig> major qtls. the four stable qtls, qhnffb-a4- <dig>  qhnffb-a7- <dig>  qhnffb-a11- <dig> and qhnffb-a13- <dig>  were located on the at sub-genome. two notable qtls, qhnffb-d3- <dig> at  <dig> – <dig>  cm and qhnffb-d3- <dig> at  <dig>  cm, were detected in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and in the combined analysis; they explained  <dig>  %– <dig>  % and  <dig>  %– <dig>  % of the pv, respectively. g <dig> conferred the favorable allele that increased hnffb.

qtl coincidence and gene annotation
the qtl mapping results indicated  <dig> qtl coincidence regions  on  <dig> chromosomes, and more than 60 % of all qtls  were involved in these regions. a total of  <dig>  % of the wgp qtls—the highest value among the six traits—were located in coincidence regions, followed by qtls for hnffb , fbp , ph , nffb  and ft . most qtls in the same coincidence regions presented the same allelic direction, a phenomenon that explains the significant positive correlation among the six traits and is consistent with the speculation of gene pleiotropy or tightly linked functional genes . in addition, each trait had characteristic qtls that might be useful for specific trait modification or ideotype breeding.table  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for the six studied traits and qtls located in coincidence regions

ft and fbp are two of the main components of wgp. ft and wgp had  <dig> common qtl coincidence regions that included  <dig> ft and  <dig> wgp qtls, whereas fbp and wgp had  <dig> common coincidence regions that included  <dig> fbp and  <dig> wgp qtls. in contrast, only six common coincidence regions were identified between ft and fbp; they included  <dig> ft and  <dig> fbp qtls. hnffb is a primary component of ph, and they shared  <dig> common qtl coincidence regions that included  <dig> hnffb and  <dig> ph qtls . this phenomenon demonstrates the plasticity of earliness-related traits during developmental stages.table  <dig> number of coincidence regions and coincident quantitative trait loci  between  <dig> trait pairs

among the  <dig> qtl coincidence regions, one chromosome region on d <dig> was extraordinary. five stable qtls were located in the core interval of  <dig> – <dig>  cm: qft-d3- <dig>  qwgp-d3- <dig>  qph-d3- <dig>  qnffb-d3- <dig> and qhnffb-d3- <dig>  which all had the same allele direction. in addition, qfbp-d3- <dig>  which was detected in  <dig>  was also found in this region . among the six qtls, qft-d3- <dig> was stably detected from  <dig> to  <dig> and was also detected in the combined analysis; thus, this qtl features high reliability for fine mapping. six snps were mapped in the core region defined by marker <dig> and marker <dig>  based on the homozygous genotype of these six snps, we classified the  <dig> rils into two groups. as expected, the lines inheriting the homozygous qtls from ccri <dig> flowered and matured earlier and had smaller phenotypes than those carrying the homozygous allele of g2005; in addition, all six traits exhibited stable phenotypic differences among the 6 years . a total of  <dig> recombinants occurred in the ril population at this locus, which allowed us to narrow down the interval to a 2-mb region between marker <dig> and marker <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes were annotated in this region .fig.  <dig> quantitative trait loci detected on a noteworthy region of chromosome d <dig>  fbp: flowering to boll-opening period; ph: plant height; ft: flowering timing; wgp: whole growth period; nffb: node of the first fruiting branch; hnffb: height of the nffb

one gene, named emf <dig>  was primarily verified by qrt-pcr. the qrt-pcr analysis reflected that emf <dig> had the lowest expression level in the early-maturing cultivar ccri <dig> and the highest in bomian <dig>  with shan <dig> intermediate . in all three cultivars, the expression level of emf <dig> decreased during the progression from the three- to the six true-leaf stage. this emf <dig> expression trend was consistent with that of flower buds differentiation in cotton. we therefore conclude that emf <dig> in cotton may also have a significant influence on flowering and is thus a potential candidate gene for use in further studies.

discussion
in this study, we selected ccri <dig> and g <dig> as parents for construction of a ril population containing  <dig> lines. ccri <dig> is an excellent early-maturity cultivar with high yield production. g <dig> is a g. barbadense introgression line in the background of g. hirsutum and has a relatively longer growth period. this hybrid combination can both enrich the diversity of the intra-specific genetic mapping population and introduce desirable genes from g. barbadense into upland cotton for direct use on breeding, thus overcoming the difficulties of inter-specific crossing in cotton breeding  <cit> . the generated ril population is therefore of great significance, both for theoretical genetic research and elite germplasm selection.

genetic map is the first requisite for understanding the genetic mechanisms of a target trait. rong et al. constructed a genetic map including  <dig>  loci with  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers  <cit> . yu et al. published a genetic map with  <dig>  loci and  <dig>  cm in average marker distance  <cit> . yu et al. reported a genetic map containing  <dig>  loci with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . liang et al. reported an updated map consisting of  <dig>  loci with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . shi et al. constructed a genetic map with  <dig>  loci and  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers  <cit> . previously released genetic maps of gossypium have primarily been based on pcr-based markers, which are laborious, time consuming and gradually less effective because of saturation during high-density genetic map construction. since the application of high-throughput sequencing on cotton, marker density has been significantly increased. wang et al. constructed an ultra-dense genetic map consisting of  <dig> , <dig> snps distributed across  <dig>  cm, and these authors used their high-density genetic map for genome assembly of gossypium hirsutum acc. tm- <dig>  <cit> . wang et al. applied the rad-seq technique to upland cotton and identified  <dig>  snps based on the genome sequence of g. hirsutum tm- <dig>  they constructed a high-density genetic map comprising  <dig>  rad markers and  <dig> ssr markers and encompassing  <dig>  cm, with  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers  <cit> . hulse-kemp et al. constructed an ultra-high density genetic map using snp arrays for marker detection and constructed a high-density genetic map consisting of  <dig>  markers with  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers  <cit> . zhang et al. constructed a high-density genetic map that contained  <dig>  snps with an average marker density of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . thus, high-throughput sequencing techniques are more efficient.

to construct a satisfactory high-density genetic map for short-season cotton, we adopted rad-seq technology and developed  <dig>  polymorphic snps between the parents. polymorphisms between the parents reached  <dig>  %, which was much higher than the value for ssr markers . the genetic map, which contained  <dig>  simple snps and  <dig> ssr loci, spanned  <dig> .98 cm with an average of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers; this corresponds to a map length comparable to previous maps and a better marker density . the mapped markers were uniformly distributed along the  <dig> cotton chromosomes . the quality of our genetic map was evaluated by heat map analysis, which confirmed the accuracy of the  <dig> linkage groups because the recombination frequency among adjacent markers was relatively low . in addition, linkage information for the  <dig> ssr loci was validated by a comparison with genetic maps reported by liang et al.  <cit>  and blenda et al.  <cit> ; in particular, the distribution of loci in their maps confirmed the common-marker-based assignment of the  <dig> linkage groups in our study . most of the marker collinearity between the genetic map and the genome sequence was clear, thus illustrating that the markers were accurately located on the present genetic map and had sufficient coverage on the  <dig> chromosomes . our map is the first high-density genetic map for short-season cotton based on snp markers. in combination with the other published genetic maps described above, our map represents one of the most valuable resources available for cotton genome detection.fig.  <dig> marker collinearity between the genetic map and the reference genome. the x-axis indicates the arrangement of the  <dig> linkage groups ; the y-axis indicates the  <dig> reference chromosome sequences 




published genetic studies on cotton have given priority to fiber quality  <cit> , whereas few studies have focused on earliness. in this study, based on the high-density genetic map, we conducted qtl mapping for cotton earliness. the six studied traits were positively correlated with one another, which indicates the existence of gene pleiotropy or closely linked functional genes. this finding is consistent with the observation that more than half of detected qtls  were involved in qtl coincidence regions and that qtls in the same coincidence region were characterized by the same allelic direction ; this phenomenon reveals the possibility of synchronously improving several earliness-related traits. ft and fbp are two of the main components of the wgp; however, the qtls for these traits only partially coincided or overlapped. the same result was found between hnffb and ph, with hnffb is a primarily component of ph . these limited common coincidence regions indicate that these genes might be expressed constitutively throughout the whole growth period or within the whole plant. in addition, various genes likely function at different developmental stages or in different parts of the plant, with each stage or organ modifiable by the ectopic expression of specific genes. cotton earliness can therefore be specifically improved. and the needs of plants at different growth stages and environments must further be considered to support the most appropriate conditions for plant development.

previous studies detected earliness-related qtls distributed on almost all  <dig> cotton chromosomes . in particular, qtls for fbp, wgp, nffb, hnffb and ph were detected as follows: qtls for fbp on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a8/d <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> ; qtls for wgp on chromosomes a <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> ; qtls for nffb on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> ; qtls for hnffb on chromosomes a <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> ; and qtls for ph on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> . these results indicate that d <dig> contains qtls for fbp, wgp, nffb, hnffb and ph, which suggests that d <dig> is one of the chromosomes responsible for cotton earliness. because of limitations in marker density and useful genome information, however, the published qtls with large confidence intervals are not well understood and additional studies had not been reported prior to the present investigation. by analyzing the high-density genetic map, we identified more than  <dig> qtls, including  <dig> qtls on d <dig>  a stable qtl at  <dig>  cm, qft-d3- <dig>  was identified in six environments and coincided with another five qtls in the interval of  <dig> – <dig>  cm. this result demonstrates that this region may contain a critical gene tightly related to earliness . several other qtls were also detected upstream or downstream of this region . homozygous rils in this interval were clearly classifiable into two groups with different phenotypes. the first group, which inherited homozygous qtl alleles from the g <dig> cultivar, exhibited larger plant architectures and later flowering. the other group, which inherited alleles from the ccri <dig> cultivar, was characterized by smaller phenotypes and earlier flowering . on the basis of  <dig> recombinants in the ril population, we narrowed down the core interval to a region spanning approximately 2 mb between marker <dig> and marker <dig> . sixty-eight genes were annotated in this interval; one of them, emf <dig>  was regularly expressed among cultivars with different growth periods . at all four stages, emf <dig> displayed relatively low expression in ccri <dig> compared with shan <dig>  but showed the highest expression in bomian <dig> . earlier studies found that emf <dig> is involved in various pathways, including delayed flowering . we speculate that emf <dig> in cotton also has a major role in flowering. because of limitations related to population type or size, however, further pinpointing the candidate interval based on the 137-ril population will be difficult. new populations are consequently needed, such as near isogenic lines  and larger secondary f <dig> populations. and we plan to perform additional work involving on qtl fine mapping and functional verifications in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a high-density genetic map, the first snp-based map constructed for short-season cotton that will be useful for genetic studies of earliness. more than  <dig> qtls were detected and  <dig> qtl coincidence regions were analyzed; these results will provide useful materials for qtl fine mapping, gene positional cloning and mas. one gene, emf <dig>  was verified by qrt-pcr among three cultivars from 3- to 6-leaf developmental stages; the result demonstrated this gene is promising for further study. in addition, the approach used in this study, rad-seq is a powerful technique for snp detection in high-resolution genetic map construction with polyploidy species.
