BACKGROUND
ovine oviduct epithelial cells are effective barriers for microorganisms and actively participate in the initiation of innate host defense. unfortunately, salpingitis is the one of most common and serious infections in reproductive system diseases  <cit> . however, there has been a dramatic worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance in pathogens in the past several decades. thus, there is an urgent need to develop new and innovative, non-antibiotic approaches to prevent and manage this disease  <cit> . defensins are antimicrobial peptides of innate immunity functioning by non-specific binding to anionic phospholipids in bacterial membranes.

β-defensins are produced directly by epithelial cells, and combat infection both through direct microbicidal action and by modulation of cell-mediated immunity  <cit> . these peptides are involved in the innate immunity mechanisms and act directly against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, due to their bactericidal and cytotoxic activity  <cit> . moreover, they have been suggested as effector molecules in host defense, interacting with many target cells and tissues  <cit> . so far, only two β-defensin genes have been identified in sheep: β-defensin  <dig>  and β-defensin  <dig> , although genomic studies suggest more have yet to be discovered  <cit> . recent studies have revealed that the sbd- <dig> is an important component of the innate immune response of the ovine oviduct.

nonetheless, there is a paucity of information about the role and regulation of the expression of the oviduct sbd- <dig> gene in ovine and, in particular, whether e <dig> modulate its expression. in the present study, the expression of mrna sbd- <dig> was studied by a pcr  assay in oviduct epithelial cells treated with e <dig>  since previous studies have demonstrated that e <dig> provides a stimulus that may regulate defensins, this study investigated the effect of three pathways, pka, pkc and nf-κb, in sbd- <dig> expression by oviduct epithelial cultured cells.

RESULTS
e <dig> up-regulates sbd- <dig> expression in ovine oviduct epithelial cells
to find out whether e <dig> can increase expression of sbd- <dig> mrna in different concentrations and times, we treated ovine oviduct epithelial cells with different concentrations e <dig> and different times. figure 1c&d shows the kinetics of sbd- <dig> expression. as is evident from the figure, the induction of sbd- <dig> mrna expression was very rapid after the cells had been treated for  <dig> h and the greatest induction was observed at  <dig> h, which suggests that the highest expression levels were around  <dig> h. afterwards, although the up-regulation was continuing, the enhanced amplitude gradually decreased, and the lowest induction was at  <dig> h . besides, the concentration of 10- <dig> m provided the greatest induction at every time point except at  <dig> h, which suggests that the optimum concentration of e <dig> for the cells is 10- <dig> m . therefore, we treated the cells with e <dig>  to seek the time point of the greatest induction of sbd- <dig> expression. figure 1e shows that the greatest induction of sbd- <dig> expression was observed at  <dig>  h and the induction of sbd- <dig> expression has significant differences from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h. the change of sbd- <dig> expression level was especially prevalent between  <dig>  to  <dig>  h.

sbd- <dig> expression was mediated through gpr <dig> and ers activation in ovine oviduct epithelial cells
recent studies showed that activation of gpr <dig> and ers controls estrogen-responsiveness  <cit> . therefore, to further investigate a possible role of gpr <dig> and ers activation for e2-dependent sbd- <dig> expression, we pre-incubated ovine oviduct epithelial cells with the high-affinity agonist g <dig> for gpr <dig> and the inhibitor ici  <dig>  to prevent ers bind with e <dig>  as shown in figure 2a&c, treatment of cells with e <dig> and g <dig> resulted in sbd- <dig> expression increasing from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h and the effect is not obvious from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h. inhibiting ers activation inhibited the sbd- <dig> expression  in e2-treated cells from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h, whereas sbd- <dig> expression increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h . our data demonstrated that activation of gpr <dig> and ers by e <dig> was important for sbd- <dig> expression in ovine oviduct epithelial cells.

the pka, pkc and nf-κbpathways were essential in e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expression
having demonstrated that the greatest induction was observed at  <dig>  h in e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expression, we went on to elucidate the pathway by which signal was transduced to the nucleus. based on the putative mechanisms of estrogen action  <cit> ,we tested the hypothesis that the pka, pkc and nf-κb pathways might be essential in e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expression using pka inhibitor h- <dig>  pkc inhibitor h- <dig> and nf-κb inhibitor pdtc. figure  <dig> shows that the sbd- <dig> expression was significantly reduced when treated with inhibitor or inhibitors with no difference compared to the control group.

discussion
antimicrobial innate immune molecules produced by the epithelial cells provide the host with a constitutive or immediately inducible defense mechanism against invading pathogens  <cit> . meanwhile, non-inflamed tubal and middle ear mucosa have been shown to contain relatively few immunocytes  <cit> . furthermore, because of the under-developed and premature adaptive immune system in young animals, the role of aiims in protecting against pathogens becomes important. this suggests that aiims protect the body during the neonatal and early postnatal periods when the adaptive immunity is not yet fully developed.

among the aiims, defensins and cathelicidins are the dominant antimicrobial peptides found in neutrophils and epithelia as components of the early host defenses of mammals against infection, and these peptides have potent microbicidal activity against prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens as well as viruses  <cit> . the expression of defensin in epithelial cells is mediated by certain hormones and is closely related to estrogenic hormone and progesterone  <cit> . this suggests that e <dig> might be important in the modulation of ovine defensin expression in ovine oviduct epithelial cells. however, there is little information on how the e <dig> regulates the expression of defensins in ovine oviduct epithelial cells by e <dig> 

we demonstrate that the gene of sbd- <dig> was expressed in ovine oviduct epithelial cells through the rt-pcr analysis and sequencing. in addition, using qpcr, there was a single peak in every dissociation curve , and the amplification efficiencies of sbd- <dig> and β-actin were  <dig>  and  <dig> . meanwhile, both slopes were − <dig> . based on this we also demonstrated that e <dig> could up-regulate the expression of sbd- <dig>  especially when treated with 10- <dig> m e <dig> . the mechanism by which e <dig> induces or activates the expression of sbd- <dig> is not precisely understood, but our data showed that the expression of sbd- <dig> still occurs in ovine oviduct epithelial cells left untreated. therefore, e <dig> may be not necessary for the expression of sbd- <dig> but nay rather play a role as a promoting factor. moreover, after stimulation with e <dig> at 10- <dig> m, the effect continued for at least  <dig> h  and peaked at  <dig>  h, while, the highest expression level had been sustained for  <dig> h from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h . this data suggests that the expression was activated and reached it’s highest level simultaneously, but only for a short time, after which time it continued as a reduced-level, which was still much higher compared with the non-treated control. this shows that there might be a fast pathway, which could be activated quickly, in the expression of sbd- <dig> by e <dig> 

previous studies have suggested that the putative mechanisms of estrogen action have two mechanisms: a non classical genomic mechanism and a classical genomic mechanism. meanwhile, gpr <dig> and ers might play important roles in the two mechanisms  <cit> . based on these results, we investigated the role and identity of gpr <dig> and ers in the modulation of sbd- <dig> expression by e <dig> in ovine oviduct epithelial cells. we noted that the expression increased after addition of e <dig> and g <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h and with no change in the e <dig> only treatment from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h . meanwhile, after addition of e <dig> and ici  <dig> , the expression diminished quickly from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h , however, the expression increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  h . this is consistent with the fact that ici  <dig>  is also an agonist at the membrane estrogen receptor gpr <dig>  <cit> . these results suggest that e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> mrna expression was dependent on gpr <dig> and ers in ovine oviduct epithelial cells at different times. gpr <dig> plays an important role in non classical genomic mechanism, activating rapid pathways, while ers acts with a classical genomic mechanism controlling gene transcription.

in the non classical genomic mechanism, the camp/pka pathways  <cit> , pkc pathway  <cit>  and nf-κb pathway  <cit>  play important roles in the putative mechanisms of estrogen action  <cit> . our data showed that there was almost no difference between the untreated and treated cells, which were added with the inhibitors of h- <dig>  h- <dig>  and pdtc either individually or in combination for  <dig>  h . these results suggest that the three pathways were indispensable for the expression of sbd- <dig> by e <dig> in ovine oviduct epithelial cells. furthermore, we also conclude that the three pathways should be activated simultaneously, or otherwise there would be no effect on the e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we found that in ovine oviduct epithelial cells e2-induced up-regulation of sbd- <dig> expression was gpr30-dependent during prophase and ers-dependent during later-stage. expression of sbd- <dig> included activation of the camp/pka pathway, pkc pathway and nf-κb pathway via the non classical genomic mechanism, whereas the precondition that all three pathways were activated simultaneously was essential for this process. since control of the immune response is crucial to prevent excessive tissue damage and to assure bacterial clearance in salpingitis, the mechanism described above could be important for the host defense in the ovine oviduct.
