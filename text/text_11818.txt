BACKGROUND
prediction of protein structure from amino-acid sequences has been one of the most challenging problems in computational structural biology for many years  <cit> . historically, protein structure prediction was classified into three categories:  comparative modeling  <cit> ,  threading  <cit> , and  ab initio folding  <cit> . the first two approaches build protein models by aligning query sequences onto solved template structures. when close templates are identified, high-resolution models could be built by the template-based methods. if templates are absent from the protein data bank  library, the models need to be built from scratch, i.e. ab initio folding. this is the most difficult category of protein-structure prediction  <cit> .

with increasing protein sizes, the conformational phase space of sampling also sharply increases, which makes the ab initio modeling of larger proteins extremely difficult  <cit> . current ab initio predictions are mainly focused on small proteins. several successful examples have been reported in literature. for example, based on an ab initio approach designed to globally optimize their potential energy function, liwo et al were able to build models of cα root mean square deviation  to native < 6Å for protein fragments of up to  <dig> residues  <cit> . using the rosetta program  <cit> , simon et al reported  <dig> successful structure predictions out of  <dig> target proteins with lengths of <  <dig> residues, with cα-rmsd < 7Å in the top five models  <cit> . using touchstone-ii software, zhang et al reported  <dig> foldable cases from  <dig> target proteins  with cα-rmsd <  <dig> Å in the top five models  <cit> . recently, bradley et al demonstrated an exciting achievement by building several high-resolution models for proteins of <  <dig> residues  <cit> . by combining low-resolution and high-resolution sampling, the authors used the all-atomic rosetta to predict high-resolution models with cα-rmsd <  <dig> Å for  <dig> of  <dig> small proteins. the average cα-rmsd for all the  <dig> proteins was  <dig> Å in the best of the top five clusters. the cpu time cost, however, is expensive and ~ <dig> cpu days are required for the all-atom sampling of each target.

in this work, we aimed to investigate the possibility of generating high-resolution models of small proteins in an automated and fast simulation. we developed a new method, i-tasser, which implements tasser  <cit>  in an iterative mode and also exploits new force-field optimization and fragment identification. we tested the i-tasser method on three independent benchmark sets. the result shows that i-tasser has a comparable overall performance with the all-atomic rosetta but with far lower cpu cost. it also demonstrates that i-tasser clearly outperforms the touchstone-ii method.

RESULTS
we tested the folding performance of i-tasser on small proteins. to avoid contamination with homologous proteins, any template with > 20% sequence identity to the target sequence was removed from our template library. moreover, if a template could be detected by the position specific iterative -blast program with an e-value <  <dig> , it would also be excluded. we note that the homology exclusion cutoff used here is more stringent than that used by bradley et al  <cit> , who only excluded templates with a psi-blast e-value <  <dig>  but without sequence identity cutoff, and that used by zhang et al  <cit> , who only excluded the templates with sequence identity > 30% but without psi-blast checking. in the sense that all homologous templates had been completely excluded, we termed the corresponding simulations "ab initio" modeling, following the notation by others  <cit> .

for the evaluation of the predicted models, we used both the rmsd and tm-score  <cit> . although rmsd can give an explicit concept of modeling errors, in some cases, a local error  can cause a large rmsd value even though the global topology is correct. tm-score is defined as  <cit> .

benchmark i:  <dig> proteins from the data of bradley et al
for the first predicted model of the highest cluster density, the overall average cα-rmsd for the  <dig> target proteins was  <dig> Å with average tm-score of  <dig> . if we consider the best model in the top five predictions, the average cα-rmsd to the native is  <dig> Å and tm-score was  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows typical examples of both medium-resolution and low-resolution predicted models.

as a comparison, the table also lists the all-atomic rosseta predictions for the  <dig> proteins . rosetta predicted more high-resolution models than i-tasser does. rosetta had three models <  <dig> Å in round  <dig>  four models in round  <dig>  and two models in the top five clusters. the difference in the number of high-resolution models may indicate the resolution limitation of the reduced potential used in i-tasser modeling. however, rosetta had more low-resolution models than did i-tasser. if we define low-resolution models as those with a cα-rmsd > 5Å, rosetta had seven low-resolution models in round  <dig>  five low-resolution models in round  <dig>  and four low-resolution models in the best of the top five clusters. i-tasser had only three low-resolution models in the best of the top five clusters. the overall average cα-rmsd of the best of the top five i-tasser models is  <dig> Å, comparable with that of rosetta . the statistical equivalency of these two methods was at the 5% significance level under the wilcoxon rank sum test based on cα-rmsd. however, the cpu time cost by i-tasser was much shorter . the main reason for the cpu saving might be that i-tasser operates under reduced modeling, whereas the rosetta modeling is at an atomic level. the simulations on multiple homologous sequences also increase the computing time for rosetta  <cit> .

benchmark ii:  <dig> proteins from zhang et al
in this benchmark set, we took  <dig> proteins from the data of zhang et al  <cit> : six α-proteins, six β-proteins, and eight αβ-proteins, with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. these  <dig> proteins were selected so that they and the proteins used in benchmark i had pairwise sequence identity of < 30%.

as shown in table  <dig>  in this benchmark set, most of the targets had medium resolution, with cα-rmsd to native of  <dig> –5Å by i-tasser. more specifically, for the best of the top five clusters,  <dig> targets had medium resolution,  <dig> targets had low resolution, and  <dig> target  had high resolution. typical examples from the three categories are shown in figure  <dig>  the comparisons of the final models with the initial threading alignments are shown in figure  <dig> . again, the global topology of the final models was significantly closer to the native structure than were the threading alignments. the average cα-rmsd and tm-score of the initial threading alignments were  <dig> Å and  <dig>  respectively, but after i-tasser simulations, they improved to  <dig> Å and  <dig> .

compared with the touchstone-ii modeling  <cit> , i-tasser predicted better models in  <dig> cases, with lower cα-rmsd in the best of the top  <dig> clusters. only in three cases did i-tasser models have slightly higher cα-rmsd, i.e. 1bq9a , 256ba , and 2pcy_ . the overall average cα-rmsd results for the touchstone-ii and i-tasser models were  <dig> Å and  <dig> Å respectively. statistically, the result of i-tasser was better than that of touchstone-ii at the 1% significance level using the wilcoxon rank sum test.

the algorithm of touchstone-ii was previously developed in our group, and searches for protein conformations on a cubic lattice system. each residue in touchstone-ii is represented by its cα, cβ, and the side-chain center of mass . the force field consists of a variety of knowledge-based statistical potentials from pdb and the side-chain contact restraints predicted by prospector_ <dig>  <cit> . in tasser  <cit> , we assemble the protein models directly using the continuous fragments from the prospector_ <dig> alignment, in which the conformations are searched in an "on-and-off" lattice system, i.e. the threading-aligned regions are modeled off-lattice and the unaligned loop regions on-lattice. each residue is represented by the cα and the side-chain center of mass . the force field was developed from touchstone-ii, with new potentials including the sequence-specified pair-wise potential  <cit> , cα distance correlations from sequence-specific fragments  <cit> , and the more accurate secondary structure-specified hydrogen bonding  <cit> . the force field of i-tasser is mainly developed from that of touchstone-ii and tasser. the new components in i-tasser include:  the new neural network hydrophobic potential as described in equation  <dig> in the methods section and the decoy-based reparameterization of all weight-factors based on target categories;  the development of the new ppa threading program, which provides different assembly fragments and restraints; and  the two-step iterative refinement simulations. for conformational sampling, the introduction of the on-and-off lattice fragment assembly simulation in tasser and i-tasser is the key factor to speed up the search of important phase spaces because the usage of rigid-body fragments dramatically reduces the entropy of the searched space. the modeling improvement data shown in table  <dig> demonstrates the progress of i-tasser in both potentials and sampling since touchstone-ii  <cit> .

benchmark iii:  <dig> non-homologous small proteins selected from the pdb
for the testing of the generality of i-tasser folding on small proteins, we constructed the third benchmark proteins directly from the pdb library. as listed in table  <dig>  this set includes seven α-proteins, six β-proteins, and seven αβ-proteins, with lengths ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> residues. to avoid the redundancy of the benchmarks, the proteins were selected so that this set and the previously used  <dig> target proteins had sequence identity between all the pairs of < 30%. the proteins were randomly taken from pdb, but the targets with unusual topology  were excluded.

the average cα-rmsd of the best in top five models by i-tasser was  <dig> Å , which was similar to that of benchmarks i and ii. again, there was one model  with a high-resolution prediction, as presented in figure 2g. there were  <dig> medium-resolution predictions and  <dig> low-resolution ones. the typical examples from these two categories are shown in figure  <dig>  the global topology of the final models was also markedly closer to the native structure than the threading alignments, as shown in figure  <dig> . overall, the model quality and the cα-rmsd distribution in this independent set was comparable with the benchmark sets taken from bradley et al  <cit>  and zhang et al  <cit> , which demonstrates the robustness and stability of the i-tasser modeling on ab initio small-protein folding. the i-tasser method was also tested in recent blind casp <dig> experiments  <cit> , where the overall tm-score of the i-tasser models was significantly better than that of all other automated methods .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have developed a new approach to protein structure modeling by iteratively implementing the tasser method. meanwhile, we have introduced a new profile-profile alignment approach for the i-tasser fragment collection, and a new neural network-trained hydrophobic potential, which has been implemented in a reduced monte carlo simulation for the first time.

the benchmark proteins were taken from three independent sources, in which any solved structure that had a sequence identity of > 20% to the targets and could be detected by psi-blast with an e-value of <  <dig>  was removed from the template library.

the i-tasser folding showed comparable overall results with the all-atomic rosetta simulation, especially in the medium-resolution region. it is noteworthy that, even with reduced modeling, the current i-tasser has the capacity to generate high-resolution models, although the frequency of high-resolution cases was lower than that of the all-atomic rosetta. further development of the atomic potential for the i-tasser might be helpful in increasing the modeling accuracy in the high-resolution region, but it would certainly increase the cpu cost of i-tasser. currently, the average cpu time for small proteins is about  <dig> cpu hours for i-tasser, whereas the cpu cost for the atomic rosetta modeling is  <dig> cpu days per target.

the i-tasser modeling results obviously outperform those generated by touchstone-ii  <cit> , with the average cα-rmsd reducing from  <dig> Å to  <dig> Å for the same protein set. as the sequence identity cutoff used here was more stringent than that used by touchstone-ii, the improvement demonstrates the progress of i-tasser in both force field and conformational sampling.

although the benchmark proteins were taken from different sources, the overall performance of i-tasser was very similar. for the first predicted models, the average cα-rmsd ranged from  <dig> Å to  <dig> Å and the average tm-score ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the three benchmarks. for the best models in the top five predictions, the average cα-rmsd ranged from  <dig> Å to  <dig> Å and the average tm-score ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this modeling stability, along with the consistent results from i-tasser server in the "free modeling" section of the recent casp <dig> experiment, demonstrates the robustness of i-tasser method in predicting correct folds for small proteins. meanwhile, the capacity of generating medium-resolution to high-resolution models using reduced modeling represents new progress in the field of ab initio modeling.
