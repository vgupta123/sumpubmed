BACKGROUND
the vast majority of animal phyla live in the ocean and develop via small ciliated larvae that form part of the zooplankton  <cit> . these larvae, called ‘primary larvae’ , are equipped with sensory cells to perceive various stimuli including light, touch and chemical cues  <cit> . simple nervous systems integrate sensory information and control ciliary locomotion  <cit> . most conspicuously, an ‘apical organ’ is found in various groups, including cnidarians  <cit> , protostome annelids, mollusks  <cit> , flatworms  <cit>  and nemertines  <cit> , as well as deuterostome echinoderms  <cit>  and hemichordates  <cit> . these groups belong to the neuralia   <cit> . apical organs are often equipped with an ‘apical tuft’ of long cilia and include a small set of sensory-neurosecretory cell types  <cit> . as shown for cnidarians, mollusks and annelids, apical organs play a role in the control of settlement  <cit> , facilitating the integration of multimodal sensory input and the coordination of effector cells. development involving primary larvae  is referred to as ‘indirect’; if it does not involve a larval stage, it is referred to as ‘direct’  <cit> .

widespread occurrence of ciliated larvae, with similar overall body plans, has prompted radically different views regarding their evolutionary significance  <cit> . while some authors consider them an ancient feature of the metazoan life cycle  <cit> , others assume that they evolved multiple times independently  <cit>  . in the past two decades, studies of developmental genes involved in setting up the larval body plan have started to provide a new source of comparative data to resolve these conflicting views. these studies have revealed specific similarities such as the expression of the goosecoid and brachyury genes in foregut, midline and hindgut of lophotrochozoan and deuterostome larvae  <cit>  . also, the ciliary bands characteristic for swimming larvae were found to specifically express otx and three conserved micrornas in lophotrochozoans and deuterostomes, corroborating the homology of shared larval features  <cit> . conversely, dissimilar expression reported for nk <dig>  and hnf <dig> in the apical plate of sea urchins and the episphere of abalone larvae  <cit>  raised doubt regarding the common origin of similar shared larval features. however, these pioneering studies thus far relied on small gene sets.

more recently, an extended set of transcription factors has been shown to play a conserved role in patterning the larval body plan in hemichordate  <cit>  and in sea urchin  <cit> , belonging to the deuterostomes, and in the sea anemone nematostella vectensis, a cnidarian  <cit> . these factors respond to the differential stabilization of β-catenin along the primary body axis, triggered by wnt signaling  <cit> . in particular, six <dig> and foxq <dig> have been shown to negatively respond to wnt signaling in a complex sequence of patterning events  <cit> . these factors specify apical territory around the apical pole  <cit> . for the first time, the conserved regional expression of similar sets of transcription factors provides a molecular framework for the comparison of larval cell types and tissues and thus important clues to larval body plan and apical organ evolution.

in our current study, we investigated the apical patterning system in the marine annelid platynereis dumerilii <cit> , a lophotrochozoan protostome with a canonical biphasic pelago-benthic life cycle . we examined the set of transcription factors involved in apical patterning, including six <dig> and foxq <dig>  in the episphere of the platynereis trochophore larva and have shown that, as in deuterostomes and cnidarians, expression of these factors is sensitive to wnt signaling. we found that the apical organ develops in a small central territory devoid of six <dig> expression, that instead expresses a number of other factors, many of which are found in the same location in other neuralians. by expression profiling, we molecularly characterized several cell types that form part of the apical organ in platynereis, which we compared to apical organ cell types described for other animal groups.

our results reveal that the larvae of cnidarians, protostomes and deuterostomes exhibit extensive similarity in the molecular topography of body regions around the apical organ, which we use to genetically define ‘apical plate’ and ‘apical organ’; the specification of these regions by a conserved apical signaling system; and the molecular fingerprint of a subset of apical organ cell types. these findings support homology of some primitive type of apical organ  in neuralia and are most consistent with an early and unique origin of animal larval forms .

RESULTS
molecular topography of the apical region
in the sea urchin  <cit> , the hemichordate saccoglossus kowalevskii <cit>  and the anthozoan cnidarian nematostella <cit> , expression of the transcription factors six <dig> and foxq <dig> demarcates the most apical body region. in saccoglossus and nematostella, the six3+, foxq2+ domain is peripherally overlapping with a ring of rx and bounded by even more peripheral rings of otx and otp expression  <cit> . likewise, fezf is expressed in the apical plate in sea urchin  <cit>  and the hemichordate  <cit> . we have previously shown that six <dig> is expressed in a large contiguous domain of the platynereis episphere  <cit> , peripherally overlapping with the expression of rx <cit> .

building on this, we set out to further refine the molecular topography of the platynereis larval episphere. we found that, in platynereis, the newly characterized foxq <dig> expression demarcated the ‘upper’ two thirds of the episphere , largely overlapping with that of six <dig> . we refer to this six3+, foxq2+ region as apical plate, in accordance with classical nomenclature for spiralian trochophore larvae . expression of the newly characterized fezf  and that of rx  overlapped that of six <dig> and foxq <dig> peripherally . more peripherally, in the ‘lower’ third of the episphere, we detected expression of otx   <cit> , partially overlapping with that of rx dorsally and that of fezf ventrally. even more peripherally, expression of the otp gene   <cit>  demarcated the ciliary band, called the prototroch.

the platynereis episphere can thus be subdivided into a sequence of molecular regions, arranged in concentric rings from apical to peripheral . this overall sequence matches the molecular topography observed in deuterostomes and cnidarians . another conserved feature of apical patterning in sea urchin  <cit> , saccoglossus <cit>  and again in platynereis <cit>  is expression of nk <dig>  in an apical-ventral territory , overlapping six <dig>  in sea urchin, this domain includes cells positive for onecut   <cit> , and we found that, in platynereis, expression of the same genes covers cells located ventromedially at a similar distance to the apical tuft cells , which indicates co-expression. this is important because the two genes were shown to comprise non-overlapping domains in the apical region of the red abalone haliotis .

the platynereis trochophore also shares expression features with cnidarian and deuterostome larvae specific to the developing apical organ. in sea urchin  <cit> , nematostella and platynereis, the apical tuft and a girdle of cells surrounding the tuft are devoid of six <dig> expression . in platynereis, the six3-free region extends into a dorsal patch of cells that becomes separated from the central patch by a band of six3+ cells . inside the six3-free region, we detect restricted expression of several transcription factors : otp , nkx <dig> , foxj  and hox <dig> . in addition, the irx gene is expressed in the dorsal patch of cells devoid of six <dig> expression . notably, nkx <dig> <cit> , foxj <cit> , the hox gene paralog anthox <dig> <cit>  and irx <cit>  are also expressed in the apical region devoid of six <dig> in nematostella; foxj matches the region devoid of six <dig> expression in sea urchin  <cit>  and apical irx expression has been documented in hemichordates, although broader than in annelids  <cit> . an apical region devoid of six <dig> expression, ‘filled’ by the restricted expression of foxj, nkx <dig>  hox and irx, thus represents a larval-specific transcription factor signature that molecularly defines the apical organ in several distinct, phylogenetically remote neuralian groups such as anemone and annelid  and lends strong support to its evolutionary conservation .

functional studies have demonstrated the role of fibroblast growth factor , transforming growth factor  and wnt signaling in apical plate patterning. for example, fgf signaling controls formation of the apical organ in sea anemone  <cit> ; the apical plate of sea urchins is patterned by tgfβ signaling  <cit>  and fgfr <dig> localizes to the apical plate during apical organ formation  <cit> . similarly, the platynereis apical organ region showed specific expression of fgfr in a highly restricted population of cells . we also found an apically restricted domain of the tgfβ signaling antagonist noggin in cells devoid of six <dig> expression , which indicates that both signaling systems also play a role in apical patterning in platynereis. notably, expression of noggin has also been reported for the six3-free apical organ in sea anemone  <cit> . consistent with a prominent role of wnt signaling in platynereis apical patterning, we detected the wnt receptor molecule frizzled5/ <dig> in a broad apical domain  and sfrp, which plays a conserved role in antagonizing wnt signaling in deuterostomes  <cit> , specifically in the apical organ region . furthermore, we detected early expression of wnt <dig> in ventral peripheral episphere regions, outside of  the six <dig> domain, consistent with a role in apical patterning . wnt <dig> is one example of a wnt paralog expressed at the right stage and location in developing nematostella <cit>  and amphioxus  <cit>  to be involved in patterning along the primary axis; yet, in the absence of specific knockdown or knockout data, no case for the specific involvement of wnt <dig> can be made. note that none of the many wnts expressed in platynereis larvae  <cit>  appears to be expressed in the six3+ apical plate, in line with repression of wnt signaling being a pre-requisite for apical specification to occur, a notion that we set out to test further experimentally.

ectopic wnt signaling abolishes specification of the apical organ region
in deuterostome larvae such as sea urchin and saccoglossus, as well as in the cnidarian nematostella, the expression of apical markers such as foxq <dig> and six <dig> critically depends on levels of active wnt signaling  <cit> . activation of canonical wnt signaling via chemical inhibition of gsk3β via li + and/or paullone treatment in sea urchins  <cit> , hemichordates  <cit>  and cnidarians  <cit>  results in the loss of apical ectodermal markers. conversely, degradation of nuclear β-catenin in sea urchin leads to expansion of apical ectodermal genes including nk <dig> , foxq <dig>  six <dig>  rx and fgfr <cit> , indicating that wnt-mediated antagonism of apical plate markers plays a role in the development of apical territories in deuterostome and cnidarian larvae. to test the role of wnt signaling in apical patterning in platynereis larvae, we exposed early trochophores to azakenpaullone, a selective inhibitor of gsk3β  <cit>  that has been shown to trigger nuclear β-catenin accumulation in platynereis, mimicking ectopic activation of wnt signaling  <cit> . we found that azakenpaullone specifically knocked down or abolished apical expression of episphere markers, including the broadly expressed six <dig>  and foxq <dig>  in a concentration-dependent manner, with the majority of expression reduced or lost between 1 μm and 5 μm . conversely, the expression of pax <dig>  which occupies a more ventral peripheral position in the larval episphere  <cit>  , was expanded at  <dig>  μm to 10 μm concentrations of azakenpaullone . the number of otp + apical organ cells was also reduced at higher concentrations of azakenpaullone , with all cells absent at  <dig> and 10 μm concentrations. by contrast, the expression of hox <dig> in the apical tuft cells persisted at all concentrations . this may have been because tuft cells are among the first cells to differentiate in the apical plate . to test the dynamic role of wnt signaling in episphere patterning, we conducted washout experiments in azakenpaullone-treated embryos . following washout at 24 hours, embryos were assessed at 30 hours post-fertilization  for recovery of gene expression. we saw moderate recovery in the expression of foxq <dig> and six <dig> as well as a slight restriction of pax <dig>  but no change in the number and location of otp + cells. we attribute the moderate recovery in expression to the determinate lineage of platynereis larvae, in which stereotyped divisions may result in a restricted fate potential very early in development. taken together, our data indicate that in platynereis as in deuterostome larvae, the transcription factors defining the molecular identity of apical body regions, of which six <dig> and foxq <dig> form core components, are opposed by a wnt-dependent signaling center.

morphological and molecular characterization of apical organ cell types
light and electron optic studies have revealed cell types that make up the apical organs of different invertebrate larval groups  <cit> . in platynereis, the apical tuft was visible by  <dig> hpf  and other apical organ cells were likewise post-mitotic by  <dig> hpf , expressing markers indicative of neuronal differentiation. at  <dig> hpf, several apical cell types were fully morphologically differentiated . we found that the apical tuft was formed by two basket-shaped cells with intracellular tubulin support structures ; cells with a very similar morphology, referred to as ampullary cells, have previously been described in mollusk larvae  <cit> . these cells persisted deep in the medial brain at later stages in the center of a massive commissural and neurosecretory neuropil , and may thus represent a structural organizing center for the juvenile nervous system, as suggested for other polychaete larvae  <cit> . dorsal to the ampullary tuft cells, we found another set of large cells with multiple motile cilia in a crescent-moon shape, known as crescent cells . two serotonergic cells have also been found in the apical organ region by  <dig> hpf  <cit> . closest to the tuft was a serotonergic interneuron  lacking sensory dendrites. this cell was located deep in the epithelium, adjacent to an assembly of previously described sensory-neurosecretory flask-shaped cells  that, morphologically, resemble chemosensory cells  <cit>  . more ventral to the parampullary cells, we detected a median pair of cells bearing short, stiff and curly sensory cilia resembling mechanoreceptors .

these distinctive morphologies, in conjunction with the recently established profiling by image registration  technique, enabled us to assign a molecular fingerprint to these cells, providing them with unique molecular identities  <cit> . primr utilizes the stereotyped development of the platynereis axonal scaffold to generate in silico alignments of mrna in situ expression patterns, and allows single cell co-expression analyses to be conducted  <cit> . of a collection of  <dig> genes currently available for primr single cell co-expression analysis,  <dig> were differentially expressed in cells of the apical organ region in the  <dig> hpf larva. additional file 1: figure s <dig> details the primr-based co-expression analysis for the above-mentioned morphologically identifiable cells, namely the ventral-most serotoninergic cell , the parampullary sensory-neurosecretory cells , the ampullary tuft cell , the crescent cells  and the pair of putative mechanoreceptors .

primr revealed unique sets of genes expressed by each of these cell types, in line with their specialized sensory-neurosecretory and neuronal characteristics. for example, as determined previously, the flask-shaped parampullary cells expresses otp , mir- <dig>  and prohormone convertase  <dig>   <cit> . beyond that, primr allowed cellular allocation of transcripts encoding neuropeptide precursors for dlamide, fmrfamide and wldamide , consistent with a conserved role of otp in specifying different types of peptidergic cells  <cit> . these three neuropeptides mediate opposing effects on locomotor behavior with dlamide and fmrfamide exposure leading to an increase and wldamide leading to a decrease in ciliary beating frequency  <cit> . the otp + peptidergic cells also expressed mip, the recently described settlement-inducing neuropeptide  <cit> . in addition, we found that all otp + sensory-neurosecretory cells were positive for the newly identified peropsin gene , an opsin-related photopigment that may function as photopigment or photoisomerase  <cit> , indicating that these cells  are light-sensitive. complementing this, we observed that the previously characterized c-opsin <dig> <cit> , an ortholog of rhodopsin and other c-opsins, was expressed in cells around the apical organ . as c-opsin <dig> expression is difficult to score in  <dig> hpf larvae , we were not able to further characterize the c-opsin1+ cells. one of the otp + cells was demarcated by the expression of lmx1ab  and by position correlates to the serotonergic interneuron . the ampullary apical tuft cells  specifically expressed hox <dig>  and a trpv channel previously implicated to serve mechanosensory roles in other protostomes   <cit> , indicative of multiple sensory modalities. finally, and consistent with their specialized morphology, the two putative mechanosensory cells  expressed mir- <dig> , a conserved microrna that demarcates chemo- and mechanosensory cells across bilaterians  <cit> . furthermore, they were the only cells to express otx .

hierarchical clustering reveals distinct groups of apical organ cells
in line with our observation that at  <dig> hpf the apical organ region including the tuft cells was devoid of six <dig> expression, the tuft cells themselves and the directly ventrally adjacent sensory-neurosecretory and serotoninergic cells were six3-negative at  <dig> hpf. by contrast, the crescent and mechanoreceptor cells expressed six <dig> and thus, by molecular identity, appear to represent differentiated cell types of the surrounding apical plate. hierarchical clustering based on the  <dig> hpf primr data  supports this distinction: one cluster comprised the flask-shaped sensory-neurosecretory cells and the adjacent serotoninergic cell, which, in addition to the absence of six <dig> and presence of otp, mir- <dig> and phc <dig> , expressed carboxypeptidase-e  and other genes not directly linked to neurosecretion, such as smad2/ <dig>  this cluster corresponded to the otp + cells devoid of six <dig> expression at  <dig> hpf . another well-supported cluster comprised the crescent cells and the putative mechanosensory cells, which, in addition to six <dig>  expressed the microrna mir- <dig> , the ctbl <dig> and bzip.tf genes encoding transcription factors of unknown function, and tektin- <dig>  a structural component of microtubules  <cit> . note that in our clustering, absence and presence of six <dig> and foxq <dig> strictly correlated, indicative of co-regulation  <cit>  .

the ampullary tuft cells devoid of six <dig>  exhibited a more separate identity with equal distance to either cluster. with the six +  mechanosensory and crescent cells, they shared expression of foxj, which plays a role in the formation of long motile cilia  <cit> , and of three micrornas of the ‘ciliary’ group that have previously been found to demarcate locomotory ciliary bands across bilateria  <cit> . they shared the expression of the transcription chx <dig> with the peptidergic cells .

discussion
evolutionary conservation of apical patterning
we detected strong similarities in molecular topography around the apical organ of ciliated larvae in protostomes, deuterostomes and cnidarians that we interpret as common heritage. it is highly unlikely that a specific and partially nested pattern involving at least nine transcription factors  evolves convergently twice. the core of this pattern that is shared between all neuralians appears to be the apical co-expression of two factors, six <dig> and foxq <dig>  in sea urchin  <cit> , hemichordate  <cit> , annelid , brachiopod  <cit> , sea anemone  <cit>  and hydrozoan  <cit> . in sea urchin and spiralian larvae, these factors demarcate the apical plate and we propose to expand this term to the six3+, foxq2+ region of all neuralian primary larvae, which should be universally referred to as the apical plate . more peripherally, the apical plate co-expresses rx, as demonstrated here for the annelid but as also found in the sea anemone  <cit>  and hemichordate  <cit>  .  in all neuralians investigated, the specification of the apical plate is sensitive to wnt signaling, in that pharmacological activation of wnt signaling abolishes the expression of six <dig>  foxq <dig> and of other apical markers . the gene regulatory network establishing six <dig> and foxq <dig> expression is only beginning to be elucidated and appears to commonly involve activation of foxq <dig> by six <dig> <cit> . in bilaterians, the apical plate also appears to peripherally co-express fezf  and ventrally nk <dig>  and hnf6/onecut .

notably, although the six3+, foxq2+, rx+, fezf+, nk <dig> , onecut + apical plate, as defined here, is a larval character, the same genes are also co-expressed in bilaterian phyla that have lost the primary larva, such as insects and vertebrates, where they specify anterior brain regions  <cit> . this is consistent with previous observations that, after platynereis metamorphosis, apical plate markers remain expressed and demarcate the developing cerebral ganglia of the adult nervous system  <cit> . therefore, while the stereotypical, partially overlapping co-expression of the above-mentioned genes can be used to topographically ‘align’ larval body plans, it is not a unique feature of primary ciliated larvae.

a universal molecular definition of the apical organ region
the apical organ develops in the center of the apical plate. in annelid, sea urchin  <cit>  and sea anemone  <cit> , this apical organ region is specifically excluded from the region of six <dig> expression  and cnidarian   <cit> ). instead, it expresses the transcription factors foxj , nkx <dig>  and sea anemone  <cit> ), irx  and sea anemone  <cit> ) and a hox paralog , mollusk  <cit>  and sea anemone  <cit> ). note that all of these factors are also expressed elsewhere; for example, in platynereis, foxj is expressed in other six3+ ciliated apical plate cells and, more generally, in ciliary bands; nkx <dig> is expressed in other apical plate cells  and in segmented mesoderm  <cit>  and hox <dig> is expressed in the second larval segment  <cit>  - nevertheless, the recurrent appearance of these factors in the apical organ region across neuralians appears highly significant and we propose that it reflects the evolutionary conservation of apical organ cell types . in addition, apical organ formation appears to similarly depend on local fgf signaling, as shown for sea anemone  <cit>  and as suggested by localization of the fgf receptor to the apical plate, in sea urchin  <cit>  and annelid . also, the common localization of tgfβ signaling inhibitor noggin to the apical organ, as seen in sea anemone  <cit> , sea urchin and in platynereis, is indicative of conserved signaling events. together, these transcription factors and signaling molecules provide a highly characteristic molecular signature for the apical organ region . given that the establishment of the six3-‘hole’ spatially correlates with, and has been functionally linked to, the formation of the apical tuft , we consider this signature a characteristic feature of primary larvae and its apparent evolutionary conservation lends strong support to the notion that these larvae represent an ancient feature of the metazoan life cycle . it will be interesting to determine to what extent this signature or parts of this signature are present in groups that have lost primary larvae; given the spotted appearance of irx, nkx <dig>  hox and foxj expression in the apical organ region it is likely that any conservation of this signature at adult stages would relate to the persistence of ‘apical’ cell types throughout the life cycle.

it should be stressed that the hox genes expressed in the apical organ in cnidarian, mollusk and annelid represent different paralogs of the hox cluster. anthox <dig>  which demarcates the apical organ in sea anemone, is a ‘posterior’ hox gene  <cit> ; lox <dig>  lox <dig> and lox <dig>  which are expressed in different cells of the apical organ of the snail trochophore  <cit> , belong to the middle part of the cluster; and hox <dig>  that we find expressed in the platynereis apical organ, is an ‘anterior’ hox gene. the utilization of different hox paralogs in the apical organ can be explained if one assumes that hox expression in apical organ cells is older than the hox cluster itself and already occurred at the times when a single ur-hox/parahox gene existed  <cit> . then, concomitant with subsequent duplication events, the expression of different hox paralogs would have been lost in divergent evolutionary lines. alternately, the hox paralogs utilized in the apical organ may have been exchanged over time. additional studies examining the downstream targets of hox expression will be useful in distinguishing between these scenarios.

the apical tuft - ancient nucleation center of apical organs
if the neuralian ancestors specifically expressed the molecular signature defined above in selected cells of the apical organ region, what cell types did the partaking genes specify and what can we learn about the ancestral composition and function of the neuralian apical organ? except for platynereis, cellular resolution molecular fingerprints are not yet available in marine primary larvae, limiting the extent of interphyletic comparison of specific cell types. however, limited molecular evidence is available and adds to a rich body of morphological evidence. the first and most obvious candidates for conserved apical organ cell types are the apical tuft cells that are widespread in neuralia  <cit> . in platynereis, the apical tuft cell exhibits a basket-shaped morphology with characteristic intracellular support structures resembling those of ampullary tuft cells in mollusks  <cit>  and stands out with the specific expression of hox <dig>  in the snail gibbula, expression of lox <dig> is confined to ‘two cilia-bearing cells of the apical organ’  <cit> ; it is as yet unclear how these relate to the ampullary tuft cells. in sea anemone, injection of anthox <dig> morpholino results in planulae lacking the apical tuft  <cit> , corroborating a link between hox expression and tuft formation. given that anthox <dig> knockdown also abolishes the ‘hole’ in six <dig> expression, one might speculate that the formation of an apical tuft involving restricted hox expression, fgf signaling and apical down-regulation of six <dig> represents the conserved core of apical organs in neuralia . this notion would imply, however, a transition from monociliated to multiciliated tuft cells: while the platynereis apical tuft cell bears multiple long motile cilia, those of some other spiralian and of deuterostome larvae are monociliated  <cit> ; likewise, the cnidarian apical tuft is composed of many cilia that each emerge from single monociliated cells  <cit> . these long cilia perform a mechanosensory function during sweeping behavior of the benthos  <cit> . in the absence of cell type-specific expression data from other neruralian larvae, the evolutionary relationship of the various tuft cells remains speculative; future studies will further clarify their evolutionary relationships within neuralians.

the apical plexus - a conserved sensory-neurosecretory release site for the control of body physiology and metamorphosis
besides the apical tuft, the apical plexus directly underneath the apical tuft may belong to the ground pattern of apical organ structures in neuralia, as it is commonly innervated by flask-shaped, neuropeptidergic sensory-neurosecretory cells from the apical plate or apical organ proper - in mollusks  <cit> , sea urchins  <cit> , hemichordates  <cit>  and, likewise, cnidarians  <cit> . among the neuropeptides secreted by these cells into the apical plexus may be two ancient types of short amidated peptides, wamides and ramides, recently proposed to predate neuralians  <cit> . in cnidarians, rfamidergic sensory neurons from ‘anterior’ larval regions project into the apical plexus  <cit> . likewise, rfamidergic cells populate the apical plate and organ in annelids , mollusks  <cit> , polyclad flatworms  <cit>  and phoronids  <cit> . wamides have been implicated in the control of larval settlement in cnidarians  <cit>  and, recently, in annelids  <cit>  and are likewise released from the apical plexus. in the late planula larva of the hydrozoan hydractinia, glwamide-positive sensory cells that innervate the apical plexus populate a belt around the apical pole  <cit> , which, by position, forms part of the apical plate; mip, a related wamide neuropeptide that induces larval settlement in annelids, is secreted into the apical plexus by apical organ cells  <cit> .

in platynereis, the transcription factor otp demarcates the neuropeptidergic sensory-neurosecretory cells in apical organ . since otp + cells also exist in the apical organ of the snail patella <cit>  and are overlapping with six <dig> expression in the apical plate of the late nematostella planula  <cit> , we hypothesize that otp + sensory-neurosecretory cells projecting to the apical plexus formed part of the apical plate in neuralian ancestors and that subsets of these cells became part of the apical organ in the bilaterian lineage. another gene demarcating the neuropeptidergic sensory-neurosecretory cells, among other cells, is nkx <dig>  the apparent deep conservation of nkx <dig> expression in apical organs  suggests an ancient role of nkx <dig> in the specification of these apical neurons; to find out, a thorough investigation of nkx3+ cells in other apical organs, for example in the cnidarian planula, will be rewarding.

besides the neuropeptidergic cells, apical serotoninergic cells represent a third type of neurosecretory cell projecting into the apical plexus. they exist in mollusks  <cit> , echinoderms  <cit> , enteropneusts  <cit>  and other bilaterian phyla  <cit> . serotonergic cells are also enriched in apical body regions of the hydrozoan cnidarian phialidium gregarium, where the release of serotonin has been reported to trigger larval settlement  <cit> . the molecular identity of serotoninergic apical cells is beginning to be elucidated: the 5ht cell included in our primr analysis appears to specifically express lmx1ab, a lim homeodomain factor implicated in serotoninergic specification in nematodes  <cit> , and nk <dig> , demarcating serotoninergic cells in sea urchin  <cit>  and, possibly, in the ptychodera tornaria  <cit> . likewise, fezf has been proposed to correlate with serotoninergic fate in the sea urchin  <cit> . further genetic studies on the serotonergic system in various marine larvae will be needed to resolve this issue.

ambient light detection
finally, our study provides strong evidence for photosensitivity being an ancient feature of apical organs. remarkably, the opsins identified in cells in and around the apical organ in platynereis , and also in terebratalia transversa <cit>  and nematostella vectensis <cit> , all fall within the peropsin/ciliary opsin families. these observations indicate that apical organs evolved as multimodal sensory structures, of which photosensitivity formed a key component.

‘minimally indirect development’ links apical patterning of larval and adult stages
the continuous deployment of the apical patterning system at larval and adult stages and the persistence of some apical plate and organ cell types into post-metamorphic stages would suggest that a gradual type of metamorphosis  is more ancient than the ‘catastrophic’ mode of metamorphosis dubbed maximal indirect development  <cit> . we refer to such a biphasic life cycle, with gradual and limited metamorphosis in which larval neural structures are incorporated into the adult nervous system, as ‘minimally indirect development.’ illustrating this, the platynereis apical organ tuft cell appears to form a ‘nucleation center’ around which the brain is organized , and the larval axons pioneer the tracts and nerves of the later nervous system  <cit> . it is possible that the eumetazoan common ancestor showed minimally indirect development with a larval stage resembling the primary ciliary larvae of modern marine bilaterians and cnidarians.

CONCLUSIONS
we have investigated regionalization of the larval episphere, the effects of ectopic activation of wnt signaling on apical patterning, and the molecular fingerprint of apical cell types in the marine annelid platynereis dumerilii. comparing our findings to those in other marine larvae, we present a core set of characteristics common to primary ciliated larvae in bilaterians and cnidarians. all larvae develop an apical plate that we define by a combination of transcription factors most prominently involving six <dig> and foxq <dig>  expression of these factors and formation of the apical plate is sensitive to wnt signaling activity. finally, a conspicuous apical tuft forms within a central six3-free territory within the apical plate. these similarities are most parsimoniously explained by common origin. we accordingly propose that the last common ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians developed via primary larvae that possessed an apical tuft as part of a simple apical organ. a basal plexus may have formed directly underneath the apical organ, which was innervated by sensory-neurosecretory apical plate cells. we hypothesize that an ancient function of the apical organ was the control of metamorphosis and opsin-based ambient light perception. various types of additional apical plate cells would then have subsequently been recruited to form part of the apical organ in the divergent bilaterian lineages. our findings support an ancient and common origin of primary ciliated larvae.
