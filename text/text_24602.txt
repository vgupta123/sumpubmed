BACKGROUND
in cell wall-encased, immobile plant cells, tight regulation of the cell division plane plays a crucial role in tissue and organ morphogenesis  <cit> . at the onset of mitosis a plant-specific cortical microtubule array, the ppb  <cit> , emerges. although the ppb disassembles as the cell enters mitosis, it precisely predicts where the new cell plate attaches to the parental cell walls at the end of cytokinesis  <cit> . cell division planes are drastically affected by the absence of ppb  <cit> , which may be achieved through experimental obliteration  <cit>  or through genetic defects  <cit> . since the discovery of the ppb four decades ago, the mechanism governing its creation and effect on delineating the future cell division plane has remained a mystery.

though initially considered to be a cortical process, ppb formation involves two coincident cytoplasmic events too, namely the migration of the nucleus towards the cell center  <cit> , and recruitment of numerous emts within motile cytoplasmic strands  <cit> . in centrifuged protonemata , nuclear displacement prior to pre-prophase induces the formation of a ppb around the new nuclear position, suggesting a role for the nucleus in ppb placement  <cit> . however, in plant cells under normal gravity conditions, the nucleus is positioned by microtubules, since its random migration is prevented by microtubular depolymerization  <cit> . these observations point towards a functional connection between the nucleus, microtubules and cell cortex for marking the ppb. in budding yeast, emts play a role in bringing the nucleus to the division plane by a cortical 'search and capture' mechanism  <cit> ; and in fission yeast, emts position the nucleus by pushing against the cortex  <cit> . under in vitro, simulated conditions, the microtubule seeds also probe the metallic boundaries of artificial chambers with cellular dimensions to bring nuclei to the center  <cit> . together, these studies on diverse systems corroborate the role of microtubules in probing the cellular geometry to settle the nucleus at the center of the cell. in the absence of information on the polarity and dynamics of plant emts, their precise role in association with the nucleus and the ppb is unclear.

in plants, in addition to the ppb, the other two mitotic microtubular arrays, the spindle and the phragmoplast microtubules, are also of endoplasmic nature. during the spindle stage, the perpendicularity of the spindle to the cell division plane is often lost because of its rotation. in mammalian and yeast cells the spindle is kept at the center of the cell or at the bud site by the centrosome-originating astral microtubules  <cit> . in addition, any error in spindle orientation in these cell types is corrected by the outgoing astral microtubules, which probe the cortex to ensure that the segregated chromosomes are sufficiently distant and are not cleaved by the constricting actomyosin ring  <cit> . in acentrosomal plant cells, after ppb breakdown and disappearance of the nuclear surface-bound emt, the factors maintaining the spindle at the cell centre still remain unresolved. paradoxically, in plant cells possessing disoriented spindles, the cell plates are still able to anchor properly to the division sites marked perpendicularly to the cell axis. a mechanism obviously exists in plant cells to correct spindle disorientation and reinforce the line of cell division, but it remains obscure.

here, we investigated the role of emts during ppb formation and their subsequent behavior following karyokinesis. because of their uniform cell size, continuous cell division activity and absence of background fluorescence, tobacco by- <dig> cell suspensions remain a system of choice for plant cell cycle studies  <cit> . therefore, we used tobacco by- <dig> cells stably transformed with different microtubular markers, and performed a live cell time-lapse analysis to elucidate the role of emts in reinforcing the lines of the cell division planes in plants.

RESULTS
gfp-ateb <dig> labeled plant microtubule plus ends exhibit guided growth to create bundles
microtubule plus-end labeling has been achieved using a gfp-ateb <dig> fusion protein and permits observations on microtubule growth directionality and dynamics  <cit> . in interphase cells, gfp-ateb <dig> highlighted the bidirectional movement of comet-like structures, suggesting plus end growth of cortical microtubules of opposite growth polarities . in co-transformed cells, gfp-ateb <dig> labeled the growing ends of yfp-map <dig> labeled microtubules  and co-localized with yfp-clip <dig>  on the growing microtubular plus ends, reconfirming the plus end-specific localization of gfp-ateb <dig> in by- <dig> cells.

general observations on microtubule guidance and bundling formed the basis of our subsequent experiments. tracking the gfp-ateb <dig> comets, it was found that > <dig> % of freshly polymerizing microtubules exhibited guided growth on tracks established by existing microtubules, thereby creating bundles of microtubules . preexisting microtubule-guided oriented bundling often involved i) two or more microtubules with apparently similar polarity moving one after the other, ii) microtubules with presumably opposite polarities moving in opposite directions to each other or iii) independent microtubules moving together as a pair with similar velocities  . although mammalian eb <dig> often induces microtubule bundling upon overexpression, ateb <dig> did not cause the observed bundling in the plant cells since it lacks the microtubule bundling domain present in the mammalian ortholog  <cit> . instead, intermicrotubular bridges  <cit>  might be responsible for the observed bundle formation. in addition, when two microtubules grew together side-by-side on the same track, it was frequently observed that one of them shrank while the other continued growing . further information on microtubular guidance and bundling mechanisms came from analysis of cells coexpressing gfp-ateb <dig> and yfp-map <dig>  a growing microtubule  could detach from an existing track and move on to another track where its growth became guided in another direction . interphase microtubules in mammalian cells show a similar guidance mechanism  <cit> . we also observed individual microtubule plus ends approaching each other from a similar  or opposite  direction and meeting without inducing catastrophe. strikingly, microtubular nucleation was sometimes initiated on an existing microtubule , an observation consistent with the plant-specific localization of gamma tubulin along the microtubule length  <cit>  and with a study reporting microtubule nucleation from stable tubulin oligomers  <cit> . microtubules also changed trajectories by reorienting their minus or plus ends when one of the ends was supported on the other polymer . it was also observed that motile polymers exhibiting specialized treadmilling  <cit>  initiated bundling by bridging the two preexisting and separate polymers . in cases of guided growth-induced bundling, a shorter microtubule could adopt the growth direction of a preexisting longer microtubule and vice versa . when one of the microtubules in a bundle retracted, it frequently caused the other to bend, implying the exertion of a pulling force . we also observed that upon release of a minus end from a nucleation site, the opposite plus end depolymerized , whereas upon acquisition of a new support by its minus end the microtubule retained growth  . these observations indicate a provision for new nucleation on existing polymers, while suggesting that in certain cases the plus end somehow 'senses' the physical state of the opposite minus end. together, these findings implicate intermicrotubular affinities and the capacity of the polymers to nucleate new or detached microtubules as a general mode of microtubule survival, reorientation and bundle creation.

emergence, polarity and dynamics of emts at the onset of cell division
equipped with information on the general polar behavior of microtubules in interphase cells we approached the questions of appearance, polarity and dynamics of the emts, specifically at the onset of cell division. during preprophase, more dynamic emts emerged, bridging the nucleus to the cortex and exhibiting considerable bidirectionality  with outgoing  and incoming  emts. more outgoing  than incoming microtubules were observed though their growth rates were similar . like cortical microtubules, emts also exhibited bundling and guidance characteristics indicating the existence of intermicrotubular affinities in the cytosol even in the absence of a cortical support. in contrast to yeast preprophase cells, where unidirectional microtubules  position the nucleus by pushing or pulling forces  <cit> , our observations together with others  <cit>  on the requirement of emts for nuclear displacement and their bidirectionality suggest that plant cells can utilize both outgoing and incoming emts for positioning the premitotic nucleus. conversely, with bundling and track follow-up, the incoming microtubules might guide the outgoing ones to achieve selective cortical targeting. this may be an efficient mechanism for their navigation of intracellular space, since when many microtubules grow simultaneously in a bundle, the chance that microtubules will reach the cortical target without becoming depolymerized in the process is expected to be substantially higher. interestingly, emts maintained continuous contact with the cortical areas occupied by the developing ppb. at ppb maturation, the emts between the ppb and nuclear envelope  remained bidirectional while those connecting to more distal cortical areas became unidirectional, displaying a radiating comet-like spectacular firework . at this stage, kymographs generated by tracking the gfp-ateb <dig> comets clearly illustrate accelerated growth for both outgoing  and incoming  emts. microtubule growth was maintained at ca.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min  at the ppb  <cit>  . consequently, the microtubule density on the ne gradually increased , confirming earlier observations on microtubular growth and stabilization on the ne in plant  <cit>  and mammalian  <cit>  cells. our observations suggest that at the onset of mitosis, the outwardly-radiating emts position the nucleus in the center of the cell by pushing/pulling forces, while the bidirectional emts connecting the ne to the ppb position the nucleus at the centre of the ppb. moreover, during ppb maturation, the change from bidirectional growth  to unidirectional growth  of emts severely reduces their chance of survival and thereby causes their detachment and collapse.

role of emts in premitotic cytoplasmic organization
the implications of the emt configuration for the organization of the premitotic cytoplasm were now investigated using gfp-map <dig> transformed by- <dig> cells  <cit>  together with various organelle markers. during g2-m transition, fm4-64-labeled endosomes , alexa 633-labeled pinocytic vesicles , st-yfp-labeled golgi bodies   and mitotracker-labeled mitochondria  all localized along the emts. in contrast to interphase, when the microtubules remain at the cortex and large vacuoles occupy the cell space , the vacuoles appeared fragmented by intersecting emts during preprophase . previous studies have shown that the motility of cytoplasmic organelles in plants is mainly actin-based  <cit>  and that the actin cytoskeleton co-exists with the mitotic microtubular arrays  <cit> . to further investigate the respective roles of microtubules and actin filaments in premitotic cytoplasmic organization, we treated the cells with latrunculin b  and oryzalin . in latrunculin b-treated cells, the emts appeared stabilized and more intense with a normal cytoplasmic configuration , whereas oryzalin destroyed the emts and caused cytoplasmic disorganization and nuclear displacement . after combined oryzalin and latrunculin b treatment the nucleus completely lost its central position and the cytoplasm  became completely disorganized . after the oryzalin was washed out, the emts gradually reappeared and the cytoplasm regained its normal configuration with the nucleus replaced at the cell centre . together, these results suggest that emts have a major role in organizing the premitotic cytoplasm, but they do not discount the role of actin in mediating organelle motility.

guided growth of emts towards the ppb site and their coincident localization with endocytic vesicles
the implications of the observation, which differentiated between intracellular motility and intracellular compartmentalization, became apparent when we investigated the localization pattern for fm4- <dig> labeled endocytic vesicles in relation to the microtubules. during interphase, fm4- <dig> labeled endocytic vesicles were randomly localized in the cell , but early in the g2-m transition they started coaligning with emerging emts . in gfp-ateb <dig> transformed cells, these endocytic vesicles displayed internalization paths along the emt trajectories and their appearance coincided with the cortical sites approached by the emt plus ends . oryzalin-induced microtubule depolymerization immediately affected endocytic vesicular internalization, with complete disruption of their internalization routes . when the oryzalin was washed out, the reformed emts again approached the cortex and the internalization of the endocytic vesicle traffic resumed . most importantly, during ppb maturation the endocytic material aggregated at the cortical areas occupied by the ppb and approached by the radiating emt plus ends . consequently, the endocytic vesicles formed a cortical belt loosely co-localizing with the microtubular ppb . support for this observation comes from a recent electron microscope study analyzing the membrane architecture of the ppb, which revealed an accumulation of clathrin-coated and non-coated pits specifically in the ppb regions  <cit> . moreover, the activity of an endosomal marker protein ara <dig> , is known to be up-regulated during mitosis  <cit> , and a similar ppb belt was observed using gfp-ara <dig> labeled endosomes . furthermore, the endosomal band we observed co-localized with a band comprising golgi bodies   <cit> . it is noteworthy that during ppb maturation, the emts, which connect the nucleus to the cortical ppb, prohibit a continuous vacuolar structure and thereby create a cytoplasmic area proximal to the ppb . this cytoplasmic area occupied by the emts at ppb maturation is still maintained at the spindle stage . it has been proposed that the actin-depleted zone , which appears during ppb breakdown and is also maintained throughout cytokinesis, participates in regulating the division plane, since actin disruption before adz formation affects the cell division planes  <cit> . we speculate that the lack of actin prohibits further transport of continuously endocytosed material, contributing to the formation of a coherent endosomal belt, for it has been shown that plant endosomal trafficking is mostly actin-based  <cit> .

emts radiating from the former spindle poles attain a geometrical conformation correlating with cell-plate navigation and tilt-correction
following observations on microtubule and organelle behavior during the early stages of mitosis, we analyzed events at later stages. immediately after chromosomal separation at anaphase, the emts emanating from the region occupied by spindle poles 'probed' the cell cortex  while exhibiting unidirectional growth at speeds of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min . during late telophase, these emts mainly probed the cortical areas previously occupied by the ppb . in addition, the emts originating from the non-facing surfaces of the daughter nuclei appeared fewer than the phragmoplast microtubules and occasionally exhibited growth trajectories towards the cell poles . because of the remarkable co-incidence between the emts and endocytosed material during preprophase, we investigated whether these emts approaching the cortex co-localized with fm4-64-labeled endocytic material during telophase. such co-localization was observed both for gfp-map <dig>  and gfp-ateb <dig>  labeled emts which were approaching the former ppb sites. during cell plate expansion, the emts appeared to navigate the cell plate and to align it to establish a clear line of division . emt plus ends within the phragmoplast midline  were labeled strongly with gfp-ateb <dig> but less strongly with yfp-map <dig>  indicating the polarity of the phragmoplast microtubules, oriented with their plus ends towards the developing cell plate .

in budding yeast, cytokinesis is delayed until the spindle is properly positioned, but in a mutant for bim <dig>  this delay is abolished, resulting in abnormal cell division  <cit> . this suggests that bim <dig> has an important role in sensing and positioning the spindle. cytokinesis in plants often begins with tilted spindles, indicating the absence of a spindle alignment checkpoint in plant cells. however, this spindle tilting is corrected later during the progression of cytokinesis, which may indicate the involvement of a positioning sensor and correction mechanism in plant cells. we propose that the emts initiating from the spindle poles and approaching the cortex  are involved in this sensor and tilting mechanism. though different scenarios can be evoked for the correction mechanism, in each case a specialized cortical reference site would be required. we therefore investigated the effect of an auxin efflux inhibitor, npa, which has been shown to block both vesicular trafficking and internalization of plasma membrane-localized proteins  <cit>  without directly affecting microtubules or actin filaments  <cit> .

polarity inhibitor induces abnormal ppbs and shifts cell division planes
prolonged npa treatment in by- <dig> cells caused inclined and periclinal cell divisions  instead of normal anticlinal cell divisions , as in tobacco vbi- <dig> cells  <cit> . cells with aberrant division planes also exhibited major alterations in interphase cortical microtubule alignments in the daughter cells . npa treatment caused formation of abnormal ppbs  that resulted in inclined spindles  and phragmoplasts , resulting in shifted division planes. in some npa-treated cells, two separate ppbs were observed and the inclined cell plate was attached to the parental cell walls, with either end docking at one of the places marked by these two ppbs . closer observation of this two-ppb situation revealed a preferential attachment of the cell plate at the ppb sites connecting with the largest number of emts . these results, together with observations from other laboratories, implicate a link between the intracellular establishment of polarity, endocytosis, the placement of initial ppbs and the final cell division planes.

discussion
in mammalian and yeast cells, a microtubule plus end-mediated 'search and capture' mechanism has been credited with positioning and aligning the spindles  <cit>  and determining the plane of cell division  <cit> . our observations suggest that emts in plant cells may behave similarly to establish and regulate the cell division plane. interestingly, it has been shown previously that injuries caused by inserting microneedles at these specific cortical sites, probed by emts during cytokinesis, affect cell plate alignment  <cit> .

in mammalian and yeast cells, eb <dig> binds to adenomatous polyposis coli . in epithelial cells, apc is mainly found at specialized cortical sites  <cit> , providing a planar cue  <cit> . in mammalian cells, microtubule-mediated apc delivery to specialized cortical sites has been demonstrated  <cit> . a mechanism for attaining polarity cues is proposed for mammalian cells, according to which the eb1-labeled microtubule plus ends target to the specialized apc-marked cortical sites  <cit> . a similar role in attracting eb1-labeled microtubular plus ends towards the cortex has been attributed to kar9p in budding yeast  <cit>  and to moe <dig> in fission yeast  <cit> . moreover, it has been suggested that lis <dig> is a regulated adapter between clip <dig> and cytoplasmic dynein at sites involved in cargo-microtubule loading and/or the control of microtubule dynamics  <cit> .

interestingly, plants seem to possess homologues for apc, kar9p and moe <dig>  and the plant cytoskeletal-related tonneau <dig>  <cit>  protein contains a lish domain present in lis <dig> . in maize, the tangled <dig>  mutant displays altered ppbs, spindles and phragmoplasts and shifted cell division planes. furthermore, tangled <dig> expression and its microtubule localization correlate with the cell division stage  <cit> . in mammalian cells, eb <dig> is required for microtubule tip-specific localization of apc but not vice versa. in the absence of eb <dig>  apc localizes all along the microtubule lengths  <cit> . in addition, apc assembly in the cortical clusters is eb1-independent but depends on the existence of the armadillo domain  <cit> . in plants, it remains to be determined how eb <dig> localizes in the tangled <dig> mutant and vice versa. from parallels in the mammalian cell literature one might hypothesize that tangled1-mediated eb <dig> targeting to specialized cortical sites regulates the cell division planes in plants. however, there are several problems with this hypothesis. for instance, tangled <dig> contains only the microtubule binding domain and lacks both the eb <dig> binding and the armadillo domains of apc  <cit> . inversely, ateb <dig> possesses an apc interaction domain  <cit>  and a unique c-terminal acidic tail  <cit> , and armadillo domain-containing proteins exist in arabidopsis  <cit> . this leaves open the possibility that eb <dig> interacts with other pm-localized basic protein. in addition, plants lacking tonneau <dig> fail to assemble ppb  <cit>  and tonneau <dig> possesses a lish domain. from the parallel mammalian cell literature one might hypothesize that the lish domain in tonneau <dig> may mediate emt plus end cortical interactions. hence it will be interesting to determine how eb <dig> localizes in tangled <dig> and tonneau <dig> mutants and vice versa.

in mammalian cells, many proteins have been shown to associate in a microtubule plus end complex, which has been described as a plus end raft  <cit> . as with lipid rafts, protein concentration at the distal ends may allow a cascade of interactions in the restricted area of a microtubule plus end. this may, in turn, control the dynamic behavior of this cytoskeletal network and its anchoring to other structures  <cit> . an alternative to this would be that emts, by interpreting cell geometry and polarity cues, deposit protein at the ppb, which subsequently attracts the phragmoplast microtubules. conversely, the connection between emt plus ends and endocytosis may indicate a role for localized endocytosis in modifying the pm architecture, which may transmit the memory for re-attracting emt plus ends during cytokinesis. we consider that the polarity inhibitor npa affects ppb formation by modulating endocytosis, as it does not affect microtubules but interferes with endocytosis and with polarity-based emt plus end targeting to specialized areas of the pm. thus, feedback loops, comprising polarity establishment-endocytosis-microtubule plus end guidance-further endocytosis, appear to be essential for defining and creating planes of cell division in plant cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results suggest that in mitotic plant cells, emt plus ends may act as cell shape/polarity sensing and orienting machines by their sustained cortical targeting, as shown for yeast  <cit> . emts in premitotic plant cells are bundled and bidirectional, as reported very recently in fission yeast by analysis of the eb <dig> homologue mal3p  <cit> , indicating evolutionary conservation of the processes involved in defining cell division planes. importantly, we show that at preprophase the targeting of emt plus ends coincides with endocytosis events to establish a plant-specific cortical endocytic belt. during cytokinesis, this same belt again interacts with the emt plus ends of the expanding phragmoplast to ensure proper cell plate navigation and docking. our results reveal a link between the position of emt plus ends, the establishment of intracellular polarity and the localization of endocytosis that is essential for the regulation of cell division planes in plants.
