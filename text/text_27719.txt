BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short 21- <dig> nt non-coding rnas that are processed from one of the arms of hairpin-like 60- <dig> nt precursor mirnas . pre-mirnas are produced from primary pri-mirnas transcribed from mirna genes by rna polymerase ii. mature mirnas  trigger posttranscriptional regulation of the target mrnas mediated by a specific set of effector proteins  <cit> . the perfectly complementary mirs induce mrna degradation in plants, while in animals the partially complementary mirs cause mainly mrna degradation but also the blocking of translation  <cit> . mirna-mediated inhibition of target mrna translation is considered to be a powerful mechanism of gene expression regulation. besides the prevalent mature mirs, the minor star molecules  are generated from the opposite arm of the pre-mirnas and sometimes also capable to inhibit expression of target mrnas  <cit> . the choice of pre-mirna strand producing the mature mir is determined by the strands' sequences.

up to several hundred of mirna genes are present in eukaryotic genomes, and often mirnas are located close to each other in a genome, forming genomic clusters  <cit> ; for instance, drosophila melanogaster has at least  <dig> mirna genes  and almost half of them are clustered. clustered mirnas are often co-expressed  <cit>  and can jointly regulate functionally related genes, e.g. included in the same signaling pathway  <cit> . obviously, the regulation of the expression of individual clustered mirnas can fine-tune the pathway modulation. since clusters are considered to be transcribed as single primary pri-mirna transcripts  <cit> , such regulation can be achieved by post-transcriptional regulation of mirna maturation  <cit> . in this report we found that several drosophila mirna clusters contain mirnas with the expression profiles different from the profiles of the other mirnas in the same cluster. our data argue in favor of a contribution of post-transcriptional rather than transcriptional regulation to the tissue-specific expression of these uncoordinated mirna clusters.

RESULTS
overview of mir clusters
here we refer to the grouped mirna genes as mirna cluster if they are located not more than  <dig> kb apart. a summary of  <dig> drosophila mirna clusters is presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  using the above criterion, dme-mir- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> should be related to a single cluster, but the analysis of pair correlation coefficients of their tissue expression profiles  shows that dme-mir- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> and dme-mir- <dig>  - <dig> are clearly separated into two clusters, as has been noted before  <cit> . the  <dig> cluster, containing a tandem of identical and indistinguishable dme-mir-281- <dig> and dme-mir-281- <dig> was excluded from the further expression analyzes. similarly, identical dme-mir-6- <dig>  -6- <dig>  -6- <dig> from the 6~ <dig> cluster, dme-mir-2a- <dig>  -2a- <dig> from the 2a~2b cluster, and dme-mir-983- <dig>  -983- <dig> from the 983~ <dig> cluster were considered as a single mirna within each cluster. the subsequent expression analysis showed an adequacy of this simplification. in total, we have examined  <dig> mirna clusters.

some clustered mirnas have uncoordinated expression profiles
to determine the mirna expression profiles, we analyzed  <dig> million reads of sequenced small rnas from  <dig> publicly available libraries prepared from heads, bodies, testes, ovaries, embryos and s <dig> cells . the coordinated expression of clustered mirnas has been described earlier in human, mouse and fruit fly  <cit> . consistent with these data, we showed that in contrast to mirnas from different clusters or non-clustered mirnas, mirnas from the same cluster tend to be co-expressed in the similar set of tissues  . the evaluation of the frequency distributions of the mirna correlation coefficients of expression profiles also demonstrates that highly correlated mirnas are mainly related to mirnas from the same cluster , but not to mirnas from different clusters. therefore, expression of mirna clusters is regulated independently to each another.

while the expression profiles of mirnas in  <dig> clusters have a high coefficient of correlation  , a small fraction of clustered mirnas have a low correlation coefficient of the expression profiles . indeed, inspecting the pair correlation coefficient values and heatmaps revealed that  <dig> clusters  contain mirnas, the profiles of which differ from the rest of the mirnas in the same cluster  . the expression levels of uncorrelated mirnas are sufficiently high and similar to the correlated ones , thus the low correlation values of expression profiles are not due to random noise in mirna detection. in the 13b~2c cluster a wrong conclusion of a lack of correlation of dme-mir-13b- <dig> to dme-mir-13a and dme-mir-2c can be formally deduced due to the superposition of the expression of the non-clustered paralog dme-mir-13b- <dig> with identical sequence. the other  <dig> clusters are likely to have genuinely uncoordinated mirnas. for instance, the expression profiles of dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> in cluster 283~ <dig> correlate to one another , but at the same time the profile of dme-mir- <dig> does not correlate to both dme-mir- <dig>  and dme-mir- <dig> .

1uncorrelated mirnas are characterized by low correlation coefficient with the corresponding mir*; although the 100~ <dig> cluster possibly has two uncorrelated mirnas, dme-let- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig>  only dme-mir- <dig> does not correlate to dme-mir-100* .

promoters of mir clusters
coordinated expression of clustered mirnas can be explained by the transcription of a whole cluster as a single polycistronic precursor rna driven by an upstream promoter, as has been reported earlier  <cit> . using rna-seq and tilling microarrays of rna samples from  <dig> fly developmental stages, single pri-mirnas for  <dig> non-clustered mirnas as well as  <dig> mirna clusters have been identified  <cit> . by contrast, uncoordination of the expression profiles of some clustered mirnas may result from independent transcription of these mirnas from their own promoters. moreover, although polycistronic transcript of the uncoordinated 100~ <dig> cluster has been detected in pupae and ecdysone-treated s <dig> cells  <cit> , it cannot rule out a possibility of the presence the tissue-specific intra-cluster promoters.

to test a possibility of independent transcription of clustered mirs, we have evaluated the positions of their putative promoters in silico. we focused on the search of rna polymerase ii promoters because only a few mirna genes have rna polymerase iii promoters  <cit> . it has been shown that transcription start sites  of drosophila pol ii promoters associate with the specific pair combinations of sequence motifs  <cit> . in our analysis of cluster promoters we have used a set of tsss predicted to be located near the detected combinations of such motifs . similar approaches of promoter finding by localization of putative tsss for human mirnas have been performed earlier  <cit> . two examples of putative tsss for coordinated and uncoordinated clusters are shown in figure  <dig>  the full list of cluster tsss is presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

the starts of 5'-ends of pri-mirnas of coordinated 1002~ <dig> and 277~ <dig> clusters  <cit>  are coincided with location of the predicted tsss within  <dig> nt range. the 277~ <dig> cluster also has intra-cluster tsss upstream of dme-mir- <dig>  the next  <dig> clusters containing mirnas with coordinated expressions  have one or several tsss upstream of the first mirna  but not within the clusters. another  <dig> clusters  are neighbors and have  <dig> putative tsss - the first tss is located upstream of the 972~ <dig> and the second one is located inside the 972~ <dig> and upstream of the 975~ <dig> and 978- <dig> clusters. this suggests that the 972~ <dig> cluster may be transcribed from the first tss and both tsss may be used to ensure transcription of the other two clusters. the next two coordinated clusters, 998~ <dig> and 2a~2b, are encoded in introns of protein-coding genes and have no predicted tsss, and coordination of their expression can be explained by the transcription from the host genes promoters. we failed to detect any tss for the 309~ <dig> cluster, but its single promoter as well as precursor have been identified and experimentally verified earlier  <cit> . no nearest tsss were found for the last 991~ <dig> cluster. overall, almost all correlated mirna clusters  contain only upstream putative pol ii promoters ensuring transcription of the whole cluster and coordination of clustered mir expressions .

surprisingly, similarly to the coordinated clusters, the 100~ <dig>  275~ <dig>  9c~9b, 283~ <dig> and 13b~2c clusters containing mirnas with uncoordinated expression patterns, also have one or several tsss only upstream of the first mirna in a cluster . none of these  <dig> clusters have any tss near the internal mirnas .

the distances between mirnas within clusters usually small , and a lack of putative tsss can be explained by a low probability of finding them there. to estimate this probability, we calculated an empirical cumulative distribution function  of lengths from the starts of fly mirnas to the nearest upstream putative tss. then, the probability p to observe a tss in a region of the given length x can be determined as p = ecdf. indeed, the short inter-mirna spaces seem to explain the absence of tsss within mirna clusters since their mean p =  <dig>  and median p =  <dig> . there are also five 500- <dig> nt regions with probability  <dig> ≤p ≤  <dig>  from coordinated and uncoordinated clusters, one and only one of which  contains two tsss, and this is fully consistent with statistical prediction.

moreover, to estimate the accuracy of mcpromoter in the prediction of mirna tsss we checked an enrichment of the tsss by pol ii using the modencode chip-seq data. we have found that all putative tsss of  <dig> mirna clusters are located in pol ii enrichment regions, demonstrating that mcpromoter have a very high specificity in tsss prediction . the location tsss of the other clusters near the pol ii enriched exons of genes prevents their precise attribution to tsss. except for a 277~ <dig>  none of the large cluster intra-mirna regions are enriched by pol ii. in addition, there are no significantly conservative regions upstream of uncorrelated mirnas that could have hinted at the presence of cryptic promoters. . therefore, the lack of correlations of the mirna expression for at least  <dig> clusters  is unlikely to be explained by independent transcription of the contained mirna genes.

comparison of clustered mir and mir* expression profiles
the post-transcriptional regulation of mirna maturation can be considered as a possible reason of uncoordinated expression of clustered mirs. if alteration of processing or stability happens to mir or its mir*, then their expression profiles may differ, leading to the corresponding low correlation coefficient values. to test this assumption, we determined the correlation coefficients of the expression profiles of clustered mirs and mirs*. indeed, although expression levels of clustered mirs* are comparable to one another , the correlation coefficient of expression profiles of almost all mir/mir* pairs from each coordinated cluster are high and similar , while uncorrelated mirs from each uncoordinated cluster have low correlation coefficients with the corresponding antisense mirs* . for instance, the expression profile of dme-mir-306* has a low correlation coefficient with the dme-mir- <dig> profile  and correlates well to all other mirs in the 9c~9b cluster .

interestingly, the expression profiles of mirs* of uncorrelated mirs in 283~ <dig> and 277~ <dig> clusters differ not only from their mirs but also from profiles of the rest of mirs in the cluster. dme-mir-283* correlates neither to dme-mir- <dig> itself  nor to dme-mir- <dig>  or dme-mir- <dig>  . similarly, expression of dme-mir-305* from the 275~ <dig> cluster does not correlate both to dme-mir- <dig>  and dme-mir- <dig>  . this observation can suggest that hairpin processing regulation or independent regulation of stability of not only mirs but also mirs* in some tissue takes place.

analysis of the pair correlation coefficients of dme-mir- <dig>  dme-let- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> for the 100~ <dig> cluster demonstrates the complex nature of post-transcriptional regulation . it is hard to interpret unambiguously the data but it seems that independent regulation of dme-mir- <dig> and dme-let- <dig> is occurred. in human, mouse and nematode lin <dig> protein binds the conserved pre-let- <dig>  inducing hairpin 3'-end uridylation and its degradation  <cit> . consistently, we propose that in flies the precursor of dme-let- <dig> is regulated on a level of hairpin stability because expression profiles of dme-let- <dig> and dme-let-7* are highly similar  but each of them is slightly different from profiles of dme-mir- <dig>  and dme-mir-100* . a weak correlation of dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir-100*  demonstrates the possibility of dme-mir- <dig> regulation during its maturation. this is confirmed by finding of the noticeable tissue-specific a-to-i editing of dme-mir- <dig> in male heads and kc <dig> cell line  <cit> . dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir-125* correlate both to dme-mir- <dig> and dme-let- <dig>  thus complicating the further analysis.

at the same time, mirs and mirs* from almost all clusters with coordinated mir expression profiles have a high correlation coefficient with each other. the only exception is the 991~ <dig> cluster where dme-mir-992* can be considered as a target of post-transcriptional regulation . in contrast to dme-mir-991*, the expression profile of dme-mir-992* does not correlate to the profiles of dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> 

one can speculate that clustered mirnas with uncoordinated expression profiles are transcribed independently and the absence of upstream tsss is explained by modest sensitivity of the mcpromoter program. since  <dig> of  <dig> identified pri-pre-mirnas  <cit>  have one or several tsss predicted by mcpromoter within  <dig> nt range from their 5' ends , a sensitivity for prediction of mirnas promoters is equal to 60%. this is consisted with previously published data  <cit>  and indicates a possible underrepresentation of the used tss set. but the lack of correlation of mirs and mirs* strongly suggests their post-transcriptional regulation. selective post-transcriptional regulation of pre-mirnas from polycistronic primary pri-mirnas was reported earlier for the human pre-mir-18a from the mir17~ <dig> cluster  <cit>  and for pre-mir-27a from the mir23~ <dig>  <cit> . here we predict that mirs and mirs* from at least  <dig> fly mir clusters  undergo post-transcriptional regulation.

it is necessary to note that analyzed small rna libraries were prepared by three different laboratories. it was shown that sequencing efficiencies of individual mirnas may differ for libraries prepared by different ways  <cit> . thus, difference in mirna read counts between libraries may be caused by differential cloning efficiencies rather than reflecting different expression levels. all libraries used in the analysis were prepared according to the same protocol from pfeffer et al  <cit>  with some lab-specific variations. the main source of small rna bias in the read frequencies are 5' and 3' adapter ligation steps since three 3'-end nucleotides of acceptor and one 5' end nucleotide of donor can influence ligation efficiency by t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  <cit> . however, the end nucleotide bias for the 3' adapter ligation step can be alleviated by the use of truncated rna ligase  <dig>  rnl <dig>  which has nearly 100% ligation efficiency regardless of the end nucleotides  <cit> . since rnl <dig> ligase was used by all three laboratories, it is reasonable to assume that cloning biases due to 3' adapter ligation are not significant. regarding the 5' adapter ligation step performed by t <dig> rna ligase  <dig>  three 3'-end nucleotides of 5' adapters  are highly efficient and identical  for  <dig> of  <dig> libraries, thus this is unlikely to be the source of mirna cloning bias. only two libraries were prepared using 5' adapter with different 3'-end nucleotides  that does not introduce a significant impact on total tissue expression profiles. the subsequent reverse transcription and pcr steps also may have some effect on sequencing efficiencies of mirnas, but it is determined mainly by primary structure of small rnas itself but not caused by cloning protocols  <cit> . although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of cloning artifacts in some analyzed small rna libraries altering mirna expression profiles, we suggest that generally our main conclusions are correct. expanding the set of tissues by libraries from other sources can increase the number of uncorrelated mirnas and uncoordinated mirna clusters as well as change the correlation coefficients of above mentioned mirnas.

to test our conclusions on the independent data, we have conducted the correlation analysis of mirna expression profiles with the expanded dataset from the recently published libraries  <cit> . this expanded dataset contains  <dig> selected libraries with more than  <dig> million reads . in accord with our observations, the expression profiles of dme-mir- <dig>  dme-mir- <dig>  dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> have low correlation coefficients with profiles of the corresponding mirnas*. the expression profiles of dme-mir- <dig>  dme-mir- <dig>  dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> are also weakly correlated to at least one mirna from their clusters. thus, although the correlation coefficients for several clustered mirnas are different, in general the results remain the same.

several possible mechanisms of mirna expression regulation have been described, including the modulation of drosha and dicer activities, uridylation of pre-mirnas and mirs, a-to-i editing of pri- and pre-mirnas . for dme-let- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> the possible mechanisms of their post-transcriptional regulation are the tissue-specific uridylation and a-to-i editing of their precursors respectively . interestingly, dme-let- <dig> as well as clustered coordinated dme-mir- <dig> and dme-mir- <dig> were also shown to be a-to-i edited in some tissues  <cit> . however, the expression levels of these mirnas expression are very low in these tissues, thus explaining an absence of the influence of editing events on their tissue expression profiles. as the rest of uncoordinated clustered mirnas seem not to undergo editing in the analyzed tissues, the impact of other mechanisms on the regulation of their expression remains to be revealed.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report we demonstrate that although most drosophila mirna clusters are co-expressed in the similar set of tissues, the 283~ <dig>  275~ <dig>  9c~9b, 100~ <dig> and 991~ <dig> clusters contain some mirnas with different tissue expression profiles compared to other mirnas from the corresponding clusters. this is unlikely to be explained by independent mirna transcription because clusters have identifiable putative transcription start sites only upstream of their first mirna. most probably uncorrelated clustered mirnas undergo tissue specific post-transcriptional regulation, which is confirmed by a lack of correlation of mir and corresponding mir* expression profiles.
