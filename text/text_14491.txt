BACKGROUND
plant trichomes are appendages that originate from epidermal cells and are present on the surface of various plant organs such as leaves, stems, pods, seed coats, flowers, and fruits. trichome morphology, varying greatly among species, includes types that are unicellular, multicellular, glandular, non-glandular , single stalks , or branched structures   <cit> . various functions have been ascribed to trichomes, including roles as attractants of pollinators, in protection from herbivores and uv light, and in transpiration and leaf temperature regulation  <cit> .

the genetic control of non-glandular trichome initiation and development has been studied extensively in arabidopsis and cotton. in arabidopsis, several genes were identified that regulate trichome initiation and development. a knockout of glabra <dig>  results in glabrous arabidopsis plants  <cit> . the gl <dig> encodes a r2r <dig> myb transcription factor that binds either gl <dig> or enhancer of glabra <dig> , basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors, which in turn bind to transparent testa glabra  protein, a wd <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . the binding of gl1-gl3/egl3-ttg <dig> forms a ternary complex, which initiates the progression of an epidermal cell development into a trichome by binding to the glabra <dig>  gene, which encodes a homodomain/leucine zipper transcription factor  <cit> .

microarray gene expression analysis of two arabidopsis mutants lacking trichomes with wild-type arabidopsis trichomes identified several cell-wall related up-regulated genes  <cit> . transcriptome analyses of wild-type trichomes and the double mutant gl3-sst sim trichomes in arabidopsis identified four new genes: hdg <dig>  blt, pel <dig>  and svb that are potentially associated with trichome development  <cit> .

cotton fibers are single celled trichomes that develop from the surface of cotton seed  <cit> . the development of cotton fibers goes through four stages of development: differentiation/fiber initiation, expansion/elongation, secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and maturity  <cit> . unlike arabidopsis, the specific genes/proteins involved in cotton fiber initiation have not been clearly elucidated. several different approaches have been taken to study cotton fiber initiation and elongation, including studying gene expression in normal fibers  <cit> , comparing gene expression in fiber development mutants to normal cotton varieties  <cit> , and using existing est or gene sequences from cotton or arabidopsis clones  <cit> .

microarray studies comparing cotton fiber initiation mutants identified six clones falling into either burp-containing protein or rd22-like protein that were over expressed in cotton fibers in wild-type compared with the mutant lines  <cit> . these six clones are all members of the burp domain gene family as the rd <dig> protein that was identified in arabidopsis is also a member of the burp domain family of proteins  <cit> .

soybean has  <dig> possible burp domain containing genes which are classified into five subfamilies: bnm2-like, usp-like, rd22-like, pg1β-like, and burpv  depending on the translated products homology to these founding members of the burp family  <cit> . burp genes are plant-specific and with diverse functions in plants  <cit> .

unlike arabidopsis and cotton, the developmental genetics of soybean trichomes has not been studied extensively. however, there are several soybean trichome developmental mutants available, including p <dig> , pc , pd , ps , and p <dig>  that are each controlled by a different single mendelian locus  <cit> . these mutants have been used to relate the importance of trichome to insect resistance  <cit> , evapotranspiration  <cit>  and other yield related characteristics. however, until now, none of these glabrous classical mutations has been studied at the molecular level. we studied the dominant p <dig> glabrous soybean mutant using two high throughput transcript sequencing technologies to reveal major expression differences between the two genotypes. rna and dna blots further characterized a highly differentially expressed burp family member glyma04g <dig> that varied between the two genotypes and may be associated with trichome development in soybean although it is not a candidate for the p <dig> locus.

RESULTS
dge library construction and identification of authentic tags
we first used illumina dge tag profiling to determine the differential gene expression between wild-type clark standard  and glabrous-mutant clark glabrous  in shoot tip tissue. the cg isoline was developed by backcrossing the p <dig> glabrous mutant into clark for six generations  <cit> . total rna isolated from shoot tips of both cs and cg plants was analyzed by illumina dge tag profiling to create transcriptome profiles of the two isolines. dge tags are 16-nucleotide long and are designed to be derived from the 3'utr of the transcript. dge data provide a quantitative measure of transcript abundance in the rna population and can also identify previously unannotated genes. the majority of dge tags are expected to match only one location in the genome, with the remaining tags matching duplicated genes, alternate transcripts, antisense strands, or repeated sequences  <cit> .

we obtained a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  million tags from the cs and cg lines respectively, that resulted in approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique tags from the cs and cg lines, which had counts of  <dig> tags or more in at least one library. dge tags were aligned to the  <dig>  cdna gene models  predicted from the soybean reference genome of cv. williams  <dig>  <cit>  and available from phytozome v. <dig>  <cit>  using bowtie  <cit> . with a stringent criterion of  <dig> mismatches within the 16-nucleotide tag alignments, most of the tags aligned to the models but large numbers of tags did not. in order to retrieve alignments in the cases where the computationally predicted glyma models did not call sufficient 3'utr sequence, we extended the glyma models at both the 5' and 3' ends by  <dig> bases in each direction. this analysis produced more hits of tags that corresponded to the extra left, junction left, junction right, and extra right region in addition to the model . these data show that the current computational models from the soybean genome are likely incomplete for especially for the 3' end. of the approximately  <dig>  million tags in each library, we found that  <dig>  million aligned to one or more of the extended soybean genome models. the remainder showed no alignment to any model or to the extended glyma models. non-aligned sequences might be attributed at least partially to single nucleotide differences in the soybean cultivars used in this study  as compared to the references soybean genome  since a  <dig> mismatch criteria was used in the alignments.

an example that illustrates multiple dge tags found in a single glyma model is glyma04g <dig>  that matches five dge tags: dge <dig>  dge <dig>  dge <dig>  dge <dig>  and dge <dig> . out of these  <dig> tags, only dge <dig> originates from the authentic position within glyma04g <dig> because this tag sequence is adjacent to the last dpnii site in 3'utr and additionally its abundance represents a normalized count of  <dig> tags per million aligned dge reads in the cs line as compared to other less abundant tags that likely originate from incomplete restriction digestion of dpnii sites on either the positive or negative strands. for example, dge <dig> and dge <dig> likely originate from restricted fragments, which were not washed away after digestion of cdna with dpnii . dge <dig> and dge <dig> originate due to inefficient restriction by dpnii . thus, dge <dig> is the authentic tag representing the transcript for glyma04g <dig> . as will be discussed later, the abundance of transcripts originating from the authentic dge tag position dge <dig> is very high in cs and dramatically reduced in cg . additionally, all of the less abundant secondary tags from different positions showed much lower counts in the cg line, indicating that they all arise from the same glyma model, glyma04g <dig>  one dge tag can also match to more than one glyma model. for instance, dge <dig> matches two glyma models: glyma03g <dig> and glyma19g <dig> . this dge <dig> tag originates from glyma19g <dig> because the sequence of this dge tag is adjacent to the last dpnii site in its 3'utr as expected according to the protocol used for mrna sequencing by illumina.

transcriptome comparison of clark standard and clark glabrous with dge tag profiling
approximately  <dig>  unique tags representing over  <dig>  million dge tags that aligned to the extended glyma cdna predicted gene models of the soybean genome were generated from each line of the cs and cg isolines and counts were normalized per million aligned  reads. the resulting transcriptome datasets identified highly expressed genes as well as differentially expressed genes between young shoot tips of cs and cg isolines. the top  <dig> highly expressed genes  in both genotypes were divided into  <dig> broad functional categories  and their percentage distribution is illustrated in figure 3b. as shown in figure 3a, the genes from the top  <dig> categories that were highly expressed in shoot tip of cs and cg encode proteins related to: ribosomes , protein biosynthesis/metabolism , photosynthesis , other , and histones . in addition to automated annotations to the soybean references genome  <cit>  and other databases, the annotation of these dge tags were verified manually using blast searches to the soybean est databases as described in the materials and methods section. the matches to specific ests are shown in the additional file  <dig>  this approach also verified direct expression of the dge tags that were located in the extended glyma model regions.

tags that were either ≥2-fold over or under-expressed in cs in comparison with cg with a minimum of  <dig> counts per tag per million mapped reads were also analyzed in greater detail. of these,  <dig>  showed ≥2-fold over-expression in cs as compared to cg and  <dig> were under-expressed in cs. of those, some showing the greatest differential expression  are shown in table  <dig> 

dge is normalized per million tags and rna-seq is shown in rpkm *glyma model has snp in their tag sequence.

among the tags overexpressed in the cs line, one particular tag corresponds to a gene located on glyma <dig> chromosome, specifically glyma04g <dig>  and showed >2000-fold expression difference between cs/cg =  <dig> / <dig>  tags per million aligned tags . the glyma04g <dig> gene is a member of the burp gene family. it has high homology to the cotton gene- resistance to drought rd22-like  <dig> , involved in cotton fiber initiation and member of the burp protein domain family  <cit> . soybean has a total of  <dig> burp domain containing genes and burp gene family members from other species are known to have diverse functions  <cit> . some of the proposed functions of burp family members include: regulation of fruit ripening in tomato  <cit> , response to drought stress induced by abscisic acid in arabidopsis  <cit> , tapetum development in rice  <cit> , and seed coat development in soybean  <cit> . in clark, the dge <dig> tag found to correspond to glyma04g <dig> is the 12th most abundant tag in the dge data set. for perspective, the 4th most abundant tag with a normalized count of  <dig>  tags matches a chlorophyll a/b binding factor as do several of the most abundant tags .

for further verification of differential expression, we used deseq package in r without replications as described  <cit> . this condition relies on the assumption that in the isolines most genes will be similarly expressed, thus treating the two lines as repeats. this analysis produced the same list of significant up and down-regulated genes. lists of all differentially expressed genes in cs versus cg or vice versa are shown in additional file 4a &4b, respectively, using the deseq package.

comparison of dge data with rna-seq
the sequencing of cs and cg transcriptome by rna-seq generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  million 75-bp reads, respectively from an independent biological sample of the cs and cg shoot tips. these tags were mapped to the  <dig>  soybean gene models using bowtie  <cit> . rna-seq data was normalized in reads per kilo base of gene model per million mapped reads  as the sensitivity of rna-seq depends on the transcript length  <cit> . rna-seq analysis revealed that at the cutoff point of  <dig> rpkm, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were expressed in cs and cg, respectively. at a cutoff of  <dig> rpkm, however,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were expressed in cs and cg, respectively. together, the results suggest that in the rna-seq transcriptome, ~50% of genes are expressed in both wild-type and mutant soybean.

the genes that showed over expression in cs compared to cg or vice versa in dge data were compared with rna-seq data. table  <dig> shows some of the rna-seq data compared to the dge data that have the same trend, i.e. over or under expression in cs relative to cg. among the burp genes, rna-seq data has enabled nearly the same trend of differential expression and has confirmed that glyma04g <dig> burp gene is over expressed in cs compared to cg. similarly, among the seven burp genes, four genes: glyma04g <dig>  glyma07g <dig>  glyma14g <dig>  and glyma14g <dig> showed a same trend in both rna-seq and dge data .

rna blots confirm the dramatic transcript level differences of glyma <dig> burp gene in clark standard and clark glabrous
to validate the transcriptome data for the burp gene, we performed rna blot analysis for the glyma04g <dig> burp gene. total rna was isolated from mature soybean tissues and the probe was amplified from glyma04g <dig> burp est: gm-r1083- <dig>  rna blots performed on cotyledon, hypocotyl, leaf, and root organs revealed that the glyma04g <dig> burp gene had strong transcript level differences among different organs in cs and cg, which validated the dge data . the presence of two bands in cs root tissue might be explained by cross hybridization of the probe to more than one of the seven burp genes present in the soybean genome as the burp est showed seven matches when used as a blast against the soybean reference genome  <cit>  using tblastn program. the seven glyma models that correspond to each feature were identified: glyma04g <dig>  glyma04g <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  glyma06g <dig>  glyma07g <dig>  glyma14g <dig>  and glyma14g <dig> 

dna blot comparison of the glyma04g <dig> burp gene in clark standard and clark glabrous
dna blot analysis was carried out to identify potential burp gene rflps between cs and cg isolines. the same cdna pcr product used as a probe in rna blots was used for the glyma04g <dig> burp gene dna blots. genomic dna was digested with six different restriction enzymes  and taken through the dna blot protocol. the resulting blot shows several bands in the cs digests, not seen in the cg samples . these apparently missing bands may represent an insertion/deletion  in the glyma04g <dig> burp gene or in burp gene family members, which is elucidated further by direct sequence analysis .

sequence analysis of glyma04g <dig> burp gene of clark standard and clark glabrous
the glyma04g <dig> burp gene sequence from cv. williams  <dig> was used to design pcr primers to amplify the corresponding genomic regions in both cs and cg. to determine the gene structures in cs and cg, the cdna sequence was produced from rt-pcr using primers within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions for glyma04g <dig>  sequencing of these fragments indicated that the glyma04g <dig> burp gene in cs and cg contains an additional exon and intron, for a total of four exons and three introns , relative to the cv. williams  <dig> sequence. the comparison of cv. williams  <dig> glyma04g <dig> burp transcript sequence with those of cs and cg revealed various single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and indels including two insertions of around  <dig> bp at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the third exon of both cs and cg. from these two insertions, the first insertion created a premature stop codon in the transcript and resulted in a frameshift in the peptide sequence of cs; addition of one nucleotide c at position  <dig> in cg causes a frameshift mutation that results in premature stop codon in cg transcripts  and peptides . extensive sequence analysis revealed that two insertions in cs and cg are actually repeats, a prominent feature of burp domain containing genes . surprisingly, the last intron of the glyma04g <dig> burp gene in cv. williams  <dig>  cs, and cg contains another predicted gene-glyma04g <dig>  encoding spermidine synthase .

however, the sequence differences between the cs and cg glyma04g <dig> gene do not account for all the potential rflps seen in the dna blots. likely this is explained as the est probe used for rflp showed several matches in the soybean reference genome  <cit>  when used as a blast that could reflect unaccounted rflps in the dna blots . seven potential burp gene family members were found in the reference soybean genome  <cit>  and these burp gene family members are scattered on various chromosomes in the soybean genome  as expected since soybean is a an ancient tetraploid. the gene models that showed varying degrees of similarity with the probe were analyzed in dge and rna-seq data to check their differential gene expression . among them we again found the glyma04g <dig> burp gene located on the chromosome  <dig>  with high identity to the burp probe and also expressed differentially in cs and cg . the remaining seven burp domain containing genes that showed significant similarity with the lowest e values to the burp est probe in phytozome do not show expression differences between cs and cg .

expression analysis of soybean orthologs to known genes involved in trichome development reveal low transcript levels in young shoot tips of both lines
the genes involved in the initiation of trichome development have been particularly well characterized in arabidopsis. the gl1-ttg1-gl3/egl <dig> transcription factor complex has been posited to play a role in trichome development as mutations in these genes result in loss of trichomes  <cit> . we sought to look at differential expression of genes that are positive and negative regulators of trichome development in both lines . expression of these orthologs is very low as determined by rna-seq and dge data. none of the genes described from previous reports as essential for trichome development showed higher transcript counts in our dge data and rna-seq data, and likewise did not vary substantially. for instance, in the dge transcriptome from shoot tip, the expression of gl <dig> gl <dig>  gl <dig>  and ttg <dig> showed the opposite trend with some exceptions . one explanation to this discrepancy is that trichome development commences at a very early stage of leaf development, even before the leaf primordial is differentiated, so that these transcription factors might have been differentially expressed at higher levels at earlier stages of development of the trichomes. thus, our dge and rna-seq data may reflect genes that are expressed preferentially in trichomes and not necessarily in the early signaling stages of trichome formation.

dge is normalized per million tags and rna-seq is shown in rpkm

other studies have shown that myb transcription factor genes caprice , trichomeless  and triptychon  are negative regulators of trichome development  <cit> . elevated levels of spls  produced fewer trichomes in arabidopsis. spl <dig> directly activates the expression of myb transcription factor genes such as trichomeless <dig>  and triptychon , which are the negative regulators of trichome development  <cit> . again, no substantial differences were found between the two soybean genotypes .

discussion
while microarrays have been used extensively to reveal physiological trends from transcriptome analyses of soybean developmental stages or organ systems, fewer reports to date have focused on transcriptome analysis of near isogenic lines using either microarrays  <cit>  or high throughput sequence analysis  <cit> . here we compared high throughput sequencing using digital gene expression and rna-seq transcriptome profiles of wild-type soybean  and a glabrous-mutant  with the dominant p <dig> mutation in soybean. dge produces 16-nucleotide long tags generally specific to 3' end of each mrna that provide information on quantitative expression of genes, rare transcripts, and also reveals novel or unannotated genes. however, since dge data often represent the 3' end, it is essential that the databases or reference genome contain that information. we found that many of the annotated gene models in the soybean gene do not extend sufficiently to represent the dge tags and extending the models to  <dig> bases at the 5' and 3' ends enables many more tags to align to the models.

compared to dge, rna-seq produces even greater numbers of reads, up to hundreds of millions in one sequencing lane. the reads are also longer, generally  <dig> bp and correspond to the entire coding region thus giving more depth and range of coverage. the majority of the genes that are over-expressed in cs as compared to cg were also over expressed in rna-seq data or a vice versa but their expression fold changes were different. the use of different technology in dge and rna-seq that produced  <dig> bp tags from 3'ends and  <dig> bp tags from whole transcripts, respectively, resulted in differences between dge and rna-seq data. rna-seq is potentially a more comprehensive way to measure transcriptome abundance, composition, and splice variants, and it also enables discover of new exons or genes. soybean has a large and highly duplicated genome, rich in paralogs and gene families. this presents a challenge when mapping dge tags to a specific gene, since they could equally well map to the other gene homologs in the genome. yet, both dge and rna-seq data has enabled nearly the same trend of differential expression for many of the gene models.

dge and rna-seq analyses of cs and cg soybean isolines revealed several hundred genes with differential expression. among them, the glyma04g <dig> burp gene had a strong transcript level differences between the two lines. additional validation came from rna blots, which confirmed that the glyma04g <dig> burp gene was strongly expressed in cs tissues and not in the glabrous cg isolines. there are also structural  differences between the cs and cg isolines for this gene. however, the parallel of high transcript levels for trichome-containing plants breaks down for the cv. williams  <dig> which has trichomes but also has a very low level of transcripts in shoot tips of the glyma04g <dig> burp gene as shown by northern blotting . the most distinguishing structural feature difference between the glyma04g <dig> burp genes in the three cultivars is the presence of the  <dig> bp repeats, and an additional exon in the cs and cg lines compared to cv. williams  <dig>  and the addition of one nucleotide c in cg as compared to the other two.

the glyma04g <dig> burp gene showed high homology to the cotton gene resistance to drought rd22-like  <dig>  that is involved in cotton fiber initiation and is also a member of the burp protein family. the glyma04g <dig> burp gene and scb <dig>  seed coat burp domain protein  <dig>  fall into one burp protein family- burpv, when  <dig> burp proteins from different species were classified into  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . scb <dig> may play a role in the differentiation of the seed coat parenchyma cells and is localized on the cell wall of soybean  <cit> . but it should be noted that despite high sequence homology among the burp domain containing genes, the function of each burp protein seems to greatly vary among plants. the glyma04g <dig> burp gene does not seem to have a direct role in trichome formation but the possibility is open that it may be indirectly involved in some soybean genotypes.

although sequence comparison of transcripts from cv. williams  <dig>  cs, and cg showed 98% identity, but it also revealed various snp's, insertions, and deletions in cs and cg when compared to cv. williams  <dig> . these differences in the transcript sequences such as ~ <dig> bp insertion in the third exon of cs and addition of one nucleotide c in cg resulted in premature stop codons and also disturbed the frame in both cs and cg . one might also expect differences in the upstream promoter regions of the glyma04g <dig> burp between cs and cg genes based on the dramatic transcript level differences between the two genotypes as shown by dge and confirmed by rna blotting. the number of rflps seen in the cs vs. cg dna blots suggested more family members that may differ by various indels. by comparing the burp est probe against the cv. williams  <dig> soybean genome sequence  <cit> , seven potential burp gene family members were found that have sequence homology to the probe  but only glyma04g <dig> stood out as highly differentially expressed between the two genotypes. up to  <dig> total genes with burp protein domains exist in soybean  <cit>  but only seven are related to the glyma04g <dig> as assessed by e value of <10- <dig> 

some genes involved in the initiation of trichome development have been particularly well characterized in arabidopsis. as shown in table  <dig>  the transcript levels of soybean orthologs to some of the arabidopsis genes were very low and did not vary considerably between the two genotypes even in the rna-seq data that yielded nearly  <dig> million mapped reads from the young shoot tips of each genotype. it may be necessary to assay earlier stages of trichome development using laser capture microdissection to find transcripts in early trichome formation in specific cell types. alternatively, soybean may have different and undiscovered mechanisms for trichome formation.

CONCLUSIONS
digital gene profiling and high throughput rna-seq revealed thousands of genes expressed in young trifoliate shoot tips of soybean. the data show a direct comparison of both methods. many genes show agreement of the same trend of gene expression between the isolines but the two techniques produce differences in the ratios. both methods allowed distinguishing gene family members in many cases. comparison of isolines delineated changes in transcript abundance between wild-type soybean and glabrous-mutant on a genome-wide scale. many genes showed similar expression levels between the two isolines as expected but the data also delineated the genes that are over-expressed or under-expressed in cs and may provide an insight into trichome gene expression in soybean, as the cg mutants lack any non glandular trichomes. the identification of a highly expressed member of the burp gene family, glyma04g <dig>  in cs that has almost no transcript presence in cg, may indicate its involvement in trichome formation or function in certain genotypes although it is not a candidate for the dominant p <dig> locus. orthologs for arabidopsis genes involved in trichome development were only very weakly expressed and did not vary considerabley between the two genotypes. this study represents a first step in expanding the study of trichome genetics into the economically important soybean plant.
